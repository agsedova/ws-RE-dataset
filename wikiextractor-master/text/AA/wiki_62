{"id": "1865928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865928", "title": "Adam Dalgliesh", "text": "Adam Dalgliesh\n\nAdam Dalgliesh (pronounced \"dal-gleash\") is a fictional character who has been the protagonist of fourteen mystery novels by P. D. James; the first being James's 1962 novel \"Cover Her Face\". He also appears in the two novels featuring James's other detective, Cordelia Gray. \n\nIn the first novel, Dalgliesh is a Detective Chief Inspector. He eventually reaches the rank of Commander in the Metropolitan Police Service at New Scotland Yard in London. He is an intensely cerebral and private person. He writes poetry, a fact about which his colleagues are fond of reminding him. Several volumes of his poetry have been published. Dalgliesh lives in a flat above the Thames at Queenhithe in the City of London. In the earlier novels he drives a Cooper Bristol, later a Jaguar. He was described as being \"tall, dark and handsome\" by some women, alluding to Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\".\n\nHis father was the rector of a Norfolk country parish. His sole family relation was his aunt, Jane Dalgliesh, whom he held in high esteem. After her death, Dalgliesh inherits, among other bequests, a converted windmill located on the Norfolk coast. In his lengthy career, he has been quite astute and successful and now heads a squad of CID officers working on only the most sensitive cases.\n\nDalgliesh is a widower. He lost his wife in childbirth 13 years before \"A Mind to Murder,\" and was reluctant to commit himself ever since. His relationship with Deborah Riscoe ended because of this. During his time at St. Anselm's in Suffolk, he meets Cambridge lecturer Emma Lavenham and later asks her to marry him. The wedding takes place at the end of \"The Private Patient\", published in 2008.\n\nDalgliesh is a late example of the gentleman detective, a staple of British detective fiction. A number of parallels may be drawn between Dalgliesh and another contemporary fictional detective, Inspector Morse.\n\nDCI Dalgliesh was named in honor of the author's English teacher at Cambridge High School; years later she learnt that by mere chance, Miss Dalgliesh's father had in fact been named Adam.\n\n\nCordelia Gray mysteries:\n\n\nDetective Sergeant Martin is Dalgliesh's partner in \"Cover Her Face\" and \"A Mind to Murder\". (Martin is played in the ITV adaptation by Robert Pugh.) In \"Shroud for a Nightingale\" he partners with Detective Sergeant Masterson. Dalgliesh's first permanent partner was the moody and arrogant Detective Chief Inspector Massingham (played by John Vine). Detective Inspector Kate Miskin (played for ITV by Penny Downie, Lizzy McInnery and Sarah Winman, and for the BBC by Tilly Blackwood) serves with Dalgliesh and Massingham in Scotland Yard's Special Investigation Squad. In \"The Lighthouse\", Miskin takes over running the investigation when Dalgliesh contracts SARS. She is still a member of Dalgliesh's team in \"The Private Patient\" (2008).\n\nDI Daniel Aron (Tim Dutton) replaces Massingham when Massingham leaves Scotland Yard to succeed his late father in the House of Lords. Aron is presumably suspended after the events of \"Original Sin\"; DI Piers Tarrant (William Beck) is his replacement. When Tarrant is then transferred to Special Branch, DS Francis Benton-Smith replaces him. (Miskin has a short romantic relationship with Piers Tarrant after he leaves the Squad.) Benton-Smith, the ambitious and good-looking son of English and Indian parents, is at first resented by Kate Miskin, but they develop a good working relationship.\n\nJane Dalgliesh is Adam Dalgiesh's aunt and his sole living relative until her death prior to \"Devices and Desires\". Introduced in \"Unnatural Causes\", she is described as a very private and cerebral person, not unlike Dalgliesh himself. She is fond of bird watching and possesses a cottage in Suffolk which she later sells and buys a converted windmill in Norfolk, which Dalgliesh inherits upon her death.\n\nConrad Ackroyd is one of Dalgliesh's personal friends. He is a member of the \"Cadaver Club\", a private club of crime enthusiasts featured in \"Unnatural Causes\" as well as other novels. He is editor and publisher of \"The Paternoster Review\". Ackroyd's connections in the London establishment are often an asset to Dalgliesh.\n\nDeborah Riscoe (played by Mel Martin) is one of Dalgliesh's romantic interests; they first meet when a murder shakes Riscoe's home in \"Cover Her Face\"; their relationship develops over the course of \"A Mind to Murder\". However, because of Dalgliesh's reluctance to commit, Riscoe ends their relationship via a letter at the conclusion of \"Unnatural Causes\", accepting a transfer to the United States of America.\n\nEmma Lavenham (played by Janie Dee) is a lecturer in literature at Cambridge University. She and Dalgleish meet in \"Death in Holy Orders\", develop a relationship during \"The Murder Room\", and, following Dalgliesh's convalescence from SARS on Combe Island (in \"The Lighthouse\"), decide to marry, which they do at the end of \"The Private Patient\".\n\nDalgliesh makes several small appearances in the two novels in the Cordelia Gray series, \"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\" and \"The Skull Beneath the Skin\". Cordelia Gray is a private detective and runs a detective agency in Kingsly Street. Dalgliesh is asked to look into the death of Sir Ronald Callender in Cambridge and acquits Gray of any charges. Gray and Dalgliesh stayed in contact, as evidenced by the congratulations card Dalgliesh receives from Gray while convalescing after a successful operation at the beginning of \"The Black Tower\". Gossiping Conrad Ackroyd also remarks on Dalgliesh's being seen dining out with Cordelia in \"A Taste for Death\".\n\nAll of James's novels featuring Adam Dalgliesh up to and including \"The Murder Room\" have been adapted for television, beginning with \"Death of an Expert Witness\" in 1983. The first ten novels (in the order shown below) were adapted by Anglia Television for transmission on the ITV network and starred Roy Marsden as Dalgliesh. The BBC took over the series in 2003, and Martin Shaw played the role in \"Death in Holy Orders\" and \"The Murder Room\". The television adaptations have not always been faithful to the novel they dramatise, partly because they are out of chronological order.\n\n\nFive of the Dalgliesh novels have been dramatised by Neville Teller for BBC Radio 4. Robin Ellis played Dalgliesh in \"Cover Her Face\" (1993; miscredited as \"Robert\" Ellis by the BBC announcer) and \"Devices and Desires\" (1998). Phillip Franks played the role in \"A Certain Justice\" (2005). Dalgliesh was then played by Richard Derrington in \"A Taste for Death\" (2008) and \"The Private Patient\" (2010).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865937", "title": "Harry Bloom", "text": "Harry Bloom\n\nHarry Saul Bloom (1 January 1913 – 28 July 1981) was a South African journalist, novelist, activist and lecturer.\n\nSolomon Harris Bloom was born into a Jewish South African family. He was educated at the University of the Witwatersrand, obtaining his law degree in 1937. He subsequently became an advocate in Johannesburg. In 1940, he married Beryl Cynthia Gordon, after knowing her three weeks, and they moved to London, living in Old Compton Street during the Blitz. Writing under the pseudonyms Walter and Beryl Storm (to avoid anti-Semitism), they worked as war correspondents during the Second World War, and covered the Nuremberg trials after the war.\n\nThe couple moved to Czechoslovakia and together they wrote the book \"We meet the Czechoslovaks\", an account of their early years in Czechoslovakia, also under the Storm pseudonyms. Beryl later played an active role in editing, advising and typing the manuscripts for his subsequent books. Fearful for their security as Stalinism gained strength in post-war Eastern Europe, they returned to South Africa, and settled in Bramley, Johannesburg. In 1957, a few months after Bloom's first novel, \"Episode in the Transvaal\", was published, the family moved to Cape Town.\n\n\"Episode\", a novel, was published in 1956; it was later retitled \"Transvaal Episode\". It was dedicated to four people: his wife Beryl, who provided editorial assistance and typed the manuscript; Bram Fischer, Bloom's close friend who defended Nelson Mandela at the Rivonia Trial; Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, and Guy Routh. Bloom worked with Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg in the 1950s. During the state of emergency that followed the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, he was detained for 45 days without charges or trial, first at Roeland Street Prison and later at Worcester Prison near Cape Town. He worked on \"Whittaker's Wife\" (1962) during this time. \"King Kong: An African Jazz Opera\" (1961) became a musical. \"Episode\" was republished in 1981.\n\nIn 1963, Bloom left South Africa for Kenya, mainly due to his opposition to apartheid, and then moved to England. According to \"The Times\", he came to England \"in search of a new life, mainly as an academic and a journalist.\" His wife and children stayed behind in South Africa.\n\nIn 1967, Bloom was appointed Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Kent. With founding law professor Patrick Fitzgerald, he helped to set up the first Law Department at the University which was rooted in an interdisciplinary ethos. Bloom went on to collaborate with Igor Aleksander, now Emeritus Professor at Imperial College London, on the societal impact of computer networks and then worked for a newly set up Unit for Legal Research in Computer and Communications, which considered the legal protection of computer software and retrieval of statutes. This involved meetings with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations, which was created in 1967 \"to encourage creative activity and to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world.\" Many of the components of his work, and the articles he wrote, had a significant impact in the early days of the transition from the offline into the online world. He has been remembered \"as the founder of the teaching of the law affecting the media in the UK.\"\n\nAfter the war, Bloom and wife Beryl returned to Durban, South Africa, where their first child, Peter, was born in 1944, but he died aged six weeks. In October 1948, their daughter Susan Storm-Bloom, a photographer and jewellery designer, was born in Prague. Their son Stephen Jack Bloom, a photographer and author, was born in Johannesburg in 1953.\n\nHarry and Beryl divorced shortly after Bloom moved to London in 1963. There he met Sonia Copeland, a journalist and writer, and they married in Canterbury, Kent, in 1967. Sonia had two children fathered from an affair with Harry Bloom’s student, Colin Stone - Samantha Bloom (born 1975) and actor Orlando Bloom (born January 1977), who until age 13 believed Harry Bloom was their biological father.\n\nBloom suffered a stroke in 1976. After a period of declining health, he died in a Canterbury hospital in 1981.\n"}

{"id": "1865964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865964", "title": "Charlie Musselwhite", "text": "Charlie Musselwhite\n\nCharles Douglas Musselwhite (born January 31, 1944) is an American electric blues harmonica player and bandleader, one of the white bluesmen who came to prominence in the early 1960s, along with Mike Bloomfield and Paul Butterfield. He has often been identified as a \"white bluesman\". Musselwhite was reportedly the inspiration for Elwood Blues; the character played by Dan Aykroyd in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers.\n\nMusselwhite was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi to white parents. In a 2005 interview, he said his mother had told him he was of distant Cherokee descent. His family considered it natural to play music. His father played guitar and harmonica, his mother played piano, and a relative was a one-man band.\n\nAt the age of three, Musselwhite moved to Memphis, Tennessee. When he was a teenager, Memphis experienced the period when rockabilly, western swing, and electric blues were combining to give birth to rock and roll. That period featured Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and lesser-known musicians such as Gus Cannon, Furry Lewis, Will Shade, and Johnny Burnette. Musselwhite supported himself by digging ditches, laying concrete and running moonshine in a automobile. This environment was a school for music as well as life for Musselwhite, who eventually acquired the nickname Memphis Charlie.\n\nIn true bluesman fashion, Musselwhite then took off in search of the rumored \"big-paying factory jobs\" up the \"Hillbilly Highway\", Highway 51 to Chicago, where he continued his education on the South Side, making the acquaintance of even more legends, including Lew Soloff, Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Big Walter Horton. Musselwhite immersed himself completely in the musical life, living in the basement of and occasionally working at Jazz Record Mart (the record store operated by Delmark Records founder Bob Koester) with Big Joe Williams and working as a driver for an exterminator, which allowed him to observe what was happening around the city's clubs and bars. He spent his time hanging out at the Jazz Record Mart, at the corner of State and Grand, and a nearby bar, Mr. Joe's, with the city's blues musicians, and sitting in with Williams and others in the clubs, playing for tips. There he forged a lifelong friendship with John Lee Hooker; though Hooker lived in Detroit, Michigan, the two often visited each other, and Hooker served as best man at Musselwhite's third marriage to Henrietta Musselwhite. Gradually Musselwhite became well known around town.\n\nIn time, Musselwhite led his own blues band, and after Elektra Records' success with Paul Butterfield, he released the legendary album \"Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band\" in 1966 on Vanguard Records to immediate and great success. He took advantage of the clout this album gave him to move to San Francisco, where, instead of being one of many competing blues acts, he held court as the king of the blues in the exploding countercultural music scene, an exotic and gritty figure to the flower children. Musselwhite even convinced Hooker to move to California.\n\nSince then, Musselwhite has released over 20 albums and has been a guest performer on albums by many other musicians, such as Bonnie Raitt's \"Longing in Their Hearts\" and the Blind Boys of Alabama's \"Spirit of the Century\", both winners of Grammy Awards. He also performed on Tom Waits's \"Mule Variations\" and INXS's \"Suicide Blonde\". He has won 14 Blues Music Awards, has been nominated for six Grammy Awards. received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Monterey Blues Festival and the San Javier Jazz Festival, in San Javier, Spain, and received the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts.\n\nIn 1979, Musselwhite recorded \"The Harmonica According to Charlie Musselwhite\" in London for Kicking Mule Records, intended to accompany an instructional book; the album became so popular that it was released on CD. In June 2008, Blind Pig Records reissued the album on 180-gram vinyl with new cover art. \n\nIn 1990 Musselwhite signed with Alligator Records, a step that led to a resurgence of his career.\n\nIn 1998, Musselwhite appeared in the film \"Blues Brothers 2000\". He played the harmonica in the Louisiana Gator Boys, which featured many other blues and R&B legends, such as B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Eric Clapton, Koko Taylor, Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John, and Jack DeJohnette.\n\nOver the years, Musselwhite has branched out in style. His 1999 recording, \"Continental Drifter\", is accompanied by Cuarteto Patria, from Cuba's Santiago region, the Cuban music counterpart of the Mississippi Delta. Because of political differences between Cuba and the United States, the album was recorded in Bergen, Norway, with Musselwhite's wife handling the details.\n\nMusselwhite believes the key to his musical success was finding a style in which he could express himself. He said, \"I only know one tune, and I play it faster or slower, or I change the key, but it's just the one tune I've ever played in my life. It's all I know.\"\n\nHis past two albums, \"Sanctuary\" and \"Delta Hardware\", were released by Real World Records.\n\nMusselwhite played on Tom Waits's 1999 album \"Mule Variations\". He can be heard at the beginning of the song \"Chocolate Jesus\", saying \"I love it\". Waits has mentioned that this is his favorite part of the song.\n\nIn 2002, he was featured on the Bo Diddley tribute album \"Hey Bo Diddley: A Tribute!\", performing the song \"Hey Bo Diddley\".\n\nMusselwhite lost both of his elderly parents in December 2005, in separate incidents. His mother, Ruth Maxine Musselwhite, was murdered.\n\nMusselwhite joined the judging panel of the 10th annual Independent Music Awards, to assist independent musicians' careers. He was also a judge for the 7th and 9th Independent Music Awards.\n\nMusselwhite was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2010. The same year, he appeared on the JW-Jones recording \"Midnight Memphis Sun\", along with Hubert Sumlin. Also in 2010, he released the album \"The Well\". In the title song he credits Jessica McClure's ordeal as a child trapped in a well for over 58 hours in 1987 for inspiring him to quit drinking, stating, She was trapped in there with a broken arm in the dark, in a life-and-death situation she was singing nursery rhymes to herself and being brave...It made my problems seem tiny. So as a prayer to her and myself, I decided I wasn't going to drink till she got out of that well. It was like I was tricking myself, telling myself that I wasn't going to quit for good, just until she got out. It took three days to get her out, and I haven't had a drink since.\n\nFor the first half of 2011, Musselwhite toured with the acoustic-electric blues band Hot Tuna. In the latter half of 2011, he went on tour with Cyndi Lauper, having played harmonica on her hit album \"Memphis Blues\". While on this tour, he appeared with Lauper on Jools Holland's television program \"Hootenanny\" on New Year's Eve 2011, performing a modified arrangement of Lauper's signature song, \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\".\n\nIn 2012, Musselewhite released the live album Juke Joint Chapel which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album. Musselwhite also teamed with Ben Harper to record the album \"Get Up!,\" which was released in January 2013. In January 2014, it won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, he won a Blues Music Award in the category Best Instrumentalist – Harmonicist.\n\nAt the 40th Blues Music Awards ceremony in 2019, Musselwhite's joint composition with Ben Harper, \"No Mercy In This Land\", was named as 'Song of the Year'.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his character \"Brozo el Payaso Tenebroso\" (Brozo the Creepy Clown), a green-haired, unkempt, obscene and aggressive clown (an anti-clown).\n\nTrujillo was born in Mexico City. In 1987, after appearing in an Imevisión variety show called \"En tienda y trastienda\" (\"Front and Back of House\"), Trujillo created a new program called \"La caravana\" (\"The Caravan\"), alongside his \"Tienda y trastienda\" partner Ausencio Cruz. \"La caravana\" was a successful show with skits played by characters created by Trujillo and Cruz, with a comedy style calling back to the era of carpas. It featured characters such as \"Estetoscopio Medina Cháirez\", played by Trujillo, representing a low-class Mexican guy with a funny accent, who spoke ironically of the way of life of the poor. \"La caravana\" also marked the first on-air appearance of \"Brozo\", where he told heavily modified fairy tales in front of the camera; the modifications reflected the realities of crime and poverty in the Mexican ghetto. The success of the two programs brought advertising revenues to Imevisión, which by the early 1990s was airing steadily more foreign productions. Trujillo later had a nighttime program as another character, \"La Beba Galván\", this time without Cruz.\n\nTrujillo continued with TV Azteca, Imevisión's successor, hosting programs including \"El Diario de la Noche\" until 2000. That year, he brought his act to Canal 40, where \"Brozo\" was host of his own news program called \"El Mañanero\" as an anchorman and political commentator. An obvious intelligent man behind the make-up of a clown, Victor Trujillo could criticize freely and poignantly the actors of the political scene (not very reputed among the general public), and soon his program received high ratings and featured high-profile politicians; it also began being simulcast on some Grupo ACIR radio stations.\n\nIn 2001, after 16 months, Trujillo left Canal 40 in order to sign a contract with Televisa and move his program there, which he said would allow him to take on a wider variety of projects. For instance, he appeared on programs surrounding the 2002 FIFA World Cup and hosted a season of Big Brother México.\n\nBrozo played an important role in the most damaging of the videoscandals that affected Mexico City mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador. On \"El Mañanero\", a video given to Trujillo by then-ALDF deputy Federico Döring Casar was publicly played, showing René Bejarano filling a briefcase with dollars given by entrepreneur Carlos Ahumada; this was followed immediately by a studio interview with an unsuspecting Bejarano, who saw the video for the first time on the spot. Trujillo would later be called on to testify in the criminal case that resulted.\n\nAfter the 2004 death of Carolina Padilla (both his wife and his program's producer) due to a brain hemorrhage suffered the year before, Trujillo cancelled \"El Mañanero\", stating that he was putting Brozo \"in the freezer\". Some time later, he started a new, similar show called \"El cristal con que se mira\" (\"The Looking Glass\"), this time as himself. In 2005, Trujillo caused the downfall of PRI presidential precandidate Arturo Montiel, when he announced as confirmed a current inquiry on Montiel's family and personal fortune. This inquiry was later denied by the government, but the damage was done, and Montiel quit the presidential race a few days later.\n\nAfter \"El Cristal\", along with \"El Circo de Brozo\"—a program that marked the return of the Brozo character—were cancelled in 2006, Trujillo (as \"Brozo\") had another nighttime show called \"El NotiFiero\". In 2010, however, \"El Mañanero\" returned to the air, this time on Televisa's news channel FOROtv. It left the air in 2016 as part of a larger reorganization of Televisa's news output and to make way for a new weekly program on Canal 2.\n\nTrujillo has lent his voice to a variety of animated and other series, as well as Spanish-language dubs for the Mexican market. Among his more notable roles in this capacity have been Lion-O in \"ThunderCats\", James Bond in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", Sulley in \"Monsters, Inc.\" and \"Monsters University\" and Shere Khan in the Mexican release of \"The Jungle Book\".\n\nIn 2006, Trujillo released \"Cuentos Tenebrozos\", a collection of \"true\" short stories.\n\n"}

Plants are variable in leaf and flower shape and have in the past been separated out as different subspecies due to these variable shapes. Currently most taxonomic treatments include these different forms in one highly variable species. In bloodroot, the juice is red and poisonous.\n\nBloodroot grows from tall. It has one large basal leaf, up to across, with five to seven lobes. The leaves and flowers sprout from a reddish rhizome with bright orange sap that grows at or slightly below the soil surface. The color of the sap is the reason for the genus name \"Sanguinaria\", from Latin \"bloody\". The rhizomes grow longer each year, and branch to form colonies. Plants start to bloom before the foliage unfolds in early spring. After blooming the leaves unfurl to their full size and go summer dormant in mid to late summer, later than some other spring ephemerals.\n\nThe flowers bloom from March to May depending on the region and weather. They have 8–12 delicate white petals, many yellow stamens, and two sepals below the petals, which fall off after the flowers open. Each flower stem is clasped by a leaf as it emerges from the ground. The flowers open when they are in sunlight. They are pollinated by small bees and flies. Seeds develop in green pods long, and ripen before the foliage goes dormant. The seeds are round and black to orange-red when ripe, and have white elaiosomes, which are eaten by ants.\n\nBloodroot is native to eastern North America from Nova Scotia, Canada southward to Florida, United States, and west to Great Lakes and down the Mississippi embayment.\n\n\"Sanguinaria canadensis\" plants are found growing in moist to dry woods and thickets, often on floodplains and near shores or streams on slopes. They grow less frequently in clearings and meadows or on dunes, and are rarely found in disturbed sites. Deer will feed on the plants in early spring.\n\nBloodroot is one of many plants whose seeds are spread by ants, a process called myrmecochory. The seeds have a fleshy organ called an elaiosome that attracts ants. The ants take the seeds to their nest, where they eat the elaiosomes, and put the seeds in their nest debris, where they are protected until they germinate. They also benefit from growing in a medium made richer by the ant nest debris.\n\nThe flowers produce pollen, but no nectar. Various bees and flies visit the flowers looking in vain for nectar, for instance sweat bees in the genera \"Lasioglossum\" and \"Halictus\", cuckoo bees in the genus \"Nomada\", small carpenter bees (\"Ceratina\"), and bee flies in the genus \"Bombylius\". Some bees come to collect pollen, including mining bees (\"Andrena\"), which are the most effective pollinators.\n\nThe bitter and toxic leaves and rhizomes are not often eaten by mammalian herbivores.\n\n\"Sanguinaria canadensis\" is cultivated as an ornamental plant. The double-flowered forms are prized by gardeners for their large showy white flowers, which are produced very early in the gardening season. Bloodroot flower petals are shed within a day or two of pollination, so the flower display is short-lived, but the double forms bloom much longer than the normal forms. The double flowers are made up of stamens that have been changed into petal-like parts, making pollination more difficult.\n\nThe double-flowered cultivar \"S. canadensis\" f. \"multiplex\" 'Plena' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nBloodroot produces benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, primarily the toxin sanguinarine. The alkaloids are transported to and stored in the rhizome.\n\nSanguinarine kills animal cells by blocking the action of Na/K-ATPase transmembrane proteins. As a result, applying bloodroot to the skin may destroy tissue and lead to the formation of necrotic tissue, called an eschar. Bloodroot and its extracts are thus considered escharotic. Although applying escharotic agents (including bloodroot) to the skin is sometimes suggested as a home treatment for skin cancer, these attempts can be severely disfiguring. Salves, most notably black salve, derived from bloodroot do not remove tumors. Microscopic tumor deposits may remain after visible tumor tissue is burned away, and case reports have shown that in such instances tumor has recurred and/or metastasized.\n\nInternal use is not recommended. An overdose of bloodroot extract can cause vomiting and loss of consciousness.\n\nComparing the biosynthesis of morphine and sanguinarine, the final intermediate in common is (\"S\")-reticuline. A number of plants in Papaveraceae and Ranunculaceae, as well as plants in the genus \"Colchicum\" (family Colchicaceae) and genus \"Chondodendron\" (family Menispermaceae), also produce such benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Plant geneticists have identified and sequenced genes which produce the enzymes required for this production. One enzyme involved is N-methylcoclaurine 3'-monooxygenase, which produces (\"S\")-3'-hydroxy-\"N\"-methylcoclaurine and mendococlaurine from (\"S\")-\"N\"-methylcoclaurine.\n\nBloodroot was used historically by Native Americans for curative properties as an emetic, respiratory aid, and other treatments.\n\nIn physician William Cook's 1869 work \"The Physiomedical Dispensatory\" is a chapter on the uses and preparations of bloodroot, which described tinctures and extractions, and also included the following cautionary report:\nGreater celandine (\"Chelidonium majus\"), a member of the poppy family, was used in colonial America as a wart remedy. Bloodroot has been similarly applied in the past. This may explain the multiple American and British definitions of \"tetterwort\" .\n\nBloodroot extracts have also been promoted by some supplement companies as a treatment or cure for cancer, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has listed some of these products among its \"187 Fake Cancer 'Cures' Consumers Should Avoid\". Oral use of products containing bloodroot are strongly associated with the development of oral leukoplakia, which is a premalignant lesion that may develop into oral cancer.\n\nThis plant has also been used in medical quackery, as was evidenced by the special product produced by Dr. John Henry Pinkard during the 1920s and 1930s. Some bottles of \"Pinkard's Sanguinaria Compound\", made from bloodroot or bloodwort, were seized by federal officials in 1931. \"Analysis by this department of a sample of the article showed that it consisted essentially of extracts of plant drugs including sanguinaria, sugar, alcohol, and water. It was alleged in the information that the article was misbranded in that certain statements, designs, and devices regarding the therapeutic and curative effects of the article, appearing on the bottle label, falsely and fraudulently represented that it would be effective as a treatment, remedy, and cure for pneumonia, coughs, weak lungs, asthma, kidney, liver, bladder, or any stomach troubles, and effective as a great blood and nerve tonic.\" John Henry Pinkard plead guilty and was fined $25.00.\n\nCommercial uses of sanguinarine and bloodroot extract include dental hygiene products. The United States FDA has approved the inclusion of sanguinarine in toothpastes as an antibacterial or anti-plaque agent. However, the use of sanguinaria in oral hygiene products is associated with the development of a premalignant oral leukoplakia,which may develop into oral cancer. In 2003, the Colgate-Palmolive Company of Piscataway, New Jersey, United States commented by memorandum to the United States Food and Drug Administration that then-proposed rules for levels of sanguinarine in mouthwash and dental wash products were lower than necessary. However, this conclusion is controversial.\n\nSome animal food additives sold and distributed in Europe contain sanguinarine and chelerythrine.\n\nBloodroot is a popular red natural dye used by Native American artists, especially among southeastern rivercane basketmakers. A break in the surface of the plant, especially the roots, reveals a reddish sap which can be used as a dye.\n\n\n"}

The school was established in 1894 and named for Frances Ridley Havergal, a composer, author, and humanitarian.\n\nToday, the campus is located at 1451 Avenue Road, at the corner of Avenue Road and Lawrence Avenue in midtown Toronto. Facilities include an Upper School, an athletic centre with a pool and fitness center, music studios, a theatre, computer labs, and a Junior School.\n\nIn 2012, Havergal's elementary school was ranked first by the Fraser Institute amongst Toronto schools, receiving a \"perfect score of 10.\" In 2015, Havergal's secondary school was ranked second by the Fraser Institute amongst 749 Ontario secondary schools.\n\nHavergal was founded in 1894 as a Church of England Ladies' College, under principal Ellen Mary Knox. She held a first-class in the final honour examination at the University of Oxford, a Cambridge University diploma in teaching, and a First Division Government certificate. Havergal was the sister school of Ridley College for the first several decades of the schools' history.\n\nIn 1898, a new building was constructed for the school at 354 Jarvis Street. By 1903, Havergal College had 120 boarders and 200 day girls, a staff of 20 resident teachers (chiefly from English universities) and a number of nonresident visiting teachers. The former Havergal Ladies' College building at 354 Jarvis Street is now the Margaret McCain Academic Building at the National Ballet School of Canada.\nHavergal has several symbols. The Havergal Crest, comprising maple leaves, laurel branches, a torch, and a lamp of learning, symbolizes the school motto of \"Vitai Lampada Tradens\" — passing on the torch of life. The marguerite was chosen as the school flower \"because it grew so cheerily wherever its luck found it, and because it looked up so steadily at the light that its heart was pierced with purest gold, its petals the purest white.\" (First Principal Ellen Knox)\n\nThe Upper School refers to both the Middle School and the Senior School (together, grades 7 to 12) and is located at 1451 Avenue Road. The building was completed in 1926.\n\nThe Liberal Arts program exceeds the expectations of the Ontario Ministry of Education. All courses are college-preparatory and are at the advanced level. A credit is granted with the successful completion of a course for which a minimum of 110 hours has been scheduled. Many students choose to write Advanced Placement exams. Upon graduation, students receive the Ontario Secondary School Diploma.\n\nThe Languages Department at Havergal offers courses in French, Spanish, Latin, and Mandarin.\n\nStudents learn the fundamentals of web design, video and multimedia production, animation, and graphic design. Courses provide the opportunity to explore current industry-standard software, including PhotoShop, InDesign, GoLive, Final Cut Pro, DVD Studio Pro, Soundtrack, LiveType, Motion, Dreamweaver, Flash, and Microsoft Office.\n\nThe Advanced Placement (AP) Program gives students exposure to university-level material and, in some cases, credit towards university courses, and helps students acquire the skills and habits they will need for success at university. Havergal offers Advanced Placement courses in biology, calculus, statistics, French, and Spanish.\n\nThe boarding school is a residence for approximately 50 students (Grades 9 to 12), representing countries all over the globe. Fully integrated in the life of the school and with Day Students, boarding students participate in life skills programming, recreational programming and The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, in addition to the curricular and co-curricular programs. The Boarding School also hosts exchange students who visit for several weeks each term from partner schools located in six countries worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe house system forms the basis for organization in the school. The Houses have been named for women who have contributed to the welfare of Havergal. \n\nThe House tradition is a characteristic of the Havergal community is part of the history of the school. The House system recognizes the contributions of ten women within the life of the school, it also provides an important link between students and Old Girls throughout the generations.\n\n\n"}

BidPay was rebranded as \"Western Union Auction Payments\" in 2003 which led to confusion with Western Union's wire transfer services; the online auction payment service reverted to the BidPay name in 2004. BidPay ceased operations on 31 December 2005 and was purchased for US$1.8 million in March 2006 by CyberSource Corporation, which announced its intention to relaunch BidPay. BidPay had over 4 million registered users worldwide at that time.\n\nBidPay was a popular payment method for auction sellers based in North America because there was no chargeback or reversal risk, as there was with competing services such as PayPal. The buyer of an item or service was responsible for all fees, and US sellers had the option of receiving an ACH payment direct into their bank account. However, when a buyer successfully made a chargeback in a disputed transaction, BidPay ended up taking the loss rather than the seller.\n\nBidPay was relaunched in June 2006 based on an operating model similar to that of a merchant account for auction sales. Sellers were now responsible for all fees and had to have a US-based bank account that accepted ACH payments since money orders were no longer issued. Before approving payment, Bidpay reviewed payments via automated fraud checks. Also, sellers had to ship by a track and trace shipper. Bidpay would assume the risk of chargebacks if the seller followed all the requirements under the user agreement.\n\nBidPay.com, Inc. finally discontinued operations on December 31, 2007.\n\n\n"}

Often erroneously credited as a founder of the group, Sister Boom Boom actually joined the Sisters in 1980, several months after its founding. She left the order in the Spring of 1986. Her full name was Sister Rose of the Bloody Stains of the Sacred Robes of Jesus, which would trail into a sing-song cadence and a long fermata. This called for a short nickname.\n\nIn 1982, Sister Boom Boom ran for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors with agitprop campaigning tactics bringing humor and raising issues she felt were being ignored in the race. She won 23,124 votes with her occupation listed as \"Nun of the Above\". Five supervisors were elected; she placed eighth.

The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave in the southeastern Caribbean Sea on August 29. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. On September 1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane on September 2. Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then British Honduras) late on September 3. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day.\n\nDuring its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage. In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane struck after the undeclared Football War, causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country. Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore Bay Islands, and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there. In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. Several rivers in the region flooded, with the Belize River reaching above normal. Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops. Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala, until Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Overall damage was estimated at $35.6 million, and there were 271 deaths.\n\nThe origins of Hurricane Francelia were from a tropical wave – an elongated low pressure area – that exited the western coast of Africa on August 19. It moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and the annual summary of 1969 tropical cyclone activity indicated there may have been a tropical depression – a cyclone with sustained winds of less 40 mph (75 km/h) – briefly located within the system. On August 26, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed along the wave, about 800 miles (1300 km) east of Barbados. A Hurricane Hunters flight two days later reported no low-level circulation. As the system moved through the southern Lesser Antilles, ship and land observations suggested a circulation had developed, signalling the formation of a tropical depression in the extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea early on August 29.\n\nThe new tropical cyclone moved quickly west-northwestward away from South America, and on August 30 reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Based on the observation, the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Francelia. Strengthening continued to near hurricane-force, but the fast-moving circulation outran the convection, causing brief weakening as it passed south of Jamaica. Although initially forecast to continue to the west-northwest, Francelia slowed and turned to the west-southwest on September 1 due to a ridge to its north. Concurrently, the storm intensified into hurricane status after its winds reached 75 mph (120 km/h), and late on September 1 Francelia passed over Swan Island. During its passage, an atmospheric sounding occurred in its eye; a sounding is a measurement of the physical properties of the atmosphere, and the process had only occurred four times previously.\n\nHurricane Francelia continued west-southwestward toward the northern coast of Central America, strengthening significantly despite its proximity to land. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September 2 reported winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum pressure of as the hurricane crossed over the Bay Islands, only 30 miles (50 km) off the coast of Honduras. Francelia weakened slightly as its forward movement slowed, but it remained a hurricane as it approached land, based on confirmation from ship reports. Late on September 3, the hurricane made landfall with winds estimated at 110 mph (180 km/h), just north of Punta Gorda in southern Belize, then known as British Honduras. Tropical storm force winds spread across the country, although hurricane-force winds occurred only in a small area near where the hurricane made landfall. Francelia weakened quickly over land, dissipating late on September 4 over Guatemala. The system continued slowly across Central America, crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean three days after it moved ashore. On September 8, the remnants of Francelia redeveloped into Tropical Storm Glenda off the coast of Mexico, which moved parallel to the southwest Mexican coast before dissipating on September 12.\n\nAs a developing tropical cyclone, Francelia brought gusty winds to several islands across the eastern Caribbean. A few days later, it passed south of Jamaica, and winds of around 30 mph (50 km/h) were recorded, and there was heavy rainfall. Shortly thereafter, the eye of Francelia crossed over Grand Cayman, producing in a 16‑hour period. On Swan Island, located about 90 miles (145 km) offshore Honduras, Francelia produced peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). A station on the island recorded a minimum pressure of , as well as of rainfall during the storm's passage.\n\nBefore Francelia made its final landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued warnings for countries in the western Caribbean, although there were few observations confirming the track while it was active due to inadequate regional weather stations and lack of the Hurricane Hunters close to land. When Francelia nearly stalled off the coast of Central America, it brought prolonged rainfall and extensive flooding. In Guatemala, daily rainfall reached 7.27 in (184.6 mm) at a station along the Achiguate River, and totals reached about in some mountainous areas. Along the Belizean coast, the hurricane produced a storm tide of about . Mountain rainfall resulted in overflown rivers, with the Belize River rising to over above normal. The hurricane forced over 20,000 people to evacuate their homes.\n\nOffshore northern Honduras, the Bay Islands experienced heavy rainfall and high tides from the hurricane. Most of the houses in French Harbor were damaged or destroyed, leaving 400 families homeless. About half of the town of Coxen Hole on Roatán was destroyed, and the rest of the buildings were damaged. Damage was less severe on Útila and Guanaja islands. Francelia flooded most of the northern coast of Honduras, inundating the airport in San Pedro Sula to a depth of . In San Pedro Sula, the storm cut the water supply for several days, and the floods cut road and rail links between there and Puerto Cortés along the coast. Across the region, Francelia caused widespread power outages. Along the Ulúa River, several residents were stranded when their cars stalled in flooded roadways. The floods wrecked four bridges on a road between La Lima and Tela. Flooding also ruined over 50% of the United Fruit Company's banana crop, forcing over to be replaced. Banana damage totaled $4.7 million, and United Fruit estimated it would take two years to reach production levels before the hurricane. Other damaged crops included corn, sugar, coconut, and bean. Nationwide, the hurricane destroyed about 1,000 houses, leaving 5,000 people homeless. Damage was estimated at $19 million.\n\nIn neighboring Guatemala, Francelia caused flash flooding along the Pacific coast due to the heavy rainfall. The rains overflowed rivers, canals, and the crater lake of Volcán de Agua, causing widespread landslides. The floods and landslides wrecked highways, rail lines, and many boats, leaving several towns isolated. A portion of the Pan-American Highway was washed out in the country's western portion, and another bridge was destroyed by a landslide between Quetzaltenango and Huehuetenango; landslides also forced the closure of two roads in Quiché Department. In Amatitlán, the floods covered the entire town with mud to shoulder-height. Five entire towns were largely destroyed, leaving 10,200 people homeless nationwide. Francelia destroyed 1,704 houses, mostly along rivers and in landslide zones. The floods also damaged power lines and crops. Throughout the country, the hurricane killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage.\n\nFrancelia's rainfall extended into El Salvador, where about 1,000 homes were flooded along the Lempa River. Isolated residents along the Paz River required food to be airdropped. The floods damaged corn and sorghum crops, and some livestock were killed. Francelia destroyed 42 houses in El Salvador, destroyed a bridge, and caused $1.6 million in damage. The hurricane killed two people and injured 40 others. Heavy damage also occurred along the Belize coast, and communications were cut. The storm caused extensive damage to crops, including heavy losses to the banana industry. High waves and heavy rainfall caused power outages and flooded coastal roadways.\n\nBy September 5, or two days after the hurricane's landfall, floods were receding across Honduras, and flights were restored to the Bay Islands. Floods receded a day later in Guatemala and not until September 9 in El Salvador.\n\nShortly after Francelia struck the Bay Islands, the Honduran health ministry flew a doctor and nurse with medical supplies to the islands. Undamaged boats were used to transport people and supplies to the islands, utilizing relief goods intended for the recovery after a war earlier in 1969. In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods with the assistance of the United States, installing two Bailey bridges that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent unsettled weather. The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and C-rations. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10 tons of medicine from Brazil, 500 blankets from Chile, and 200 bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.\n\n"}

Smith was the third Miss USA of African-American origin, after Carole Gist (1990) and Kenya Moore (1993), in addition to being the sixth American woman to win Miss Universe and the first since Shawn Weatherly was crowned Miss Universe 1980. She was the first, and only, African-American Miss Universe.\n\nSmith was born in Redwood City, California, to 19-year-old parents Craig Smith, an African-American maintenance man, and Mary Denise Trimble, a white American secretary. Her parents divorced before she was two, and her mother, an alcoholic at the time, granted Smith's maternal grandparents Barnie and Jeanette custody of her.\n\nWhen Smith was seven, she moved with her grandparents to Kingwood, Texas, where they would later get divorced as well, causing Smith to grow up in a divided home while she attended high school in Deer Park.

I believe very strongly in who I am, and I've seen 50 ladies tonight who believe very strongly in who they are, and I really think that she wouldn't have made it as far as she has if she wouldn't have been herself, so I really truly think she should stay exactly the way she is.\" She became the seventh woman from her state to hold the Miss USA title and also won the Miss Congeniality award as she had at her state pageant, becoming the only Miss USA winner and Miss Texas USA in history to win this award.\n\nAfter her crowning, Smith was a celebrity contestant on \"Wheel of Fortune\" and an award presenter at the People's Choice Awards.\n\nAfter becoming Miss USA, Smith traveled to Windhoek, Namibia, to compete in the 1995 Miss Universe pageant, broadcast live from Windhoek Country Club on May 12, 1995. She was again the highest placed contestant after the preliminary competition, which propelled her into the top ten. Once again, Smith was among the final 3 contestants and went on to win the title ahead of first runner-up Manpreet Brar of India, becoming the first Miss USA and sixth representative to capture the Miss Universe crown in 15 years./\n\nAs a model, Smith worked for Hawaiian Tropic, Jantzen, Pontiac, Venus Swimwear, and Pure Protein among others. She made appearances on \"Martin\", \"Due South\" and the TLC documentary \"The History of the Bathing Suit\".\n\nWith the support of Music World Entertainment/Sony, Smith co-wrote and recorded with producer Damon Elliott her first single, \"Dom Da Da\", part of the soundtrack for \"The Sweetest Thing\", starring Cameron Diaz. In 2003, she acted in the independent film \"Playas Ball\", where she co-starred with Allen Payne and Elise Neal. She also co-hosted Beyoncé Knowles' special \"Beyonce: Family and Friends Tour\" on pay-per-view and appeared on HBO in Saladin Patterson's short film \"One Flight Stand\" with Marc Blucas and Aisha Tyler. She was a judge at the 2006 Miss Teen USA pageant. and was a guest judge for the Miss Peru 2016 beauty pageant.\n\nIn 2011, she was presented the Influential Multiracial Public Figure award.\n\nSmith married fitness coach Kelly Blair after her reign as Miss Universe and moved to Los Angeles. They later divorced.\n\nSmith was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2017. Growing increasingly weak throughout 2018, she traveled to her mother's home in Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and she died there at the age of 45 on September 8, 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866009", "title": "Environmentalism", "text": "Environmentalism\n\nEnvironmentalism or environmental rights is a broad philosophy, ideology, and social movement regarding concerns for environmental protection and improvement of the health of the environment, particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the impact of changes to the environment on humans, animals, plants and non-living matter. While environmentalism focuses more on the environmental and nature-related aspects of green ideology and politics, ecology combines the ideology of social ecology and environmentalism.\n\nEnvironmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and improvement of the natural environment and critical earth system elements or processes such as the climate, and may be referred to as a movement to control pollution or protect plant and animal diversity. For this reason, concepts such as a land ethic, environmental ethics, biodiversity, ecology, and the biophilia hypothesis figure predominantly.\n\nAt its crux, environmentalism is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend in such a way that all the components are accorded a proper degree of sustainability. The exact measures and outcomes of this balance is controversial and there are many different ways for environmental concerns to be expressed in practice. Environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the colour green, but this association has been appropriated by the marketing industries for the tactic known as greenwashing.\n\nEnvironmentalism is opposed by anti-environmentalism, which says that the Earth is less fragile than some environmentalists maintain, and portrays environmentalism as overreacting to the human contribution to climate change or opposing human advancement.\n\n\"Environmentalism\" denotes a social movement that seeks to influence the political process by lobbying, activism, and education in order to protect natural resources and ecosystems.\n\nAn \"environmentalist\" is a person who may speak out about our natural environment and the sustainable management of its resources through changes in public policy or individual behaviour. This may include supporting practices such as informed consumption, conservation initiatives, investment in renewable resources, improved efficiencies in the materials economy, transitioning to new accounting paradigms such as Ecological economics, renewing and revitalizing our connections with non-human life or even opting to have one less child to reduce consumption and pressure on resources.\n\nIn various ways (for example, grassroots activism and protests), environmentalists and environmental organisations seek to give the natural world a stronger voice in human affairs.\n\nIn general terms, environmentalists advocate the sustainable management of resources, and the protection (and restoration, when necessary) of the natural environment through changes in public policy and individual behaviour. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in ecosystems, the movement is centered around ecology, health, and human rights.\n\nA concern for environmental protection has recurred in diverse forms, in different parts of the world, throughout history.\nThe earliest ideas of environment protectionism can be traced in Jainism, which was revived by Mahavira in 6th century BC in ancient India. Jainism offers a view that may seem readily compatible with core values associated with environmental activism, i.e., protection of life by nonviolence; which could form the basis of strong ecological ethos thus adding its voice to global calls for protection of environment. His teachings on the symbiosis between all living beings and the five elements—earth, water, air, fire, and space—form the basis of environmental sciences today.\n\nIn Europe, King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem. The fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.\n\nEarlier in the Middle East, the Caliph Abu Bakr in the 630s commanded his army to \"Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire,\" and \"Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food.\" Arabic medical treatises during the 9th to 13th centuries dealing with environmentalism and environmental science, including pollution, were written by Al-Kindi, Qusta ibn Luqa, Al-Razi, Ibn Al-Jazzar, al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Avicenna, Ali ibn Ridwan, Ibn Jumay, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Abd-el-latif, Ibn al-Quff, and Ibn al-Nafis. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution, such as air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, municipal solid waste mishandling, and environmental impact assessments of certain localities.\n\nThe origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's Alkali Acts, passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution (gaseous hydrochloric acid) given off by the Leblanc process, used to produce soda ash. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted smoke, grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\n\nIn industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms. Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The Coal Smoke Abatement Society was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.\n\nDuring the Spanish Revolution, anarchist-controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms, which were possibly the largest in the world at the time. Daniel Guerin notes that anarchist territories would diversify crops, extend irrigation, initiate reforestation, start tree nurseries and help to establish naturist communities. Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the CNT shut down several metal factories.\n\nIt was only under the impetus of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths, that the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed and airborne pollution in the city was first tackled. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism, and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people's quality of life.\n\nThe late 19th century also saw the passage of the first wildlife conservation laws.\nThe zoologist Alfred Newton published a series of investigations into the \"Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals\" between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and influenced the passage of the Sea Birds Preservation Act in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.\n\nEarly interest in the environment was a feature of the Romantic movement in the early 19th century. One of the earliest modern pronouncements on thinking about human industrial advancement and its influence on the environment was written by Japanese geographer, educator, philosopher and author Tsunesaburo Makiguchi in his 1903 publication \"Jinsei Chirigaku\" (\"A Geography of Human Life\"). In Britain the poet William Wordsworth travelled extensively in the Lake District and wrote that it is a \"sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\".\nSystematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to industrialisation, the growth of cities, and worsening air and water pollution. Starting with the formation of the Commons Preservation Society in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. Robert Hunter, solicitor for the society, worked with Hardwicke Rawnsley, Octavia Hill, and John Ruskin to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of Newlands and Ennerdale. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).\n\nPeter Kropotkin wrote about ecology in economics, agricultural science, conservation, ethology, criminology, urban planning, geography, geology and biology. He observed in Swiss and Siberian glaciers that they had been slowly melting since the dawn of the industrial revolution, possibly making him one of the first predictors for climate change. He also observed the damage done from deforestation and hunting. Kropotkin's writings would become influential in the 1970s and became a major inspiration for the intentional community movement as well as his ideas becoming the basis for the theory of social ecology.\n\nIn 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the \"National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\" was formally inaugurated in 1894. The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation. and the bill was passed in August 1907.\n\nAn early \"Back-to-Nature\" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as John Ruskin, William Morris, George Bernard Shaw and Edward Carpenter, who were all against consumerism, pollution and other activities that were harmful to the natural world. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical utopia and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a \"small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.\"\n\nPractical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the \"taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality\", were enthusiastically revived, including the Morris dance and the maypole.\n\nThese ideas also inspired various environmental groups in the UK, such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, established in 1889 by Emily Williamson as a protest group to campaign for greater protection for the indigenous birds of the island. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. By 1900, public support for the organisation had grown, and it had over 25,000 members. The Garden city movement incorporated many environmental concerns into its urban planning manifesto; the Socialist League and The Clarion movement also began to advocate measures of nature conservation.\nThe movement in the United States began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book \"Walden\", which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in Yosemite Valley and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form Yosemite National Park and went on to set up the Sierra Club in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.\n\nIn the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the American bison. The death of the last passenger pigeon as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and to popularise their concerns. In 1916, the National Park Service was founded by US President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nThe Forestry Commission was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for afforestation and reforestation. The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade. During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. By 1939 the Forestry Commission was the largest landowner in Britain.\nDuring the 1930s the Nazis had elements that were supportive of animal rights, zoos and wildlife, and took several measures to ensure their protection. In 1933 the government created a stringent animal-protection law and in 1934, \"Das Reichsjagdgesetz\" (The Reich Hunting Law) was enacted which limited hunting. Several Nazis were environmentalists (notably Rudolf Hess), and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the regime. In 1935, the regime enacted the \"Reich Nature Protection Act\" (\"Reichsnaturschutzgesetz\"). The concept of the \"Dauerwald\" (best translated as the \"perpetual forest\") which included concepts such as forest management and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb air pollution.\n\nIn 1949, \"A Sand County Almanac\" by Aldo Leopold was published. It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organisations. David Brower, Ansel Adams and Nancy Newhall created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. \"This Is Dinosaur\" edited by Wallace Stegner with photographs by Martin Litton and Philip Hyde prevented the building of dams within Dinosaur National Monument by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of Yosemite National Park, when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanised public opposition to building dams in the Grand Canyon and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the Wilderness Society and many others.\n\nAfter a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the exploitation of natural resources.\n\nIn 1962, \"Silent Spring\" by American biologist Rachel Carson was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of DDT in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. The resulting public concern led to the creation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in disease vector control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth (US), as well as notable local organisations such as the Wyoming Outdoor Council, which was founded in 1967.\n\nIn the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the counterculture movement.\n\nThe world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the United Tasmania Group Tasmania, Australia and the Values Party of New Zealand. The first green party in Europe was the Popular Movement for the Environment, founded in 1972 in the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel. The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the Ecology Party, and then the Green Party.\n\nProtection of the environment also became important in the developing world; the Chipko movement was formed in India under the influence of Mhatmas Gandhi and they set up peaceful resistance to deforestation by literally hugging trees (leading to the term \"tree huggers\"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan \"ecology is permanent economy\" were very influential.\n\nAnother milestone in the movement was the creation of Earth Day. Earth Day was first observed in San Francisco and other cities on 21 March 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On 21 March 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a spaceship Earth on Earth Day, hereby referring to the ecosystem services the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and is celebrated in more than 192 countries every year.\n\nThe UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on 5–16 June 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The Back-to-the-land movement started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with anti-Vietnam War sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as deep ecology. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 and the formation of CITES in 1975. Significant amendments were also enacted to the United States Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.\n\nIn 1979, James Lovelock, a British scientist, published \"Gaia: A new look at life on Earth\", which put forth the Gaia hypothesis; it proposes that life on earth can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the Deep Green ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists.\n\nEnvironmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as global warming, overpopulation, genetic engineering, and plastic pollution.\n\nResearch demonstrates a precipitous decline in the US public's interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern. Americans are less likely be actively participating in an environmental movement or organisation and more likely to identify as \"unsympathetic\" to an environmental movement than in 2000. This is likely a lingering factor of the Great Recession in 2008. Since 2005, the percentage of Americans agreeing that the environment should be given priority over economic growth has dropped 10 points, in contrast, those feeling that growth should be given priority \"even if the environment suffers to some extent\" has risen 12 percent. Never-the-less, a recent National Geographic survey indicated strong desire for commitment across a dozen countries, indicating a majority were in favour of more than half of the Earth's land surface protected. \n\nTree sitting is a form of activism in which the protester sits in a tree in an attempt to stop the removal of a tree or to impede the demolition of an area with the longest and most famous tree-sitter being Julia Butterfly Hill, who spent 738 days in a California Redwood, saving a three-acre tract of forest.\n\nSit-in can be used to encourage social change, such as the Greensboro sit-ins, a series of protests in 1960 to stop racial segregation, but can also be used in ecoactivism, as in the Dakota Access Pipeline Protest.\n\nBefore the Syrian Civil War, Rojava had been ecologically damaged by monoculture, oil extraction, damming of rivers, deforestation, drought, topsoil loss and general pollution. The DFNS launched a campaign titled 'Make Rojava Green Again' (a parody of Make America Great Again) which is attempting to provide renewable energy to communities (especially solar energy), reforestation, protecting water sources, planting gardens, promoting urban agriculture, creating wildlife reserves, water recycling, beekeeping, expanding public transportation and promoting environmental awareness within their communities.\n\nThe Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities are firmly environmentalist and have stopped the extraction of oil, uranium, timber and metal from the Lacandon Jungle and stopped the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers in farming.\n\nThe CIPO-RFM has engaged in sabotage and direct action against wind farms, shrimp farms, eucalyptus plantations and the timber industry. They have also set up corn and coffee worker cooperatives and built schools and hospitals to help the local populations. They have also created a network of autonomous community radio stations to educate people about dangers to the environment and inform the surrounding communities about new industrial projects that would destroy more land. In 2001, the CIPO-RFM defeated the construction of a highway that was part of Plan Puebla Panama.\n\nThe \"environmental movement\" (a term that sometimes includes the conservation and green movements) is a diverse scientific, social, and political movement. Though the movement is represented by a range of organisations, because of the inclusion of environmentalism in the classroom curriculum, the environmental movement has a younger demographic than is common in other social movements (see green seniors).\n\nEnvironmentalism as a movement covers broad areas of institutional oppression, including for example: consumption of ecosystems and natural resources into waste, dumping waste into disadvantaged communities, air pollution, water pollution, weak infrastructure, exposure of organic life to toxins, mono-culture, anti-polythene drive (jhola movement) and various other focuses. Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: environmental science, environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and environmental justice.\n\nFree market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the free market, property rights, and tort law provide the best tools to preserve the health and sustainability of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and class action.\n\nEvangelical environmentalism is an environmental movement in the United States of America in which some Evangelicals have emphasized biblical mandates concerning humanity's role as steward and subsequent responsibility for the care taking of Creation. While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded theological perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion.\n\nEnvironmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation. Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources.\n\nEnvironmental organisations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private (NGO). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.\n\nSome US environmental organisations, among them the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, specialise in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based National Wildlife Federation, Earth Day, National Cleanup Day, the Nature Conservancy, and The Wilderness Society, and global groups like the World Wide Fund for Nature and Friends of the Earth, disseminate information, participate in public hearings, lobby, stage demonstrations, and may purchase land for preservation. Statewide nonprofit organisations such as the Wyoming Outdoor Council often collaborate with these national organisations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including Wildlife Conservation International, conduct research on endangered species and ecosystems. More radical organisations, such as Greenpeace, Earth First!, and the Earth Liberation Front, have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground \"Earth Liberation Front\" engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.\n\nOn an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and the follow-up United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. Other international organisations in support of environmental policies development include the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (as part of NAFTA), the European Environment Agency (EEA), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nNotable environmental protests and campaigns include:\nNotable advocates for environmental protection and sustainability include:\n\nEvery year, more than 100 environmental activists are murdered throughout the world. Most recent deaths are in Brazil, where activists combat logging in the Amazon rainforest.\n\n116 environmental activists were assassinated in 2014, and 185 in 2015. This represents more than two environmentalists assassinated every week in 2014 and three every week in 2015. More than 200 environmental activists were assassinated worldwide between 2016 and early 2018. A 2020 incident saw several rangers murdered in the Congo Rainforest by poaching squads. Occurrences like this are relatively common, and account for a large number of deaths.\n\n\nMany environmentalists believe that human interference with 'nature' should be restricted or minimised as a matter of urgency (for the sake of life, or the planet, or just for the benefit of the human species), whereas environmental skeptics and anti-environmentalists do not believe that there is such a need. One can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human 'interference' with 'nature' should be \"increased\". Nevertheless, there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature, leading to less concern with environment preservation. Increasingly, typical conservation rhetoric is being replaced with restoration approaches and larger landscape initiatives that seek to create more holistic impacts.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866015", "title": "Hurricane Ginny", "text": "Hurricane Ginny\n\nHurricane Ginny was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Canada, as well as the latest hurricane on a calendar year to affect the U.S. state of Maine. The eighth tropical storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginny developed on October 16 over the Bahamas, although it was not initially a fully tropical cyclone. As it moved to the North and later northwest, Ginny intensified to hurricane status as it became more tropical. For eight days, it was located within of the United States coastline. After approaching North Carolina, Ginny looped to the southwest and approached within of the Florida coastline. It turned to the North, to the East, and later to the northeast, strengthening late in its duration to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Ginny became an extratropical cyclone shortly after striking Nova Scotia at its peak intensity on October 29.\n\nAlthough it remained close to the United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.\n\nThe origins of Hurricane Ginny were from a trough that extended from the Bahamas to Bermuda in the middle of October. On October 16, a depression formed near the Turks and Caicos islands after a tropical wave interacted with the trough, although initially it was not tropical in nature due to the widespread presence of cold air. The system initially moved generally northward, attaining gale–force winds on October 19 as it turned to the northwest. For several days, Ginny maintained a hybrid-type structure, and although it attained winds of on October 20, it was not a true hurricane. It closely approached the North Carolina coastline, passing 135 mi (220 km) southeast of Cape Lookout before turning abruptly to the northeast. It executed a small loop and began a steady motion to the southeast while located over the Gulf Stream. This motion was due to a large ridge located over New England. On October 21, the hurricane became better organized and began transitioning into a tropical cyclone. By early on October 22, Hurricane Hunters indicated that Ginny completed the transition into a fully tropical cyclone, observing an eye 20 mi (32 km) in diameter.\n\nOn October 23, Ginny briefly weakened to tropical storm status as it was moving toward Florida, although within 10 hours it regained hurricane intensity. Its motion to the southwest was unusual but not unique, and resembled the tracks of the 1935 Yankee hurricane and Hurricane Able in 1951. On October 24, it turned sharply northeastward off the northeast Florida coast, coming within of Daytona Beach. The hurricane continued paralleling the coast of the Southeastern United States, turning northeast away from Georgia and South Carolina. On October 26, Ginny turned to the east away from the United States, having been located within of the country's coast for eight consecutive days. The next day, the hurricane began a motion to the northeast, accelerating in advance of an approaching trough. It gradually intensified, reaching peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) on October 29. Later that day, Ginny made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia at its peak strength, making it the strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit Atlantic Canada. Ginny became extratropical shortly thereafter, and its remnants dissipated on October 30 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nEarly in its duration, the precursor to Ginny dropped high amounts of rainfall. Monción in the Dominican Republic reported , and Green Turtle Cay in the Bahamas reported .\n\nDespite Ginny's proximity to the United States for over a week, a hurricane warning was only issued from Charleston, South Carolina, and Cape Fear, North Carolina, as well as Cape Hatteras. This represented about one-sixth of the entire coastline that was threatened by the storm. In Jacksonville, Florida, Ginny produced winds of . Rainfall in the state peaked at at Saint Augustine. Tides in Daytona Beach were above normal, which caused beach erosion and minor property damage. Further north, minor damage and beach erosion was likewise reported in Georgia. Along the South Carolina coast, Ginny dropped beneficial rainfall, which alleviated the state's worst drought conditions on record. The rainfall peaked at in Isle of Pines.\n\nThe hurricane approached North Carolina twice. During the second time, residents in low-lying areas and along the coast evacuated. As it passed the area, Ginny produced sustained winds that were estimated at on Cape Fear, with gusts to 100 mph (160 km/h). These were the highest winds related to the hurricane, although they may have been overestimated. In addition, the heaviest rainfall related to the storm occurred near Southport, where of precipitation fell. Tides along the coast were above normal, which caused minor flooding and destroyed one house in Carolina Beach. In Virginia, the hurricane caused minor flooding and minimal beach erosion. During Ginny's first approach through the region, it produced gale-force winds along the Virginia coast, although it did not do so during its second approach.\n\nLater, a gale warning was issued for New England due to Ginny's threat, as well as a hurricane watch for Long Island and southern New England. Across the region, the strongest winds on land were along Nantucket, where a gust of was also reported. However, a boat offshore Portland, Maine reported seas and winds of at least . In New York City, the outskirts of the storm dropped of precipitation, and tides were above normal. Rainfall in eastern New England surpassed , peaking at in Machias, Maine. The rainfall was beneficial across the region, ending a 28-day drought. Along Cape Cod and in Maine, high winds from the storm downed several trees, some of which fell onto power lines. About 1,000 homes in Chatham, Massachusetts lost power. In Nantucket, high waves caused additional erosion in an area affected by Hurricane Esther two years prior. Damage was heavier in Maine, where many boats were damaged or broke from their moorings. One person died from a heart attack while trying to rescue his boat. Several small buildings in the state were destroyed, and the post office in Calais, Maine lost its roof. Ginny was the latest hurricane on record to affect Maine. During its passage, Ginny brought an influx of cold air over New England that produced the first snowfall of the season across Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire. In most locations, the snow quickly melted, although higher totals occurred in northern Maine, the highest being on Mount Katahdin. The snow killed a mountain climber and a park ranger. Damage from Ginny in the United States was estimated at $400,000.\n\nAs the remnants of Ginny moved across Atlantic Canada, they produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 4.53 in (113 mm) in southern New Brunswick. Winds peaked at 99 mph (160 km/h) in Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The winds blew down trees in the Halifax area, and there were power outages reported there and in Antigonish. High waves broke boats from their moorings, causing them to either wash ashore or float out to sea. Ferry service across the region was canceled. In neighboring New Brunswick, the storm caused outages to telephone and electric services. Several injuries were reported, although there were no fatalities. The entirety of Prince Edward Island was also left without power.\n\n"}

The \"comune\" (municipality) of San Fele is part of the Comunità montana del Vulture which makes it a gateway to the Vulture section of the province of Potenza in the state of Baslicata, Italy, which is famous for its excellent and economical \"aglianico\" wines. San Fele is also the trailhead for hikes to lovely waterfalls. The comune/municipality of San Fele includes the towns of Atella, Bella, Castelgrande, Filiano, Muro Lucano, Rapone and Ruvo del Monte. San Fele also includes the hamlets of Agrifoglio, Armatieri, Cecci, Cerrito, Difesa, Montagna, Pierno, Priore, Masone, Signorella. It is also a short drive from Melfi and Melfi Castle. San Fele is about thirty-five miles east of Salerno, and is about a two hour drive from Naples or four hours from Rome.\n\nInhabited since ancient times by woodsmen and called Lucania by the ancient Greeks and Romans, the actual city of San Fele originated in 969, with the construction of an octagonal fortified castle on what is now called Monte Castello, commissioned by Otto I of Saxony to repel potential attacks by the Byzantines who ruled Southern Italy at the time. The area was seen as strategically important because the Crocelle Pass, the southern passage through the Apennine Mountains lies in the northeast corner of the Comune (municipality) of San Fele. From ancient times this Pass functioned as a major trade route between Salerno in the West and Bari in the East, both major trading ports. The route was also a major pathway for Crusaders and Pilgrams to the \"Holy Land\".\n\nSan Fele was named by the workers who built the fortress, and were from Venosa, an ancient Roman city also in Basilicata. They dedicated the fortress to their protector-saint, Saint Felix (San Felice), which has been shortened to Fele.\n\nIn the aftermath of the unification of Italy during the 1840s, much of the local population was displaced, and the area was affected by banditry. Famous brigands included Giovanni Fortunato, known as \"Coppa\", Vito Di Gianni, called \"Totaro\" and Francesco Fasanella, called \"Tinna\", who were part of the infamous Carmine Crocco. A television miniseries about these infamous highway bandits, \"\", was made in 2012.\n\nAs a result of this upheaval, and partly due to drought, deforestation and a devastating earthquake, San Fele was part of the large emigration of the late 19th century (to North and South America). A large number emigrated to the United States, including New York City, Buffalo, New York and Newark, New Jersey, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. In addition, after the upheaval of World War II, and particularly in the 1950s and '60s, many San Felese emigrated (to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy). Currently, the population of San Fele is about 3,000 people, down from over 10,000 in the 1870s.\n\nThe primary industry in San Fele is agriculture, and the area features lovely woodlands and hiking trails, and is known for the fertility of its volcanic soil which produces the excellent aglianico wines for which Basilicata is known, as well as mushrooms, truffles, cheese, game, and handmade pastas. Although much of the area was deforested due to a timber boom during the 19th century and to clear land for farming, part of the Comune of San Fele includes a national park with lush forestland dominated by oak, maple, beech and mountain pine. Because San Fele is located at a higher altitude, this is a restful place to escape the heat of summer and to see pristine nature, including San Fele's small and charming waterfalls or \"cascade\".\n\nSan Fele feast days include:\nJanuary 20: Feast of the Patron Saint Sebastian\n1st Sunday of May: Feast of the Madonna di Pierno\n30 July: Feast of San Giustino de Jacobis\n15 August: Feast of the Madonna of Pierno\n8 September: Feast of the Madonna of Pierno\n\nSan Fele hosts the Basilicata International Film Festival in August, and the Feast of Madonna di Pierno, which has been celebrated since 1139 AD, also in August. San Fele is also known as the birthplace of San Giustino de Jacobis (on 9 October 1800), whose home has been restored and is now a destination for pilgrims.\n\nMany descendants of San Felese diaspora have created San Fele Societies, including the San Felese Society of New Jersey, the San Fele Association of Western New York, and San Felesi in Australia.\n\n\n"}

He was the Chief Minister of Penang from 1990 to 2008 and was appointed as a Senator; a member of the Dewan Negara, the upper house of the Malaysian Parliament. In April 2009, Koh was appointed Minister in the Prime Minister's Department by Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak. He was famously known for contributing in \"Sungai Pinang\" campaign where he took almost 10 years and failed to complete it.\n\nHe was the fourth president of Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan), a member of the opposition Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, and also the first President of Gerakan not named a candidate in the Malaysian General Election.\n\nKoh Tsu Koon was born in Penang in 1949 and attended Phor Tay Primary School, Chung Ling High School and Methodist Boys’ School. He graduated from Princeton University in 1970 with a degree in physics, and obtained his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1977 in economics and sociology of education. He was a Fulbright scholar at Stanford University from 1980 to 1981.\n\nKoh taught at University of Science, Malaysia (USM), Penang from 1975 and rose to become Deputy Dean of Education in 1978.\n\nKoh joined Gerakan in 1982. He won a parliamentary seat during the 1982 general election but lost it to Lim Kit Siang in the following 1986 general election. The following year, he was elected Gerakan Youth chairman. Koh was the protégé of then Penang Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu, serving as Lim's political secretary and chief aide from 1986 to 1990.\n\nKoh became a vice-president of Gerakan in 1991 and later deputy president in 2005. On 8 April 2007, following the retirement of long-serving president Lim Keng Yaik, he took over the presidency in an acting capacity. He was formally elected president in 2008.\n\nIn the 1990 general election, Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu lost his state seat. Koh, who was a first-term state assemblyman from Tanjung Bungah, was selected to lead the Barisan Nasional government in Penang, and became the state's third Chief Minister.\n\nKoh served four terms as Chief Minister for a total of 18 years from 1990 to 2008. In the 1995 general election, he was challenged in his state seat by Lim Kit Siang, who unseated the previous Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu in 1990. Koh beat Kit Siang with over 70% of the votes. He stepped down in 2008 to contest the Batu Kawan parliamentary seat during the general election. Koh was said to be pressured into leaving his position as Chief Minister to join federal politics. He eventually lost the parliamentary contest, while the opposition pact led by the Democratic Action Party (DAP) won the state of Penang.\n\nKoh remained visible in the political scene after the election, and even participated in a televised public debate with his successor as Chief Minister, Lim Guan Eng. He remained as Gerakan president, winning the post permanently in October 2008.\n\nKoh returned to public office in April 2009, when he was appointed as a Senator in the Dewan Negara. This paved the way for prime minister Najib Tun Razak to name Koh in his inaugural Cabinet. He was appointed Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, in charge of unity and performance management. Koh was put in charge of Najib's Government Transformation Programme (GTP), which includes monitoring the performance of ministries and six national key result areas (NKRAs) through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nIn August 2011, \"The Malaysian Insider\" reported that the central government of Putrajaya felt that Koh should step down as BN leader in Penang for the coalition to win back the state government in the 13th general elections. It was further said that voters viewed Koh as indecisive and a symbol of the BN leadership which was rejected by voters in 2008. Gerakan leaders reportedly encouraged Koh to leave Penang to contest the Simpang Renggam parliamentary seat, a Gerakan safe seat in Johor.\n\nOn 16 May 2013, \"The Star\" reported that Koh officially resigned as the President of Gerakan. His deputy, Chang Ko Youn, would take over as acting president until the party elections on 26 October 2013. Koh's resignation followed Gerakan Secretary-General Teng Chang Yeow's earlier resignation as Penang Barisan Nasional chairman and Gerakan Secretary-General.\n\n\n"}

Despite being the designated successor of his father Manuel Komnenos, Andronikos' tenure was short due to premature death from unrecorded causes. The major event of his reign was the definitive loss of Sinope to the Seljuk Turks under the regency of Mu‘in al-Din Suleyman, also known as the Pervane, in the summer or fall of 1265. The capture of Sinope by the Turks gave them the best port on the Black Sea, allowing them to create a navy and compete with the Trapezuntines for influence in the Black Sea.\n\nAndronikos was the eldest son of Manuel Komnenos by his first wife, Anna Xylaloe, a Trapezuntine noblewoman. According to the chronicler Michael Panaretos, \"And so, his son by lady Anna Xylaloe, the lord Andronikos II Komnenos, whom Manuel had urged and selected to take the throne, became emperor and reigned for three years. And he died in 1265/1266.\" In his list of the Emperors before Alexios II, Constantine Loukites fails to mention Andronikos. N. Oikonomides speculates that Loukites omitted Andronikos from his list because the Emperor was excluded from the official gallery of Emperors of Trebizond.\n\nLittle more is known of his brief reign. Trebizond continued to flourish as a trading center — two merchants from Marseilles were there in 1263 and 1264 carrying a letter of introduction from Charles of Anjou, Count of Provence.\n\n"}

Lüske encourages the development of younger poker players and has mentored professional players Noah Boeken, David Williams, and Kirill Gerasimov.\n\nLüske's father was a butcher and a boxer, and he named Marcel after his favorite French pugilist, Marcel Cerdan. He grew up in the Netherlands, where he wanted to be a singer, but he ended up at the center of his country's government, The Hague, working for customs. He moved on to working in a nightclub, owning a bar in the Amsterdam marketplace, and opening a card club in Antwerp, Belgium. As a hobby, he and his brothers picked up five-card stud and played in their downtime at the market. Lüske's card skills among the local vendors led them to suggest him to enter a $1,000 buy-in tournament in Prague. As a result of his successful playing, he won over $40,000 and turned professional. He began flying from city to city to play poker, earning himself the nickname \"The Flying Dutchman\".\n\nLüske appeared twice on the \"Late Night Poker\" show and lost to fellow professionals Barny Boatman in Series 4 in 2001 and John Duthie in Series 6 in 2003.\n\nLüske finished in 14th place in the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event and 10th place in the 2004 WSOP Main Event.

Established in 1871, the \"Orient\" is the oldest continuously-published college weekly in the United States. It was named the second best tabloid-sized college weekly at an Associated Collegiate Press conference in March 2007. In its 2014 college rankings, The Princeton Review named it the 15th best college newspaper; Bowdoin is the smallest school and only liberal arts school to make the list. In 2018, the New England Newspaper and Press Association named the Orient the best college newspaper in New England, and the Princeton Review ranked it sixth in the nation.\n\nThe \"Orient\" currently has an on-campus print distribution of approximately 2,000, and mails the paper to several hundred paid subscribers, including alumni, parents and other friends of the College. The paper is published each Friday that classes are in session at the presses of the Brunswick \"Times Record\". It is distributed to the dining halls, the library, the student union and various other College buildings, as well as in a number of businesses and restaurants in downtown Brunswick.\n\nThe Orient began publishing its content on the Web around 2000. Running on a custom content management system, it was redesigned in 2001; 2004, becoming database-driven; 2009, with a visual overhaul; and 2012. The most recent version is a responsive design intended to work better across all devices, including phones and tablets. Web content has always been free. The paper launched online advertisements in 2017.\n\nThe current mission statement, published in every edition, reads: \"\"The Bowdoin Orient\" is a student-run weekly publication dedicated to providing news and information relevant to the College community. Editorially independent of the College and its administrators, the \"Orient\" pursues such content freely and thoroughly, following professional journalistic standards in writing and reporting. The \"Orient\" is committed to serving as an open forum for thoughtful and diverse discussion and debate on issues of interest to the College community.\"\n\n\"The Bowdoin Orient\" was established in 1871 as Bowdoin College's newspaper and literary magazine. Originally issued bi-weekly, it has been a weekly since April 1899. It is considered to be the oldest continuously-published college weekly in the U.S., which means that it has been in publication every academic year that Bowdoin has been in session since it began publishing weekly. (Other college weeklies stopped printing during certain war years.)\n\nIn the beginning, the \"Orient\" was laid out in a smaller magazine format and included literary material such as poems and fiction alongside its news. In 1897, the literary society formed its own publication, \"The Quill\", and the \"Orient\" has since primarily focused on reporting news. In 1921, the \"Orient\" abandoned the magazine format and moved to a larger broadsheet layout to keep up with the trend of the times. Since then, it has variously moved between broadsheet and tabloid sizes and has seen major format updates every decade or two.\n\nIn 1912, The Bowdoin Publishing Company was established as the formal publisher of the \"Orient\", and remained independent of the College for many years, while using college facilities and working with faculty-member advisers. The Bowdoin Publishing Company was a legal, non-profit corporation in the State of Maine for many years, at least from 1968 to 1989, though it was most likely an independent corporation since its inception. In 2002, the college forced the \"Orient\" to close the Bowdoin Publishing Company's off-campus checking account, which represented the final step in the company's dissolution.\n\nThe \"Orient\" building has its own archives, with issues dating back to 1873, but it is missing several periods of time. The Hawthorne-Longfellow Library at Bowdoin College has a nearly complete archive of past \"Orient\" issues, both in print and on microform. Virtually all print issues are available from 1871 to the present in the library's George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives. Bound copies from 1871 to 1921 can be found in the periodicals section of the library. The \"Orient\" is available on microfilm for issues from 1921 to the present. Archives are also available online through the Internet Archive.\n\n"}

Morosuke's eldest daughter Fujiwara no Anshi, empress consort to Emperor Murakami, gave birth to two princes who later became Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'yū, putting Morosuke's lineage in an advantageous position as the maternal relatives of the Emperor.\n\nMorosuke was born the second son of Fujiwara no Tadahira, who controlled the government for many years as sekkan (regent) and \"daijō-daijin\". Around 930 he had an affair with a daughter of Emperor Daigo, Princess Kinshi, and was later permitted to marry her. This was the first time a non-imperial Japanese retainer married an imperial princess — in previous cases where retainers married the daughters of emperors, those daughters had first been divested of their imperial status.

Morosuke argued that as Tadabumi had accepted his orders and set out from the capital, he should still be rewarded. Saneyori stuck to his own position, but public opinion favored Morosuke.\n\nAfter this Morosuke was promoted to \"dainagon\", made a , and bestowed the .\n\nIn 947, Emperor Suzaku abdicated, and Emperor Murakami ascended to the throne. As Saneyori was promoted to \"sadaijin\", Morosuke filled his old position as \"udaijin\" and was granted the . Promotion naturally favored the eldest son and family heir, but Morosuke was considered excellent enough to cause problems for his older brother in spite of this: Morosuke held more real power than even Saneyori. Morosuke had married his eldest daughter Anshi to Murakami while he was still the crown prince. With his enthronement she became a court lady and assisted the emperor often, and when she bore him the future Emperor Reizei Anshi was made \"chūgū\". As the maternal grandfather of the crown prince, Morosuke and his cohorts were able to lead the court by Murakami's side for about ten years.\n\nAfter the death of his wife Princess Kinshi, Morosuke married Princess Gashi, and when she died Princess Yasuko, all of whom were daughters of Emperor Daigo, thus further deepening his ties with the imperial line. Because he had affairs with and then married three different imperial princesses, Morosuke may have been the model for a character in the \"Utsubo Monogatari\", the ultimate lecher, Fujiwara no Kanemasa.\n\nIn 960 Morosuke was laid out by illness, and according to the customs of the day attempted to cut his hair and take the tonsure, but Emperor Murakami sent a messenger to dissuade him. Even so, his sickness worsened, and on May 29 he cut off his hair, only to die two days later on May 31, 960, at the age of 53.\n\nMorosuke never held the position of sekkan in his life, but the successive reigns of his grandchildren Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'yū after Murakami's death put his family in an outstanding position as the emperor's maternal relatives. His eldest son Koretada briefly held power as sekkan, and his other sons Kanemichi, Kaneie, Tamemitsu, and Kinsue also all attained the position of \"daijō-daijin\". In Morosuke's children's generation, his descendants were the legitimate line of the Fujiwara regent family.\n\nMorosuke and his older brother Saneyori, both educated by Fujiwara no Tadahira, each formed their own school of the practices and traditions of the court. Morosuke formed the , and Saneyori the , which were passed down to their respective descendants. Morosuke recorded the practices of his school in a book called the . He was friends with , who was also versed in the ways of the court, and to whom he married his third and fifth daughters. The talented Takaakira flourished with Morosuke's support.\n\nMorosuke was also an excellent poet, leaving behind a collection of his works simply called . In 956 he held a party in his garden, and the \"Ōkagami\" contains an anecdote about his visit to Ki no Tsurayuki to request that the latter write a poem for him. Thirty-six of Morosuke's poems are included in the \"Gosen Wakashū\".\n\nHis personal diary and the dying instructions he left for his descendants, , are also preserved.\n\n\nMorosuke managed to marry his daughters to Emperor Murakami; the sons of his daughter Empress \"Anshi\"/Yasuko became Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'yū. The reigns of Reizei and En'yū are remarkable for quarrels among the members of the Fujiwara family. Koretada's daughter gave birth to Prince Morosada, who afterwards reigned as Emperor Kazan Kaneie's daughter was the mother of Okisada, who became Emperor Sanjo\n\n"}

She was best known for her roles as the bungling insecure Esmeralda (1969–70; 1972) on \"Bewitched\", as Cousin Alice (1970–71) on \"Mayberry R.F.D.\", and as Bernice Clifton (1986–93) on \"Designing Women\", for which she received an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1992. She was a regular on \"Nichols\" (1971–72) and \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" (1972–73).\n\nGhostley was born in Eve, Missouri, in 1923 to Edna Muriel (née Rooney) and Harry Francis Ghostley, who worked as a telegraph operator. She grew up in Henryetta, Oklahoma. She attended the University of Oklahoma, but dropped out to pursue a career in theater.\n\nGhostley first came to Broadway in Leonard Sillman's \"New Faces of 1952\" and in the film version released in 1954. She appeared in the 1960 revue \"A Thurber Carnival\" and in \"The Beauty Part\" (1962), playing several distinct roles in each. She also performed in several musical comedies, including \"Shangri-La\" (1956). In 1978, she succeeded Dorothy Loudon, who had created the role of Miss Hannigan in the original Broadway run of the musical \"Annie\".\n\nA veteran of early television, Ghostley appeared as Joy, one of the ugly stepsisters in the 1957 musical television production of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's \"Cinderella\", which starred Julie Andrews in the title role. The other stepsister was played by actress Kaye Ballard. Twelve years later, Ghostley guest-starred as a harried maternity nurse on Ballard's comedy series, \"The Mothers-in-Law\". \nGhostley guest-starred on the NBC police comedy, \"Car 54, Where Are You?,\" with Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne. She portrayed recurring characters on several situation comedies, beginning with \"Bewitched\" in 1966 in \"Maid To Order\", in which Ghostley played an inept maid named Naomi, who was hired by Darrin Stephens (played by Dick York) to assist his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) during her pregnancy. Towards the end of the 1965-66 season, actress-comedian Alice Pearce, who was featured as nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz on \"Bewitched\", died. The producers of the series immediately offered the role of Gladys to Ghostley, who refused it. As a result, in the fall of 1966, character actress Sandra Gould assumed the role of Gladys. In September 1969, after the death of actress Marion Lorne, who played Aunt Clara, Ghostley joined \"Bewitched\" as a semiregular in the role of Esmeralda, a shy witch who served as a maid and babysitter to the Stephens' household. Ghostley's character of Esmeralda was created to replace Aunt Clara's role as a bumbler of magic. (Coincidentally, Ghostley and Lorne shared a brief scene together in the 1967 film \"The Graduate\", a few months prior to Lorne's death and before Ghostley was cast in \"Bewitched\".)\n\nGhostley's Esmeralda appeared in 15 episodes of \"Bewitched\" between 1969 and 1972. During her two years on \"Bewitched\", Ghostley also joined the cast of \"Mayberry R.F.D.\", playing Cousin Alice after Frances Bavier's character, Aunt Bee, was written out of the series. She appeared in 14 episodes.\n\nOn February 22, 1969, she appeared as Aggie on \"The Ghost & Mrs Muir\" (starring Edward Mulhare and Hope Lange). The episode was entitled \"Make Me A Match\". The captain and Mrs. Muir matched her with Claymore Gregg (Charles Nelson Reilly). On March 6, 1970, she appeared on another episode of \"The Ghost & Mrs Muir\", \"Curious Cousin\". She played nosey Cousin Harriet. She interferes with Mrs Muir's private life. To divert her excessive attention, Claymore, posing as Captain Gregg, comes to court her.\n\nAfter eight years, \"Bewitched\" was cancelled by ABC in the spring of 1972. Later that year in September, Ghostley was hired as a semiregular for the ABC-TV variety series, \"The Julie Andrews Hour\"; in addition to participating in songs and sketches, Andrews and Ghostley were featured in a recurring segment as roommates sharing a small apartment. \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" was cancelled by ABC in the spring of 1973 after 24 episodes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ghostley appeared in episodes of situation comedies such as \"Hogan's Heroes\" (alternating with Kathleen Freeman playing Gertrude Linkmaier, General Burkhalter's sister), \"Good Times\", \"Maude\", \"One Day at a Time\", \"The Odd Couple\", and \"What's Happening!!\".\n\nBetween 1986 and 1993, Ghostley portrayed Bernice Clifton, the slightly off-kilter, eccentric friend of Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker's mother, Perky, on \"Designing Women\". She later played Irna Wallingsford in six episodes of \"Evening Shade\". She also had a recurring role of Ida Mae Brindle in the sitcom \"Small Wonder\", which ran from 1985 to 1989. Among many other guest roles, she appeared in a flashback episode as the crazed mother-in-law of Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur) on \"The Golden Girls\". She made a one-time appearance as Great-Grandma in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\". Ghostley also made a few guest appearances on the daytime drama \"Passions\" in 2000, playing the ghost of Matilda Matthews.\n\nAmong her roles in motion pictures, Ghostley appeared in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962), playing Stephanie Crawford, the neighborhood gossip. She appeared in the film version of \"Grease\" as shop teacher Mrs. Murdock. In 1985, she had a supporting role in the Nancy Allen comedy \"Not for Publication\". Alice played Grandmama in the direct-to-video movie \"Addams Family Reunion\".\n\nGhostley received a Tony nomination in the late 1960s for different roles she played in the Broadway comedy \"The Beauty Part\". She also received a Tony award for Best Featured Actress for her role in \"The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window\".\nIn 1992, she earned an Emmy nomination for her role in \"Designing Women\".\n\nGhostley was married to Felice Orlandi, an Italian-American actor, from 1953 until his death in 2003.\n\nGhostley died at her home in Studio City, California, on September 21, 2007, after a long battle with colon cancer and a series of strokes. On August 20, 2009, her ashes were taken to Oak Hill Cemetery in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, and buried with her sister Gladys (died June 21, 2009). The sisters are interred next to their parents and near Alice’s husband, Felice Orlandi.\n\n\n\n"}

The school's current enrollment is approximately 215 students. The school's old building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 2019, for the state of Illinois, Niche ranked Roycemore School as the fourth most diverse private high school, the ninth-best private high school, and the fifth-best private K–12 school. The school currently has a six-to-one student-to-teacher ratio. Roycemore also offers the NU Option program, in which its high school students can take courses at Northwestern University and earn credit, making it the only Independent school to have such a partnership with Northwestern.\n\nRoycemore School was founded in 1915 as a co-ed school, but boys could only go up to 3rd grade. It became fully co-ed in 1962.\n\nIts original location was in north Evanston, Illinois, near Northwestern University. The former Roycemore School building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.\n\nThe National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form identifies the two architecture firms that were involved in the design and realization of Roycemore’s original school buildings. It says that architect Lawrence Buck designed the buildings, with the firm of Talmadge & Watson involved as associated architects. Thomas Eddy Tallmadge is identified as the lead representative for his firm.\n\nIn discussing the style and importance of the buildings in Section 8 of the form, the NRHP nomination says;\n\n\"“Roycemore School is of considerable architectural significance because it is one of only two examples known to exist in the Midwest of an educational building designed according to the principles evolved by such famous early modern architects in England as Charles Voysey and M. H. Baillie Scott. As such it eschews the accoutrements of the historic styles and emphasizes instead the stern virtues of simplicity of form and honesty of expression that gave sustenance to the English progressive movement from Pugin through Eastlake to Morris and Voysey...”\"\n\nAs its property lease with Northwestern University for the lot at Lincoln St. and Orrington Ave. was due to end in 2014, in early 2000 the school began looking for another Evanston location that would allow room to continue a trend of enrollment growth that had occurred over the previous 10 years, with updated technology and to accommodate a larger, regulation-sized gymnasium.\n\nRoycemore began classes at 1200 Davis Street in Evanston on January 6, 2012. The 3-acre lot, adjacent to Evanston's Alexander Park, was the location of a 55,000-square-foot building that was once the headquarters of the General Board of Pension Funds for the United Methodist Church. Roycemore completely renovated the building and added a nearly 8,000-square-foot gymnasium.\n\nThe school has no-cut athletic teams starting in the fifth grade, including basketball, soccer, cross country and volleyball.\n\nRoycemore's mascot is the Griffin and the school colors are blue and gold.\n\nEach year, Roycemore School holds its annual Palio, which is the school's oldest tradition. Palio was modeled after the pageant that proceeds the Palio di Siena in Italy. Students from grades 1–12 display the progress they have made in physical education classes during the year. The emphasis is on rhythmics, dance, gymnastics, and sports skills. Roycemore's Palio has a colorful procession, where each new Kindergarten class is handed down a banner with the coat of arms from the graduating Senior class that the younger students will carry until graduation in twelfth grade.\n\nAnother longstanding tradition at Roycemore is their tumbling program. Starting in third grade, students can be found participating in mounts, lifting other students, or flying through the air as part of their performance. The program culminates in three annual all-school performances, including Palio, for fellow students, parents and alumni.\n\n\n"}

Underwood had created Combato in 1910, a \"non-boxing or wrestling\" unarmed combat system which he taught in Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario, and Defendo grew out of this system.\n\nCombato had its beginning in the Liverpool theatres with jujutsu demonstrations by travelling Japanese wrestlers, Yukio Tani and Taro Miyake. As a boy, Underwood idolized these experts, and rapidly established himself as a prodigy.\n\nThe name Defendo was created on August 15, 1945, in New York City by Underwood's daughter, Pat, when Underwood was a guest in the United States training U.S. Army Rangers and for the American FBI for use in unarmed combat. Underwood was frequently requested by American and Canadian Law Enforcement Agencies to teach his Combato system during World War II, but as the war had ended he refused on the basis that Combato was too aggressive. Underwood was asked to modify the system to remove its lethal applications and instead focus on the Law Enforcement applications of self-defence, compliance and control tactics. He realized that he could not call this system Combato, so his daughter Pat Underwood proposed that he call the system \"Defendo\".\n\nFrom 1945 to 1950 Underwood taught his developing self-defence system in Canada and the USA under the new name. In 1950 he published under copyright \"Defendo, Police System of Self-Defence\", which became one of the first open-hand police tactics manuals used by police departments in Canada and the United States. From 1950 to 1969, Underwood travelled throughout Canada, the United States and in the UK (1965), teaching his system. In 1969, under copyright Underwood published \"Defendo, Occidental System of Self-Protection\".\n\nFrom 1969 to his death on February 8, 1986, in Newmarket, Ontario, Underwood was well known for his system and honoured and profiled frequently by the North American media. In 1980 a short documentary film about Underwood's life and work, entitled \"Don't Mess With Bill\" was nominated for an Oscar at the 53rd Academy Awards in 1981. The film was produced by Pen Densham and John Watson.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1981 Underwood appeared four times on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". He also appeared at that time on all of Hollywood's major talk shows including \"Real People\", \"That's Incredible\", and Merv Griffin; on all occasions, promoting and teaching his system of Defendo.\n\n\n"}

As a child, she took up painting, sculpting and dancing. She went to Mary Wigman's school in Berlin and studied art and dance. After returning to Sweden, she opened a dance school. She moved from Sweden to Paris to train for ballet (after participating with choreographer Astrid Malmborg in an international competition) and worked as a private dance teacher with Fernand Fonssagrives, which then led to a modeling career. She would say that modeling was \"still dancing\". While in Paris in 1936, photographer Willy Maywald discovered her in an elevator and asked her to model hats for him. The photographs were then sent to \"Vogue\", and \"Vogue\" photographer Horst took some test photographs of her. In July 1939, she appeared in the German illustrated weekly \"Der Stern\". Before Fonssagrives came to the United States in 1939, she was already a top model.

While the main focus of the collection is trolley cars (trams), it also includes rapid transit trains, Interurban cars, trolley buses, and motor buses. The Seashore Trolley Museum is owned and operated by the New England Electric Railway Historical Society (NEERHS). Of the museum's collection of more than 250 vehicles, ten trolley and railroad cars that historically operated in Maine were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, as Maine Trolley Cars.\n\nTheodore F. Santarelli de Brasch was one of the founders of the museum, which was initially operated as the Seashore Electric Railway. He graduated from Harvard University and led the museum until he died in 1987.\n\nThe events that led to the formation of the museum started in 1939, when a group of railfans learned that the Biddeford and Saco Railroad was purchasing motor buses to replace its fleet of trolley cars. More and more trolley companies were doing this as the technology of buses had developed to the point that they were reliable and economical.\n\nThe railfans decided to find out if they could purchase a trolley to preserve it for posterity. The railroad was willing to sell them a car (#31, a 12 bench open trolley) for $150. However, it would have to be moved to another location due to local ordinances that prohibited retired trolleys from being used as houses, even though this was not the railfans' intention.\n\nA plot of land, part of a farm, was rented on Log Cabin Road in Kennebunkport, adjacent to the right-of-way for the Atlantic Shore Line Railway's Kennebunk-Biddeford route, and the trolley was moved to it.\n\nAt about the same time, another group of railfans purchased a trolley from the Manchester and Nashua Street Railway. The two groups merged, and the Nashua trolley was brought to the Log Cabin Road site. The group of founders formally incorporated in 1941 as the New England Electric Railway Historical Society.\n\nWorld War II caused the museum to be put on hold, as many members served in the armed forces for the duration. This also brought about a temporary revival of trolley services in many cities, as rubber and gasoline were rationed for the war effort.\nAfter the war, conversion of trolley lines to buses resumed, and created a period of rapid growth for the museum's collection.\n\nIn the 1950s, a diesel-powered electric generator was used to allow the cars to move under their own power. Car 31 was moved into a small building so that it could be repaired and restored. The first major expansion occurred in late 1955 and early 1956, when the Society purchased land near the Biddeford city line along U.S. Route 1. In the summer of 1956, the Seashore Electric Railway began passenger operations on weekends over its of track.\n\nIn 1980, ten of the museum's trolley and railroad cars were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (as \"Maine Trolley Cars\"). These include trolley #31 and other vehicles either built or operated in Maine. Two cars of the Aroostook Valley Railroad, and two built by the York Utilities Company of Sanford are included in this collection.\n\nAs of 2010, the museum had over 260 vehicles. While most are from New England and other areas of the United States, trolleys from Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, Hungary, England, Scotland, Italy, and several other countries are also in the collection. One of the motor buses the museum owns is Biddeford and Saco #31, the bus that replaced trolley #31 in 1939. The bus was donated to the museum by the bus company. The Seashore Trolley Museum continues to acquire new vehicles for the collection.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 am to 5 pm. From Memorial Day to Columbus Day, it is open daily, and from the first weekend of May through Memorial Day, and from Columbus Day to the last weekend in October, it is open on weekends.\n\nThe main building at the museum, the Visitor Center, includes a ticket booth, a museum store with an extensive collection of rare and out-of-print books and DVDs as well as many toys and souvenirs, a snack bar, and an exhibit room with trolley and transit-related artifacts.\n\nThe trolleys that have been restored to operating condition are shown on display in three car barns. A restoration shop with an elevated observation gallery shows visitors how the vehicles are maintained and restored. Additional storage barns and tracks, which are not accessible to the general public, contain vehicles that are awaiting restoration. A few of the restored trolleys are operating on the demonstration line at one time.\n\nRestored trolleys are used on the museum's demonstration railway, which follows the route of the Atlantic Shore Line, a trolley line that ran on the current museum property and connected Kennebunkport to York Beach. Since the line was abandoned in the 1920s, museum volunteers have rebuilt a mile and a half (about 2 km) from scratch. Seashore owns the right of way to Biddeford, which is about from the Visitor Center. A demonstration route leads a mile and a half to Talbot Park (which is a loop to turn around the trolleys) and back to the Visitor Center.\n\nThe collection of trolley buses includes vehicles from all over the country, and the world, of which about twenty are in operating condition. Restoration on as many as six to seven cars is underway at all times. Discussions are under way to extend the trolley bus line and to rehabilitate the existing line.\n\nThe museum has many themed events throughout the operating season (May–October) including dog day, sunset ice cream rides, community appreciation day, veterans' appreciation day, antique auto day, pumpkin patch trolley, transit day, children's story time, and special prelude rides on the first two weekends in December. The exhibit room may be rented for parties, gatherings, meetings or family reunions. In 2014 the museum held its first ever speakeasy event with costumes, special cocktails and music/movies of the era, and planned to do this again in 2015.\n\nThe museum is seeking to raise funds to build a new car house (car barn) and library, as well as for restoration of current buildings, cars, grounds and visitor center. The museum is also proposing to eventually extend the trolley demonstration line to Route 1 in Biddeford.\n\n"}

He was the elder son of Emperor Manuel I and his third wife, Irene Syrikaina, a Trapezuntine noblewoman. He succeeded his half-brother Andronikos in 1266 and ruled for 14 years.\n\nThe details of the internal affairs of his reign are sparse. Beyond the length of his reign, all Michael Panaretos relates explicitly about George is the cryptic statement that he \"was treacherously betrayed by his officials on the mountain of Taurezion and taken captive in June [of 1280]\". Although three different Armenian chronicles state he was killed by Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhan, along with the atabeg of Lori, he was very much alive in 1284 when he returned to Trebizond and attempted to recover his throne during the reign of his brother John II, when Panaretos states he was known as \"the Wanderer\".\n\nMichel Kuršanskis has pointed out that his father's embassy in 1253 to King Louis IX of France, who was then at Sidon, seeking to marry a daughter of his house was the act of a widower. Kuršanskis then convincingly argues that Manuel's marriage to Irene Syrikaina occurred after that year, which means George was no older—and likely several years younger—than 13 at the time of his coronation. So for the first several years of his reign he relied on a regent to govern the Empire.\n\nThe details of the foreign affairs of his reign are relatively more abundant. One factor was that his rival for the claim to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, Michael VIII Palaiologos, had agreed to unify the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, and an agreement was signed at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274; as a result George was increasingly seen as the champion of the anti-Unionist faction. George found himself directly threatened by Mu‘in al-Din Suleyman who controlled Sinope to the west and the Georgian state of Samtzkhe-Meschla to the east; Imereti was also a potential threat, and its ruler, David the Clever had married one of Michael's daughters in 1267. Michael had also married another daughter to Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhan. Consequently, George was forced into negotiations with Michael Palaiologos' enemies. As early as 1266-7 Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, wrote to George; George's response is not known. The protonotary Ogerius reported to Pope Nicholas III that George was upsetting the Union of Churches that Michael Palaiologos promoted. \"It was not so much that Charles of Anjou had a quixotically loyal ally in Trebizond,\" writes Anthony Bryer, \"as that while Michael was forcing his subjects into the union, George was pushed by anti-Unionist refugees from Constantinople into posing as champion of Orthodoxy and into seeking to replace the 'heretical' Michael as emperor in Constantinople.\"\n\nThe Annals of Bishop Stephen state that George had an unnamed daughter, who married a Georgian nobleman. Another possible daughter (or sister) married King Demetre II of Georgia.\n\nThe cryptic note that George was betrayed on the mountain of Taurezion has baffled scholars about both the location and the exact event. No other text directly mentions \"the mountain of Taurezion\". There have been several suggested explanations, starting with the Taurus Mountains, one of several locations to the south of Trebizond, and a Taroutza in eastern Anatolia. Bryer discusses these possibilities before pointing out the weaknesses in their identification, and arguing that by \"Taurezion\" Panaretos meant Tabriz, which was known in a form at the time similar to \"Taurezion\": spellings include the Armenian \"T'awrez\" or \"Davrez\"; Marco Polo called it \"Tauris\", and a Syrian bishop of \"Taurezium\" is mentioned in 1277.\n\nAs for how George was betrayed, there are at least two differing suggestions. On the one hand, George Finlay and William Miller have interpreted this as meaning that he was captured in battle, which has been followed by other historians. On the other hand, Anthony Bryer has published an article in the \"Byzantinische Zeitschrift\" arguing that this passage should be interpreted as saying that George was betrayed to Agaba Khan by his \"archontes\" on a mountain near Tabriz, where Agaba was residing in summer of 1280. Scholars, such as Michel Kuršanskis, have accepted Bryer's interpretation.\n\nA third researcher, Ahmet Zehiroglu, has suggested George was trapped as a result of the Byzantine conspiracy and taken prisoner along with his mother by Abaqa Khan, on Dersim Mountains and in the summer of 1280.\n\nBryer further points out that there are signs George never fully assumed the title of Emperor (\"basileus\"), where there is evidence that his father Manuel had before him, and his brother John after him. No silver coinage was struck in his name—although a surprisingly large amount (over 200 dies) was struck in his father's; Bryer suggests some of it was issued by George in his father's name. Only one of his copper coin issues does he bear the epithet of \"Grand Komnenos\", while in another he is described as \"Despot\" (\"despotes\"), a title subsidiary to Emperor. Further, he is the only ruler of Trebizond that Panaretos, in his chronicle, fails to call \"Grand Komnenos\", and does not refer to his mother Irene Syrikaina as \"\"despoina\"\". \"It is possible that Abaga refused to recognize him as Grand Komnenos,\" Bryer writes, \"hence the subsidiary title of Despot on one of his coin types, his failure to coin silver aspers and Panaretos' reticence in according him any title.\"\n\nHaving made his argument, Bryer then speculates on George's last documented years. Bryer points out that it was not an impostor who appeared in Trebizond in 1284, for \"it is unlikely that John II would have failed to recognize his half-brother\". Instead Bryer suggests that for various reasons Abaga spared George and imprisoned him, and on Abaga's death on 1 April 1282, George was released. Then \"he went to his son-in-law Demetrius II of Georgia and from Georgia launched an attack on Trebizond in 1284\", only to be rejected by the same people who betrayed him four years earlier.\n\n\n"}

The Gardens are bounded by the Yarra River to the north, Princes and Swan street bridges, with Queen Victoria Gardens and Kings Domain across Alexandra Avenue to the south. The gardens are part of the Domain parklands which stretch to the Royal Botanic Gardens and were first laid out in 1901, under the direction of Carlo Catani, Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department. The Alexandra Gardens were named in honor of Alexandra of Denmark, in the year her reign as Queen Consort of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress consort of India began. The Alexandra Gardens are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register due to their historical and archaeological significance.\n\nAlexandra Gardens are part of a larger group of parklands directly south-east of the city, between St. Kilda Road and the Yarra River known as the Domain Parklands, which includes;\n\nFrom the time of European settlement of Melbourne in 1835, the area of the gardens was used for timber cutting, cattle grazing and as a brickmakers' field. Regular flooding occurred until a new channel for the Yarra River was dug from 1896 to 1900 to straighten and widen the river. The spoil was used to fill the swampy lagoons and brickmakers pits and raise the height of the river bank where Alexandra Gardens now stands. Landscaping occurred immediately, and the gardens were planned and laid out for the visit of the Duke of York in May 1901.\n\nPedestrian and cycle access to the gardens is via steps or a ramp from Princes Bridge, or along the promenade from Southbank under Princes Bridge. Vehicular access is provided by Boathouse Drive from Alexandra Avenue. Next to Princes Bridge bicycles are available for hire to explore the Capital City Trail along the river. Also the prominent, The Around the Bay in a Day cycling event has its finish line at the Gardens.\n\nA skate park opened in 2001 in the gardens, with a café and first aid station, close to some distinctive Canary Island Palms which were planted in 1911.\n\nAlongside the Yarra River numerous rowing club boathouses nestle in the gardens, including the Mercantile Rowing Club. The Olympic champions, the Oarsome Foursome, were known to train along the Yarra river.\n\nThe annual \"Henley-on-Yarra regatta\" was held from 1904, every spring just before Melbourne Cup day. For a day and a night, Melburnians flocked to the Yarra to watch this sporting event, with attendances peaking at 300,000 in 1925. After World War II, the event declined in significance, however the annual \"Australian Henley Rowing Regatta\" still occurs as an amateur event in December, with recent attempts to increase its popularity.\n\nPast the boathouses are lawns with electric barbecues, which are popular spots for picnics and office parties around Christmas time. As well as lawns fronting the Yarra river, the gardens contain a star-shaped garden bed representing the Federation of Australia; many mature trees including elms and an avenue of planes and oak trees along Boathouse Drive; ornamental flower beds.\n\n"}

It introduced the pipe-smoking, well-meaning but clumsy character of Monsieur Hulot, who appears in Tati's subsequent films, including \"Mon Oncle\" (1958), \"Playtime\" (1967), and \"Trafic\" (1971). The film gained an international reputation for its creator when released in 1953. The film was very successful as it had a total of 5,071,920 admissions in France.\n\n\"Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot\" follows the generally harmless misadventures of a lovable, gauche Frenchman, Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself), as he joins the \"newly emerging holiday-taking classes\" for a summer vacation at a modest seaside resort. The film affectionately lampoons several hidebound elements of French political and economic classes, from chubby capitalists and self-important Marxist intellectuals to petty proprietors and drab dilettantes, most of whom find it nearly impossible to free themselves, even temporarily, from their rigid social roles in order to relax and enjoy life.\n\nThe film also gently mocks the confidence of postwar western society in the optimistic belief in capitalist production, and the value of complex technology over simple pleasures, themes that would resurface in his later films.\n\n\nFor the most part, in \"Les Vacances,\" spoken dialogue is limited to the role of background sounds. Combined with frequent long shots of scenes with multiple characters, Tati believed that the results would tightly focus audience attention on the comical nature of humanity when interacting as a group, as well as his own meticulously choreographed visual gags. However, the film is by no means a 'silent' comedy, as it uses natural and man-made sounds not only for comic effect but also for character development.\n\nThe film was made in both French and English language versions. While Tati had experimented with color film in \"Jour de fête,\" \"Les Vacances\" is black and white. The jazz score, mostly variations on the theme \"Quel temps fait-il à Paris\", was written by Alain Romans.\n\n\"Les Vacances\" was shot in the town of Saint-Marc-sur-Mer, which lies on the edge of the industrial port of Saint-Nazaire, in the Département of Loire-Atlantique. Tati had fallen in love with the beguiling coastline while staying in nearby Port Charlotte with his friends, M. and Mme Lemoine, before the war and resolved to return one day to make a film there. Tati and his crew turned up in the summer of 1951, \"took over the town and then presented it to the world as the quintessence of French middle-class life as it rediscovered its rituals in the aftermath of the Second World War.\" \"Neither too big nor too small, [St Marc fitted the bill] - a sheltered inlet, with a graceful curve of sand, it boasted a hotel on the beach on which the main action could be centred. Beach huts, windbreaks, fishing boats and outcrops of rock helped to complete a picture which was all the more idyllic for being so unspectacular.\" A bronze statue of Monsieur Hulot was later erected and overlooks the beach where the film was made.\n\nOn its release in the United States, Bosley Crowther's review said that the film contained \"much the same visual satire that we used to get in the 'silent' days from the pictures of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and such as those.\" He said the film \"exploded with merriment\" and that Tati \"is a long-legged, slightly pop-eyed gent whose talent for caricaturing the manners of human beings is robust and intense... There is really no story to the picture... The dialogue... is at a minimum, and it is used just to satirize the silly and pointless things that summer people say. Sounds of all sorts become firecrackers, tossed in for comical point.\"\n\nTati biographer David Bellos has described the film as \"Sublime,\" and said that, \"It was through this film that I first fell in love with France. I think that is true of a lot of people.\" The journalist Simon O'Hagan, writing on the occasion of the film's 50th anniversary in 2003, wrote that the film, \"might contain the greatest collection of sight gags ever committed to celluloid, but it is the context in which they are placed and the atmosphere of the film that lift it into another realm. The central character is an unforgettable amalgam of bafflement at the modern world, eagerness to please and just the right amount of eccentricity - i.e. not too much - his every effort to fit in during his seaside holiday merely succeeds in creating chaos out of orderliness. Puncturing the veneer of the comfortably off at play is by no means the least of Tati's concerns. But, [there is] an elegiac quality [too], the sense that what Tati finds funny he also cherishes.\" \n\nThe film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as '; its provisional designation was '. Daphnis is about 8 kilometres in diameter, and orbits the planet in the Keeler Gap within the A ring.\n\nThe moon was named in 2006 after Daphnis, a shepherd, pipes player, and pastoral poet in Greek mythology; he was descendant of the Titans, after whom the largest moons of Saturn are named. Both Daphnis and Pan, the only other known shepherd moon to orbit within Saturn's main rings, are named for mythological figures associated with shepherds.\n\nBefore it was photographed, the existence of a moon in Daphnis's position had already been inferred from gravitational ripples observed on the outer edge of the Keeler gap. \n\nThe discovery of Daphnis was announced by the Cassini Imaging Science Team on May 6, 2005. The discovery images were taken by the \"Cassini\" probe over 16 min on May 1, 2005, from a time-lapse sequence of 0.180 second narrow-angle-camera exposures of the outer edge of the A ring. The moon was subsequently found in 32 low-phase images taken of the F ring on April 13, 2005 (spanning 18 min) and again in two high-resolution (3.54 km/pixel) low-phase images taken on May 2, 2005, when its 7 km disk was resolved.\n\nThe inclination and eccentricity of Daphnis's orbit are very small, but distinguishable from zero. Both, particularly the inclination, are significantly greater than those of Pan (the larger moonlet which forms the Encke Gap). Daphnis's eccentricity causes its distance from Saturn to vary by ~9 km, and its inclination causes it to move up and down by ~17 km. The Keeler Gap, within which Daphnis orbits, is about 42 km wide.\n\nDaphnis orbits within the Keeler gap in Saturn's rings. As it orbits, it creates gravitational ripples on the edges of the gap as ring particles are attracted toward the moon and then fall back down toward the ring. The waves made by the moon in the inner edge of the gap precede it in orbit, while those on the outer edge lag behind it, due to the differences in relative orbital speed. In a photograph taken on January 18, 2017, a tendril of ring particles can be seen to extend toward the moon; according to JPL, \"this may have resulted from a moment when Daphnis drew a packet of material out of the ring, and now that packet is spreading itself out.\"\n\nOn January 18, 2017, Daphnis was photographed from a sufficiently close distance to reveal its shape. The moon was discovered to be an irregularly-shaped object with a mostly smooth surface, a few craters, and an equatorial ridge. \n\n"}

{"id": "1866200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866200", "title": "Policoro", "text": "Policoro\n\nPolicoro (Lucano: ) is a town and \"comune\" in the province of Matera, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata. With some 17,000 inhabitants, is bounded by the towns of Rotondella, Scanzano Jonico and Tursi. Situated on the coast, its population swells in the summertime due to an influx of tourists who come to enjoy the Lido di Policoro.\n\nThe construction of the town was started in 680 BC by Greeks colonists from Colophon, but the town was destroyed in the 6th century BC by the Achaean colonies in coalition with Metaponto, Crotone, and Sibari.\n\nIn 432 BCE, the town was rebuilt in the same place as before and was called Heraclea (also Heracleia or Herakleia). In very little time, it became richer and more famous than the nearby town Siris. In 280 BCE, the Battle of Heraclea happened there during the war between Taranto and Rome.\n\nThe Tables of Heraclea date back to this period and they are now located in the Archeology Museum of Naples. These ancient bronze tablets contain texts in Greek and Latin that discuss public and constitutional rules and laws of the town, one such being \"Lex Iulia Municipalis\".\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the entire area depopulated and Heraclea lost its prestige, becoming a little village on a small hill. It was called Policoro, Πολύχωρον meaning \"large place\" in Greek. The population was sheltered from nearby villages, which were threatened, by numerous invasions and raids. Eventually, the village became a baronial feud and the town developed around the baronial castle, used as a residence from 1000 CE for hunting because of the vast forests owned by local noble families, such as the Berlingieri.\n\nOnly after 1950, thanks to the work to reclaim the land which had become marshy and unhealthy over the centuries and also to the agrarian reform that split and redistributed the land to guarantee a fast development and resettlement, Policoro received municipal autonomy. This change attracted families to move to Policoro from all parts of the region.\n\nIt is on the Ionian coast, 70 km far from Taranto and Matera. Policoro has a hot Mediterranean climate and enjoys mild winters with moderate rainfall. Summers are warm to hot and also dry and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July has only two or three days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above 20 °C and frequently reaches 30 °C+. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months (July and August) is around 37 °C. During winter, days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. Frost is unusual and snowfall is extremely rare that they are remembered by the townspeople as special events. The last noticeable snowfall occurred in early January 2017. The average minimum temperature in January is around 7 °C. Spring starts mild and rainy in late March and becomes increasingly warmer and sunnier towards June.\nEvents in the ton include\nPolicoro had a football team, Policoro 2000 Calcio, until the 2009 Championships. During the 2009–2010 season, Policoro had two teams, A.S.D. Policoro 2000 and A.S.D. Borussia Pleiade. Since the 2010–2011 season, the two football teams combined into one team, A.S.D Policoro Heraclea. The colors of the team were light blue, white, and red, but then they returned to the original colors of white and light blue. Now, the team is called Real Metapontino and they play in Serie D.\nIn the 2010–2011 season, the team Avis Borussia Policoro were promoted to Serie B and now they play in Serie A2.\nIn 2016, Policoro created its first boys’ basketball team, A.S.D. Policoro Basket, for local teenagers. Their home games are played at Palaercole.\n\nOn April 19, 2017, Policoro was mentioned in a “Too Much Exposition Theatre” sketch starring Alec Baldwin on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" as a possible location for a shipwrecked Italian cousin.\n\nThe following films were filmed in and around Policoro: \n\n\n<BR>\n"}

Martin\n\nAnn Matthews Martin (born August 12, 1955) is an American children's fiction writer, known best for \"The Baby-Sitters Club\" series.\n\nAnn Matthews Martin grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. Her mother, Edith, was a pre-school teacher and her father, Henry, was a cartoonist for \"The New Yorker\" and other publications. Her mother's ancestry can be traced back to the pilgrims who traveled on the Mayflower in 1620. She had one younger sister, Jane.\n\nMartin developed an interest in writing from an early age. Before she was old enough to write, she would dictate stories to her mother to write down for her. Some of her favorite authors at that time were Lewis Carroll, P. L. Travers, Hugh Lofting, Astrid Lindgren, and Roald Dahl. Martin loved creative writing in elementary school and discovered her passion for writing in second grade. She began writing short stories, and her fourth-grade teacher wrote on her student folder that she would make a wonderful writer because she spent so much of her free time writing in notebooks. Her favorite subjects in middle school and high school were English and French. Her least favorite subject was Math.\n\nAs a teen, Martin loved working with children and decided to become a teacher. She wanted to help children with disabilities, and she worked during the summer at the Eden Institute, a school for autistic children in her hometown. \n\nAfter graduating from Princeton High School in 1973, Martin attended Smith College from 1973-1977. She studied early-childhood education and child psychology. Her senior thesis was on the use of children’s literature in the classroom. She lived in Gardiner House and wrote for Smith College newspaper, \"The Sophian.\" Describing her Smith education, Martin said “It was an environment of strong, independent women, both the students and the professors.” Her time at Smith influenced her identity as a feminist and inspired her to portray female characters who were like the women she knew in her own life.\n\nAfter graduating from Smith College, Martin taught in a split fourth and fifth-grade classroom at Plumfield School in Noroton, Connecticut. Her students, ages 8–13, struggled with learning disabilities including dyslexia and autism. Martin said that her work with special needs children influenced her writing about children.\n\nAfter teaching, Martin decided to pursue publishing. She worked her way up from an editorial assistant to a senior editor, and she worked for several well-known children’s book publishers, including Pocket Books and Scholastic. She is now a full-time writer.\n\nIn 1983, she published her first book, \"Bummer Summer\", which earned the Children’s Choice Award in 1985. She began writing \"The Baby-Sitters Club\" series in 1985 while working for Scholastic as a children’s book editor. After Martin wrote the first 35 novels in \"The Baby-Sitters Club\" series she has since concentrated on writing single novels, many of which are set in the 1960s. One of those novels, \"A Corner of the Universe\", won a Newbery Honor in 2003. In 2010, Martin published a prequel to \"The Baby-Sitters Club\" series titled \"The Summer Before\". \n\nMartin finds the ideas for her books from many different sources; some are based on personal experiences, while others are based on childhood memories and feelings. Many are about contemporary problems and struggles. All of her characters, including the members of \"The Baby-Sitters Club\", are fictional, but many of her characters are based on real people. Sometimes she names her characters after people she knows, and other times she simply chooses names that she likes.\n\nIn 1990, Martin and her colleagues founded \"The Lisa Libraries\" to honor and memorialize their friend Lisa Novak. This non-profit organization distributes new books to children and establishes libraries in under-served areas. In the same year, Martin also founded the Ann M. Martin Foundation, which provides financial support for art, education, and literacy programs in addition to programs for abused and stray animals.\n\nMartin currently maintains a fairly quiet public profile. After living in New York City for many years, Martin moved to the Hudson Valley in upstate New York, where she enjoys nature and fostering kittens. Martin posts semi-regular updates and snapshots of her life on her Facebook page. She stays busy with author appearances and adaptations of her works such as the Babysitters' Club Club graphic novels and network series. Martin quietly came out as queer in 2016. She was previously in a relationship with Laura Godwin, with whom she wrote the four Doll People books.\n\nSeries longer than two books are listed in the next section.\n\nStandalone novels\n\nNovels and sequels\n\nPicture books\n\nShort stories\n\nOther works\n\nSeries of two books are incorporated in the previous section.\n\n\n35 volumes to 1990, continued by other writers with Martin\n\nTwelve books to 1998\n\nFifteen books to 2000\n\n"}

The first game at the new stadium was a 24–0 Nebraska victory over Oklahoma on October 13, 1923.\n\nA series of expansions has brought the stadium's current capacity to 85,458, but attendance numbers regularly exceed 90,000. Nebraska has sold out an NCAA-record 375 consecutive games at Memorial Stadium, a streak that dates back to 1962. When full, Memorial Stadium holds more people than all but two Nebraska cities (Omaha and Lincoln).\n\nIn the fall of 1922, a drive for $430,000 in funds to build a new football stadium was undertaken by faculty, students, alumni and friends of the university. Designed by John Latenser, Sr., a notable Omaha architect, the stadium was named Memorial Stadium to honor all Nebraskans who served in the Civil and Spanish–American Wars and those 751 Nebraskans who died in World War I. Later, the stadium would also honor the 3,839 Nebraskans who died in World War II, the 225 who died in Korea, and the 422 who died in Vietnam. Construction was completed in just over 90 working days; Memorial Stadium was dedicated on October 20, 1923.\n\nInscribed on the four corners of the stadium are the following words, written by former Nebraska professor of philosophy Hartley Burr Alexander:\n\nA statue of former head coach Tom Osborne and former quarterback Brook Berringer can be found at the main entrance of the Osborne Athletic Complex on the north side of the stadium. Berringer, a native Nebraskan and backup quarterback on Nebraska's 1994 and 1995 national championship-winning teams, died in a plane crash on April 18, 1996, just two days before the 1996 NFL Draft, where he was projected to be an early- to mid-round pick. In 2013, a statue of former head coach Bob Devaney was unveiled at the entrance of the newly renovated east stadium, just before Nebraska's season opener against Wyoming. Nebraska and Wyoming were the only two schools Devaney served as a head coach at the collegiate level at.\n\nMemorial Stadium has undergone several phases of expansion and renovation since its original construction. The original stadium– the lower level of the current structure's east and west sideline seats– seated 31,000 people. It was modeled after Ohio State's Ohio Stadium.\n\nPermanent seats were built in the south end zone in 1964, turning the stadium into a 48,000-seat horseshoe. The north end zone was enclosed in two stages from 1965 to 1966, resulting in a 65,000-seat bowl. The south end zone was expanded further in 1972, raising capacity to 74,000.\n\nA major renovation in 1999 added 42 luxury boxes above the west stands; the stadium was rededicated and the playing surface was renamed after former head coach Tom Osborne. Reflecting Nebraska's rise to national prominence during his 34 years as an assistant coach (1964–1972) and head coach (1973–1997), the stadium's capacity more than doubled during his tenure.\n\nIn 2004, construction began to renovate and expand the north end zone, adding an additional 6,000 seats and 13 luxury boxes called \"Skyline Suites\", which brought capacity to 81,067. At the time of its completion in 2004, the 33-foot (10 m) tall, 120-foot (37 m) wide scoreboard at Memorial Stadium was the largest in any college football stadium (it is now 20th). Before the 2009 season, two new HD video screens were added on the northeast and northwest pillars of the original stadium, bringing the total number of HD screens in the stadium to five. Concurrently, ribbon boards stretching the length of the field were installed along the east and west balconies of the stadium.\n\nOn October 15, 2010, the university announced that its Board of Regents had approved an expansion project anticipated to cost up to $65 million, increasing the stadium's listed seating capacity to 87,000. This expansion was built on the stadium's east side, and included 3,300 general admission seats, 2,119 new club seats and 38 additional skybox suites. The expansion totaled more than 6,000 new seats and brought the total number of private suites inside the stadium to 101. The original east facade of the stadium, plus Gate 20, was preserved within a new entrance lobby. The expansion included creation of the first standing room-only area in Memorial Stadium, and was made available for companies and private parties to host events on a game-to-game basis. In addition, the university created a cutting-edge athletics research facility in addition to another dedicated to campus research. The expansion project was completed and dedicated on August 22, 2013. The project was initially voted on by fans of the football program, who were asked if they preferred expanding the stadium capacity, or preserving the stadium's ongoing NCAA-record sell-out streak. The outcome of the polling was overwhelmingly in favor of expansion while maintaining the sellout streak.\n\nIn 2015, the university replaced bleachers along the top sections of the North Stadium and in doing so increased the width of the seats from 18 inches to 22 inches. Also, some seats were removed in the southwest corner of the stadium in order to put in a new aisle to aid in crowd congestion. The result of the seat widening and removal saw a decrease of about 1,100 seats in Memorial Stadium. When filled to capacity, crowds will now be around 90,000, instead of over 91,000, as was commonplace in previous years.\n\nIn 2017, the university increased the width of seating in North Stadium row 80 and above from 18 inches to 22-24 inches and in South Stadium, Section 14 rows 16 to 98 from 18 inches to 20-22 inches. This resulted in an overall reduction in stadium capacity to 85,458.\n\n\n\nMemorial Stadium was the first college football stadium in Division I-A to install FieldTurf, in 1999. A second FieldTurf installation featuring an alternating light green/dark green \"mowing\" pattern every five yards was put in place prior to the 2005 season, to coincide with a removal of a fairly significant crown that had been in place for decades. A third FieldTurf installation was put in place prior to the 2013 season. The new turf features new construction materials for a \"lighter and cooler\" playing surface incorporating cork into the top layer of the traditional recycled tire surface.\n\nStarting in the early 1980s, portable lighting was occasionally installed for late-autumn games shown on national television, usually those against the University of Oklahoma. The first proper night game at Memorial Stadium took place on September 6, 1986, when Nebraska defeated Florida State 34–17.\n\nPermanent lighting was not installed until 1999, with their first use against Iowa State on Oct. 9, 1999. In 2018, due to limitations of the lighting system and lack of available parts for repair, the lights were replaced with a modern Musco LED system.\n\nFor the 2014 season, a $12.3 million project was completed that replaced the 20-year-old sound system in Memorial Stadium. A new single-point system was installed on the video board in North Stadium that pushes sound throughout the entire facility. A new state-of-the-art wireless network system was also installed throughout the stadium, to provide WiFi and cellular data access for fans to enhance the gameday experience. Additionally, the exterior of the West Stadium was bricked in order to match the appearance of the North and East Stadiums.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2017 football season, new Mitsubishi videoboards were installed within the existing structure of the previous HuskerVision screens. While the majority of the screens remained the same size, the pixel density increased from 20mm spacing to 10mm, dramatically increasing the quality of in-game content and scoreboard legibility. Memorial Stadium is one of two college stadiums with 10mm displays, the other being Notre Dame Stadium. Additionally, the project involved replacing the two north tower displays with \"wrap-around\" screens, lengthening existing ribbon displays, and adding an upper ribbon display to East Stadium. Before the addition of the tower wraps, fans seated in North stadium below the main videoboard couldn't see replays and other video content without taking their eyes off the game and turning around. Memorial Stadium was the first college football stadium to install videoboards.\n\nThe following are the top ten highest attended games at Memorial Stadium:\n\nSince 1996, Memorial Stadium has been the host for the Nebraska School Activities Association's state high school football championship finals, including small schools that play eight-man football (still played), which are usually on fields smaller than standard size. Prior to the move to Memorial Stadium, finals for each class were contested on the home fields of the high schools involved. The state's six-man football championship finals are played on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Kearney.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866206", "title": "Pipe rolls", "text": "Pipe rolls\n\nThe Pipe rolls, sometimes called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls of the Pipe are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.\n\nThey were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.\n\nThe Pipe rolls are named after the \"pipe\" shape formed by the rolled up parchments on which the records were originally written. There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they \"piped\" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or pipe of wine. They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.\n\nThe Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually conducted at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in instalments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.\n\nThe earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129–30, and the continuous series begins in 1155–56, and continued for almost seven hundred years.\n\nCombined with the Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.\n\nThe \"Dialogus de Scaccario\" or \"Dialogue concerning the Exchequer\", written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The \"Dialogue\" was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the \"Dialogue\", the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The \"Dialogue\" also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.\n\nThe main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.\n\nAlthough they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.\n\nExpenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses, wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons, hunting expenses, payments to acquire a governmental office, payments to mercenaries, and the costs of bags and casks to transport silver pennies about the kingdom.\n\nInformation about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons. The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles. The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.\n\nCertain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.\n\nAlthough the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years. An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the Cotton Library at the British Museum. Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign, but others feel that they were introduced by King William I (reigned 1066–1087). The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian Pauline Stafford argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of Cnut (reigned 1016–1035), Æthelred II (reigned 978–1016), and Edgar the Peaceable (reigned 959–975). There is a reference to the king's \"rolls\" in a writ from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of Westminster of ten shillings, but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later cartulary, and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.\n\nAfter the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).\n\nThe surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of £24,500. This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.\n\nBy the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of \"receipt rolls\" and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls. A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate \"Estreat rolls\", and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls. In 1284 the \"Statutes of Rhuddlan\" were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls. At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a \"d\" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.\n\nYet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the \"Cowick Ordinance\" of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the \"Cowick Ordinance\" attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.\n\nIn 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.\n\nThe Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.\n\nThey were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about wide. The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe. They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the Patent Rolls were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.\n\nSometimes they are referred to, in Latin, as \"magnus rotulus pipae\". Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.\n\nThe rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650. During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the Chancellor, and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor. The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material.\n\nThe example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.\n\nA number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.\n\nThe Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.\n\nThe earliest Pipe rolls were published by the Record Commission in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the Public Record Office in 1844 (the rolls for 1155–58). The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.\n\nIn 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a text publication society) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of Walford Dakin Selby and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls. It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224. Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the Yale University Press. Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in \"record type\", designed to produce a near-facsimile of the original manuscript, including its scribal abbreviations. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.\n\nThe Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II. Rolls for the Irish Exchequer and the Norman Exchequer have also been published.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866211", "title": "Straitjacket Fits", "text": "Straitjacket Fits\n\nStraitjacket Fits formed in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1986 and were a prominent band in the Flying Nun label's second wave of the Dunedin sound.\n\nLike many of their Flying Nun stable-mates, the band hailed from the southern city of Dunedin. They formed from the ashes of The DoubleHappys, a band comprising Shayne Carter, Wayne Elsey and John Collie. The tragic accidental death of Elsey saw Carter and Collie join forces with David Wood (ex-Working With Walt) in 1986 to form Straitjacket Fits. Andrew Brough (from The Orange) signed on the following year, adding a foil in the form of a pop sensibility to Carter's more raucous songwriting. From their inception, the sound of the band was marked by the seemingly incongruous but effective pairing of Carter's rough abrasive voice and strident guitar and Andrew Brough's saccharine-sweet vocals and pop hooks.\n\n1987 marked the release of the band's first EP. \"Life in One Chord\" spent 10 weeks in the Top 50. Of the four songs, \"She Speeds\", was to become a hallmark song. It was later judged one of New Zealand's ten best popular songs to date. The edgy lead vocal (from Carter) was underpinned with a dynamic jagged guitar and stabs of strings which tumbled into a churning melodic chorus on which Brough's voice soared. The opposite approach was taken on \"Sparkle That Shines\", its gentle downbeat melody sung by Brough giving way to a chorus laced with Carter's knife-edge harmonies.\n\nThe band left Dunedin, briefly moving to Christchurch, before making the shift to the country's main marketplace, Auckland in 1988. Their first album \"Hail\" was produced by Terry Moore (a former member of The Chills) and was released later that year (it would later be re-released on CD, accompanied by the four songs from \"Life in One Chord\"). The band's first overseas venture, to Australia, came in 1989, followed soon by a tour of Europe. The band were in Berlin the week the wall fell.\n\nIn 1990 the band started work on their follow-up album \"Melt\" (produced by Gavin Mackillop), which was to produce moderate hits with the Brough composition \"Down In Splendour\" and Carter's \"Bad Note For A Heart\". The following year the band was back on the road with an extensive tour. Straitjacket Fits supported My Bloody Valentine in Australia and The La's in the United States. But the strain was beginning to show, with reputed \"musical differences\" between Carter and Brough. Brough left the band at the end of the tour, and was replaced by guitarist Mark Petersen.\n\n1992 saw the release of EP \"Done\". It reached number 11 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart. Produced by Tony Cohen in Melbourne and without Brough's involvement, \"Done\" was an altogether louder and more guitar-driven record. The band then moved to California to record their third album \"Blow\", with producer Paul Fox. The album was released in 1993, but lacked the carefully balanced dynamic that had always been evident in the interplay between Carter and Brough. It produced the singles, \"Cat Inna Can\" and \"If I Were You\". A US tour culminated with an appearance on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" on 11 November 1993, but the writing was largely on the wall for the band and they decided to go into a semi-permanent hiatus, following their appearance at 1994's Big Day Out.\n\nIn 1993, the band contributed the track \"Brittle\" to the AIDS-Benefit Album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization.\n\nIn 1998, a self-titled CD was released. Its 16 tracks were all previously available on other releases; the CD is essentially a \"best-of\" compilation.\n\nPost-Straitjacket Fits, Shayne Carter found success with his band Dimmer, whose first album bore little similarity to that of Straitjacket Fits. Allowed more complete control of the music's sound, his band's music was sparser and included more electronics. Gone are the strident guitars, although they returned on some later releases. Andrew Brough released one album with the band Bike, before moving back to Dunedin and retreating from the music scene. John Collie became a photographer of some note who has exhibited his work widely.\n\nIn 2001, as part of the Australasian Performing Right Association's 75th anniversary, a poll was conducted on New Zealand's top 100 songs of all time. Straitjacket Fits' song \"She Speeds\" was voted at number nine. \"Down In Splendour\" was at number 32, and \"If I Were You\" at number 88.\n\nIn 2005, Straitjacket Fits reformed without Brough for a brief series of concerts around New Zealand.\n\nIn 2008, the band received the New Zealand Herald Legacy Award at the Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards, and were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. In his acceptance speech, Carter said \"To all the artists out there who are brave enough to think outside of the square - kia kaha.\"\n\nDavid Wood died suddenly, on 17 November 2010. A service for David was held at the Pt Chevalier RSA on the following Monday. He left behind a wife and two children.\n\nAndrew Brough died on February 4, 2020.\n\nThe imminent closure of Auckland venue the King's Arms in 2018 led to of a one-off reunion of Dimmer (Shayne Carter's post-SJF band) and a group of \"special guests\" on February 9. Those guests were John Collie and Mark Petersen who, along with Carter and Dimmer bassist Vaughan Williams, played a set of Straitjacket Fits songs (without taking on the band name). It was the first time Carter, Collie and Petersen had performed without the late David Wood.\n\n\nThe group has appeared on many compilations and soundtracks since their inception in both New Zealand. The following is a list of these albums that have featured tracks by the Straitjacket Fits.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866216", "title": "North Delta", "text": "North Delta\n\nNorth Delta (founded as Annieville) is a largely middle-class commuter town situated in the Lower Mainland, of British Columbia, Canada. The community is the most populous of the three communities (North Delta, Ladner, and Tsawwassen) that make up the City of Delta. North Delta is home to numerous parks and recreational opportunities. Alongside North Delta is Burns Bog, the largest raised peat urban bog in North America. As well, Watershed Park provides walking and biking trails, home to many artesian aquifers. Besides this, North Delta is home to a large amount of green-space. As of the 2006 census, North Delta has a population of 51,623.\n\nNorth Delta borders Surrey on the east side by Scott Road (or 120th Street), and on the north side by 96th Avenue and the Fraser River. To the west across the river is Annacis Island and Richmond, accessible via the Alex Fraser Bridge. Burns Bog is to the west, bordered by Highway 91. Clark Drive in Panorama Ridge marks the community boundary to the south.\n\nNorth Delta is mostly divided up into a grid with streets running north/south and east/west. Running east/west are the avenues, they are numbered with increasing numbers when traveling north, and vice versa. Running north/south, the streets are numbered following the grid laid out for the municipality of Delta. This grid is part of the greater street grid set out by the British Royal Engineers in the 19th Century. Lower numbers are nearest the Pacific Ocean, and the street numbering continues up through the 200s in Langley.\n\nSome of the main arterial roads in North Delta are River Road, Nordel Way, and 120th Street (Scott Road).\n\nBefore the construction of the South Fraser Perimeter Road, River Road ran along the shore of the Fraser River. It starts in Surrey, and travels through the industrial zones of North Delta and the residential community of Annieville before junctioning the Nordel Way, where a driver can access Highway 91. No longer part of North Delta, River Road continues north of Burns Bog and terminates at Highway 99, where it becomes Highway 17A. The South Fraser Perimeter Road, part of Highway 17, is a freeway that opened in 2013, running closer to the shore than River Road for the entirety of its North Delta portion.\n\nNordel Way is a high speed corridor that runs from River Road to Surrey, where it merges with 88th Avenue. It is mostly used by drivers commuting from the northern parts of North Delta and Surrey to Highway 91 and back. Until the late 1990s, Nordel Way terminated at 116th Street, but it was extended into Surrey.\n\n120th Street, or Scott Road, is the street that divides Delta and Surrey to the east. Many businesses and shopping areas are along this street. The street travels into Surrey beyond 96th Avenue and joins with King George Highway, where one can cross the Pattullo Bridge into New Westminster.\n\n72nd Avenue, 64th Avenue, and 56th Avenue (Highway 10) are also major connectors, having access from Highway 91 into Surrey.\n\nThere is no major transit exchange in North Delta. However, before the 2000s, the Scottsdale Exchange was located in North Delta by Scott Road before it was moved to the other side of the border, within walking distance. The bus routes provide residents of North Delta connections to nearby SkyTrain stations such as Scott Road Station and 22nd Street Station, among other destinations.\n\n\nNorth Delta has five high schools: North Delta Senior Secondary, Seaquam Secondary, Sands Secondary, Burnsview, and Delview. Prior to the 2004–2005 school year, Sands, Burnsview, and Delview were Junior Secondary schools, offering only grades 8 to 10. Graduates from these three schools fed into North Delta Senior Secondary, which offered only a grade 11 and 12 curriculum; Seaquam Secondary was the only complete grade 8 to 12 secondary school in North Delta. North Delta Senior Secondary typically had one of the largest graduating classes in British Columbia. Despite the controversy surrounding the reconfiguration, in the academic year 2004 - 2005 the three Junior Secondary schools were reconfigured to include grade 11 and 12 classes, while North Delta Senior Secondary was expanded to include junior level courses.\n\nElementary schools in North Delta include McCloskey, Cougar Canyon, Devon Gardens, Chalmers, Sunshine Hills, Pinewood, Heath, Annieville, Hellings, Richardson, Gray, Jarvis, Immaculate Conception, Gibson, and Brooke.\n\nNorth Delta is home to three recreational complexes: the recently renovated Sungod Recreation Centre, which houses both a swimming pool and an indoor ice rink; the Great Pacific Forum ice arena at the base of the Alex Fraser Bridge; and North Delta's oldest sports complex, the North Delta Recreational Centre, which consists of an ice rink, 6 curling sheets, and an outdoor pool. Lying adjacent to the North Delta Recreational Centre is a small kids' camp, a large softball park, and skateboard park.\n\nNorth Delta is home to only one branch of Tim Hortons, but is within a block of four. It is also home to the first Krispy Kreme doughnut shop in British Columbia and the only Canadian store west of Mississauga. Other businesses found in North Delta include McDonald's, Burger King, COBS Bread, Safeway, Superstore, Dairy Queen, Pizza Hut, London Drugs, Esquire's Coffee, White Spot and Freshslice.\n\nNorth Delta's major shopping centres are Scottsdale Centre, Scott 72 Centre, Delta Shoppers Mall and Kennedy Heights.\n\n\n\n"}

The Ombudsman \"is principally tasked to investigate on its own or upon complaint by any person, in any form or manner, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, which appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.\" After an investigation, the Ombudsman files charges at the Sandiganbayan, a special anti-graft court.\n\nThe Offices of the Ombudsman includes the Ombudsman's own office, along with offices for a team composed of a Sheriff, the Ombudsman's second in command, and six other deputies who lead their respective divisions or bureaus.\n\nThe Office of the Ombudsman predates the 1987 Constitution. There have been several offices established under various presidents of the Philippines whose duties are now subsumed under the Office of the Ombudsman. President Elpidio Quirino established the Integrity Board in 1950; President Ramon Magsaysay, the Presidential Complaints and Action Commission in 1957; President Carlos P. Garcia, the Presidential Committee on Administration Performance Efficiency in 1958; President Diosdado Macapagal, the Presidential Anti-Graft Committee in 1962; and finally President Ferdinand Marcos, the Presidential Agency on Reform and Government Operations in 1966.\n\nIn 1969, the Office of the Citizens Counselor was created by the Republic Act No. 6028. It was primarily designed to conduct fact-finding investigations and make recommendations to Congress and the President. The office was \"not at all implemented\". Subsequently, Marcos created the Complaints and Investigation Office in 1970 and the Presidential Administrative Assistance Committee in 1971.\n\nNone of these were successful. None were independent.\n\nIn the martial law-era 1973 Philippine Constitution (Sections 5 and 6, Article XIII), provided for the establishment of a special court called the Sandiganbayan and an office of the ombudsman called the Tanodbayan. On June 11, 1978, during martial law, the late strong-man President Ferdinand Marcos created by presidential decree the office of the Tanodbayan. The Tanodbayan was not independent but served at the pleasure of the president and could be removed at any time.\n\nAfter Marcos was overthrown in the 1986 People Power Revolution, Cory Aquino issued two Executive Orders (nos. 243 and 244) in July 1987 that established a new Office of the Ombudsman and transformed the Tanodbayan into the Office of the Special Prosecutor under the Ombudsman. Following the passage of the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman Act of 1989 was passed to define the roles and structure of the Office.\n\nThe Ombudsman and its subordinates are appointed by the President of the Philippines from a list submitted by the Judicial and Bar Council for a non-renewable seven-year term. The Ombudsman can be removed from office only through impeachment.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Somoto, Madriz. Son of Carlos Mejía Fajardo and María Elsa Godoy, his brother Luis Enrique Mejía Godoy, three years younger than he is, is also an acclaimed and much-loved musician. Carlos and Luis Enrique were pivotal in the New Song Movement in Central America beginning in the 1970s. They were both recently honored with Nicaragua's highest cultural distinction, the Order of Rubén Darío.\n\nCarlos started his career as 'Corporito' on the radio station 'Radio Corporacion', where he would daily compose songs that would rain ridicule and scorn on all politicians and political parties. He would do it with that biting sense of humor that so few artists are able to master.\n\nMany of his songs, performed with his band \"los de Palacagüina\", became associated with the Sandinista movement as songs of the workers and revolutionaries. He even composed a Mass for the working class, the \"Misa Campesina Nicaragüense\". Many of his songs during the late 1970s gave instructions on how to use, assemble, and disassemble the rifles people were capturing from dictator Somoza's National Guard during street battles.\n\nOne of his biggest achievements of his career as a songwriter came in 1977, when the song \"Quincho Barrilete\" (Quincho, the boy of the little barrel), composed by himself and performed by Eduardo Gonzalez won the sixth edition of the OTI Festival. A victory which is still remembered by many Nicaraguans.\n\nIn 1980, Carlos Mejía Godoy y los de Palancagüina were internally selected by Televicentro Nicaragua to represent their country in the OTI Festival in 1980 with their song \"La chavalita de España\" (The little girl from Spain). This song marked the return of Nicaragua to the event after two years of absence because of the turbulent Nicaraguan Revolution. Their competing song, which although was one of the favourites, ended in a respectable but disappointing tenth place with 15 points.\n\nHe was the vice-presidential running mate of Edmundo Jarquín of the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) in the November 2006 presidential election. They came in fourth place.\n\nMejía Godoy is the father of the United States Army deserter and author Camilo Mejía, as well as the musicians Carlos Luis 'La Bujilla' Mejía and Augusto 'El Negro' Mejía from the Grammy-nominated Nicaraguan ensemble La Cuneta Son Machín.\n\nSince 2018 he lives in Costa Rica. As one of president Daniel Ortega’s fiercest critics he feared being killed.\nSome of his albums include: , , , and .\n\nHis music has been featured on several compilations of songs of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan revolution: \"Songs of the Nicaraguan Revolution, Vol.1-2\", and \"Nicaraguita: Music from Nicaragua\". He was also featured in \"The Rough Guide to the Music of Central America\" (2002, World Music Network). Mejía Godoy was featured on the title track from La Cuneta Son Machín's \"Cañambuco\" (2017, Round Whirled Records).\n\nJefferson Starship recorded one of his songs for their 2008 album \"Jefferson's Tree of Liberty\"\n"}

{"id": "1866239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866239", "title": "Hurricane Isbell", "text": "Hurricane Isbell\n\nHurricane Isbell was the final hurricane to affect the United States during the 1964 season. The eleventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season. Isbell developed from a dissipating cold front in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 8. The depression initially remained disorganized as it track northwestward, but strengthened into Tropical Storm Isbell on October 13. Re-curving northeastward, Isbell quickly strengthened further and reached hurricane status by later that day. Late on October 13, Isbell made landfall in the Pinar del Río Province of Cuba. The storm continued strengthening and peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the following day. Isbell moved northeastward and made landfall near Everglades, Florida, late on October 14. After reaching the Atlantic on the following day, the storm began to weaken. Isbell turned northward and continued weakening, before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone while located just offshore eastern North Carolina on October 16.\n\nThe storm produced strong winds throughout western Cuba. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, as were several tobacco warehouses. There was at least $20 million in damage and four deaths in Cuba, three of them caused by collapsing houses in the Guane area. Several tornadoes in Florida caused significant damage. Throughout the state, 1 house was destroyed, 33 were severely damaged, and 631 suffered minor impact. Additionally, 66 trailers were destroyed and 88 were inflicted with major damage. Three deaths occurred in the state, one due to a heart attack and two from drowning in Florida Keys when their shrimp boat sank. Because the storm weakened considerably, impact in North Carolina was generally minor. The storm also spawned at least six tornadoes in the state, which demolished trailers and unroofed homes and other buildings in several communities. Damage throughout the United States totaled $10 million.\n\nHurricane Isbell was first identified as a weak tropical disturbance on October 7, 1964 over the western Caribbean Sea. Situated to the south of a diffuse trough, the system remained weak and relatively disorganized as it moved generally northwest near Honduras and Nicaragua. Despite the presence of an upper-level anticyclone, which promotes favorable outflow for tropical cyclones and aids in tropical cyclogenesis, a lack of distinct low-level inflow inhibited intensification. Additionally, an area of warm mid-tropospheric air was present within the cyclone. Though a disheveled system, it is analyzed to have become a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on October 8. The following day, the depression skirted the eastern coast of Honduras. Operationally, it was not until October 10 that the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on the depression. On that date, a weather reconnaissance mission into the system found a weak low-level circulation with a barometric pressure of 1007.3 mb (hPa; 29.75 inHg) and winds of 20–30 mph (30–45 km/h) in squalls. Throughout October 11 and 12, the depression slowly executed a tight cyclonic loop over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It finally organized into a tropical storm and was given the name \"Isbell\" by 00:00 UTC on October 13 after completing the loop and acquiring a north-northeast trajectory.\n\nThroughout October 13, marked intensification of the cyclone occurred. Over a 24‑hour span, ending at 18:00 UTC, its central pressure fell from 1005 mb (hPa; 29.68 inHg) to 979 mb (hPa; 28.91 inHg) which was reflected in Isbell's winds more than doubling from 35 mph (55 km/h) to 90 mph (150 km/h). Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall in extreme western Cuba, near Guane, before emerging over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Isbell's brief stint over land did not hinder development, which continued unabated until 12:00 UTC on October 14 at which time it reached its maximum intensity. Situated to the south of Key West, Florida, Isbell attained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) which ranks it as a Category 3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additionally, its central pressure bottomed out at 964 mb (hPa; 28.47 inHg). Around this time, a new low-pressure area formed to Isbell's northwest over the Gulf in response to a powerful cold-core low over the Mississippi Valley. The cyclonic flow of this second system brought cool, dry air from the north and circulated it into the hurricane. This in turn caused the storm to become asymmetric in structure with radar imagery indicating little to no reflectivity along the western periphery of the hurricane.\nThe degrading structure of Isbell resulted in some weakening as it accelerated toward Florida. At 22:00 UTC on October 14, the hurricane made landfall near Everglades City as a Category 2 with sustained winds between 100 and 110 mph (160 and 175 km/h). Within five hours, the system cleared the Florida Peninsula and emerged over the western Atlantic Ocean north of West Palm Beach. The storm's passage over land resulted in notable weakening, though Isbell remained of hurricane-strength. During the afternoon of October 15, the low that had formed the previous day induced a northward turn of the cyclone and directed it toward North Carolina, a result of what is known as the Fujiwhara effect. Thereafter, the two systems began to intertwine as Isbell began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone; rapid weakening accompanied this phase. Isbell completed this process by 12:00 UTC on October 16 as it moved onshore near Morehead City, North Carolina. On October 17 the two non-tropical systems merged into a single storm over the Outer Banks. Isbell's remnants emerged back over the Atlantic Ocean on October 18 near the Delmarva Peninsula before accelerating northeast. The system was last noted on October 19 as it moved over Atlantic Canada.\n\nIn Cuba, thousands were evacuated due to flooding lowlands. Advisories were broadcast and issued warning of the possibility of heavy rains and winds, isolated small hail, and possible isolated tornadoes in Florida from 21:00 UTC on October 14 to 02:00 UTC on October 15. The aviation severe weather forecast also warned residents in south and central Florida of up to of hail, gusts of up to , and the potential for tornadic activity. Flood warnings were also issued, with predictions of flooding above flood stage. Emergency preparations at Key West's weather office were made. In the morning hours of October 13, the office alerted city, county, and military officials. In the afternoon, they completed office preparations and scheduling. On October 14, the office requested radio stations to stay on the air and relayed hourly reports.\n\nIn North Carolina, some tidal flooding was also forecast. People were warned to tune to television and radio broadcasts. On October 15, as Isbell rapidly crossed Florida, forecasters at the Charleston, South Carolina Weather Bureau warned of high tides of up to , above flood-stage, from South Carolina into North Carolina. Owing to the continued northeastward movement of the storm, tides ultimately did not exceed in South Carolina. Across coastal areas of North Carolina, alerts for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and high tides were raised; however, the storm greatly diminished before reaching shore and little damage materialized. Moderate rains along the lower Neuse River basin were expected to prolong flooding triggered by Hurricane Hilda and its remnants earlier in October. Small craft advisories were raised northward to Provincetown, Massachusetts, through October 18.\n\nSkirting the extreme western coast of Cuba on October 13, the storm produced gusts estimated at in Pinar del Rio Province. The highest measured sustained winds were 85 mph (140 km/h) in Guane and 70 mph (110 km/h) at Rancho-Boyeros Airport in the capital city of Havana. Additionally, pressures at the city fell to 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91 inHg). Heavy rains caused rivers to over-top their banks, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. Three fatalities occurred in Guane due to collapsing homes. A fourth fatality took place elsewhere in Cuba. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm, with exact numbers unknown. The region's tobacco crop also sustained considerable losses with fields and warehouses destroyed. The damage to agriculture compounded economic losses in Cuba that resulted from Hurricane Flora in September 1963, which devastated the nation, as well as impacts from Hurricanes Cleo and Hilda earlier in 1964. The combined effects of Cleo, Hilda, and Isbell resulted in economic losses of approximately $100 million in the country, of which at least $20 million was directly attributed to Isbell.\n\nThough Isbell struck the state as a Category 2 hurricane, no winds in excess of 100 mph (160 km/h) were reported. Measurements peaked at 90 mph (150 km/h) at both Everglades City and Indiantown. Hurricane-force gusts were measured in Belle Glade, Fort Lauderdale, Key West, Pompano Beach, and West Palm Beach. Atmospheric pressures fell to 970.7 mb (hPa; 28.67 inHg) in the Dry Tortugas and 977.5 mb (hPa; 28.87 inHg) on the mainland in Juno Beach. Rainfall in the state was relatively limited owing to the brisk movement of the storm, though a frontal system immediately preceding the hurricane brought heavy rains to the state. A peak total of was measured in West Palm Beach, though an estimated 80% of this was attributable to the front. Amounts from the hurricane itself were likely around . No major storm surge was reported during Isbell's passage due to greatly weaker winds in the back half of the storm. Tides in Key West rose above normal.\n\nThroughout Florida, three people were killed in relation to the storm and no more than $10 million in damage occurred, with more than half of which was attributed to agricultural losses. In addition, 76 people were injured, 12 of whom required hospitalization. Structural damage was relatively limited, with only 63 homes and businesses, mostly trailers, being destroyed; 159 other structures sustained major damage while a further 631 experienced minor damage. The majority of damage from Isbell was not from the hurricane itself but rather tornadoes spawned by its outer bands. At least nine, and as many as twelve, tornadoes affected the state with the greatest effects being felt in the Miami metropolitan area. All storm-related injuries were attributed to these tornadoes as well as the majority of structural damage. According to the National Climatic Data Center, four of these tornadoes were of F2 intensity.\n\nDespite the close passage of the storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and amounted to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15 minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5 hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited the effects of the storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category 4 in September 1960.\n\nPalm Beach County was the most affected area, accounting for more than half of the losses, and approximately $700,000 in damage. One indirect death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack in Lake Worth while installing storm shutters. At least three tornadoes were spawned in Palm Beach County. The strongest was an F2 that struck a trailer park in Briny Breezes, damaging numerous trailers and injuring 22 people. Shortly thereafter the same tornado or possibly a second one struck Boynton Beach, injuring three people and damaging several structures. The event lasted roughly 20 minutes and the tornadoes moved along a path long. Another tornado in Boca Raton caused a number of minor injuries. In West Palm Beach, a twister that crossed the intersection of State Roads 802 and 809 damaged adjacent properties and injured several people. Throughout Palm Beach County, 492 homes suffered damage, while 36 mobile homes were demolished and 60 others were inflicted major impact. Additionally, 33 farm buildings and 9 small businesses were severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nIn Martin County, an F2 was spawned in Hobe Sound and affected the area near U.S. Route 1. About 39 homes and 13 mobile homes were damaged, while two farm buildings and two businesses also received impact. The fourth F2 tornado was spawned in Brevard County near Eau Gallie. It caused extensive damage and injured 17 people in the Orange Court trailer park. Collectively, 35 homes in Flagler and Volusia counties were damaged.\n\nHeavy rains associated with Isbell and a nearby non-tropical low resulted in heavy rains across The Carolinas on October 15 and 16. In and around the Columbia, South Carolina area, of rain fell, with a peak of in the city itself. Significant flooding took place along all rivers in the state; the Broad River crested at , its highest level since 1940, in Blair. The Pee Dee River rose to at Cheraw by October 18, roughly above flood-stage. The cotton crop sustained the greatest losses during the event, with damage estimated in excess of $1 million. Along the coast, tides rose to , above normal, in Charleston Harbor. What little coastal flooding took place mostly resulted from wave run-up rather than tidal flooding. Some beach erosion occurred in exposed areas.\n\nMuch of North Carolina was affected by Isbell with rain extending into interior parts of the state. Totals were generally light, however, and peaked at around in eastern areas. Some flash flooding took place in the Piedmont, though overall effects were minimal. In the Blue Ridge Mountains, the French Broad River topped its banks and prompted evacuations in Hot Springs and Marshall. The greatest impacts were felt along the Neuse River in Kinston within Lenoir County. Rains from Isbell exacerbated ongoing floods in the area, resulting in heavy damage to many homes. A man was swept away by swift currents near a Duke Energy steam plant in Cliffside; however, it is unknown if he perished or was later rescued. Losses to the peanut crop were extensive, though no monetary value is available. With the storm arriving at low-tide, no notable coastal flooding occurred. The significant weakening of Isbell prior to landfall also lessened the effects from wind as gale-force winds were mostly constrained to coastal areas; a peak gust of 75 mph (120 km/h) was measured in Elizabeth City.\n\nElsewhere along the East Coast, the remnants of Isbell produced generally light to moderate rain. A localized maximum of around occurred in Massachusetts as the system began to dissipate.

Tsui also directed four of the films and co-wrote the first five as well as an episode of the television series.\n\nThe films and the series recount fictional exploits and aventures of real life Chinese martial arts master and folk hero of Cantonese ethnicity, Wong Fei-hung, who is portrayed by Jet Li in the first three and the final film and Vincent Zhao in the fourth and fifth films and the TV series, his apprentices Leung Foon, Kwai Geuk-Chat and Lam Sai-wing, and his love interest Siu-kwan, a fictional character created for the series and played by Rosamund Kwan in the films and Maggie Shiu on television.\n\nThe first two films in the franchise were among the most popular of the Golden Age of Hong Kong cinema (usually dated from 1986 to 1993) and were known for their depiction of Chinese nationalism as well as action choreography. The \"Once Upon a Time in China\" films were among Jet Li's best known hits at that time.\n\nWith Chinese folk hero of Cantonese ethnicity, Wong Fei-hung, as the main character, the films deal with the positive and negative effects of Western imperialism in China during the late Qing Dynasty. The second film features as a supporting character Sun Yat-sen, a revolutionary leader and founding father of the Chinese republic. Unlike the majority of Hong Kong action films, the \"Once Upon a Time in China\" series is clearly politicised. However, even with its clear showcase of Chinese nationalism, it also displays the inevitable nature of accepting western cultures, and the progression of China into the \"modern\" century. This theme is repeated through various actions of the characters, but prominently displayed through the character Master Yim in the first movie. He is a Kung-Fu master, but the likes of him are dwindling and barely making a livelihood. Once, he boasts that his Kung-Fu can even withstand bullets. In irony, he is killed by the onslaught of bullets fired by American soldiers. In his last words, he tells Wong Fei-Hung, \"Martial arts cannot win against guns...\" His character represents the dying of old traditions, and the begrudging abandonment of hand-to-hand combat.\n\n\nIn addition to the various individual DVD releases, the first three films in the series have been released in a number of collection box sets.\n\n\nAs imitation was relatively common in the Hong Kong film industry, \"Once Upon a Time in China\" quickly gained mimics. Whilst these films also focused on Wong Fei-hung, they were not part of the series, and had different cast members and directors. They include:\n\n\nHowever, one imitator had more direct links with the original series, \"Last Hero in China\" (黃飛鴻之鐵雞鬥蜈蚣).\nThis film was released in 1993 after the original \"Once Upon a Time in China\" trilogy. It is derivative of these films, and unlike other imitation films, it can be considered a spin-off or parody to some extent. It was directed by Wong Jing in place of Tsui Hark. The film's action director was Yuen Woo-ping and once again it starred Jet Li as Wong Fei-hung. However it differs greatly in tone from the \"Once Upon a Time in China\" series, containing stronger elements of violence and broader slapstick comedy.\n\n"}

In that year, there were 91,000 visitors. The primary task of STPB was to coordinate the efforts of hotels, airlines and travel agents to develop the fledgling tourism industry of the country.\n\nLater, STPB began to initiate new marketing ideas to promote Singapore's image abroad. The board created the Merlion, a symbol based on a Singapore mythical legend, that became an icon of the Singapore destination. The board has also been providing travel agent licensing and tourist guide training.\n\nSTPB actively promoted the development of infrastructure, including the building of hotels and tourist attractions such as the Jurong Bird Park and Sentosa which is now a popular resort island for both tourists and local visitors. The board also markets the city as a convention venue and organises events to attract visitors.\n\nIn the 1980s, several historic and culturally significant areas such as Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam were earmarked for preservation. These places express Singapore's cultural diversity and became popular tourist destinations. The Singapore River underwent a major cleanup program and the areas along the river were developed for restaurants and other tourist amenities.\n\nThe board was renamed as Singapore Tourism Board in 1997.\n\nPast Chairmen\n\nPast CEOs\n\nThe board now oversees all aspects of tourism, including resource allocation and long-term strategic planning.

A third of this amount will be used to assist the industry to build manpower competencies through education and skills-upgrading initiatives, particularly in key areas such as conference management.\n\nSingapore tourism industry has grown rapidly since STPB was set up. In 2004, there were 8 million visitors. On 11 January 2005, Minister for Trade and Industry unveiled the Singapore Tourism Board’s (STB) targets to doubling visitor arrivals to 17 million by 2015.\n\nIn March 2010, the STB projected a 20-30% increase in visitor arrivals for the year. 2010 would see the much awaited opening of both the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. This coincided with other key events such as the FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. These offerings were expected to enhance Singapore’s status as a dynamic global city and increase visitor arrivals. The changes in Singapore's landscape would also continue beyond 2010. New developments such as the International Cruise Terminal, Gardens by the Bay and Changi Motor Sports Hub are expected to be unveiled in the coming years.\n\n\n"}

As a director, he was associated with the British production companies Amicus and Hammer in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBorn in Islington in London, England, Francis originally planned to become an engineer. At school, a piece he wrote about films of the future won him a scholarship to the North West London Polytechnic in Kentish Town. He left school at age 16, becoming an apprentice to photographer Louis Prothero. Francis stayed with Prothero for six months. In this time they photographed stills for a Stanley Lupino picture made at Associated Talking Pictures (later Ealing Studios). This led to his successively becoming a clapper boy, camera loader and focus puller. He began his career in films at British International Pictures, then moved to British and Dominions. His first film as a clapper boy was \"The Prisoner of Corbal\" (1936).\n\nIn 1939, Francis joined the Army, where he would spend the next seven years. Eventually he was assigned as cameraman and director to the Army Kinematograph Service at Wembley Studios, where he worked on many training films. About this, Francis said \"Most of the time I was with various film units within the service, so I got quite a bit of experience in all sorts of jobs, including being a cameraman and editing and generally being a jack of all trades.\"\n\nFollowing his return to civilian life, Francis spent the next 10 years working as a camera operator. Films he worked on during this period include \"The Elusive Pimpernel\" (1950), \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" (1951), \"Beat the Devil\" (1953), and \"Moby Dick\" (1956); he was a frequent collaborator with cinematographers Christopher Challis (nine films) and Oswald Morris (five films). His first feature with Morris was \"Golden Salamander\" (1950).\n\nFrancis was on the second unit of \"Moby Dick\". He became a main unit director of photography on \"A Hill in Korea\" (1956), which was shot in Portugal. He subsequently worked on such prestige pictures as \"Room at the Top\" (1959), \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (1960), \"Sons and Lovers\" (1960), and \"The Innocents\" (1961), which he regarded as one of the best films he shot.\n\nFrancis received many industry awards, including, in 1997, an international achievement award from the American Society of Cinematographers, and in 2004, BAFTA's special achievement award.\n\nFollowing his Academy Award win for \"Sons and Lovers\", Francis began his career as director of feature films. His first feature as director was \"Two and Two Make Six\" (1962). For the next 20-plus years, Francis worked continuously as a director of low-budget films, most of them in the genres of horror or psycho-thriller.\n\nBeginning with \"Paranoiac\" (1963), Francis made numerous films for Hammer throughout the 1960s and 1970s. These films included thrillers like \"Nightmare\" (1964) and \"Hysteria\" (1965), as well as monster films such as \"The Evil of Frankenstein\" (1964) and \"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave\" (1968). On his apparent typecasting as a director of these types of film, Francis said \"Horror films have liked me more than I have liked horror films\".\n\nAlso in the mid 1960s, Francis began an association with Amicus Productions, another studio like Hammer which specialised in horror pictures. Most of the films Francis made for Amicus were anthologies such as \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" (1965), \"Torture Garden\" (1968) and \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1972). He also did two films for the short-lived company Tyburn films. These were \"The Ghoul\" (1975) and \"Legend of the Werewolf\" (1975). As a director, Francis was more than competent, and his horror films possessed an undeniable visual flair. However, he regretted that he was seldom able to move beyond genre material as a director. Francis directed the little-seen \"Son of Dracula\" (1974), starring Harry Nilsson in the title role and Ringo Starr as Merlin the Magician. Of the films Francis directed, one of his favorites was \"Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny, and Girly\" (1970). \"Mumsy...\" was a black comedy about an isolated, upper-class family whose relationships and behaviors came equipped with deadly consequences. The film was not very well-received by mainstream critics, but has gone on to become a minor cult favorite among fans. In 1985, Francis directed \"The Doctor and the Devils\", based on the crimes of Burke and Hare.\n\nFrancis's last film as director was 1987's \"Dark Tower\" (no relation to the 2004 book of the same name by Stephen King). Francis thought it was a bad picture owing to poor special effects and had his name taken off it. His name was substituted with the name Ken Barnett. Francis is featured in the book \"Conversations with Cinematographers\" (2012) by David A Ellis and published by American publisher Scarecrow Press.\n\nWith \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), directed by David Lynch, Francis gained new-found industry and critical respect as a cinematographer. During the 1980s, he worked on films such as \"The Executioner's Song\" (1982), \"Dune\" (1984) and \"Glory\" (1989), which earned him his second Academy Award. Francis provided the cinematography for the critical favorite \"The Man in the Moon\" as well as Martin Scorsese's remake of \"Cape Fear\" (both 1991). His final film as cinematographer was David Lynch's \"The Straight Story\" (1999), which was shot on location in Iowa in 23 days. One of his favorite camera operators was Gordon Hayman. He made several films with him including the \"Cape Fear\" remake and \"Glory\", but Hayman was left off the credits for the later film by mistake.\n\nFreddie Francis married Gladys Dorrell in 1940, with whom he had a son; in 1963 he married Pamela Mann Francis, with whom he had a daughter and a second son.\n\nHe died at age 89 as the result of the lingering effects of a stroke. His son Kevin Francis is a film producer.\n\n\n"}

It was well known for giving away posters in the centre of the paper (initially black and white, but colour from late 1971) and later for covering heavy metal (especially the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM)) and Oi! music in its late 1970s–early 1980s heyday.\n\n\"Sounds\" was one of the first music papers to cover punk. Mick Middles covered the Manchester music scene for \"Sounds\" from 1978 to 1982 writing about many of the up and coming bands of the time from Buzzcocks and Slaughter & The Dogs to The Fall (band) and Joy Division. John Robb (musician) joined in 1987 and came up with the term \"Britpop\". The paper's editors realised the importance of its regional audience and had freelancers across the UK contributing gig reviews and articles about up-and-coming local bands.\n\nKeith Cameron wrote about Nirvana after Robb carried out the first ever interview with them. Frontman Kurt Cobain was often seen wearing a \"Sounds\" shirt.\n\nOne of the trinity of British music weeklies, along with \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\", \"Sounds\" folded in 1991 after the parent company, United Newspapers, sold all their music titles to EMAP Metro. Morgan-Grampian had been acquired by United Business Media – then known as United News and Media – in 1987, first as part of the United Advertising Publications (UAP) division and later as part of the then CMP Information portfolio. \nA legacy of \"Sounds\" was the creation of the heavy metal/rock magazine \"Kerrang!\", which was originally issued as a supplement before being spun off as a separate publication.\n\nContributors included Garry Bushell, Mick Middles, Geoff Barton, John Robb, Mick Sinclair, Caroline Coon, Antonella Gambotto, Vivien Goldman, Jonh Ingham, Alan Moore (a.k.a. \"Curt Vile\"), Lizo Mzimba, John Peel, Barbara Charone, Edwin Pouncey (a.k.a. \"Savage Pencil\"), Cathi Unsworth, Jon Ronson, Jon Savage, Sylvie Simmons, Penny Valentine, Marguerite Van Cook, Mary Anne Hobbs, Mat Snow, James Brown (who went on to form \"Loaded\"), Andy Ross (who wrote as \"Andy Hurt\" and went on to form Food Records), Steve Lamacq, Kev F.

He appears in 148 episodes of the franchise (111 episodes of \"Law & Order\" and 36 episodes of \"\") as well as in one episode of \"\". He also appeared in \"\".\n\nLogan initially appeared on \"Law & Order\" from the show's pilot episode. He appeared in every episode beginning with the first season in 1990 until Noth's dismissal from the series in 1995. After appearing in the franchise telemovie \"Exiled\", the character then guest-starred in the \"\" season-four episode \"Stress Position\". Logan subsequently became a regular on \"Criminal Intent\", starting with the first episode of season five, \"\", which originally aired on September 25, 2005. Logan then left the series in the 21st episode of season seven, \"\", which originally aired on August 17, 2008.\n\nMike Logan was born in 1958 in New York City's Lower East Side into a working-class Irish-Catholic family. His father was also a police officer. He spent 10 years attending Our Lady of Mercy, where he was often in trouble and sent to see the guidance counselor. Little is revealed about his extended family, but he has stated that his family crest has a griffin on it, suggesting a European maternal line distinct from that of his surname. He is originally portrayed as a cocky, womanizing misanthrope with a short fuse, which his captain, Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), refers to as his \"famous temper\". Later episodes, however, reveal a more complex side to the character; gradually he is revealed have to been abused as a child, both physically (by his unstable, alcoholic mother) and sexually (by his parish priest, whom he later confronts and brings to justice). These early traumas lead to his rather cynical view of the church; he quips in one episode, \"My old lady had a rosary in her left hand while she beat the crap out of me with her right. The next time I go to church, six of my closest buddies will be carrying me.\" When he was a young man, his pregnant girlfriend had an abortion against his wishes.\n\nIn several episodes, his anger explodes. When his first partner, Max Greevey (George Dzundza), is murdered by a suspect in a racketeering case, Logan forces a confession from the murderer at gunpoint, and comes very close to killing him. The incident nearly costs Logan his job. He eventually learns to accept Greevey's death, however, with help from police psychiatrist Elizabeth Olivet (Carolyn McCormick). He and Olivet become close, and it is later implied that they had a brief relationship.\n\nLogan's second partner, Phil Cerreta (Paul Sorvino), is also shot in the line of duty, but he survives and takes on a desk job. For the rest of the character's tenure on the show, Logan is partnered with Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach), with whom he forms a close friendship.\n\nLogan has professed an intense dislike for upper-class professions, especially lawyers, accounting for his antagonistic relationship with EADA Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston). He has diverse political views; he is adamantly pro-choice, favors drug legalization, and compares the Patriot Act to George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". While he has at various points harbored prejudices against people of Arabic and Japanese descent, by 2007, he shows unbridled disdain towards any form of racism.\n\nWhen Noth was fired from the show in 1995 over a salary dispute, the Logan character was written out; in the \"Law & Order\" universe, Logan is transferred from Manhattan Homicide to the Staten Island Domestic Disputes squad in 1995 for publicly punching a homophobic politician who had been tried for the murder of a gay man (based on the Dan White case). The transfer is considered a punishment and a career dead end for Logan; Briscoe refers to Logan's new assignment as \"doing 5 to 10 in Staten Island\". He is replaced by Det. Rey Curtis (Benjamin Bratt).\n\nThe Logan character was revived in 1998 and given his own TV movie, \"Exiled: A Law & Order Movie\". By the time of the movie, Logan has become a homicide detective again, but is still in Staten Island. He tries to get back to Manhattan by solving the murder of a prostitute, in the process discovering that his old friend, Detective Tony Profaci (John Fiore), is involved in the crime.\n\nIn 2005, the character was added to \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\". He was reintroduced in the fourth-season episode \"Stress Position\", where he helps the Major Case Squad's investigation of a case of prisoner abuse involving corrupt corrections officers who torture Arab prisoners. Detectives Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe) question Logan's girlfriend, prison nurse Gina Lowe (Arija Bareikis), about prison drug testing and her interactions with a murdered corrections officer. Later, the detectives deduce that Unit Counselor Kurt Plumm (Wayne Duvall) is the ringleader and is planning to have Lowe killed to silence her; Goren and Logan attempt to escort her to safety, but the prison goes into lockdown, trapping all three inside. Plumm and his partners corner Logan, Goren, and Lowe in a corridor. Goren convinces the other guards to defy Plumm, however, and one of the officers opens the gates to free the detectives and Lowe. Logan picks up a guard's discarded billy club and approaches Plumm menacingly, but he resists the urge to assault the man. \"That guy,\" Logan later says to Goren, \"he would have been worth another 10 years in Staten Island.\" Also in the episode, Captain James Deakins (Jamey Sheridan) reveals that Logan's former superior officer, Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), had tried three times to get him transferred back to her command after his reassignment, all to no avail.\n\nLogan returns to Manhattan as a detective at the Major Case Squad in the fifth season (under Deakins' directive), promoted to senior partner with Det. Carolyn Barek (Annabella Sciorra). In the 2006 episode \"\", he uses deadly force against a murder suspect, unaware that the man is an undercover police officer. He is cleared of official misconduct, but is troubled by having killed a fellow officer; he reaches out to Olivet for counseling.\n\nLogan's shooting of the undercover officer sets in motion a chain of events that eventually leads to Deakins' retirement from the NYPD. In the sixth season, the Major Case Squad is handed over to a new captain, Danny Ross (Eric Bogosian), and Logan is assigned a new partner, Det. Megan Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson).\n\nAt the end of the sixth season, while Wheeler goes on temporary assignment (due to Nicholson's first pregnancy), Logan begins dating his neighbor Holly Lauren (Kelli Williams), but she is murdered before the relationship can develop. During the investigation, Logan discovers that Lauren had a whole other life. Her name used to be Kathleen Shaw and she was running from an abusive ex-boyfriend, who becomes a person of interest in her death. When District Attorney Arthur Branch (Fred Dalton Thompson) drops charges against Lauren's ex, Julian (Alec Von Bargen), due to lack of evidence of a homicide, Logan is deeply upset.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season, he has a new partner, Detective Nola Fallaci (Alicia Witt), who is assigned to him from Brooklyn North homicide, while Wheeler is teaching American police procedures to officers in Europe.\n\nIn the episode \"\", Logan goes head to head with Terri Driver (Leslie Hope), a corrupt ADA who had made her career by railroading defendants she had cause to believe were innocent. Driver, who is running for attorney general, threatens to go after Logan's job and builds a case against Wheeler's fiancé, who is arrested by the FBI for fraud and racketeering. Logan solves a 16-year-old homicide that Driver has been trying to bury and exonerates a man she unjustly sent to prison, but the inflexibility and corruption of the justice system he sees in this case leaves him angry and disenchanted. A priest who first put Logan on the case advises him that, after over 25 years as a cop, it is time to do other things with his life. Logan nods his head and walks out of the room, but his decision is not revealed until the following season, when Ross mentions to Wheeler that her partner “quit on her”, referring to Logan. He is replaced by Zack Nichols (Jeff Goldblum).\n\nMike Logan carries a Smith & Wesson Model 36 .38 Special caliber revolver in the original \"Law & Order\" series. In \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\", he still carried the Model 36 in his early appearances, but he later switches to a Glock 19 9mm semiautomatic pistol before moving to a Colt Detective Special, another .38 caliber revolver.\n\nIn the precredit sequence of the 1995 \"\" episode \"Law & Disorder\", Mike Logan hands off a prisoner (John Waters) to Baltimore Detective Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher), while they engage in friendly banter about which city, New York or Baltimore, is better. Noth was uncredited for his appearance, but received a special thanks.\n\nAlong with the rest of the cast of \"Law & Order\", Chris Noth was nominated for a Screen Actor's Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 1995 and 1996. Noth was also nominated for a Viewers for Quality Television Award for his performance as Logan in 1994.\n\nNoth has appeared in 111 episodes in \"Law & Order\" and 36 episodes in \"\".\n"}

It was a special award be given to all Nazi Party members who had, as of 9 November 1933, registered numbers from 1 to 100,000 and unbroken Party membership. Other Golden Party Badges (with the initials 'A.H.' stamped on the reverse) were awarded at the discretion of Hitler to certain members of the party who merited special treatment. An identical badge was awarded each year on 30 January to persons who had shown outstanding service to the Nazi Party or State. Only 20,487 men and 1,795 women were actually approved for and awarded the badge (outside of the ones Hitler awarded at his discretion).\n\nThe Golden Party Badge was the basic Nazi Party Badge with the addition of a gold wreath completely encircling the badge. The badge was awarded in two sizes: 30.5 mm for wearing on service uniforms and 24 mm for wearing on a suit jacket. In the event of the death of the recipient, the badge would be kept by the family. However, due to the numbered certificate, no one else was allowed to wear the badge.\n\nAdolf Hitler's own Golden Party Badge had the number '1'. However, his actual Party number was 555, as the numbers started at 500 to make the party's membership at the time, appear larger. He awarded his Golden Party Badge to Magda Goebbels in late April 1945 and proclaimed her as the \"First Mother of the Reich\". The '1' badge was stolen from a display in Russia in 2005. The guards thought that a cat had set off the alarms and this allowed the burglar to escape with the badge.\n\nIn the 1930s, Rudolf Hess had explored the possibility of making the Golden Nazi Party Badge the first degree of a multi-degree award of the German Order. In Hess' proposal, the Golden Nazi Party Badge would have been the lowest degree, followed by a 2nd class medal, 1st class cross, and then a Knight's Cross neck order. Hess's degrees were never bestowed, but the German Order retained the Golden Nazi Party Badge as its centerpiece.\n\n"}

This provides the framework to tell five horror stories.\n\n\nArchitect Jim Dawson (Neil McCallum) returns to his old family home on a Scottish isle to make renovations for the new owner, Mrs. Biddulph (Ursula Howells). Biddulph explains she bought the secluded house to help her recover from the death of her husband. \n\nDawson finds the coffin of Count Cosmo Valdemar behind a fake wall in the cellar. Valdemar, the original owner of the house, was killed in a conflict with the Dawson family centuries ago. Local legend states that Valdemar would reclaim his former home and take revenge on the current owner. Dawson discovers that Valdemar is rising at night as a werewolf, and has already killed a housemaid (Katy Wild). \n\nBelieving Mrs. Biddulph to be in danger, he makes silver bullets out of an ancestral cross that protected the house against Valdemar's spirit. When the wolf appears, Dawson is baffled that the bullets don't kill it. Mrs. Biddulph explains that she has replaced the silver bullets with ordinary ones. She reveals to Dawson that the truth of the legend is that Valdemar will take revenge on the last descendant of the Dawson clan, and placing a Dawson corpse in Valdemar's coffin will restore Valdemar to life in human form. It was all a trap: Biddulph is Valdemar's wife, who has returned from the grave after 200 years.\n\n\nBill Rogers (Alan Freeman) and his wife and daughter (Ann Bell and Sarah Nicholls) return from vacation to discover a fast-growing vine in the garden. When the plant seems to respond violently to attempts to cut it down, Rogers goes to the Ministry of Defence, where he gets advice from a couple of scientists (played by Bernard Lee and Jeremy Kemp). The plant becomes intelligent, and harbours homicidal tendencies towards any threats to its existence.\n\n\nBiff Bailey (Roy Castle) is a jazz musician who accepts a gig in the West Indies, and foolishly steals a tune from a local voodoo ceremony. When he tries to use the tune as a melody in a jazz composition back in London, there are dire consequences. Running from an unknown force, Bailey stumbles against a wall where there is a garish poster for \"Dr Terror's House of Horrors\". This story is probably based on the short story \"Papa Benjamin\" by Cornell Woolrich, which was also adapted by the television series \"Thriller\" and the radio series \"Suspense\". The quintet of British jazz saxophonist Tubby Hayes appears as Bailey's backing band.\n\n\nPompous art critic Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) seems more concerned with his own devastating wit than art itself. Painter Eric Landor (Michael Gough) bears the brunt of one of Marsh's tirades, but gets even by humiliating the critic publicly. When Landor takes it too far, Marsh responds by driving over him with his car, causing Landor to lose one of his hands. Unable to paint any more, Landor commits suicide. Marsh is then tormented by the disembodied hand, which seems immune to fire as well as attempts to contain it, leading to Marsh's eventual blindness in a car accident of his own.\n\n\nDr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) returns to his home in the United States with his new French bride, Nicolle (Jennifer Jayne). Soon there is evidence that a vampire is on the loose, and Carroll seeks the aid of his colleague, Dr Blake (Max Adrian). They find that Nicolle is the vampire. Following Blake's advice, Carroll kills Nicolle. When the police come to arrest Carroll for his wife's murder, Blake denies giving any such advice. As the police take Carroll away, Blake says to himself that the city isn't big enough for two doctors or two vampires, and he turns into a bat.\n\n\nThe frame story ends with a twist. Dr. Schreck informs the men that the only way they can avoid these horrible destinies is by dying first. When the train stops, the men find out that they are already dead, having perished in a train crash while their fortunes were being told. Schreck is revealed to be Death himself.\n\n\"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" was a conscious attempt by Milton Subotsky to repeat the success of \"Dead of Night\" (1945). Subotsky considered that movie to be \"the greatest horror film ever,\" and used it as a blueprint for \"Dr. Terror\" and the rest of Amicus's portmanteau films. The script began as a stillborn television series in 1948 during the time when \"Dead of Night\" was a recent release. Subotsky wrote the original stories in 1948 when he was employed as a scriptwriter for NBC's \"Lights Out\" series.\n\nFilming began on \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1964 with a budget of £105,000 and was completed on 3 July 1964. It was released on 5 February 1965.\n\nDonald Sutherland was paid £1,000 ($10,153.31 in 2018 dollars) for his performance.\n\nIt was filmed using the cinematic process known as Techniscope.\n\nIn a contemporary review, \"Variety\" noted \"a usefully chilly package deal which will offer audiences several mild shudders and quite a lot of amusement. Even though occasional giggles set in, the cast, headed by experienced horror practitioners such as Peter Cushing, Michael Gough, Christopher Lee and Max Adrian, sensibly play it straight.\" Chris Coffel from Bloody Disgusting called the film \"an Underrated Horror Anthology\", and commended the film's cinematography. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866292", "title": "Boq", "text": "Boq\n\nBoq is a minor character in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum. He becomes a more prominent character in Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel \"\", which purports to show the lives of some of Baum's characters from another perspective, and more prominent still in the 2003 Broadway musical \"Wicked\" which is based on Maguire's novel.\n\nIn Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", Boq is a rich Munchkin man who lives in the eastern quadrant called Munchkin Country in the Land of Oz. He gladly provides shelter for Dorothy and her dog Toto on their first night in Oz while on their journey to the Emerald City. Though the novel initially depicts Dorothy meeting only three local Munchkin men when she first encounters the Good Witch of the North upon her unexpected arrival, she does come across a lavish banquet at Boq's Munchkin mansion while on the Yellow Brick Road (consisting of his family, his closest friends and five fiddlers) celebrating the demise of the Wicked Witch of the East. They welcome Dorothy as a guest of honor and thank her for freeing them. Boq is very impressed when he sees Dorothy is wearing the charmed Silver Shoes the Wicked Witch had owned and even waits upon her himself, offering her fruit, nuts, cakes, pies and several other scrumptious treats. He is also the one who informs her that the favorite color of the Munchkin people is blue and that only good witches and sorceresses wear white. With the combination of white and faded blue checks in Dorothy's gingham dress, this implies to them that she is a friendly witch, even though Dorothy knows she is just an ordinary little girl from Kansas. After the celebration, Boq gives Dorothy and Toto a comfortable bed to sleep in. In the morning when Dorothy eats a hearty breakfast, Boq admits to Dorothy at the dining table that he has never been to the Emerald City and does not know exactly how far away that it is, for he believes that no one should ever go there unless one has business with the great and powerful Oz.\n\nIn \"Dorothy of Oz\", Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and China Doll Princess arrive in the Munchkin Village where they meet up with Boq. When Dorothy tells him that Toto is a prisoner of the Jester at Princess Gaylette's castle, Boq tells Dorothy that it has been raining for several months and that much of Munchkin County is underwater enough to put the Yellow Brick Road into a state of disrepair. Boq tells the group that the secret of the Yellow Brick Road involved the Wizard of Oz having the Good Witch of the North use magical ingredients to make it where it had the color of sunlight even when it rains for a short time. Following a break in the storm, Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Boq headed to where Dorothy's house landed when she first arrived in the Land of Oz. While there, the group encounters the Queen of the Field Mice who mentioned that the constant rains have forced the Field Mice out of their burrows and even detect the presence of the Wicked Witch of the East's ghost. After a part of the Yellow Brick Road is put back in place and the Wicked Witch of the East's ghost disappears, the Munchkins and the Field Mice celebrate the spell being broken as Dorothy's group boards Tugg and heads down the Munchkin River once more.\n\nIn Maguire's novel, Boq is a childhood friend of Elphaba and a classmate of hers at Shiz University, where he assists her in doing research for Doctor Dillamond. He is the point-of-view character for several chapters in a section of the book. Boq becomes friends with Crope, Tibbett, and Avaric, although he appears to be jealous of Avaric's good looks, charm, and money. His infatuation with Galinda, which never comes to more than a brief kiss, gradually lifts and they become friends. Boq eventually marries Milla, one of Galinda's classmates at Crage Hall. The two wed and return to Boq's Munchkinland farm. Elphaba encounters Boq not long after Nessarose's funeral, as she inquires after Dorothy, and again after her assault on Madame Morrible.\n\nIn the musical, Boq is the love interest of Elphaba's younger sister, Nessarose (who would later become the Wicked Witch of the East). However, the feeling is not mutual; Boq only became involved with Nessarose in hopes of impressing Galinda, on whom he truly has his heart set. Unfortunately, Galinda has so little regard for him that she cannot remember his name (calling him Biq). When Nessarose eventually becomes the governor of Munchkinland, she uses her power to enslave Boq as her personal servant. When Boq confesses his love for Glinda, Nessarose becomes extremely angry with him. At that point, she casts a spell on him from Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmrie, but mispronounces it. This causes Boq's heart to shrink until it is completely gone. In a desperate attempt to save Boq's life, Elphaba turns Boq into the Tin Woodman. Unlike in the novel, Boq plays a considerably condensed role in the stage production.\n\nIn the original Broadway production, he was played by Christopher Fitzgerald. Originally in the West End, James Gillan played the role.\n\nIn the season 5, episode \"Our Decay\" Boq has a minor appearance when the Wicked Witch, Zelena, kills him by turning him into dust to find out who told Dorothy to return to Oz to defeat her.\n"}

{"id": "1866305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866305", "title": "Minneapolis general strike of 1934", "text": "Minneapolis general strike of 1934\n\nThe Minneapolis general strike of 1934 grew out of a strike by Teamsters against most of the trucking companies operating in Minneapolis, the major distribution center for the Upper Midwest. The strike began on May 16, 1934 in the Market District (the modern day Warehouse District). The worst single day was \nFriday, July 20, called \"Bloody Friday\", when police shot at strikers in a downtown truck battle, killing two and injuring 67. Ensuing violence lasted periodically throughout the summer. The strike was formally ended on August 22.\n\nWith a coalition formed by local leaders associated with the Trotskyist Communist League of America, a group that later founded the Socialist Workers Party (United States), the strike paved the way for the organization of over-the-road drivers and the growth of the Teamsters labor union. This strike, along with the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike and the 1934 Toledo Auto-Lite Strike led by the American Workers Party, were also important catalysts for the rise of industrial unionism in the 1930s, much of which was organized through the Congress of Industrial Organizations.\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters, under the leadership of Daniel Tobin in 1933, was a conservative union averse to strikes. While the union's members were often called on to support other unions' strikes, since their role in transport brought them in contact with workers in many other unionized industries, and had developed strong traditions of solidarity in some areas, the International Union itself was cautious to the point of having resistance to striking whatsoever. The provisions of the International Constitution that required a two thirds vote of the membership to authorize any strike action and that gave the International President the power to withhold strike benefits if he believed that a local union had struck prematurely, It also divided its members into separate unions along craft or industry lines: ice wagon drivers in one local, produce drivers in another, milk drivers in a third, and so forth.\n\nThe Teamsters also had a number of general locals; Local 574 in Minneapolis, which had no more than 75 members in 1934, was one of them. A number of militant members, including several Communist Party members who had gone to the newly formed Communist League of America (Left Opposition) in the internal split following Trotsky's expulsion, became members of Local 574 in the early 1930s.\n\nThese militants – Ray Dunne, his brothers Miles and Grant, Carl Skoglund and later Farrell Dobbs – began by organizing coal drivers through a strike in the coldest part of 1933 that ignored both the cumbersome approval procedures established under the International's Constitution and the ineffective mediation procedures offered under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The victory gave the union a great deal of credibility among both drivers and their employers. The union began organizing drivers wherever they could be found.\n\nThe union also began preparing for the strike in a number of ways. It rented a large hall that could be used as a strike headquarters, kitchen and infirmary. It organized a women's auxiliary to staff the headquarters. Finally, it entered into discussions with the sympathetic leaders of organizations of farmers and the unemployed to obtain their support for the upcoming strike.\n\nThe strike began on May 16, 1934. The strike was remarkably effective, shutting down most commercial transport in the city with the exception of certain farmers, who were allowed to bring their produce into town, but delivering directly to grocers, rather than to the market area, which the union had shut down.\n\nThe market was to be the scene of the fiercest fighting during the earliest part of the strike. On Saturday, May 19, 1934, Minneapolis Police and private guards beat a number of strikers trying to prevent strikebreakers from unloading a truck in that area and waylaid several strikers who had responded to a report that scab drivers were unloading newsprint at the two major dailies' loading docks. When those injured strikers were brought back to the strike headquarters the police followed; the strikers, however, not only refused to let the police into the headquarters, but left two of them unconscious on the sidewalk outside.\n\nFighting intensified the following Monday, May 21, when the police, augmented by several hundred newly deputized members of the Citizens Alliance, an employer organization, attempted to open up the market for trucking. Fighting began when a loaded truck began leaving a loading dock. The battle became a general melee when hundreds of pickets armed with clubs of all sorts rushed to the area to support the picketers; when the police drew their guns as if to shoot, the union sent a truck loaded with picketers into the mass of police and deputies in order to make it impossible for them to fire without shooting each other.\n\nOther unions, particularly in the building trades, began to strike in sympathy with the Teamsters. The American Federation of Labor's Central Labor Council in Minneapolis offered financial and moral support for the strike, allowing the union to coordinate some of its picketing activities from its headquarters.\n\nThe fighting resumed on Tuesday, May 22. The picketers took the offensive and succeeded in driving both police and deputies from the market and the area around the union's headquarters. Of the several hundred deputized \"special police\", two (C. Arthur Lyman and Peter Erath) were cornered and killed. In the following \"general riot\" another roughly two dozen special police, municipal police, and strikers were beaten or wounded.\n\nThe Central Labor Council, the Building Trades Council and the Teamsters Joint Council approached Mike Johannes, the Minneapolis Chief of Police, to propose a truce, under which the local would cease picketing for twenty-four hours if the police and the employers ceased trying to move trucks. The employers, the Teamsters and the building trades signed a formal truce agreement. Johannes, however, declared that the police would move trucks once the truce expired, leading the union to announce that it was resuming picketing.\n\nAt this point city government appealed for Governor Floyd B. Olson to mobilize the National Guard, the 34th Infantry Division (United States) under Adjutant General Ellard A. Walsh. Olson did, but stopped short of actually deploying them, unwilling to alienate his labor supporters. Olson had already been attempting to mediate the dispute, On May 25, the employers and the union reached an agreement on a contract that provided union recognition, reinstatement for all strikers, seniority and a no-discrimination clause. The membership approved it overwhelmingly.\n\nThe union thought that it had the employers' agreement to include the \"inside workers\", the warehouse employees as well as the drivers and loaders. When the employers reneged on that agreement the strike resumed on Tuesday, July 17. Governor Olson again mobilized, but did not deploy, the National Guard.\n\nThe union's leadership had chosen to use different tactics in this strike; it ordered its members to picket without carrying any clubs or weapons of any sort. The police, on the other hand, armed themselves with riot guns which sprayed buckshot over a wide arc.\n\nOn Friday, July 20, a single yellow truck drove to the central market escorted by fifty armed policemen. The truck made the small delivery successfully, but a vehicle carrying picketers wielding clubs cut off the truck. The police opened fire on the vehicle with shotguns, then turned their guns on the strikers filling the surrounding streets. An eyewitness reported that as the pickets moved to aid their fallen comrades, \"They flowed directly into buckshot fire ... And the cops let them have it as they picked up their wounded. Lines of living, solid men fell, broke, wavering.\" He also said he saw one man \"stepping on his own intestines, bright and bursting in the street, and another holding his severed arm in his right hand.\" By the end of hostilities, two strikers (Henry Ness and John Belor) were dead and sixty-seven wounded.\n\nThe police violence sparked a show of support from other unions and a one-day strike of transport workers. Each side stepped back from the confrontation: Chief Johannes and Mayor Bainbridge faced calls for their impeachment, while the union continued to urge its members not to give the police any justification for further attacks, disarming a number of picketers who wanted to return fire with fire. The union did not make any overt efforts to stop those few trucks accompanied by convoys of forty police cars apiece that tried to deliver goods, but sent so many cars with pickets to accompany those convoys that the police were never able to shepherd more than a few delivery trucks on any given day.\n\nA public commission, set up later by the governor, reported: \nOn July 26, and these deaths of protestors at the hands of the police, Farmer-Labor governor Olson declared martial law and mobilized four thousand National Guardsmen of the 34th Infantry. Following this mobilization, there was no further loss of life.\n\nBetween July 26 and August 1, the National Guard began issuing operating permits to truck drivers, and engaging in roving patrols, curfews, and security details. On August 1, National Guard troops seized strike headquarters and placed arrested union leaders in a stockade at the state fairgrounds in Saint Paul. The next day, the headquarters were restored to the union and the leaders released from the stockade, as the National Guard carried out a token raid on the Citizens Alliance headquarters.\n\nThe union appealed to the Central Labor Union for a general strike and the governor issued an ultimatum that he would stop all trucks by midnight, August 5, if there was no settlement. Nevertheless, by August 14, there were thousands of trucks operating under military permits. Although the strike was gravely weakened by martial law and economic pressure, union leaders made it clear that it would continue.\n\nOn August 21, a federal mediator got acceptance of a settlement proposal from A. W. Strong, head of the Citizens Alliance, incorporating the union's major demands. The settlement was ratified and the back of employer resistance to unionization in Minneapolis was broken. In March 1935, International president Daniel Tobin expelled Local 574 from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). However, in August 1936, Tobin was forced to relent and recharter the local as 544. The leaders of 544 went on to develop the area and conference bargaining that exists today in the IBT.\n\nLocal 544 remained under socialist leadership until 1941, when eighteen leaders of the union and the Socialist Workers Party were sentenced to federal prison, the first victims of the anti-radical Smith Act, a law eventually found by the United States Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe strike changed Minneapolis, which had been an open shop citadel under the control of the Citizens Alliance for years before 1934. In the aftermath of this strike thousands of other workers in other industries organized with the assistance of Local 574.\n\nThe strike also gave the Communist League, later renamed the Workers Party of America, a strong position in Local 574, and in other Teamster locals within the metropolitan area of Minneapolis. Trotskyist strength grew to over 100 members. This gave leadership to the Trotskyists through the various unions they led within the Central Labor Council. As mentioned below, through organizing the first area-wide contract for any union outside of rail, the Trotskyists established locals of their party where ever there were Teamster locals, from South Dakota to Iowa to Colorado. The party was later driven out of that local by prosecutions under the Smith Act and a trusteeship imposed by Tobin in the early 1940s.\n\nMore importantly, the strike launched the career of Farrell Dobbs, who played a significant role in the organization of over-the-road drivers throughout the Midwest. Those efforts led in turn to the transformation of the Teamsters from a craft union, made up of locals with a parochial focus on their own craft and locality, into a truly national union.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866310", "title": "Military history of Spain", "text": "Military history of Spain\n\nThe military history of Spain, from the period of the Carthaginian conquests over the Phoenicians to the current Afghan War spans a period of more than 2200 years, and includes the history of battles fought in the territory of modern Spain, as well as her former and current overseas possessions and territories, and the military history of the people of Spain, regardless of geography.\n\nSpain's early military history emerged from her location on the western fringes of the Mediterranean, a base for attacks between Rome and Carthage. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Spain was devastated by successive barbarian invasions, with stability only gradually appearing with the later years of the Visigothic kingdom. The early Middle Ages for Spain saw the country forming the front line in a battle between Christian and Islamic forces in the Mediterranean; the Conquista and Reconquista took centuries to reach a military resolution. The 16th and 17th centuries marked the peak of Spanish power, the so-called Spanish Golden Age. Spain acquired vast empire by defeating the centralised states of the Americas, and colonising the Philippines. Her tercio units, backed by imperial gold and silver, were dominant in Europe. It was not until the years after the Thirty Years' War that Spanish military power began to fade; even then, supported by a reinvigorated navy, Spain remained a major military power throughout the 18th century, in competition with Britain and France on the global stage.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars changed Spanish military history dramatically; the Peninsular War saw the development of guerrilla warfare against the occupying French forces. The collapse of central Spanish authority resulted in successful wars of independence amongst Spain's American colonies, drastically reducing the size of her empire, and in turn led to a sequence of civil wars in Spain itself, many fought by frustrated veterans of the French and colonial campaigns. Attempts to reassert imperial power during the mid-19th century, enabled by the development of the steam frigate ultimately failed, leading to the collapse of the remnants of Spain's empire in the Americas and Asia in 1898 at the hands of a rising power, the United States of America. The political tensions that had driven the Carlist Wars remained unchecked, spilling over once again in the Spanish Civil War of 1936–9. Bringing a foretaste of the tactics of the Second World War, several nations used the conflict as a testing ground for new aerial and armoured warfare tactics. In the post-war period, Spain has increasingly turned away from the last remaining colonial conflicts in Africa, and played a growing modern military role within the context of the NATO alliance.\n\nIn the classical period, Spain was a mix of Celtic and Iberian tribal states, and Greek and Phoenician trading ports, with the largest state being the kingdom of Tartessus. With the eruption of war between Carthage, a Phoenician colony in North Africa and the Greeks, the Carthaginians begin extending their influence in Iberia, creating the city of New Carthage (Cartagena), in hopes of creating a trading empire. Following the First Punic War with Rome, in 237 BC, Hamilcar Barca, the famous Carthaginian general, then began the conquest of Turdetania (the successor state of Tartessus) and Gades to provide a springboard for further attacks on Rome. Hamilcar entrusted the conquest and military governance of the region to his son Hasdrubal the Fair – his other son, Hannibal, would march his troops across Hispania with elephants to lead them on Rome in the Second Punic War. During that war, Rome declared Hispania to be a Roman \"provincia\" in 218 BC, beginning a century-long campaign to subdue the people of Iberia to Roman.\nAfter the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Hispania in the Second and Third Punic Wars, Rome attempted to subdue the native tribes. In the northeasterly province of Hispania Citerior, the Celtiberian Wars occupied Roman forces for the better part of the 2nd century. In Hispania Ulterior, the Lusitanian War did the same. The resistance of the Lusitani under Viriathus became legendary across the Empire. In the troubled final years of the Republic, Quintus Sertorius held most of Iberia as a \"de facto\" independent sovereign against the partisans of Sulla. His attitude towards the natives and his military reforms – he was a partisan of Marius – secured him the loyalty of the populace and the army and his general success until his assassination. The Spanish era, a dating system predominant in Iberia until the close of the Middle Ages, began in 38 BC. The last region of Hispania to be subjected was the northwest, finally being conquered in the Cantabrian Wars, which ended in 19 BC.\n\nUnder Roman rule, Hispania contributed, like the rest of empire, to the Roman military, providing both legionaries, and auxiliary forces, in particular \"alae\" cavalry. Hispania also shaped Roman military affairs more subtely. The famous Roman infantry sword, the Gladius, stemmed directly or indirectly from the Spanish development of the \"Gladius Hispaniensis\"; with minor alterations, this would form the standard Roman weapon for several centuries. Hispania also provided several of Rome's more famous military Emperors, including Trajan, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius.\n\nDuring the third through 6th centuries, the Roman Empire was beset by numerous barbarian invaders, mostly Germanic, who migrated through its borders and began warring and settling in its territories. While the Vandals and Alans were fighting each other for supremacy in southern Gaul, the confederation of the Suevi crossed the Pyrenees and passing through Vasconia, entered Gallaecia in 409. The Vandals soon followed the Suevi example, with the Alans close behind. The Alans settled in Lusitania and Carthaginiensis and the Siling Vandals in Baetica, while the Asding Vandals vied with the Suevi for Gallaecia. The Visigoths crossed the Pyrenees to expand their kingdom in 416. They pushed the Vandals and Alans south, defeating and killing the Alan king Attaces in 426 and forcing the two tribes to amalgamate and retreat across the Straits of Gibraltar into Africa. For almost thirty years, Spain was the location for vicious tribal conflicts.\nThe first barbarians to settle were the Suevi, whose king Hermeric, a former \"foederatus\" of Rome, ratified a peace with the local Hispano-Roman population in 438. Weary of fighting, Hermeric abdicated in favour of his son Rechila. As the Visigothic kingdom expanded into Iberia, expelling the Vandals and Alans, the Suevi expanded their own realm as far south as Mérida. In 456, the new Catholic king, Rechiar, died in battle with the Visigoth king Theodoric II and the Suevi kingdom began to retreat under Gothic pressure. Beset by internal political conflict, the Suevi capitulated to the Visigoths in 585. Some resistance was maintained for a few years, but soon the last of Suevi resistance was erased.\n\nThe Visigoths consolidated a kingdom spanning most of Iberia and Gaul. For the next two centuries, they warred not only amongst themselves in a sequence of succession crises – which followed the election of a new king after every royal death, but also against the Byzantine Empire, which was trying to regain lost territory in the south, the Arian Suevi trying to preserve their hold on Gallaecia, and the Franks pushing south against them from Gaul. The Visigoth military structure was highly decentralised – the great territorial magnates, the \"duces\" (dukes), maintained their own armies, as in all the great Germanic kingdoms of Europe at the time. These armies rarely cooperated in campaigns. At the Battle of Vouillé in 507, the Franks under Clovis I wrested control of Aquitaine from the Visigoths. The Visigoths lost all of their territory north of the Pyrenees except the province of Gallia Narbonensis. The first half of the 6th century was largely a failure for the Visigoths. They failed to hold onto their Gallic possessions, they failed to oust the Suevi, and they failed to repulse the Byzantine Empire when it first endeavoured to reassert control over its Iberian provinces, taking advantage of a local rebellion. In 554, Granada and southernmost Hispania Baetica were taken from the Byzantines; under the last Arian king, Leovigild, the Suevi kingdom was annexed in 585 and the war of reconquest against the remainder of the Byzantine territories was begun, finally being completed under King Suintila in 624. The Visigoths faced no serious external threat from then on until the sudden Moorish invasion of 711.\n\nFor almost seven hundred years, Spain was the battleground for the opposing forces of the Islamic Caliphate and Western Christian forces. Both Muslims and Christian were motivated by religious conviction, which inspired the warfare. The initial Islamic invasion of Iberia was sudden and unexpected. The varied Moorish tribes of Morocco united under the leadership of Arab generals sent by the reigning Umayyad caliph and crossed the Straits of Gibraltar in 711 under the leadership of the Berber Tariq ibn Ziyad. Tariq won a swift victory at the Guadalete and defeated and killed the reigning Gothic king, Roderic. In a campaign lasting eight years, the whole of Iberia was subjected to Umayyad authority, except for the Asturias mountain range in the far northwest and the pockets of resistance in Navarre. The Islamic offensive ultimately paused after the losses it suffered in Frankland and in the Asturias, where battles such as those at Tours and Covadonga showed some of the potential weaknesses of the Arab methods of warfare.\n\nThe Islamic conquest was only very slowly undone, over the course of seven centuries in what the Christians of Spain called the \"Reconquista\". Three main forces were involved in this process, the Visigothic holdouts in the Asturias, the holdouts in Navarre and the Pyrenees, and the Franks of Aquitaine. The Reconquista, as a concerted effort to remove the Muslims from the territories they held, commenced in the reign of Alfonso I (739 – 757). Alfonso led an offensive into the valley of the Duero and left the region depopulated, the so-called \"Desert of the Duero\". For the next century, this prevented any serious Islamic incursions into the Christian territories of the north. During the late 8th and early 9th centuries, the Franks under their Carolingian rulers took up the cause of reconquest along the Mediterranean littoral. By 797, Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, captured Barcelona, establishing a clear bulwark against future invasions. The Basques extended their kingdom as far as Nájera, and a widespread \"repoblación\" of the depopulated areas began, extending Christian borders southwards.\n\nDespite a resurgence during the 10th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba's attempts to reverse the Reconquista failed, and by the 11th century, Christian Iberia was united under Sancho the Great, the King of Navarre, whilst the caliphate was divided and engulfed by civil war, the period of the \"taifas\". The 11th century saw the development of a concept of Christian holy war, to be waged against Islam with the purpose of the Christians recapturing long lost territories – the Crusade. Crusading, under other names, also took place in Spain; Franks and Normans and even Papal troops took to Spain in increasing numbers to join the locals in their fight against \"the Moor.\" The last threat of the 11th century came in the form of the Almoravids, who with their well disciplined forces first established a hegemony over Morocco and then extended it over al-Andalus. While the \"Reconquista\" paused in the west, to the east Alfonso the Battler, the King of Aragon, redoubled efforts to retake the valley of the Ebro. In 1212, the \"Reconquistadores\" gained a decisive victory over the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Shortly after the battle, the Castilians took Baeza and, then, Úbeda, major fortified cities near the battlefield, and gateways to invade Andalucia. Thereafter, Ferdinand III of Castile retook Córdoba in 1236, Jaén in 1246, and Seville in 1248; then he took Arcos, Medina-Sidonia, Jerez and Cádiz, effectively bringing the bulk of the reconquista to a conclusion.\n\nLate medieval Spain was divided into the three Christian kingdoms of Navarre, Castile and Aragon, alongside the small, last remaining Islamic state of Granada. The civil wars and conflicts of the late 14th and early 15th century would result in the unification of the Christian kingdoms; combined with advances in naval technology, this would pave the way for the rise of Spain as a dominant European power.\n\nCastile, a medium-sized kingdom with a strong maritime tradition, was plunged into civil war following the death of Alfonso XI in 1349; the conflict between Pedro of Castile and Henry II of Castile became bound up with the wider politics of the Hundred Years' War. With France supporting Henry and his descendants, England exploited opportunities to destabilise the regime. Attempts by John I, Henry's son, to unify Castile and Portugal, resulted in a Portuguese uprising and the intervention of the English John of Gaunt, claiming the Castilian throne by right of marriage. Not until 1387 was the civil war finally concluded, with John of Gaunt accepting a cash settlement. Aragon, a smaller kingdom but with widespread claims to lands across the Mediterranean, also saw internal clashes over dynastic inheritance; Peter IV fought a harsh campaign against his nobles from 1346–9 over his daughter's right to inherit the throne.\n\nThe threat of internal stability remained until the marriage of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469. The two monarchs were promptly challenged by Joan of Castile but were swiftly successful. Isabella would go on to establish the \"Hermandad\" militia system, which would provide her with a royal counterbalance to any future challenge from the nobility. The two monarchs proceeded to conquer the Kingdom of Granada, the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula, which was completed by 1492. In that same year, the Alhambra Decree was issued, expelling all Jews from both Castile and Aragon. Now unified, Spain now enjoyed relative internal stability; rights and lands across the Mediterranean; and a strong tradition of seafaring in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean, which it would maximise in the coming decades.\n\nAfter Christopher Columbus's successful navigation to the New World under Spanish patronage, Spanish forces rapidly began to occupy much of the new territories, rapidly taking the Bahamas and defeating the local Arawak speaking indigenous groups. The efforts of Ferdinand Magellan, reaching the island of Limasawa in 1521, led to the subsequent establishment of the colony of the Philippines under Miguel López de Legazpi which was to become an essential Spanish military base in the Pacific. The challenge of the Barbary Pirates encouraged defensive and punitive expeditions across the Mediterranean, resulting in the conquest of various outposts in North Africa, including Melilla in 1497, Mazalquivir in 1505, Oran in 1509, Algiers in 1510, Tripoli in 1511 and the smaller Plazas de Soberania.\n\nThe Spanish Army did not defeat the Aztec and Inca Empires. The most dramatic impact of Spanish military power, however, lay in the defeat of the American empires of the Aztecs and Incas. From 1519–21, a coalition army of Spanish soldiers and Tlaxcalan warriors led by Hernán Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger defeated the Aztec Empire; in 1532, Francisco Pizarro and his brothers Gonzalo and Hernando invaded and occupied the Inca Empire from their base in Panama. Both wars in which very small numbers of Spanish soldiers – the conquistadors – who were mostly veterans of Spain's European or North African campaigns, were backed by local allies and defeated well established empires, shared many similarities. The highly proficient conquistadors benefited from their access to cavalry, steel swords, axes, spears, pikes, halberds, bows, crossbows, helmets and armour, not to mention small cannon, none of which were familiar to local forces. The Spanish also benefited from their immunity to many common European diseases which were to decimate their local enemies.\n\nSpain had one of its worst military defeats in the War by Fire and blood (also known as the Chichimeca war). They were defeated by the native allies of the Great Chichimeca north of the Aztec empire. This war was very distinct considering the natives created arrows that were very effective at penetrating armor. They had to pay the natives for peace.\n\nThe Spanish were to fare less well against the less centralised societies of southern Chile, however, particularly once local forces began to adapt to, or actually adopt similar military technologies. Although Pedro de Valdivia was able to successfully invade Chile in 1540, the first great rebellion of the Arauco wars was to begin only 1553 later, marking the beginning of a conflict that would last until the 19th century. Spanish forces, operating at huge distances from their European or even Caribbean centres of power, were frequently available in small numbers; Valdivia had great difficulty in recruiting even the 150 Spanish soldiers he used to invade Chile, and the frequent reversals during the Arauco wars led to losses that often took several years to replace. As time progressed, the advantages of the Spanish began to increasingly centre on their access to early modern firearms, especially the musket, rather than the technologies that had won them their early successes.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Habsburg Spain saw a steady growth in its military power. The Italian Wars (1494–1559) resulted in an ultimate Spanish victory and hegemony in northern Italy by expelling the French. During the war, the Spanish army transformed its organization and tactics, evolving from a primarily pike and halberd wielding force into the first pike and shot formation of arquebusiers and pikemen, known as the colunella. During the 16th century this formation evolved into the tercio infantry formation. The new formation and battle tactics were developed because of Spain's inability to field sufficient cavalry forces to face the heavy French cavalry. Habsburg Spain came to enjoy an axis of allied and neutral territories from Naples through Milan and northwards to the Netherlands, a route for reinforcements that came to be called the Spanish Road. Backed by the financial resources drawn from the Americas, Spain could afford to mount lengthy campaigns against her enemies, such as the long running Dutch revolt (1568–1609), defending Christian Europe from Ottoman raids and invasions, supporting the Catholic cause in the French civil wars and fighting, England during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). The Spanish army grew in size from around 20,000 in the 1470s, to around 300,000 by the 1630s during the Thirty Years' War that tore Europe apart, requiring the recruitment of soldiers from across Europe. With such numbers involved, Spain had trouble funding the war efforts on so many fronts. The non-payment of troops led to many mutinies and events such as the Sack of Antwerp (1576), when unpaid tercio units looted the Dutch city.\n\nIn the east, Habsburg Spain fought alongside other Christian allies against the Ottoman Empire, taking part in numerous actions and campaigns in and around the Mediterranean over the period. The naval competition culminated in victory for the Christian alliance at the battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last naval battle in the Mediterranean to see the large scale use of galleys by both sides. In the middle of the century, Spain developed the galleon for naval warfare, using them in convoys to link her possessions in the Philippines, the Americas and Europe.\nThe Manila galleons sailed once or twice per year across the Pacific Ocean, whilst the Spanish treasure fleets linked Mexico back to Europe.\nSpain fought the Castilian War against the Bruneian Empire. Spanish forces attempted to conquer Cambodia in the Cambodian–Spanish War but were defeated. The Moros fought against the Spanish invasion for centuries in the Spanish–Moro conflict. The Igorot people resisted and fought against the Spanish.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) drew in Spain alongside most other European states. Spain entered the conflict with a strong position, but the ongoing fighting gradually eroded her advantages; first Dutch, then Swedish innovations had made the tercio more vulnerable, having less flexibility and firepower than its more modern equivalents. Nevertheless, Spanish armies continued to win major battles and sieges throughout this period across large swathes of Europe. French entry into the war in 1635 put additional pressure on Spain, with the French victory at the Battle of Rocroi in 1643 being a major boost for the French, though it proved far from decisive in the long-running Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659). By the signing of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which brought an end to most of the fighting, Spain was clearly exhausted. Politics too had begun to count against Spain. While Spain was fighting France, Portugal — which had been under personal union with Spain for 60 years – acclaimed John IV of Braganza as king in 1640. \n\nSpain was forced to accept the independence of the Dutch Republic in 1648, another sign of diminishing power. In the second half of the century, a much reduced and increasingly neglected Spanish army became infamous for being poorly equipped and rarely paid. For the remainder of the century, France continued to grow in relative power under Louis XIV. The Franco-Spanish War (1635–59) ended in defeat. However, despite some Spanish concessions (Roussillon and French Flanders); the Spanish maintained their main territorial holdings in the Low Countries, Italy and Catalonia. The War of Devolution (1667–8) proved a one sided affair, as French forces overcame badly neglected Spanish forces and fortifications, marking the military ascendancy of France. The outcome of the War of the Reunions (1683-1683) had a similar outcome. During the Nine Years' War, Spain also lost Catalonia to France but it was restored to the kingdom in 1697 with the treaty of Ryswick. \n\nThe centre of Spanish military power shifted dramatically in the early 18th century. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was both a civil and international war in which the French backed the Bourbon contender for the Spanish throne and an alliance led by Austria, the Netherlands and Britain backed the Habsburg contender while a divided Spain fought on both sides. The war secured the Spanish throne for the Bourbon Philip as Philip V of Spain at the Peace of Utrecht but in the war's settlement, Spain had to give up the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, Milan, Sardinia, Sicily, Gibraltar and Menorca to the Habsburg allies. Spain's defeat by the combined alliance of France, Britain, the Netherlands and Austria in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–1720) confirmed the decline from her former dominance, whilst the successful deployment of the Britain's Royal Navy into the Mediterranean, by exploiting the fortress of Gibraltar, gained in 1704 by an Anglo-Dutch force during the war of succession, would create considerable difficulties in the following years.\n\nGlobally, Spain remained an important naval and military power, depending on critical sea lanes stretching from Spain through the Caribbean and South America, and westwards towards Manila and the Far East. The 18th century saw an ongoing struggle between the growing naval power of the rising imperial power Great Britain and Spain that worked to maintain it transoceanic links with its overseas empire, still by far the largest of the time. The number of Spanish galleons deploying across the Atlantic sea routes increased significantly in the first half of the century, undoing the decline of the latter 17th century. Britain used the exclusive right to non-Spanish slave trading in Spanish America for thirty years which she had gained at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession as an excuse for increased military intervention, such as during the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739–1748). During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), Britain attempted to leverage its existing island bases along the Spanish Main and the Spanish West Indies, briefly occupied Havana and Manila, but in each case the British hold was tenuous and practical and strategic considerations led to their return in exchange for Florida. During the American War of Independence, Spanish forces reconquered Florida and assisted the American rebels with arms and soldiers and by attacks on British trade and supplies. Both Spain and Britain made extensive use of privateers throughout the war, the Spanish exploiting fully the British prejudice against using the convoy system to protect its expensive merchant assets in times of war. The earlier war of the Polish succession was still seen as positive for Spain, as the kingdom did recover the territories lost after the war of Spanish succession, in Italy. However, during the Seven Years' War, three Spanish attempts to conquer Portugal ended in crushing disasters.\n\nThe huge distances involved in warfare between European powers in the Americas usually counted in favour of the defenders. Attacks on Spanish possessions, such as the amphibious assaults launched during the War of Jenkins' Ear ended in failure for the British as their overstretched forces failed to overcome well led defensive actions. Spain's involvement in the American Revolutionary War (1779–83) was largely a success, underlining the resources that Spain still had at its disposal. Spain entered the war after the Battle of Saratoga, with the aim, as in the Seven Years' War, of recovering Gibraltar and Menorca and removing the British threat to their Gulf of Mexico colonies. Their successful defence of the Louisiana Territory, the invasion of Menorca in 1781, and the capture of West Florida from the British, showed a renewed strength in the New World, although the British defence of Gilbratar prevented the Spanish achieving all their war goals.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars were to have a tremendous impact on Spanish military history, both within Spain itself and across her American colonies. French armies, rapidly deposing the Spanish king. Spain's subsequent liberation struggle marked one of the first national wars and the emergence of large-scale guerrillas, from which the English language borrowed the word. While the French occupation destroyed the Spanish administration, which fragmented into quarrelling provincial juntas (in 1810, a reconstituted national government fortified itself in Cádiz) and proved unable to recruit, train, or equip effective armies, Napoleon's failure to pacify the people of Spain allowed Spanish, British and Portuguese forces to secure Portugal and engage French forces on the frontiers while Spanish \"guerrilleros\" wore down the occupiers. As to the role played by the Spanish armies, David Gates notes, \"Furthermore, irrespective of the quality of their men, the Spanish armies constituted a threat that the French quite simply could not ignore. Any sizeable concentration of enemy soldiers had to be engaged, or at least contained, by a sufficiently strong force of Imperial troops; otherwise they were free to go on the rampage with impunity. Consequently, a colossal percentage of the French army was rendered unavailable for operations against Wellington because innumerable Spanish contingents kept materialising all over the country.\" Acting in concert, regular and irregular allied forces prevented Napoleon's marshals from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces. The Spanish navy, put to sea in support of France during the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, suffered terrible losses at the Battle of Trafalgar, having been weakened by yellow fever in the preceding years; in many ways this marked the nadir of Spanish naval history.\nThe events in mainland Spain had extensive consequences for her empire. Spain's colonies in the Americas had shown an increasing independence in the years running up to the Peninsular War; British attempts to invade the Río de la Plata in 1806–7, for example, had been rebuffed by well organised local militia. The occupation of the Spanish homeland, however, resulted in first a sequence of uprisings in support of the imprisoned king, and then a struggle for independence that increasingly formed a series of civil wars across the Spanish dominions in the America. The conflict started in 1808, with juntas established in Mexico and Montevideo in reaction to the events of the Peninsular War. The conflict, lasting twenty years, was far from one sided. Patriot forces were often underequipped, largely peasant militia armies commanded by amateur officers; Royalist forces, partially supported from Spain over huge sea distances, were frequently able to gain the upper hand. The Spanish navy was easily able to dominate the local, coastal navies of her colonies. Campaigning across the huge distances of South America, frequently in winter conditions with minimal supplies, resulted in terrible privation. Ultimately, Royalist exhaustion and growing political maturity amongst the new states resulted in the creation of a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north. Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, Spain's military found itself involved in an increasing number of internal conflicts, distracting military attention from other priorities, and continuing to undermine the Spanish economy. The first of these, the Trienio Liberal (1820–3) involved a revolt by soldiers against King Ferdinand VII while they were being embarked for a campaign in America. France intervened militarily to support the monarchy, restoring order, but this was short-lived. When Ferdinand died in 1833, his fourth wife Maria Cristina became Queen regent on behalf of their infant daughter Isabella II. This splintered the country into two factions known as the Cristinos – the supporters of the Queen regent – and the Carlists, the supporters of Carlos V, who had rejected the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830 that abolished the Salic law. The First Carlist War lasted over seven years and the fighting spanned most of the country at one time or another, although the main conflict centered on the Carlist homelands of the Basque Country and Aragon. Many of the military officers involved had served in the Peninsular War a few years before. The Second Carlist War was a minor Catalan uprising in support of Carlos VI, lasting from 1846 to 1849. The Third Carlist War began after Queen Isabella II was overthrown by a conspiracy of liberal generals in 1868, and left Spain in some disgrace; four years later, the latest Carlist pretender, Carlos VII, decided that only force of arms could win him the throne. This Third Carlist War lasted until 1876.\nUnder Isabella II of Spain, there were several, ultimately unsuccessful, attempts to reassert Spanish military influence around the world, often in partnership with France. In 1848 Spain intervened to support Pope Pius IX against local republican opposition. In February 1849, five warships, including the frigates steamed to Gaeta from Barcelona, three more from Cadiz following in May. In total, 4,000 Spanish soldiers were deployed in Gaeta and placed at the Pope's disposition. This marked the Spanish Army's first expeditionary venture into Italy since the War of the Austrian Succession a hundred years prior. In partnership with the French, Spanish columns secured the region. In 1858 Spain joined with France to intervene in Cochin China, donating 300 Filipino troops to the invasion. Spain joined an allied expedition in support of the French intervention in Mexico. In 1859, Spain fought a short war with Morocco, resulting in a stronger Spanish position in North Africa. By the 1860s, Spain had built up a very large navy again, and in 1864 Spain intervened along the South American cost, seizing the guano-rich Chincha Islands from its former colony of Peru. Although the new Spanish steam frigates were superior to local vessels, the huge distances and lack of land support ultimately concluded with Spain handing back the islands at the end of the Chincha Islands War. An attempt to recolonise Santo Domingo similarly failed by 1865 in the face of fierce guerrilla resistance.\n\nSpain faced a sequence of challenges across her colonies in the second half of the century that would result in a total defeat of empire at the hands of the growing power of the United States. Spain's colony of Cuba rebelled in 1868, leading to a sequence of brutal guerrilla insurgencies and retaliations, through the Ten Years' War (1868–1878), the Little War (1879–1880) and finally the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898). Spain, although militarily occupied with the Carlist troubles at home, put increasing resources into the conflict, slowly taking the upper hand, and assisted by American sales of modern weaponry. By 1898, however, increasing U.S. political interests in Cuba were encouraging a more interventionist policy. The sinking of the USS \"Maine\" in Havana harbour provided the trigger for the Spanish–American War, in which Spain's aging navy fared disastrously. Cuba gained its independence and Spain lost its remaining New World colony, Puerto Rico, which together with Guam and the Philippines it ceded to the United States for 20 million dollars. In 1899, Spain sold its remaining Pacific islands – the Northern Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands and Palau – to Germany, reducing Spain's colonial possessions to Spanish Morocco, the Spanish Sahara and Spanish Guinea, all in Africa.\n\nAlthough Spain remained neutral during World War I, despite suffering considerable economic losses to German submarines, she was militarily active elsewhere during the early part of the 20th century, attempting to strengthen her position in North Africa. Despite successes in the late 19th century, the first Rif War (1893–4) around Melilla had also shown the potential weakness of the Spanish position along the coast. The second Rif War (1909–10) was initially a fiasco for the under-equipped and undertrained Spanish, until heavy artillery was brought in; in the aftermath of the war, Spain began to raise units of local Regulares. The third Rif War (1920–1926) also began badly for the Spanish, especially after the disaster of Annual (1921), resulting in various changes to the Spanish approach. Working in alliance with French forces in the region, Spain created the Spanish Legion along similar lines to the French Foreign Legion to provide additional experienced forces. Spain also became the first country to deploy chemical weapons by air, dropping mustard gas from aircraft.\nIn 1931, following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, the armed forces of the Spanish Kingdom became the Spanish Republican Armed Forces.\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936–9) began right after the Spanish coup of July 1936, a partially successful \"coup d'état\" by a section of the Spanish Army against the government of the Spanish Republic. The ensuing Civil War devastated Spain, ending with the victory of the rebels and the founding of the Spanish State, led by \"caudillo\" Francisco Franco, the leader of the Nationalist army.\n\nThe civil war was marked by the extensive involvement of international units. Many joined the Republican side under the banner of the International Brigades. The Nationalists enjoyed support from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, with several new technologies being trialled as a result. The Nationalist side conducted aerial bombing of cities in Republican territory, carried out mainly by the Luftwaffe volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Italian air force volunteers of the \"Corpo Truppe Volontarie\" – the most notorious example of this tactic of terror bombings was the bombing of Guernica. The first combat use of the \"Stuka\" occurred during the conflict. The civil war influenced European military thinking on the alleged supremacy of the bomber. Armoured warfare was also trialled by Nationalist supporters; German volunteers first used armor in live field conditions in the form of the Panzer Battalion 88, a force built around three companies of PzKpfw I tanks that functioned as a training cadre for Nationalists.\n\nWeakened and politically still fragile, Spain remained officially neutral during World War II. However, to repay Hitler for his assistance in the Civil War, Franco raised a volunteer corps, the Blue Division (with an aerial counterpart, the Blue Squadron), to fight on the Eastern Front. In that way, by only fighting the Soviet Union, Franco could repay Hitler while staying at peace with the Western Allies. Nearly fifty thousand Spanish personnel served from June 1941 til October 1943, seeing fierce action in the Siege of Leningrad and the Battle of Krasny Bor. After Franco was pressured by Allied leaders to withdraw the Division, a token force of volunteers remained as the Blue Legion. Fighting for the Allies, many exiled Spanish Republicans, called Spanish Maquis, joined the French Resistance. Thousands also served in the Free French Forces; particularly of note is the Ninth Armoured Company under General Leclerc's Second Division. The first Allied unit to enter Paris in 1944, it was almost entirely made up of Spanish exiles.\n\nIn the post-war period, Spain was initially still heavily influenced by events in North Africa, particularly surrounding its colony of Western Sahara The first of these conflicts, the Ifni War (1956–1958) saw Spanish forces, including Spain's first paratroop unit, clash with the Moroccan Liberation Army, a Moroccan state backed insurgency movement. In 1958, a joint French-Spanish offensive, using massively superior European air power, crushed the revolt. In the 1970s, the rise of another insurgency movement, Polisario, resulted in the Western Sahara War (1973–1991), with Spain withdrawing from its colony in 1975 and transferring its support in the continuing conflict to Morocco.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards, however, Spain began to build increasingly close links with the U.S. armed forces. The Spanish Air Force received its first American jets, such as the F-86 Sabre and Lockheed T-33, from America, whilst the equipment of the Spanish military was again modernised in the 1970s to prepare for Spain's membership of NATO in 1982. Spain sent a small medical unit to the Vietnam War, and a team of engineers to the Gulf War with Spain lending airpower to the NATO efforts during the Bosnian War, the Kosovo War and Libyan Civil War. Most recently, Spain has participated in both the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHistorically, in addition to Latin military terms that came down from Roman times into modern Spanish through the language, the Spanish adopted a number of Arabic military terms from their Muslim rivals. Subsequently, a number of Spanish military terms have been adopted into French, English and other languages.\n\n"}

Since the 1990s, he has performed in supporting and lead roles as a comedy actor in Tamil films.\n\nWhile having worked in more than 200 films, Vadivelu received awards in the Best Comedian category for his performances in \"Kaalam Maari Pochu\" (1996), \"Vetri Kodi Kattu\" (2000), \"Thavasi\" (2001), \"Chandramukhi\" (2005), \"Imsai Arasan 23m Pulikesi\" (2006), \"Marudhamalai\" (2007) and \"Kathavarayan\" (2008). His popularity led to his media-coined nickname, \"Vaigai Puyal\", meaning \"Vaigai storm\", referring to the river that flows through his hometown Madurai.\n\nHe did not have a formal education, instead he worked in his father's glass cutting business and continued it with his brothers after his father's passing. In his free time, he participated in local stage plays, usually in a comic role.\n\nVadivelu was born on 12 September 1960 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu to Natarajan Pillai and Sarojini. Vadivelu has four children, three daughters, Kannigaparameswari, Karthiga, Kalaivani, and a son, Subramaniyan.\n\nVadivelu met Rajkiran on a train while on his way to Chennai to visit his bride-to-be. Rajkiran later recalled that he was so amused by their conversation during the train ride that he agreed to give Vadivelu a role in his upcoming film, \"En Rasavin Manasile\", directed by Kasthuri Raja.\n\nStarting as a sidekick to the famed Goundamani-Senthil comedy duo, Vadivelu rose to prominence after his role in \"Kadhalan\" (1994), although his debut film was \"En Thangai Kalyani\" directed by T. Rajendar. \n\nHe later went on to perform numerous roles, including \"Bharathi Kannamma\", \"Friends\", \"Vetri Kodi Kattu\", \"Winner\", \"Giri\", \"Thalainagaram\", \"Marudhamalai\", and \"Chandramukhi\". As the lead in the film \"Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi\" (2006), he played twin brothers. His next lead role was in \"Indiralogathil Na Azhagappan\" (2008).\n\nOn 21 September 2008, Vadivelu's residence in the Saligramam neighbourhood in Chennai was pelted with stones by a gang, leaving several windows broken and furniture damaged. The actor had taken refuge in a room in his home and was safe. Vadivelu is said to have suspected Vijayakanth because of a recent case that he had filed against the latter for assault and because the final court hearing was to take place the following day. He suspected that the attack may have been carried out to prevent Vadivelu from attending the hearing. As a result, Vadivelu filed another case against Vijayakanth for attempted murder. He later mentioned his interest in contesting against Vijayakanth in the upcoming assembly elections and in his words, \"teaching him a lesson.\" In response, actor Vijayakanth, in a press meet on 22 September, claimed that Vadivelu's allegations were based on hearsay.\n\nIn 2010, Vadivelu held a press conference, accusing fellow comedian and actor Singamuthu for forgery and financial cheating. Vadivelu, who was previously friends with Singamuthu, purchased land from him but later came to learn that the documents were void. This resulted in the former taking legal action against the latter.\n\nDuring the legislative assembly elections that place in Tamil Nadu during April 2011, Vadivelu vehemently campaigned for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its alliance. During his public speeches, he predominantly condemned politician and actor Vijayakanth, whose party, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), allied with the opposition party All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), headed by Jayalalithaa. His allegations of Vijayakanth included him being a \"drunkard\". In a campaign speech in Tiruvarur, Vadivelu stated that \"(his) only aim is to sweep out Vijayakanth's whole team and to campaign vigorously for DMK's victory\". Vadivelu was criticised as being biased, only supporting a DMK-led victory for personal gains and not once mentioning anything against the official opposition, the AIADMK, or its leader. In a turn of events, the election was eventually successful for the AIADMK alliance, and Vijaykanth won his constituency by a considerable margin.\n\nAs his career as a lead actor was waning, Vadivelu chose to return to portraying supporting and comedy roles in films headlined by other actors. He portrayed a role alongside Vishal in Suraj's \"Kaththi Sandai\" (2016), before collaborating again with P. Vasu in the horror comedy \"Shivalinga\" (2017). Vadivelu then portrayed a supporting role alongside Vijay in \"Mersal\" (2017), with the film becoming a blockbuster at the box office. A critic from The New Indian Express noted that it was a \"brilliant comeback for Vadivelu\" and that \"his comedy is subtle, yet sufficient\".\n\nAfter agreeing to work with Chimbu Deven on \"Imsai Arasan 24th Pulikecei\", a sequel to their successful film, he fell out with the director over an issue regarding his costume designer and subsequently refused to cooperate. The film's producers, S. Shankar and Subaskaran Allirajah, later filed a legal case over his unexplained absence. Likewise, R. K. and Stephen, the producers of \"Neeyum Naanum Naduvula Peyum\" and another untitled film, also opted to file complaints to the Nadigar Sangam against Vadivelu's lack of cooperation. The Tamil Film Producers Council issued a ban against casting Vadivelu in future films.\n\nIn 2019, Vadivelu was interviewed by \"Behindwoods\", in which he criticized Chimbu Deven and Shankar for their creative differences. Producer T. Siva and director Naveen (who worked as an assistant to Chimbu Deven in \"Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikesi\") spoke out against Vadivelu’s comments.\n\nVadivelu's roles involve heavy use of slapstick and puns, which has led him to be typecast. His comedy sequences typically end with him getting soundly thrashed and a closing one-liner from him bemoaning his situation or antagonists. His popularity could be ascribed to the general audience being able to identify with him thanks to his rustic looks, accent and body language.\n\nVadivelu's dialogues served as an inspiration for memes and trolls in social media. Many meme creators use Vadivelu's dialogues for all ongoing situations in the world to express irony. His dialogues have been part of daily conversation and also inspired the titles for various Tamil films. In 2019, Vadivelu was featured in the sudden viral memes related to the hashtag \"Pray for Nesamani\".\n\n"}

It is bounded by the \"comuni\" of Calciano, Campomaggiore, Cirigliano, Oliveto Lucano, Pietrapertosa, San Mauro Forte and Stigliano.\n\nThe territory is half covered by forests and pastures. Around the commune there are the Manche, Gallipoli, Montepiano, Vallefredda and Tempacortaglie mountains. Accettura is above sea level and is bordered to the north with the comunes of Campomaggiore and Calciano, to the east with Oliveto Lucano and San Mauro Forte, to the south with Stigliano and Cirigliano, and to the west with Pietrapertosa (PZ).\n\nThe term, according to some, is derived from the theme of the word \"acceptor\", which in Latin is Accipiter. For others, it stems from the symbol of the country, to accept a small plot of land, etc.\n\nThe first official mention of Accettura in documents was by Pope Nicholas II in 1060, who sent a document sent to the bishop of Tricarico, referring to it as \"Achitorem\".\n\nSituated in the Appennino Lucano in the Gallipoli-Cognato Park, was founded in the 10th century after the local population had abandoned three neighbouring villages. Nowadays the population work mainly in agriculture, stock-breeding and tourism.\n\nIn the tenth century was a feudal territory of Montescaglioso. In 1272, the town was completely destroyed by fire. Shortly after, Charles I of Anjou ordered its reconstruction.\n\nThroughout its history, Accettura was owned by several families: Bazzano, Della Marra, the Ponsiaco, the Carafa, and the Spinelli who held it until the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n\nMontepiano woods cover the territory of four communes in this region of Italy, Accettura, Cirigliano, Stigliano and Pietrapertosa. Inside were found numerous remains of fortifications, some of them as old as the third of fourth century BC.\n\nThe Museo dei culti arborei is located in Accettura and houses an exhibition of paintings, collections of photographs and video of the May festival in Accettura held every year, and tools typical of farming and forestry in the area. The museum offers texts and information on the anthropological and social rituals and the ancient traditions associated with the \"cult of beautiful trees\" of this area.\n\nThe economy is mainly based on livestock and cereal crops (affecting 73% of cultivated land).\n\nThe industrial sector is composed mainly of construction or manufacturing companies and is noted for its production of bricks and tiles, produced traditionally in an old furnace. There are also food companies and a service sector, which relies primarily on retail sales of furniture and food.\n\nTourism is not well developed. However, there are many hotels and restaurants.\n\n\n"}

It was published in \"Piae Cantiones\", a collection of Finnish/Swedish sacred songs published in 1581. No music is given for the verses, but the standard tune comes from older liturgical books.\n\nThe Latin text is a typical medieval song of praise, which follows the standard pattern for the time – a uniform series of four-line stanzas, each preceded by a two-line refrain (in the early English carol this was known as the \"burden\"). Carols could be on any subject, but typically they were about the Virgin Mary, the Saints or Yuletide themes.\n\nThe complete text of \"\", including the refrain:\n\nBritish folk rock group Steeleye Span had a hit in 1973 (No. 14, UK singles chart) with an a cappella recording of the song. Guitarist Bob Johnson had heard the song when he attended a folk-carol service with his father-in-law in Cambridge, and brought it to the attention of the rest of the band. (Unlike the album version which fades up slowly and fades down slowly, the single was at the same volume for the entire length of the song.)\n\nThis single is one of only three top 50 British hits to be sung fully in Latin (the others were both recordings of \"Pie Jesu\" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Requiem\"; firstly by Sarah Brightman and Paul Miles-Kingston in 1986, secondly as a minor hit by the 12-year-old Charlotte Church in 1998). In 1975 Mike Oldfield had a top 10 hit with \"In Dulci Jubilo\" but this Latin song was performed as an instrumental. \"Oh What a Circus\" from the 1976 musical \"Evita\", and a hit single performed by David Essex, includes a choral chant in Latin, based on the Catholic anthem \"Salve Regina\".\n\n\"Gaudete\" is also one of only a handful of a cappella performances to become hit singles.

{"id": "1866361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866361", "title": "Kitsune no yomeiri", "text": "Kitsune no yomeiri\n\nThe Kitsune no Yomeiri (, \"the fox's wedding\"), which is similar to \"\" in English, is a strange event told about in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The \"kitsune no yomeiri\" can refer to several things: atmospheric ghost lights, a phenomenon during which it appears as if paper lanterns from a wedding procession are floating through the dark; what is commonly referred to as a sunshower; and various strange wedding processions that can be seen in classical Japanese kaidan, essays, and legends. The \"kitsune no yomeiri\" is always closely related to foxes, or \"kitsune\" (who often play tricks on humans in Japanese legend) and various Shinto rituals and festive rights relating to the \"kitsune no yomeiri\" have been developed in various parts of Japan.\n\nA topography book of the Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture), from the Hōreki period, the \"Echigo Nayose\" (越後名寄), includes the following statement about the appearance of the \"kitsune no yomeiri\":\n\nIn here, lines of atmospheric ghost lights that stretch close to 4 kilometers are called \"kitsune no kon\", and also in Nakakubiki District, Niigata Prefecture, and Uonuma of the same prefecture, the Akita Prefecture, Sakuragawa, Ibaraki Prefecture, Nanakai, Nishiibaraki District of the same prefecture (now Shirosato), Hitachiōta of the same prefecture, Koshigaya, Saitama Prefecture, Higashichichibu of the same prefecture, the Tama area of Tokyo, the Gunma Prefecture, the Tochigi Prefecture, Mukawa, Hokuto, Yamanashi Prefecture, the Mie Prefecture, Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, and Nanbu, Saihaku District, Tottori Prefecture, among other places, when atmospheric ghost lights (kitsunebi) are seen in the countryside at night, it is called \"kitsune no yomeiri.\"\n\nWhat it is called varies depending on area; for example, the phenomenon is called \"kitsune no yometori (狐の嫁取り, the fox's wife-taking)\" in Sōka, Saitama Prefecture and Noto, Fugeshi District, Ishikawa Prefecture (now Noto, Hōsu District) while referred to as \"kitsune no shūgen\" (狐の祝言) in Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture.\n\nIn Japan, holding a wedding in a specific place did not become common until the middle of the Showa period. Prior to this, it was common for weddings to be performed in the evening and for the bride to enter with a procession of paper lanterns. Since atmospheric ghost lights that extend in a line can look like lanterns and torches from a wedding ceremony, and since paper lanterns were known to be used during a fox's wedding ceremony, they were thus called such names. There are several theories as to why the bride and groom are seen as foxes. One such theory says that although the lights appeared to be signifying a wedding, there was actually no wedding anywhere and the entire thing was an elaborate trick played by foxes. Because the mysterious lights looked like paper lanterns from afar but disappeared once one got close, it was almost as if one was being fooled by a fox.\n\nIn the past, in Toyoshima in Edo (now Toshima, Kita ward, Tokyo, and Ouji, of the same ward), for atmospheric ghost lights to continuously appear and quiver and shake around in the darkness is called \"kitsune no yomeiri,\" and is counted as one of the \"seven mysteries of Toshima\" told about in this village.\n\nIn Kirinzan, Niigata Prefecture, there lived many foxes, and it is said that there was a wedding procession at night that hanged paper lanterns. In Niigata as well as Shiki District, Nara Prefecture, a fox's wedding is thought to be connected to agriculture, and it is said that for many atmospheric ghost lights to appear means that it is a plentiful year, and for few of them to appear means it is year of poor crops.\n\nDepending on the area, there are legends including not only the sighting of atmospheric ghost lights but purported sightings of actual weddings as well. In Gyōda, Saitama Prefecture, it is said that kitsune no yomeiri frequently appears in the Kasuga Shrine in Tanigou, and it is reported that here and there along the road, fox feces can be found after one such reported event. In Horado, Mugi District, Gifu Prefecture (now Seki), it is said that it was not merely atmospheric ghost lights that were seen, but the sound of bamboo burning and tearing was also heard continuing for several days, but that there were no traces found even when an attempt was made to check what it was.\n\nIn the Tokushima Prefecture, they were not considered fox's weddings, but rather fox's funerals, and were an omen that someone was about to die.\n\nConcerning the true identity of these atmospheric ghost lights, it is thought that perhaps people mistook it for lights that were actually there, or possibly the illusion from an unusual refraction of light.\n\nIn the Kantō region, Chūbu region, Kansai region, Chūgoku region, Shikoku, Kyushu, among other places, sunshowers are called \"kitsune no yomeiri.\"\n\nLike atmospheric ghost lights, this phenomenon is called various names depending on area. In the Nanbu Region, Aomori Prefecture, it is called \"kitsune no yometori\" (狐の嫁取り, the fox's wife-taking), and in Serizawa, Chigasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture and the mountainous areas of Oe District, Tokushima Prefecture, it is called \"kitsune-ame\" (狐雨, fox rain). In the eastern Isumi District, Chiba Prefecture, it is called \"kitsune no shūgen\" (狐の祝言). In the Higashi-Katsushika District, Chiba Prefecture, it is referred to as \"kitsune no yometori ame\" (狐の嫁取り雨, the fox's wife-taking rain) like in Aomori, but this stems from the fact that this area was once a farming area, and seeing as how wives were noted for their labor, wives were thought as ones who existed to be \"taken\" for the sake of the prosperity of the family.\n\nFor sunshowers to be called this, there are various explanations, such as the explanation that for rain to fall even when the sky is clear gives the feeling like an impossible situation, one would feel like one is being tricked by something, and other than this, there is also the explanation that people believed that a fox's wedding would take place during a sunshower, as well as the explanation since mountain bases experienced a lot of rain even when the sky was clear, people thought that foxes made rain fall in order to prevent people from going up the mountain and seeing the fox's wedding, as well as the explanation that since there were wives who spilled tears even on a happy day, and they thus called forth such a strange weather as a sunshower, as well as the explanation that that the words used to describe the strangeness of the atmospheric ghost lights written about above was also put to use to describe the strangeness of sunshine when rain was falling.\n\nThe relation between a fox's wedding and the weather also differs by area, and in the Kumamoto Prefecture, it is when a rainbow appears, and in the Aichi Prefecture, it is when graupel falls that there is a fox's wedding.\n\nFox's weddings were not merely phenomena of nature, but also things that were actually seen in the old literature of the Edo period as well as various legends depending on the area.\n\nThere are various stories of strange wedding processions that were witnessed, and where there were actually foxes, like in the essay \"Konjaku Yōdan Shū\" (今昔妖談集) of Kan'ei period of one taking place in Takemachi, in the Honjo area of Edo, as well as the written work \"Edo Chirihiroi\" (江戸塵拾) where one was seen at the Hacchō canal in Edo, as well as the kaidan collection \"Kaidan Oi no Tsue\" (怪談老の杖) of the Kansei period where one was seen in the village of Kanda, Kōzuke (now Gunma Prefecture).\n\nStories of marriages between foxes that were shown to humans are disseminated country-wide. As an example, according to folk legend, in a legend of Sōka, Saitama prefecture, in the Sengoku period, a certain woman promised to marry with her lover, but died to an illness, and foxes were inspired by the regretfulness of this situation, and thus it is said that a fox's wedding procession could be seen near the woman's grave. Also, according to a folktale in the Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture), there is a story where when an old man helped a little fox, he was eventually greeted by the wedding procession of the fox when it grew mature, and as a gift of thinks to the old man, he was taken along it. In stories of weddings like these, natural phenomena like those written about above as well as supernatural \"kitsune no yomeiri\", function like stage settings, and weddings that take place in the day frequently take place in a sunshower, and those that take place at night frequently take place among atmospheric ghost lights.\n\nThere are also legends in various areas that one could see a fox's wedding by performing some specific actions, and in the Fukushima Prefecture, it is said that at evening in 10/10 on the lunisolar calendar, if one wears a suribachi on one's head, and sticks a wooden pestle in one's waist, and stand under a date plum, it is possible to see a fox's wedding, and in the Aichi Prefecture, it is said that if one spits in a well, intertwine one's fingers and look through a gap in between, one is able to see a fox's wedding.\nThere are also stories of weddings not just between foxes, but also between a human male and a female fox, and as a representative work, which also became a ningyō jōruri, there is the story about the birth of the Heian period onmyoji, Abe no Seimei in Kuzunoha. Other than this, there is also a similar tale in the Nihonkoku Genpō Zen'aku Ryōiki, as well as in the \"Tonegawa Zushi\" (利根川図志) a topography book published in 1857 (Ansei 5). The latter one concerns a commander 栗林義長 who actually existed who was comparable with Zhuge Liang, and the town of Onabake (女化, literally \"shapeshift into woman\") in Ushiku, Ibaraki Prefecture got its name from this, and the a fox is deified in the Onabake Jinja in Ryūgasaki of the same prefecture.\n\nAlso, in the Konjaku Monogatarishū as well as the \"Honchō Koji Innen Shū\" (本朝故事因縁集) published in 1689 (Genroku 2) and the \"Tamahahaki\" (玉掃木) published in 1696 (Genroku 9), there is the story of a fox who appeared before a married man, shapeshifted and disguised as that person's wife. Also, in the kaidan collection \"Tonoigusa\" (宿直草) published in 1677 (Enpō 5), there is the reverse story where a male fox fell in love with a female human, shapedshifted and disguised as that woman's husband and intercourse, and resulted in the birth of children with atypical appearance.\n\nThe \"Kitsune no Yomeiri-zu\" from the Edo period by the ukiyo-e artist Hokusai Katsushika was based upon this folk belief, and it depicted various people surprised by a fox's wedding procession and a sudden shower, and their bustle to take in their crop (refer to image). This has been pointed out to be an unusual example where the imaginary background of the foxes and the real customs of farming villages are depicted at the same time in a painting.\n\nIn a poem of Kobayashi Issa, a haiku poet of the same era, there is one that read, \"in the autumn flames and mountains, there is the rain of fox's weddings\" (秋の火や山は狐の嫁入雨). Also, in the works of the Meiji period waka and haiku poet Kobayashi Issa, there was a tanka that read, \"when the rain falls on the village from a blue sky at the hour of the horse, perhaps the king fox is getting married\" (青空にむら雨すぐる馬時狐の大王妻めすらんか).\n\nAlso in the ningyō jōruri \"Dan no Ura Kabuto Gunki\" (壇浦兜軍記) first performed in 1732, there was also \"it was quite clear weather all the way up to now, but then I heard it, the playful rain of the fox's wedding\" and in the period novel Onihei Hankachō published after the war, there was one volume titled \"fox rain\" (狐雨).\nOther than that, in Edo period kusazōshi and kibyōshi such as the \"Naimono Kuō Kitsune no Mukoiri\" (無物喰狐婿入) (illustrated by Kitao Masayoshi) published in 1785 (Tenmei 5), \"Mukashigatari Kitsune Yomeiri\" (昔語狐娶入) (illustrated by Kitao Shigemasa), and \"Anasaka Kitsune Engumi\" (穴賢狐縁組) (illustrated by Jippensha Ikku), as well as in Kamigata e-hon such as the \"Shūgen Kitsune no Mukoiri\" and \"Ehon Atsumegusa,\" there are depictions of \"foxes weddings\" of humanized foxes going through weddings. There was a genre of works called \"yomeiri mono\" (嫁入り物, \"wedding things\") of humanized animals going through weddings, but foxes had the special characteristic of concretely having the name Inari no Kami attached to them. This is seen to be an indication that faith in the god Inari as well as \"yomeiri mono\" both deeply permeated among the common people.\n\nAmong common people, in Akaoka, Kōchi Prefecture (now Kōnan) among other places, there is the children's song \"when rain falls in good weather, it's the fox's wedding\" (日和に雨が降りゃ 狐の嫁入り, hiyori ni ame ga furya, kitsune no yomeiri), and it is said that an actual fox's wedding precession was seen on a day of a sunshower.\n\nAkira Kurosawa showed the Kitsune no yomeiri in his film Dreams (1990 film), where Sunshine Through The Rain is the first scene.\n\nThere was also a song made called \"The Fox's Wedding\"/\"狐の嫁入り\" by Japanese music producer -MASA Works DESIGN- featuring the voicebanks of Vocaloid's Hatsune Miku and GUMI. The song is part of a series called \"The Story of the Kitsune and the Demon\"/\"狐と鬼の話\" (Also referred to as The Onibi series) which tell the stories of two families and the curse placed on the daughter of one family after the Kitsune, the daughter of the other family, was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the mother of the former's family.\n\nDue to the fox's wedding precession in Kirinzan in the Niigata Prefecture written about previously, the Kitsune no Yomeiri Gyōretsu is performed in the Tsugawa region, Aga, Higashikanbara in the same prefecture. Originally a place famous for kitsunebi, an event related to kitsunebi was performed starting from Shōwa 27, and it ceased once, in 1990 the sightseeing event with the wedding precession (yomeiri gyōretsu) as its core was revived, and every year, it flourishes with about 40 thousand sightseers.\n\nAlso in the Hanaoka Tokufuku Inari-sha in Kudamatsu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, in the Inari festival held in November 3 every year, the \"kitsune no yomeiri\" is performed. This is not related to either atmospheric ghost lights or sunshowers, but is rather a re-enactment of a wedding between foxes, and is due to the efforts of volunteers after the old practice of praying for good harvest at the Inari festival at that shrine ceased in the chaos of the postwar period, and the re-enactment refers to the fact a white fox couple at that shrine was looking for something lost, and was deified as a god of good harvest and thriving business. The ones who perform as the fox couple are selected among the people of Kudamatsu, but it is said that as the female who plays the part of one of the newlywed is going to be blessed with a good match, there is a benefit to a marriage at that same shrine.\n\nAlso, in the Suzakihamamiyashinemei Jinja in Miyado, Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, during setsubun, a shinto ritual called \"kitsune no yomeiri dōchū (the fox's wedding journey)\" is performed. This was also a ritual performed in the Edo period, but this was also a practice revived in the postwar period, and a man and woman who were in a yakudoshi or \"unlucky age\" that year would dress up as a little fox, the head envoy of the gods, and a girl fox, the envoy of the god of Suzakihamamiyashinemei Jinja, and then re-enact a wedding, which at that time it can be seen to flourish with several tens of thousands of visitors to the shrine.\n\n\n\n"}

The first state or territory based consumer organisation was Canberra Consumers, established in 1963 by Michael Vernon, Godfrey Linge and Bill Howitt. By the late 1970s most states and territories had their own consumer group.\n\nIt soon became apparent that lack of coordinated action by these consumer lobby groups was obstructing political change. With the election of Gough Whitlam and the Labor Government in 1972, the Government encouraged the disparate consumer groups to join together and form the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO).\n\nIn 1974 after a meeting of 27 consumer groups, led by the \"Australian Consumers' Association\" and \"Canberra Consumers\", a constitution was drafted and AFCO was officially founded. AFCO's foundation membership included \"Canberra Consumers\", the Country Women's Association, the Australian Consumers Association and the Consumer Action Movement.\n\nThe policy priorities of AFCO reflected the main consumer concerns of the decade. In the 1970s it was the establishment of product standards, trade practices law, social justice and the effects of inflation on consumers. In the 1980s the policies of interest for AFCO were product labelling, competition, media ownership and health. In the 1990s the issues were National Competition Policy, media ownership, environmental issues, product safety, tobacco control, financial services and banking and deregulation.\n\nIn 1994, for ease of reference, AFCO was renamed the Consumers' Federation of Australia (CFA).\n\nIn 1996, John Howard and the Liberal National Party Coalition won power. One of its first actions with regard to consumer affairs was the complete defunding of CFA. Prior to the election the CFA had nine full-time staff working for it. After the defunding decision, the CFA had only one part-time paid staff member. And after twelve months, the only staff members remaining were voluntary. CFA continues to operate to this day, but only as a voluntary organisation, making only limited contributions to national debate regarding issues affecting consumer affairs.\n\n\n"}

Located in Yarra Park is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and numerous sporting fields and ovals, including the associated sporting complexes of Melbourne & Olympic Parks. The park and sporting facilities are located in the inner-suburb of East Melbourne. In the late 1850s, many of the earliest games of Australian rules football were played at Yarra Park, which was known at the time as the Richmond Paddock.\n\nTree-lined paths run parallel to Punt Road and Swan Street, and criss-cross the park. Some of the lawns are used for parking for sporting events. Three footbridges allow pedestrians and cyclists to cross the railway lines to the different sporting venues and easy access to the Yarra River Trail.\n\nAround the MCG are sculptures of Australian sporting heroes including: Australian rules footballers Ron Barassi and Dick Reynolds; cricketers Sir Donald Bradman and Keith Miller; athletics \"golden girl\" Betty Cuthbert. Nearby is an old eucalyptus scar tree which shows a big scar caused by harvesting of bark for a canoe by the original inhabitants of the Yarra River Valley, the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation.\n\nThe adjacent Punt Road Oval, home of the Richmond Football Club features a statue of Tiger legend Jack Dyer.\n\nIn 1856, Victorian Governor Charles La Trobe proclaimed 81 hectares of parkland, extending from Punt Road to Swanston Street, and from Wellington Parade to the Yarra River. Initially the area was also used as police paddocks for the agistment of police horses.\n\nThe earliest recorded matches of Australian rules football were played at the Richmond Paddock in 1858. \"The Argus\" wrote the following year: \"Football, like cricket, has become an institution ... expect to see every available portion of Richmond Paddock, and other 'lungs of the city', dotted by animated groups in full pursuit of the leathern spheroid.\" It remained an important site for the sport until the MCG and other cricket grounds were opened for football in the late 1870s.\n\nBy the 1860s five recreational ovals were marked out: the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Richmond Cricket Ground, East Melbourne Cricket Club ovals (two), and an oval in Gosch's Paddock, south of Swan Street. In the southern section of the park land was set aside for the Friendly Society's Gardens (now Olympic Park), and the Scotch College oval. In 1874 Yarra Park Primary School was opened in the north east corner of the park. A housing subdivision was excised from the park in 1881.\n\nSince this time major excisions have been made for Melbourne's eastern and southeastern rail lines, the Hurstbridge railway line, Olympic Park Sporting Complex, Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park's National Tennis Centre. However, Gosch's Paddock still links Yarra Park to the Yarra River at the Morrell Bridge for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nIn 2007 The Government Introduced the 'Melbourne Cricket Ground and Yarra Park Amendment Bill'.\nSports Minister James Merlino told Parliament ‘The main focus of the bill, is to transfer responsibility for Yarra Park from the City of Melbourne to the Melbourne Cricket Ground Trust.’\n\nThe site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\n"}

They have cut many private music albums and also scored music for few feature films in Tamil cinema and Bollywood cinema.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, Hariharan and Late Gulshan Kumar's Hanuman Chalisa recorded under the label of T-Series crossed 1-billion views mark on YouTube - making it the first devotional song in the world to do so.\n\nAt the start of his career, Hariharan did the concert circuit and also performed on TV. He sang for a number of TV serials (e.g., \"Junoon\"). In 1977, he won the top prize in the \"All India Sur Singaar Competition\" and was promptly signed on by the late music director Jaidev to sing for his new Hindi film \"Gaman\" (1978). His debut song \"Ajeeb Sa neha Mujh Par Guzar gaya yaaron\" in that movie became such a hit that it won him an Uttar Pradesh State Film Award, as well as a National Award nomination.\n\nHariharan entered the world of Tamil films in 1992 introduced by debutant music director A.R. Rahman with the patriotic song \"Thamizha Thamizha\" in Maniratnam's film \"Roja\".

{"id": "1866454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866454", "title": "Alexander Galich (writer)", "text": "Alexander Galich (writer)\n\nAlexander Arkadievich Galich (, ; born Alexander Aronovich Ginzburg, , , 19 October 1918, Ekaterinoslav – 15 December 1977, Paris) was a Soviet poet, screenwriter, playwright, singer-songwriter, and dissident.\n\n\"Galich\" is a pen name, an abbreviation of his last name, first name, and patronymic: Ginzburg Alexander Arkadievich. He was born on 19 October 1918 in Ekaterinoslav (then Dnipropetrovsk and now Dnipro), Ukraine, into a family of Jewish intellectuals. His father, Aron Samoilovich Ginzburg, was an economist, and his mother, Fanni Borisovna Veksler, worked in a music conservatory. For most of his childhood he lived in Sevastopol. Before World War II, he entered the Gorky Literary Institute, then moved to Konstantin Stanislavski's Operatic-Dramatic Studio, and then to the Studio-Theatre of Alexei Arbuzov and Valentin Pluchek (in 1939).\n\nHe wrote plays and screenplays, and in the late 1950s, he started to write songs and sing them accompanying himself on his guitar. Influenced by the Russian city romance tradition and the art of Alexander Vertinsky, Galich developed his own voice within the genre. He practically single-handedly created the genre of \"bard song\". Many of his songs spoke of the Second World War and the lives of concentration camp inmates—subjects which Vladimir Vysotsky also began tackling at around the same time. They became popular with the public and were made available via magnitizdat.\n\nHis first songs, though rather innocent politically, nevertheless were distinctly out of tune with the official Soviet aesthetics. They marked a turning point in Galich's creative life, since before this, he was a quite successful Soviet man of letters. This turn was also brought about by the aborted premiere of his play \"Matrosskaya Tishina\" written for the newly opened Sovremennik Theatre. The play, already rehearsed, was banned by censors, who claimed that the author had a distorted view of the role of Jews in the Great Patriotic War. This incident was later described by Galich in the story \"Generalnaya Repetitsiya\" (Dress Rehearsal).\n\nGalich's increasingly sharp criticism of the Soviet regime in his music caused him many problems. After it was established in 1970, the dissident Committee on Human Rights in the USSR included Galich as an honorary member. In 1971, he was expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union, which he had joined in 1955. In 1972, he was expelled from the Union of Cinematographers. That year he became baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church by Alexander Men.\n\nGalich was forced to emigrate from the Soviet Union in 1974. He initially lived in Norway for one year, where he made his first recordings outside of the USSR. These were broadcast by him on Radio Liberty. His songs critical towards the Soviet government became immensely popular in the underground scene in the USSR. He later moved to Munich and finally to Paris.\n\nOn the evening of 15 December 1977, he was found dead by his wife, clutching a Grundig stereo recording antenna plugged into a power socket. While his death was declared to be an accident, no one witnessed the exact circumstances of his death. According to his daughter Alena Galich-Arkhangelskaya, that was a murder by the KGB. The results of official investigation were not publicly released by French police.\n\nIn 1988, he was posthumously re-instated into the Writers' and Cinematographers' Unions. In 2003, the first memorial plaque for Galich was put up on a building in Akademgorodok (Novosibirsk) where he performed in 1968. That same year, the Alexander Galich Memorial Society was founded.\n\nAlexander Galich, like most bards, had a fairly minimal musical background. He played his songs on a seven string Russian guitar, which was fairly standard at the time. He often wrote in the key of D minor, relying on very simple chord progressions and fingerpicking techniques. He had basic piano playing skills as well.\n\nGalich had a signature cadence that he would usually play at the conclusion of a song (and sometimes at the beginning). He would play the D minor chord toward the top of the fretboard (fret position 0XX0233, thickest to thinnest string, open G tuning), then slide down the fretboard to a higher voiced D minor (0 X X 0 10 10 12).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The fruit is spherical, of about 2.5 cm in diameter, and pale green. They are sometimes also reddish and split at maturity.\n\nDue to the Denmoza's long spines and column shape, it is a good candidate to create an amplified cactus.\n"}
{"id": "1866458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866458", "title": "Dark Sector", "text": "Dark Sector\n\nDark Sector, also stylized as darkSector, is a third-person shooter video game developed by Digital Extremes for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional Eastern Bloc country of Lasria, and centers on protagonist Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a morally ambivalent CIA \"clean-up man\". While trying to intercept rogue agent named Robert Mezner, Hayden's right arm is infected with the fictional Technocyte virus, which gives him the ability to grow a three-pronged \"Glaive\" at will.\n\n\"Dark Sector\" received mixed to positive reviews for its visual design, originality of action and weapon-based gameplay. Many critics have compared the game to \"Resident Evil 4\" and \"Gears of War\", for their similar style of play and story.\n\nIn \"Dark Sector\", gameplay revolves around the use of the Glaive, a tri-blade throwing weapon similar to a boomerang which returns to Hayden after each throw. The Glaive can be used for long-distance combat, solving environmental puzzles, and picking up in-game items. When in close proximity to an enemy, context-sensitive actions may appear, allowing the player to execute enemies with \"finishers\". Enemies also hold onto Hayden while attacking, and the player must rapidly press a randomly prompted button to break free.\n\nEnvironmental puzzles in the game usually focus upon capturing various elements (fire, electricity, or ice) with the Glaive. For example, a web blocking Hayden's path can be bypassed by capturing fire with the Glaive, and then launching it at the web to burn it down. The Glaive can also be dual-wielded with a gun, which allows the player to perform weapon combos which are more effective against shielded enemies. As the game progresses, Hayden and the Glaive are given several new abilities; it can be guided through the air, being able to kill multiple enemies (called the \"afterTouch\"); a charged-up throw for deadlier attacks (\"powerThrow\"); and the ability to make Hayden invisible for a short time (\"shift\") and also provide a temporary shield (\"shieldPower\").\n\nThe camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting, and the player can also take cover by standing next to an object such as a pillar or wall. While in cover, Hayden can move temporarily out of cover to fire and throw the Glaive; however there is no blind firing from behind cover. There is a sprint function, which works similar to \"Gears of War\"s Roadie Run, and simple melee attacks that allow Hayden to punch or slice nearby enemies. The game has no HUD (except for the ammo counter); Hayden's health is shown by the screen flashing red when he takes damage, as well as an indicator showing the attacker's position. If Hayden takes too much damage, the flash speed will increase, and a heartbeat will be heard, indicating Hayden is \"bleeding out\".\n\nMoney (rubles), ammo, weapon upgrades, and grenades can only be found in set locations, so they are impossible to \"farm\". Downed enemies drop their guns, though after his infection, Hayden can only carry these weapons for a few seconds before they self-destruct. Permanent weapons can be purchased and upgraded in black markets, one small weapon for his off-hand use with the Glaive (replacing the pistol) and one large weapon such as a shotgun or rifle.\n\n\"Dark Sector\" has an online multiplayer mode, where there are only two modes of gameplay:\nIn both modes, Hayden will have superior powers compared to the soldiers. Hayden will be able to become invisible, use the Glaive, etc., whereas the soldiers cannot.\n\n\"Dark Sector\" is set in Lasria, a fictional satellite country bordering the Soviet Union. In the prologue, set near the end of the Cold War, the Lasrians discover an American submarine off the coast. After opening it, a mysterious infection called \"the Technocyte\" breaks loose. In the game's present, the Lasrian military fights against the Technocyte victims, who have largely undergone extreme mutations and have gained frightening abilities.\n\n\"Dark Sector\" permanently casts the player as Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum). An ambivalent CIA agent, he has congenital analgesia, which renders him unable to feel pain. He is supported by Yargo Mensik (voiced by Jürgen Prochnow), a scientist and sleeper agent who knows the origin of the Technocyte virus. The main antagonist, Robert Mezner (voiced by Dwight Schultz), is an ex-CIA agent who seeks to build a utopia by spreading the Technocyte virus across the planet. Supporting Mezner is Nadia (voiced by Julianne Buescher), a mysterious woman whom Hayden knows; and \"Nemesis\", a metallic, humanoid figure who fights with a long Technocyte blade. Other characters include \"the A.D.\", Hayden's superior in the CIA; and the Blackmarket Dealer, an arms dealer who supplies Hayden with weapons and equipment for his missions.\n\n\"Dark Sector\" begins with Hayden Tenno infiltrating a gulag compound in Lasria. Hayden makes short work of enemy resistance to find Robert Mezner, the man responsible for ravaging Lasria with the Technocyte virus. Hayden proceeds with planting C4 charges throughout the building, before encountering a humanoid metal figure called Nemesis. Hayden is knocked unconscious after firing a rocket at Nemesis. Waking up hours later, Hayden finds himself face-to-face with Mezner. As Hayden attempts to reach for his gun, Nemesis appears and stabs his right shoulder, transferring the Technocyte virus into Hayden. Hayden detonates the C4 charges set earlier and manages to escape.\n\nHis right arm now mutated by Technocyte, Hayden arrives at a radio station to contact the A.D., his superior, for further instructions. The A.D. tells Hayden to meet up with their sleeper agent, Yargo Mensik, to obtain boosters for the infection. Shortly after, Hayden is ambushed by soldiers, just as his infected arm produces the \"Glaive\", which he uses to eliminate the hostiles. Hayden moves along the coast, slowly gaining new abilities with the Glaive as the infection progresses; while encountering both haz-mat soldiers and infected civilians. He also hears Mezner taunting him telepathically, saying that \"\"this change is inevitable.\"\"\n\nEventually, Hayden finds Yargo, who gives Hayden his updated orders and a booster for the infection. Hayden refuses the medicine, and learns that Mezner wants to recapture the infected with an old transmitter, which emits a signal that attracts Technocyte-infected creatures to its location, within an old church. Hayden also learns that Nadia, a woman Hayden is acquainted with, is also working for Mezner. Hayden moves on towards the church to destroy the transmitter, eliminating both Lasrian soldiers and infected along the way. Eventually, he makes it into the church catacombs and finds the transmitter. Nadia, who has a deep-rooted hatred for Hayden after his last meeting with her, confronts him. She leaves him to fight his way through a swarm of infected and escape before the C4 he set goes off.\n\nAfter making contact with the A.D. again, Hayden learns that Mezner is using a freighter to export the Technocyte virus from Lasria. After getting on the boat and fighting through the crew, he makes it to the cargo hold, accidentally releasing a highly evolved Technocyte monster, which sinks the ship. After Hayden escapes, he learns that Mezner's men have found and captured Yargo. Hayden rushes back to Yargo's post, where he finds a security feed of Nadia torturing Yargo, demanding that he let her into \"the Vault\", saying that whatever is in there can control the Technocyte virus. Disobeying the A.D.'s orders to stand down and await his arrival, Hayden sets out to rescue Yargo.\n\nFighting through a train station, Hayden finds Yargo, who has lost an eye during interrogation. After a brief moment of Technocyte-induced pain, Hayden attempts to use the booster, but Yargo starts to warn him about it, just before Nemesis appears. While Yargo escapes, Hayden attempts to take Nemesis head-on, but Mezner arrives and offers Hayden a chance to kill him; however, Mezner has grown powerful enough to mentally control Technocyte creatures, and begins to overpower Hayden. With no other choice, Hayden injects himself with the booster, breaking Mezner's control over him while simultaneously preventing further mutations. Before Hayden passes out, Mezner tells him that he had the same \"booster\", which was really meant to prepare the two for the Technocyte virus.\n\nHayden wakes up later in the Vozro Research Facility, where the Technocyte virus was researched during the Cold War. Yargo, who brought him there, tells him that he laced Hayden's booster with \"enferon\", a chemical lethal to Technocyte creatures. He claims that he was worried that Hayden would \"turn out like Mezner\", as they both had the same strain of the virus; however, Hayden has retained his humanity, while Mezner did not.\n\nYargo also tells Hayden that he can get a suit similar to Nemesis' in the facility's subbasement, which can give him a fighting chance against Nemesis. Hayden sends Yargo through the ventilation system, then makes his way down towards the labs where the suit is kept. After killing hordes of Technocyte creatures and bypassing automated security systems, Hayden discovers the suit; but before he puts it on, Nadia arrives outside the door. Hayden pleads with her to leave before things get worse than they already are. She says she's already in too deep, and that she will take Yargo to open the Vault, before leaving.\n\nHayden dons the suit and slaughters his way through infected and non-infected alike, finally finding and killing Nemesis, learning that it was actually Nadia all along. She apologizes for infecting Hayden and tells him Mezner is planning to transmit the Technocyte virus across Earth. Nadia then tells him that she knows he'll \"do the right thing this time\", gives him the key to the Vault, then dies.\n\nHayden works his way to the entrance of the Vault to rendezvous with the A.D., who says he has made a deal with Mezner and gives Hayden a booster \"for the road\". Outraged from being used and betrayed, Hayden stabs him in the neck with the booster, telling him that he now feels \"better than ever\", and kills all of the A.D.'s men before heading for the Vault. Finding Yargo, Hayden gives him the key, telling him to seal the Vault and dispose of the key. Inside the Vault, a stunned Hayden discovers the first known source of the Technocyte virus: an American submarine that surfaced off the coast of Lasria (seen in the prologue of the game). Hayden discovers Mezner with the Technocyte transmitter, a Hydra-like monstrosity. After fighting and defeating Mezner, the monster and several infected, Yargo arrives to tell Hayden that the transmission is still going out. Hayden tries to fry the circuitry with his Glaive; but Mezner, not yet dead, stuns his right arm, telling him: \"You are one of us now.\" With his right hand imobilized, Hayden catches the now-electrified Glaive with his left hand, and impales Mezner's skull with it. With the transmission finally halted, the game ends with Hayden leaving the Vault, catching the Glaive as he steps outside. Yargo, who apparently survives, narrates: \"That was how it started, the irony of this disease. That in all the others, it made evil; but for \"him\" [Hayden], it had saved his soul.\"\n\nThe development of \"Dark Sector\" was announced on February 11, 2000, on Digital Extremes' website. The game was originally proposed as a follow up to Digital Extremes and Epic Games' critically acclaimed multiplayer first-person shooter, \"Unreal Tournament\". However, the original plan was scrapped and the game was not spoken of for another four years, during which the game underwent a massive change in focus. The original design had the game keeping in line with its predecessor as a multiplayer arena-style first-person shooter. An in-game cinematic unveiled years later in 2004, gave viewers a brief look at potential storylines and environments, as well as the graphics of the game. Digital Extremes specifically stated that the clips were not pre-rendered and were actual in-game footage. The game was shown as the first example of what a seventh-generation game would look like.\n\nThe game was originally intended to take place in a science-fiction environment, in outer space, with players taking the role of a character that inhabits a sleek mechanical suit with incredible powers. The game was officially revealed by Digital Extremes' in late 2005, around the time of the original release of the Xbox 360. In 2006, major overhauls to the game were revealed, showing the main character, and a noticeably less sci-fi setting, although Hayden starts to resemble the originally planned main character as the infection takes over his body. The developers cited a shift in focus by other gaming companies and publishers as the reason for the change to a more modern setting and reducing its sci-fi elements; adding they wanted to achieve the realism that fans would enjoy. Another reason was that the tech demo was originally built before the team knew the maximum specifications of the Xbox 360. An interview with GameSpot revealed that the change in setting was intended to make the main character stand out more, as well as making the story more relatable, which they say has been written as a superhero origin story. He added: \"At the beginning of the game when we do the prologue he's just kind of this anti-hero kind of guy. And very simply, concretely in the game, there are certain types of barriers that he has to open with contextual stuff. And then when he changes, then he begins tearing those things off and becomes much more brutal. So what we're trying to do is convey that evolution on the inside, but also convey it on the outside so that those game elements that are around him are evolving as he does.\"\n\n\"Dark Sector\" was based on the Sector Engine, later changed to the Evolution Engine, both Digital Extremes' proprietary next-gen game engines. Official statements about this being just a name change or a major shift in their technology were not released to the public yet. \"Dark Sector's\" project lead, Steve Sinclair, stated that the engine was written from scratch. The producer of \"Dark Sector\", Dave Kudirka said when they first built the engine, they did not want it to look like the Unreal Engine 3, and they wanted their own perspective engine. When asked about the games' engine being made on the Wii or PC, he replied \"plausible\". The game went gold on March 7, 2008. The musical score of the game was composed by Keith Power.\n\nThe Windows version of \"Dark Sector\" was initially planned to be released on the same date as on consoles, but later it was dropped and there was no news on its release. On January 19, 2009, some sites reported that a YouTube video showed \"Dark Sector\" running on a PC. Later it was confirmed that the game was indeed ported to Windows and was on sale, though only in Russia and the language was Russian by default. Hackers found ways to run the game in English. In early March 2009, Aspyr and Noviy Disk announced the partnership in order to publish Dark Sector for Microsoft Windows, with March 23, 2009 being a targeted release date. Optimized by Noviy Disk for the release, the port featured improved graphics and a redesigned interface that made use of mouse and keyboard controls. An English/French version was added to Steam on March 24, 2009. The PC version's multiplayer mode is only available via Local Area Network play, as the game is a straight port of the console version with no extra code for internet connectivity.\n\nA comic titled Dark Sector Zero was released with \"Dark Sector\". Set before the game's main events, it delves into the events that led to Lasria's demise.\n\n\"Dark Sector\" received mixed to positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 73.24% and 72/100, the PlayStation 3 version 73.14% and 72/100 and the PC version 65.22% and 66/100. \"Hyper\"'s Dirk Watch commended the game for \"the Glaive and its aftertouch,\" but he criticised it for its \"patchy AI and steep difficulty curve.\" Greg Howson of The Guardian thought the game was similar to other \"Gears of War clones\" except for the Glaive mechanic which was entertaining, however \"the thrill soon palls, leaving you with a solid yet hardly essential action game.\"\n\nIn February, before the release in March 2008, the game was banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) for sale in Australia. Adam Zweck, the sales and product manager for AFA Interactive, the local distributors of \"Dark Sector\", told GameSpot AU that the game was banned due to its violence, in particular the finishing moves. \"Obviously we're disappointed in it [the decision]. We feel there is justification for an appeal. However, we're exploring several avenues at the moment to see what we can do to get the game on Australian shelves.\" It was later re-released in Australia for the PlayStation 3 on October 9, 2008, but the violence was censored. On July 22, 2009, \"Dark Sector\" was released on the cover disc of \"PC Powerplay\", an Australian PC gaming magazine, although this was the heavily censored version of the game. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that it sold less than it deserved.\n\nWhen asked about a sequel in 2008, Steven Sinclair of Digital Extremes stated that there was \"nothing definitive\" planned, but commented that he would \"love to do one\", and that \"Dark Sector\" only scratched the surface of the character and weapon's potential.

{"id": "1866464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866464", "title": "Ian Johnson (cricketer)", "text": "Ian Johnson (cricketer)\n\nIan William Geddes Johnson, (8 December 1917 – 9 October 1998) was an Australian cricketer who played 45 Test matches as a slow off-break bowler between 1946 and 1956. Johnson captured 109 Test wickets at an average of 29.19 runs per wicket and as a lower order batsman made 1,000 runs at an average of 22.92 runs per dismissal. He captained the Australian team in 17 Tests, winning seven and losing five, with a further five drawn. Despite this record, he is better known as the captain who lost consecutive Ashes series against England. Urbane, well-spoken and popular with his opponents and the public, he was seen by his teammates as a disciplinarian and his natural optimism was often seen as naive.\n\nAged 17, Johnson made his first-class cricket debut for Victoria in the 1935–36 season but did not establish a permanent place in the team until 1939–40. His career was interrupted by the Second World War; he served with the Royal Australian Air Force as a pilot and later as a flight instructor. He returned to cricket after his discharge and was selected to tour New Zealand with the Australian team, making his Test debut. Johnson was part of Don Bradman's \"Invincibles\" team; undefeated on tour in England in 1948. He was a regular member of the national side until poor form saw him left out of the Australian squad for the 1953 tour of England.\n\nJohnson was appointed Australian captain following Lindsay Hassett's retirement. The appointment was not universally popular; some teammates and supporters felt Keith Miller had a better claim to the position. In his first series as captain, Australia was defeated by a strong English team on home soil. The tour of the West Indies that followed was a cricketing and diplomatic triumph for Johnson. Australia won the Test series comfortably and Johnson's astute public relations skills helped avoid a repeat of the crowd disturbances that had marred England's visit to the islands 12 months before. However, his Australian team then went on to lose the 1956 Ashes series in England. Johnson's Test career ended with Australia's first Test tour of the Indian subcontinent, which occurred during the voyage back to Australia. Australia lost the one-off Test against Pakistan, the first between the two nations, before claiming the series against India. On his return to Australia, he retired from all forms of cricket at age 39.\n\nAfter retirement, Johnson worked for a time as a sports commentator, including covering the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. In 1957 he was appointed Secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, one of the most prestigious positions in Australian sport. He would remain in the role for 26 years, overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and playing a key role in the organisation of the Centenary Test in 1977. In 1956 he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to cricket; this was twice upgraded: to OBE in 1977 and to CBE in 1982.\n\nJohnson was born in North Melbourne, an inner suburb of Melbourne, on 8 December 1918. His father, William Johnson—a wine and spirit grocer—was a keen cricketer who played one first-class match for Victoria in 1924–25 before serving as a selector for the Australian Test team. \nAs a schoolboy, Ian Johnson excelled at a variety of sports. He participated in athletics and Australian rules football, as well as playing as a wicket-keeper for Middle Park State School. In 1936, he became the Victorian amateur squash champion. However, he found his vocation in cricket. In 1934–35, aged only 16, and still a schoolboy at Wesley College, Johnson played his first match for the South Melbourne Cricket Club First XI. \n\nHe was given the opportunity to play first-class cricket the following season, playing Tasmania—not then involved in the Sheffield Shield competition—just 23 days past his seventeenth birthday. He scored 34 and 26 and took two wickets in each innings as Tasmania won by six wickets. He was retained for the next game, scoring 15 runs in his only innings and taking 3 wickets for 40 runs (3/40) in the Tasmanian first innings and 1/27 in the second.\n\nHe did not play first-class cricket again for three years, finally returning to the Victorian side to play another two games against Tasmania in 1938–39, making his highest first-class score to date, 88 runs, in the second game. He secured his place in the Victorian team in the 1939–40 season, making his Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia in Adelaide in November 1939. Batting at number five, Johnson scored 33 runs in the first innings and 41 in the second, but was unable to take a wicket. That season, Johnson scored 313 runs at an average of 26.08 and took 13 wickets at an average of 39.92. In a season truncated because of the Second World War, Johnson played five matches in 1940–41, scoring 292 runs at an average of 32.44 and taking 25 wickets at 27.60.\n\nJohnson's cricket career was interrupted by the war and he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in March 1941. He flew Bristol Beaufighters with No. 22 Squadron RAAF and, by 1944, was serving as a Flight Lieutenant in the South West Pacific theatre. In June 1945, Johnson was awarded the King's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air for his work as a flight instructor with No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School, based at Benalla in rural Victoria. He was discharged in December 1945 and resumed his first-class cricket career in the 1945–46 season.\n\nFollowing his discharge from service, Johnson returned to first-class cricket in the 1945–46 season, winning a place on the Australian tour of New Zealand. The only Test match—the first between the two nations—was played at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. Johnson scored 7 not out and he was not needed to bowl as New Zealand collapsed for an aggregate of just 96 runs in their two innings; Australia won by an innings and 103 runs.\n\nTest cricket resumed in Australia with the visit of the English team in 1946–47. Before the Test matches started, the touring team played Victoria in a warm-up match. Johnson took 4 wickets for 38 runs in the English second innings but was unable to prevent the tourists from winning by 244 runs. He was included in the Australian team for the First Test at Brisbane, scoring 47 runs in the Australian total of 645. Once again Johnson was not given an opportunity to bowl as Australia won the match by an innings and 332 runs. Johnson took his first Test wicket with only his third delivery in Test cricket, dismissing Len Hutton caught behind down the leg side in the Second Test in Sydney. Making use of the breeze, in one 11 over stretch Johnson conceded only three runs—including eight maidens, taking one wicket. Johnson went on to take 6 wickets for 42 runs in the innings as England were bowled out for 255. Johnson, batting as a nightwatchman, joined Sid Barnes at the wicket late on the second day of the match, batting through until stumps. He was dismissed the next day having scored 7 runs in an Australian total of 659. In the English second innings Johnson took another two wickets; England were dismissed for 371 runs and lost the Test by an innings and 33 runs.\n\nJohnson met with less success in the Third Test in his home town of Melbourne. Batting at number six, Johnson was dismissed by Norman Yardley for a golden duck and, in the second innings, run out, again without scoring, giving him an unwanted pair. With the ball, Johnson took one wicket in the English first innings. In the second innings Australia were not able to dismiss England and the match was drawn; Johnson failed to take a wicket. Johnson returned to form with the bat in the Fourth Test at Adelaide. Unable to take a wicket in England's first innings, during the Australian first innings he made 52 runs. He dismissed Hutton again in the second innings, his only wicket of the match. The match finished in a draw, giving the Australians an unbeatable two–nil lead in the Test series and therefore retaining The Ashes. Johnson was injured and could not play in the Fifth and final Fifth Test in Sydney.\n\nA weak Indian team toured Australia for the first time in 1947–48, to play five Tests against an Australian team led by Don Bradman. The Indian team was weakened by withdrawals of their first-choice captain Vijay Merchant, as well as Rusi Modi and Mushtaq Ali. Furthermore, Fazal Mahmood had become a Pakistani, following the partition of India. Johnson played in the first four Tests, taking 16 wickets at an average of 16.31 runs per wicket. The Third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) saw Johnson's best performance of the series, 4/59 in the first innings and 4/35 in the second. Australia won the series 4–0.\n\nJohnson was a member of Don Bradman's Australian team touring England in 1948. Known as the \"Invincibles\", the Australian team was the first side to remain unbeaten through an entire English tour. Johnson started the tour well, taking 7/42 in an early tour match against Leicestershire, followed by 5/53 against Surrey. Against Essex, Johnson took 6/37 in the second innings. Earlier in the match Australia had scored 721 runs in a single day; Johnson made 9.\n\nHaving earned selection for the First Test at Trent Bridge, Johnson took only one wicket in the match; Australia won the Test by eight wickets. He had more success in the Second Test at Lord's taking three wickets in the first innings as Australia won the match by 409 runs. Johnson failed to take a wicket in a rain-affected Third Test at Old Trafford, and was replaced after the Fourth Test, having taken only seven wickets in the series at an average of 61.00. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" noted that while Johnson had started the tour well, he was not as effective in English conditions as Australian. Nonetheless, Johnson played an important role in maintaining the Australian team's unbeaten record, bowling more overs than anyone other than Bill Johnston—allowing Bradman to rest Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, his fast bowling pair, for the important matches.\n\nDuring the Test series in South Africa in 1949–50, Johnson took 18 wickets at an average of 24.22—only Bill Johnston, with 23, took more. Against a South African team weakened following the Second World War, the Australians started the series with a win in the First Test at Ellis Park at Johannesburg. The Australians won the match by an innings and 83 runs; Johnson made 66 and took 3/37 and 3/54. His best performance was in the Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban; 5/34 including the wicket of Dudley Nourse as South Africa was dismissed for 99. Australia, having made only 75 in their first innings, scored 336, including 151 not out by Neil Harvey, to win the match by five wickets. Australia won the series—Lindsay Hassett's first as captain—four Tests to nil.\n\nFreddie Brown and his English team toured Australia in 1950–51 to compete for the Ashes in a five Test series. Australia won the series four Tests to one; however \"Wisden\" reports that while \"Australia held a slight superiority ... the difference between the teams was markedly less than revealed by statistics\". Johnson had a \"mediocre series\", taking only seven wickets at an average of 44.42. His best performance was in the Third Test, when he took three wickets in the England first innings. He followed this by scoring 77 runs in a 150 run partnership with Keith Miller, who went on to score 145 not out. Johnson took another wicket in the English second innings and Australia won the Test by an innings and 13 runs. England's victory in the Fifth Test in Melbourne ended Australia's unbeaten run of 29 Tests since 1938.\n\nThe next summer, the West Indian team visited Australia to play five Tests. The series was billed as the \"unofficial cricket championship of the world\", following the West Indian victory against England in 1950. However, the Australians won the series comfortably, 4–1. Johnson had another lean series, taking only eight wickets at an average of 32.75.\n\nWhen the South Africans toured in 1952–53, Johnson was selected for Australia ahead of Queenslander Colin McCool. His selection was unpopular with a parochial Gabba crowd; when Gil Langley—who had replaced another Queenslander, Don Tallon—fumbled a stumping chance against John Watkins, they cheered loudly. Johnson was omitted from the side for the remainder of the series and was not included in the Australian squad to tour England in 1953.\n\nWhile the Australian team lost the Ashes for the first time in twenty years, Johnson spent the winter of 1953 calling Australian rules football matches for local radio station 3AW and writing columns for \"The Argus newspaper.\" Later that year, the Victorian Cricket Association appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria. In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form. Taking a confrontational approach, Hassett said to Johnson, \"The problem is that you are not getting stuck in. You're not trying.\" When Johnson protested, Hassett continued \"If you have got any brains, you will start taking this game seriously. Because if you do you will end up captaining Australia next year.\"\n\nThe other contender for the vacant national captaincy position was Keith Miller, the fast-bowling all-rounder and captain of New South Wales. Miller had led his team to victory in the 1953–54 Sheffield Shield and was recognised as an intuitive captain. Based solely on cricketing merit, Miller, a regular selection at international level, was seen as the superior candidate. However, inter-state rivalries and a perception that Miller would be a poor disciplinarian saw him passed over. This perception was partly based on an incident when Miller, as captain of New South Wales, allowed his teammate Sid Barnes to serve drinks on the field dressed in a three-piece suit rather than standard cricket whites. Johnson, on the other hand, was part of the cricket establishment: he was an alumnus of the exclusive Wesley College and the son of a former Test selector. He had also returned to form, taking 37 wickets in the 1953–54 Sheffield Shield—more than any other player—at an average of 16.37. In what cricket writer Dick Whitington speculated was a vote split between the New South Wales and Victorian factions, the Australian Board of Control appointed Johnson as Australian captain. His appointment was not universally applauded. \n\nJohnson's first challenge as captain was the Ashes series against England in 1954–55. In his first match as captain—the First Test at the Gabba in Brisbane—he led his team to victory, defeating England by an innings and 154 runs. It was to be the only Australian victory in the series. Injured, Johnson was unable to play in the Second Test in Sydney. With Miller also injured, Arthur Morris was asked to lead the Australian team against an English fast bowling attack including Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson, who took ten wickets in the match, was instrumental in England winning the Test by 38 runs. Johnson and Miller returned for the Third Test in Melbourne but were unable to prevent another English victory, this time by 128 runs. The Test was marred by controversy; Melbourne newspaper, \"The Age\", alleged that the pitch had been watered during the course of the match, in contravention of the laws of cricket. Following an enquiry, the Victorian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a statement denying any watering of the playing area during the match; however \"Wisden\" reported that \"large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more kindly to batsmen\". Certainly, Johnson felt the pitch had been changed to his disadvantage: \"It was like losing the toss twice over\". Johnson and Test debutant Len Maddocks shared a partnership of 54 runs to help Australia fight back in their first innings. Tyson ended the Australian resistance, taking 7/27 in the Australian second innings—England won the match by 128 runs. England won the Fourth Test at Adelaide by five wickets and therefore retained the Ashes. With the Fifth and final Test ending in a draw, England won the series 3–1.\n\n\"Wisden\" attributed England's victory to \"superb fast bowling by Tyson and Statham [that] turned the scales so that finally the Australian batsmen were completely humbled\". Losing three successive Tests saw the selectors of the Australian team subjected to harsh criticism. In the four Tests that Johnson played, he claimed 12 wickets at 20.25 and had a batting average of 58.00—inflated because of a series of not out innings; his highest score for the series was 41.\n\nIn March 1955, Johnson led Australia's first Test tour of the West Indies. The Australian Board of Control was concerned about the team's relations with the West Indian public. Against a background of rising anti-colonial feeling and resentment, England's tour of the West Indies the year before had been marred by riots and violent disturbances. With the White Australia policy in place at the time, the Australians feared an unpleasant reception from the Caribbean public. However, the Australian team proved very popular throughout the West Indies; \"Wisden\" reported that \"much credit belonged to the tact displayed by Ian Johnson, who proved a most able captain\". Johnson cultivated a relaxed manner with the locals; in one instance at Sabina Park in Jamaica, he stopped to pick up a toddler who had run onto the playing field during the change of innings. Smiling and chatting to the boy, he then carried him safely off the ground. Teammate Alan Davidson claimed, \"Ian did the best PR job of any captain I've ever seen\".\n\nAs well as being popular, the Australian team was successful on the field, winning the series three Tests to nil. The series was dominated by batsmen; in the five Test matches played the Australians scored 12 centuries while for the West Indies, Clyde Walcott alone scored five centuries—including centuries in both innings in the Tests at Sabina Park and Queens Park Oval. Johnson injured his foot while batting during the Sabina Park Test and was unable to bowl or field for the remainder of the match. In his place, Miller led the Australians to a nine-wicket victory. The Second Test at Queens Park Oval was a high scoring draw; Johnson scored 66 runs and took a single wicket. Johnson met with success in the Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown, Guyana. He took 7/44 in the West Indian second innings—still the best-ever innings analysis by an Australian captain—and Australia won the Test by eight wickets.\n\nA major rift between Johnson and Miller—erstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincy—developed during the Fourth Test, played at Kensington Oval in Barbados. During the third day, Miller, bowling fast-medium swingers, had dismissed Everton Weekes and Collie Smith in quick succession to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza batting. Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed. When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: \"I'll say who bowls and what they bowl\". With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall. Walking off the field at the end of the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he \"couldn't captain a team of schoolboys\", among other insults. Finally Johnson responded, asking \"If you want to go on like that why don't we go around the back and thrash it out?\" The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together. The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play. Their partnership of 347 runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record.\n\nIn the Fifth and final Test, the Australians scored 758 runs in their only innings—including maiden Test centuries for Benaud and Ron Archer, centuries for Miller and Colin McDonald, and a double century for Neil Harvey—to win the match by an innings and 83 runs.\n\nOverall, despite the team's victory in the series, Johnson's on-field contribution was inconsistent. While he took 14 wickets in the Test series, seven came in just one innings. His inconsistent form saw internal team tensions develop over whether his place in the team was justified; \"Wisden\" claimed that \"some malcontents called him 'myxomatosis' because he only bowled when the rabbits were in\". \n\nDonald Bradman wrote to Prime Minister Robert Menzies after the tour, recommending an honour for Johnson in recognition of his contribution to the tour's success. The next year, both Johnson and Miller were appointed as Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\n\nJohnson led his Australian team to England in 1956. The team's visit to England coincided with what was described by \"Wisden\" as \"the wettest of all summers in memory\". The poor weather gave the Australian team little chance to develop their confidence and Johnson used the early matches of the tour to allow his batsmen and bowlers to experiment in the unfamiliar conditions. In one of these early matches, Surrey defeated Australia by ten wickets; the first time Australia had lost to county opposition since 1912. In parallel with later events in the Old Trafford Test, off-spinner Jim Laker took all ten wickets in the Australian first innings; Laker and left-arm spinner Tony Lock took 19 of the 20 Australian wickets that fell in the match. While Johnson was successful with the ball, taking 6 wickets for 168; his preconceived tactics saw him allow Lindwall—his main fast bowler—only two overs in Surrey's first innings and attempt to turn Alan Davidson into a spin bowler. Cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Johnson's tactics throughout the tour, \"I have not met one good cricketer or cricket judge who is not mystified by them\". The manner of this loss severely dented Australia's confidence against spin for the remainder of the tour.\n\nThe First Test, at Nottingham, was affected by rain and, despite England declaring twice, the match ended in a draw. Injuries to Lindwall and Davidson meant an under-strength Australian team was forced to take the field in the Second Test at Lord's. In what \"Wisden\" described as a \"triumph of teamwork\", the Australians won the match by 185 runs. Johnson was unlucky to lose the toss in the Third Test at Leeds, because Lock and Laker were able to take maximum advantage of a pitch conducive to spin. The duo took 18 of the 20 Australian wickets and England won the match by an innings and 42 runs.\n\nThe Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch had little grass, perhaps as a result of earlier wet weather. Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his spinning partner, Richie Benaud were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459 runs. In reply, the Australians could not come to grips with the conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84. Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to follow-on. A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170 runs. Laker's performance was historic. He took 10/53, the first time in a Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings. With his 9/37 in the first innings, he had captured 19 wickets for the match, still a world record in first-class cricket. \"Wisden\" reported that the Australians were \"extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch\". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote \"This pitch is a complete disgrace\" while Colin McDonald later said, \"England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose.\" Johnson was generous towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: \"When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain.\" The media reported that Australia had been \"Lakered\".\n\nThe Fifth and final Test was drawn and Australia lost the series two Tests to one. Australia had now lost three Ashes series in a row, the last two with Johnson as captain. His own form was modest; he took only six wickets in the Tests at an average of over 50 runs per wicket. His performance with the bat was worse, scoring just 61 runs at an average of only 7.62. Once again, Johnson's place in the team was questioned. Acerbic cricket pundit Sid Barnes—a former teammate—joked that Johnson was \"Australia's non-playing captain\". Bill Ferguson, the Australian team's scorer, was also critical: \"Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was, in fact, a passenger, he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down. [...] There would have been no shame in standing down.\" Writing after the tour, Miller—a tour selector—stated \"Privately I thought that [Johnson] was not a form selection. On the other hand, I did not think it wise to change skippers in midstream.\" \n\nOn the return journey from England, the Australians toured India and Pakistan for the first time, with mixed results. On a matting pitch, unfamiliar to the Australians, Johnson's team lost the inaugural Test against Pakistan at Karachi. Responding to the loss, a cartoon drawn by Norman Mitchell of the Adelaide \"News\" newspaper suggested island planters might be able to scrape together a team that would be a match for the Australians. Returning to turf pitches in India, the Australians restored some pride. Johnson was the highest scorer in the Australian team's victory by an innings and five runs in the First Test at Nehru Stadium in Madras. Due to injury, both Johnson and Miller missed the drawn Second Test at Brabourne Stadium at Bombay; Lindwall skippered the side. Johnson returned for the Third Test at Eden Gardens, Calcutta for what would ultimately prove to be his final Test. The Australians won the match by 94 runs, giving them a 2–0 series win. S. K. Gurunathan, summing up in the Indian Cricket Almanack, wrote: \"The Australians showed themselves to be a superior side even when their batting failed\".\n\nWhen the team finally arrived home, Johnson announced his retirement from all cricket at the age of 39. In all, he played 45 Tests, capturing 109 wickets at an average of 29.19, including three five-wicket hauls. He scored exactly 1,000 runs, making him one of only fourteen Australians to achieve \"the double\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. In all first-class cricket, Johnson had taken 619 wickets and scored 4,905 runs.\n\nHis record as the Australian captain was mixed; he had captained Australia in 17 Tests, winning seven and losing five. However, he was better known as the first captain to lead Australia to successive Ashes defeats in the 20th century. Reviewing Johnson's time as captain, \"Wisden\" said, \"Unfortunately for him, he took over in the mid-1950s, when Australian cricket was decidedly inferior to England's for the first time since before the Bradman era\" but \"he was a fine cricketer and, in some respects, a visionary\".\n\nIn 1942, aged 24, Johnson married 19-year-old Lal Park, the daughter of former Test cricketer Roy Park. They were married for 56 years and had two sons, Bill and Bob. After the war, when cricket commitments allowed, Johnson worked as a salesman. Immediately following his retirement, Johnson spent some time as one of the first television sporting commentators in Australia, covering the 1956 Summer Olympics, held in his home town of Melbourne. He wrote a book; \"Cricket at the Crossroads\", published in 1957.\n\nThe following year, Johnson was chosen from a group of 44 candidates for the position of secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club. The position—previously held by Test cricketers Hugh Trumble and Vernon Ransford—is one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. During a time of \"dramatic change\", he helped to maintain the Melbourne Cricket Ground's (\"MCG\") pre-eminence as a sporting arena. Johnson managed the club and the ground through some major redevelopment, keeping a balance between the competing interests of Australian rules football and cricket. For services to sports administration, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1976. He played a leading part in organising the Centenary Test, held at the MCG in 1977.\n\nFor 20 years, he served as a member of the Victorian state parole board. After serving Melbourne Cricket Club for 26 years, he retired to spend more time at his home in the southern Melbourne suburb of Albert Park and his holiday house in Torquay. In 1982, his OBE was upgraded, when he was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to cricket. He died in Melbourne in 1998 following a long illness.\n\nUnusually for an Australian, Johnson bowled off-spin rather than the wrist spin normally associated with countrymen of his day. Johnson had an atypical bowling action, with a \"rather staccato swing\" of his bowling arm. He bowled with a high degree of flight, causing opposing batsmen difficulties in judging where the ball would land. Making intelligent use of the wind, Johnson was able to make his deliveries float away from the batsman, changing from his standard off-break. According to E. W. Swanton, Johnson was \"probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket\". His action was compared to a corkscrew; writer Ray Robinson saying that \"to coax turn from firm Australian pitches he twisted the ball almost hard enough to screw a doorknob off\". There were doubts about the legality of his bowling action; his English rival, Trevor Bailey claimed Johnson threw every delivery. Johnson was never no-balled for throwing, having played cricket in front of umpires from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, India and Pakistan. \n\nJack Pollard described Johnson as a \"dour middle order batsman\". He had a sound defence and when necessary could hit the ball with power. Bradman was full of praise for Johnson's batting after the \"Invincibles\" tour in 1948: \"Splendid batsman—most valuable about number 7\", also describing him as a \"very good slip field\".\n\nAs captain, Johnson was noted for his public relations skills and his gift for public speaking. He was optimistic by nature, with a belief in \"guts and determination\". However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: \"Just cos you are one of the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know.\" At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craig—his successor as Australian captain—was critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: \"I don't think [Johnson] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on.\" Pat Crawford felt \"Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [Miller]\". He was seen by some of his teammates as \"dictatorial\" with Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.\n\nJohnson was sportsmanlike; on one occasion in South Africa, when Eastern Province batsman Ray Connell was bowled after the ball deflected from his head, Johnson replaced the bails, allowing him to continue batting. During the Adelaide Test in 1950–51 he \"walked\", ensuring that the unlucky John Warr took at least one wicket for the series. Johnson was not above some gamesmanship, resorting to time-wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England. He was willing to have some fun on occasion; when in the West Indies he convinced a local pilot to allow him to fly the plane carrying the Australian team between Trinidad and nearby Tobago, to the later displeasure of the Australian Board of Control.\n\nNormally diplomatic, in a newspaper article in South Africa, Johnson was blunt with his hosts about race relations in the country: \"I am certain that the average man-in-the-street avoids the problem too much for, at the moment, you're living in a fool's paradise\". Urbane, courteous and popular with opposition players and spectators, Colin Cowdrey described Johnson as \"an astute leader and fine ambassador for cricket\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1866473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866473", "title": "Arthur Morris", "text": "Arthur Morris\n\nArthur Robert Morris (19 January 1922 – 22 August 2015) was an Australian cricketer who played 46 Test matches between 1946 and 1955. An opener, Morris is regarded as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. He is best known for his key role in Don Bradman's \"Invincibles\" side, which made an undefeated tour of England in 1948. He was the leading scorer in the Tests on the tour, with three centuries. His efforts in the Fourth Test at Headingley helped Australia to reach a world record victory target of 404 on the final day. Morris was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century in 2000 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nIn his youth, Morris excelled at rugby union as well as cricket, being selected for the state schoolboys' team in both sports. Originally trained in spin bowling, Morris developed as a batsman during his teens and during the 1940–41 season became the first player in the world to score two centuries on his first-class debut. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served in the Australian Army and gained selection in its rugby union team. Upon the resumption of cricket in 1946, Morris made his Test debut against England and quickly made himself a core member of the team. He made a century in his third match and scored twin centuries in the following Test, becoming only the second Australian to do so in an Ashes Test. His rise was such that he was made a selector during the \"Invincibles\" tour after only 18 months in the team.\n\nAfter the 4–0 series win over England, which was Bradman's farewell series, Morris became Australia's vice-captain and was expected to be its leading batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first series in the post-Bradman era, a tour to South Africa that saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By the end of the South African tour, Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. Later in his life, Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years.\n\nIn 2017, Morris was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nThe son of a schoolteacher who played for Waverley Cricket Club in Sydney as a fast bowler, Morris was born in 1922 in the Sydney seaside suburb of Bondi and spent his early years in the city. His family moved when he was five to Dungog, then to Newcastle before returning to Sydney in the suburb of Beverly Hills. By this time, Morris' parents had separated.\n\nHis father encouraged him to play sport and he showed promise in a variety of ball sports, particularly cricket, rugby and tennis. Aged 12, he gained a place as a slow bowler for Newcastle Boys' High School's cricket team. On Saturday afternoons he played for Blackwall, a team in the local C-grade competition. Morris attended Canterbury Boys' High School from 1936 to 1939 where he represented the school at cricket and rugby union, and was appointed school captain (head boy) in Year 11.\n\nIn his last two years of high school, he was selected for Combined High Schools teams in both cricket—as captain in both years—and rugby. At the age of 14, he made his debut for St George, and in 1937–38 he was elevated to the second XI. In a club under-16 competition, the A W Green Shield, Morris took 55 wickets at 5.23, which remains a record. The following year he was selected for the team as a batsman, after captain Bill O'Reilly decided that his left-arm unorthodox spin had less potential. O'Reilly described him as \"moderately skilled\" in bowling and noted that he would not have many opportunities with the ball as future Test bowling world record holder Ray Lindwall was also in the team. O'Reilly quickly moved Morris up to the No. 6 position in the batting order. After scoring a century against Sydney University, O'Reilly moved him into the opening position without prior notice, where he remained.\n\nWhile still at high school, Morris was selected to play for the New South Wales Second XI against Victoria in January 1939, his first taste of representative cricket. However, Morris made only six and three and did not gain further honours. After finishing his secondary education at the end of 1939, Morris became a clerk in the Prosecutions Branch at Sydney Town Hall. He was chosen to make his debut, aged 18, for New South Wales against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 1940–41 season, a season in which there was no Sheffield Shield cricket due to the Second World War. He scored centuries in both innings, becoming the first player in the world to achieve the feat on debut. Morris made 148 in the first innings and participated in a second wicket partnership of 261 with Sid Barnes; he added 111 in the second innings, completing his feat on 28 December. He gave chances that were dropped early in both innings, but impressed observers with his ability to remain settled. New South Wales went on to win by 404 runs. He was unable to maintain the standard of his debut in later performances, but finished the war-shortened season with 385 runs at a strong average of 55.14 in four matches.\n\nMorris' first-class cricket career was interrupted by the Second World War, when domestic matches were cancelled at the end of the season. On 5 January 1943, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and served in the South West Pacific, mostly in New Guinea with the 8th Movement Control Group, part of the Royal Australian Corps of Transport. During his time in the army, Morris spent more time playing rugby union than cricket. The coach of the Army and Combined Services rugby team, Johnny Wallace, regarded him as the \"best five eighth in Australia\". He remained a Private throughout his military service and was demobbed on 18 June 1946. Despite his eligibility, Morris was not selected for the Australian Services XI in 1945, something that baffled commentators, although he did play a one-off military match in 1943.\n\nHe returned to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was the beginnings of a productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: \"He was marvellous. If you had a problem, you could go to him and sort it out. I found him relaxed and straightforward\".\n\nAfter scoring 81 for New South Wales in his next match, against the MCC, Morris was selected to make his Test debut in the First Test against England in Brisbane. He failed in his first two Tests, managing just two and five, although Australia won both matches by an innings. Despite being criticised for having a \"loose technique\" by Neville Cardus, Bradman advised Morris to stick to his approach. Morris responded by scoring 83 and 110 in the traditional pre-Christmas match between New South Wales and Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the top score in both innings. However, he was unable to prevent an innings defeat. He was retained for the Third Test in Melbourne, but made only 21 in the first innings. If he had failed a fourth time, it could have allowed another player to claim his position, but Morris secured his place with his maiden Test century, scoring 155 in the second innings, and making the most of an ideal batting surface. After defending stoutly at the beginning of the innings, Morris accelerated his scoring, employing a wide range of strokes to reach 150 in six hours.\n\nMorris managed a century in each innings of the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 122 and 124 not out in extremely hot weather. This made him the second Australian after Warren Bardsley to score two centuries in one Ashes Test. With Australia having fallen to 2/24 at the end of play on the second day in response to England's first innings score of 460, Morris combined with Lindsay Hassett, who scored 78, to lead a recovery. After England's Denis Compton scored his second century of the match in the second innings, Morris put in another determined effort to ensure a draw. With the match secure, Morris played more aggressively towards the end in an unbeaten 99-run partnership with Bradman. Ahead of the final Test, Morris made 44 and 47 for New South Wales in a drawn match against Hammond's men. He made 57 in the Fifth Test in Sydney to end the series with an aggregate of 503 runs, at an average of 71.85, second only to Bradman. He ended his first full first-class season with 1234 runs at 68.55, partnering Sid Barnes at the top of the order at both state and international level. E. W. Swanton wrote \"Morris set himself up as a No. 1 for Australia for a while to come ... Arthur at his best looked out of the top draw, a left-hander with all the strokes ... and what the figures do not say is that few more charming men have played for Australia , and I cannot name one who was more popular with his opponents\".\n\nMorris started the 1947–48 Australian season strongly, scoring 162 in his second match as New South Wales crushed the touring Indians by an innings ahead of the Tests. He played in the first four Tests, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. In that match, he dropped down the order as Bradman used the tail-enders to protect the batsmen from a sticky wicket. Morris then came in and combined with Bradman in a double century stand. The selectors wished to trial other possible choices for the 1948 tour of England, including Brown in the opening position, so wither Barnes or Morris had to sit out. This was decided by a coin toss. Morris lost and did not play; he was given 10 pounds as compensation. Morris thus ended the series with 209 runs at an average of 52.25. Australia won the final Test to seal the series 4–0, and Morris ended the season with 772 runs at 55.14. He scored four consecutive half-centuries for his state as they reclaimed the Sheffield Shield from Victoria. For the first two Tests, Morris was paired with the recovered Brown, before the latter was replaced by Barnes.\n\nMorris, the recently appointed co-captain of New South Wales, had greatly impressed Australia captain Don Bradman, to the extent that Bradman made Morris one of the three selectors for the 1948 tour of England. Morris was a key part of Bradman's inner circle in planning for the tour. Bradman had long harboured the ambition of touring England without losing a match.\n\nMorris marked his first-class debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only four hours and made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult for the first few weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries before the end of the season.\n\nMorris' Test form peaked in the series, heading the Test averages with 696 runs at 87.00, and he was the only player to compile three Test centuries. After scoring 31 and 9 in the First Test victory at Trent Bridge, he was criticised by former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton, who believed Morris was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot. Morris scored 60 against Northamptonshire, before scoring 105 and 62 in the Second Test at Lord's to help Australia take a 2–0 series lead. Fingleton called the innings \"a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings\"; the knock was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. Morris featured in century partnerships with Bradman in the first innings and Barnes in the second innings, laying the foundation of a lead of 595 runs.\n\nAfter being rested against Surrey, the following match was against Gloucestershire at Bristol, where in only five hours, Morris scored his career best of 290. Having lost the opening two games of the series, England were contemplating changes to their team: Tom Goddard was tipped to replace Jim Laker as the off spinner, having been in prolific form in county cricket. The English hoped that he would be the weapon to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up. Morris' assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the pitch of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently went out of his crease when the ball was of a full length and rocked onto the back foot to drive and cut if it was short. On many occasions, he hit Goddard on the full. Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump. Morris stepped down the wicket, repeatedly lofting the ball over the off side. Morris reached his century by lunch and was 231 by the tea interval. By the time he was dismissed, he had struck 40 fours and a six. Fingleton said that \"Morris flayed it [the home team's bowling] in all directions\", while former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \"Tom [Goddard] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking] to him and that gets him many wickets.\" Australia promptly crushed the locals by an innings.\nMorris followed his effort in Bristol with two half centuries, 51 and 54 not out in the drawn Third Test. He then struck 108 against Middlesex in a tour match. Morris' century meant that he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.\n\nThe Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest; England started well with 496 in the first innings and took a 38-run lead as Australia replied with 458, Morris contributing only six. England declared at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs. When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin, 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 1/121. Upon resumption, Morris severely attacked Denis Compton's bowling. Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called \"indescribably bad bowling\". He reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs in the 15 minutes since lunch. He had become the first Australian to hit 20 boundaries in his reaching his century in a Test in England. This forced English captain Norman Yardley to replace Compton, and Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a fibrositis attack, Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided. Morris passed his century and Australia reached tea at 1/288 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having survived multiple chances and partnered Bradman in a partnership of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia proceeded to accumulate the remaining 46 runs to secure the victory by seven wickets.\n\nMorris was the batsman at the other end of the pitch in the Fifth Test at The Oval when Bradman was famously bowled by Eric Hollies for a duck in his final Test innings. Morris went on to score 196 in an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving before finally being removed by a run out as Australia reached 389. He scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took five wickets. With England having been bowled out for 52 in their first innings, Australia sealed the series 4–0 with an innings victory. Morris took four catches, including a famous dismissal of Compton, who hooked the ball. Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch, described by Fingleton as \"one of the catches of the season\".\n\nIn recognition of his performances, Morris was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949, described as \"one of the world's best left-hand batsmen\". Neville Cardus, his former critic, praised Morris' performance during the \"Invincibles\" tour as \"masterful, stylish, imperturbable, sure in defence, quick and handsome in stroke play. His batting is true to himself, charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful.\"\n\nMorris ended the first-class tour with 1,922 runs at 71.18, despite being troubled by a split between the first and second fingers of his left hand caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation, which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.\n\nWith the retirement of Bradman following the 1948 tour, Morris was regarded by commentators as Australia's leading batsman. In the 1948–49 season, he scored 1,049 runs at 66.81 in nine matches with six centuries and two fifties, taking his tally for the previous twelve months to 2,991 runs at 69.56, with 13 centuries. He scored a century in each of his first three matches for the season, making 120 against Queensland, 108 in Bradman's Testimonial and 163 against Western Australia. After a match without triple figures, he added 177 against Victoria.\n\nIn a low-scoring match against Queensland, New South Wales started the final day needing 142 to win. Morris scored 108 in only 80 balls, steering his team to victory before lunch. Previously, only Bradman had scored a century before lunch in a Shield match. The innings took only 82 minutes and Morris promptly returned to his work as a salesman. Morris rounded off his Shield campaign with 110 against South Australia. The Western Australian Cricket Association attempted to lure Morris to switch states, but he declined.\n\nMorris was appointed Australian vice-captain under Lindsay Hassett for a five-Test tour of South Africa in 1949–50, narrowly missing out on the captaincy after a 7–6 vote by the board. He scored two centuries in six tour matches before the Tests. In his first Test in his new leadership role, Morris was out for a duck in Australia's only innings as the team won by an innings. He made starts in the next two Tests, passing twenty but failing to reach a half-century on all four occasions. In the second innings of the Third Test, Morris played fluently to reach 42 on a sticky wicket before stepping on his stumps. Australia looked set for their first Test defeat to South Africa, but an unbeaten Neil Harvey century salvaged a win. Morris returned to form by making 111 and 19 in the drawn Fourth Test in Johannesburg. In between, Morris struck two further centuries in the tour matches, against Border and Transvaal. He finished with a score of 157 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth, laying the foundation for an innings victory and a 4–0 series result. He ended the series with 422 runs at 52.75. On either side of the final Test, Morris added centuries against Griqualand West and Western Province, and for the entire tour had amassed eight centuries, equal to Neil Harvey. At this stage of his career, he had amassed 1,830 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 67.77, with nine centuries. Following the tour, Morris received an invitation from the New South Wales branch of the ruling Liberal Party asking him to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming state elections, an offer that he declined.\n\nEngland toured Australia for the 1950–51 Ashes series and Morris started the season strongly. He scored 74, 101 and 78 not out as New South Wales won consecutive matches against Queensland. Morris then warmed up the Tests by amassing 168 for New South Wales against England. However, he made a poor start to the Test series by aggregating only 45 runs in the first three Tests, which included two ducks. Four of his five dismissals came at the hands of Alec Bedser, leading commentators to claim that Bedser had a \"hoodoo\" on Morris and he was called \"Bedser's Bunny\". In contrast to his struggles in the Tests, Morris played for an Australian XI and New South Wales in two matches against England during this period, and scored 100 and 105. In a match against arch-rivals Victoria, Morris hammered 182 and targeted Test teammate Jack Iverson, who responded poorly to being attacked. The match ended in a draw but stopped Victoria's challenge for interstate supremacy. The attack effectively ended Iverson's run at the top of cricket. However, on his 29th birthday, Morris again fell cheaply to Bedser in a tour match and he found himself eating at table 13 ahead of the next Test.\n\nFacing omission from the side, Morris recovered in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, where Hassett shielded him from Bedser. This helped Morris to settle in before batting for a day and a half to score 206, his highest Test score and only double century at the highest level. It constituted the majority of Australia's total of 371, which set up 274-run victory and a 4–0 series lead, and was his seventh Ashes century, ranking him second only to Bradman at the time for Ashes centuries. Bradman described the innings as \"faultless – a terrific Test double hundred\", comparing it to Morris's 182 and 196 at Headingley and The Oval during the 1948 \"Invincibles\" tour. Morris ended the series with a half-century in Melbourne in Australia's only loss, to give him a series aggregate of 321 runs at 35.66. It was the first Test loss he had played in after 24 matches for Australia. In contrast to his below par Test series, Morris was in strong form during the first-class season; he scored three centuries against England in the tour matches and compiled six in all to finish with 1,221 runs at 58.14. Despite these performances, the press continued to emphasise his perceived difficulties against Bedser.\n\nThe 1951–52 season saw the second tour to Australia by the West Indies. Morris experimented with his stance during the winter in response to criticism about his footwork when facing Bedser. Morris felt that his problems had arisen because he attempted to play excessively on the leg side. He opened his season by punishing the Queenslanders with a score of 253 in a Shield match and then scored 210 against Victoria. In the first of these innings, Morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team's 400, with the last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting. His Test form was unimpressive though; he started steadily, with 122 runs in the first two Tests, which were won by Australia.\n\nThe Third Test in Adelaide was Morris's first Test as captain, after Hassett withdrew on match eve due to a strained hip muscle. Australia were already one batsman short after the Australian Board of Control had earlier vetoed the selection of Barnes \"for grounds other than cricketing ability\", which was widely believed to be a result of Barnes' previous clashes with authority. Under board's regulations at the time, a replacement player needed the approval of the entire board. Since it was the weekend, some of the members could not be contacted by phone, and as a result Hassett could not be replaced by another specialist batsman from outside the twelve man squad. Instead, his place was taken by a specialist bowler already in the squad. This left Morris leading an extremely unbalanced team with four specialist batsmen and Miller as the all-rounder. Morris had a long tail with wicketkeeper Gil Langley and five specialist bowlers all with batting averages less than 23, and was reportedly \"in a state of shock\". Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a sticky wicket. Because of a leak in the covers, one end of the pitch was dry and the other was wet. Australia were bowled out for a low score of 82 but managed to restrict the West Indies to 105. In all 22 wickets fell on the first day, the most in a Test on Australian soil in 50 years. Morris proceeded to reverse the batting order in the second innings, with bowler Ian Johnson and Langley opening the batting. They were followed by bowlers Geff Noblet and Doug Ring, in order to protect the batsmen from a wicket that was still wet. Ring made an unexpected 67 and Morris scored 45 as Australia compiled 255, but it was not enough; the West Indies reached the target with six wickets in hand.\n\nAfter scores of 6 and 12 in the Fourth Test, he missed the final Test due to injury, ending an unproductive Test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23.25. The series was noted for Morris' difficulties against the spin duo of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin, who bowled left-arm orthodox and leg spin respectively. The pair was responsible for five of his eight dismissals on the tour. Morris did not play a match after the new year and ended the season with 698 runs at 53.69. He topped his state's Shield batting averages, leading from the front as New South Wales regained the title.\n\nThe 1952–53 season started poorly for Morris. He was replaced by Keith Miller as state captain, despite having scored almost 700 runs at a fast rate in the previous Shield season at an average above 50, and leading his state to another title. As was the norm for the era, Morris was not informed personally and learned of his demotion second-hand. No official reason was given by the New South Wales Cricket Association, but it was speculated among the media that his penchant for wearing brightly-coloured rubber-soled shoes could have upset the conservative administrators, and that Morris was too genial to be captain. The media made Morris a scapegoat for dwindling public attendances following the retirement of Bradman and lobbied for Miller, who they deemed to be more appealing to the public. Morris had led his state to two Shield triumphs, but remained national vice-captain ahead of Miller. Richie Benaud said that Morris \"led the side just as well as Miller but in a less flamboyant manner\".\n\nIn spite of this, Morris started the new season consistently, scoring four fifties in his first five innings, including 55 and 39 in his state's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests. The on-field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris' Test fortunes. He made only one half-century and a total of 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2–1. In the Second Test, he had progressed to 42 when he drove Hugh Tayfield into a close fielder. The ball ballooned to mid-off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball's trajectory and caught it. By the standards of the era, the catch was regarded as miraculous. He ended the series strongly, with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in Melbourne in the Fifth Test, which Australia lost by six wickets. Morris' 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix-up while batting with debutant Ian Craig, Australia's youngest ever Test cricketer. Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig's in a run out. His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years, and would have to wait another two years to reach the milestone again. Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new teammate. He ended the series with 370 runs at 41.11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide, that of John Watkins. The series ended 2–2, the first Test series in Morris' career that Australia had not won. Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm-up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45.65 for the summer.\n\nIn 1953, Morris returned to England, the setting for his three Test centuries five years earlier, for another Ashes series. In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey, Morris made 103 in eighty minutes. After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons, Morris warmed up in 10 lead-in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34.70. However, his performances in the first two drawn Tests, in which he struck three half centuries, indicated that might be returning to his earlier form. He was unable to maintain his form however, and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests, ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33.70. The teams were locked at 0–0 heading into the Fifth Test, and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at The Oval would favour fast bowling. However, they were mistaken, and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts' spinners cut down the tourists, while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands. Denis Compton pulled Morris' spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets. This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes for the first time in two decades with a 1–0 triumph, and Morris thus tasted a series defeat for the first time in his career. It was a low-scoring series, and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates, behind Hassett with 365 at 36.50. Morris' batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the \"Invincibles\" tour. He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket, that of Alec Bedser, in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Morris also struggled in the first-class matches, making 1,302 runs at 38.09 with only one century, which did not come until almost four months had elapsed on tour, against the Gentlemen of England. Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages. He made many starts, with 11 fifties, but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once.\n\nSpeculation linked his difficulties on the field to his personal relationships: during the tour Morris had fallen in love with English showgirl Valerie Hudson; he spotted her when she was performing in the Crazy Gang vaudeville show at London's Victoria Palace. The team was also hindered by tension brought on by a generational divide. The senior players, Morris among them, were retired servicemen who were drinkers, while the younger players tended to abstain from alcohol. The seniors frequently stopped the team bus to drink at pubs, leaving their younger colleagues disgruntled at the fact that the squad travelled at around .\n\nWith the retirement of Hassett following the 1953 England tour, the Australian captaincy was open for competition. No international cricket was scheduled until 1954–55, so there was a full domestic season in 1953–54 for players to stake their claims. Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, but was unable to maintain his form, passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings. He ended with 487 runs at 54.11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller's leadership. Nevertheless, the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris' XI, which played Hassett's XI in a testimonial match. Morris' XI won by 121 runs.\n\nAt the start of the next season, Morris was not made Australian captain despite being the incumbent vice-captain. Instead, he remained as deputy as Victoria's Ian Johnson was recalled to the team and assumed the captaincy. There was speculation that the two Queensland board members voted for Morris, the three New South Wales delegates voted for Miller, while the remainder voted Johnson. When England returned to Australia in 1954–55, Morris made his first Test century in almost four years during the opening Test at Brisbane. After English skipper Len Hutton won the toss and controversially sent Australia in, Morris made 153 to lay the foundation for a score of 8/601 declared and an innings victory. This included a partnership of 202 runs with Neil Harvey. The pair scored at a rate of nearly four runs per over, despite both players being repeatedly struck by the bowling of Frank Tyson, who was regarded as the fastest bowler of his era. Those were the only centuries made by Australian batsmen for the entire series, and Morris was covered in bruises; he deliberately used his body to fend off short-pitched balls rather than risk a catch.\n\nIn the Second Test in Sydney, Johnson and Miller were both unavailable due to injury; Morris led the team for the second and final time in Tests. The Australian Board of Control made the surprising move of appointing the young and inexperienced Richie Benaud as Morris' vice-captain for the match. Benaud, selected as a batsman, had scored just 195 runs at 13.92 in ten Test matches and was not a regular member of the team. Benaud noted that the situation was embarrassing and that Morris had asked him not to be offended if he sought advice from veteran players Ray Lindwall and Harvey, who had been Test regulars for seven years. Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a green pitch, in a match marred by time-wasting. Although Australia took a first innings lead, they lost the low-scoring match by 38 runs after a batting collapse in the face of a Tyson pace barrage on the final day. Aided by a powerful tailwind, Tyson bowled at extreme pace and the slips cordon stood 45 m away from the wicket. Morris had a poor personal performance, scores of 12 and 10, a disappointment amidst his team's defeat. He failed to pass 25 in either of the following Tests as Australia fell 3–1 behind with a hat-trick of losses and he was dropped for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 223 runs at 31.86. Aside from the First Test century, Morris struggled throughout the entire season, passing fifty on only one other occasion and managing only 382 runs at 31.83.\n\nMorris' international farewell was the 1954–55 tour of the West Indies. Prior to the tour, Miller replaced him as Australian vice-captain. He struck 157 against Jamaica in his first tour match, earning a recall to the Test team. He made 65 in the First Test victory in Kingston, Jamaica, before making his final Test century (111) in the drawn Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad. He made 44 and 38 in the Third Test win and then missed the Fourth Test with dysentery. He scored seven in his final Test innings in the Fifth Test, which Australia won by an innings to seal the series 3–0. Morris ended the Test series with 266 runs at 44.33. In his final tour in Australian colours, Morris totalled 577 runs at 57.45 in seven first-class matches.\n\nReturning to Sydney after the West Indian tour, Morris learned that his new wife Valerie had been diagnosed with breast cancer in his absence. She had concealed her illness until his return, fearing that it would distract him from his cricket. With his wife's condition deteriorating over the following year despite the removal of a breast, Morris retired at the age of 33, as he realised that his wife's condition was terminal and that their marriage would soon be over. Morris scored centuries on his first first-class appearances in four countries: England, South Africa, the West Indies and Australia, a record not equalled as of 1997. In general, he was known for scoring centuries in his debut appearance at many grounds. His eight centuries against England was second only to Bradman. He was a popular player, highly lauded by Australian and English commentators for both his character, goodwill and ability. His childhood mentor O'Reilly said that he was a \"man worth knowing\", while Tyson called him \"one of cricket's patricians...endowed with a genteel equanimity, without seeming aloof or less than cordial and friendly\". The English commentator John Arlott, known for rarely praising an Australian, said that Morris \"was one of the best-liked cricketers of all time – charming, philosophical and relaxed\".\n\nWith his wife's death imminent, Morris organised the couple's return to Britain with financial help from Hassett. He worked as a cricket reporter for London's \"Daily Express\" during the 1956 Ashes tour while his wife was reunited with her family for the last time. She died soon after they returned to Australia at the end of the tour, aged just 33. They had been married only 18 months.\n\nIn the wake of his personal loss, Morris, known for his sincerity and high personal values, received many offers of work and financial assistance. With a reference from English cricketer Doug Insole, Morris joined British engineering company George Wimpey for a few years. He then moved back to Sydney to take up a public relations job with security group Wormald International where he worked until his retirement in the late 1980s. He was appointed to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust in 1965 and served there for 22 years, eight of them as deputy chairman. During this time, the ground was modernised and the Bradman Stand erected. In 1968, Morris met and married his second wife Judith Menmuir. He was awarded the MBE in 1974 for services to sport. In late 1989, Morris and his wife retired to the town of Cessnock in the Hunter Region, north of Sydney. He continued to play tennis into his late seventies and enjoyed watching Test cricket although he refused to watch one-day cricket, introduced after his playing days, due to his preference for tradition.\n\nHe was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2001, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame alongside Bill Woodfull, the fourteenth and fifteenth players to be inducted. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century. Morris was named as an opening batsman in Bradman's selection of his greatest team in Test history. Bradman described him as the \"best left-hand option to open an innings\" and characterised his temperament as \"ideal\". Following the death of Sam Loxton in December 2011, Morris became Australia's oldest living Test cricketer, and after Norman Gordon's death in 2014 he became the third oldest surviving Test cricketer.\n\nMorris died on 22 August 2015 at the age of 93. His former Australian teammate Neil Harvey, the last surviving Australian member of the \"Invincibles\" tour, paid tribute to him as \"one of the best players this country has produced\" and said that \"you wouldn't find a nicer bloke in the world\".\n\nMorris was seen as an elegant and aggressive player, and is regarded alongside Clem Hill, Neil Harvey and Allan Border as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. Adept at playing against both pace and spin bowling, he was known for the variety of his shots on both sides of the wicket. Despite standing only five feet nine inches (1.75 m), opponents spoke of his imposing appearance and his apparent air of complete composure at the crease. He had the ability to decide on his stroke early in the ball's flight and employed an unusual defensive technique, shuffling across the stumps to get behind the ball. This created a perception that he was vulnerable to leg before wicket decisions and was vulnerable to losing his leg stump. Deft placement allowed him to pierce the gaps between fielders, and he was especially noted for his cover driving, square cutting and on-driving. Most of all, he was known for his back foot play, especially his pulling and hooking. According to cricket writer Ray Robinson, \"no other post-war batsman has rivalled his smashing counter-attacks on bowling swift enough to give the toughest team the tremors…A menacing bouncer colliding with Morris' bat was like a rocky fist against an iron jaw.\" While many batsmen tended to evade deliveries aimed at the head, Morris was known for standing and hooking. In one interstate match, Miller, one of the world's leading pacemen, bowled an entire eight-ball over of bouncers. Morris hooked the five balls that he faced in the over for 4, 4, 4, 4 and 3.\n\nAccording to Bradman, Morris' success was due to his powerful wrists and forearms. Bradman interpreted Morris' unorthodox methods—he often defended with his bat not straight—as a sign of genius. Ian Johnson believed that Morris' idiosyncratic technique was a strength, as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition. Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day, Morris had a penchant for lofting his drives, backing his ability to clear the infield. Benaud rated Morris alongside Neil Harvey as having the best footwork against spin bowling among batsmen after the Second World War. Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis of the length of the ball, and as a result, he quickly and decisively moved forward or back. Morris' productivity declined in the latter half of his career, something he put down to the break-up of his opening pairing with Barnes. Morris' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs, leading him to remark that \"When Siddy [Barnes] went, I lost a lot of support because he'd always get ones.\" Morris was also known for his unselfishness, often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix-ups while running between wickets, and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish not out to inflate his average.\n\nHowever, Morris was regarded as the \"bunny\" of English medium pace bowler Alec Bedser, who dismissed him 20 times in first-class cricket, including 18 times in Test matches. Bedser dismissed Morris more than any other bowler. Typically, Bedser took Morris' wicket with deliveries pitched on leg stump that moved across him. This perceived dominance is not borne out by statistics; Morris' average was 57.42 in the 37 Test innings in which he faced Bedser, and more than sixty in the 46 first-class innings when the two met. In their last meeting at Test level in 1954–55, Morris scored 153. The pair were very close friends, and Bedser frequently made the point of rebutting criticism of Morris' performance against him. Bedser noted Morris' gracious demeanour despite his struggles, recalling an incident during the 1950–51 season when Morris reached his century during a tour match against the English. Instead of thinking of his difficulties against Bedser, Morris commented on the plight of his English opponents who had suffered harder times. Morris stated that \"Bob Berry hasn't got a wicket and John Warr hasn't taken a catch all tour so I'll see what can be done.\" Morris was then caught by Warr from Berry's bowling without adding to his score.\n\nMorris took only two wickets in Tests, one of them Bedser in 1953; he was rarely used as a bowler and was a reliable catcher. Despite his success, he was a pessimist who claimed to be low on self-confidence, saying that he was always surprised not to be dismissed for a duck. In an interview in 2000, he said, \"I wish I had the confidence of some of the players today.\" After reaching Test cricket, Morris began smoking to relieve tension ahead of an innings.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866482", "title": "Lindsay Hassett", "text": "Lindsay Hassett\n\nArthur Lindsay Hassett (28 August 1913 – 16 June 1993) was a cricketer who played for Victoria and Australia. The diminutive Hassett was an elegant middle-order batsman, described by \"Wisden\" as, \"... a master of nearly every stroke ... his superb timing, nimble footwork and strong wrists enabled him to make batting look a simple matter\". His sporting career at school singled him out as a precocious talent, but he took a number of seasons to secure a regular place in first-class cricket and initially struggled to make large scores. Selected for the 1938 tour of England with only one first-class century to his name, Hassett established himself with three consecutive first-class tons at the start of the campaign. Although he struggled in the Tests, he played a crucial role in Australia's win in the Fourth Test, with a composed display in the run-chase which sealed the retention of the Ashes. Upon returning to Australia, he distinguished himself in domestic cricket with a series of high scores, becoming the only player to score two centuries in a match against Bill O'Reilly—widely regarded as the best bowler in the world.\n\nHowever, the eruption of World War II interrupted Hassett's progress. With first-class cricket cancelled, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, serving in the Middle East and New Guinea before being chosen to captain the Australian Services cricket team that played the \"Victory Tests\" in England during the months immediately following Victory in Europe Day. Hassett was the only capped Test player in the team and his men unexpectedly drew the series 2–2 against an English team consisting of Test cricketers. Hassett's leadership was intrinsic to the success of the team, which toured and helped to re-establish the game in England, India and Australia in the aftermath of the war.\n\nAt the advanced age of 32, Hassett began his Test cricket career in earnest and became a more sedate, cautious player who often frustrated spectators with his slow scoring. From 1946–47 onwards, he served as Don Bradman's vice-captain for three series, including the \"Invincibles\" tour of England in 1948. He then succeeded the retired Bradman as Australian captain in 1949 and presided over a successful team that gradually aged and declined. After an unbeaten tour of South Africa that saw a 4–0 triumph in the Tests, Hassett led the Australians to 4–1 home win over England in the 1950-51 Ashes series. The solitary loss in the Fifth Test was the first Australian Test defeat since the resumption of cricket after World War II. Australia's dominance of world cricket waned and, in Hassett's final season at home in 1952–53, it drew 2–2 against a South African team that was expected to be weak opposition. In 24 Test matches as captain, Hassett oversaw 14 wins and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Defeated in the last match of the 1953 series against England, Hassett's team lost The Ashes, ending Australia's 19-year ascendancy. At the age of 40, he promptly retired following a final testimonial match after returning to Australia. A cheerful character with a poker face that aided his captaincy, Hassett was known for his ability as an ambassador for Australia, his sense of humour and diplomatic skills. Richie Benaud wrote of him: \"There are others who have made more runs and taken more wickets, but very few have ever got more out of a lifetime.\"\n\nIn 2003, he was inducted into the Cricket Hall of Fame by the CA.\n\nThe youngest of nine children (six boys and three girls), Hassett was born on 28 August 1913 in Newtown, a suburb of Geelong, Victoria's second-largest city. His father Edward was a real estate agent who served as the secretary of the Geelong Permanent Building Society and was a keen club cricketer. The Hassett boys played three-a-side cricket matches in the backyard where Lindsay imitated his idol, the Test batsman Bill Ponsford. Along with two of his brothers, Lindsay attended Geelong College and made the First XI at the age of 14. During his five years in the team, he amassed 2,335 runs and was captain for three years. This total included an innings of 245 against Scotch College. In addition, he led the school's football team for three seasons and won the Victorian Public Schools singles championship at tennis. An elder brother, Richard, played for Victoria in the early 1930s as a leg spinner.\n\nWhile still at school, Hassett played for the South Melbourne First XI in Melbourne's district cricket competition during the 1930–31 season. A month after his debut for South, he was selected for his first representative match; batting for the Victorian Country XI against the touring West Indies team, he scored 147 not out. After being overlooked for further state honours for a season, he made his first-class debut against South Australia in February 1933, but his highest score in four innings for the season was 12 and he aggregated only 25 runs. He was overlooked for the entirety of the next two seasons. Recalled in 1935–36, Hassett consolidated his place in the team through consistency rather than tall scores, scoring 212 runs at 30.28, including two fifties, 73 and 51.\n\nThe following season, he led Victoria's batting averages, scoring 503 runs at 71.85. Despite his success, Hassett was unable to register his maiden first-class century, although he did manage seven consecutive fifties in nine innings for the season, including a 93 against Queensland and 83 against arch-rivals New South Wales in a consistent run that helped Victoria to the Sheffield Shield title.\n\nIn 1937–38, Hassett made 693 first-class runs including a century and five fifties at an average of 53.30, including another 90 against Queensland. Despite having only one first-class century to his name, 127 not out against the touring New Zealanders at the MCG in the first match of the season, he \"scraped\" into Australia's team for the 1938 tour of England.\n\nHassett allayed doubt about his selection when he began the tour with innings of 43, 146, 148 and 220 not out, against Worcestershire, Oxford University, Leicestershire and Cambridge University respectively as Australia won their first four matches by an innings. He added 57 and 98 in the next two matches against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Hampshire, and despite failing to pass 30 in the next four innings, he was selected to make his Test debut at Nottingham in the first match of the series. Hassett had an ignominious debut, scoring one and two in a high-scoring draw in which almost 1,500 runs were scored for the loss of only 24 wickets on a \"batting paradise\". He maintained his county form between Tests, adding 118 against Lancashire before scoring his only half-century in the Tests, adding 56 and 42 at Lord's in the drawn Second Test.\n\nThe Third Test was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain, and Hassett prepared for what would be the decisive Fourth Test by scoring 94 and 127 in consecutive matches against Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The match at Headingley in Leeds was Australia's only Test victory, which was enough to ensure a drawn series and the retention of The Ashes. In a low-scoring match in a batsman-friendly series, Australia, chasing a target of only 105 runs to win, had slumped to 3/50 when Hassett came to the crease as an approaching storm threatened to either end the game or make the pitch difficult to bat on. Hassett calmly hit 33 runs from 36 balls, to guide the tourists to a five-wicket victory, much to the relief of his captain Don Bradman, who was so nervous about the outcome that he could not watch the play. The innings earned Hassett a reputation of being calm under pressure, and Bradman later wrote that Hassett was a \"masterful player\" in a crisis.\n\nAfter the match-winning innings, Hassett failed to pass 31 in his next six innings before Australia lost the Fifth Test by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest defeat in Test history. He made 42 and 10 in the record-breaking match, and added a pair of half-centuries against Sussex thereafter. As he finished third in the batting averages for the tour, with 1,589 runs at 52.97, and the dry summer resulted in pitches mostly favourable to batting, \"Wisden\" found his Test performances, in which he made 199 runs at 24.88, anomalous:\n\nBenefiting from his experience in England, Hassett scored five centuries in his nine matches for 1938–39 and finished second in the first-class aggregates for the season. This included a run of seven matches in the middle of the season in which he scored five centuries and four fifties and ended the season with 967 runs at 74.38. He made 211 not out and 102 in two matches against South Australia, whose attack was led by Clarrie Grimmett, the world record holder for the most career Test wickets. Hassett also scored centuries in both matches against Queensland and another against Western Australia. In the first match against Queensland, he scored 104 in the first innings before adding 73 in the second innings to steer the Victorians to a narrow three-wicket victory.\n\nThis period of Hassett's career was notable for his battles with Australia's leading Test bowler, Bill O'Reilly, when the latter appeared for New South Wales (NSW). O'Reilly conceded that Hassett played his bowling better than any other batsman. Hassett's method was predicated on counter-attacking: whenever O'Reilly bowled his famed wrong 'un, he could read this delivery in its flight (whereas most other batsmen could not) and he advanced down the pitch to hit the ball over the fielders on the leg side. The disparate demeanours and physiques of the two men accentuated their rivalry. Ray Robinson wrote that O'Reilly, \"... towered nine inches above him; it would have looked more apt for Hassett to sell him a newspaper than contend with his bowling.\" The phlegmatic Hassett sometimes goaded the irascible O'Reilly, which few batsmen were game to do. On one occasion, he repeatedly mis-hit O'Reilly's bowling, prompting an irritated O'Reilly to ask if he had a middle to his bat. Hassett replied, \"I don't need one with you, Tige.\" It was a long, defensive innings of 81 against NSW (including O'Reilly) in 1937 that first brought Hassett to the attention of the national selectors. During an interval in the match, O'Reilly told his teammates: \"Nobody has ever kept me out like that little bastard.\"\n\nIn the 1938–39 season, O’Reilly removed Hassett twice in three innings in matches between the two states. Their rivalry culminated in two encounters on the SCG at the conclusion of the 1939–40 season. The first, between Victoria and NSW, effectively decided the winner of the Sheffield Shield; Victoria had won the first match between the two teams for the season. By scoring 122 in both innings, Hassett became the only player to score two centuries in a match against a team containing O'Reilly. Nevertheless, NSW won the game and the shield, before playing against a Rest of Australia combination. Batting for the Rest of Australia, Hassett almost repeated his feat by making 136 and 75, but this was not enough to stop NSW, who demonstrated their strength with another victory. Hassett had scored five half-centuries in the five preceding matches of the season, including three in four innings against Grimmett's South Australia, and ended the Australian summer with 897 runs at 74.75. He lost his wicket to O'Reilly in a first-class match only three times.\n\nOn 23 September 1940, Hassett enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF); despite his enlistment he remained active in cricket and played four first-class matches in the following 1940–41 season, scoring 384 runs at 54.86 including a century against South Australia, before his posting to the Middle East in early 1941. As a member of the 2/2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, attached to the Australian 7th Division, he was stationed at Haifa in the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel). During his time in the army, Hassett became popular among his colleagues because of his \"blithe spirit\". He was offered a commission as an officer, but declined. Hassett maintained his connection to cricket by captaining an AIF team against service teams from other Empire countries serving in the region, playing matches in Egypt and Palestine. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific, the Australian 6th and 7th Divisions were recalled to Australia. He married during his brief return to Melbourne in May 1942, before his unit was deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea to fight against Imperial Japan.\n\nIn 1945, with the cessation of hostilities in Europe, Hassett was selected to lead the Australian Services cricket team on a tour of England. Officially a military unit, the team's commanding officer was Squadron Leader Stan Sismey of the Royal Australian Air Force, although Hassett was the on-field captain. They went on to play 64 matches in nine months of cricket in four countries. The focal point of the campaign was a series of matches against England known as the \"Victory Tests\", which began in May. Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three-day matches as official Test matches, arguing that there were not enough Test-level players among the servicemen; Hassett was the only player who had Test experience, and only nine others had played first-class cricket. As a result, Australia were not expected to be able to seriously challenge the hosts, who had many of their pre-war Test players.\n\nThe Victory Tests were expected to usher in a new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured a large number of draws due to defensive play. Australia unexpectedly drew the series 2–2, and Hassett wrote at the end of the series that \"This is cricket as it should be ... These games have shown that international cricket can be played as between real friends—so let's have no more talk of \"war\" in cricket\". The series was regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 watching the bright and attacking play. In the five Victory Tests, Hassett made 277 runs at 27.70, including two fifties. The Services and Australian Imperial Force teams played separate matches in England during the season, which lasted until September, although only one other Services match was given first-class status. Hassett scored three centuries in matches for the Services.\n\nDue to the unexpectedly strong success of the Victory Tests, the government of Australia ordered the team to delay their demobilisation. With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via India and Ceylon for further fundraising matches for the Red Cross.\n\nHassett enjoyed greater success on the Services tour of India, although the Australians had little to celebrate as a team. It was a tougher proposition for Hassett's men, as all but one of the nine matches were against first-class opposition, and many of the players regarded the local umpires as being deliberately biased in favour of the home teams. After arriving in October, conflict hit the team after a series of ineffective displays. The team, mostly made up of RAAF personnel, had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent via long and bumpy train journeys for the first month. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was refused, they threatened to abandon the tour or replace infantryman Hassett with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller—who were RAAF fighter pilots—if their wish was not granted. With incumbent Australian captain Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services leader would be one of the frontrunners for the national captaincy. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team; after a month in India, their first flight came in late November.\n\nIn the opening match of the tour, a draw against North Zone, Hassett made 73. In a high-scoring match in hot conditions against the Prince's XI in Delhi, he struck 187 and 124 not out in Australia's 8/424 declared and 5/304. The team was scheduled to play East Zone in Calcutta, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. Australia batted first and made only 107, before East Zone replied with 131. Led by Hassett's 125, Australia posted 304 to leave the hosts a target of 281. On the final day, pro-independence rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch for the second time during the match, while East Zone were batting. East Zone batsman Denis Compton told the rioters to talk to Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett smiled at the leader of the irate demonstrators and asked \"You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would you, old boy?\" The rioters calmed down and play resumed.\n\nAustralia struggled in the three representative matches against India. Hassett made 53 in the first match in Mumbai, and although the Australians took a 192-run first innings lead, the hosts managed to hold on for a draw. The second match in Calcutta was an evenly-contested draw, before India won the deciding match. Hassett top-scored with 143 in Australia's 339, but the hosts took a first innings lead of 186 to set up a six-wicket win. Hassett ended with 235 runs at 47.00 in the three international matches, but did not taste victory in any of his seven matches on Indian soil. He scored 57 as Australia defeated Ceylon by an innings in Colombo before returning to Australia mid December. As time had passed, the players had become increasingly tired by the long campaign, and morale began to drop as waited for their return to their families and civilian life.\n\nJohnson's team arrived in Australia late in 1945, but the armed services and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. The fixtures were meant to revive cricket following the war and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946. As a result, Hassett could not appear for Victoria during the 1945–46 season. The Services performed poorly; after playing consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state. Hassett's team was saved by the clock against Queensland when the time ran out with the hosts four runs short of their target, but their fortunes were reversed in the final match when Tasmania hung on with only one wicket in hand to salvage a draw.\n\nHassett ended the Australian summer with 312 runs at 39.00, including three fifties. During the entire Services campaign, he scored 1,434 runs at 49.44 in 18 first-class matches and top-scored for the Australians’ whole campaign with 187. His aggregate was only 13 behind that of all rounder Keith Miller.\n\nBased on his form for the Services, Hassett was selected in the Australian team for a brief five-match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.\n\nDespite speculation that he would lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness and his ability to play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.\n\nOn the tour, Hassett made first-class centuries against Auckland (121) and Wellington (143) and scored 19 in the one-off match against New Zealand—retrospectively accredited as a Test—played at Basin Reserve in Wellington on a poor rain-affected pitch that saw the contest finished within two days. The match ended in an easy victory for Australia when New Zealand was bowled out for 42 and 54, but the tour attracted big crowds and made a record profit. Hassett scored 351 runs at 70.20 for the whole tour. By the time he returned home from the tour, Hassett had played cricket continuously for almost twelve months.\n\nThe following season, Hassett returned to serve his state and became Victorian captain for the first time. In the warm-up matches ahead of the Tests, he hit 57, 57 and 28 against the touring MCC team. He then scored 114 and 36 not out against South Australia in his last match before the beginning of the Ashes series. After a long deliberation, and against medical advice, the 38-year-old Bradman decided to resume as Test captain. As Brown was injured and O'Reilly had retired, Hassett was appointed vice-captain. The First Test at Brisbane revealed a more circumspect Hassett. He made 128 (from 395 balls in 392 minutes), his maiden Test century, and shared a 276-run partnership with Bradman, the cornerstone of Australia's match-winning score of 645. Although the crowd continually barracked Hassett for his slow scoring, Ray Robinson felt that he played a crucial \"anchoring\" role in support of Bradman, who initially struggled with his timing, controversially survived an appeal for a catch by Jack Ikin, then limped through the latter stages of his innings with a strained muscle. Hassett later joked that one of his brothers had his wedding on the day, and was waiting for the batting to finish before starting the ceremony, but could wait no more and proceeded, only to come back after the marriage had been completed to find that just one run had been scored in the intervening period and that his brother was still only on 97.\n\nAustralia went on to start the post-war Ashes era with a crushing win by an innings and 332 runs. Hassett made 34 as Australia won the Second Test by an innings, and the Third Test was his first Test on his home ground at the MCG. He made only 12 and 9 as England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand.\n\nHassett's other major innings of the series was 78 from 227 balls in the drawn Fourth Test at Adelaide. He added 189 runs with Arthur Morris after Australia, in reply to England's first innings of 460, were 2/18. At one point, the umpire denied an appeal by Norman Yardley for lbw against Hassett, prompting a frustrated Neville Cardus to write, \"... he deserved to be [given out]; the sight of a cricketer of his gifts continuing to deny his eye and technique in a Test match was enough to make any umpire go mad and, like the judge in Chesterton's story, administer justice instead of law.\" Hassett ended the Tests with 47 in the second innings as Australia stumbled to a five-wicket win on a deteriorating and spinning pitch in the Fifth Test in Sydney, in pursuit of 214. He finished the series with 332 runs at 47.43 and had difficulty against the leg spinner Doug Wright, who dismissed him five times in seven innings. He had added 126 for Victoria against Wally Hammond’s Englishmen just a week earlier.\n\nDespite his slow scoring in the Tests, Hassett was dynamic in the Shield matches for Victoria. In two matches for Victoria between the Third and Fourth Tests, Hassett hit 200 against Queensland and 190 against NSW; in both innings he scored at a rate of almost 50 runs per hour. Victoria won both their matches against arch-rivals NSW convincingly, by an innings and 288 runs respectively, and won the Sheffield Shield, having secured victory in each of the four matches that Hassett played in. Hassett was highly productive throughout the whole season, ending with 1,213 runs at 71.35.\n\nIndia embarked on its first tour of Australia in the summer of 1947–48, and the hosts won the first series between the two countries 4–0. After failing to pass 50 in the first two Tests, Hassett hit 80 in a rain-affected Third Test win, and then his highest Test score, 198 not out in an innings win in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, finishing the series with 332 runs at 110.67. Hassett was rested from the Fifth and final Test as Australia sought to try out new players such as Sam Loxton ahead of the tour of England. He remained in strong form for Victoria, scoring 118 and 204 against South Australia and Queensland respectively, but his state were unable to retain their title, losing three and winning two matches when Hassett was available. He ended the season with 893 runs at 68.69.\n\nTen years after his first tour of England, Hassett was included in the 1948 team as Bradman's deputy. Hassett was one of three on-tour selectors along with Bradman and Arthur Morris. Considered one of the strongest Australia teams to tour England, the team became known as \"The Invincibles\" because it went undefeated through 34 matches, an unprecedented feat. As matches often started the day after the previous fixture, Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine of the 34 matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost.\n\nHassett had two close encounters as captain, both on damp pitches before the First Test when Australia's unbeaten record was challenged. Against Yorkshire in the third match of the tour, Australia came the closest to losing for the entire tour. In a low-scoring match in which neither team posted more than 101, Australia was set 60 for victory, Hassett elected not to ask for the pitch to be rolled. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett \"might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [erratic bounce and sideways movement] out of the pitch\". Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2/5. After being involved in a run out, he fell to leave Australia at 5/20. Australia lost another wicket to be 6/31, effectively seven down with Sam Loxton incapacitated by injury, but scraped hom without further loss after both batsmen at the crease were dropped. It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912. In the 11th match of the tour against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour. On a drying pitch, Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195. Australia had made a solid start, before Hassett fell for 26, sparking a collapse of 8/47 to be all out for 117. Hampshire were then bowled out for 103, leaving Australia a target of 182, which they reached to seal an eight-wicket win.\n\nThe two matches aside, Hassett had a productive lead-in to the Tests, scoring 110 against Surrey and two fifties. One of these came in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and was basically a full-strength Test team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. Australia batted first and Hassett made 51 in an innings win. Fingleton hailed Hassett's display as \"the prettiest half century we saw in the whole summer. There was not effort in his play. The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions.\"\n\nIn the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett came in on the second day with Australia at 4/185 in reply to England's 165. Australia had been scoring slowly due to England's use of leg theory. Hassett almost holed out early when he edged a ball just wide of the wicket-keeper. Hassett and Bradman were heckled for their slow batting but they remained unhurried in the face of England's stifling tactics Australia had plenty of time after bowling out their opponents easily. Hassett had a period of 20 minutes without scoring.\n\nEarly on the third day, Bradman fell for 138 with the score at 5/305. Yardley again pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and employed a pure ring field. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. The injured Ray Lindwall came out to join Hassett at 7/365 without a runner. Hassett—who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the morning—swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley's defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result. After the break, Hassett reached his first Test century on English soil. from 305 minutes. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes, before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. This ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall with the score at 8/473; Australia ended at 509 to take a 344-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21 in an eight-wicket win.\n\nThe First Test set the tone for the series, and ahead of the next Test, Hassett top scored with 127 and took five catches in an innings win over Northamptonshire. Hassett scored 47 and a duck in the Second Test at Lord's, having been dropped three times in the first innings as Australia went on to a 409-run win. Hassett then struck 139 against Surrey, his second century against the county in as many matches. Hassett and Australia were in difficulty in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Hassett made 38 as Australia scored 221 in reply to 363. In England's second innings, Hassett twice dropped Cyril Washbrook in the same position from the same shot. After the third day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position, 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand. Luckily for Australia and Hassett, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition after the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to ensure a draw.\n\nHassett had a new role as the teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. He would improvise and open with Morris, as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who went on to score 81—on 25. Hassett struggled to make an impact in the unfamiliar role, scoring 13 and 17. However, the other Australian batsmen stepped up and scored 3/404 in 330 minutes on the final day to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead. Hassett scored two fifties in the lead-up to the Fifth Test, where he returned to his customary role with the return of Barnes. Hassett took a diving catch in the first innings and scored 37 in an innings win. Australia thus won the series convincingly 4–0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44.29.\n\nAfter the Tests, seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. played in four of the matches and was in fine form, hitting three consecutive centuries. Against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's, Hassett made 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players. He then made 103 against Somerset and 151 against the South of England. Australia won the first two and were denied by rain in the third.\n\nHassett ended the first-class matches with 1,563 runs at 74.22 and seven centuries. He had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Morris and the second highest average. In recognition of his performances in England, he was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949. \"Wisden\" opined that \"in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman's busy shoulders\".\n\nBy virtue of his performances with the Services team and his seniority in Australian cricket, Hassett appeared certain to succeed Bradman as captain; his only rival for the position was NSW captain Arthur Morris, the third selector during the tour of England. The season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team, started with Bradman's testimonial match, in which Hassett led a team against the retiring Australian leader. Hassett scored 35 and 102 and the match ended with the scores tied. Bradman's outfit managed to fall short of the victory by the smallest possible margin, ending one run short of their target with one wicket remaining at the end of the final over. Hassett continued his liking for the Queensland attack, scoring 104 and 205 in Victoria's two matches against their northern opponents for the year. Victoria did not do so well as a team, winning two and losing one of the six matches in which Hassett played, as New South Wales took the title. The summer finished with Hassett captaining a team against an eleven led by Morris. The match was designated as a trial for the selection of the Australian team to tour South Africa the following summer. Hassett scored 73 and 159 and top-scored in both innings; Morris 66 and 12. However, Hassett's effort was not enough to stop an eight-wicket defeat after Morris's men took a 377-run first innings lead. Morris and Hassett were the first and third highest run-scorers for the 1948–49 season. Hassett ended the season with 855 runs at 61.07.\n\nThe day after the match, the chosen touring team was passed to the Board of Control for a decision on the captaincy. The 7–6 result in favour of Hassett provoked Ray Robinson to write that the deciding vote, cast for Hassett by the Board chairman Dr Allen Robertson (from Victoria), \"... save[d] the Board from an act of disgusting ingratitude\" and that, \"... once again Hassett's notable achievements with the Services team had been devalued.\" The main reason given for the administrators' less than unanimous endorsement of Hassett was his religion. As an Irish Catholic, Hassett was subjected to the sectarian bias of some Australian cricket officials, an attitude that was common among the Anglo-Saxon Protestant ruling class of the time, and so narrowly became the first Catholic captain since Percy McDonnell in 1888.\nThe team itself was significantly different from the Invincibles squad. Bradman had retired; Sid Barnes, Don Tallon, Ernie Toshack and Bill Brown were unavailable, while the omission of Keith Miller caused a furore. Miller later joined the tour after an injury sustained in a car crash sidelined Bill Johnston for an extended period at the start of the tour. However, Johnston recovered, and both he and Miller took their places in all five Tests, eliminating any disadvantage caused by the controversial initial omission of the latter.\n\nMatching Bradman's feat, Hassett led his team through South Africa undefeated and claimed the Test series 4–0, winning 14 out of 21 matches. Although he was hampered by recurrent problems with his tonsils, the success of the tour was attributed to Hassett's, \"... unobtrusive yet dominant personality.\" He scored 889 first-class runs at 68.38 on the tour, including four centuries. In the lead-up to the Tests, Hassett scored 100 and 96, and he led Australia to four consecutive wins, three by an innings and the other by ten wickets.\n\nThe opening Test began at Johannesburg on Christmas Eve 1949. Batting first, Australia started poorly when both opening batsmen failed to score, before Hassett \"transformed the course of the game with a hundred of considerable quality.\" He compiled 112 (in 261 minutes) of the 198 runs added while he was at the crease; Australia amassed 413 then bowled South Africa out twice to win by an innings. He then scored 57 and enforced the follow on in an eight-wicket win in the Second Test.\n\nHassett's winning run looked at an end when Australia was exposed to a sticky wicket in the Third Test. The hosts had reached 2/240 at the end of the first day before rain hit and made the pitch extremely difficult for batting. The next day, Hassett had to waste time to keep South Africa batting on the poor surface so that Australia's batsmen would not be exposed to the worst conditions. He then told his bowlers to perform badly so that the hosts would not realise how difficult the pitch was and declare so that Australia would have to face the sticky wicket. Despite Hassett's subterfuge, the pitch was so poor that South Africa fell to be 311 all out, but Australia had gained extra time. The tourists made only 75, but then dismissed the hosts for 99, Hassett using defensive tactics to slow the scoring and keep South Africa batting as the pitch slowly improved. Australia chased down the target of 336 with five wickets in hand to secure a highly unlikely win. The local newspaper, \"The Natal Mercury\" said that \"Renowned for their fighting qualities as a cricketers, the occasion brought the best out of the Australians ... That indomitable spirit to win through, no matter what the circumstances may be, was in most marked evidence.\"\n\nHassett's perfect record as Test captain ended in the Fourth Test, when he made 53 in a high-scoring draw. He then \"reached peak form\" in the final Test at Port Elizabeth. He top-scored with 167 as the match unfolded in a similar manner to the First Test, with a similar result. Australia made 7/549 declared and then won by an innings and 259 runs after enforcing the follow on.\n\nAs a leader, Hassett was regarded as an outstanding success. In that era, the tours were accompanied by much ceremony, and captains were expected to make many appearances with dignitaries at dinner parties and make speeches. He had his players participate in cultural activities such as dancing and singing with indigenous tribesmen, and reached out to the local children, interspersing his presentations with self-deprecating jibes. As the team's boat departed for home, Hassett tossed his remaining money away among the local children. The Australian High Commission hailed him as the most effective Australian diplomat to have visited South Africa. Of his on-field performances, the historian Chris Harte wrote that \"Hassett’s captaincy impressed from the start. His warmth of personality and sense of fun contrasted with Bradman’s efficient but cold methods. It was a happy tour with the players remembering particularly the hospitality offered to them.\"\n\nHassett started the 1950–51 season strongly; after making 19 against England for Victoria, he struck 113 and 179 against South Australia and New South Wales in his two other matches before the Tests.\n\nThe England team that visited Australia for the 1950–51 Ashes series had a poor start to their tour, but at Brisbane on the opening day of the First Test, \"... surprised even themselves by dismissing Australia for 228 on a good pitch.\" However, rain intervened to negate England's advantage, and when the contest resumed two days later, England batted on a sticky wicket. The English captain Freddie Brown conceded a first-innings lead of 160 runs by declaring with his team's score on 7/68 to force Australia to bat in unfavourable conditions. The Australian batsmen fared worse in the difficult conditions and Hassett gambled by declaring at 7/32, setting England 193 to win. Hassett himself had only managed eight and three for the match. During the 70 minutes remaining before stumps, Australia took six English wickets (which meant that 20 wickets fell for 102 runs in the day's play), and went on to win the match by 70 runs the following day. Hassett returned to his normal form away from the sticky wicket, scoring 127 and 28 not out against Queensland between Tests. It was his third century in as many matches for Victoria.\n\nIn the Second Test at Melbourne, \"Australia owed much to the imperturbable Hassett\", as he top-scored with 52 in the first innings. Australia won another low-scoring match by 28 runs; Freddie Brown was the only other player to post a half century in the match and no team passed 200. Hassett then stroked 70 in the Third Test, which Australia won by an innings to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead, before Australia won their fifth Test in a row in the next match in Adelaide.\n\nBefore the final Test, Hassett's run-scoring peaked when he stroked 232 against Brown's men in a drawn match for Victoria. In the Fifth Test at the MCG, he top-scored with 92 before his dismissal to a one-handed diving catch sparked a collapse and Australia managed only 217 batting first. The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia's second innings of 197. England made the 95 needed for victory, and the eight-wicket loss was Australia's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II, ending a streak of 25 Tests without defeat. Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in, but despite the success on the field, the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25% from the corresponding tour four years earlier, mainly due to the absence of Bradman to spark public interest.\n\nHassett was the second-highest run-scorer of the series, hitting 366 runs at 40.67. Only England's Len Hutton (533 runs at 88.83) was better. Hassett ended the first-class season with 1,423 runs at 64.68, including four centuries and five fifties, topping the run-scoring aggregates. He played in seven shield matches without defeat, winning five to help Victoria to another title.\n\n\"Wisden\", taking into consideration Australia's post-war record and the West Indies' success during their 1950 tour of England, declared the 1951–52 series between the two sides to be, \"the unofficial cricket championship of the world\". Hassett went into the First Test at Brisbane without playing a first-class match for the season due to the scheduling. However, this was negated by the fact that the tourists only had one match of comparable standard before the Tests, prompting Hassett to make some unusually blunt comments, saying that \"The West Indies have suffered from sheer stupidity in the organisation of their tour\". Like many of the Australians, he struggled to pick the action of West Indian leg spinner Sonny Ramadhin. He was out for only six in the first innings, as Australia eked out a 10-run lead. He then managed 35 as Australia scraped home in the second innings by three wickets to 7/236. He had been dismissed by Ramadhin both times, bowled and lbw, unable to pick which way the ball was spinning. Between Tests, Hassett had an opportunity to rectify this problem when Victoria hosted the Caribbean tourists, but Ramadhin prevailed again, dismissing him for 12 in his only innings. Having worked out how to pick Ramadhin's variations, he compiled 132 and 46 not out in a seven-wicket win in the Second Test at Sydney. Hassett's century was part of a 235-run partnership with Keith Miller, an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies. Ramadhin ended with 1/196 and was demoralised. Between Tests, Hassett's Victorians faced New South Wales in consecutive matches. Hassett scored 92 in the first encounter, a high-scoring draw, and his team had the upper hand in the latter, forcing their opponents to hold on with only three wickets remaining.\n\nHassett missed the next Test with a strained muscle; this led to a bureaucratic restriction that hindered his deputy Morris. Having been injured on the eve of the Test, Hassett's withdrawal forced the selectors to call in batsman Phil Ridings at late notice, but some of the board members could not be contacted to ratify the decision. This meant that Hassett had to be replaced by a spare bowler who was already in the squad. In Hassett's absence, Australia's thin batting line-up collapsed on a damp pitch hostile to batsmen and lost. Returning for the Fourth Test at the MCG, Australia's batsmen again struggled; Hassett made 15 and his team conceded a lead of 56 on the first innings. His team was set a second innings target of 260 runs to win. Hassett made 102 but found little support from the other batsmen. When he was dismissed with the score at 8/218, the West Indies appeared set to level the series. However, an unbeaten last wicket partnership of 38 runs between tailenders Doug Ring and Bill Johnston gave Australia an unlikely victory and the series 3–1. It was reported that Hassett, who had just taken a shower after being dismissed, was so mesmerised by the efforts of Ring and Johnston that the watched the final moments of the match naked from the change rooms.\n\nAhead of the final Test of the series, Hassett's Victorians suffered a four-wicket defeat in their second match of the season against the West Indies, Hassett scoring 56 and 43. Australia completed an emphatic 4–1 result by winning the final encounter, even though they were bowled out for 116 on the first day of the match, before fighting back to dismiss the tourists for 78. Hassett's second innings score of 64 took his total to 402 runs (at an average of 57.43), making him the leading run-scorer for the series. Hassett ended the season with a dominant 229 against South Australia, setting up an innings win, dwarfing the 222 and 166 made by his opponents combined. Despite this, New South Wales claimed the Sheffield Shield for the season, and Hassett ended the summer with 855 runs at 61.07.\n\nIn 1952–53, South Africa's cricket authorities were hesitant to send their inexperienced team to Australia, fearing that the Test series would be uncompetitive. The Australian Board of Control's concern that—after losing money on the previous season's tour by the West Indies—the series would be another financial disaster resulted in South Africa offering an indemnity of £10,000 against any losses. Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests, although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa. He scored 123 in the return match later in the season and Victoria recorded two wins under his watch, against Queensland.\n\nAustralia won the opening game of the rubber in an unexpectedly close match in Brisbane by 96 runs, Hassett making 55 and 17. South Africa struck back and gained their first Test victory over Australia for 41 years, taking the Second Test at Melbourne by 82 runs. Australia recovered momentum by convincingly winning the Third Test by an innings, but Hassett's form had been mediocre in all three encounters, totalling 76 runs in five innings. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, he played his only significant innings for the series, scoring 163 and sharing a 275-run stand with Colin McDonald. With Australia heading for a victory that would give them the series, Ray Lindwall and Miller suffered injuries and were unable to bowl in the second innings. This compelled Hassett to delay his second innings declaration: South Africa then forced a draw by batting out 73 (eight-ball) overs against the depleted bowling attack with four wickets in hand. In anticipation of the forthcoming tour of England, Australian selectors made a fateful decision to rest Lindwall and Miller for the last Test when Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. He scored 40 runs in a total of 520 that gave Australia apparent command of the match. However, South Africa again fought back; after scoring 435, the tourists bowled Australia out for 209, Hassett making 30. They then won the match by chasing a target of 297 runs in their second innings. Hassett bowled the final over and the tourists’ Roy McLean took three fours from the first five balls to reach their target and square the series. Hassett ended the Tests with 309 runs at 38.63 and the entire season with 779 runs at 38.95, a substantially lower return compared to previous Australian summers.\n\nFor the first time in 20 years, Australia had failed to win a Test series at home, the last being the infamous Bodyline series of 1932–33. \"Wisden\" called the 2–2 result, \"... the biggest cricket shock for many years.\" The absence of Lindwall and Miller in the later part of the series exposed the limitations of the other Australian bowlers and did not augur well for the future. Hassett made it known that the tour of England in 1953 would be his farewell to the game. The selectors included only two specialist opening batsmen in the team, which caused problems when McDonald was injured and Morris struggled for form. This forced Hassett to play as an opener in the Tests; while Morris's old partner Barnes was in England to report on the tour as a reporter, his history of criticising cricket administrators meant that officialdom would call him into the squad to cover for McDonald. There were also tensions among the team off the field. The more experienced members of the team from Hassett's generation were World War II veterans, and were happy to be alive and tended to enjoy drinking and partying, while the younger members tended to be teetotallers. This led to a divide as the seniors regularly halted the team bus for drinking stops at the roadside pubs, leaving their younger teammates waiting. Some of the non-drinkers said that because of the frequent visits at pubs, the team bus only travelled approximately 15 km each hour.\n\nHassett struggled in two warm-up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, it was not to be a happy tour on the field. In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia's leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke down with a serious knee injury. Hassett struggled in the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.\n\nIn the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett hit 115 in a rain-affected match that ended in a draw. Over the next month, he struggled in the county matches, scoring only 30 runs in total. The Australians were to be frustrated in the next three Tests. In the Second Test at Lord's, Hassett made 104, top-scoring in Australia's 346 despite being hindered by a bandaged right arm and cramps. England took a 26-run first innings lead, but Australia replied with 368. Hassett's bowlers reduced England to 3/12 but they hung on to deny Australia victory. The Third Test was another wet affair. Hassett made 26 as Australia scored 318 and took a 42-run first innings lead, but they then collapsed to be 8/35. Australia was saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.\n\nIn the Fourth Test, the Australians worked themselves into a position to win the match and thus retain the Ashes. Hassett made 37 as his team compiled 266 and took a 99-run first innings lead. The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes at the start of the final day, but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours. This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match. Hassett made only four, but Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win. At that point, English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side in order to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball, but the umpires did not penalise them as wides. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 4/147 when time ran out. English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that \"they were right\" in claiming that Bailey's bowling was \"the worst kind of negative cricket\" and that he had \"cheated [them] of victory\". The match was also marred by a series of umpiring decisions made by Frank Chester against the Australians, leading Hassett to request that he not be appointed for the Fifth Test, something the English cricket authorities granted.\n\nThis meant that the fate of the Ashes would be determined by the final match at The Oval. Hassett warmed up with consecutive half-centuries against Surrey and Warwickshire. In the second innings of the latter match, he made 21 not out, holding the team together as Australia stumbled to 5/53 in pursuit of 166 for victory when time ran out.\n\nIn Australia's tour matches at The Oval, the pacemen had been effective, and Hassett and Morris thought that things would be similar in the Tests. As a result, leg spinner Ring was omitted. Hassett made 53 as Australia made 275 batting first. England then took a 31-run lead and Hassett was out for only 10 in the second innings as Australia fell for only 162, as the local spinners Jim Laker and Tony Lock cut down the Australians on a turning surface. The hosts then reached the target safely with eight wickets in hand to claim a 1–0 victory, thus winning the Ashes for the first time since the infamous Bodyline tour of 1932–33. Hassett was in fine form after the Tests, scoring 148 against Somerset, 65 against Kent, 106 against South, and 74 and 25 against TN Pearce's XI in the remaining first-class matches in England. Australia managed to win the matches against Kent and South by an innings, but it was too late to save the Ashes. Nevertheless, Harte said that \"Hassett’s leadership throughout had been sparkling\".\n\nHassett made one final first-class appearance upon returning to Australia, in a testimonial match against Morris's XI. He made 126 in the first innings, his final century, but could manage only three in the second as his team went down by 121 runs. Nevertheless, the match sent him into retirement £5,503 wealthier, and with more first-class centuries than any Australian except Bradman.\n\nThe diminutive Hassett was an elegant middle-order batsman, known for his wide range of strokes, timing, quick footwork and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes found it hard to discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and never took more than two in a single innings. He never took a wicket at Test level and bowled fewer than 19 overs.\n\nHassett's most distinctive trait was his fun-loving personality. He was famed for his practical jokes, sense of humour—particularly his self-deprecating quips—and wit, such as in his calming talk to the rioters in Calcutta in 1945. He remained jovial during his speeches even after Australia suffered defeats. After bowing out of Test cricket in 1953 with a loss, he said that England \"earned the victory from the very first ball—to the second last over anyway\", referring to an over that he bowled when defeat became inevitable.\n\nDuring the 1938 tour of England, Hassett smuggled a \"wet, muddy, and complaining\" mountain goat (put a waistcoat on the goat, according to some sources) into the bedroom he shared with Stan McCabe and O'Reilly while the team was staying at Grindleford, after they had fallen asleep. They awoke to unexpected smells and bleating. During the 1948 tour of England, he was reported to have unnerved his teammates and tempted fate by bringing a toy duck into the dressing room, and held up play during a county match by hiding the ball in a pile of sawdust. During the same summer, Hassett and a few teammates were being chauffeured back to London after a function. It was after midnight, but Hassett asked the driver to stop at a random mansion along the road. He then rang the bell and told the startled householder that he \"just thought we'd pop in\". The owner happened to recognise Hassett and received the cricketers. In the Third Test of the same tour, after dropping two hooked catches from Washbrook, Hassett responded by borrowing a policeman's helmet, before motioning to Ray Lindwall to bowl another bouncer. During the 1953 tour of England, a waiter spilled a dessert on Hassett's jacket. Initially declining the waiter's multiple offers to have his jacket taken away for cleaning, Hassett acquiesced and while taking off his jacket, noticed a spot on his trousers. He then silently pointed to the spot, removed his trousers and handed them to the waiter, before continuing to eat his meal in his underpants.\n\nAside from the humorous side of his personality, Hassett was also known for his diplomatic skills as a leader and his affability, particularly his ability to endear himself to hosts and public while representing Australia overseas. Richie Benaud wrote of Hassett: \"There are others who have made more runs and taken more wickets, but very few have ever got more out of a lifetime.\" Teammate Keith Miller said that Hassett had \"more genuine friends in all walks of life than any other cricketer\".\n\nAfter returning from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; one of his staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining in that position until 1981. During his time in the commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently made fun of his conservative approach to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.\n\nHe served on the executive committee of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, along with fellow former South Melbourne, Victorian and Test cricketer Laurie Nash. Hassett ran for election as South Melbourne's delegate to the VCA in December 1953, but was defeated. During the 1954–55 Ashes series in Australia, he wrote for \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nIn 1942, Hassett married Tessie Davis, a Geelong accountant, and they had two daughters. His nephew John Shaw went on to play for Victoria in the 1950s and 1960s. A batsman, Shaw was a regular member of the state team and was selected for an Australian Second XI that toured New Zealand in 1959–60. The MCG has a function room named after Hassett, as does the VCA, which launched a monthly luncheon club in December 1990 named in his honour. In the first year of its operation, more than 500 people joined and a profit in excess of AUD12,000 was made; this money was reinvested in the VCA's promotion of junior cricket.\n\nIn his final years, Hassett moved to Batehaven on the south coast of New South Wales to pursue his love of fishing. He died there in 1993.\n\n\n\n"}

He acquired a taste for music from his father Taniyappa , a Naadaswara vidwan. As a child, Gopalnath once saw the saxophone being played in the Mysore Palace band set. Upon hearing the vibrant tone of the saxophone, Gopalnath decided to master it. It took him nearly 20 years to conquer the complex western wind instrument, and he was eventually crowned as the \"Saxophone Chakravarthy\".\n\nGopalnath learnt to play Carnatic music on the saxophone from N. Gopalakrishna Iyer of Kalaniketan, Mangalore. He presented his first concert in the All India Radio, Mangaluru in 1978 . In Madras, Gopalnath came in contact with the vocalist and mridangist guru T.V. Gopalkrishnan, who identified the youngster's potential and tutored him.\n\nGopalnath had to make certain modifications to the conventional alto saxophone to play Carnatic music. So successful was this adaptation that the great musician Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, the doyen of Carnatic music, acknowledged Kadri Gopalnath as a true Carnatic music genius.\n\nHis maiden live performance was for the Chembai Memorial Trust. The 1980 Bombay Jazz Festival was a turning point for Gopalnath. John Handy, a jazz musician from California was present at the festival. Hearing Gopalnath play, Handy asked if he could go on stage and perform alongside him. So well did the two mesh, Handy in the jazz style and Gopalnath in the Carnatic style, that it became an instant hit with the audience. Gopalnath has participated in the Jazz Festival in Prague, the Berlin Jazz Festival, the International Cervantino Festival in Mexico, the Music Hall Festival in Paris, the BBC Promenade concert in 1994 at London, and has toured all over the world.\n\nHe cut many albums and recorded a number of cassettes and CDs. Together with jazz flautist James Newton, he recorded \"Southern Brothers\". His production called 'East-West' is an audio-video presentation that, as the title suggests, is a fusion of Western and Indian music. This album took 6 months to produce and has compositions from Saint Tyagaraja, Beethoven and the likes.\n\nFilm director K. Balachander used Gopalnath's services in his Tamil film \"Duet\". The film had music composed by A.R. Rahman and all the songs had saxophonic instrumentation by Gopalnath, mostly in raga Kalyanavasantam. He once said about this album: : \"I played some 30 ragas for Rahman. He wasn't satisfied. Finally I played Kalyanavasantam, and he said, \"Thats it!\". After that movie I became known. I was in all the papers. It became difficult to travel in buses and trains. Of course I enjoyed the mass appeal.\"\n\nIn 2005, Gopalnath began a collaboration with American saxophonist and composer Rudresh Mahanthappa, which resulted in the 2008 album \"Kinsmen\" (Pi Recordings) and supporting US tour.\n\nGopalnath died on 11 October 2019 due to cardiac arrest at the age of 69 at a private hospital in Mangalore.\n\nGopalnath was presented with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Carnatic Music - Instrumental (Saxophone), by the President Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam, in New Delhi on October 26, 2004.\n\nMany titles and honours had come his way, the most cherished being the Asthana Vidwan of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Sringeri Sharadha Peetam, Sri Ahobila Mutt and Sri Pillayarpatti Temple. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004.\n\nGopalnath had the distinction of being the first Carnatic musician to be invited in the BBC Promenade concert in 1994, in the Royal Albert Hall at London. The Asian Music Circuit, U.K, sponsored his recital.\n\nAmong his other distinctions are:\nSaxophone Charkravarthy, Saxophone Samrat, Ganakala Shree, Nadapasana Brahma, Sunada Prakashika, Nada Kalarathna, Nada Kalanidhi, Sangeetha Vadya Rathna, Karnataka Kalashree in 1996, Vocational Excellency Award from the Rotary of Madras, Tamil Nadu State Award \"Kalaimamani\" and Karnataka Rajyotsava Award in 1998.\n\nHe received an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University in 2004.\n\nThe 2008 album \"Blue Rhizome\" by the New Quartet features a tribute to the saxophonist called \"Gopalnath\" (composed by Karl E. H. Seigfried).\n\nHe received the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani award for the year 2013 given by The Indian Fine arts Society, Chennai.\n\nHe received the \"Kamban Pugazh\" award for the year 2018 given by All Ceylon Kamban Society, Sri Lanka.\n\n"}

He was married to Leonor Gomez-Montes (1880-?).\n\nLaredo Brú's rise to power began in January 1936 as Vice President. When Miguel Mariano Gómez, son of former president José Miguel Gómez, won the presidential election, strongman Fulgencio Batista engineered the impeachment of Gómez in December 1936 for having vetoed a bill to create rural schools under army control. Federico Laredo Brú served the concluding years of Gómez' term leading the way for an ambitious Batista.\n\nUnder Federico Laredo Brú, amnesties were granted including to the brutal, former dictator Gerardo Machado and the Cuban Congress passed many social welfare measures as well as laws creating pensions, insurance, minimum wages, and limited working hours.\n\nIn 1937 Laredo Brú pushed for the passage of the Law of Sugar Coordination which organized small farmers into cooperatives and unionized agricultural workers, guaranteed tenant farmers a share of their crop and that they were not to be deprived of their fields if they worked them.\n\nLaredo Brú also issued a decree that stated all businesses should be headed by Cuban nationals. Workers unionized, particularly into the Confederation of Cuban Workers, a union in which Communists had substantial influence.\n\nThough the United States had been a dominant force in Cuban politics since 1898 causing anti-American sentiment among the educated, the U.S. presence was lessened under Brú.\n\nOn May 27, 1939, the ocean liner MS St. Louis arrived, carrying 930 Jewish refugees from Hamburg, Germany fleeing Hitler's persecutions, and was refused permission to land by Laredo Brú. Cuban government-issued landing certificates held by the passengers had been invalidated by Laredo Brú's government during their transit. Two persons attempted suicide and dozens more threatened to do the same. Ultimately, only 20-odd refugees were permitted to disembark at Havana and the ship, having likewise failed to enter the U.S. and Canada, ultimately disembarked its remaining passengers in England, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nFormer president Laredo Bru died of a heart malady in Havana at the age of seventy-one.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866503", "title": "Johnny Rogan", "text": "Johnny Rogan\n\nJohnny Rogan is an author of Irish descent best known for his books about music and popular culture. He has written influential biographies of the Byrds, Neil Young, the Smiths, Van Morrison and Ray Davies. His writing is characterised by \"an almost neurotic attention to detail\", epic length (the first volume of \"Requiem for the Timeless\" is more than 1,200 pages long) and a curiously ambivalent, sometimes positive/sometimes hostile response from the subjects of his biographies.\n\nRogan's first publications were in the late 70s with writings on West Coast American music. Rogan spent his early childhood in the Pimlico area of London. His parents emigrated to London from Waterford (Ireland) in 1943. He is a cousin of the actor John Rogan. Rogan's adolescence during the 'Swinging 60s' was vividly captured in the chapter 'The Ghost of Electricity' from his book \"Timeless Flight Revisited\". There was no mention at all of his tragic family history which included his father (fatal heart attack, late 50s), brother (drowned), sister (fatal brain haemorrhage) and mother (emaciation), among other fatalities.\n\nRogan attended St Vincents, RC, and Pimlico School and spent the entire 70s as a student, obtaining his first degree in English Language & Literature at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, after which he completed an MA at Acadia University in Canada, specialising in Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\". This was followed by postgraduate study at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.\n\nHis first book \"Timeless Flight\", an acclaimed biography of The Byrds was published when he was still a student at Oxford's Lady Margaret Hall. This work was subsequently rewritten as the 700-page plus volume, \"Timeless Flight Revisited\". The work won considerable acclaim, including biography of the year in \"Record Collector\", in which it was described as \"One of the best biographies ever written...Expansive enough to rival \"War And Peace\", Johnny Rogan's definitive Byrds biography comes close to matching the emotional, if not geographical, range of Tolstoy's epic novel. One of the achievements of \"Timeless Flight Revisited\" is the way in which it matches its narrative flair with the incisiveness of its critical comment... But it's the narrative drive that makes the book so extraordinary. With its detailed research and fascinating interview material, \"Timeless Flight Revisited\" is a compelling portrait of collective turmoil, peopled by characters who win our sympathy at the same time as they earn our disbelief.\" Similar accolades were forthcoming from \"Billboard\", \"Time Out\" and \"Q Magazine\" (\"This is, at least, the best biography of a group ever written\"). Unusually, the book has been revised extensively in every decade since its original appearance.\n\nRogan went on to write more than 20 other books, mainly in the field of music and popular culture. These included epic biographies of Neil Young (Zero To Sixty) and Van Morrison, plus work on John Lennon, The Kinks, Wham!/George Michael (Virgin Yearbook \"Book of the Year\"), Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and The Smiths. Neil Young is quoted praising Rogan's work on the back of the biography along with a five-star review from \"Uncut\" and several other prominent music publications.\n\nThe best-selling \"Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance\" attracted considerable attention not least from Morrissey who famously said: \"Personally I hope Johnny Rogan ends his days very soon in an M3 pile-up.\" The comment was made prior to the book's publication and Morrissey claimed he had yet to see a copy of any of its contents. Not long afterwards Morrissey expressed a desire that the author should die in a hotel fire. However, in 1996 Morrissey testified under cross examination that he had not read the book, only \"bits of it\". He also testified that comparing some items of witness statements in relation to facts contained in the book that the 'book is correct'; he and Rogan also spoke about various matters at the High Court during a recess. \"The Severed Alliance\" has remained in print without interruption since first publication in 1992 and frequently appears in listings of all-time great music biographies. Rogan continues to write extensively about Morrissey, most recently with 2006's \"Morrissey: The Albums\".\n\nRogan has written two major biographies of Van Morrison and the acknowledgement page of \"VM: No Surrender\" states: \"This book has probably had the longest gestation of any I have written.\" (20 years). However, this is likely to be eclipsed by Rogan's continuing work on the careers of the Byrds and Neil Young. Morrison on his part is quoted on the 'Dedication Page', saying: \"Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him.\" However, this quote actually emanates from an interview in 1984. \"No Surrender\" featured in \"The Sunday Times\" Top 10 books of the year and also featured for two consecutive years in hardback and paperback in Mojo's music books of the year. Among the many favourable press notices attached to the paperback edition was an extravagant review concluding: \"\"Van Morrison: No Surrender\" is the best book about popular culture written about any Irishman living or dead, and it's certainly the best social history of Belfast in the mid-60s ever written.\"\n\nRogan has also written lengthy studies of football management and pop management (\"Starmakers & Svengalis\"), the latter of which was adapted for a BBC series. He has also contributed to numerous television documentaries, DVDs and anthologies, including \"Oxford Originals\" a collection of writings from authors, including Rogan, who studied at Lady Margaret Hall.\n\nRogan is known for his eccentricity. While working on a book, he once spent one year in isolation without speaking to another human-being.\n\nIn December 2011, \"Byrds: Requiem For The Timeless\" was published. \"Time Out\"'s lead review noted: \"Building on the brick-like \"Timeless Flight Revisited\", Rogan has now collated everything he knows and everything even the staunchest psych-rock aficionado will ever want to know about the group. Rogan's insight is, as ever, razor-keen, and the book is crammed with hilarious anecdotes and brilliant deconstructions of the music. \"Requiem For The Timeless\" may yet prove to be one of the key works of rock journalism – it's certainly set to be the definitive book on the Byrds.\" \n\nIn the summer of 2012, \"Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance – The 20th Anniversary Edition\", an expanded and rewritten version of the original was released.\n\nRogan’s 750-page biography \"Ray Davies: A Complicated Life\" was published in March 2015, with a revised paperback following one year later. According to the London Times: “Ray Davies is an eccentric, singular artist, but does anyone need to read more than 700 pages on him? Rogan, an obsessive, has form with this kind of thing. This makes for a lot to wade through but Rogan’s strength is in his dispassionate approach. He’s not in awe of Davies, nor does he have an axe to grind. Speaking to former wives and managers, band members, brother Dave and [Ray] Davies himself, he gives as definitive a view of the man as anyone could hope for.” \n\nIn August 2017, \"Byrds: Requiem For The Timeless, Volume 2\" was issued. Both Mojo and Record Collector awarded the book a maximum five stars, the former concluding: “Rogan’s dogged devotion, evocative descriptions and eternal quest for truth behind the myths shines from each of its 1,200 pages to create an essential companion to Volume 1.” \n\n\n\n"}

He emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of two. As a teenager, Groener was apprenticed at the San Francisco Ballet; he went on to study drama at the University of Washington.\n\nGroener's reputation in New York City rests almost entirely on his work in musical theater, although the bulk of his roles outside New York have been in classical drama or contemporary plays like \"Eastern Standard\". His Broadway credits include \"Is There Life After High School?\", Will Parker in \"Oklahoma!\" (Tony Award nomination, Theatre World Award), Munkustrap in \"Cats\" (Tony Award nomination), Georges/George in \"Sunday in the Park with George\", and Bobby Child in \"Crazy for You\" (Tony Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations).

{"id": "1866529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866529", "title": "Low-energy house", "text": "Low-energy house\n\nA low-energy house is characterized by an energy-efficient design and technical features which enable it to provide high living standards and comfort with low energy consumption and carbon emissions. Traditional heating and active cooling systems are absent, or their use is secondary. Low-energy buildings may be viewed as examples of sustainable architecture. Low-energy houses often have active and passive solar building design and components, which reduce the house's energy consumption and minimally impact the resident's lifestyle. Throughout the world, companies and non-profit organizations provide guidelines and issue certifications to guarantee the energy performance of buildings and their processes and materials. Certifications include passive house, BBC - Bâtiment Basse Consommation - Effinergie (France), zero-carbon house (UK), and Minergie (Switzerland).\n\nDuring the 1970s, experimental initiatives for low-energy buildings were made in Denmark, the United States, Sweden, Canada, and Germany. The German Passivhaus Institute introduced the first passive house in 1990. The implementation of standardized low-energy building concepts has developed differently in each country.\n\nBuildings alone are responsible for 38% of all human GHG emissions (20% residential, 18% commercial) as of 2008. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), buildings is the sector which presents the most cost effective opportunities for GHG reductions.\n\nInterest in low-energy buildings has increased in the United States, primarily due to rising energy prices, decreasing costs for onsite renewable-energy systems, and increasing concern about climate change. California requires all new residential construction to be zero net energy by 2020.\n\nTriggered in the 1970s by the first energy crisis and growing environmental awareness, energy conservation became increasingly important in Germany. In 1977, the country's first energy-related building standard was enacted. The annual heating requirement was introduced as an important parameter by the third German Thermal Insulation Ordinance (1995). In 2013, however, there was no clear legal requirement for a low-energy building standard in Germany. According to Maria Panagiotidou and Robert J. Fuller, definitions, policies and construction activity of zero-energy buildings must be clear. The European Union's Energy Performance Directive requires that beginning in 2021, only low-energy buildings may be built.\n\nChanges to national policies have occurred since May 2015 in the UK. One of the most significant has been the withdrawal of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CfSH) as a system for assessing and encouraging improvements in the environmental design of dwellings. This has abandoned the code's schematic which provided a framework of achievement levels and to which low-energy designers could aspire to meet or surpass. Although energy-conservation legislation still exists in the building regulations, there is a lack of suitable standards exceeding basic regulations. As a result, the Passive House Standard may expand its influence and impact on energy-efficient houses.\n\nThe term \"low-energy houses\" may refer to national building standards. These standards sometimes seek to limit the energy used for space heating, which is the largest energy consumer in many climate zones. Other energy uses may also be regulated. The history of passive solar building design provides an international view of one form of low-energy-building development and standards.\n\nStandards for low-energy buildings in Europe have proceeded differently in each country, and there is no common certification or legislation for low-energy buildings valid in all EU member states. As a movement towards reducing energy use and emissions, a common legislation concerning buildings’ energy performance, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was published in 2002 and became effective in January 2003.\n\nIn NS 3700, the draft official standard, low-energy buildings are defined. About the buildings' energy performance, two alternatives for rating their primary energy use are under discussion:\n\nLow-energy houses are defined in the National Building Regulation Building Regulations 08, and are divided into two classes. They are regulated in the regulations' chapter 7.2.4: Low-energy.\n\nLow-energy houses certified by RAL-GZ 965 have 30 percent less heat losses than regulated in the EnEV, a national building code. Other criteria affect insulation, air tightness and ventilation. Low-energy buildings may be certified by RAL-GZ 965 for planning or construction.\n\nLow-energy buildings may receive the Minergie certification, a \"quality label for new and refurbished buildings\". The Minergie standard requires that buildings do not exceed 75 percent of average building energy consumption and fossil-fuel consumption must not exceed 50 percent of the average.\n\nThe European Union directive has clarified low-energy houses in Europe, and a large portion of the discussions on zero-energy building in North America derives from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\n\nThe Energy Star program is the largest certifier of low-energy homes and consumer products in the U.S. Although certified Energy Star homes use at least 15 percent less energy than standard new homes built in accordance with the International Residential Code, they typically achieve a 20- to 30-percent savings. The United States Department of Energy introduced a program in 2008 to distribute zero-energy housing across thecountry.\n\nCanadian builders may use a range of standards, labels, and certification programs to demonstrate a high level of energy performance in a given project. These include:\n\nIn British Columbia the above programs align with the BC Energy Step Code, a provincial regulation to incentivize (or require) a level of energy efficiency in new construction beyond the base building code. The code was designed as a technical road map to help the province reach its target of all new net-zero-energy-ready buildings by 2032.\n\nLow-energy houses are broadly defined, but are generally known as houses with a lower energy demand than common buildings regulated by the national building code. The term \"low-energy house\" is used in some countries for a specific type of building.\n\nA low-energy house is a guideline rarely specified in actual values (heat load or space-heating minimum). A passive house is a standard, with specific recommendations to save heating energy.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum are buildings with an ultra-low space-heating requirement which require low levels of imported energy (even in winter), approaching an autonomous building. At the opposite end are buildings where few attempts are made to reduce their space-heating requirement and which use high levels of imported energy in winter. Although this may be balanced by high levels of renewable-energy generation throughout the year, it imposes greater demands on the national energy infrastructure during winter.\n\nEnergy-efficient design often relies on new technologies and techniques. These may create technical obstacles in addition to social, cultural, and economic non-technical obstacles. Despite these obstacles, opportunities exist for skilled, knowledgeable professions to create cost-efficient solutions for energy efficiency in buildings.\n\nBuildings designed for good energy efficiency do not always live up to the design goals; various reasons lead to this performance gap.\n\nLow-energy building design is considered important to encourage resource efficiency and reduce global climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Design involves two general strategies: minimizing the need for energy use in buildings (especially for heating and cooling) through energy-efficient measures (EEMs) and adopting renewable energy and other technologies (RETs) to meet remaining energy needs. EEMs include building envelopes, internal conditions, and building-services systems; RETs include photovoltaic or building-integrated photovoltaic, wind turbines, solar thermal (solar water heaters), heat pumps, and district heating and cooling. Impacts include life-cycle costs, environmental impacts, and climate-change and social-policy issues. The best low-energy designs offer occupants a better environment and more stable, controlled thermal comfort in addition to reduced energy costs.\n\nGHG emissions associated with buildings construction are mainly coming from:\n\n\nThe construction, renovation, and deconstruction of a typical building is on average responsible for the emissions of 1,000-1,500 kgCO2e/m2 (around 500 kgCO2e/m2 for construction only).\n\nStrategies adopted by low-carbon buildings to reduce GHG emissions during construction include:\n\n\nReduction of energy consumption is more environmentally and financially advantageous than increasing onsite production to reach a low-energy goal. The less a home consumes, the smaller renewable-energy system it requires to near net zero. Energy efficiency should always be the primary design strategy of a low-energy house.\n\n\n\nPassive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the low-energy house in conservation and can integrate it into a neighborhood and environment. Following passive solar building techniques, where buildings are compact in shape to reduce surface area and principal windows oriented towards the equator (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) maximizes passive solar gain. However, solar gain (especially in temperate climates) is secondary to minimizing the overall house-energy requirements. In hot temperatures, excess heat can create uncomfortable indoor conditions. Passive alternatives to air-conditioning systems, such as temperature-dependent venting, have been shown to be effective in regions with cooling needs. Other techniques to reduce excess solar heat include brise-soleils, trees, attached pergolas with vines, vertical gardens, and green roofs.\n\nAlthough low-energy houses can be constructed from dense or lightweight materials, internal thermal mass is normally incorporated to reduce summer peak temperatures, maintain stable winter temperatures, and prevent possible overheating in spring or autumn before the higher sun angle \"shades\" midday wall exposure and window penetration. Exterior wall color (when the surface allows choice) reflection or absorption depends on the predominant year-round outdoor temperature. The use of deciduous trees and wall trellised (or self-attaching) vines can assist in temperate climates.\n\nTo minimize total primary energy consumption, passive and active daylighting are the first daytime solutions to employ. For low-light days, non-daylight spaces and nighttime, sustainable lighting design with low-energy sources (such as standard-voltage compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state lighting with LED lamps, OLEDs and polymer light-emitting diodes and low-voltage incandescent light bulbs, compact metal halide, xenon and halogen lamps) can be used.\n\nSolar-powered exterior security and landscape lighting, with solar cells on each fixture or connecting to a central solar panel, are available for gardens and outdoor needs. Low-voltage systems can be used for more controlled (or independent) illumination, using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps. Timers, motion detection and daylighting operation sensors further reduce energy consumption and light pollution.\n\nHome appliances meeting independent energy-efficiency testing and receiving Ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical and natural-gas consumption and product-manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for low-energy houses. Energy Star and EKOenergy are other certification marks.\n\n\"Buildings\"\n\n\"Air and temperature\"\n\n\"Solar\"\n\n\"Energy rating standards\"\n\n\n\n"}

In the beginning, Steve Poltz and Robert Driscoll were acoustic duo playing in various coffeehouses and bars including the Blarney Stone Pub, the Mission Beach Club, Innerchange Coffee House, Megalopolis, and Java Joe's. They would sometimes be joined by Gerald \"Child\" McMullin making them a temporary acoustic power trio. The group released several self-produced \"cassette tapes\" in this band formation and were becoming a huge local draw and favorite in San Diego.\n\nAfter the group signed a contract with Bizarre/Planet Records in 1993 (a label associated with Herb Cohen, who had earlier managed Linda Ronstadt, Tom Waits and Frank Zappa). The duo wanted to add a rhythm section for a full, \"\"radio friendly\"\" sound. It was then, the duo permanently changed to a foursome with bassist singer/songwriter Gregory Page and drummer \"Stinky\". The quartet released their debut album \"Morning Wood\" which was produced by Buddy Blue (of The Beat Farmers), in early 1994.With funny, witty and sometimes bizarre lyrics, the band began to experience their first taste of national exposure; playing a sold out show at world-famous Cleveland Agora Theater and Ballroom.\n\nThe songs \"Hitchhiker Joe\" and \"Me and Eddie Vedder\" would go on to be the most recognizable tracks on the album. The song \"Hitchhiker Joe\" (written by Steve Poltz and Steve Foth of the San Diego Band C.L.A.) received a large amount of national airplay and held the No. 1 slot on the nightly \"Top 10\" for several weeks on San Diego station 91X in early 1994.\n\nThe video for \"Hitchhiker Joe\" was filmed at a local San Diego high school, and was directed by Michael Addis, who went on to direct several feature films. Poltz's girlfriend at the time was singer-songwriter Jewel, and she also appeared in the video.\n\n\"Me and Eddie Vedder\" is a strident introspection on the preposterous possibilities of overdosing in a hotel room alongside Eddie Vedder. The experience concludes with Vedder and Poltz overdosing while an 8-track player is blaring the \"Houses of the Holy\" album.\n\nIn early 1995, the band released an EP called \"Mommy I'm Sorry,\" which included the song \"Dick's Automotive,\" which is a favorite at The Rugburns shows. After \"Weird Al\" Yankovic saw one of the band's sold out performances at the Hollywood Troubadour, he met the band and soon after wrote a similar song, \"Albuquerque\".\n\nThe album also contains a cover of the theme song of the children's television series \"Sesame Street\".\n\nIn 1995, the band signed a deal with Priority Records. The Rugburns released their second full-length album in late 1995, \"Taking the World By Donkey,\" which again featured a generous helping of acoustic guitars spiked with edgy lyrics. The humor and cutting wit was still in the songwriting but there was an addition of a few darker themes. \"The Ballad of Tommy and Marla\" tells the sad tale of a couple that becomes hooked on crystal meth and eventually have their entire lives destroyed by their drug abuse, but in an endearing and fun manner.\n\nAfter the band's back to back touring of the entire United States, Gregory Page left the band to pursue a solo career and was replaced with John Castro. Soon after Page had departed, Driscoll left the band because of tour related health issues but recovered well and returned to teaching high school, his first profession. The band was to be known from then on as a trio: Steve Poltz, John Castro and \"Stinky\". The Rugburns were now achieving their biggest national fame. The national fame was in part because of radio play and the constant touring year to year. A serious boost came when the Jewel Kilcher fans, known as Everyday Angels began to follow the group and post about them on the Everyday Angels internet chat group. For several years, Steve Poltz and Jewel had been together romantically. Poltz \"co-wrote\" her biggest hit, \"You Were Meant for Me\" and also appeared the video for the song. On Jewel's \"Tiny Lights\" tour, the Rugburns were the opening act and her backing band.\n\nIt was at this time that Poltz was trying to create a solo career alongside the Rugburns. Poltz then released two solo albums on the Mercury label: \"One Left Shoe\"(1997) and \"Conversations Over a Cerveza\"(1998)\n\nThen after being dropped from Mercury, Poltz self-released several other albums: \n\"Answering Machine\"(1999), \"Live at Largo\"(2000), \"Live at the Basement\" DVD(2003), \"Chinese Vacation\" (2003), \"The Barn\"(2007), \"Tales from the Tavern\" CD/DVD(2007), \"Unraveling\"(2008), \"Traveling\"(2008) and \"Dreamhouse\"(2010)\n\nSteve Poltz, Rob Driscoll, Stinky, Gregory Page and John Castro\nstill perform as The Rugburns.\n\n\n\nThe Rugburns\nSteve Poltz - Solo\nSteve Poltz - Solo • Independently Released titles\n\nSteve Poltz - Solo\n\n"}

This article covers those filters consisting of lumped electronic components, as opposed to distributed-element filters. That is, using components and interconnections that, in analysis, can be considered to exist at a single point. These components can be in discrete packages or part of an integrated circuit.\n\nElectronic filters remove unwanted frequency components from the applied signal, enhance wanted ones, or both. They can be:\n\n\nThe most common types of electronic filters are linear filters, regardless of other aspects of their design. See the article on linear filters for details on their design and analysis.\n\nThe oldest forms of electronic filters are passive analog linear filters, constructed using only resistors and capacitors or resistors and inductors. These are known as RC and RL single-pole filters respectively. However, these simple filters have very limited uses. Multipole LC filters provide greater control of response form, bandwidth and transition bands. The first of these filters was the constant k filter, invented by George Campbell in 1910. Campbell's filter was a ladder network based on transmission line theory. Together with improved filters by Otto Zobel and others, these filters are known as image parameter filters. A major step forward was taken by Wilhelm Cauer who founded the field of network synthesis around the time of World War II. Cauer's theory allowed filters to be constructed that precisely followed some prescribed frequency function.\n\nPassive implementations of linear filters are based on combinations of resistors (R), inductors (L) and capacitors (C). These types are collectively known as \"passive filters\", because they do not depend upon an external power supply and/or they do not contain active components such as transistors.\n\nInductors block high-frequency signals and conduct low-frequency signals, while capacitors do the reverse. A filter in which the signal passes through an inductor, or in which a capacitor provides a path to ground, presents less attenuation to low-frequency signals than high-frequency signals and is therefore a \"low-pass filter\". If the signal passes through a capacitor, or has a path to ground through an inductor, then the filter presents less attenuation to high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals and therefore is a \"high-pass filter\". Resistors on their own have no frequency-selective properties, but are added to inductors and capacitors to determine the \"time-constants\" of the circuit, and therefore the frequencies to which it responds.\n\nThe inductors and capacitors are the reactive elements of the filter. The number of elements determines the order of the filter. In this context, an LC tuned circuit being used in a band-pass or band-stop filter is considered a single element even though it consists of two components.\n\nAt high frequencies (above about 100 megahertz), sometimes the inductors consist of single loops or strips of sheet metal, and the capacitors consist of adjacent strips of metal. These inductive or capacitive pieces of metal are called stubs.\n\nThe simplest passive filters, RC and RL filters, include only one reactive element, except hybrid LC filter which is characterized by inductance and capacitance integrated in one element.\n\nAn L filter consists of two reactive elements, one in series and one in parallel.\n\nThree-element filters can have a 'T' or 'π' topology and in either geometries, a low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop characteristic is possible. The components can be chosen symmetric or not, depending on the required frequency characteristics. The high-pass T filter in the illustration, has a very low impedance at high frequencies, and a very high impedance at low frequencies. That means that it can be inserted in a transmission line, resulting in the high frequencies being passed and low frequencies being reflected. Likewise, for the illustrated low-pass π filter, the circuit can be connected to a transmission line, transmitting low frequencies and reflecting high frequencies. Using m-derived filter sections with correct termination impedances, the input impedance can be reasonably constant in the pass band.\n\nMultiple-element filters are usually constructed as a ladder network. These can be seen as a continuation of the L,T and π designs of filters. More elements are needed when it is desired to improve some parameter of the filter such as stop-band rejection or slope of transition from pass-band to stop-band.\n\nActive filters are implemented using a combination of passive and active (amplifying) components, and require an outside power source. Operational amplifiers are frequently used in active filter designs. These can have high Q factor, and can achieve resonance without the use of inductors. However, their upper frequency limit is limited by the bandwidth of the amplifiers.\n\nThere are many filter technologies other than lumped component electronics. These include digital filters, crystal filters, mechanical filters, surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, garnet filters, and atomic filters (used in atomic clocks).\n\nThe transfer function formula_1 of a filter is the ratio of the output signal formula_2 to that of the input signal formula_3 as a function of the complex frequency formula_4:\n\nThe transfer function of all linear time-invariant filters, when constructed of lumped components (as opposed to distributed components such as transmission lines), will be the ratio of two polynomials in formula_4, i.e. a rational function of formula_7. The order of the transfer function will be the highest power of formula_7 encountered in either the numerator or the denominator.\n\nElectronic filters can be classified by the technology used to implement them.\nFilters using passive filter and active filter technology can be further classified by the particular electronic filter topology used to implement them.\n\nAny given filter transfer function may be implemented in any electronic filter topology.\n\nSome common circuit topologies are:\n\n\nHistorically, linear analog filter design has evolved through three major approaches. The oldest designs are simple circuits where the main design criterion was the Q factor of the circuit. This reflected the radio receiver application of filtering as Q was a measure of the frequency selectivity of a tuning circuit. From the 1920s filters began to be designed from the image point of view, mostly being driven by the requirements of telecommunications. After World War II the dominant methodology was network synthesis. The higher mathematics used originally required extensive tables of polynomial coefficient values to be published but modern computer resources have made that unnecessary.\n\nLow order filters can be designed by directly applying basic circuit laws such as Kirchhoff's laws to obtain the transfer function. This kind of analysis is usually only carried out for simple filters of 1st or 2nd order.\n\nThis approach analyses the filter sections from the point of view of the filter being in an infinite chain of identical sections. It has the advantages of simplicity of approach and the ability to easily extend to higher orders. It has the disadvantage that accuracy of predicted responses relies on filter terminations in the image impedance, which is usually not the case.\n\nThe network synthesis approach starts with a required transfer function and then expresses that as a polynomial equation of the input impedance of the filter. The actual element values of the filter are obtained by continued-fraction or partial-fraction expansions of this polynomial. Unlike the image method, there is no need for impedance matching networks at the terminations as the effects of the terminating resistors are included in the analysis from the start.\n\nHere is an image comparing Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic filters. The filters in this illustration are all fifth-order low-pass filters. The particular implementation – analog or digital, passive or active – makes no difference; their output would be the same.\n\nAs is clear from the image, elliptic filters are sharper than all the others, but they show ripples on the whole bandwidth.\n"}

It is played under the supervision of Hockey Canada and the Canadian Junior Hockey League.\n\nThe championship has also been known as the National Junior A Championship in 2019, it was formerly known as the Royal Bank Cup from 1996 to 2018 and the Manitoba Centennial Cup from 1971 to 1995.\n\n\nThe Manitoba Centennial Trophy was presented to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) by the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association to commemorate their centennial year of 1970. At that time, the CAHA reconfigured their junior tiers, creating two separate classifications – Major junior and Junior A. The major junior teams were grouped into the three regional leagues that made up the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL), while the Junior A tier included the remaining junior teams in the provincial/regional leagues that later formed the Canadian Junior Hockey League. It was determined that the Memorial Cup, which had served as the CAHA's national championship tournament, would become the new championship trophy for the CMJHL while the Manitoba Centennial Trophy served as the trophy for the champions of the new Junior A division. The tournament was then dubbed the Centennial Cup. For the 1996 tournament, the trophy gained a sponsor and became the Royal Bank Cup.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1984, the Centennial Cup pitted the Abbott Cup champion (Western Canada) versus the Dudley Hewitt Cup champion (Eastern Canada). A three-team tournament format, splitting Eastern Canada into two regions, was introduced in 1979 and used until 1981. The Centennial Cup permanently moved back to the tournament format in 1986, with the addition of a predetermined host team to the field. It later expanded to a five-team tournament in 1990 when the Abbott Cup series was discontinued in favour of allowing both the ANAVET and Doyle Cup winners to advance to the national championship. The ANAVET and Doyle Cups were temporarily replaced by the Western Canada Cup, which determined the two Western seeds for the Royal Bank Cup, from 2013 to 2017. During this time, the Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League won the 2014 Royal Bank Cup, where they had gained entry into the tournament as the Western Canada Cup runner-up making them the first team in Centennial Cup/Royal Bank Cup history to win the national championship without being the host or a regional champion.\n\nOvertime is common as the Junior A championships with the longest game in the tournament's history started on May 12, 2007, at 2007 Royal Bank Cup between the Camrose Kodiaks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League and the host Prince George Spruce Kings of the British Columbia Hockey League. The Spruce Kings won the game 3–2 6:01 into the fifth overtime period. The game lasted 146:01, just short of the CJAHL record set by the Toronto Jr. Canadiens and the Pickering Panthers in the 2007 Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League playoffs (154:32).\n\nAfter the 2018 Royal Bank Cup, Royal Bank of Canada ended their sponsorship agreement with the Canadian Junior Hockey League. After going by the name National Junior A Championship in 2019, the CJHL and Hockey Canada reverted the title back to its original name — the Centennial Cup — for its 50th anniversary in 2020. In December 2019, Tim Hortons was unveiled by Hockey Canada as the presenting sponsor for the Centennial Cup. The 2020 tournament was later cancelled in response to the coronavius pandemic, the first time the championship has not been played since 1970. \n\nSince 1990, tournament structure has used a five-team round-robin followed by a playoff. The current format for qualification of the participating teams are the four regional champions and the host team.\n\nThe Red Deer Rustlers of the Alberta Junior Hockey League defeated the Charlottetown Islanders of the Island Junior Hockey League in 1971 to claim the inaugural Canadian Junior A championship and Manitoba Centennial Trophy.\n\nThe 1972 Centennial Cup gained national attention when the Guelph CMC's of the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League were in the final game of a four-game sweep of the Red Deer Rustlers and their leading scorer Paul Fendley lost his helmet during a body check and struck his head on the ice, knocking him into a coma. The National Hockey League prospect regained consciousness and died two days later from head trauma.\n\nThe 1990 Centennial Cup marked the only year that the national championship was decided between two teams from the same province or league. The host Vernon Lakers defeated the New Westminster Royals 6–5 in overtime to win the national championship. Both teams were members of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League.\n\nThe final Centennial Cup from this era was awarded to the Calgary Canucks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League in 1995.\n\n\"Note: Champions in bold.\"\nEvery tournament in the Royal Bank Cup era was played as a round-robin tournament between five teams. In May 1996, the inaugural Royal Bank Cup was held in Melfort, Saskatchewan. The first winner of the Royal Bank Cup was the Vernon Vipers of the British Columbia Hockey League.\n\nIn 2018, the championship was renamed the National Junior A Championship after the Royal Bank of Canada dropped their sponsorship of the event.\n\nWith the national championship scheduled to return to Manitoba for its 50th anniversary in 2020, Hockey Canada and the Canadian Junior Hockey League announced that the championship return to its original name, the Centennial Cup.\n\nWinners of the Centennial Cup (1971–1995), Royal Bank Cup (1996–2018), and National Junior A Championship (2019) by province.\n\nThe Pembroke Lumber Kings won the 2011 Royal Bank Cup, and became the first Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL) team to win the National Junior A Championship since the 1976 champion Rockland Nationals. In 2015, the Portage Terriers broke a 41-year-old drought for the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, being the first team win the Junior A championship since the 1974 Selkirk Steelers. The Maritimes provinces have only won two championships. To date, no teams from the Quebec Junior Hockey League, Superior International Junior Hockey League, or the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League have won the Junior A championship.\n\nWinners of the Centennial Cup (1971–1995), Royal Bank Cup (1996–2018) and National Junior A Championship (2019–present) by team.\n\nThere has been a consecutive national champion on three occasions: the Prince Albert Raiders won in 1981 and 1982, while the Vernon Lakers/Vipers won in 1990 and 1991 (as the Lakers), and again in 2009 and 2010 (as the Vipers).\n\nThe Prince Albert Raiders also hold a record for appearing in the championship final three consecutive times, in 1977, 1978 and 1979. The Raiders also reached the national finals five times in six years (1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982), while winning a total of four championships (1977, 1979, 1981, 1982) during that span. The Raiders moved up to Major Junior Western Hockey League after their 1982 Junior A championship, where they soon won the Memorial Cup for the major junior national championship in 1985.\n\nThe Roland Mercier Trophy is awarded to the Most Valuable Player of the National Junior A Championship.\n\n\n\"Records included in this section took place in either Royal Bank Cup and Manitoba Centennial Cup tournament games and Manitoba Centennial Cup National Final Series games only.\"\n\n"}

He was known as \"Shahenshah-e-Jazbaat\" \n(), meaning \"The Emperor of Emotions\". A highly versatile actor, he performed in historical, biographical and patriotic roles; in costume and art movies. He has starred in over 250 movies playing both heroes and villains. He is among the 25 greatest actors of Asia (all time) according to a CNN survey (On 4 March 2010).\n\nMohammad Ali was born in Rampur, British India on 19 April 1931. He was the son of Maulana Syed Murshid Ali, who was an Islamic scholar. Born into a religious family, he was the youngest of two brothers and two sisters. After his birth the family migrated from Rampur to Rohtak, and from there to Hyderabad, finally settling in Multan shortly after the independence of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nHe attended the Millat High School, Multan. He was a favorite student of Mirza Musart Baig and Syed Naseer Ahmed. He was a close friend of Syed Iqbal Shah and Khalid Mahmood Bukhari, and did his intermediate examination (12th grade) from Government Emerson College, Multan. In 1954, he moved to Hyderabad to pursue higher studies and obtained a BA from City College, Hyderabad.\n\nMuhammad Ali joined Radio Pakistan Hyderabad station as a broadcaster in 1956, where his elder brother Irshad was already working as a drama artist. After some time working there, he moved to Bhawalpur station and from there finally moved to Radio Pakistan, Karachi.\n\nMohammad Ali started his film career with Fazal Ahmad Karim Fazli's film \"Chiragh Jalta Raha (1962)\".\n\"Chiragh Jalta Raha\" was premiered by Fatima Jinnah on 9 March 1962 at Nishat Cinema, Karachi. He then appeared as a villain in director Munawwar Rasheed's film \"Bahadur\", director Iqbal Yusuf's film \"Daal Mein Kala\", and director Javed Hashmi's film \"Dil Ne Tujhay Maan Liya\". His first film as a hero was \"Mr. X\" but Movie \"Shararat (1963)\" was released earlier than film \"Mr. X\". Later, he moved to Lahore and worked in the movie \"Khandan\" (1964). But his breakthrough was from the film \"Khamosh Raho\" (1964). In 1989, he had an extended cameo in the Hindi film \"Clerk\".\n\nMohammad Ali was the lead actor and 'hero' in 94 films. His first lead actor movie was \"Shararat (1963)\" and his last movie as a lead actor was \"Aaj Ki Raat\" (1983). Another movie was \"Mohabbat ho to aisi\" (1989) and his last movie of his career was titled \"Dum Mast Qalander\" (1995).\n\nAli was most often voiced by Mehdi Hassan and Ahmed Rushdi. Mehdi Hassan sang 115 songs for Ali in his 88 movies. Rushdi sang 100 songs in 57 movies for Ali. Masood Rana sang 34 songs for Ali in his 23 films. Others who provided his voice were Akhlaq Ahmed, Ghulam Abbas, Rajab Ali and Mujeeb Aalam.\n\nAli met Zeba the first time in 1962 during the filming of their debut film \"Chirag Jalta Raha (1962)\". The couple got married four years later during the filming of \"Tum mile pyar mila\" on 29 September 1966 and remained married until Ali's death in 2006.\n\nThey did not have any children together. However, Mohammad Ali legally adopted Samina, Zeba's daughter from her previous marriage, giving her the name Samina Ali.\n\nMohammad Ali and his wife Zeba both had close relations with different political regimes in the country. He protested by putting up black dress in International Moscow Film Festival against India for holding 93,000 POWs after the 1971 war.

{"id": "1866552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866552", "title": "Theatre Owners Booking Association", "text": "Theatre Owners Booking Association\n\nTheatre Owners Booking Association, or T.O.B.A., was the vaudeville circuit for African American performers in the 1920s. The theaters mostly had white owners (the recently restored Morton Theater in Athens, Georgia, originally operated by \"Pinky\" Monroe Morton, being a notable exception) and booked jazz and blues musicians and singers, comedians, and other performers, including the classically trained, such as operatic soprano Sissieretta Jones, known as \"The Black Patti\", for black audiences.\n\nThe association was established following the work of vaudeville performer Sherman H. Dudley. By 1909, Dudley was widely known as the \"Lone Star Comedian\" and had begun an attempt to have a black-owned and operated string of venues around the United States. By 1911 Dudley was based in Washington, D.C. as general manager and treasurer of the Colored Actors' Union, and set up S. H. Dudley Theatrical Enterprises, which began buying and leasing theaters around Washington and Virginia. By 1916 the \"Dudley Circuit\" had extended into the south and Midwest, enabling black entertainers to secure longer-term contracts for an extended season; this circuit provided the basis for T.O.B.A. His circuit was advertised in a weekly column published in black newspapers, \"What's What on the Dudley's Circuit\", and by 1914 it included over twenty theaters, \"all owned or operated by blacks and as far south as Atlanta.\"\n\nT.O.B.A. was formally established in 1920 by people associated with Dudley's circuit. Its President was Milton Starr, owner of the Bijou Theater in Nashville; its chief booker was Sam Reevin of Chattanooga. The organization had more than 100 theaters at its peak in the early to mid 1920s. Often referred to by the black performers as Tough on Black Artists (or, by Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey, as Tough on Black Asses), the association was generally known as Toby Time (\"Time\" was a common term for vaudeville circuits). It booked only black artists into a series of theatres on the East Coast and as far west as Oklahoma. T.O.B.A. venues were the only ones south of the Mason-Dixon line that regularly sought black audiences, according to one reference. T.O.B.A. paid less and generally had worse touring arrangements, which the performers had to pay for themselves, than the white vaudeville counterpart. But like white vaudeville, T.O.B.A. faded from popularity during the Great Depression, collapsing in late 1930 when Dudley sold his chain of theaters to a cinema company.\n\nAccording to writer Preston Lauterbach, \"a basic TOBA troupe carried about all the variety a single stage could hold, not to mention all the personalities one sleeping car could hold\", including tap dancers, comedy teams, actors, and blues singers. Their backdrops, costumes and props moved with them. Its earliest star performers included singers Ethel Waters, Gertrude Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Edmonia Henderson, Mamie Smith, Minto Cato and Adelaide Hall; comedian Tim Moore with his Chicago Follies company (which included his wife Gertie); the Whitman Sisters and their Company; musicians Fletcher Henderson, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, Joe \"King\" Oliver, and Duke Ellington; comedians Sandy Burns, Salem Whitney Tutt, Boots Hope, Seymour James, and Tom Fletcher; future Paris sensation Josephine Baker; songwriter and pianist Perry Bradford, the mime Johnny Hudgins; dancers U. S. Thompson, Walter Batie, Earl \"Snakehips\" Tucker, and Valaida Snow; and many others. In addition, later well-known names such as Florence Mills, Lincoln \"Stepin Fetchit\" Perry, Hattie McDaniel, Mantan Moreland, Jackie \"Moms\" Mabley, Dewey Pigmeat Markham, Johnny Lee, Marshall \"Garbage\" Rogers, Amanda Randolph, Chick Webb, Cab Calloway, a young William Basie (before he came to be called \"Count\") on tour with Gonzelle White, and four-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. all performed on the T.O.B.A. circuit. The death of White's husband was blamed on poor conditions at the theaters.\n\nThe most prestigious black theaters in Harlem, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., were not part of the circuit, booking acts independently; The T.O.B.A. was considered less prestigious. Many black performers, such as Bert Williams, George Walker, Johnson and Dean, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Tim Moore, and Johnny Hudgins also performed in white vaudeville, often in Blackface.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866561", "title": "Energy-plus-house", "text": "Energy-plus-house\n\nAn energy-plus house (also called: plus-energy house, efficiency-plus house) produces more energy from renewable energy sources, over the course of a year, than it imports from external sources. This is achieved using a combination of microgeneration technology and low-energy building techniques, such as: passive solar building design, insulation and careful site selection and placement. A reduction of modern conveniences can also contribute to energy savings, however many energy-plus houses are almost indistinguishable from a traditional home, preferring instead to use highly energy-efficient appliances, fixtures, etc., throughout the house.\n\nPlusEnergy is a term used in building design to describe a structure that produces more energy than it uses. The term was coined in 1994 by Rolf Disch when building his private residence, the Heliotrope as the first PlusEnergy house in the world. Disch then went on to refine the concepts involved with several more projects built by his company Rolf Disch Solar Architecture in order to promote PlusEnergy for wider adoption in residential, commercial and retail spaces. Disch maintains that PlusEnergy is more than just a method of producing environmentally-friendly housing, but also an integrated ecological and architectural concept. As such, PlusEnergy is intended to be superior to low-energy or zero-energy designs such as those of Passivhaus. \n\nThe PlusEnergy approach uses a variety of techniques to produce a building that generates more energy than it consumes. A typical example is to capture heat during the day in order to reduce the need to generate heat over night. This is achieved using large North and South facing window areas to allow sunlight to penetrate the structure, reducing the need for energy use from light bulbs. Triple-paned windows (U-value = 0.7) trap this heat inside, and the addition of heavy insulation then means the structure is already warm in the evening and therefore needs less heating. In the Sun Ship, a commercial, retail and residential PlusEnergy structure, techniques such as phase changing materials in the walls and vacuum insulation are also used. This permits maximum availability of floor space without compromising efficient insulation.\n\nAn important part of the PlusEnergy approach that differentiates it from similar concepts is that the owner or tenant of a PlusEnergy building should be able to live and work comfortably in it without sacrificing lifestyle or normal living standards. For example, solar panels are made aesthetically pleasing so that they are integrated into the façade of the structure. This reflects PlusEnergy's emphasis on community planning and integration, with aspects of transportation, water management and communication also being seen as part of the design. \n\nPlusEnergy design also emphasises the importance of sustainable development on communities in general. An energy-efficient community is seen as generating positive identification and community pride. Rolf Disch says he attracts a high quality of tenant, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his designs. Ecological urban planning techniques like traffic management with wide, attractive walkways, bicycle routes and connections to public transportation are all part of the PlusEnergy ideal. At the Solar Settlement for example, tenants and owners incorporate bicycle and car-sharing, and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections.\n\nBuilt in 1994 as the private residence and special project of Rolf Disch in Freiburg, the Heliotrope is claimed by its designer to be the first building in the world to create more energy than it uses, being reliant on entirely renewable power, and being emissions free and CO neutral. The structure rotates to track the sun, which allows it to use a large amount of natural sunlight and warmth during the day. Several different energy generation technologies are used in the building, including a dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel, a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar-thermal balcony railing to provide heat and warm water. These in combination with the large amounts of insulation allow the Heliotrope to produce between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year. The building is also fitted with a grey-water cleansing system and built-in waste composting.\n\nAfter the success of Freiburg’s Heliotrope, Hansgrohe contracted Rolf Disch Solar Architecture to design and built another Heliotrope to be used as a visitors' center and showroom in Offenburg, Germany. A third Heliotrope was then built in Hilpoltstein, Bavaria to be used as a technical dental laboratory. \n\nWith the success of the Heliotrope, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture applied their PlusEnergy concept to mass residential production in the form of a community development of 50 PlusEnergy houses. The project, called Solar Settlement, won 2002 House of the Year, 2002 Residential PV Solar Integration Award, and Germany’s Most Beautiful Housing Community, 2006. Built between 2000 and 2005 in the Vauban quarter of Freiburg, the Solar Settlement is intended as an example of Disch’s vision of a “fundamental environmental imperative”. As of 2011, the homes have had more than 8 years of full occupancy and each produced more than 5,000 Euros ($5,600) of surplus energy a year, from which the owners of the houses have benefitted.\n\nMade from Black Forest timber, the wood interior and natural lighting provide for happily lit spaces and a natural flow from room to room. The tenants at the Solar Settlement claim not to have made any compromises in their living standards, and that they have benefitted environmentally and economically.\n\nThe Sun Ship, located next to the Solar Settlement in Freiburg, uses its for retail, commercial and residential space. The Sun Ship houses a supermarket, convenience store and café on the first floor, offices and work spaces on the 2nd and 4th floors, and 9 penthouses on its roof. Notable aspects of the building are its vacuum insulated walls, ventilation with 95% heat recovery, triple paned windows, and solar-panelled façade.\n\nAs the first positive energy office building worldwide, the Sun Ship exhibits not only high energy efficiency but also a pleasant environment to work in. The office spaces are flanked on both the North and South ends entirely with windows, which captures natural sunlight and minimizes the energy wasted by artificial light. In addition to the office and retail space, two conference rooms provide space for lectures, meetings and as a showroom.\n\n\n\n"}

The FAM subsystem allows applications to \"watch\" certain files and be notified when they are modified.

It started in northern Bordeaux in southwest France at 2am and finished in the capital Paris 14 hours later. The professional event was held from 1891 until 1988. It was held as an amateur event in 2014.\n\nThe event was first run on 23 May 1891, and the Derby of the Road as it was sometimes called, was notable in that riders were paced – allowed to slipstream – behind tandem or conventional cycles. From 1931, pacing was by motorcycles or small pedal-assisted Dernys. Pacing was also briefly by cars. In early events, pacing was provided from Bordeaux. In later events, it was introduced part-way towards Paris. From 1946 to 1985, more than half the distance was paced, Dernys being introduced at Poitiers or Châtellerault, roughly half-way.\n\nThe organisers of the inaugural event, Bordeaux Vélo Club and \"Véloce Sport\" envisaged that riders might take a few days, but the first edition was won in a continuous ride by George Pilkington Mills. Mills raced through the night to win the 600 km long event in just over a day. Post-war winners include Louison Bobet (1959), Tom Simpson (1963), and Jacques Anquetil (1965). The record for the most victories is held by Herman Van Springel, who won seven times between 1970 and 1981.\n\nGeorge Mills won the inaugural Bordeaux–Paris race in 1891. He was invited by the organisers, the newspaper \"Véloce Sport\" because of his reputation in an age when long-distance racing was the fashion. A race from Bordeaux in the south-west to the capital in Paris would be the longest annual event in France.\n\nThe race started at 5am in the Place du Pont Bastide in Bordeaux. There were 38 riders. As well as the British – Pilkington Mills, Holbein, Edge and Bates – there were a Pole and a Swiss. Mills fell on bad roads after 10 km when he touched with the Frenchman, Jiel-Laval, but neither was hurt. The English group moved to the front when the field began to straggle after the first hour. They led by a mile at dawn after averaging 14 mph. The historian Victor M. Head wrote: \"At 10.30 Angoulème was reached and the Englishmen stopped to gulp down bowls of hot soup. When they restarted, Mills began to make all the running, drawing steadily away from his companions until, arriving at Ruffec, Charente, he was half an hour in the lead.\"\n\nThe rapid departure surprised the organisers. A report said:\n\nMills reached Tours after 215 miles and more than 12 hours on the road. He rested for five minutes, ate raw meat \"and a specially prepared stimulant\", and set off an hour ahead of the other British riders. \"By now,\" said Head, \"the Frenchmen were hopelessly out of the running.\" He wrote:\n\nAlthough the judges, the officials, and the large crowd had been waiting impatiently for three hours before the winner's weary, mud-caked figure was seen coming along the boulevard de la Porte Maillot, his reception was \"wildly enthusiastic\", as one writer put it , and he was escorted in triumph to his hotel. The time of 26h 36m 25s was truly remarkable when one considers the appalling road conditions, poor weather, and the delays, and all the other hardships encountered . The British victory was complete as Montague Holbein (27h 52m 15s) came in second, with Edge, nearly three hours away, third, and Bates fourth.\n\nThe Bicycle Union – later renamed the National Cyclists Union – had strict views about amateurism and had demanded its French equivalent ensure that all taking part met its own amateur ideals. Only then would the NCU allow Mills and other British amateurs to take part. \nWhen Mills won, the Bicycle Union realised he was the works manager at a bicycle factory and decided he should be asked \"whether he paid the whole of his expenses in the above-mentioned race.\" Only when he could prove that he had did the Bicycle Union concede that he was not a professional.\n\nSource:\nBordeaux–Paris began to lose prestige in the 1980s. It required special training and clashed with riders' plans to compete in the Vuelta a España or Giro d'Italia stage races. Fields began to dwindle and the last motor-paced version was 1985; three non-paced versions were held from 1986 but 1988 proved the last as a professional race.\n\n"}

Queen Juliana of the Netherlands (1909-2004), former Queen of the Netherlands (1948-1980), was an agnatic member of this house.\n\nThe family was established by Pribislav, an Obotrite (Slavic) prince who converted to Christianity and accepted the suzerainty of Saxon Duke Henry the Lion (r. 1142–1180), his fallen father's enemy, and became the Lord of Mecklenburg (derived from \"Mikla Burg\", \"big fortress\", their main fortress). The Obotrites were subsequently Germanized. The main branch of the house was elevated in 1347 to ducal rank.\n\nEach field in the coat of arm symbolizes one of the seven high lordly dominions of the state of Mecklenburg: upper-left quarter: Duchy of Mecklenburg, upper-right quarter: Lordship of Rostock, middle-left quarter divided in two: Principality of Schwerin, middle inescutcheon: County of Schwerin, middle-right quarter: Principality of Ratzeburg, lower-left quarter: Lordship of Stargard, and lower-right quarter: Principality of Wenden.\n\nThe Dukes of Mecklenburg pursued from the 14th century a claim to inheritance in Sweden. The Duke of Mecklenburg was a descendant and the heir of two women whom legends tied to Scandinavian royal houses:\n\nThe Sverker dynasty had long been extinct, having lost the throne ultimately to Eric XI. The male dynasty of Eric X was already extinct, and issue of his other daughters had been sidestepped by Birger Jarl, the husband of his daughter (the only one still alive in 1250), Ingeborg Eriksdotter of Sweden. Birger took great care to secure the kingship for his own sons.\n\nThe Dukes of Mecklenburg's claim to the Swedish throne became reality during a brief reign: Henry II's son Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1318–79), married a kinswoman, a Scandinavian heiress named Euphemia of Sweden and Norway (born 1317 and died 1370). The couple's second son duke Albert III deposed his uncle from the Swedish throne, and ascended as king.\n\nMargaret I of Denmark chose Eric of Pomerania as her heir. Eric descended from the elder brother of Albert III. Monarchs of the Kalmar union were all cognatic descendants of the House of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe agnatic House of Mecklenburg, descended from Euphemia's youngest son Magnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg, continued to keep their claim to the throne, and occasionally stirred the situation in Scandinavia.\n\nThe Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) was the only medieval Scandinavian realm whose kingship was hereditary, not elective. Already when Olav IV of Norway was young and his mother Margaret was regent, the Dukes of Mecklenburg advanced their claims.\n\nThe Dukes of Mecklenburg's claim to the Norwegian throne was based on their descent from Euphemia of Sweden, granddaughter of Haakon V of Norway.\n\nWhen Olav IV died in 1387, Norway was without a monarch but under the regency of Margaret. She soon chose an heir, Eric of Pomerania, whose mother Maria of Mecklenburg had been Euphemia's eldest granddaughter.\n\nWhen Eric's nephew king Christopher died (before the death of the deposed Eric III of Norway), after some hiatus another magnate, Christian VIII of Oldenburg, descended in the female line from Euphemia and the Mecklenburg family (Euphemia's daughter's great-grandson), was chosen as king of Norway in 1450, this time passing over his cousin and male-line rival, Duke Henry the Fat of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe Dukes of Mecklenburg continued to regard themselves as the rightful heirs to the throne of Norway but they were unable to gain the kingdom from the Oldenburgs.\n\nAround 1711, a treaty was signed between the Dukes of Mecklenburg and the Elector of Brandenburg through which the elector was recognized as the next heir of Mecklenburg after the male lines of the genealogical house of Mecklenburg. Thereby the electors, later kings of Prussia, regarded themselves as having become members of the House of Mecklenburg and started to use its titles, e.g. Duke of Mecklenburg, among their own titulary.\n\nThe legality of that treaty concession has been, and still is under discussion, because not all of the then agnates of the House participated in the deed, and at least one of them was then underage.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the duchy was divided several times between agnates of the ducal house. Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Mecklenburg-Strelitz were typical partition principalities. Until the late 18th century, most parts had returned to the senior branch (Schwerin), after which the patrimony was divided in two states until the very end of monarchy in Germany:\n\n\nThese were elevated to grand duchies by recognition of the Congress of Vienna. In 1918, less than a year before the elimination of the monarchy, the main line of Strelitz became extinct and the then Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin stepped in as regent, but succession unclarities (there was a junior Strelitz branch living in Russia) were not solved until the small monarchies both were dissolved to republics.\n\nThe House of Mecklenburg-Schwerin became extinct in the male line on 31 July 2001 with the death of Hereditary Grand Duke Frederick Francis of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the eldest son and heir of the last reigning Grand Duke, Frederick Francis IV.\n\nThe remaining members of the House of Mecklenburg-Schwerin are the daughters of Duke Christian Ludwig, the second son of Frederick Francis IV, the Duchesses Donata (born 1956) and Edwina (born 1960).\n\nWith the extinction of Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz is now the only surviving branch of the Grand Ducal house in the male line. The current head of this house is Borwin, Duke of Mecklenburg. His grandfather was Count Georg of Carlow, the morganatic son of Duke George Alexander of Mecklenburg (1859–1909). Georg was adopted in 1928 by his uncle Duke Charles Michael of Mecklenburg, the head of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He then assumed the title and style of \"\"His Serene Highness\" The Duke of Mecklenburg\", which was confirmed by the head of the Imperial House of Russia, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich on 18 July 1929 and recognised on 23 December by Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He succeeded his uncle as head of the house on 6 December 1934 and was granted the style of \"Highness\" on 18 December 1950.\n\nIn addition to Duke Borwin, the current members of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz are his wife Duchess Alice (née Wagner; born 1959); their children Duchess Olga (born 1988), the Dukes Alexander (born 1991) and Michael (born 1994); and his sisters, the Duchesses Elisabeth Christine (born 1947), Marie Catherine (born 1949) and Irene (born 1952).\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1921–22, he averaged more than 100 in a series against South Africa. Ryder was an aggressive batsman and strong on the drive. He was also a useful medium-pace bowler. His best performance was an innings of 201 not out against England, made in six and half hours at Adelaide in 1924–25. This included century partnerships of 134 (with Tommy Andrews) and 108 (with Bert Oldfield). He made 88 in the second innings.\n\nIn 1926–27, he made his highest first-class score of 295 (in four hours) for Victoria against New South Wales, in a world record team total of 1,107.

Due to the drying of the wood its current capacity is 219,000 litres (57,854 U.S. gallons). One hundred and thirty oak trees were reputedly used in its construction. It has only rarely been used as a wine barrel, and in fact presently enjoys more use as a tourist attraction, and also as a dance floor since one was constructed on top of the tun.\n\nHeidelberg Castle has a history of enormous barrels; today's barrel (\"Fass\") is the fourth in the history of the Neckar town.\n\n\nWhen the French army captured the castle, the soldiers believed the empty wine barrel to be full of wine; their hatchet marks left on the barrel were later visible to tourists.\nAccording to tradition and local legend, the eternal keeper of the enormous Tun remains Perkeo of Heidelberg, once a court jester and master of the castle’s spirit production (and a famously Herculean wine drinker).\n\nThe Tun is referenced in Rudolf Erich Raspe's \"The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen\",\nJules Verne's novel \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\", Victor Hugo's \"Les Miserables\", Washington Irving's \"The Specter Bridegroom\", Mary Hazelton Wade's \"Bertha\", Mark Twain's \"A Tramp Abroad\" and Wilhelm Busch's \"Die fromme Helena\".

Impressed by the immensity of the Johann-Casimir-Fass, he wrote a poem in 1595 praising the barrel as an apparent proof of the superiority of Calvinism, entitled \"Vas Heidelbergense\" (Poem on the Great Wine Barrel in the Castle of Heidelberg).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866590", "title": "Herbie Collins", "text": "Herbie Collins\n\nHerbert (Herbie) Leslie Collins (21 January 1888 in Darlinghurst, Sydney, New South Wales – 28 May 1959 in Little Bay, Sydney) was an Australian cricketer who played 19 Tests between 1921 and 1926. An all-rounder, he captained the Australian team in eleven Tests, winning five, losing two with another four finishing in draws. In a Test career delayed by First World War he scored 1,352 runs at an average of 45.06, including four centuries. Collins was also a successful rugby league footballer, winning the 1911 NSWRFL season's grand final with the Eastern Suburbs club.\n\nCollins was a keen gambler, a pastime that became habitual during his time as a soldier in the Great War. After the war, he played with the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team (AIF XI) that toured England, South Africa and Australia and was later appointed captain of the team. He was not a stylish or forceful batsman, preferring to rely on nudges and deflections to score runs. His slow left arm off-spin, bowled from a two step run up, was seldom seen after the AIF XI tour. On return to Australia, he made his Test début against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) scoring 104 in the second innings; the fifth Australian to score a century on Test début. He was appointed captain of the Australian team in 1921 in South Africa, when the previous captain, Warwick Armstrong, fell ill.\n\nHis Test career finished in disappointment and in a cloud of suspicion when Australia lost the Fifth Test and the Ashes against England in 1926. While some former players and cricket administrators suspected a case of match fixing, no material evidence supporting this has emerged. After his retirement from cricket, Collins used his gambling knowledge to start a career in horse racing, working as a bookmaker and commission agent.\n\nCollins was born in Darlinghurst, an inner suburb of Sydney, the son of Thomas, an accountant, and Emma (née Charlton). He attended Albion Street (Superior) Public School, where he showed an aptitude for cricket and rugby union. He played his early cricket with Paddington Cricket Club, bowling left arm spinners and batting well enough to be selected at 19 for the New South Wales cricket team (NSW).\n\nHe made his first-class cricket debut against South Australia in 1909–1910 and was disappointing, scoring three and one and taking 1/35. He played one further match for the season, against Victoria. For the next two seasons, his opportunities at first-class level were limited but he managed to play against the touring South African and English sides.\n\nCollins also played first grade rugby league at this time in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. He played at in Eastern Suburbs' grand final win of the 1911 NSWRFL season alongside the great Dally Messenger. He is sometimes confused with, but was not, the Bert Collins who played in Brisbane for Toombul's club, gaining selection for Queensland in 1912.\n\nCollins's first full season for NSW was in 1912–1913, playing ten matches and scoring 598 runs at an average of 42.71. He finished the season with 282 against Tasmania at Hobart. During the 1913 Australian winter, Collins was part of an Australian team that toured North America, playing Gentlemen of Philadelphia and a combined Canada–United States team.\n\nIn 1915 Collins was one of 417,000 Australians who enlisted and was a member of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a reinforcement for the Australian Light Horse. He served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and later on the Western Front, carting ammunition to the artillery shelling the German lines. At the end of the War, Collins was a Lance Corporal.\n\nFollowing the war he was included in an Australian Imperial Forces cricket team, touring England in 1919. Charles Kelleway, an officer, was the captain of the team for the first six matches. Despite Collins's rank Field Marshal Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, asked him to take over the captaincy for the remainder of the tour. Some of his colleagues were officers such as Jack Gregory and Nip Pellew. Collins proved a capable and popular captain with the team losing only four of twenty eight matches during the tour. He scored 1,615 runs including five centuries at an average of 38.45 and took 106 wickets at 16.55 apiece.\nOn their way home the AIF team played ten matches in South Africa, eight of them first-class, remaining undefeated in this section of the tour. While Jack Gregory relished the conditions, the local newspapers acclaimed Collins as the finest player in the touring team. Collins scored 602 runs in South Africa at an average of 50.58 and took 39 wickets at 16.53. In a match at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg against the South African XI, Collins scored 235 from a total of 441 in the first innings as the AIF XI won by 8 wickets.\n\nOn arrival back in Australia, the AIF team played three first-class matches, defeating the reigning Sheffield Shield champions New South Wales and perennial Shield powerhouse Victoria. A likely victory against Queensland was frustrated due to torrential rain. The results in Australia demonstrated the strength of the AIF team and within a few months of the team's dissolution, Collins would make his Test début, along with his AIF team-mates, Gregory, wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield and the batsmen Johnny Taylor and Nip Pellew.\n\nTest cricket returned from its hiatus in 1920 with the English touring Australia. Collins, also a selector, was one of six AIF XI players to make his début in the First Test of that series. The First Test was played on Collins's home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground and Collins had reason to feel at home, scoring 70 and 104. Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test début. Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory. Over the 1920–1921 series, Collins made 557 runs at an average of 61.88.\n\nThe Australians toured England in 1921, the first representative tour since the disastrous 1912 Triangular Tournament. Collins was included in the squad that would win the series comprehensively, three Tests to nil. In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Collins broke his thumb, ruling him out of the next two internationals. He returned to the team for the Fourth Test, after Australia had already wrapped up the series. England had fought back well and Australia were forced to defend grimly. Batting for over four and a half hours with what Wisden described as \"inexhaustible patience\", Collins scored 40 runs in Australia's only innings to force a draw. Collins scored 1,222 runs in all matches on tour at an average of 33.94.\n\nOn the return trip to Australia, the Australian team stopped in South Africa for a short tour. Due to illness, captain Warwick Armstrong was unable to take part in any of the matches and as a result Collins was appointed captain in his place. The first two Tests were drawn but Australia won the third Test and the series at Cape Town. In the second Test of the series, Collins scored a remarkable double century (203) on the matting pitch at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg, unearthing a range of shots he had rarely used. With Gregory, who scored 119, the pair put on a partnership of 209 in 85 minutes, destroying the South African bowling. In six matches played, Collins scored 548 runs, including two centuries at an average of 60.88.\nThe next international visitors to Australia were the English team of 1924–1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting with a young Victorian in his début Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on début. Ponsford later said \"I was most grateful for Herbie taking [Tate's bowling] until I was settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach.\" In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, Collins said to his profligate leg spinner, \"You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance\". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving a gap in the offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking to hit it into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154.\n\nThe Adelaide Test was a thriller with England needing 27 runs to win the Test with two wickets in hand. Collins, ever the gambler, threw the ball once again to Mailey, who was not known for his accuracy or containment. The gamble paid off with Mailey dismissing Tich Freeman and Gregory removing Gilligan at the other end to win the Test by eleven runs and secure The Ashes. Australia won the series four Tests to one. During the Adelaide Test, Collins was approached by a \"well known racing identity\" who offered him £100 to throw the match. Collins rejected the approach and suggested to team mate Arthur Mailey that they throw the visitor down the stairs.\n\nThe 1926 tour of England would be Collins's last. Partly as a result of a wet English summer, the first four Tests of the five-Test series ended in draws. Collins had a disappointing tour, suffering from neuritis and in constant pain from arthritis. He missed the Third and Fourth Tests when admitted to hospital but recovered to resume his place as captain for the Fifth Test.\n\nThe Fifth Test, played at the Oval, saw England win the toss and bat. They compiled 280, Mailey taking five wickets. Australia responded with 302, dismissed late on the second day. At stumps, England – in their second innings – were 0/49. A violent thunderstorm inundated the ground overnight, rendering the pitch sticky. Collins attracted a great deal of negative attention by using the inexperienced Arthur Richardson as a main strike bowler at the expense of the likes of Mailey and Clarrie Grimmett. The English openers, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, took advantage of this by compiling a 172-run opening partnership. England were bowled out in their second innings for 436, 415 runs ahead. Australia were dismissed for 125, losing the match by 289 runs. The Test was to be Collins's last.\n\nSuch was the disappointment at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped not only of the New South Wales captaincy but also that of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy. Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite his reputation as a gambler, there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match.\n\nIn the 1911 cricket off season Collins played rugby league for Sydney's Eastern Suburbs club. A , Collins played alongside rugby league \"immortal\", Dally Messenger when the Eastern Suburbs club won its first ever premiership. He is sometimes confused with, but was not, the Bert Collins who played in Brisbane for Toombul's club and represented Queensland on three occasions.\nCollins was an enthusiastic gambler, renowned by his team mates for finding any reason to bet. Mailey stated that Collins's haunts \"were the racetrack, the dog track, a baccarat joint at Kings Cross, a two-up school in the Flanders trenches and anywhere a quiet game of poker was being played.\" His New South Wales team mate Hal Hooker remarked of Collins:\nHe would bet on anything—perhaps he was the original of the saying about flies crawling up the window. Waiting on a railway line he would bet on how many trains would pass through the opposite platform. how may carriages would be on the next one, how many carriage windows would be open. In a train he would produce a brass top stamped Put and Take—he paid or collected according to which way it fell when it stopped spinning.\nCollins was known for all night poker sessions before going out to open the batting but refused to play against his fellow cricketers, seeing no challenge in taking money from novices. His gambling attracted some criticism and Collins was seen by many, including some cricket administrators, as an inveterate gambler.\n\nHe turned his interest in gambling into a career, taking out a bookmakers' licence for a period and he served as a steward at pony races in Sydney. Neither role appealed to him as much as acting as a commission agent for other bookmakers. Collins would \"lay-off\" for bookmakers over committed on certain horses, placing large bets carefully and with cool calculation. He won and lost two fortunes on the track and at one stage required the assistance of the New South Wales Cricketers Fund to support him and his invalid mother. He re-enlisted in the Australian Army during the Second World War, stationed at Victoria Barracks with the rank of sergeant.\n\nIn 1940, Collins, then aged 51, married 24-year-old Marjorie Paine, the daughter of a race steward. The marriage produced a son before ending in divorce eleven years later; a petition served by Collins was not defended by his wife. After his divorce, Collins continued to frequent gambling clubs at Kings Cross, participating in all-night poker sessions. Despite giving up smoking late in life, his lungs failed him and he died of cancer in 1959, aged 70.\n\nCollins was short, no more than and slight. As a batsman, he was not an extravagant strokeplayer, preferring to avoid risk and leave balls on a good length where possible. He batted with very little backlift and at first inspection could seem strokeless, scoring only from pushes and prods, nudges and dabs. His patience was renowned with the contemporary cricket writer Ray Robinson remarking \"[Collins] had an implacable trench warfare style that in difficult times earned admiration from his own side, put bowlers on the road to exasperation and sent onlookers through the doors of bars.\" His one bold shot was an over-the-shoulder hook shot, finishing standing on his right foot, his left foot six inches in the air. Deficient in driving power, bowlers learnt to lessen his scoring power by pitching the ball well up. He often batted without the protection of gloves, especially on easy pitches.\n\nCollins bowled his slow left arm spinners off two steps, with seemingly little effort. In South Africa while bowling, a batsman was heard to yell \"Collins is getting weary, Why don't you carry him to the wicket?\" After his efforts for the AIF team he seldom bowled long spells again.\n\nPopular with his men, Collins was respected for his faith in his team mates and his ability to relate to different personalities. The Test leg-spinner, Arthur Mailey noted, \"I learnt more of the psychology of cricket from Collins from all the hundreds of cricketers I met.\" Bert Oldfield said of Collins, \"He studied every player's temperament and acted accordingly.\" Collins was undemonstrative, expecting his fieldsmen to look at him every after every delivery and adjust their position in response to his slight hand movements or even a bent finger. He was last to shower at the end of a day's play, preferring to sit in a corner in silence. His team mates assumed that he was contemplating the day's action and pondering on the next day's possibilities. He was a successful Test captain, leading Australia to five wins and two losses; four matches finished in draws.\n\nMany nicknames attached themselves to Collins, including \"Lucky\" and \"Horseshoe\" as a result of his reputation for fortune, especially when it came to tossing the coin. His players called him \"Maudy\" (probably because of his left-handedness) and \"Nutty\"; it is unclear if this was because he used his \"nut\" (head) or was a hard nut to crack. Mailey nicknamed him \"The squirrel\", claiming that Collins eyes glowed at night, enabling him to see better at night than by day. Collins has a bohemian character who enjoyed all night poker and baccarat sessions and evenings at the opera. \"Poker Face\", indeed, was another of his nicknames. He had a light tenor voice himself and would sometimes sing at parties. While in the army, Collins became a chain smoker but he remained a teetotaller, save for an occasional glass of celebratory champagne.\n\n\n"}

In 2014 it became an administrative corporation owned by the Government of Taiwan. NCSIST is involve in product development, manufacturing, delivery, total life cycle sustainment and maintenance. NCSIST fulfills a function comparable to the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) but they also assume mixed roles in competing for and awarding research and development, integration and manufacturing contracts. Along with the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation NCSIST it is considered to be one of the two Taiwanese prime defense contractors.\n\nPrior to the establishment of NCSIST Taiwan has a poorly organized national defense industrial program but the nation was faced with an increasing military threat from the People’s Republic of China and a drawdown in international support and exclusion from international forums. The Republic of China would need to build its own set of hardware, instruments, laboratories, and test sites if it was to secure its independence and security. Preparation for the NCSIST began in 1965, ground was broken on the Shinshin Campus in 1966, and the institute was formally inaugurated in 1969. Early work includes various missile and radar systems, as well as systems integration for ROC military aircraft and ships. The NCSIST was also, and remains, active in military construction. After the United States switched diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China to the People’s Republic of China the Institute became even more important as Taiwanese authorities felt they could no longer view the United States as a reliable defense partner.\n\nIn the 1970s the Institute replicated and produced the 9M14 Malyutka wire-guided anti-tank guided missile as the Kun Wu. The ROC had obtained the 9M14 Malyutkas from South Vietnam. Due to the dated design and low priority placed on anti-tank weapons by the armed forces. By the mid 1970s the Institute employed about 2,000 professionals.\n\nIn the late 1970s the Institute embarked on a project to create a short-range ballistic missile prototype known as the Ching Feng. The project was intended as a pilot project to build the necessary skills needed for a long range missile program. The Ching Feng was a single stage missile which could carry a 450 kg warhead up to 110 km. The type was displayed publicly in 1981 but production was cancelled in 1982 because of significant problems with the solid rocket motor and the guidance system. Overall the type resembled the American MGM-52 Lance. The follow on missile to, to be named Sky Horse, was also abandoned in 1981 under US pressure although interest in the type was revived in the 1990s after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis.\n\nIn the 1980s the Institute worked with Honeywell to design a distributed open architecture combat system to replace the obsolete MK 37 Gun Fire Control System aboard Taiwan's Gearing-class destroyers. This system, called the Modular Combat System (MCS), was the first distributed open architecture combat system in the world and featured easily upgradable COTS components. The system had challenges but did the job and affordable with the architecture, computer, and software are all being developed in Taiwan.\n\nIn the 1990s Taiwan was faced with tightening restrictions on arms imports from the international community as well as instability caused by the transition from authoritarian to a democracy system. The Institute responded the these challenges by widening the scope of its R&D programs and implementing a system of vertical integration. In the late 1990s NCSIST developed a space launch platform based on their ballistic missile technology but this program was put on hold under a combination of US pressure and a promise to subsidize Taiwanese satellite launches using commercial American companies such as SpaceX.\n\nIn 2011 NCSIST awarded MiTAC a NT$70 million (US$2.22 million) contract to build one prototype “Radar Vehicle for Field Operation and Air Defense.” In 2015 police in Taoyuan took into custody three workers and one manager from MiTAC on charges of forgery of data and fabrication of test results. The tender required the vehicle to be able to advance at 8 km/h up a 40 degree incline, the vehicle MiTAC delivered could only advance at 6 km/h. In addition three NCSIST staff were detained on suspicion of colluding with the MiTAC employees to fabricate the test results, these staff then presented the fabricated results to their superiors for approval. The Taoyuan District Prosecutors’ Office began investigating after receiving a tip.\n\nIn 2014 NCSIST was made an administrative corporation by the government, ending its period of secrecy and opening up the opportunity to partner with foreign corporations and export equipment internationally. The new corporate Board of Directors had their first meeting on April 18, 2014. The transition removed a number of restrictions for employees who were now no longer members of the military.\n\nDue to the end of the US Navy’s support of the SM-1 missile system NCSIST has taken over support for the system including production of replacement rocket motors. The same approach was taken for the SM-1’s Mark 13 missile launcher.\n\nIn 2016 NCSIST was awarded a $16.7m contract to carry out a life extension program for the Republic of China Air Force’s stocks of MICA and Magic 2 air-to-air missiles. These two missiles arm the ROCAF’s Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft.\n\nIn 2017 NCIST exhibited again at International Defence Exhibition in Abu Dhabi after a twelve year absence. They exhibited 39 items.\n\nIn the mid 2010s NCSIST partnered with AIDC and the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) to create an advanced jet trainer based on the F-CK-1. AIDC is the prime contractor on the project with NCSIST taking a supporting role. Originally designated the XT-5 Blue Magpie but ruled out as the T-5 Brave Eagle the aircraft is based on the two-seat version of the F-CK-1 but with non-afterburning engines, greater fuel capacity, more stable wing profile, and the removal of the internal gun. The first of four prototypes, designated A1, was rolled out in September 2019. Low rate production is intended to commence in 2021 with mass production beginning in 2023.\n\nNCSIST is participating in the development of the first domestic Taiwanese AUV. In 2019 NCSIST launched an 80-ton 28m long high speed catamaran research and test vessel named the \"Glorious Star\" (光榮之星). Built in the Lungteh Shipbuilding in Yilan County the purpose of the vessel is to shorten the research and development process for naval weapon systems.\n\nIn 2019 Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen ordered the NCSIST to accelerate mass production of the TK-3 and HF-3 in response to increasing Chinese military power and bellicosity. In addition to stepping up missile production the President also ordered NCSIST leadership to focus building up their talent pool and increase partnerships with academia, industry and government at home and abroad. Mass production of the long-range Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile began in 2019.\n\nIn 2019 NCSIST opened Taiwan’s first national unmanned aerial vehicle test site in Miaoli County. The test site is managed in partnership by NCSIST, the Miaoli County government, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Taiwan). The site features a 20m runway and is rated for testing UAVs up to 150 kg in weight. They also entered into an agreement with Asustek Computer Inc to collaborate on cloud-based storage, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things technology.\n\nIn November 2019 NCSIST tested a new short range anti-ship missile from the \"Glorious Star\" which while weighting significantly less than the Hsiung Feng II is said to have the same range.\n\nIn March 2020 NCSIST conducted live fire daytime and nighttime artillery and UAV detection tests which where observed by a People's Liberation Army Navy Hsiang Yang Hung-class survey vessel.\n\nIn April 2020 Chang Chung-Cheng (張忠誠) replaced Gao Chung-Hsing (杲中興) as the president of NCSIST. Gao had courted controversy by deliberately misinterpreting The Classified National Security Information Protection Act. Chang Chung-Cheng is a retired major general who served in the Combined Logistics Command as well as the Armaments Bureau.\n\nThe institute developed nuclear weapons during the Cold War. In 1967, a nuclear weapons program began under the auspices of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) of CSIST. After the International Atomic Energy Agency found evidence of the ROC's efforts to produce weapons-grade plutonium, Taipei agreed in September 1976 under U.S. pressure to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Though the nuclear reactor was soon shut down and the plutonium mostly returned to the U.S., a secret program was revealed when Colonel Chang Hsien-yi, deputy director of nuclear research at INER, defected to the U.S. in December 1987 and produced a cache of incriminating documents. At present there is no claim that any nuclear weapons program is being pursued.\n\nThe institute is divided into six research divisions and five centers. Research divisions pursue both project oriented and basic scientific research.\n\n\n\nNCSIST facilities are located in Taoyuan (four facilities), New Taipei City, Taichung City, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung County.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866599", "title": "Passive house", "text": "Passive house\n\nPassive house () is a voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building, which reduces the building's ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \"MINERGIE-P\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design. Although it is principally applied to new buildings, it has also been used for refurbishments.\n\nBy late 2008, estimates of the number of Passivhaus buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures. As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. \n\nThe Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the \"Institut für Wohnen und Umwelt\" (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany). Later, their concept was further developed through a number of research projects, aided by financial assistance from the German state of Hessen.\n\nMuch of the early 'Passive Houses' were based on research and the experience of North American builders during the 1970s, who—in response to the oil embargo—sought to build homes that used very little or no energy. These designs often utilized the sun as a heat source and the term 'passive house' was possibly derived from the passive solar features of these houses, such as the Saskatchewan Conservation House and the Leger House in Pepperell, Massachusetts. An early book explaining the concepts was \"The Passive Solar Energy Book\" by Edward Mazria in 1979.\n\nThe eventual construction of four row houses (terraced houses or town homes) was designed for four private clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year.\n\nIn September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. As of 2010 an estimated 25,000+ Passivhaus structures have been built. Most are located in Germany and Austria, others in various countries worldwide.\n\nIn 1996, after the concept had been validated at the Institute in Darmstadt, with space heating at 90% less than that required for a standard new building at the time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997).\n\nProducts, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialized during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000–2001. The first to be certified was built in 2006 near Bemidji, Minnesota in Camp Waldsee of the German Concordia Language Villages. The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in Sonoma, California was certified in July 2010.\n\nIn the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \"The Smith House\" in Urbana, Illinois. From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the PHIUS has released their PHIUS + 2015 Building Standard and has certified over 1,200 projects and across the United States. In 2019, Park Avenue Green, a low-income housing building in New York, became the largest certified Passive House in North America.\n\nIreland's first Passive House was built in 2005 by Tomas O'Leary, a Passive house designer and teacher. The house was called 'Out of the Blue'. Upon completion, Tomas moved into the building.\n\nThe world's first standardised passive prefabricated house was built in Ireland in 2005 by Scandinavian Homes, a Swedish company, that has since built more passive houses in England and Poland.\n\nThe first certified passive house in the Antwerpen region of Belgium was built in 2010. In 2011 the city of Heidelberg in Germany initiated the Bahnstadt project, which was seen as the world's largest passive house building area. A company in Qatar was planning the country's first Passive House in 2013, the first in the region.\n\nThe world's tallest passive-house is located in the Bolueta neighborhood in Bilbao, Spain. At , it is the world's tallest building certified under the standard in 2018. The $14.5 million, 171-unit development (including a nine-story companion to the high-rise) consists entirely of social housing.\n\nGaobeidian, China hosted the 23rd International Passive House Conference in 2019, and is home to Gaobeidian Railway City apartment complex is the world's largest passive house project. China is taking a leadership role in passive house construction, with \"73 different companies making windows to Passive House standards.\"\n\nWhile some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the Passive House standard, others, such as superinsulation, already existed, and the concept of passive solar building design dates back to antiquity. There was other previous experience with low-energy building standards, notably the German \"Niedrigenergiehaus\" (low-energy house) standard, as well as from buildings constructed to the demanding energy codes of Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThe Passivhaus standard requires that the building fulfills the following requirements:\n\nThe specific heat load for the heating source at design temperature is recommended, but not required, to be less than 10 W/m² (3.17 btu/h·ft²).\n\nThese standards are much higher than houses built to most normal building codes. For comparisons, see the international comparisons section below.\n\nNational partners within the 'consortium for the Promotion of European Passive Houses' are thought to have some flexibility to adapt these limits locally.\n\nIf a building meets the Passivhaus standards, it does not need conventional heating systems, though some heating will still be required and most Passivhaus buildings include supplemental space heating. This is normally distributed through the low-volume heat recovery ventilation system that is required to maintain air quality, rather than by a conventional hydronic or high-volume forced-air heating system, as described in the space heating section below.\n\nThe PHIUS + 2015 Standard primarily focuses on reducing negative effects of building operations, for any type of building. This standard also uses climate data sets to determine specific building performance criteria for different regions. Such information is determined using metrics that represent a space where significant carbon and energy reduction overlap with cost-effectiveness. Overall, the PHIUS database includes more than 1000 climate data sets for North America. The Institute believes that this approach to the Standard is essential, as North America has variety of different climates and different passive measures may be more effective than others.\n\nThe standard is based on five principles: airtightness, ventilation, waterproofing, heating and cooling, and electrical loads. Within these principles, projects must pass building specified blower door, ventilation airflow, overall airflow, and electrical load tests; buildings must also achieve other measures such as low-emission materials, renewable energy systems, moisture control, outdoor ventilation, and energy efficient ventilation and space conditioning equipment. All buildings must also pass a quality assurance and quality control test - this is implemented to ensure that the building continues to adhere to the regional criteria set forth by the PHIUS’ climate data. These tests and analyses of operative conditions are performed by PHIUS raters or verifiers. These are accredited professionals from the PHIUS that are able to perform on-site testing and inspections to ensure that the newly constructed building is adhering to the construction plans, created energy models, and desired operating conditions.\n\nIn Passivhaus buildings, the cost savings from dispensing with the conventional heating system can be used to fund the upgrade of the building envelope and the heat recovery ventilation system. With careful design and increasing competition in the supply of the specifically designed Passivhaus building products, in Germany it is now possible to construct buildings for the same cost as those built to normal German building standards, as was done with the Passivhaus apartments at Vauban, Freiburg. On average passive houses are reported to be more expensive upfront than conventional buildings – 5% to 8% in Germany, 8% to 10% in UK and 5% to 10% in USA.\n\nEvaluations have indicated that while it is technically possible, the costs of meeting the Passivhaus standard increase significantly when building in Northern Europe above 60° latitude. European cities at approximately 60° include Helsinki in Finland and Bergen in Norway. London is at 51°; Moscow is at 55°.\n\nAchieving the major decrease in heating energy consumption required by the standard involves a shift in approach to building design and construction. Design may be assisted by use of the 'Passivhaus Planning Package' (PHPP), which uses specifically designed computer simulations.\n\nBelow are the techniques used to achieve the standard.\n\nPassive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the Passive house energy conservation and can integrate them into a neighborhood and environment. Following passive solar building techniques, where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area, with principal windows oriented towards the equator - south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere - to maximize passive solar gain. However, the use of solar gain, especially in temperate climate regions, is secondary to minimizing the overall house energy requirements. In climates and regions needing to reduce excessive summer passive solar heat gain, whether from direct or reflected sources, \"brise soleil\", trees, attached \"pergolas\" with vines, vertical gardens, green roofs, and other techniques are implemented.\n\nExterior wall color, when the surface allows choice, for reflection or absorption insolation qualities depends on the predominant year-round ambient outdoor temperature. The use of deciduous trees and wall trellised or self attaching vines can assist in climates not at the temperature extremes.\n\nPassivhaus buildings employ superinsulation to significantly reduce the heat transfer through the walls, roof and floor compared to conventional buildings. A wide range of thermal insulation materials can be used to provide the required high R-values (low U-values, typically in the 0.10 to 0.15 W/(m²·K) range). Special attention is given to eliminating thermal bridges.\n\nA disadvantage resulting from the thickness of wall insulation required is that, unless the external dimensions of the building can be enlarged to compensate, the internal floor area of the building may be less compared to traditional construction.\n\nIn Sweden, to achieve passive house standards, the insulation thickness would be (0.10 W/(m²·K)) and the roof (U-value 0.066 W/(m²·K)).\n\nTo meet the requirements of the Passivhaus standard, windows are manufactured with exceptionally high R-values (low U-values, typically 0.85 to 0.70 W/(m²·K) for the entire window including the frame). These normally combine triple-pane insulated glazing (with a good solar heat-gain coefficient, low-emissivity coatings, sealed argon or krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, and 'warm edge' insulating glass spacers) with air-seals and specially developed thermal break window frames.\n\nIn Central Europe and most of the United States, for unobstructed south-facing Passivhaus windows, the heat gains from the sun are, on average, greater than the heat losses, even in mid-winter.\n\nBuilding envelopes under the Passivhaus standard are required to be extremely airtight compared to conventional construction. They are required to meet either 0.60 ACH50 (air changes per hour at 50 pascals) based on the building's volume, or 0.05 CFM50/sf (cubic feet per minute at 50 pascals, per square foot of building enclosure surface area). In order to achieve these metrics, recommended best practice is to test the building air barrier enclosure with a blower door at mid-construction if possible.\n\nPassive house is designed so that most of the air exchange with exterior is done by controlled ventilation through a heat-exchanger in order to minimize heat loss (or gain, depending on climate), so uncontrolled air leaks are best avoided. Another reason is the passive house standard makes extensive use of insulation which usually requires a careful management of moisture and dew points. This is achieved through air barriers, careful sealing of every construction joint in the building envelope, and sealing of all service penetrations.\n\nUse of passive natural ventilation is an integral component of passive house design where ambient temperature is conducive — either by singular or cross ventilation, by a simple opening or enhanced by the stack effect from smaller ingress with larger egress windows and/or clerestory-operable skylight.\n\nWhen ambient climate is not conducive, mechanical heat recovery ventilation systems, with a heat recovery rate of over 80% and high-efficiency electronically commutated motors (ECM), are employed to maintain air quality, and to recover sufficient heat to dispense with a conventional central heating system. Since passively designed buildings are essentially air-tight, the rate of air change can be optimized and carefully controlled at about 0.4 air changes per hour. All ventilation ducts are insulated and sealed against leakage.\n\nSome Passivhaus builders promote the use of earth warming tubes. These are typically around in diameter, long at a depth of about . These are buried in the soil to act as earth-to-air heat exchangers and pre-heat (or pre-cool) the intake air for the ventilation system. In cold weather, the warmed air also prevents ice formation in the heat recovery system's heat exchanger. Concerns about this technique have arisen in some climates due to problems with condensation and mold.\n\nAlternatively, an earth to air heat exchanger can use a liquid circuit instead of an air circuit, with a heat exchanger (battery) on the supply air.\n\nIn addition to using passive solar gain, Passivhaus buildings make extensive use of their intrinsic heat from internal sources—such as waste heat from lighting, white goods (major appliances) and other electrical devices (but not dedicated heaters)—as well as body heat from the people and other animals inside the building. This is due to the fact that people, on average, emit heat equivalent to 100 watts each of radiated thermal energy.\n\nTogether with the comprehensive energy conservation measures taken, this means that a conventional central heating system is not necessary, although they are sometimes installed due to client skepticism.\n\nInstead, Passive houses sometimes have a dual purpose 800 to 1,500 watt heating and/or cooling element integrated with the supply air duct of the ventilation system, for use during the coldest days. It is fundamental to the design that all the heat required can be transported by the normal low air volume required for ventilation. A maximum air temperature of is applied, to prevent any possible smell of scorching from dust that escapes the filters in the system.\n\nThe air-heating element can be heated by a small heat pump, by direct solar thermal energy, annualized geothermal solar, or simply by a natural gas or oil burner. In some cases a micro-heat pump is used to extract additional heat from the exhaust ventilation air, using it to heat either the incoming air or the hot water storage tank. Small wood-burning stoves can also be used to heat the water tank, although care is required to ensure that the room in which stove is located does not overheat.\n\nBeyond the recovery of heat by the heat recovery ventilation unit, a well designed Passive house in the European climate should not need any supplemental heat source if the heating load is kept under 10 W/m².\n\nBecause the heating capacity and the heating energy required by a passive house both are very low, the particular energy source selected has fewer financial implications than in a traditional building, although renewable energy sources are well suited to such low loads.\n\nThe Passive house standards in Europe determine a space heating and cooling energy demand of pear year, and peak demand. In addition, the total energy to be used in the building operations including heating, cooling, lighting, equipment, hot water, plug loads, etc. is limited to of treated floor area per year.\n\nTo minimize the total primary energy consumption, the many passive and active daylighting techniques are the first daytime solution to employ. For low-light days, non-daylighted spaces, and nighttime, the use of creative-sustainable lighting design using low-energy sources can be used. Low-energy sources include 'standard voltage' compact fluorescent lamps, solid-state lighting with LED lamps, organic light-emitting diodes, PLED - polymer light-emitting diodes, 'low voltage' electrical filament-Incandescent light bulbs, compact Metal halide, Xenon, and Halogen lamps.\n\nSolar powered exterior circulation, security, and landscape lighting - with photovoltaic cells on each fixture or connecting to a central Solar panel system, are available for gardens and outdoor needs. Low voltage systems can be used for more controlled or independent illumination, while still using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps. Timers, motion detection and natural light operation sensors reduce energy consumption, and light pollution even further for a Passivhaus setting.\n\nAppliance consumer products meeting independent energy efficiency testing and receiving Ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical-'natural-gas' consumption and product manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for use in Passive houses. The ecolabel certification marks of Energy Star and EKOenergy are examples.\n\nTypically, passive houses feature:\n\n\nA net zero-energy building (ZEB) is a building that over a year does not use more energy than it generates. The first 1979 Zero Energy Design building used passive solar heating and cooling techniques with air-tight construction and super insulation. A few ZEB's fail to fully exploit more affordable conservation technology and all use onsite active renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic to offset the building's primary energy consumption. Passive House and ZEB are complementary synergistic technology approaches, based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage: ZEBs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kWh/m with help from on-site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the Passive House demand constraint of 120 kWh/m² which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources. Energy Plus houses are similar to both PassivHaus and ZEB but emphasize the production of more energy per year than they consume, e.g., annual energy performance of -25 kWh/m is an Energy Plus house.\n\nIn a tropical climate, it could be helpful for ideal internal conditions to use energy recovery ventilation instead of heat recovery ventilation to reduce the humidity load of ventilation on the mechanical dehumidification system. Although dehumidifiers might be used, heat pump hot water heaters also will act to cool and condense interior humidity (where it can be dumped into drains) and dump the heat into the hot water tank. Passive cooling, solar air conditioning, and other solutions in passive solar building design need to be studied to adapt the Passive house concept for use in more regions of the world.\n\nThere is a certified Passive House in the hot and humid climate of Lafayette, Louisiana, USA, which uses energy recovery ventilation and an efficient one ton air-conditioner to provide cooling and dehumidification.\n\nSolar access is a very important factor in any design of a passive house as it allows the structure to use the solar energy to heat and light the space naturally, replace electrical water heaters with solar-energy-based water heaters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An opening batsman, Bardsley played 41 Tests between 1909 and 1926 and over 200 first-class games for New South Wales. He was Wisden's Cricketer of the Year in 1910.\n\nA strong domestic season in 1908–09 – 748 runs from 9 innings at an average of 83.11 – led to Bardsley's inclusion in the 1909 Australian squad to tour England for the Ashes. After making his debut at Edgbaston, in the city of Birmingham, Bardsley struggled for runs in the Test arena, returning scores of 2, 6, 46, 0, 30, 2, 9 and 35 in his first eight innings. In the Fifth Test, at The Oval, London, however, Bardsley became the first Test cricketer to score a century – 100 runs or more – in both innings of a single Test match.\n\nThe 1910–11 series against South Africa in Australia was Bardsley's strongest Test series – 573 runs at 63.67 in nine innings. The following year, against England, he struggled somewhat and was replaced by the aging Syd Gregory for the Fifth Test. Bardsley returned to Test form in the inaugural Triangular Test series (featuring England, Australia and South Africa in England) ending the series as the leading run-scorer (392 runs at 65.33 from 6 innings).\n\nWorld War I robbed Bardsley of five years of his playing career. By the time Test cricket resumed in 1920, Bardsley was aged in his late-thirties. His form was not the same; in the 21 Tests Bardsley played from 1920 to 1926, he managed only one century. Maintaining his position in the Australian Test squad proved to be difficult, especially considering the fine form of younger opening batsmen Bill Ponsford, Bill Woodfull and Herbie Collins. Despite his Test woes, domestically Bardsley continued to average in the high-30s – low-40s for New South Wales throughout much of the early-1920s.\n\nWarren Bardsley was 43 years old when he made his last Test tour of England, in 1926. After captain Herbie Collins was felled by illness after the Second Test, the captaincy duties fell on Bardsley, despite his inexperience in that field. Both matches under Bardsley's tenure ended in a draw. He was also the oldest captain to make captaincy debut at the age of 43 years and 216 days. Bardsley played all five Tests in the 1926 series; his undefeated innings of 193 at Lord's in the Second Test would be his highest Test score, and made him the oldest player to score a Test century for Australia. It also created a record for the highest individual score in a Test Match at Lord's (beaten in 1930 by Bradman's 254).\n\nAfter his retirement from Test and first-class cricket, Bardsley would briefly serve as a national selector. He continued to play club cricket for Glebe into his fifties. This longevity was attributed to rigorous exercise, rarely eating meat, and abstaining from alcohol and tobacco.\n\nIn 1945, aged 62, Bardsley married 45-year-old Gertrude Cope, his wife until his death in 1954. The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: \"I was just thinking,\" said the old cricketer, \"what a great bloke old Doc was. I was thinking of him, and then I just happened to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, \"Poor old So-And-So. By cripes, he's looking old.\" And then I thought, \"Well, I suppose some of them are looking at me and saying, 'Poor old Bards. By cripes, he's looking old!\"' That's just the trouble. We are all just poor old So-And-So's.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866613", "title": "Senegambian stone circles", "text": "Senegambian stone circles\n\nThe Senegambian stone circles lie in The Gambia north of Janjanbureh and in central Senegal.\n\nWith an approximate area of 30,000 km², they are sometimes divided into the Wassu (Gambian) and Sine-Saloum (Senegalese) circles, but this is purely a national division. According to UNESCO, the Senegambian stone circles are \"the largest concentration of stone circles seen anywhere in the world.\" \"These sites, Wassu, and Kerbatch in Gambia, and Wanar and Sine Ngayene in Senegal, represent an extraordinary concentration of more than 1,000 stone circles and related tumuli spread over a territory of 100 km wide and 350 km in length, along the River Gambia.\n\nThe stone circles and other megaliths found in Senegal and Gambia are sometimes divided into four large sites: Sine Ngayene and Wanar in Senegal, and Wassu and Kerbatch in the Central River Region in Gambia. Researchers are not certain when these monuments were built, but the generally accepted range is between the third century B.C. and the sixteenth century AD. Archaeologists have also found pottery sherds, human burials, and some grave goods and metals around the megalithic circles. A small collection of these can be found in the British Museum's study collection that was donated by the colonial administrator Sir Richmond Palmer. They include an iron bracelet and two spears.\n\nAmong these four main areas, there are approximately 29,000 stones, 17,000 monuments, and 2,000 individual sites. The monuments consist of what were originally upright blocks or pillars (some have collapsed), made of mostly laterite with smooth surfaces. The monoliths are found in circles, double circles, isolated or standing apart from circles (usually to the east) in rows or individually. These stones that are found standing apart outside the circles are called frontal stones. When there are frontal stones in two parallel, connected rows, they are called lyre-stones.\n\nThe construction of the stone monuments shows evidence of a prosperous and organized society based on the amount of labor required to build such structures. The stones were extracted from laterite quarries using iron tools, although few of these quarries have been identified as directly linked to particular sites. After extracting the stone, identical pillars were made, either cylindrical or polygonal, with averages at two meters high and seven tons. The builders of these megaliths are unknown. Possible candidates are the ancestors of the Jola people or the Wolof but some believe that the Serer people are the builders. This hypothesis comes from the fact that the Serer still use funerary houses like those found at Wanar.\n\nThe Gambia:\nSenegal:\n\nWassu is located in the Niani district of Gambia, and is made up of 11 stone circles. The tallest stone is found in this area, with a height of 2.59 meters. The builders of the monuments here possessed great knowledge of their local geology in order to find the sources of laterite stones. They must also have had great technical ability in order to extract these stones without splitting or cracking them.\n\nKerbatch, an area comprising nine stone circles and one double circle, is located in Gambia's Nianija district. Kerbatch also features a V-shaped stone that had broken in three places and fallen. This stone, that had been part of a frontal line, was restored during the 1965 Anglo-Gambian Stone Circles Expedition led by P. Ozanne. During this expedition Ozanne and his team excavated the double circle at Kerbatch.\n\nThe area of Wanar is located in the Kaffrine district of Senegal, and is made up of 21 stone circles and one double circle. There are also numerous lyre-stones. In fact, one third of all Senegambian lyre-stones are located at Wanar. All of the monuments found at Wanar seem to mark burials, according to the archaeologists working there. Researchers have also determined that the site was a burial ground first, and the stones were added later for ritual uses. Construction for this area can be narrowed down to between the seventh and fifteenth centuries A.D.\n\nA current dating program that has begun is yielding estimates that date the construction of the double circle to between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A 2008 excavation was conducted on the double circle at Wanar, and two types of burials were distinguished: simple burials that consisted of large pits sealed with a mound, and more complex burials that were deep with narrow mouths. There was also a presence of perishable materials found in the burials, such as brick and plaster, that suggests the existence of funerary houses built at the time of burial.\nTwo types of stones were found at Wanar: tall and slender stones that tended to be cylindric; and shorter, squatter, trapezoidal shaped stones as well. There is a trend found in which frontal lines do not match up with their corresponding circles, which may suggest a chronological order that the monuments were constructed.\n\nThere are many other clues to be found at Wanar that can tell about what these monuments originally looked like. For instance, the inner ring of the double circle features fallen monoliths that all fan out from the center of the monument. This may suggest, coupled with findings of drystone around the monument, that there used to be drystone beneath the monoliths, and the cylinder made up of the inner ring and drystone was once filled with earth, so that when it collapsed due to outward pressure, the stones all fell outward as well. This theory is not refuted by the fact that the stones of the outer ring fell in all different directions, lacking outward pressure.\n\nPottery shards were also found scattered around the site, buried in different layers of earth. The certain layers in which the pottery was found says that some deposition occurred after the fall of the drystone, but before the collapse of the monoliths. In other words, pottery may have been deposited at this monument after total and/or partial abandonment of the monoliths. Overall, the destruction of this double circle was a slow disintegration over time, as opposed to one large and sudden collapse.\n\nBased on all of these findings, researchers have developed a possible model for the funeral activity sequence that took place at Wanar. The sequence has three distinct phases: Phase one includes cutting the graves in the subsoil with funerary rites, such as covering the graves with mounds; phase two is when the standing stones were raised around the mounds; phase three consisted of erecting frontal stones. Phase three may also have been when these monuments became sites of ritual activities and ceramics started getting deposited around them. The creators of this model recognize that other sequences are possible, and the order for the sequence of events at the double circle may have been different as well.\n\nSine Ngayene is the largest of the four areas, and home of 52 stone circles, one double circle, and 1102 carved stones. It is generally accepted that the single burials found here predate the multiple burials that are associated with the construction of the stone circles. The site of Sine Ngayene is located just Northwest of Sine, Senegal, at the coordinates of 15°32′W, 13°41′N.\n\nIn 2002, an expedition was launched in the Petit-Bao-Bolong drainage tributary; it was called Sine-Ngayene Archaeological Project (SNAP). The team found iron smelting sites and quarries located close to the monument sites. They also found evidence of hundreds of homes nearby, dating around the time of the monuments, clustered in groups of 2–5 with remnants of house floors and pottery shards. This evidence suggests the existence of small, linked yet independent communities. Researchers also suggest the possibility that these megalithic cemeteries could have been a focal spot of the cultural landscape and served the purpose of bringing people together.\n\nThe site of Sine Ngayene has a Y-shaped central axis with a double circle (called Diallombere) located at the center of the three branches. Originally this site was surrounded by hundreds of tumuli (burial mounds) that leveled over time through erosion. Evidence suggests that the burials occurred first with the stones being erected later, exclusively for the burials. Often frontal stones were erected on the East side of the stone circles. Archaeologists at Sine Ngayene have constructed a timeline with four distinct, successive cycles. These cycles are based on materials buried in successive layers and the monument construction chronology of the double circle at the center of the site. The approximate date range assigned to this timeline ranges from 700 A.D. to 1350 A.D.\n\nMaterials for the first cycle are located at approximately 1.6-2.0 meters below the surface and are dated between 700 and 800 A.D. The main finding for this cycle was a large, oblong-shaped pit with a concentration of human remains in the form of a secondary burial. The remains were found with five iron spearheads and a copper bracelet. The pit was backfilled and capped with a mound overlaid with scattered laterite blocks. Researchers estimate that the outer circle of stones was built after the initial burial, and two large frontal stones were added.\n\nThe layers analyzed for the second cycle are located at approximately 1.0-1.6 meters below the surface and date between 800 and 900 A.D. For this layer, another oblong-shaped burial pit was discovered. However, this burial area consisted of more selective human bones, mostly long bones, and skulls, buried in discrete episodes. These were also linked to secondary burials. Overall there were ten skulls, thirty long bones, and one iron spearhead found.\n\nCycle three encompassed material between 0.5 and 1.0 meter below the surface, and dates to between 900 and 1000 A.D. This time period is when the inner circle of monoliths is speculated to have been built. Within this layer, a laterite slab was also discovered, which may have been used as a sacrificial table. The majority of the findings, however, consisted of clay sherds, selected bones (long bones and skulls), and human teeth deposited with pottery. It is during this time in which the monument evolved from a selective burial ground, to a broader ritual place, becoming more of a \"public monument\". There was a shift from burials to offerings during this cycle.\n\nThis cycle contains material located from the surface to approximately 0.5 meters below the surface, and is dated from anywhere between 1235 and 1427 A.D. During this period there seems to be a low intensity use of the monument, and some things recovered from this layer may be accidental re-depositions. The majority of findings from this zone were small bone fragments buried with laterite blocks, located primarily in the inner circle of the monument. There were also some sherds found in one spot, and a secondary burial pit containing: 70 bones, seven turquoise beads, and two copper rings. This may suggest long-distance trade among the people who used the monuments. Overall, cycle four contained a mixture of offerings and secondary burials.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the time of his retirement, he had played a world-record 58 Test matches during a career spanning 1890 to 1912. A right-handed batsman, he was also a renowned fielder, particularly at cover point.\n\nGregory was born at Moore Park, New South Wales, not far from the present site of the Sydney Cricket Ground, attending Sydney Boys High School. The Gregorys were Australia's first cricketing dynasty. Syd's father Ned Gregory was one of the eleven Australians selected to play in a match against England at the MCG in 1877 – a match later designated as the first-ever Test. Ned Gregory served as curator at the SCG, occupying this position at the time of the birth of Syd. Syd Gregory's uncle Dave was Australia's first Test cricket captain, and his nephew Jack was the nation's most feared fast bowler of the 1920s.\n\nSyd Gregory made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the season of 1889–90. Six months later, he was selected to tour England with the Australian team. Altogether, Gregory toured England a further seven times – in 1893, 1896, 1899, 1902, 1905, 1909 and finally in 1912 – and South Africa once (1902). He is one of only three cricketers to have batted in every position of the batting order, from one to eleven, in his Test career.\n\nSyd Gregory scored Australia's first double hundred in a Test in Australia in 1894–95 but his 201 was not enough to save his team from a remarkable defeat. They made England follow on after amassing 586 but the visitors then made 437 and bowled Australia out for 166 to pull off an astonishing victory by 10 runs. It was the first time a Test had been won after following on and remained the only occurrence until the famous Headingley Test in 1981.\n\nIn 1912, six of Australia's leading cricketers – including captain Clem Hill – refused to tour England for the inaugural Triangular Test series. A largely untried team, led by Gregory, was selected in its place. Although Australia lost only one of its six Tests, the cricket was overshadowed by the Australian team's poor behaviour. Gregory was heavily criticised for his inability to control the off-field antics of members of his team.\n\nAway from cricket, Gregory was initially employed by the postal service before opening a \"men's shop\" – containing a tobacconist, barber and sporting store among others – with two business partners in Sydney's King Street in the mid-1890s. In 1896, he married a woman named Maria Sullivan. When his business failed in 1902, Gregory was forced to take a clerical job at the Water Board.\n\nSyd Gregory died on 1 August 1929 at Randwick, an eastern suburb of Sydney. He was 59.\n\n\nIn 1948 the New Zealander Dan Reese made this assessment of Gregory as a cover-point:\nFrom Vernon Royle to Hobbs, England has had many fine cover-points, but none to equal Australia's Syd. Gregory. A delightful story that Vernon Ransford told us on one of his visits to New Zealand gives the best flash-light picture one could get of the quickness of movement and unerring aim of little Syd. It was in a match at Lord's when a well-known English amateur hit a ball firmly between mid-off and cover-point, and in his cultured voice called, \"Come one – perhaps two,\" but he was thrown out before even one run had been scored!\n\n\n"}

This is due to the fact that in the 1960s and 1970s Switzerland encouraged young men from Yugoslavia and Turkey to come as guest workers. Initially these young men were only planning on staying in Switzerland temporarily, however, revised Swiss immigration laws in the 1970s permitted family regrouping. Consequently, these men ended up staying in Switzerland as these new laws allowed the wives and children of these young men into the country. Since this time period, most of the Muslim immigration to Switzerland stems from asylum seekers arriving primarily from Eastern Europe.\n\nThe vast majority of Muslims in Switzerland adhere to the Sunni branch. Some famous Muslims of Switzerland include Tariq Ramadan, Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, Xherdan Shaqiri and Isabelle Eberhardt.\n\nThe largest concentration of Muslim population is in the German speaking Swiss plateau. The cantons with more than 5% Muslim population are:\n\n\nGeneva is the only non-German-speaking canton where the Muslim population (6.24%) is slightly above the average (5.40%). Another remarkable demographic feature in comparison to other European countries is the relatively equal distribution throughout the country (compare Islam in the United Kingdom). No administrative unit has more than 8.55% of Muslim population, and no town or village more than 16.8%. The lowest percentage of Muslims in a canton is 1.82% (the Italian-speaking Ticino).\n\n88.3% of Muslims in Switzerland are foreigners (56.4% from former Yugoslavia, mostly Bosniaks, and Albanians from Kosovo), 20.2% from Turkey and 6% from Africa (3.4% from North Africa). 10,000 of the 400,000 Muslims could be converts.\n\nIn the 10th century, Arabs and Amazighs from their Mediterranean Fraxinet base settled in the Valais for a few decades. They occupied the Great St. Bernard Pass and even managed to reach as far as St. Gallen to the north and Raetia in the east.\n\nIslam was virtually absent from Switzerland until the 20th century.\nIt appeared with the beginning of significant immigration to Europe, after World War II.\nA first mosque was built in Zürich in 1963 by the Ahmadiyya community. Muslim presence during the 1950s and 1960s was mostly due to the presence of international diplomats and rich Saudi tourists in Geneva.\n\nSubstantial Muslim immigration began in the 1970s, and accelerated dramatically over the 1980s to 1990s. In 1980, there were 56,600 Muslims in Switzerland (0.9% of total population). This ratio quintupled over the following thirty years, notably due to the immigration from Former Yugoslavia during the 1990s Yugoslav War.\nWhile the Muslim demographics is still growing rapidly, the rate of growth has decreased after the early 1990s. The growth rate corresponded to a factor of 2.7 over the 1980s (10% per annum), a factor of 2.0 over the 1990s (7% p.a.), and a factor of about 1.6 over the 2000s (5% p.a.).\n\nThe burka was outlawed in the canton of Ticino after a citizen initiative to hold a referendum. With 65% in favour of a ban and it was ruled that the ban was constitutional, the ban took effect in July 2016. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to CHF 10,000. One of the primary figures behind this burka ban is now attempting to ban Muslims from praying in public.\n\nIn 2017, an Imam was charged for inciting violence by calling a sermon for Muslims who refused to pray to be burned alive. \n\nIn 2018, a Muslim couple was denied citizenship when they refused to answer questions from members of the Lausanne naturalisation board if they were asked by people of the opposite sex. Their behaviour was found to disrespect a fundamental principle of the Swiss constitution, equality between men and women.\n\nIn September 2018, a ban on face-covering veils was approved with a 67% vote in favour in the canton of St Gallen. The largest Islamic community organisation in Switzerland, the Islamic Central Council, recommended that Muslim women continue to cover their faces.\n\nSwiss Muslim organizations begin to form in the 1980s. \nAn umbrella organization (GIOS, \"Gemeinschaft islamischer Organisationen der Schweiz\") was formed in Zürich in 1989.\nNumerous organizations were formed during the 1990s to 2000s, including\n\nIt is estimated that there are 260 mosques and prayer rooms with connected services in Switzerland. Switzerland has the second lowest mosques per Muslim inhabitant, with about one mosque to every 4000 Muslims in Switzerland.\n\nThere are two Swiss mosques which predate 1980 and the rapid increase of immigration of Muslims from the Balkans and Turkey over the following decades. \nToday, there are numerous mosques and prayer rooms across the country, predominantly in the urban parts of the Swiss plateau.\n\nIn 2007 the Bern city council rejected plans to build one of the largest Islamic cultural centers in Europe.\n\nFour Swiss mosques have minarets, there is a mosque in Zurich, a mosque in Geneva, a mosque in Winterthur, a mosque in Wangen bei Olten. The latter was erected in 2009 following several years of political and legal disputes. In the wake of the Wangen minaret controversy, a popular initiative was passed with 57.5% of the popular vote in November 2009, introducing a ban on the construction of new minarets. The four existing minarets are not affected by the ban.\nAlthough the Swiss People's Party received the popular vote, their campaign was particularly shocked by the conversion to Islam of Daniel Streich, a council member within the party. \nThe campaign also prompted concerns from other countries of how the Swiss electorate is increasingly shifting towards the right.\n\nIn a 2018 survey conducted by Switzerland's Federal Statistics Office, 29% of Swiss respondents said they mistrusted Islam and 11% said they mistrusted Islamic followers. Comparatively, in 2016, 14% of Swiss respondents said that they mistrusted Islamic followers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866623", "title": "Basaveshwaranagar", "text": "Basaveshwaranagar\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is a largely residential neighbourhood in the west of Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is located to the west of Rajajinagar and is sandwiched between the localities of Mahalakshmi Layout to the north and Vijayanagar to the south, spread across multiple sub-localities, three assembly constituencies and seven Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wards. The area of Basaveshwaranagar is often considered as \"West of Chord Road\" as it lies to the west of Chord Road, an arterial road in the western part of Bangalore.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is named after Basavanna (also known as Basaveshwara), a social reformer whose followers comprise the Lingayat community.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar was formed as an extension by the City Improvement Trust Board (currently the Bangalore Development Authority) in stages between the 1970s and early 1980s. At that time (even now unofficially), the area was known as \"West of Chord Road\" (WCR), as it lay to the west of the Chord Road which at the time was considered as the western end of the city. There were also many private layouts in the area formed in the 1970s by public and private sector organisations for their employees such as LIC, Kirloskar Group, SBI and BEML among others. The close proximity of Basaveshwaranagar to the Bangalore City railway station, Kempegowda Bus Station, the Bengaluru Pete, residential-cum-commercial localities like Rajajinagar and Malleswaram and the Peenya industrial area helped its growth. Today, Basaveshwaranagar is an important residential and commercial hub in West Bangalore. But since Basaveshwaranagar is very far away from the IT Corridor (a large area in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Bangalore city with IT and software parks and SEZs), large-scale development in the area has been minimal and Basaveshwaranagar is today considered as one of the greenest and more conservative localities of Bangalore city.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is situated in the western part of Bangalore, about 914 metres above sea level, at 12°98' N and 77°53' E. Nearby areas include Rajajinagar, Mahalakshmi Layout, Nandini Layout, Laggere, Sunkadakatte and Vijayanagar.\n\nThe terrain of Basaveshwaranagar is quite hilly and uneven. The area is known for its steep and hilly roads which rise high and low. The area was also known for lakes such as the Agrahara Dasarahalli Lake, Kurubarahalli Lake and Saneguruvahalli Lake among others. All the lakes have dried up in recent time and residential layouts or parks have been built over them.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is considered to be the least polluted locality in Bangalore city, with real-time air quality level coming well within Good levels of 0–50 most of the time. There is an air quality monitoring station at Saneguruvanahalli maintained by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Bangalore including Basaveshwaranagar itself experiences a tropical savanna climate (\"Aw\"). Due to its high elevation, a more moderate climate throughout the year is experienced, although occasional heat waves can make summer somewhat uncomfortable. The coolest month is December with an average low temperature of and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of . The highest temperature ever recorded is (recorded in March 1931). The lowest ever recorded is (recorded in January 1884). Winter temperatures rarely drop below , and summer temperatures seldom exceed . Receiving rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons ; the wettest months are September, October and August. The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is recorded on 1 October 1997.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is divided into four stages, which are further subdivided into blocks. The area also subsumes sub-localities such as:\n\n\nBasaveshwaranagar comes under three Vidhan Sabha constituencies: Rajajinagar, Mahalakshmi Layout and Govindarajanagar, which are led by former Minister S. Suresh Kumar (BJP), K. Gopalaiah (JD(S)) and former Minister V. Somanna (BJP) respectively. While most of Basaveshwaranagar falls under the Rajajinagar constituency, some sub-localities like LIC Model Housing Colony, Bhimajyothinagar, Kirloskar Colony, Shakthi Ganapathi Nagar, Sathyanarayana Layout, SBI Colony, Kamalanagar and Kurubarahalli come under the Mahalakshmi Layout constituency. Agrahara Dasarahalli comes under the Govindarajanagar constituency. Rajajinagar, Mahalakshmi Layout and Govindarajanagar assembly constituencies in turn fall under the Lok Sabha constituencies of Bangalore Central, Bangalore North and Bangalore South respectively. While Bangalore Central and North constituencies are represented by P. C. Mohan (BJP) and former Chief Minister of Karnataka D. V. Sadananda Gowda (BJP) respectively, Bangalore South is represented by Tejasvi Surya (BJP), who is the youngest Member of Parliament as of 2019.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is spread across seven wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). One of these wards (Ward 100) goes by the name of Basaveshwaranagar itself. Barring this ward and also Ward 74 (Shakthi Ganapathi Nagar), none of the other BBMP wards fully lie within Basaveshwaranagar.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar post office is located along the Siddaiah Puranik Road, opposite S. Cadambi Vidya Kendra. The pincode for the area is 560079. However, the northern parts of Basaveshwaranagar like Kirloskar Colony, Bhimajyothinagar and Kurubarahalli among others come under the Mahalakshmi Layout post office. The pincode for this post office is 560086.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar has its own police station. The police station was earlier located near Havanur Circle opposite to Pavithra Paradise. It was later shifted to its current location on the 1st Main Road, near to the Dr. Ambedkar stadium. It comes under the jurisdiction of West division DCP of Bangalore city and Vijayanagar division ACP.\n\nThe area does not have its own traffic police station and falls under the Vijayanagar Traffic Police jurisdiction.\n\nThe main roads of Basaveshwaranagar are:\n\n\nApart from these roads, there are other important roads in the locality such as 8th Main Road (BEML Layout Road), 15th Main Road (Kamalanagar Main Road), Kurubarahalli Main Road and Thimmaiah Road (Shivanahalli Main Road).\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is easily accessible from both the Green Line and Purple Line of the Namma Metro. The nearest station on the Green Line is Rajajinagar, which is located 2 km from Basaveshwaranagar, while the nearest Purple Line station, Hosahalli, is 3 km away. Basaveshwaranagar's connectivity to the Namma Metro will be further improved after Phase 3 of the Namma Metro is completed, where a line from Magadi Road to Kadabagere passing through KHB Colony and Kamakshipalya will be built.\n\nBangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) runs a good fleet of buses to Basaveshwaranagar, connecting it with all the important business districts in the city. There are seven bus stations in the locality:\n\n\nThe Kempegowda Bus Station for boarding intercity and interstate buses is just 5 km away from Basaveshwaranagar.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is home to many industry, banking and retail outlets.\n\nThe Siddaiah Puranik Road is the main commercial hub of Basaveshwaranagar. It has many stores ranging from supermarkets and bakeries to pharmacies, branded and generic clothing retail and watch shops among others. Many public sector and private sector bank branches are located along this road as well. The Kurubarahalli Main Road and the 60 Feet Road also have many shopping and banking facilities. Off Havanur Circle is the roadside Basaveshwaranagar market, which sells fresh fruits and vegetables apart from serving street food.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is also home to a considerable number of restaurants, which includes international dining chains, ice-cream parlours, coffee shops, multi-cuisine and cuisine-specific restaurants. The locality, due to its considerable North Karnataka population, has many \"khanavalis\" which serve authentic North Karnataka cuisine. Some famous restaurants in Basaveshwaranagar include Pavithra Paradise near Havanur Circle, Sri Guru Sagar, Cave N Dine, Le Arabia, Kadamba and Priyadarshini Grand to name a few.\n\nShri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad, a cooperative known for the Lijjat Papad brand, has an office in Basaveshwaranagar, near Havanur Circle.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar has a considerable number of educational institutions, both at the primary/secondary education and higher education level.\n\nThe area consists of renowned schools such as Carmel High School, Sri Vani Education Centre, National Academy For Learning (NAFL), S. Cadambi Vidya Kendra, St. Mira's High School, VLS International School and Florence High School to name a few. The famous National Public School, Rajajinagar is located just outside Basaveshwaranagar on the Chord Road. There are also pre-university colleges including Carmel Pre-University College, S. Cadambi Independent Pre-University College and Vidya Vardhaka Sangha (VVS) Sardar Patel Pre-University College. One Karnataka Government aided degree college V.V.S. First Grade College.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar also has two government colleges: the Government Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital located on Siddaiah Puranik Road near KHB Colony bus stop and the Government Unani Medical College and Hospital off Havanur Circle.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar has many recreational spaces including parks, open grounds and stadiums.\n\nMost prominent among these recreational facilities is the Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Stadium, which is located on the 60 Feet Road. It is built over the now-dried up Agarahara Darahalli Lake and has several sporting facilities, including a running track for walking, jogging and athletic events, a skating rink, a basketball court as well as facilities for kho-kho, kabaddi, cricket, badminton and taekwondo. It also plays host to Sports Day events of nearby schools which do not have a playground of their own.\n\nAnother prominent recreational space is the Nethaji Subhas Chandra Bose ground at Saneguruvanahalli. It is popularly known as \"Bose Park\" and is built over the now-dried up Saneguruvanahalli Lake. It has both a park with facilities for walking as well as play and gym equipment and an open ground with facilities for playing cricket, football and other outdoor sports.\n\nThere is a famous park in Sharada Colony known as the Sir M. Visvesvaraya Aalada Marada Udyanavana. It was famous for its banyan tree (\"Aalada Marada\" in Kannada), which was more than 500 years old and was home to hundreds of monkeys and birds and hence is also unofficially known as \"Big Banyan Park\" or \"Monkey Park\". The tree collapsed in 2009, however, efforts have since been made to translocate a banyan tree from another location to the park. The park has facilities for walking and also a children's recreational area.\n\nSome of the other parks and open spaces in Basaveshwaranagar include the Motappa Park at Manjunatha Nagar, the Kuvempu ground which is an open space used for playing cricket, football and volleyball, the Swami Vivekananda Park near Shankar Mutt, the Udaya Ravi Park at Kirloskar Colony and the Subhas Chandra Bose Park at Agrahara Dasarahalli, to name a few. The latter park is said to be the first park in Bangalore to offer free Wi-Fi.\n\nThere is a single cinema hall in the locality, the Veerabhadreshwara Theatre at Kamalanagar near to the BEML Layout Bus Stop. It predominantly shows Kannada films.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar has a wide range of medical specialties practiced through these prominent hospitals:\nBasaveshwaranagar has ample number of clinics and nursing homes across. The availability of medicine is fulfilled by the in house pharmacy of these hospitals and many prominent local pharmacies.\n\nThere are many Hindu temples in Basaveshwaranagar. The Sri Avani Sringeri Jagadguru Shankaracharya Mahasamsthanam, a breakaway mutt of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, is located at Basaveshwaranagar, particularly in the sublocality of Bhimajyothinagar at the junction of Siddaiah Puranik Road, Kurubarahalli Main Road, Dr. M. C. Modi Hospital Road and the Mahalakshmi Layout 14th Main Road. This road junction and the surrounding area is commonly known as Shankar Mutt. Even the BBMP ward where the mutt is situated (Ward 75) takes the name of Shankar Mutt. The mutt premises includes a sma\nll temple dedicated to Goddess Sri Sharadamba, a hall used for religious ceremonies and a sub post office with the pincode 560079.\n\nAnother notable temple is the Sri Ganapathi Temple located on the 8th Main Road, near BEML Layout Bus Stop. The temple, situated on a small hillock, includes a small temple complex with temples dedicated to Hindu gods of both the Shaiva and Vaishnavism tradition.\n\nOther important temples in the locality include the Sri Lakshmi Narayana Swami Temple near Havanur Circle, the Sri Subramanya Swami Temple, the Sri Varasiddhi Vinayaka and the Sri Varapradha Lakshmivenkateshwara Temple at Kurubarahalli, the Sri Varasiddhi Vinayaka Temple at Saneguruvanahalli and the Sri Sai Baba Temple at Gruhalakshmi Layout.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar has a very insignificant number of churches, but there is the Trinity Marthoma Church at Kamalanagar, a small church with the congregation being from the Malayalam-speaking Marthoma Christian community.\n\nThere are a few mosques in Basaveshwaranagar such as the Makkah Masjid, Jamia Majid and Masjid-e-Nimra.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866627", "title": "Clem Hill", "text": "Clem Hill\n\nClement \"Clem\" Hill (18 March 18775 September 1945) was an Australian cricketer who played 49 Test matches as a specialist batsman between 1896 and 1912. He captained the Australian team in ten Tests, winning five and losing five. A prolific run scorer, Hill scored 3,412 runs in Test cricket—a world record at the time of his retirement—at an average of 39.21 per innings, including seven centuries. In 1902, Hill was the first batsman to make 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year, a feat that would not be repeated for 45 years. His innings of 365 scored against New South Wales for South Australia in 1900–01 was a Sheffield Shield record for 27 years. The South Australian Cricket Association named a grandstand at the Adelaide Oval in his honour in 2003 and he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nA short and stocky left-handed batsman, Hill had a crouched, somewhat awkward stance. He gripped the bat low on the handle, playing with a strong bottom hand. His batting style was nonetheless attractive and effective and he was especially strong on the leg side and when cutting. Able to score quickly when required, he was also recognised for his patience and strong defence. Hill normally batted at No. 3 and, along with his contemporary Victor Trumper, he was a mainstay of the Australian batting line-up in the early years of the 20th century. Hill had a strong throwing arm and was an excellent outfielder. He was a popular team-mate and captain, respected for his directness, honesty and cheerfulness.\n\nHe played his first first-class cricket match for South Australia while still a schoolboy, aged 16. By the time he was 19, he had been included in the Australian team touring England in 1896, where he made his Test match début. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground two years later, Hill scored 188; his maiden Test century and still the highest score in Ashes Tests by a player under 21. He was named one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1899, despite missing half the English season due to illness. In the 1901–02 season, Hill was dismissed in consecutive innings for 99, 98 and 97. In total he was dismissed between 90 and 99 five times in Test cricket. In 1903–04, Hill was at the centre of a riot at the Sydney Cricket Ground after he was adjudged run out in a Test match against England. With Roger Hartigan he still holds the Australian Test record partnership for the eighth wicket—243, made against England at the Adelaide Oval in 1907–08.\n\nHill had a strained relationship with Australian cricket authorities. He turned down an invitation to tour England in 1909 due to his unhappiness with the contract terms offered. Despite this, he was appointed Test captain in 1910–11 for the series against South Africa. His Test cricket career ended in controversy after he was involved in a brawl with cricket administrator and fellow Test selector Peter McAlister in 1912. He was one of the \"Big Six\", a group of leading Australian cricketers who boycotted the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England when the players were stripped of the right to appoint the tour manager. The boycott effectively ended his Test career. After retiring from cricket, Hill worked in the horse racing industry as a stipendiary steward and later as a handicapper for races including the Caulfield Cup. Hill died in 1945 aged 68 when thrown from a tram in Melbourne in a traffic accident.\n\nHill was born on 18 March 1877 in Adelaide, South Australia, to Henry John Hill (known as John) and his wife Rebecca, née Saunders, and grandson of Henry Hill MHA. Clem was one of eight sons and eight daughters in a family that was heavily involved in cricket. His father scored a century (102 not out) for North Adelaide against the touring Kent County Cricket Club, reportedly the first century scored at the Adelaide Oval. Six other brothers played for South Australia and in 1912–13 there were several instances of three Hill brothers in the same representative team.\n\nClem's father was prominent in the Methodist Church and sent Clem to be educated at Prince Alfred College, the local Methodist school. \"Inter-collegiate\" matches, the annual fixtures against rivals St Peter's College, were fiercely contested. Hill played his first inter-collegiate match at the age of 13, keeping wicket and batting at number ten. His hands suffered from keeping wicket to the fast bowling of future Test team-mate Ernie Jones, leading to a decision to concentrate on batting. At 16, he scored 360 in the inter-collegiate match, a schoolboy record, bettering the mark made earlier by Joe Darling. Despite this, a school sportsmaster threatened to leave him out of the School XI (cricket team) if he continued to play the risky hook shot.\n\nHill made his first-class cricket début in March 1893 while still a schoolboy, just nine days past his 16th birthday. Included in the South Australian team to play Western Australia at the Adelaide Oval, he failed to score a run; he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings and was 0 not out in the second as South Australia won by 10 wickets. In the 1894–95 season, at 17 years of age, he played the touring English team led by A.E. Stoddart, scoring 20 in his only innings in the match.\n\nLater the same season, Hill became a regular member of the South Australian team, making his Sheffield Shield debut against Victoria. Batting at number nine, he scored only 21 but the manner in which he made them saw the Australian Test wicket-keeper Jack Blackham declare the discovery of another great batsman. The English team returned to the Adelaide Oval and this time Hill scored his maiden first-class century, 150 not out, against quality bowlers including Tom Richardson and Bobby Peel. So good was the quality of Hill's batting that when he reached his century a cab driver spectator, sitting on his cab, \"cheered end clapped so much [he] fell through the roof of the vehicle\".\n\nIn his first season of regular first-class cricket, Hill scored 335 runs in nine innings at an average of 47.85.\n\nHill was also a talented Australian rules footballer and played for the South Adelaide Football Club during the 1890s and early 1900s.\n\nHill topped the averages for South Australia in the 1895–96 season, scoring 371 runs in seven innings. An Australian team to tour England in 1896 was selected towards the end of the season and Hill was not included. A disappointed Hill responded by scoring 206 against New South Wales, who were captained by an Australian selector, Tom Garrett. Experienced cricket watchers were impressed with Hill's ability at such a young age to control the strike, scoring 154 from his side's last 197 runs. Following this performance, public demand saw the selectors draft the 19-year-old Hill into the touring squad.\n\nHill was one of four batsmen touring England for the first time; Joe Darling, Frank Iredale and Harry Donnan were the others. All four scored more than 1,000 runs for the tour with Hill scoring 1,196 runs at an average of 27.81. According to \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", Hill \"was a brilliant success\" and his batting on good wickets during the tour was \"first rate\". Hill made his Test début in the First Test at Lord's. Australia collapsed in the first innings to be all out for 53 with Hill bowled by George Lohmann for one. England made 292 runs in reply but the second innings saw an Australian fightback. The captain, Harry Trott (143), was partnered by Syd Gregory (103) to help Australia to a score of 347, setting England 109 runs to win. Hill failed again scoring only five, bowled this time by Jack Hearne. Rain made England's task a little more difficult but they were able to make the runs for the loss of only four wickets. Hill played in the remaining two Tests, but managed to score only 30 runs in the series. Australia lost the series and the Ashes by two Tests to one.\n\nThe next Ashes series was held in 1897–98 with Stoddart again assembling an English team to tour Australia. The team included players such as K.S. Ranjitsinhji and George Hirst. The touring team's first match on arrival was against South Australia and Hill batted well, scoring exactly 200. The First Test was played in Sydney and a minor controversy ensued when officials abandoned the first day's play due to earlier heavy rain without consulting the two captains. The delay did not seem to affect the English who batted first and scored 551, including centuries by Ranjitsinhji and Archie MacLaren. The Australians were forced to follow-on after making 237. Batting again, Hill scored 96 but England managed to win the match by nine wickets. The Second Test was played in Melbourne and Australia fought back, winning by an innings and 55 runs with Hill scoring 58. Another innings victory in the Third Test in Adelaide saw Australia leading the series two Tests to one.\nThe teams returned to Melbourne for the Fourth Test. England started the match brilliantly, reducing Australia to 6/58 on a pitch that assisted the bowlers. Hill, aged just 20, was watching at the non-striker's end as the wickets fell. Hugh Trumble came to join him and together they began to rescue the Australian innings. When Hill reached his maiden Test century, he had scored all but 42 of his side's runs. Hill played balls pitched outside leg stump particularly well and drove beautifully throughout the innings. At the tea interval, Hill, feeling refreshed, mentioned to Trumble that he thought he would \"have a go at them now\". The experienced Trumble cautioned Hill, replying \"You young devil, you have to stop there. Go along as you have been doing.\" Hill and Trumble made 165 runs batting together, still a record for a seventh wicket partnership in Ashes Tests. Hill was 182 not out at the end of the day's play, the highest first-day innings against England in Australia, and leaving the ground was greeted by a barrage of photographers. After a rest day, Hill added only six more runs before being dismissed at last by Hearne. His innings remains the highest in Ashes Tests by a player under 21. Batting for 294 minutes he gave only the one chance at dismissal. The journalist and former Test player Tom Horan wrote \"Hill's innings will be talked of when the smallest boy who saw it will be white with the snows of time.\" Australia won the Test by 8 wickets to recover the Ashes. That summer, Hill scored 1,196 runs in 19 innings including five centuries, the first Australian to score 1,000 runs in a home season.\n\nDuring the Australian team's tour of England in 1899, Hill required surgery to remove a growth in his nose. The after-effects of the operation were more serious than expected; Hill lost an alarming amount of weight and strength and missed around half of the tour. Before this, Hill was recognised by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" as the best of the Australian batsmen that English summer. He scored 301 runs in three Tests at an average of 60.20, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His best performance of the series was in the Second Test at Lord's. Hill scored 135, sharing a partnership of 82 with Victor Trumper, who was playing only his second Test match. Trumper went on to score 135 not out. Hill, who was dropped by Ranjitsinhji fielding at slip when he had made 119, batted for 4 hours and hit 17 boundaries. Australia won the Test, the only one to have a definite result, by 10 wickets and retained the Ashes.\nIn 1900–01, Hill made a then record Sheffield Shield score for South Australia against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval. He batted for 8 hours and 35 minutes for 365, including 35 boundaries. The record stood for 27 years until beaten by Bill Ponsford. Hill averaged more than 100 runs for the season. England returned to contest the Ashes in 1901–02, under the captaincy of Archie MacLaren. The English team was weakened by the unavailability of players such as Ranjitsinhji, Hirst, C.B. Fry and Wilfred Rhodes. The surprise selection was Sydney Barnes, who had played most of his cricket in the Lancashire League. Repeating the result of the series three years earlier, Australia lost the First Test but won the next four comfortably to retain the Ashes. Hill was the leading run scorer in the series, with 521 runs including 99, 98 and 97 in successive innings. He is still the only person to achieve this most unusual feat.\n\nHill was the victim of bad luck during this sequence of scores between 90 and 99. At Melbourne during the New Years Test he scored 99; the first time a batsman was dismissed one run short of a century in Test cricket. In the first innings in the next Test in Adelaide, having scored 98, Hill was caught by Johnny Tyldesley who was standing on the bicycle track surrounding the oval. Tyldesley attempted to call Hill back but Hill declined, saying the captains had agreed that the fence was the boundary, not the track. Under modern laws, he would have been not out and the shot would count as six runs, allowing him his century. In the second innings, Hill's poor luck continued. He chopped down on a ball when 97 and then, to his horror, saw the ball rolling back towards his stumps. He attempted to hit the ball away from the stumps but accidentally knocked the leg bail and was out, bowled. The English writer, Simon Wilde, has described this sequence as an \"unparalleled spell of nonagenarians' neurosis\".\n\nHill visited England for a third time in 1902 with the Australian team who won their fourth successive Test series. In the process the Australians \"beat the records of all their predecessors in the country\" by losing only two of 39 matches during the tour. For the second time, Hill scored more than 1,000 runs in an English summer; 1,534 at an average of 31.95 including four centuries. Rain affected the first two Test matches at Edgbaston and Lord's and both teams moved to Sheffield without a win.\n\nThe Third Test, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane, saw Hill play one of his finest innings on a poorly prepared pitch that made batting difficult. Australia batted first and could only score 194, Barnes taking 6 wickets for 49 runs. In return Monty Noble and Jack Saunders bowled England out for 145 and Australia led by 49 runs on the first innings. When Reggie Duff was dismissed in the second innings, Hill joined Trumper at the wicket. The pair scored 60 runs in half an hour before Trumper was out, caught by the wicket-keeper. He was followed quickly by the captain, Darling, out for a duck. Syd Gregory was the next batsman and with Hill added 107 runs in only 67 minutes. In semi-darkness and facing fast and accurate bowling on a poor pitch, Hill pushed on to reach his century after 115 minutes of batting. He had given two difficult chances, one at slip when 74 and in the outfield at 77 before he was caught by MacLaren from the bowling of Jackson for 119. Australia won the Test by 143 runs. The final two Tests were thrillers. Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by a mere three runs with Trumble taking ten wickets for the match. England won the Fifth and final Test at The Oval by one wicket. Chasing 263, England were 5/48 when Gilbert Jessop began an extraordinary display of hitting, scoring a century in only 75 minutes to help England to victory. Of Hill's form during the tour, \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" said \"Clement Hill played many fine innings, his best performance being in the Test match at Sheffield, but, even allowing for the soft wickets, I do not think he was so great a batsman as in 1899.\"\n\nOn the return trip to Australia, the touring team stopped in South Africa to play three Tests, the first Tests between the two nations. Hill was the most successful Australian batsman in the series, scoring 327 runs at an average of 81.75. In the First Test he made 145 when Australia was in trouble after following-on, an innings described in \"Wisden\" as \"marred by very few mistakes\". In the Third Test, Hill batted through much of the Australian first innings to make 91 not out. Australia won the Test by ten wickets and the series two Tests to nil.\n\nFor the first time under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team travelled to Australia for the 1903–04 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276 runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what \"Wisden\" described as a \"very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration\". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting \"Crock!, Crock!, Crock!\" Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216 runs.\n\nHill toured England for the last time with the 1905 Australian team. The Test series was dominated by what was seen as uninspired cricket with England retaining the Ashes two Tests to nil. The Australian batting suffered from a lack of steadiness and Hill was one of the Australians criticised by \"Wisden\" that season; \"[Hill] would certainly have met with more consistent success if he had retained his old self-control. He was somewhat indiscriminate in hitting at the off-ball, and many a time his impatience cost him his wicket.\" However \"Wisden\" praised his fielding, saying \"Trumper, Hill, and Hopkins did any amount of fine work in the deep field\".\n\nThe Australians recovered the Ashes from the 1907–08 English team, winning the series four Tests to one. England were hit by the loss of their captain, Arthur Jones who contracted an illness that threatened to develop into pneumonia, causing him to miss the first three Tests. Hill, batting with team-mate Roger Hartigan playing his first Test match, set a record in the Third Test in Adelaide. Suffering from influenza and unable to field in the English first innings, Hill joined Hartigan at the fall of the seventh wicket. During his innings, Hill vomited beside the pitch and had to quickly leave the field several times. The pair managed to bat on and take the match into a fourth day. Hartigan, whose leave from work had expired, was relieved to receive a telegram from his employer: \"Stay as long as you are making runs.\" When Hartigan was dismissed for 116, the pair had together made 243 for the eighth wicket—still an Australian Test record. With Sammy Carter, Hill continued before finally dismissed by Jack Crawford for 160, after 5 hours and 19 minutes of batting. At the end of his innings Hill was close to collapse but his efforts assisted his team defeat the English by 245 runs.\n\nAustralia were due to tour England to contest the Ashes in 1909. Hill, along with other senior players, was fighting against a proposal to move the management of international tours away from the players to the new Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches. Hill by now was a team selector and strongly opposed the selection in the team of 40-year-old Peter McAlister, who Hill claimed \"was past his best\" and \"not suited to English conditions\". McAlister was also a member of the selection panel and was able to secure a majority for his selection. Hill accused his fellow selectors of conspiracy and said he had \"decided to wash his hands of the affair\" and that \"he did not consider that the best men had been chosen\". Hill's relationship with McAlister would remain fractious. Hill was also a delegate on the Board of Control, representing the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). At the Board meeting in February 1909 to set the terms to be offered to the players selected for the tour, the SACA delegates were outvoted on every point. Hill declined to accept the terms offered. Since his marriage in 1905, Hill had spent considerable time away from his wife with his commitments during two Test series against England and this may have also influenced his decision not to tour.\nWhen Hill returned to the Test team it was as captain for a series against the visiting South Africa national cricket team in 1910–11. The South Africans, led by Aubrey Faulkner, had a novel bowling attack consisting of several googly bowlers, such as Bert Vogler, Reggie Schwarz and Faulkner himself and the chinaman bowler Charlie \"Buck\" Llewellyn. The South Africans started the tour well, defeating a South Australian team unable to handle the unusual bowling approach. Hill, after consulting with other players, settled on a strategy of hitting the bowlers off their length with aggressive batting. Hill showed the way in the First Test at Sydney, scoring his first 100 runs in 98 minutes. In a partnership with Warren Bardsley, the pair scored 224 runs in only two hours. After just 3 hours and 20 minutes at the crease, he was dismissed for 191; his highest Test score. Australia won the Test by an innings and 114 runs. Australia won the Second Test in Melbourne after bowling the South Africans out for 80 in their second innings, but the South Africans fought back to win the Third Test in Adelaide by 38 runs.\nAustralia won the Fourth Test by 508 runs after being sent in to bat by South Africa, who hoped to trap them on a rain-affected wicket. The Australians managed to end the first day's play at 8/317 to avoid the trap and win the Test. In the second innings, Hill hit another century (100) in only 100 minutes, with \"Wisden\" noting that he \"play[ed] especially well\". Australia won the final Test and the series four Tests to one.\n\nHill's Test career ended in controversy amid another dispute with the Board of Control. He was once again appointed captain of the Australian team against an English side captained by Johnny Douglas in 1911–12. The English team included bowlers of the calibre of Barnes and Frank Foster and, after losing the first Test in Sydney, won all four remaining Tests to secure the Ashes. Hill had a lean season with the bat, managing 274 runs at an average of 27.40. The England bowlers were clearly superior to the Australian batsmen; Trumper was the only Australian to score a century during the Tests. While this series took place, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted right of the players to appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, a group of senior players, including Hill, threatened to withdraw from the next tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, Frank Laver, was appointed.\n\nMatters came to a head when Hill sent a telegram to fellow selector, Peter McAlister, urging the inclusion of the New South Wales all-rounder Charlie Macartney in the team for the Fourth Test in Melbourne. The reply from McAlister—a member of the Board of Control who still bore some animosity towards Hill from past comments—to Hill's request was \"... Still opposed to Macartney's inclusion. If Iredale (another selector) agrees with you as to Macartney's inclusion, I favour yourself standing down not Minnett.\" Hill saw the offer to remove himself from the team as sore provocation and his team-mates scorned the suggestion. Australia lost the Third Test by seven wickets. Macartney wrote later, \"Persistent ill-feeling seriously affected the morale of the side.\" At a meeting held after the Test, the Board of Control rejected the players' petition and declared that the manager would be appointed by the Board alone. At a \"special meeting\" two weeks later, the Board appointed George Crouch from Queensland to the position of tour manager.\n\nThe following day, 3 February 1912, the selection committee met in Sydney to decide the team for the Fourth Test. It was the first time Hill and McAlister had met since the exchange of telegrams. The pair exchanged insults with McAlister sharply criticising Hill's captaincy. Hill retorted, \"In England, Armstrong wouldn't play under you. Did you ever win any except second rate games?\"\n\nMcAlister replied, \"I am a better captain than Trumper, Armstrong and yourself put together. You are the worst captain I have ever seen.\" Hill then warned McAlister to stop insulting him but McAlister repeated the remark. Losing control, Hill struck McAlister a blow across the face. The two then grappled for around ten minutes. Blood was drawn, staining their clothes and splashing on the other men present, Iredale and secretary Sydney Smith. At one stage, fearing that one or both combatants would fall through the window and onto the street, Smith grabbed hold of Hill's coat-tails. The fight ended with a bloody McAlister lying on the floor and Hill, unmarked, standing over him. Hill told Smith he could no longer work with McAlister. Smith then asked Hill to put his resignation in writing and the Board accepted it that evening.\n\nThe crowds at the Melbourne and Sydney Tests gave Hill three cheers when he arrived at the wicket. When Hill reached the batting crease in his last Test at Sydney, the umpire Bob Crockett said \"there were tears in his eyes\". An \"in camera\" investigation into the fracas took place; the Board's only comment on the meeting was to report that it had been \"satisfactorily settled\". Hill was then offered an invitation to take part in the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England. Hill declined the invitation, along with Warwick Armstrong, Trumper, Carter, Noble and Vernon Ransford, who collectively became known as the \"Big Six\". He never played Test cricket again.\n\nAt the age of 43, Hill returned to first-class cricket for one match to assist in its re-establishment in Australia after the Great War. In support of the benefits of some former colleagues, he played in a further two first-class matches with his best score of 66 coming in a game against Victoria. His last match was for an Australian XI against New South Wales played to support Bill Howell's benefit.\n\nIn all Tests, Hill scored 3,412 runs at an average just under 40 runs per innings and including seven centuries. When he retired he had scored more runs in Test cricket than any other player; a record he held for 12 years until surpassed by Jack Hobbs. In 1902 Hill was the first to score 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year; the next to do so was Denis Compton 45 years later in 1947. Prolific in Australian state cricket as well, he headed the South Australian first-class averages on ten occasions between 1895–96 and 1910–11. In successive innings in 1909–10 he scored 175 against Victoria in Adelaide, 205 against New South Wales and 185 against Victoria in Melbourne. He was the only Australian to score more than 17,000 runs in the period before pitches were protected from rain. In club cricket he averaged more than 100 runs for the season on three occasions.\n\nIn 2003, the South Australian Cricket Association named the new southern grandstand at the Adelaide Oval the \"Clem Hill Stand\" in recognition of his contribution to South Australian cricket. Hill was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nHill served an engineering apprenticeship at the government workshops in Islington. On retirement from cricket, however, Hill began a career in horse racing administration. He was employed as a stipendiary steward with the South Australian Jockey Club and the Adelaide Racing Club and in 1937 he was appointed handicapper for the Victoria Amateur Turf Club (VATC) in Melbourne. At the VATC he was responsible for setting the weights for the Caulfield Cup, one of Australia's richest and most prestigious horse races. He served in this role for six years before poor health saw him take a less demanding role at the Geelong Racing Club.\n\nHill married Florence \"Florrie\" Hart, granddaughter of William Hart M.L.C. in Tasmania in 1905. The couple settled in Adelaide and raised two daughters, Lesley and Brenda. When he took up his role with the VATC, Hill and his family moved to Toorak, an eastern suburb of Melbourne. In 1945, Hill was thrown from a tram in a traffic accident on busy Collins Street in inner Melbourne. He was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital and died there soon after aged 68. His body was returned for burial at North Road Cemetery in the Adelaide suburb of Nailsworth.\n\nShort and stocky, Hill was a gifted batsman who could score quickly when required. \"Wisden\" described Hill as a \"specially brilliant batsman on hard pitches\". He had an awkward crouched stance, gripping the bat low on the handle. This limited his forward reach and power and reduced his effectiveness when driving but he compensated for this with quick footwork. Hill's strong bottom hand and his keen eye allowed him to play the cut shot cleanly and with confidence and to hit powerfully on the leg side. He preferred batting against fast bowling rather than slow and medium pace bowlers and he was a fearless exponent of the hook shot. Hill had a tendency to get out in the \"nervous nineties\", being dismissed six times between 90 and 99 in Test matches. This included a sequence in the 1901–02 series against England of 99, 98 and 97 in successive innings.\n\nAn excellent fielder in the deep, Hill had a powerful throwing arm. During a match at Leeds during the 1902 tour of England, he threw a ball from near the boundary, knocking down the stumps at one end and rebounding to hit the stumps the other end. During the same tour at Old Trafford, Hill made a catch that \"Wisden\" claimed \"will never be forgotten by [those present]\". A Dick Lilley hit to square leg looked likely to clear the boundary. Hill himself said he raced for it with a view simply to save a boundary. In the event, he ran round 'close to the boundary' from his position at long on, aided by the wind seemingly holding up the ball to take the catch low down in front of the pavilion in his outstretched hands; one that \"Wisden\" said \"few fieldsmen would have thought worth attempting\".\n\nHill was a man of high ideals and was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his pleasant nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him as honest, direct and without guile. An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to see, so Hill then asked Bardsley, \"Did you catch it?\" When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911–12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was a cheery skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who had to remind Hill that the record was previously his.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1866648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866648", "title": "Monty Noble", "text": "Monty Noble\n\nMontague Alfred Noble (28 January 1873 – 22 June 1940) was an Australian cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-hand batsman, right-handed bowler who could deliver both medium pace and off-break bowling, capable fieldsman and tactically sound captain, Noble is considered as one of the great Australian all-rounders. He scored 13,975 first class runs between 1893 and 1920 and took 624 wickets. He made 37 centuries – including a best of 284 in 1902 – and set several partnership and high-score records for his State team.\n\nHe played 42 Tests for his country, and captained the team for 15 of these between 1903 and 1909. Only the 12th captain of his country, he won eight of these games, lost five and drew two. Between his first Test in January 1898 and his last in August 1909, he scored 1,997 runs at 30.25 and took 121 wickets at 25.00. He complemented his only century, 133 in 1903, by scoring 16 half-centuries. Noble played 39 of his 42 Tests against England, and the other three against South Africa. \n\nIn later life, he coached and played for club level teams, including Paddington Cricket Club with which he had a long-standing connection throughout his career. He moved from banking to dentistry, and published his exegesis on cricket, \"Gilligan's Men\". His elder brother, Ted Noble, also played briefly for New South Wales.\n\nIn 2006, he was inducted into the Cricket Hall of Fame by the CA.\n\nNoble was born in Sydney on 28 January 1873. He was the youngest of eight sons of Joseph and Maria Noble, who emigrated from Egham, Surrey, England. He \"made a name\" for himself in grade cricket with the Paddington club and first played for New South Wales (NSW) as a teenager. He toured New Zealand with NSW in 1893, and in 1894 scored a 152* against an England touring team under Andrew Stoddart which drew English attention to his batting. This cemented his place in the state side, and he was a significant contributor to NSW's consecutive Sheffield Shield victories in 1895–96 and 1896–97.\nOver the summer of 1897/98, Stoddart returned with another England team and were defeated in four of the five Ashes Test matches. Noble, whose first-class form had earned him selection, scored 17 in Australia's only innings of 520, then took one wicket as England stumbled to 315 all out. Following on Noble routed the tourists with 6/49. He ended the series with the best bowling averages for both teams. Australia returned to England in 1899, and Noble experienced his first overseas tour. He scored 116 in a warm-up match and \"impressed English critics chiefly by his patience and defence.\" He played in all five Tests, scoring 367 runs at 52.42, with four half centuries, and took 13 wickets at 31.23. At Manchester he scored 60 and 89, withstanding English bowling for eight and a half hours. \"Wisden\" would later record on his death that \"his patience equalled his skill in defence, while at times he used his height and reach with full effect in driving, pulling, forcing the ball off his legs, and cutting either square or late – a batsman of rare style and execution without any sign of weakness.\" He was in particular noted for his ability to cater his technique to English conditions. He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1900.\n\nNoble faced England in Australia over the winter of 1901/02, scoring 138 runs at 15.33, and taking 32 wickets at 19.00. He then returned to England in 1902 as \"the best all-rounder\" under Joe Darling. In a warm-up match at Hove against Sussex, he scored his career-best 284 in a then world-record partnership of 428 with Warwick Armstrong. He scored 1,416 runs across the tour, at 32.93, and took 98 wickets, though in the Test series he scored only 129 of these runs at 18.42. 1902/03 saw a further 92 runs at 23.00, including another half-century, and took six wickets.\n\nNoble was elected to the Australian captaincy for the 1903/04 Ashes series, however England were victorious. In 1905 the leadership reverted to Joe Darling for the tour of England, but Australian again lost the rubber. Noble nevertheless scored 2,084 runs at 44.34 across the entire tour. His bowling was viewed as weaker than normal, however \"Wisden\" credited his innovative captaincy and field settings. He led his team to England once more in 1909, and reversed a hitherto unsuccessful tour for Australia with innovative captaincy and bowling. In his final Test at The Oval on 9 August 1909, he scored two and 55, though he went wicketless.\n\nNoble returned to State cricket, where in 1908 a testimonial match at the Sydney Cricket Ground had earned him £2,000. He continued at New South Wales until 1920, however with seasonal returns of 23, 54, 201, 80 and 13 runs and wicket totals that surpassed two per season only twice in the years either side of World War I, Noble was past his prime. He retired in 1920 and moved into banking, and then dentistry. He wrote and published several works on cricket: \"Gilligan's Men\" (1925), \"The Game's the Thing\" (1926), \"Those Ashes\" (1927), and \"The Fight for the Ashes\" (1929) and also became a noted commentator and broadcaster. He continued his association with Paddington Cricket Club, and worked for a time coaching junior cricket teams. He died in Sydney on 22 June 1940, survived by his brother who died a year later. He was also a church bell ringer, and reportedly visited many towers in England while on cricket tours.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866658", "title": "Hugh Trumble", "text": "Hugh Trumble\n\nHugh Trumble (19 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer who played 32 Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket—a world record at the time of his retirement—at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, including the authoritative \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket. He was named as one of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004.\n\nA tall and thin off spinner, Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with a penchant for practical jokes.\n\nTrumble made his Test debut during the Australian cricket team's tour of England in 1890, but was unable to secure a permanent place in the Australian side until the 1896 tour of England. When the Australian team next toured England in 1899, Trumble scored 1,183 runs and took 142 wickets; only George Giffen before him had achieved the \"double\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets as part of a touring team in England. He was appointed captain of Australia in 1901–02, when Joe Darling was unavailable due to farming commitments. He retired after the 1902 Australian tour of England but was coaxed back in 1903–04. In his last Test match, Trumble took a hat-trick, his second, in front of his home town supporters in Melbourne.\n\nOff the field, Trumble worked for the National Bank of Australasia, rising to the position of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments interrupting his banking career. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) into a stadium capable of holding over 70,000 spectators. He held this post until his death in 1938 from a heart attack, aged 71.\n\nTrumble was born in the inner Melbourne neighbourhood of Collingwood, Victoria in 1867, the son of William, born in Northern Ireland and superintendent of an insane asylum, and Scottish-born Elizabeth (née Clark). His elder brother, John, also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother, Thomas, was a public servant who served as Secretary for the Department of Defence from 1918–27, and then official secretary to the High Commissioner for Australia in London.\n\nTrumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of Ararat before returning to Melbourne, settling in suburban Camberwell. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble—a keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club—set out a cricket pitch at the family home. He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling. Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, \"Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it\"\n\nTrumble transferred to the Melbourne Cricket Club for the 1887–88 cricket season and was an immediate success. He took 36 wickets that season, finishing with an average of 6.77 runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler Fred Spofforth. He made his first-class cricket debut for Victoria that same season, selected to play against a touring English XI led by Middlesex batsman George Vernon. His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Bowling with Spofforth, in the first innings Trumble took seven wickets for 52 runs.\n\nEarly in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.\n\nThe 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" wrote, \"Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble\" but his \"straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety\".\n\nTrumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield's touring English team in 1891–92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the Players followed by 12/84 against Kent at Gravesend. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one century in all first-class matches on tour. \"Wisden\" noted that \"An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour\" and \"... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine\".\n\nWhen Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894–95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.\n\nTrumble was selected in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, despite a poor domestic season in 1895–96 that saw his place in the touring squad seriously questioned by pundits. The leading cricket journalist, Tom Horan said that as much as he personally liked Trumble, he could not see him as a member of a team for the England tour that season. It was, however, during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up. \"Wisden\" said of Trumble when listing him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, \"...it was not until his third visit, during the past season, that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia\". In that season, Trumble took 148 wickets at an average of 15.81. He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who \"was able to inspire [the English] batsmen with a feeling of apprehension\". \"Wisden's\" summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, \"His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy\" and \"he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [Australian] side\".\n\nEngland won the First Test at Lord's by 6 wickets, Trumble taking one wicket in each innings. The Second Test at Old Trafford was more closely fought. Despite K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring a \"marvellous\" 154 and Tom Richardson \"bowling in his finest form\" the Australians managed to hold on for a 3 wicket victory. The Australians required 125 runs to win in their second innings and were expected to make this target easily. Richardson's skilful bowling however saw Trumble and Kelly batting together with only 3 wickets in hand but with 25 runs still to make. Against excellent bowling and in a tense atmosphere, the pair managed to bat Australia home with the last runs taking an hour to score, mainly in singles. Trumble made 17 not out to follow his 24 runs in the first innings and his 4 wickets. With the series tied at one Test apiece, the Third and final Test was played at The Oval in London. On a pitch damaged by rain, the English batted first and were dismissed for 145. Trumble took 6 wickets for 59 runs, including a 9-over spell of 5 wickets for 10 runs. England fought back to bowl the Australians out for 119. In turn, the Australians restricted England to 84 runs with Trumble taking 6 wickets for 30, to leave Australia requiring 111 runs in their second innings to win the match. Bobby Peel and Jack Hearne combined to bowl Australia out for 44 runs to win the Test by 66 runs and retain the Ashes for England . In the three Tests, Trumble took 18 wickets at an average of 18.83 runs per wicket.\n\nTrumble played in every Test of the 1897–98 series against the touring English, who were again captained by Stoddart. England won the First Test in Sydney by 9 wickets with Trumble's 70 runs the highest score in the Australian first innings. Under the captaincy of Harry Trott, Australia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an innings and 55 runs. Trumble took 8 wickets in the match and in partnership with Monty Noble bowled the English out for 150 runs in the second innings. Australia won the Third Test in Adelaide by an innings and 13 runs; Trumble made 37 runs in the Australian innings and took 1 wicket for the match. In the Fourth Test, Trumble combined with Clem Hill in a 165 run partnership for the seventh wicket, described by \"Wisden\" as the turning point in the innings. Australia won the match by 8 wickets. Australia won the Fifth Test and the series four Tests to one. For the series overall, Trumble took 19 wickets at an average of 28.15 runs per wicket and scored 170 runs at an average of 36.20.\n\nThe 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183 runs and take 142 wickets; he was only the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets in an English season as part of a touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15 wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232 runs at an average of 38.66. \"Wisden\" said of Trumble's batting that season, \"[Trumble] played so consistently well as to make it clear that if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman\". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but \"Wisden\" stated that he \"bowled quite as well as in 1896\" and \"[he] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage ... he was deadly\". Australia won the Second Test by 10 wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5 wickets for 60 runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).\n\nAt the age of 34, Trumble was chosen to captain the Australian team against England in 1901–02 when Joe Darling withdrew to manage his farm in Tasmania after the first three Tests. Australia won the two remaining Tests—the only occasions that Trumble would captain his country in Test cricket—to win the series four Tests to one. Earlier, in the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Trumble took a \"hat-trick\"; only five hat-tricks had been taken in the previous 24 years of Test cricket. He dismissed Arthur Jones, John Gunn and Sydney Barnes in successive balls to complete an Australian victory by 229 runs. In the Third Test in Adelaide, Trumble captured 6 wickets for 74 runs in the England second innings and made 62 not out to help the Australians win the match by 4 wickets. After this success with the bat, Trumble—in his new role as captain—promoted himself to open the batting alongside Victor Trumper. He made only 6 runs, handing the opening batsman role to Reggie Duff for the second innings. Australia won the Test by 7 wickets with Trumble not required to bat a second time. In the Fifth Test, again in Melbourne, Trumble took 5 wickets for 62 runs to help restrict England to a lead of 45 runs after the first innings. In the second innings Trumble took another 3 wickets and, combined with Noble's 6 wickets, helped Australia win by 32 runs. Trumble and Noble were the most successful Australian bowlers during the series. Together they took 60 wickets in the Tests: Noble 32 at an average of 19.00 and Trumble 28 at an average of 20.03.\nTrumble's last cricketing tour of England was in 1902, with Darling returning to captain the Australian team. Early in the tour, Trumble broke his thumb at practice, causing him to miss the first month of the English season. Despite this, when he returned for the final three Tests he took 26 wickets. In the at Old Trafford, Trumble took 10 wickets. This included 6 wickets in the second innings when he combined with Jack Saunders to bowl England out for 120; securing an Australian victory by 3 runs. Trumble, recalling his final over of the match, said \"With the ball greasy [wet] and my boots unable to get a proper foothold on slippery turf, it was the most trying over I ever bowled.\" In the at The Oval, Trumble made 64 runs in the first innings and followed this with 8 wickets for 65 runs in the English first innings. He took another 4 wickets in the English second innings, but this was not sufficient to prevent an English victory by one wicket. Darling bowled Trumble unchanged from the Pavilion end throughout both innings of the match. \"Wisden\" praised Trumble's bowling saying \"Trumble, paying us his fifth visit, bowled perhaps better than ever\", but remarked that \"it must be said that the wet weather and soft wickets were all in his favour\"\n\nAfter playing in one Test match against the South African team on a stopover when returning from England to Australia, Trumble retired from Test cricket, aged 35. When Australia lost to the English tourists in the First Test in Sydney in 1903–04, Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble. He was immediately successful taking 4 wickets for 107 runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second, but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185 runs Selected for the remaining four Tests, his 24 wickets in four Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series. The writer Roland Perry described Trumble's final Test match as \"the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler\". In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne, he took 7 wickets for 28 runs, including a hat-trick, to bowl Australia to victory; \"Wisden\" describing his bowling in the second innings as \"practically unplayable\". The hat-trick, his second in Test cricket, consisted of the dismissals of Bernard Bosanquet, Plum Warner and Dick Lilley on 7 March. He went on to take the wicket of Ted Arnold, ending the match and his career in international cricket.\n\nTrumble was tall and thin, in height. His long face featured prominent ears and a large nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling. The cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Trumble: \"El Greco, with his lengthening touch would have liked to draw Trumble. Hugh's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start.\" English cricketer and author Plum Warner called him \"That great camel, Hughie Trumble.\"\nWhen bowling, Trumble made the most of his height, bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as \"sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird\". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, \"You old devil. You get me caught-and-bowled whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later.\" He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an \"immortal of the art\" who succeeded by \"attacking the batsman's strength\". W. G. Grace called him \"the best bowler Australia has sent us\". While Trumble was able to score 1,183 runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, prehensile fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and he was the first to take 20 catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, \"Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush.\" He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to \"snatch\" at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.\n\nTrumble was known for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, \"He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and changing bowlers.\" On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, \"I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder what my father will think of it?\" Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, \"His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character.\"\n\nHe was popular with team-mates and opponents alike, with a weakness for practical jokes. On board a ship travelling to England, Trumble offered to coach unsuspecting fellow travellers in various deck sports such as quoits. Accepting Trumble's advice, they were made to contort themselves into a number of ludicrous positions to the amusement of his team-mates and other onlookers in the know. To prolong the joke, in his own games Trumble would adopt the same peculiar stance and method he advocated.\n\n\"The first of the great off spinners of the Test-match age\", in 32 Tests, Trumble took 141 wickets at an average of just over 20 runs per wicket. He took 5 wickets in an innings on nine occasions and 10 wickets in a match three times. On retirement, he had taken more wickets in Test cricket than any other player; a record he held for nearly 10 years until surpassed by Sydney Barnes. It wasn't until Dennis Lillee 75 years later that anyone was able to better Trumble's 141 wickets against England. While mainly a bowler, Trumble batted well enough to make 851 runs in Test cricket at an average of 19.79 with a highest score of 70. Trumble was also prolific at first-class level. He took 929 wickets, including 5 wickets in an innings on 69 occasions, and as a batsman, he made 5,395 runs with three centuries and a highest score of 107. For Melbourne Cricket Club, he took just under 400 wickets and scored more than 3,000 runs; winning the club best bowling average on six occasions and the best batting average once.\n\nTrumble was particularly effective in England. After taking 52 wickets on his first tour of England in 1890, his other four visits to England—in 1893, 1896, 1899 and 1902—saw him take over 100 wickets in first-class matches. In 1899, he scored 1,183 runs making him one of only four Australians, with George Giffen, Warwick Armstrong (both three times) and Jack Gregory, to take over 100 wickets and make over 1,000 runs on a tour of England.\n\nThe ICC player rankings have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Trumble achieved the top ranking as a bowler. By June 1896, he was ranked fifth in the world and never again slipped lower; from 1899 until his retirement he was the first or second best bowler in the world according to the ratings. As a batsman, Trumble's ranking peaked at twelfth in the world after the Third Test in Adelaide in 1901–02.\n\nTrumble was the first player to take two hat-tricks in Test cricket. Both hat-tricks were taken against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Trumble played his club cricket. Hat-tricks are extremely rare; in over 131 years of Test cricket to March 2008, there had only been 37 Test hat-tricks and only Jimmy Matthews and Wasim Akram been able to repeat Trumble's feat of taking a second.\n\nTrumble joined the National Bank of Australasia in 1887 to begin a career in banking. While the bank often allowed him time to practice, his frequent absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him. Nevertheless, he was appointed accountant at the Richmond branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908, manager of the Kew branch.\n\nA loyal clubman, Trumble served on the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27 years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association after a period of some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland. During his term as secretary, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000 spectators.\n\nTrumble was a prominent writer about and elder statesman of the game and was conspicuous in his support for journalists calling at any hour. From time to time, Trumble acted as a selector of the Victorian cricket team. In 2001, Trumble was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club Team of the Century, and in 2004 he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame for his contribution to the sport in Australia.\n\nIn 1899, aged 31, Trumble met and fell in love with Florence Christian, aged 19 from Queensland. The couple were married in 1902, with the wedding timed to allow a honeymoon trip accompanying the Australian cricket tour of England. An injury to his thumb freed Trumble from cricket commitments for a while, to his new wife's delight. Together, the couple had eight children; six sons and two daughters. One son, Robert, a renowned musician and writer, dedicated his first book, \"The Golden Age of Cricket\", to his father. Trumble died aged 71, from a heart attack in his home in the Melbourne eastern suburb of Hawthorn.\n"}
{"id": "1866664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866664", "title": "Joe Darling", "text": "Joe Darling\n\nJoseph Darling (21 November 1870 – 2 January 1946) was an Australian cricketer who played 34 Test matches as a specialist batsman between 1894 and 1905. As captain, he led Australia in a total of 21 Tests, winning seven and losing four. In Test cricket, he scored 1657 runs at an average of 28.56 per innings, including three centuries. Darling toured England four times with the Australian team—in 1896, 1899, 1902 and 1905; the last three tours as captain. He was captain of the Australian cricket team in England in 1902, widely recognised as one of the best teams in Australian cricket history.\n\nHe was a stocky, compact man and a strong driver of the ball, playing most of his cricket as an opening batsman. He was a patient batsman and was known for his solid defence, but he was able to score quickly when required. In Sydney in 1897–98, he scored 160 in 165 minutes, including 30 boundaries to assist his team in defeating the English. He was the first man to score 500 runs in a Test series and was also the first to score three centuries in a series. His captaincy was disciplinarian in nature but his teammates respected his broad cricket knowledge. Even tempered with a strong personality, he was a stickler for fair play on the field. His teammates gave him the nickname \"Paddy\" due to a supposed resemblance to the Australian boxer, Frank \"Paddy\" Slavin.\n\nHis cricket career was interrupted several times due to his obligations as a farmer, first growing wheat in South Australia, and later as a wool-grower in Tasmania. He was a member of several bodies dedicated to agriculture in Tasmania, including the responsible authority for the Royal Hobart Show. He was a pioneer in activities such as rabbit eradication and pasture improvement. He entered politics in 1921, standing as an independent in the Tasmanian Legislative Council, where he was a forceful speaker. He retained his seat in the Tasmanian Parliament until his death following a gall bladder operation in 1946.\n\nDarling was born on 21 November 1870 in Glen Osmond, South Australia, the sixth son of John Darling, a grain merchant and his wife Isabella, née Ferguson. He was educated at Prince Alfred College, where he took an interest in cricket. At the age of 15, he scored a record 252 runs in the \"inter-collegiate\" match, the annual fixture against fierce rival St Peter's College. His future Test teammate, Clem Hill, would later beat this record, scoring 360. Not long after, he was included in a combined South Australian/Victoria XV that played the Australian XI in 1886. He made only 16 runs, but the manner in which he made them saw senior players hail him as a future champion.\n\nHis father, disapproving of Darling's fondness for sport, sent him away from his cricket and Australian rules football teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on the farm added size and strength to an already stocky and athletic frame. He was selected for the South Australian team at age 19, but his father would not allow him time off the farm to play.\n\nAfter two years in the bush, Darling returned to Adelaide and cricket. He opened a sports store on Rundle Street, Adelaide and was soon selected to represent South Australia in inter-colonial cricket. He made his first-class cricket debut against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval; scoring 5 and 32 as South Australia won the match by 237 runs. The next season, against the touring England team captained by Andrew Stoddart, Darling made 115, his maiden first-class century.\n\nThe First Test of 1894–95 against England, at the Sydney Cricket Ground, saw Darling make his Test debut. In an innings where Australia make 586 runs, including centuries for George Giffen and Syd Gregory, Darling was dismissed for a golden duck, bowled first ball by Tom Richardson. He played in all five Tests in the series, scoring 258 runs at an average of 28.66 per innings. He was included in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, where he topped the scoring aggregates for the tour with 1555 runs at an average of 29.90, including three centuries. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" stated that Darling \"proved himself perhaps the best of present-day left-handed batsmen\" during the tour. England won the series two Tests to one.\n\nAndrew Stoddart brought another team to Australia to contest \"The Ashes\" in 1897–98. Australia won the series comfortably, four Tests to one. Darling started the season poorly, scoring a duck and one against the tourists for South Australia in a match in which teammate Clem Hill scored a double century. Darling went on, however, to dominate the series with the bat. His maiden Test century, 101 in the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Australia was made to follow-on, was the first made by a left-hander in Tests. It was not enough to prevent England winning by nine wickets.\n\nIn the Third Test in his home town of Adelaide, Darling scored 178 runs and Australia won the match by an innings and 13 runs. He reached his century by hitting Johnny Briggs over the eastern gate and into the nearby park. This is the only time in Ashes Tests where a player has reached 100 with a hit out of the ground. During this innings, he also became the first player to hit a six in a Test in Australia (prior to 1910, a six was awarded only if the ball was hit out of the ground). He later also hit the first six in a Test in England. Returning to Sydney for the Fifth and final Test, Darling scored 160 runs from 253 scored in total. He batted for 165 minutes, hitting 30 boundaries as Australia successfully chased 273 in the fourth innings. His first 100 came in 91 minutes; at the time, the fastest Test century scored. By the end of the season, Darling became the first player to score 500 runs in a series and the first player to score three centuries in a series.\n\nDarling was chosen by his teammates as captain for the 1899 Australian team touring England. The team was one of the strongest seen in England to that time, with the cricket reference book \"Wisden\" stating, \"By common consent the [1899 Australians] formed the strongest combination that had come from the Colonies since the great side captained by Mr. W. L. Murdoch in 1882.\" and that \"Darling proved himself one of the very best captains that ever took a team into the field.\" The Australians lost only three of the 35 matches they played on the tour, winning 16 and another 16 finishing in draws. The only Test to reach a decisive result was the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia won by ten wickets due in part to centuries by Hill and Victor Trumper and a ten wicket haul by fast bowler Ernie Jones. Aside from Hill, Darling was seen by \"Wisden\" as the best batsman among the Australians. \"Wisden\" claimed, \"Up to a certain point the responsibilities of captaincy seemed to tell against Darling, but during the last weeks of the tour he played marvellous cricket.\" Over the tour, he scored 1941 runs at an average of 41.29, topping both the averages and the aggregate for his team, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\n\nDarling's deeds as a cricketer had reconciled his father to his sporting endeavours, but not to his sports store operation. In 1900, his father purchased \"Stonehenge\", a sheep station covering in central Tasmania and ordered Darling to run the property on pain of exclusion from his will. Darling complied with his father's wishes and moved his family to the remote station, along a dirt track from the nearest town, tiny Oatlands. Darling stood out of first-class cricket for nearly two years.\n\nIt was not until December 1901 that Darling was convinced to return by the Melbourne Cricket Club to captain the Australians against the touring English for the first three Tests only. The English, captained by Archie MacLaren, won the First Test in Sydney convincingly by an innings and 124 runs. The Second Test in Melbourne was played on a rain-affected pitch. MacLaren won the toss and sent Australia in to bat on the \"sticky wicket\". Within three hours, both teams had been dismissed; Australia holding a lead on the first innings of 51 runs. Realising the danger the pitch held to his leading batsmen, Darling re-ordered the batting line-up and opened the batting himself alongside Hugh Trumble. The pair held out the English for 90 minutes; Darling considered his 32 runs one of his best innings. Nevertheless, Barnes managed to grab five wickets in the final half-hour to leave the Australians 5/48 when stumps was called. Twenty five wickets fell in the day's play. Importantly, Australia had a 99-run lead and batsmen of the calibre of Hill, Trumper, Reggie Duff and Warwick Armstrong still to bat. The next day, on a perfect pitch, the Australian batsmen established a match-winning lead, eventually winning the Test by 229 runs. In the Third Test in Adelaide, Australia became the first team to score over 300 runs to win the fourth innings of a Test match. Darling, along with Hill and Trumble, led the record making run chase; Darling scored 62 runs. Hugh Trumble captained the final two Tests as Darling returned to his farm. Australia won both Tests and the series to retain \"The Ashes\".\n\nDarling agreed to once again lead the Australian cricket team in England in 1902. In what was a very cold and wet summer, the Australian team won a close fought series against the strong English team two Tests to one. Given the strength of the opposition, this Australian team is often referred to as one of the best Australian teams ever assembled. The team included players of the calibre of Trumper, Hill, Armstrong, Trumble and Monty Noble; all of whom would be later included in the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. The team lost only two matches during the tour, with \"Wisden\" saying, \"No travelling team ever strove harder for victory or more completely subordinated all personal considerations to the prime object of winning matches. They formed a splendid all-round combination\".\n\nThe First Test at Edgbaston finished in a draw. Rain saved the Australians after they were dismissed for only 36 in their first innings; Wilfred Rhodes took seven wickets for only 17 runs. Rain again ruined the Second Test at Lord's when the final two days were washed out. The Third Test, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane, saw Australia win by 143 runs due in part to a century by Hill and Noble taking 5/51. Darling was dismissed twice by Barnes without scoring, the first Test captain to make a \"pair\". Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by three runs; Trumble took ten wickets for the match. The last batsman, Fred Tate, came in with England needing eight runs to secure victory. Darling brought the field in and Trumble prevented Rhodes scoring from the last three balls of his over. This left Tate to face Jack Saunders, who dismissed him with the fourth ball of his over to win the match for Australia. England won the Fifth and final Test at the Oval by one wicket. Chasing 263, England were 5/48 when Gilbert Jessop scored a century in 75 minutes to help England to victory.\n\nThe star for the Australians was Trumper who scored 2,570 runs, easily beating Darling's own record for a colonial batsman in an English season set in 1899. So important was Trumper to the Australian team that Darling, who had previously checked that all the Australians were on board the carriage to the ground, was later simply to ask \"Is Vic aboard?\" before giving the driver the go-ahead. Darling himself had a mixed tour with the bat. \n\nOn the return trip to Australia, the touring team stopped to play three Tests against South Africa, the first between the two nations. Australia won the series two Tests to nil, but Darling's own form was poor. In successive innings, Darling made 0, 14, 6, 4 and 1. After the tour, he returned to Stonehenge and took a two-year break from first-class cricket. In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the touring English in 1903–04.\n\nBefore the Australian team to tour England in 1905 was selected, Darling returned to first-class cricket for South Australia. He won selection in the touring squad and was named as captain. A weaker Australian bowling attack saw Darling resort to defensive measures throughout the tour. These measures included directing Armstrong to bowl his leg breaks down the leg side, where Darling had placed up to seven fielders. These measures, unpopular with the English public, saw 19 matches on the tour finish in draws, three more than the 16 matches won by Australia. \"Wisden\" said, \"Leaving aside Duff's long score at the Oval, Darling was the finest batsman on the side in the Test games, playing superb cricket under very trying conditions.\" At Old Trafford in the Fourth Test, he made 73 out of 105 in less than ninety minutes. His innings included thirteen boundaries, all but one of them being drives. Despite his efforts, England still won the Test by an innings and 80 runs.\n\nAfter losing six tosses against his English opposite number Stanley Jackson during the summer, Darling decided on a different approach before the Scarborough Festival match late in the tour. At the toss, he approached Jackson stripped to the waist and suggested, in fun, a wrestle for choice of innings.\n\nThe 1905 tour was Darling's last Test cricket foray, as he claimed that continuing to tour was unfair to his wife. He retired from first-class cricket during the 1907–08 season. In his first-class career, Darling made 10635 runs, including 19 centuries at an average of 34.52. In club cricket in Adelaide, Joe scored heavily. He averaged 144 for East Torrens Cricket Club in 1899–1900, 98.66 for Adelaide Cricket Club in 1896–97 and 86.20 for Sturt Cricket Club in 1904–05. He continued to make runs in Tasmanian club cricket right through middle age. In 1921, he made 100 runs in an hour, including 29 in one eight-ball over playing for Claremont Cricket Club. At age 52, he made 133 not out during a successful run chase where his team, Break-o'-Day, made 6/219 in 90 minutes.\n\nHe was contemptuous of the newly formed Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches (now known as Cricket Australia), who he saw as attempting to remove control of international cricket tours from the players. He would often refer to cricket administrators as \"Dead Heads\". He later represented the Tasmanian Cricket Association as a delegate to the Board of Control.\n\nFollowing his retirement from big cricket, Darling returned to his Tasmanian sheep station, where he was involved in a range of agricultural activities. He pioneered measures to eradicate rabbits, an introduced pest then in plague proportions throughout Australia. He was an active member of organisations such as the Tasmanian Stock Holders and Orchardists' Association and the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania, the organising body of the Royal Hobart Show. Darling imported South Australian merino rams to improve his flock, and his wool topped the Hobart sales on several occasions. He also introduced subterranean clover to Tasmania.\n\nIn 1919, Darling moved from Stonehenge to Claremont House, around which the Hobart suburb of Claremont later formed. He was elected to the Cambridge electorate in the Tasmanian Legislative Council in 1921 as an independent. He retained his position in the Parliament until his death in 1946. In Parliament, one of his colleagues was Charles Eady, his teammate from the 1896 tour of England. Darling was recognised by his colleagues as a forceful, no-nonsense speaker. In the 1930s, he won an exemption from land tax for small farmers, and toward the end of his parliamentary career, a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate charges Darling had made regarding maladministration. The findings of the commission, released after his death, saw a government Minister and two others found guilty of accepting bribes. Darling was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1938 New Year Honours in recognition of his work as a member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nDarling married Alice Minna Blanche Francis, a wheat farmer's daughter from Mundoora, South Australia in 1893. Together they raised 15 children: ten sons and five daughters. After surgery for a ruptured gall bladder, Darling died in Hobart on 2 January 1946. He was buried at Cornelian Bay cemetery after a Congregationalist ceremony and was survived by his wife and twelve of his children.\n\nDarling had a stocky, compact build, standing and weighing . His teammates thought his dark hair, blue eyes and moustache were similar to the boxer, Frank \"Paddy\" Slavin, and he answered to the nickname \"Paddy\" during his time in cricket. His time working on his father's farm had developed his strength. During his first game for South Australia, he was challenged to a naked wrestle by the fast bowler and ex-miner Ernie Jones, an informal initiation into the team. To his teammates' surprise, Darling managed to defeat the much larger Jones.\n\nThe left-handed Darling was a strong driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was sometimes unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting and that he was at his best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian teammate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.\nDarling holds the record for the most innings in a complete Test Match career (60), without being dismissed lbw.\n\nDarling had a strong personality and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined to be a leader in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort in the face of an Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.\n\nThe journalist Ray Robinson wrote that \"of all Australian captains he came closest to being a disciplinarian\". Regardless, his teammates continued to select him as captain, trusting in his knowledge and understanding of the game. On a wet day during the 1899 tour, a delay in play saw some of the Australians accept an invitation to the Player's tobacco factory in Nottingham. While away, the weather cleared and play began with Darling leading a team of five Australians and five substitutes onto the field. Darling later called a team meeting that saw the culprits fined £5 for breaching team rules. His approach to the hard-drinking Ernie Jones was similarly tough. To ensure that the fast bowler would not drink to excess, he selected Jones as twelfth man in a match against an English county team. When Jones refused to play, a team meeting saw him facing expulsion from the team. Darling spoke to him privately and made it clear that without an apology to his teammates and a promise to curb his drinking, he would be on the next boat bound for Australia. The firm and prompt action had a lasting effect on team discipline during his time as Australian captain. \"Wisden\" noted that \"as a captain he inspired his men to reveal their best form.\" As a captain he was a reformer, suggesting rule changes that included making six runs the reward for clearing the boundary rather than the entire ground, and using of sawdust to fill holes in bowler's run-ups.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866679", "title": "Harry Trott", "text": "Harry Trott\n\nGeorge Henry Stevens \"Harry\" Trott (5 August 1866 – 9 November 1917) was an Australian cricketer who played 24 Test matches as an all-rounder between 1888 and 1898. Although Trott was a versatile batsman, spin bowler and outstanding fielder, \"... it is as a captain that he is best remembered, an understanding judge of human nature\". After a period of some instability and ill discipline in Australian cricket, he was the first in a succession of assertive Australian captains that included Joe Darling, Monty Noble and Clem Hill, who restored the prestige of the Test team. Respected by teammates and opponents alike for his cricketing judgement, Trott was quick to pick up a weakness in opponents. A right-handed batsman, he was known for his sound defence and vigorous hitting. His slow leg-spin bowling was often able to deceive batsmen through subtle variations of pace and flight, but allowed opposition batsmen to score quickly.\n\nTrott made his Test debut in 1888, on a tour of England, and would tour England another three times (in 1890, 1893 and 1896), scoring more than 1000 runs on each occasion. For the 1896 tour, Trott was elected captain by his teammates. Despite England winning the series two Tests to one and retaining The Ashes, Trott's ability as a captain was highly regarded. In the return series in Australia during the 1897–98 season, Trott's team was more successful, winning the five-Test series 4–1 and regaining The Ashes. At a time when the federation of the Australian colonies was under discussion, the victory saw Trott praised as a \"national institution\" and his team as having \"done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together\".\n\nA severe mental illness abruptly ended Trott's Test career at the age of 31. After a series of seizures in 1898, he suffered from insomnia, apathy, and memory loss. Failing to recover lucidity, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital for over a year. After he was discharged, he eventually returned to cricket, and continued to play for his state, Victoria, and club, South Melbourne, into his forties. After his retirement, Trott served as a selector for Victoria for a number of years. Outside of cricket, he worked as a postman and mail sorter. He died of cancer in 1917, aged 51.\n\nBorn in Collingwood, an inner suburb of Melbourne, Trott was the third of eight children born to accountant Adolphus Trott and his wife Mary-Ann (née Stephens). His younger brother Albert also became a Test cricketer. The siblings played their junior cricket with the local Capulet club. Harry transferred to South Melbourne, which played in Melbourne's pennant competition, after scouts for the club noticed him playing park cricket. In his first season, the 18-year-old Trott recorded the best batting average and bowling average for the team.\n\nTrott made his first-class debut for Victoria against an \"Australian XI\" on New Year's Day 1886, scoring four and 18 not out. Two months later, he played his first inter-colonial match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Batting, he scored 54 runs; his innings included a memorable hit over the leg side boundary from the bowling of leading Test all-rounder George Giffen, and he captured seven wickets for the match with his bowling. In 1886–87, Trott hit a double century for South Melbourne in a match against St Kilda and appeared for Victoria against Alfred Shaw's touring English team, claiming four wickets for 125 runs (4/125). During the next summer, he played for a non-representative \"Australian XI\" against Arthur Shrewsbury's XI and George Vernon's XI, two English teams touring Australia simultaneously. His chances for inclusion in the Australian squad for the forthcoming tour of England were enhanced when a number of leading players made themselves unavailable. However, Trott's batting credentials were modest: he had scored only one half-century in 29 first-class innings. At this point, Trott had enjoyed more success with his bowling. Prior to the Australian team departing for England, a change to the leg before wicket (LBW) law that would aid bowlers of Trott's style seemed imminent. The former Australian player Tom Horan wrote: \"There is no bowler in England who has such a fast leg-break, and on a fine, firm pitch many a batsman has saved his wicket by his legs or body in opposing Trott's deliveries.\"\n\nIncluded in the Australian squad to tour England in 1888, Trott was selected in the team for the First Test at Lord's. He had an inauspicious Test debut: he made a duck in the first innings and three runs in the second, and did not bowl. The Australians won the game by 62 runs, only their second Test match victory in England. However, England retained The Ashes by winning the remaining two Tests and Trott's influence on the series was negligible: he did not pass 20 in an innings, and he failed to take a wicket. Nevertheless, his performances in the other matches of the season prompted \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" to write that he, \"... fully justif[ied] his selection by scoring the highly creditable total of 1,212 runs, with an average of over 19 per innings\", and that his fielding was \"excellent at point\". \"Wisden\" was less complimentary about his bowling: \"We have no great opinion of Trott's leg break bowling, and think it probably too slow to be effectual against good batsmen.\" Trott's opportunities were limited as his teammates Charles Turner and John Ferris, \"monopolised the bowling\". \nOn his return to Australia, Trott's batting continued to improve. He scored 172 runs for an Australian XI against New South Wales, his maiden century in first-class cricket. The \"Sydney Morning Herald\" wrote that the innings \"... stamped him as a batsman of the highest class\". In first-class matches, Trott posted 507 runs (at 39.00 average) and claimed 25 wickets (at 17.44 average) for the summer, and hit a double century in a club match against Melbourne. Another good all-round season in 1889–90 ensured his place for the next trip to England.\n\nThe 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen who had refused to tour, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trott scored 1,211 first-class runs (at 20.87 average) with a highest score of 186 against Cambridge University Past and Present, and captured 20 wickets. Disappointed by Trott's performances, \"Wisden\" felt that he \"... barely maintained the reputation he had so honestly gained during the tour of 1888 ... it cannot be said that he came up to expectations\".\n\nIn 1891–92, Lord Sheffield's team (captained by W. G. Grace) toured Australia, the first English side to do so in four years. The presence of Grace contributed to a revival of interest in the game that had waned due to a surfeit of international tours and indifferent performances by the Australian team. The Australians won the series 2–1 to regain The Ashes. In the first Test at Melbourne, Trott scored three and 23, but had greater impact with the ball. Requiring 213 runs for victory, England's score reached 60 before their first two batsmen were dismissed. The Australian captain Jack Blackham then gambled by calling on Trott's often inaccurate bowling. Trott took two quick wickets and the English innings never recovered. In returning 3/52 for the innings, \"Wisden\" noted that Trott \"bowled admirably\". The remaining two Tests were less productive for Trott: he finished with 48 runs (at an average of 8.00) and 6 wickets (at an average of 35.00) for the series.\n\nA reorganisation of Australian cricket took place in the wake of the tour. The first national body to control the game, the Australasian Cricket Council (ACC), was formed to co-ordinate the Australian Test team. Previously, private entrepreneurs and the players themselves organised international cricket. Lord Sheffield donated money to the ACC, which was used to purchase a trophy for the champion domestic team. Trott appeared in Victoria's inaugural Sheffield Shield match, against New South Wales in December 1892. He scored 63 and 70 not out in a winning effort. The ACC appointed Trott as one of the six players to select the touring team for England.\n\nThe Australian team toured England in 1893 to compete for The Ashes. The English won the series one Test to nil, with two drawn to recover The Ashes. Playing in all three Tests, Trott scored 146 runs in the series at an average of 29.20 and in all first-class matches he scored 1269 runs. While Trott did not take a wicket in the Tests, he took 38 wickets in all first-class matches that season. In the Second Test at the Oval, Trott scored 92 runs in the second innings after the Australians were forced to follow-on; an innings described as \"really superb cricket\" and \"the finest exhibition he has ever given in England\". England, regardless, still won the match by an innings. Trott was named as a \"Wisden\" Cricketer of the Year. \"Wisden\" noted that Trott \"batted uncommonly well — much better than in 1890\" but that when bowling he \"did a good many brilliant things against the weaker teams, but he was nearly always expensive and very rarely successful when opposed to batsmen of high class\".\n\nAndrew Stoddart led an English team to Australia in 1894–95 to defend The Ashes. A feature of the summer was the emergence of Albert Trott and the performance of the brothers in tandem. Playing for Victoria against the touring side, the Trotts claimed twelve wickets and held eight catches between them; Harry scored 63 in the second innings. During the second innings of the traditional Christmas fixture against New South Wales, Albert claimed five wickets, took three catches (two from Harry's bowling) and made a run out. In between these two games, England won the first Test at Sydney—a remarkable turnaround after they had been forced to follow-on—by bowling the Australians out for 166 in the second innings. The second Test at Melbourne saw another English victory; Trott played a rearguard innings of 95 in the second innings, to no avail. Attempting to stay in the series, Australia dramatically revamped their team for the next Test at Adelaide. Albert Trott, making his Test debut, was one of four inclusions while Harry was elevated to open the batting. In a match played in intense heat throughout, Harry Trott made 48 on the opening day before he was run out. Albert was the dominant player of the match with innings of 38 not out and 72 not out (both scored from the number ten position), and a bowling return of 8/43 in England's second innings. Australia won the match by 382 runs. In a Sheffield Shield match that followed, the Trotts extricated Victoria from a difficult situation. Chasing 155 to win, New South Wales fell for 99 with Albert taking four wickets and Harry five. In the fourth Test at Sydney, Australia batted first and scored 284 runs (Albert Trott 85 not out) before England were bowled out for 65 and 72 on a wicket affected by heavy rain. Opening the bowling in the first innings, Harry Trott dismissed Archie MacLaren, Johnny Briggs and Stoddart.\n\nThe fluctuating fortunes of the Test series created immense interest in the deciding Test at Melbourne. Spectators arrived from all over the country, with special trains laid on from Adelaide and Sydney. Harry Trott's all-round contribution was a score of 42 in each innings, six wickets and two catches, but England won The Ashes by chasing a target of 297 runs in the second innings, which they reached with six wickets in hand. Even in England, \"the interest was greater than had ever been felt in matches played away from [England]\".\n\nDuring the following summer, Trott again acted as a Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain Percy McDonnell. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of promising young players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and kept walking.\n\nWhile the team was en route to England, the players elected Trott as captain ahead of George Giffen. On the opening day of the first Test at Lord's, England bowled Australia out in 75 minutes for only 53 runs on a pitch thought to be good for batting. In reply, England made 292 with Trott taking two wickets. In their second innings, Australia was still 177 runs in arrears with three wickets down when Syd Gregory joined Trott at the crease. Their partnership of 221 runs led \"Wisden\" to record that, \"as long as cricket is played ... cause the match to be remembered\". Trott's score of 143 (the only Test century of his career) was not enough to prevent England winning by six wickets. In the second Test at Manchester, Australia again batted first, scoring 412 runs; Frank Iredale making 108 and Trott 53. At the beginning of England's first innings, Trott opened the bowling with his flighted leg-spin. It was unusual for a leg-spinner to take the new ball, but the move—a \"stroke of genius\" according to \"Wisden\"—was successful as he dismissed Stoddart and W. G. Grace for low scores. Both batsmen were deceived by Trott's flight and stumped by the wicket-keeper. England totaled 231 and, forced to follow on, scored 305 runs in the second innings, K. S. Ranjitsinhji making 154 not out. In a tense finish, Australia made the 125 runs needed for victory with three wickets in hand. On a pitch affected by rain, England won the series and The Ashes, defeating Australia in the Third Test by 66 runs; Australia were bowled out for 44 runs in the second innings, at one stage having lost nine wickets for 25.\n\nTrott made 1297 runs and took 44 wickets in first-class matches on the tour. Of his batting \"Wisden\" said \"Trott's average is a little disappointing, but when a special effort was required he was not often at fault.\" and he bowled \"on a good many occasions with fair results\". However it was as a captain that Trott earned most plaudits. \"Wisden\" rated Trott as \"with the exception of [Billy Murdoch], ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country\".\n\nAlthough the team was considered successful, in spite of the failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.\n\nTrott retained the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897–98. Stoddart's team got away to a good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175 runs. With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring. An exponent of the leg glance, \"Ranji\" would take a last look at the field before he took guard. Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the off side with two men placed about away from him. Bowling a leg side line, the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side. Darling said of the plan, \"As soon as he had his last look and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game.\" The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, \"Ranji is in a blue funk\". Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457 runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series.\n\nAustralia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an innings and 55 runs with Trott scoring 79 runs. The Third and Fourth Tests were both won by Australia as they retrieved The Ashes. The Fifth and final Test in Sydney would be Trott's last. In the Sydney heat, Australia won the Test by 6 wickets but Trott had an attack of sunstroke. This caused him to lose the sight in one eye before his last Test innings, where he made 18 runs. In a review of the Test series \"Wisden\" noted that \"the Australians owed much to the unfailing skill and tact of Trott as a captain\".\n\nDuring the course of the Test series, a major convention was in progress to discuss the proposed federation of the Australian colonies. However, the victory over England dominated the attention of the Australian public and some newspapers decried the focus on cricket when important matters were being discussed. Another editor remarked in defence of the public, \"We believe that Harry Trott and his ten good men and true have done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together.\" In reply to complaints about leave granted to Trott to play cricket, his proud employers at the Post office responded \"Harry Trott is a national institution.\" Passers-by, including men and their families, would stop and look at Trott's home in Albert Park \"with the deference of worshippers at a shrine\", in the words of cricket writer Ray Robinson.\n\nThe impetus for federation did not extend to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and at a meeting of the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.\nLess than six months after leading his team to victory over England, Trott endured a severe mental illness. While visiting his mother on 8 August 1898, Trott collapsed and lost consciousness. Later, on the train home with his wife, he had another convulsive fit and yet another at 10 pm that evening, in the presence of a doctor. Trott passed in and out of consciousness over the next four weeks, unable to work or even communicate. His supporters raised £453 to send him for two weeks at a private retreat at Woodend, a small town north-west of Melbourne. The treatment was unsuccessful and Trott continued to suffer from insomnia, memory loss and apathy.\n\nBecause Trott's illness precluded his selection for the 1899 Australian team to England, the Australian captaincy passed to Joe Darling. On 8 May 1899, Trott was committed to the Kew Asylum, a psychiatric hospital in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The facility opened in 1871 during an era when large asylums were in vogue. By the time of Trott's admission, expert opinion had changed; in January 1898 \"The Argus\" reported a specialist's claim that the asylum was likely to make a patient, \"just mad enough to be put under restraint\"—that is, worse rather than better. Trott was recorded as suffering \"dementia\" and \"alcoholism\", although there is little empirical evidence for either diagnosis. Cricket writer Gideon Haigh suggests that his symptoms would possibly be identified in modern times as depressive psychosis and treated with antipsychotics or electroconvulsive therapy.\n\nDoctors observed that Trott continually stood in one place, showing little interest in events around him. A doctor noted on Trott's file: \"Refuses to converse not appearing to be able to follow what is said to him. Answers questions in monosyllables. Does not rouse up when subjects are spoken of that formerly he was interested in.\" Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket, which he did in a \"mechanical, indifferent fashion\". In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him. A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: \"Here is a well-known cricketer, whom we once treated as a hero. But alas! Like everything else, times have changed and he is almost forgotten.\"\n\nIn February 1900, Trott played in a cricket match for the asylum team against the North Melbourne Rovers club. To the astonishment of his treating doctors and his teammates, he scored 98 runs in 40 minutes, including 20 fours and a six. While the doctors remained cautious about his chances of recovery, Trott played in further matches against other visiting teams and in April 1900, he took a hat-trick against a team from the Commercial Travellers Association. Declared to be \"recovered\", Trott was discharged after spending 400 days at Kew Asylum. He returned to the South Melbourne team and captained Victoria against Tasmania at Launceston (taking eight wickets) during the 1900–01 season, but otherwise failed to recapture the form that made him captain of his country.\n\nTo aid his convalescence, the Postmaster-General's Department—Trott's employer—transferred him to the post office at Bendigo in central Victoria. In 1902–03, he turned up uninvited to a Bendigo United Cricket Club practice session and asked to join in. He played five first-class matches during 1903–04, scoring 268 runs at an average of 26.80 and taking 13 wickets at 23.53 runs each. In his final appearance of the season, he led Victoria against Plum Warner's touring English team. He captained the Carlton club for two seasons, before spending two seasons with Fitzroy. During the 1907–08 season, he led XVIII of Bendigo against the touring English team and made a farewell first-class appearance against the tourists for Victoria. Opening the bowling, Trott returned 5/116, including the wickets of England's leading batsmen Jack Hobbs and George Gunn. Trott later returned to South Melbourne, where he played until the age of 44. He led the club on a tour of New Zealand in 1912–13 and in the next season (his last) he topped the club's batting and bowling averages, for the fifth time as a batsman and the third time as a bowler.\n\nTrott spent his entire working life in the Post Office, employed as a postman and mail sorter. He married Violet Hodson in Fitzroy on 17 February 1890 and the couple had one son. In 1911, Trott became a selector for the Victorian team when Hugh Trumble resigned to take the secretaryship of the Melbourne Cricket Club. Trott's high standing in the cricket community saw the other candidate for the position withdraw rather than oppose him. In 1912, Trott took the side of the \"Big Six\", the Australian cricketers opposed to the newly formed Australian Board of Control for International Cricket's attempt to wrest control of touring Australian sides from the players. At an \"indignation meeting\" at the Athenaeum Hall on Collins Street in Melbourne, the \"Argus\" reported Trott as saying that \"to say he was disgusted with the Board of Control was to put it mildly\" and that \"[h]e would like to shake hands with the six men who had stood out against the Board\".\n\nAt the age of 51, Trott died of Hodgkin's lymphoma, at his home in inner-suburban Albert Park on 9 November 1917. He was buried at Brighton Cemetery where, two years later, a large monument was erected over his grave, paid for by the Victorian Cricket Association and cricket enthusiasts. His great-grandson, Stuart Trott, played 200 games for St Kilda and Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League between 1967 and 1977. The South African-born English cricketer Jonathan Trott says he is a distant relation to Harry and Albert Trott.\n\nTrott's role in Australian cricket was recognised by the clubs for which he had played. Until 2005, Trott's club team, South Melbourne Cricket Club was based at Harry Trott Oval in Albert Park, while Bendigo United Cricket Club, for whom Trott played in 1902, still play at the Harry Trott Oval in the Bendigo suburb of Kennington.\n\nThe authoritative cricket journal \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", in an obituary, wrote \"Australia has produced greater cricketers than Harry Trott, but in his day he held a place in the front rank of the world's famous players. He was a first-rate bat, a fine field at point, and his leg breaks made him a very effective change bowler.\" As a batsman, Trott scored his runs mostly in front the wicket. He often lifted his on-drives and was an exponent of the late cut. George Giffen said of Trott, \"On a good wicket, I have seen Harry Trott adopt forcing tactics worthy of the big hitter, and in the very next match play keeps on a difficult pitch with wonderful skill.\" \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" described Trott as \"one of the soundest [Australian batsman], combining as he does vigorous hitting with a strong, watchful defence\".\n\nTrott was able to obtain turn from all types of pitches bowling his loopy leg spinners, through varying his pace and flight. He was noted for giving young batsmen a full toss on the leg side, allowing the batsman to hit it to the boundary. The next ball would seem identical, but for a subtle change in the position of a fielder, resulting in a catch and the comment, \"That first ball was to give you confidence, son. The second to teach you a lesson.\" Warwick Armstrong, a childhood admirer and later teammate of Trott, said \"Trott had an almost uncanny knowledge of batsman who were likely to succumb to his wiles and after he had met with a success, he would at once take himself off and put on some other bowler of a different type.\" \"Wisden\" thought his bowling was \"too slow to be effectual against good batsmen\" and \"that though he may now and then get a wicket, runs are sure to come at the rate of six or eight an over\".\n\nClem Hill said, \"As a captain Harry Trott was in a class by himself—the best I ever played under. Harry was quick to grasp a situation. He saw an opponent's weakness in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like.\" The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain \"without a superior anywhere today\". \"Wisden\" thought him, \"with the exception of <nowiki>[</nowiki>Billy Murdoch<nowiki>]</nowiki> ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country.\" The sporting newspaper \"The Referee\" wrote, \"[Trott's] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles.\" Some English professional cricketers thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper William Storer said, \"I like a captain to have a settled plan, [Trott] just seemed to do whatever he thought of at the moment.\"\n\nTrott's sense of humour was well known. He originated a persistent myth that workers at the Sheffield steelworks generated extra plumes of smoke when the Australians were batting at nearby Bramall Lane, in order to reduce the quality of the light. When Australia played the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in the United States, a local reporter asked Trott why Australians did not play baseball. He replied: \"Running around in circles makes us giddy.\" When Trott, a humble postman, met the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) in 1896, his teammates admired his natural ease of manner in the presence of royalty. Given a cigar by the Prince, Trott simply smoked it, to the surprise of those who thought a royal souvenir worth keeping. With this in mind, Trott later played a practical joke when he returned home. Gathering cigar butts on board the ship before disembarking in Australia, he distributed them to his friends claiming it was the one given to him by the Prince of Wales; he asked the recipients not to tell others in case it provoked jealousy. Trott was extremely fond of hats; a teammate described him as \"... the only man I have seen who, in the nude, had to have a hat on his head\".\n\nJack Pollard wrote \"It was said that [Trott] never made an enemy and was universally admired.\" His rival, England captain Archie MacLaren said \"I would give anything to play the game as keenly and yet as light-heartedly as Trott's lads did.\" He was \"imperturbable, good-humoured ... few Australian captains have been better liked and respected\".\n\n\n"}

Possible solutions are functions y(x) drawn as solid curves. Sometimes it is too cumbersome solving the differential equation analytically. Then one can still draw the tangents of the function curves e.g. on a regular grid. The tangents are touching the functions at the grid points. However, the direction field is rather agnostic about chaotic aspects of the differential equation.\n\nThe slope field can be defined for the following type of differential equations \nwhich can be interpreted geometrically as giving the slope of the tangent to the graph of the differential equation's solution (\"integral curve\") at each point (\"x\", \"y\") as a function of the point coordinates.\n\nIt can be viewed as a creative way to plot a real-valued function of two real variables formula_2 as a planar picture. Specifically, for a given pair formula_3, a vector with the components formula_4 is drawn at the point formula_3 on the formula_3-plane. Sometimes, the vector formula_4 is normalized to make the plot better looking for a human eye. A set of pairs formula_3 making a rectangular grid is typically used for the drawing.\n\nAn isocline (a series of lines with the same slope) is often used to supplement the slope field. In an equation of the form formula_1, the isocline is a line in the formula_3-plane obtained by setting formula_2 equal to a constant.\n\nGiven a system of differential equations,\nthe slope field is an array of slope marks in the phase space (in any number of dimensions depending on the number of relevant variables; for example, two in the case of a first-order linear ODE, as seen to the right). Each slope mark is centered at a point formula_16 and is parallel to the vector\n\nThe number, position, and length of the slope marks can be arbitrary. The positions are usually chosen such that the points formula_16 make a uniform grid. The standard case, described above, represents formula_19. The general case of the slope field for systems of differential equations is not easy to visualize for formula_20.\n\nWith computers, complicated slope fields can be quickly made without tedium, and so an only recently practical application is to use them merely to get the feel for what a solution should be before an explicit general solution is sought. Of course, computers can also just solve for one, if it exists.\n\nIf there is no explicit general solution, computers can use slope fields (even if they aren’t shown) to numerically find graphical solutions. Examples of such routines are Euler's method, or better, the Runge–Kutta methods.\n\nDifferent software packages can plot slope fields.\n\nfunn = @(x,y)y-x; % function f(x,y)=y-x\n[x,y]=meshgrid(-5:0.5:5); % intervals for x and y\nslopes=funn(x,y); % matrix of slope values\ndy=slopes./sqrt(1+slopes.^2); % normalize the line element...\ndx=ones(length(dy))./sqrt(1+slopes.^2); % ...magnitudes for dy and dx\nh=quiver(x,y,dx,dy,0.5); % plot the direction field\nset (h, \"maxheadsize\", 0.1); % alter head size\n\n /* field for y'=xy (click on a point to get an integral curve) */\n\nVectorPlot[{1,x*y},{x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]\n\nvar('x,y')\nplot_slope_field(x*y, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2))\n\n\n"}

Hezekiah Ochuka was the centre of the August 1, 1982 attempted coup, which the then president Daniel Arap Moi survived in less than a day. The 29-year-old was a Grade 1 – the second lowest rank in the military. Hezekiah was an unapologetic individual who assumed the title of chairman of a so-called \"People's Redemption Council\" that planned to replace President Moi. Hezekiah's military knowledge and connections made it manageable for him to form a military heist on the Kenyan Government. Hezekiah was not successful in his attempt to completely overthrow his homelands government; but he did manage to have control of the whole country of Kenya for six hours.\n\nOchuka, of the Luo Nation was born in Nyakach, Kisumu District. After attending Naki kabete Primary School and Mirogi Secondary School, Ochuka was recruited into the Kenya Air Force on September 14, 1976 in Mombasa. Hezekiah was raised by a single mother and his three older brothers. Being around a majority of men Hezekiah was always influenced by masculinity being that he was raised by his older brothers when a majority of the time the mother was working hard labor jobs to provide for the a family of four boys. He underwent eight weeks of military training at Lanet Army Barracks in Nakuru, and was posted to Eastleigh Air Base. Between 1976 and 1978, he underwent basic trade training in electrical devices and instruments, and worked in hangars and bays. From October 30, 1978 to January 21, 1980, he attended a course in RAF Cosford, UK, after which he worked as a Senior Private Grade-I, the second lowest rank in Kenya's military.\n\nOn August 1, 1982, Ochuka ruled Kenya for approximately 6 hours, after he led a group of low ranked Air Force servicemen in a coup d'état attempt. The country woke up in confusion as heavy gunfire filled the air. A group of rogue soldiers led by Ochuka had seized power at night after storming the National broadcaster V.O.K(now KBC) where they announced that they were now in charge of the country and were being fought by the loyal soldiers. They forced a group of Air Force fighter pilots to bomb the State House at gunpoint. The supposed \"trusted\" pilots pretended as if they were listening to orders given to them by their chief, but instead once in the air dropped bombs over Mount Kenya forests. President Moi later announced that loyal army and police units had crushed an attempted coup on his civilian government. The putsch was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff Mahamoud Mohamed, a veteran Somali military official. They included the General Service Unit (GSU) — a paramilitary wing of the police — and later the regular police. At least 9 civilians were killed and scores of casualties were reported at the three air force bases. Kenyan Hospitals reported that 50 civilians were treated for gunshot wounds. More than 300 air force personnel were later captured and detained but the colonel who led the coup (Ochuka) was still at large. Ochuka subsequently escaped to Tanzania. He was later extradited to Kenya along with a few more leading accomplices and found guilty in 1987.\n\n After Hezekiah was captured from Tanzania he was then to be taken back to his home of Kenya to be tried and was found guilty of all charges against him and his team of low ranked air force men. Ogidi (one of Hezekiah's coup accomplices) was told that next morning that Hezekiah and Raila had been shot by the Air Force by accident. For that reason Ogidi was told to pick them up, not sure which one of the two took the initiative to make the call for help. This call ended up being a setup just to capture Ogidi himself. The end came shortly thereafter. Ogidi left the Ngong Road house and drove towards town and on reaching the Grosvenor Hotel, he then found a road block mounted by army personnel under the command of a Navy officer. Ogidi and Opwapo were arrested. Ogidi was taken to Army headquarters and Opwapo was later brought as well. At the time of arrest, Ogidi had (a sub-machine gun) and 32 rounds of ammo which were all taken by the army. Later, Ogidi was transferred to Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. Ochuka was hanged after being convicted of treason following a court martial as well Ogidi.\n\n\n"}

An all-rounder who batted in the middle order and often opened the bowling with medium-paced off-spin, Giffen captained Australia during the 1894–95 Ashes series and was the first Australian to score 10,000 runs and take 500 wickets in first-class cricket. He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame on 26 February 2008.\n\nGiffen was born in the Adelaide neighbourhood of Norwood in 1859 to Richard Giffen, a carpenter and his wife Elizabeth (née Challand). He played cricket with enthusiasm as a boy and attracted the notice of two brothers, Charles and James Gooden, who coached him. He started his cricket career with Norwood Cricket Club, later moving to the West Adelaide club.\n\nEarly in 1877 he played for South Australia against a visiting East Melbourne team making 16 and 14, the highest score in each innings, but South Australian cricket was then much below the standard of the two eastern colonies. In November 1877 he made his first-class cricket debut against Tasmania. Giffen made 47 runs and took 4 wickets for 16 runs in the Tasmanian first innings. Tasmania was forced to follow-on (bat twice in a row) and in the second innings Giffen managed to capture another 2 wickets. It was not until November 1880 that the first regular match between South Australia and Victoria took place at Melbourne. Giffen made 3 and 63 and took two wickets for 47 in the first innings. In the follow-up match in Adelaide later that season, Giffen took 5 wickets for 59 runs (5/59); Victoria won the match by 151 runs. He became a regular member of the South Australian team and although he took a few seasons to develop his full powers, if he failed as a bat he usually made up for it with a good bowling performance.\n\nGiffen, only 22 years old, made his Test debut in Melbourne against England in 1881–82. Having just joined the postal service, Giffen was almost hesitant to ask for leave. Giffen made 30 runs before being bowled by Tom Emmett but was unable to take a wicket. Left out of the side for the Second Test in Sydney, he returned for the Third Test. Australia won the match by five wickets by Giffen made only two runs and was not given a chance to bowl. In the final Test of the series, Giffen captured his first Test wicket—William Scotton stumped by Jack Blackham for 27. He took 2/17 and, with the bat, made 14 in a drawn match. Australia won the series two Tests to nil.\n\nGiffen was selected to tour England with the Australian team in 1882. He was moderately successful, taking 32 wickets at an average of 21.84 and making 699 runs averaging 19.02. In the celebrated match against England—later designated a Test match—Giffen made 2 runs in the first innings but was dismissed by Ted Peate for a \"duck\" in the second. Australia, through a magnificent bowling effort from Fred Spofforth and Harry Boyle, won the match by seven runs. The match was the origin of the term \"The Ashes\" for Test series between the two nations. A mock obituary placed in \"The Sporting Times\" lamented \"the death of English cricket\" and noted that \"The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\"\n\nIvo Bligh and his English team arrived in Australia in 1882–83 determined to win back \"the Ashes\". In the First Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Giffen made 36 runs, his highest Test score to date. He followed this with his best figures with the ball, capturing 4/38 in the England second innings, helping Australia to a nine wicket victory. In the Second Test, Giffen made a \"golden duck\", dismissed first ball without scoring but took 4/89 in England's only innings; the English won the Test by an innings and 27 runs. Giffen was promoted to open the batting for the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where he made 41 and 7 England won the Test by 69 runs, winning the first \"Ashes\" series 2–1.\n\nIn February 1884, Giffen became the first Australian to take all ten wickets in a first-class innings, taking 10/66 for an Australian XI against the Rest. Later that year, he was once again included in the Australian team to tour England, led by Billy Murdoch. The Australians lost the three Test series one Test to nil, but had the best of the two drawn matches. In the Second Test at Lord's, Giffen top-scored in the first innings, making 63 runs;. England won the Test by an innings and 5 runs. Giffen took 81 wickets in England at an average of 19.60, however he \"tended to be expensive\". His best batting performance for the tour was 118 against Lancashire; a match in which he also took a \"hat-trick\".\n\nAn English team led by Alfred Shaw toured Australia in 1884–85 to contest the \"Ashes\". England won the First Test by eight wickets but the match was overshadowed by a dispute between the teams; the Australian team wished a larger share of the match profits. As a result, most of the Australian team, including Giffen, made themselves unavailable for the next two Tests. This action was unpopular with the Australian public. Charles Kingston, then South Australian Attorney-General, said \"the Australian eleven would have the reputation of having sacrificed the cricketing honour of their nation to monetary considerations\". Giffen and the others returned for the Fourth Test in Sydney where Australia won by eight wickets; Giffen taking 7/117 in the England first innings. England won the Fifth Test by an innings and 98 runs, retaining the Ashes in a 3–2 series victory.\n\nGiffen, in a sign of things to come, made a remarkable double for South Australia against Victoria in March 1886. He captured 17 wickets for the match—including 9/91 in the first innings—and made over 100 runs. Five years later, against Victoria in November 1891, he repeated the feat even more impressively, scoring 271 runs in South Australia's innings and taking 9/96 and 7/70 in Victoria's two innings.\n\nThe Australian team touring England in 1886 did not meet with much success, losing all three Tests. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" remarked that \"there is nothing to place the [Australians] on any higher standard than would have been attained by any good county team that went playing about the country\". Giffen made only 60 runs for in the Tests and took only four wickets. In the other matches, however, Giffen was more successful. He made 1424 runs for the tour—only Sammy Jones scored more for the Australians—and took 154 wickets, including five wickets in an innings no less than 13 times. George Giffen set the record for becoming the first player to complete the double of scoring 1000 runs and 100 wickets in Test history\n\nHis first class performances include many achievements. Nine times he scored a century and took 10 wickets in the one match. Twice he scored a century and took more than a dozen wickets. No other cricketer in the world has ever done it. He is the only bowler in the world to snare 16 wickets in a match five times. He was the first to take 17. When he was 24 he became the first bowler outside England to get a whole side out with 10–66.\n\nHe is the first Test cricketer to score 1000 runs and take 100 Test wickets. He is also the first Australian to take 1000 first-class wickets and score 10000 runs.\n\nGiffen's best figures were 271 runs and 16 wickets (9/96 and 7/70) for the match for South Australia vs. Victoria in 1891. In all he scored 18 first-class centuries, 4 of them doubles.\n\nGiffen also performed well in English conditions. On each of his five tours he topped both the batting and bowling overall tour averages, yet another unique Giffen feat. The great all rounder led Australia in four of the five Tests during 1894 tour. His 34 Test wickets was a series record at that time and he also scored the most runs for that series. Giffen played his last Test in 1896 but remained a force at the first-class level for some time, at the age of 41 he captured 13 English wickets to steer South Australia to a victory over the tourists. Three years later he finished his career with scores of 81, 97 not out and 15 wickets (7/75 and 8/110) against Victoria. \nGiffen was a robust batsman noted for his driving he also had a fine cut and glance. A slow to medium pace bowler he was brilliant with his deceptive off spin and the master in flight and changes of pace which he took many wickets.\n\nGeorge though has often been accused of more than a sprinkling of nepotism, using his influence to try to help his brother Walter Giffen. Walter played Test cricket for Australia despite below average performances for South Australia and when George was named Captain of the 1894 tour Walter having made 11 runs in his three Tests to date and a poor domestic season was also named, many believing because of George's influence over the selection. He has also been accused of causing the demise of cricketer Charlie Turner who was the country's leading wicket taker at the time, and then, in the following test which Australia needed to win, opening the bowling with himself.\n\nGeorge Giffen has a grandstand at the Adelaide Oval named after him. He died in Parkside, South Australia. In 2008 he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame\n\nGiffen also played Australian rules football at a high level, representing the Norwood Football Club for whom he is credited as kicking their first ever goal in the South Australian Football Association. \"He would cap brilliant runs that paralysed all opposition with superb kicks, turning in a moment the whole tide of play.\", an observer at the time said.\n\nHe wrote an autobiography entitled \"With Bat and Ball\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866695", "title": "Bernard Revel", "text": "Bernard Revel\n\nBernard (Dov) Revel (; September 17, 1885 – December 2, 1940) was an Orthodox rabbi and scholar. He served as the first President of Yeshiva College from 1915 until his death in 1940. The Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University, as well as the former Yeshiva Dov Revel of Forest Hills, are named for him.\n\nRevel was born in Prieni (today: Prienai), a neighboring town of Kovno (today: Kaunas) Lithuania, then part of Russia, a son of the community's Rabbi Nachum Shraga Revel. His father was his first teacher, and when Nachum Revel died in 1896 he was buried next to his close friend Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor - indicative of his knowledge and stature.\n\nHe briefly studied in Telz yeshiva, attending the lectures of its Rosh yeshiva Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch. He was also taught by the renowned Rabbi Yitzchok Blazer and learned in the Kovno kollel. Revel received semicha at the age of 16, but it is not known from whom. Thereafter, the young scholar earned a Russian high school diploma, apparently through independent study. He also became involved in the Russian revolutionary movement, and following the unsuccessful revolution of 1905, was arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release the following year, he emigrated to the United States.\n\nImmediately after his arrival, Revel enrolled in New York's RIETS yeshiva. He received a master of arts degree from New York University in 1909. Around this time, one of America's senior rabbis and president of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis, Rabbi Bernard Levinthal of Philadelphia, visited the yeshiva and, after discussing Talmudic topics with the new student, invited him to come to Philadelphia as the rabbi's secretary and assistant. Revel accepted the post and began to familiarise himself with the alien milieu of American Jewry. At the same time, he began attending law school in Philadelphia, but eventually decided that the law was not his calling. In 1911, he earned a doctorate of philosophy from Dropsie College, the first graduate of that school; his thesis was entitled \"The Karaite Halakhah and Its Relation to Sadducean, Samaritan, and Philonian Halakhah\".\n\nIn November 1908, Revel was introduced to his future wife, Sarah Travis of Marietta, Ohio, whom he married in 1909. The members of the Travis family were wealthy Oklahoma oil-men, and Rabbi Revel moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma to join the family business after finishing his doctorate. However, even while serving as an assistant to his brother-in-law Solomon in the petroleum business, and amassing his own fortune, Rabbi Revel's primary occupation continued to be his Torah study.\n\nIn 1915, Harry Fischel, on the Board of Directors of the newly merged RIETS, asked Revel to come back East and head the institution. In him, Mr. Fischel saw a learned and forward thinking educator to lead the yeshiva on the path of becoming a college. Rabbi Revel took up the position and was appointed RIET's first president and Rosh yeshiva.\n\nRevel's writings and students were most important to him. However, Revel never abandoned the role of scholar to become solely an administrator, though he was known by his students as one. His research illustrates a unique usage of pilpulistic and Talmudic investigation. It was his new halakhic-historic approach, of quoting even non-rabbinic sources, such as Josephus and Philo, for context that set him apart.\n\nBesides for his research, Revel channeled his intellect towards strengthening the foundation of Jewish Orthodoxy in America. He was most concerned with problems of maintaining traditional observance in the modern setting. He sought to build up an educational system for American Jewry where they would not feel alienated. In his speeches, Revel rarely, if ever, used difficult Torah language. Instead, he used very simple terms that were readily understandable. At a speech for the Rabbinic Council of America (RCA) Revel praised “the light of human reason”, and declared “the ascending spirit of mankind will triumph.”\n\nRevel consistently maintained that secular knowledge in Judaism was never separate from the study of Torah. He emphasized the importance of unifying Judaism and secular studies. Often speaking of the, “harmonious union of culture and spirituality,” he believed that knowledge of the liberal arts would broaden one’s understanding of Torah. However, Revel's dedication to Orthodox Jewry was undisputed. For instance, he forbade the use of a female vocalist in the 1926 Music Festival, as a female singer is a violation of Orthodox Jewish law. He did not allow Reform Jews to serve on Yeshiva College’s national board of directors. He was also staunchly opposed to mixed seating in synagogues.\n\nHe wrote: \"Yeshiva aims at unity, at the creation of a synthesis between the Jewish conception of life, our spiritual and moral teaching and ideals, and the present-day humanities, the scientific conscience and spirit to help develop the complete harmonious Jewish personality, once again to enrich and bless our lives, to revitalize the true spirit and genius of historic Judaism.\"\n\nOne of Revel’s main reasons for founding RIETS and Yeshiva College was, “so that these men may not be lost to us [through assimilation].” Revel wanted Yeshiva to become a place where American Jews could feel comfortable, take pride in their religion, and not be restricted by anti-Semitic sentiments. Revel also added Bible, Hebrew, and Jewish History to the curriculum in Yeshiva College. He did this for several reasons, although one of them was to outdo Jewish Theological Seminary, a non-orthodox institution, which did not have Bible studies at the time. Although Revel viewed the liberal arts as a way to educate and integrate Jews with Torah values, he perceived the sciences as too “mechanistic” and “soulless” to be useful in integrating Judaism with secular culture.\n\nRevel's primary scientific scholarly interest was Karaism. His constant study and research in this area developed from his Dropsie College doctoral dissertation, The Karaite Halakhah and its Relation to Sadducean, Samaritan, and Philonian Halakhah (1912). Earlier scholars like Simha Pinksker had aimed to show that Karaites \"were the source of all intellectual achievement of medieval Judaism.\" According to this school of thought, the Massorah, with its beginnings of grammatical and biblical exegesis, belongs to the Karaites; the Rabbanites were merely imitators. This notion was challenged by Revel.\n\nRevel was interested in the origin of Karaism, its causes and early development. He maintained that the question of the origin of Karaism is bound up with the problem of the origin of the Karaite halakha, which is of vital importance for understanding the history of Tradition. Revel essentially traced the individual Karaite laws to their respective sources.\n\nRevel was a presidium member of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis from 1924, later being appointed its honorary president, and authored many articles on Jewish subjects in various Hebrew periodicals such as the Jewish Quarterly Review, \"Yagdil Torah\", \"Ha-Pardes\", and various Yeshiva student publications. He started writing a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud in Philadelphia, but this was never published. He was an associate editor of \"Otzar Yisrael\", the Hebrew Encyclopedia. In 1935 he became the first vice president of the Jewish Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 1986, he appeared on a $1 U.S. Postage stamp, as part of the Great Americans Series. U.S. engraver Kenneth Kipperman, who designed the stamp, was suspended for including a tiny Star of David, invisible to the naked eye, in Revel's beard.\n\n"}

The rokosz, formed on 5 August 1606 by Mikołaj Zebrzydowski, Jan Szczęsny Herburt, Stanisław Stadnicki, Aleksander Józef Lisowski and Janusz Radziwiłł in Stężyca and Lublin, was caused by the growing dissatisfaction with the King among the nobility (the \"szlachta\"). In particular, the rebels disapproved of the King's efforts to limit the power of the nobles, his attempts to weaken the \"Sejm\" (the Polish parliament) and to introduce a hereditary monarchy in place of the elective one. The rebellion (1606–1608) ended in the defeat of the rebels. Despite the failure to overthrow the King, the rebellion firmly established the dominance of the \"szlachta\" over the monarch in the Polish–Lithuanian political system.\n\nThe Polish nobles gathered at the \"rokosz\" formed a \"konfederacja\" and outlined their demands in 67 articles. They demanded Sigismund III's dethronement for breaching the Henrician Articles, and the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. They further demanded that the Sejm appoint state officials instead of the king; that local officials should be elected and not appointed and that Protestant's rights should be expanded and protected.\n\nThe 1607 Sejm rejected the demands. Meanwhile, the rebel nobles gathered in Guzów. In 1607 the Royal Army, led by Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz was sent to pacify the rebels. A full scale battle ensued on July 5/July 6 (sources vary), with 200 casualties, which resulted in the victory of the Royalist forces.\nBy 1609, the rebellion was over. Two years after the start of the revolt, the rebellious nobles formally surrendered to the king at the 1609 meeting of the Sejm, which became known as the Pacification Sejm. In return for their surrender the rebels were granted leniency. Many royal supporters, including Hetman Chodkiewicz, had successfully argued for amnesty for the rebels.\n\nDespite the failure of the rebellion, it nevertheless ruined any chance that Sigismund III had to strengthen his role in the government. Polish historian Oskar Halecki wrote:\n\nAfter the rebellion, King Sigismund attempted to funnel the nobles' restless energy into external wars. This, combined with other factors, led to the official Commonwealth involvement in the Polish-Muscovite War (1609–18), which followed the Dimitriads (1605–09).\n\n\n"}

After his 1946 discharge from the World War II US Navy, Kozlow spent two years painting and working in New York City. Although his work had achieved some success (and a favorable \"New York Times\" mention), he returned to Detroit to marry the love of his life and \"get a job\".\n\nAt this time (as throughout his career), his paintings used materials in new ways, delving into the textures of old walls and peeling posters. He won (among others) the Museum Purchase prizes of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Butler Art Institute.\n\nDespite a successful Detroit advertising career, winning creative awards and large salaries, in 1960 he left it all to live and paint in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Here he applied the new techniques he'd developed to creating the first of the misty mountain paintings which earned his international reputation.\n\nThus began the pattern of the rest of Richard Kozlow's life.

{"id": "1866714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866714", "title": "Tom Horan", "text": "Tom Horan\n\nThomas Patrick Horan (8 March 1854 – 16 April 1916) was an Australian cricketer who played for Victoria and Australia, and later became an esteemed cricket journalist under the pen name \"Felix\". The first of only two players born in Ireland to play Test cricket for Australia, Horan was the leading batsman in the colony of Victoria during the pioneering years of international cricket. He played for Australia in the game against England subsequently designated as the first Test match, before touring England with the first representative Australian team, in 1878. Four years later, he toured England for the second time and played in the famed Ashes Test match at The Oval.\n\nAn aggressive middle-order batsman renowned for his leg-side play, Horan supplemented his batting by bowling medium-pace in the roundarm style common to his era, and once captured six wickets in a Test match innings. During a season disrupted by financial disputes and a strike by leading players, he captained Australia in two Test matches of the 1884–85 Ashes series, but lost both games. Horan's form peaked between the ages of 26 and 29 when he scored seven of his eight first-class centuries, including a score of 124 in a Test match on his home ground at Melbourne in January 1882.\n\nIn 1879, Horan began writing a weekly newspaper column that continued until his death 37 years later. He established himself as the first Australian cricket writer who had played the game at the highest level, thus paving the way for many players to enter the media. Bill O'Reilly, the noted Australian player-writer of the twentieth century, described him as, \"the cricket writer \"par excellence\"\". Horan's documentation of the early years of Australian cricket are the basis for many works on the subject: Gideon Haigh wrote that any, \"serious scholar in the field ... should probably acquaint himself with Tom Horan.\" An anthology of his articles was published for the first time in 1989 when he was posthumously inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame for his writing. In part, his citation read, \"... it was as the first nationally known cricket writer that he made his major contribution to the game.\"\n\nBorn in the town of Midleton near the Irish city of Cork, Horan emigrated to Australia with his parents and siblings as a small child. In Melbourne, he attended Bell Street School in Fitzroy and formed a friendship with Jack Blackham; Blackham encouraged in Horan a love of cricket. Horan made his first-class debut for Victoria in the season of 1874/75.\n\nAt age 23, Tom Horan was selected to play in the first Test between Australia and England in March 1877. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. After the fall of the first wicket, that of Nat Thomson, Horan made his way to the wicket. At 23 years 7 days old he was the youngest Test Cricketer at that time. He passed George Ulyett, the England No: 4, who was 2 years 138 days older than Tom Horan. When Jack Blackham, the Australia No: 8 Batsman, came out to bat Tom Horan dropped to 2nd youngest as Jack Blackham was 64 days younger. With Charles Bannerman (who would eventually retire hurt on 165), Horan put on 38 runs for the second wicket before he was dismissed for 12. In the second innings, the young batsman made twenty, the highest score in Australia's 104 all out. Australia won the historic match by 45 runs.\n\nAlthough he was not selected to play in Second Test of the inaugural Test series, Horan did enjoy a regular place in the Australian Test team into the mid-1880s. His highest Test score of 124 was made in the First Test of the 1881/82 season against England. Horan toured England twice, in 1878 and 1882, but played only one Test in that country, at the Oval in 1882.\nIn 1884, the Australian Test team – minus Horan – demanded a significant pay rise. When organisers refused the request, the team went on strike. With the Second Test against England due to start in Melbourne, selectors were forced to choose an entirely new team. Horan was selected as captain. His team consisted on nine debutants (five of whom never played Tests again). Australia lost the Test by 10 wickets. In the following Test, Horan, having been stripped of his captaincy duties, made a significant impact with the ball, returning figures of 6/40 from 37.1 four-ball overs in England's first innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Horan played his final Test on 21 March 1885. He scored a duck in the first innings and made 20 in the second before being bowled by William Attewell, and bowled three wicketless overs for five runs as England took an innings victory.\n\nHe turned his attention to journalism, writing a regular cricket column for \"The Australasian\", a weekly published by Melbourne's \"Argus\" newspaper. Haigh writes that Horan \"was not an adventurous stylist: he wrote, instead, with his ears and eyes, with a sense of the telling remark and the evocative detail.\" He never attached his own name to his writings, preferring to use the pseudonym \"Felix\". Horan continued contributing to \"The Australasian\" until his death in 1916.\n\nIn 1879, Horan married Kate Pennefather, the daughter of a Melbourne police officer. They had nine children. Two of Horan's sons played first-class cricket for Victoria in the early 1900s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1866729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866729", "title": "Tup Scott", "text": "Tup Scott\n\nHenry James Herbert \"Tup\" Scott (26 December 1858 – 23 September 1910) was an Australian cricketer who played first-class cricket for Victoria and Test cricket for Australia. He acquired his nickname during a cricket tour of England in 1884 from his love of London sightseeing tours which cost two pence or \"tuppence\".\n\nScott was born in Toorak, Victoria, and soon moved to Melbourne, where he began to play cricket at a high level. He made his first-class debut in February 1878, and was soon chosen for the Australian team. By the time of the 1886 Australian tour of England, he had been appointed captain, but he remained in England at the tour's conclusion to pursue a career in medicine, and played no further first-class cricket. Scott began as a right arm fast-medium bowler and achieved his best analysis of six wickets for 33 runs on his first-class debut. But it was as a middle order batsman that Scott developed into an international player. He scored four first-class centuries, including one for Australia when he scored 102 at The Oval in 1884. Scott assumed the leadership of the Australian team following a dispute between English and Australian authorities which resulted in the dropping of Billy Murdoch, the Australian captain. However, the team which he led was afflicted by internal disputes over which he could exert no authority, and the tour was unsuccessful.\n\nScott returned to Australia as a qualified medical practitioner. He retired from cricket and set up a practice in the rural New South Wales town of Scone, where he later served as mayor and chief magistrate. He died at Scone of typhoid in 1910.\n\nScott was born at Toorak, Victoria on 26 December 1858 to John and Elizabeth Scott. His father was secretary of the Melbourne Gas and Coke Company. Scott was educated at Wesley College and the University of Melbourne, from which he and two of his brothers graduated in medicine.\n\nScott was spotted by Sam Cosstick, an influential figure in Victorian cricket, when playing for his college aged thirteen; Cosstick remarked: \"That little nipper will make a good 'un!\" Scott played successfully for St Kilda Cricket Club as a schoolboy. Fully grown, Scott was 5 ft 9 in (175 cm) tall and weighed 11 st 8 lb (73.6 kg).\n\nScott's obituary in \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" said that \"in his young days he was a fast bowler, but his reputation as a cricketer was gained entirely as a batsman\". Scott made his first-class debut at the age of nineteen in February 1878 when he played for Victoria against New South Wales at the Association Ground in Sydney. He scored just 2 and 0 but distinguished himself as a fast-medium bowler in the New South Wales second innings by taking a career-best six for 33. His next match for the colony was not until March 1882 when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. South Australia won by 31 runs. Scott, who opened Victoria's first innings, scored 9 and 10.\n\n\"Wisden\" recorded that Scott's potential was first noticed in 1882 and he became a Victorian regular in the 1882–83 season. In the opening match of the 1883–84 season, Scott scored 114 not out against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and \"Wisden\" said this innings \"was the main cause of his being given a place in the Australian team that came to England in 1884\".\n\nScott had a very successful tour in 1884 with Australian team, under the captaincy of Billy Murdoch. In its summary of the tour, \"Wisden\" said: \"Scott (who had not visited England before) proved an emphatic success\". Scott made only 12 in the First Test at Old Trafford but achieved large scores in the other two. In the Second Test at Lord's, he scored 75 and 31 not out. \"Wisden\" recorded that \"Scott once more proved how well he merited a place in the team. He was admirably supported by Boyle, and before parting was effected 69 runs were put on for the last wicket. Scott played cool, confident, skilful cricket.\". Commenting on Australia's second innings, \"Wisden\" said: \"On the last day Scott made a gallant effort to save the innings defeat, but without avail. He was highest scorer in both innings of the Australians, and his total of 105 for once out was a very fine performance\". When caught for 75 in the first innings, he became the first player to be dismissed by a substitute; the catcher was his own captain, Murdoch, who was fielding as a substitute for England.\n\nScott scored 102 in the Third Test at The Oval. \"Wisden\" stated: \"Scott was batting three hours and a half for his 102, out of 207 put on while he was in\". His partnership of 207 with Murdoch for the third wicket was the first time a partnership of 200 had been achieved in a Test.\n\nAmong his other successes on the tour, Scott scored 82 not out against the Gentlemen at Lord's, 79 against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground and 65 in the second match against Gloucestershire at College Ground, Cheltenham. He appeared in 31 first-class matches on the tour, scoring 966 runs in 50 innings at an average of 23.00 with the one century and six half-centuries. He held 24 catches and took 3 wickets. During the tour, Scott acquired his nickname \"Tup\" through his love of London open-topped bus rides, each of which cost two pence, or \"tuppence\".\n\nHaving returned to Melbourne in November 1884, Scott became embroiled in a dispute between the Australian team and a touring English team formed by James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. On 1 November, while the returning Australian team was still at sea, the Australian newspaper \"The Age\" reported that the English tourists \"are not desirous of playing any matches in Australia against Murdoch's Eleven\". When the English team played Victoria later in the month, Scott was one of seven Victorians, all members of Murdoch's team, who refused to take part. Consequently, the Victorian Cricket Association suspended the players pending an inquiry. When the English team travelled to Sydney, the New South Wales contingent of Murdoch's team also refused to play. It was not until 27 December that details of the dispute became generally known when \"The Age\" published correspondence between Lillywhite and the Australians' manager George Alexander which revealed a disagreement about the share of the gate money from the first two Tests to be played in January and February. Members of the 1884 Australian team, including Scott, made up the entire home side in the First Test but boycotted the second match, forcing Australia replace the entire team. On 17 January 1885, \"The Australasian\" published an account written by Scott, Joey Palmer, Harry Boyle and Jack Blackham of alleged \"underhand dealings\" by John Conway who was representing the English team's interests.\n\nIn late February, Scott played in the third Test. Australia won by six runs but Scott failed. He was not selected for either of the two remaining Tests and played no further first-class cricket that season.\n\nBefore the 1885–86 season began, the Melbourne Cricket Club announced that it was to send an Australian team to England in 1886. It was the first time the club had formed a touring party and the historian Chris Harte says it did so largely on the advice of Lord Harris, who convinced them a team with official club backing would be \"far better received in England\". At a meeting of the Melbourne Cricket Club on 12 December 1885, it was announced that thirteen players including Tup Scott had agreed to form \"the strongest all-round team available in the colonies\".\n\nScott played three first-class matches in the 1885–86 season. He began with 111 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Victoria against New South Wales, which helped his team win by an innings and 69 runs. His good form continued with 74 for an Australian team against his home colony, the tourists winning by 10 wickets. But in the final match, playing for Victoria against New South Wales at the Association Ground, he was dismissed for 16 and 0 as his team lost by 150 runs. While playing cricket that season, Scott completed the third year of his medical course at Melbourne University.\n\nThe Melbourne Club was aware that, in the aftermath of the 1884–85 dispute, there were proposals in England to ban certain Australian players. The club decided to omit former captain Murdoch, Bannerman and Percy McDonnell from the team. This move caused widespread criticism, especially as Boyle, Tom Horan and Hugh Massie had already declared themselves unavailable. Scott, now aged 27, was chosen as captain. In \"Wisden's\" view: \"It was a misfortune for Scott  ... Under happier circumstances he might have got on well, but fortune was against him\". Harte comments that it was Scott's \"misfortune in a way to be following the blazing success of Murdoch's captaincy with a team that looked good on paper but was, in fact, growing jaded\".\n\nThe tour was a great disappointment for Australian cricket. The team won only nine of its 39 matches and were soundly beaten in the Test series, but the real difficulty was the indiscipline of some players. According to \"Wisden\", quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and Scott had \"neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded\". Scott and the team manager Ben Wardill spent a lot of time adjudicating quarrels and the stress of the captaincy impacted Scott's performances as a batsman. The 1887 edition of \"Wisden\" bemoaned the absence of Murdoch, saying: \"W. L. Murdoch, who was chief in the field of the three teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884, may not have exhibited all the qualities which go to make up that rare and valuable being, an ideal captain – but he certainly had a larger experience and a stronger will than the gentleman who, with the best of intentions, and the greatest sincerity of purpose, led the team of 1886\".\nEngland won the First Test at Old Trafford by four wickets. \"Wisden\" called it a \"remarkable match\" and described Scott's innings of 47 in the second innings as \"capital batting\". This was the closest Australia came to beating England in the series and \"Wisden\" said \"they made a splendid fight of it\". In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia had two low totals and were well beaten, \"Wisden\" remarking that \"the Australians thus suffered a most crushing and decisive defeat by an innings and 106 runs\". \"Wisden\" commented on the poor form of the Australians in the third Test which meant \"England was left with another decisive victory, by an innings and 217 runs\". W. G. Grace made his highest Test score of 170 after he was dropped by Scott when he had scored only six runs. Scott made only 110 runs in his six Test innings at 18.33 including his highest score of 47 at Old Trafford. But Australia's batting was poor with only one half-century scored for the team in the series.\n\nScott played some good innings and totalled 1,278 runs on the tour at an average of 22.03 with a best score of 123 against Middlesex at Lord's. In an innings of 67 not out against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield he scored 22 runs in one four-ball over from Saul Wade, which is still the record for the most runs scored of a four-ball over in first-class cricket history.\n\nAt the end of the tour, Scott decided to remain in England to complete his qualification as a medical practitioner. On his return to Australia, he went into medical practice and retired from cricket. Years later, Scott was asked if he would have liked to continue playing and he replied: \"I have captained Australia and hit a Test century. Many would have liked two such honours as these\". Scott made 85 first-class appearances of which only 17 were in Australia; he played 68 times on his two tours of England.\n\nThe cricket writer Ray Robinson suggests that Scott's batting \"was noted for grit rather than gaiety\" but he did sometimes reveal an adventurous streak as shown when he landed a ball from A. G. Steel onto the pavilion roof at The Oval and by his assault on Saul Wade's bowling at Bramall Lane. In 1884, England found that Scott was the hardest man to bowl out in the Australian team.\n\nScott began his medical career in June 1888 as a surgeon at the mines in the East Australian Cordillera. In July, he married Mary Minnie Mickle at St Kilda, Victoria and they eventually settled at Scone, New South Wales; Robinson wrote that Scott \"undertook the life of a pioneer country doctor with a spirit service that won him even greater esteem than (his) Test deeds\". Scott is said to have dealt with unpaid accounts by ruling them out of his books. He was elected mayor of Scone and held office for three years, also serving as the town's chief magistrate.\n\nOn 23 September 1910, Tup Scott died of typhoid. When a new hospital opened in Scone, the townspeople named it the Scott Memorial Hospital.\n\n"}

He is famous for an armed rebellion against King Sigismund III Vasa, the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, a \"rokosz\" named after himself. It took place in 1606, and was defeated by 1607. After the failed rebellion, he sponsored the creation of the Roman Catholic monastery of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska, which is regarded as one of the most important pilgrimage sites of Poland.\n\nMikołaj Zebrzydowski is one of the personas on the famous painting by Jan Matejko: \"Skarga's Sermon\".\n\nZebrzydowski was born in 1553 in Kraków, into a family which became powerful and influential in the second half of the 16th century. His grandfather Jan Zebrzydowski (died probably 1538) was a royal rotmistrz. His father Florian, who died in 1566, was a castellan of Oświęcim and Lublin, and a court hetman. Florian Zebrzydowski authored a book on military discipline, titled \"Poruczenie wojenne\". Mikołaj's mother, Zofia (née Dzik), came from a petty szlachta family. Mikołaj was their only known child. From 1565 to 1569 he attended a jesuit collegium at Braniewo. He took part in wars of Stefan Batory against Gdańsk (1577), and against the Tsardom of Russia. In the Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, Mikołaj Zebrzydowski was the rittmeister of a 150-strong hussar regiment. He fought in several battles in that conflict, after which in 1582 returned to Poland. Probably due to protection of Jan Zamoyski, he was nominated the starosta of Stężyca, and in 1585, was named the starosta of Kraków. In 1583 he married Zofia (née Herburt), with whom he had two kids, son Jan Zebrzydowski (husband of Barbara Lubomirska), and daughter Zofia. His wife died in 1610.\n\nDuring the 1587 free royal election, he supported Sigismund Vasa, and financially supported Vasa's faction in the War of the Polish Succession (1587–88). After the conflict, he was named Voivode of Lublin and court hetman. In 1595, Zebrzydowski participated in Jan Zamoyski's raid to Moldova, and in 1601, was promoted to the title of Voivode of Kraków. In ca. 1605, he became dissatisfied with King Zygmunt's attempts to strengthen royal power and weaken the nobility. The King tried to reform the administration and the treasury, also to create a permanent army. Zebrzydowski opposed it, as in his opinion, royal plans were a threat to the so-called Golden Liberty. \n\nAn opposition to the king have led to a \"rokosz\" during 1606-1608, with Zebrzydowski among its leaders.\n\nZebrzydowski first voiced his opposition during a Kraków Voivodeship sejmik in Proszowice (16 February 1606). He stated that in order to restrain the King and control the Sejm, the nobility had to gather near Warsaw, adding that the \"homeland\" was in danger. His speech was warmly welcomed, and on 23 February, the sejmik of Lesser Poland, which took place in Nowy Korczyn, rejected royal plans, urging the Polish–Lithuanian nobility to concentrate at Stężyca, on 9 April.\n\nSince the rebellious nobility, gathered at Stężyca, had no idea how to fight the King, another meeting was called in Lublin, on 5 June. There, the nobility called a meeting at Sandomierz (6 August), while royal supporters gathered in nearby Wiślica. Both camps wrote lists of their demands, called the \"Wiślica Bills\" and the \"Sandomierz Bills\". After King's rejection of the \"Sandomierz Bills\", the rebels called for a pospolite ruszenie, and the two camps faced each other at Janowiec, where leaders of the rebellion, Mikołaj Zebrzydowski and Janusz Radziwiłł, apologized to the King (8 October 1606).\n\nThe rebellion, however, did not end, as news of it reached Greater Poland. On 14 February 1607, local nobility gathered at a sejmik in Koło urged their Lesser Polish brethren to complete the rebellion, and to meet on 28 March in Jędrzejów. By that time, however, the rokosz lost its momentum, and the rebel camp was first moved to Wąchock, then to Sieciechów, and finally to Czersk. On 24 June 1607, near Jeziorna (), the rebels renounced their allegiance to the King. On 5 July 1607 they were defeated in the Battle of Guzów, which ended the \"rokosz\". Zebrzydowski himself made his peace with the King on 24 August 1608 in Kraków.\n\nAfter the rebellion, Zebrzydowski continued to participate in political life of Poland. He did not fight in the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18), instead sending a few hundred of soldiers to guard the Transilvanian border against the possible invasion of Gabriel Bathory. He also appeared at the Sejms in 1613 and 1615, publicly supporting the King. After his death in 1620, he was buried in a Benedictine habit.\n\n\n\n"}

Lord of the castle in Łańcut. Enemy of Jan Zamoyski, Grand Chancellor of the Crown in 1606 he became one of the leaders of the rokosz of Zebrzydowski. From his Łańcut castle he organised many assaults (zajazdy) at the estates of Łukasz Opaliński and Anna Ostrogska.\n\nMarried to Anna Stadnicka, father of Zygmunt Stadnicki, Władysław Stadnicki, Stanisław Stadnicki (junior) and Felicjana Stadnicka. After his death, his family carried his tradition of trouble-making, with his wife earning the nickname of \"the Łańcut devil-woman\" and his sons, \"the Łancut devil-children\".\n\nHe was killed on 20 August 1610, when he was confronted with an overwhelming force loyal to Łukasz Opaliński, and didn't manage to evade pursuit to return to his own men.\n\nHe was the son of and Barbara née Zborowski, a Calvinist . His brother was h.

The Stadnicki family was Evangelical-Reformed (Calvinist) and held a church in Łańcut.\n\nHe is remembered as an adventurer and a famous brawler, called the \"Devil of Łańcut\". He earned this notoriety as captain taking part in Stefan Batory 's expedition to Gdańsk and Moscow . Offended that his exploits were underestimated, he left for Hungary, where in the army of Emperor Rudolf II he fought against the Turks . Later he supported Archduke Maximilian in his efforts to obtain the Polish crown and for some time stayed in Silesia where he met his future wife Anna Ziemięcka while staying with her father. He took part on the Austrian side in the siege of the Olsztyn castle near Częstochowa.\n\nIn 1586, he took over the city of Łańcut for debts from Anna Sienińska . During the election of 1587 he voted from the Krakow Province for Maksymilian Habsburg.\n\nAs a Protestant, and allowance for the Crown Tribunal in Lublin he was chosen by prowizorem Protestant-Orthodox confederation of Vilnius in 1599 year.

{"id": "1866742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866742", "title": "Jack Blackham", "text": "Jack Blackham\n\nJohn McCarthy Blackham (11 May 1854 – 28 December 1932) was a Test cricketer who played for Victoria and Australia.\n\nA specialist wicket-keeper, Blackham played in the first Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 1877 and the famous Ashes Test match of 1882. Such was his skill in the position that he revolutionised the art of wicket-keeping and was known as the \"prince of wicket-keepers\". Late in his career, he captained the Australian team.\n\nBlackham was born in the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North, the son of newsagent Frederick Kane Blackham and his wife Lucinda (née McCarthy). Blackham became a bank clerk, and held a position in the Colonial Bank of Australasia for many years. It is said that his thick dark beard, perceived then as a sign of an equable and reliable nature, reassured his customers. His brother-in-law was George Eugene \"Joey\" Palmer.\n\nBlackham was included in the first eleven of the Carlton Cricket Club as a batsman at the age of sixteen. He first appeared for the Victorian team in 1874, and remained an automatic selection as the team's wicket-keeper for over twenty years. He was a member of the first eight Australian cricket teams to visit England.\n\nHe was one of the first wicket-keepers to stand up close to the stumps, even to the fastest bowlers, wearing gloves that Jack Pollard describes as \"little more than gardening gloves\". He eliminated the need for a long-stop, and Pollard says that \"... in England on one of his trips there a group of clergymen complained that he was a danger to the wellbeing of cricket, encouraging as he did the abolition of long-stop, the clergy's traditional fielding spot in village teams.\"\n\nBlackham was selected for the very first Test match, held at Melbourne in March 1876/77. Australia's leading bowler Fred Spofforth refused to play in the match, because Blackham was preferred to Spofforth's New South Wales teammate Billy Murdoch. In the Test match, Blackham took three catches and made the first Test-Match stumping, when he dismissed Alfred Shaw off the bowling of Tom Kendall in England's second innings. In 1878, he represented his country for the first time overseas, as a member of the inaugural Australian cricket team to tour England and North America.\n\nDescribed by teammates as the \"prince of wicket-keepers\" and one of Australia's first cricketing heroes, \"Black Jack\" Blackham (nicknamed for his dark beard) was Australia's regular wicket-keeper from 1877 to 1894.\n\nJack Blackham spent most of the 1st day of the 1st Test Match in the Home Dressing Room as he was batting at No: 8. He made his Test debut when Ned Gregory, Australia' No: 7 achieved the dubious distinction of being the 1st Test Batsman to score a duck. Australia were 143 for 6. He became Charles Bannerman's 7th partner (Bannerman was 107 not out). Jack Blackham was 22 years 308 days old and became, at that time the youngest Test player in Test cricket. Previously the youngest had been Tom Horan (Australia No: 3) who was 64 days older than Jack Blackham.\n\nAs a right-hand batsman, Blackham was a useful lower-order player. At the age of forty, he played his last Test Match at the SCG against Andrew Stoddart's English team. As Blackham spun the coin on that opening morning, \"Stoddy\" remarked, \"Someone will be swearing directly, Jack. I hope it's you.\"\n\nIt was not: Blackham won the toss and elected to bat, and made 74 runs in a partnership of 154 with Syd Gregory, who scored 201. This helped Australia on its way to a massive (and apparently unassailable) total of 586. After England followed on, Blackham's men were eventually left to make just 176 in the final innings to win. They had scored 113 for the loss of just two wickets at the close of play on the fifth evening, but it rained hard during the night.\n\nBlackham's veteran teammate George Giffen, however, slept right through the storm and was blissfully unaware of it when he got up the following morning, a bright and sunny one. Giffen greeted his captain cheerily at breakfast but was met with a face as \"long as a coffee-pot\". Blackham told him what had happened and forecast ominously the danger as the Australian team travelled to the ground, the carriage leaving deep furrows in the moist turf. Blackham was right to be so concerned: on a horrific \"sticky dog\", his side eventually collapsed to 166 all out, losing the match by ten runs. At the close, with the Englishmen celebrating, \"Blackham walked up and down the balcony like a caged tiger, muttering 'Cruel luck – cruel luck'... In short, the team were thoroughly cut up seeing victory thus snatched away... 'The rain beat us,' said some of them.\"\n\n\"No!\" retorted the Prince of Wicketkeepers. \"The sun beat us\" – which was probably closer to the mark.\n\nBlackham injured himself in this match and never played Test cricket or kept wickets again.\n\nIn his 35 Tests, which included Australia's first seventeen Tests, Blackham made 800 runs at an average of 15.68 (highest score of 74), and dismissed 60 batsmen (36 caught, 24 stumped). In 45 matches for Victoria he scored 1600 runs at 22.85, with one century (109 in 1884), and dismissed 451 batsmen. However, his value as a batsman cannot be judged by averages, as he was often at his best when the game was at a critical stage. He was not a success as a captain as he worried too much when off the field. After his retirement in 1895 a match for his benefit was arranged, and an annuity was bought with the proceeds.\n\nHe captained Australia in eight matches, winning three. His nervous temperament meant that he worried over small setbacks, and could not bear to watch close finishes.\n\nBlackham was also a leading Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) during the 1880s.\n\nBlackham later invested his earnings from his tours of England, without success. A lifelong bachelor, he died in Melbourne, Victoria with his funeral proceeding from St Paul's Cathedral to the Melbourne Crematorium the next morning.\n\nIn 1996 he was made one of the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, the others being Fred Spofforth, Victor Trumper, Clarrie Grimmett, Bill Ponsford, Sir Donald Bradman, Bill O'Reilly, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, and Dennis Lillee.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866743", "title": "Linear code", "text": "Linear code\n\nIn coding theory, a linear code is an error-correcting code for which any linear combination of codewords is also a codeword. Linear codes are traditionally partitioned into block codes and convolutional codes, although turbo codes can be seen as a hybrid of these two types. Linear codes allow for more efficient encoding and decoding algorithms than other codes (cf. syndrome decoding).\n\nLinear codes are used in forward error correction and are applied in methods for transmitting symbols (e.g., bits) on a communications channel so that, if errors occur in the communication, some errors can be corrected or detected by the recipient of a message block. The codewords in a linear block code are blocks of symbols that are encoded using more symbols than the original value to be sent. A linear code of length \"n\" transmits blocks containing \"n\" symbols. For example, the [7,4,3] Hamming code is a linear binary code which represents 4-bit messages using 7-bit codewords. Two distinct codewords differ in at least three bits. As a consequence, up to two errors per codeword can be detected while a single error can be corrected. This code contains 2=16 codewords.\n\nA linear code of length \"n\" and rank \"k\" is a linear subspace \"C\" with dimension \"k\" of the vector space formula_1 where formula_2 is the finite field with \"q\" elements. Such a code is called a \"q\"-ary code. If \"q\" = 2 or \"q\" = 3, the code is described as a binary code, or a ternary code respectively. The vectors in \"C\" are called \"codewords\". The size of a code is the number of codewords and equals \"q\".\n\nThe weight of a codeword is the number of its elements that are nonzero and the distance between two codewords is the Hamming distance between them, that is, the number of elements in which they differ. The distance \"d\" of the linear code is the minimum weight of its nonzero codewords, or equivalently, the minimum distance between distinct codewords. A linear code of length \"n\", dimension \"k\", and distance \"d\" is called an [\"n\",\"k\",\"d\"] code.\n\nWe want to give formula_1 the standard basis because each coordinate represents a \"bit\" that is transmitted across a \"noisy channel\" with some small probability of transmission error (a binary symmetric channel). If some other basis is used then this model cannot be used and the Hamming metric does not measure the number of errors in transmission, as we want it to.\n\nAs a linear subspace of formula_1, the entire code \"C\" (which may be very large) may be represented as the span of a set of formula_5 codewords (known as a basis in linear algebra). These basis codewords are often collated in the rows of a matrix G known as a generating matrix for the code \"C\". When G has the block matrix form formula_6, where formula_7 denotes the formula_8 identity matrix and P is some formula_9 matrix, then we say G is in standard form.\n\nA matrix \"H\" representing a linear function formula_10 whose kernel is \"C\" is called a check matrix of \"C\" (or sometimes a parity check matrix). Equivalently, \"H\" is a matrix whose null space is \"C\". If \"C\" is a code with a generating matrix \"G\" in standard form, formula_6, then formula_12 is a check matrix for C. The code generated by \"H\" is called the dual code of C. It can be verified that G is a formula_13 matrix, while H is a formula_14 matrix.\n\nLinearity guarantees that the minimum Hamming distance \"d\" between a codeword \"c\" and any of the other codewords \"c\" ≠ \"c\" is independent of \"c\". This follows from the property that the difference \"c\" − \"c\" of two codewords in \"C\" is also a codeword (i.e., an element of the subspace \"C\"), and the property that \"d\"(\"c\", c) = \"d\"(\"c\" − \"c\", 0). These properties imply that\n\nIn other words, in order to find out the minimum distance between the codewords of a linear code, one would only need to look at the non-zero codewords. The non-zero codeword with the smallest weight has then the minimum distance to the zero codeword, and hence determines the minimum distance of the code.\n\nThe distance \"d\" of a linear code \"C\" also equals the minimum number of linearly dependent columns of the check matrix \"H\".\n\n\"Proof:\" Because formula_16, which is equivalent to formula_17, where formula_18 is the formula_19 column of formula_20. Remove those items with formula_21, those formula_18 with formula_23 are linearly dependent. Therefore, formula_24 is at least the minimum number of linearly dependent columns. On another hand, consider the minimum set of linearly dependent columns formula_25 where formula_26 is the column index set. formula_27. Now consider the vector formula_28 such that formula_29 if formula_30. Note formula_31 because formula_32 . Therefore, we have formula_33, which is the minimum number of linearly dependent columns in formula_20. The claimed property is therefore proved.\n\nAs the first class of linear codes developed for error correction purpose, \"Hamming codes\" have been widely used in digital communication systems. For any positive integer formula_35, there exists a formula_36 Hamming code. Since formula_37, this Hamming code can correct a 1-bit error.\n\nExample : The linear block code with the following generator matrix and parity check matrix is a formula_38 Hamming code.\n\nHadamard code is a formula_41 linear code and is capable of correcting many errors. Hadamard code could be constructed column by column : the formula_19 column is the bits of the binary representation of integer formula_43, as shown in the following example. Hadamard code has minimum distance formula_44 and therefore can correct formula_45 errors.\n\nExample: The linear block code with the following generator matrix is a formula_46 Hadamard code:\nformula_47.\n\nHadamard code is a special case of Reed–Muller code. If we take the first column (the all-zero column) out from formula_48, we get formula_49 \"simplex code\", which is the \"dual code \" of Hamming code.\n\nThe parameter d is closely related to the error correcting ability of the code. The following construction/algorithm illustrates this (called the nearest neighbor decoding algorithm):\n\nInput: A \"received vector\" v in formula_1 .\n\nOutput: A codeword formula_51 in formula_52 closest to formula_53, if any.\n\n\nWe say that a linear formula_52 is formula_55-error correcting if there is at most one codeword in formula_57, for each formula_53 in formula_1.\n\nCodes in general are often denoted by the letter \"C\", and a code of length \"n\" and of rank \"k\" (i.e., having \"k\" code words in its basis and \"k\" rows in its \"generating matrix\") is generally referred to as an (\"n\", \"k\") code. Linear block codes are frequently denoted as [\"n\", \"k\", \"d\"] codes, where \"d\" refers to the code's minimum Hamming distance between any two code words.\n\n\"Lemma\" (Singleton bound): Every linear [n,k,d] code C satisfies formula_70.\n\nA code C whose parameters satisfy k+d=n+1 is called maximum distance separable or MDS. Such codes, when they exist, are in some sense best possible.\n\nIf C and C are two codes of length n and if there is a permutation p in the symmetric group S for which (c...,c) in C if and only if (c...,c) in C, then we say C and C are permutation equivalent. In more generality, if there is an formula_71 monomial matrix formula_72 which sends C isomorphically to C then we say C and C are equivalent.\n\n\"Lemma\": Any linear code is permutation equivalent to a code which is in standard form.\n\nA code is defined to be equidistant if and only if there exists some constant \"d\" such that the distance between any two of the code's distinct codewords is equal to \"d\". In 1984 Arrigo Bonisoli determined the structure of linear one-weight codes over finite fields and proved that every equidistant linear code is a sequence of dual Hamming codes.\n\nSome examples of linear codes include:\n\nHamming spaces over non-field alphabets have also been considered, especially over finite rings (most notably over Z) giving rise to modules instead of vector spaces and ring-linear codes (identified with submodules) instead of linear codes. The typical metric used in this case the Lee distance. There exist a Gray isometry between formula_73 (i.e. GF(2)) with the Hamming distance and formula_74 (also denoted as GR(4,m)) with the Lee distance; its main attraction is that it establishes a correspondence between some \"good\" codes that are not linear over formula_73 as images of ring-linear codes from formula_74.\n\nMore recently, some authors have referred to such codes over rings simply as linear codes as well.\n\n\n\n"}

He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Westmorland and Lonsdale since 2005.\n\nFarron was the President of the Liberal Democrats from January 2011 to December 2014. Since 7 February 2019 he has been the Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Communities and Local Government, serving alongside Housing Spokesperson The Lord Shipley. In August 2019, new Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson appointed Farron Spokesperson for Communities and Local Government, Work and Pensions, Housing and Planning and the Northern Powerhouse.\n\nFarron was born in Preston, Lancashire, and educated at Lostock Hall High School and Runshaw College, Leyland, before going on to Newcastle University, where he gained a BA in Politics in 1992. Farron has described how, in his youth, his bedroom bore pictures of \"strange sort of left-wing politicians\", including John F. Kennedy and former Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond, as well as former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. From 1987 to 1992 Farron fronted the Preston-based band Tim Farron and the Voyeurs, also known as Fred The Girl. According to Farron, the band were popular amongst Lancashire's youth after a series of highly successful tours. Farron even stated the band was offered a record deal with Island Records. However, this claim has been countered by former band members instead describing 'Tim Farron and the Voyeurs' as a \"fourth rate New Order.\"\n\nIn 1990, he was elected to the National Union of Students' National Executive. The following year, he was elected president of Newcastle University Union Society, the first Liberal Democrat to hold the position, having joined the Liberal Party at the age of 16. Before his election to Parliament, Farron worked in higher education at Lancaster University from 1992 to 2002 and St. Martin's College, Ambleside from 2002 to 2005.\n\nFarron contested North West Durham at the 1992 general election, where he finished in third place, behind the sitting Labour Party MP Hilary Armstrong and Conservative Party candidate (and future Prime Minister) Theresa May. He then served on Lancashire County Council from 1993 to 2000 and was also a councillor for Leyland Central ward on South Ribble Borough Council from 1995 to 1999.\n\nFarron was selected to contest the Labour/Conservative marginal constituency of South Ribble at the 1997 general election, and again finished in third place. Thereafter, he was a Liberal Democrat candidate for the North West region in the 1999 European Parliament elections.\n\nAt the 2001 general election, Farron contested the Westmorland and Lonsdale seat and finished second, reducing the majority of the sitting Conservative MP Tim Collins to 3,167. He then served as a councillor for the Milnthorpe ward on the South Lakeland District Council from 2004 to 2008.\n\nAt the 2005 general election, Farron again fought Collins in Westmorland and Lonsdale, and this time won this election by a narrow margin of just 267 votes. He made his maiden speech in Parliament on 25 May 2005. As a new MP, he became a member of the Education and Skills Select committee and was appointed as Youth Affairs Spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats. In 2005 he founded the all-party parliamentary group on hill farming, of which he was still chair .\n\nDuring Menzies Campbell's period as the Liberal Democrat leader, Farron was Campbell's Parliamentary Private Secretary. In 2007 he was made a Liberal Democrat spokesman for Home Affairs.\n\nFarron resigned from the front bench of the Liberal Democrats on 5 March 2008 in protest at the party's abstention from a parliamentary vote on a proposed Conservative referendum on Britain's accession to the Lisbon Treaty. However he later returned to the party's front bench as spokesperson for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He is a member of the Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, Farron achieved an 11.1% swing from the Conservatives, winning by a majority of 12,264 in his historically Conservative seat. This result was against the run of the rest of the party, making Westmorland and Lonsdale one of the few Liberal Democrat strongholds.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, Farron stood for the position of Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, made vacant by the resignation of Vince Cable. On 9 June, Farron lost the competition to the former party President, Simon Hughes. Hughes won by 20 votes; having had 38 nominations from the parliamentary party, compared to Farron's 18.\n\nOn 16 September 2010, Farron stood for the position of President of the Liberal Democrats following Baroness Scott's decision not to seek re-election. He won the election with 53% of the vote, beating fellow candidate Susan Kramer on 47%.\n\nIn March 2012, Farron was one of three MPs who signed a letter sent to the Advertising Standards Authority, criticising their recent decision to stop the Christian group \"Healing on the Streets of Bath\" from making explicit claims that prayer can heal. The letter called for the ASA to provide indisputable scientific evidence that faith healing did not work; Farron subsequently admitted that the letter was not \"well-worded\" and that he should not have signed it \"as it was written\".\n\nFarron was one of only eight Liberal Democrats elected nationwide at the 2015 general election. He was considered a favourite to succeed Nick Clegg as Leader of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn May 2015, Farron confirmed his bid for the Liberal Democrat leadership on BBC Radio 4. On 16 July he won the leadership election with 56.5% of the vote, ahead of Norman Lamb who achieved 43.5%. Farron's first speech at the Liberal Democrat September 2015 Conference in Bournemouth was praised in the press.\n\nAt the 2017 General Election, Farron narrowly retained his seat with an 8.4% swing to the Conservatives and a majority reduced to 1.5%, while the Liberal Democrats as a whole increased their seats from nine to twelve, although with a reduced overall share of the vote. Farron stated he would step down as party leader following the election, stating that he had become \"torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader\". He remained in office until the unopposed election of Vince Cable as party leader.\n\nAmong political observers, Farron is widely seen as being of left-leaning political position. In a September 2016 interview, he identified the Liberal Democrats under his leadership as being centre-left.\n\nIn August 2015, Farron identified seven campaigning priorities for the Liberal Democrats. These were rural affairs, the EU referendum, mental health, immigration, civil liberties, the green economy, and housing.\n\nFarron was one of only two Liberal Democrat MPs to vote against the under-occupancy penalty (also known as the bedroom tax) in 2012.\n\nIn December 2010, he voted against increasing the cap on undergraduate university tuition fees from £3,000 to £9,000. Referring to Nick Clegg's earlier pledge not to raise fees—and the previous long-standing Liberal Democrat policy of abolishing them—he said: \"Integrity is important. You must not only keep your word but be seen to keep your word. You can say no.\"\n\nHe was the first senior British politician to back the EU proposal for a quota to take in refugees during the Mediterranean crisis. He called for the UK to accept up to 60,000 non-EU refugees to help with the influx. He attended the Refugee solidarity march in London in September 2015 and gave the opening speech. In the 2016 Liberal Democrat Spring Conference, Farron accused the government of cowardice and heartlessness over their current refugee policy.\n\nFarron has said that 50% of target seats will be represented by women and 10 per cent of target seats will be represented by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) candidates.\n\nFarron's appointment of party spokespeople was applauded for its diversity with 12 women and 10 men given positions. Women also took high ranking roles such as defence and economics spokesperson.\n\nIn 2007, he voted against the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations, which for the first time imposed a general restriction on businesses discriminating against people on the grounds of sexual orientation. In May 2015, regarding a court ruling which found that a Belfast bakery had acted unlawfully in refusing to carry out an order for a cake in support of gay marriage, Farron said that \"it's a shame it ended up in court\" and \"it's important that you stand up for people's rights to have their conscience,\" but \"if you’re providing a service, that’s the key thing – you need to do so without prejudice, without discrimination against those who come through your door.\"\n\nHe voted in favour of allowing marriage between two people of same sex at the second reading of the 2013 Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, but he voted not to timetable the debate on the Bill, which would have made it much more difficult to pass had the House of Commons agreed with his position, over concerns of the impact the \"spousal veto\" could have on trans people. He was absent for the vote for gay marriage on the third reading of the Bill.\n\nIn 2014, he voted in favour of extending the right to same sex marriage to Armed Forces personnel outside the United Kingdom. He currently holds a 90.4% rating on the issue of same sex marriage according to the website Public Whip.\n\nDuring an interview in 2015 with Cathy Newman for \"Channel 4 News\", following his election as leader, Farron avoided a question from Newman on his personal beliefs regarding gay sex, saying that his \"views on personal morality [didn't] matter\", adding that to \"understand Christianity is to understand that we are all sinners\". In the build-up to the 2017 General Election he repeated similar lines in another Channel 4 News television interview, before Nigel Evans asked him in Parliament whether he thought being gay was a sin, to which he replied, \"I do not\" and said that he was \"very proud\" to have supported his party's efforts to introduce gay marriage. Later, in a BBC interview, he further stated that he didn't believe \"gay sex\" was a sin. Despite this, Lord Paddick resigned from his post as home affairs spokesperson in June 2017 \"over concerns about the leader's views on various issues\". In 2018, he expressed regret over his previous assertions that he didn't consider homosexual sex to be sinful, saying he felt under pressure from his party which led him to \"foolishly and wrongly\" make a statement \"that was not right\".\n\nFarron's handling of questions regarding LGBT rights and the sinfulness of homosexuality have been heavily criticised by LGBT+ Liberal Democrats, as has his continued association with evangelical anti-'gay lobby' groups, which has been seen as a \"lack of care\" to the LGBT community. Former head of the LGBT+ Liberal Democrats, Chris Cooke, made unsubstantiated complaints to the party about Farron's personal conduct when \"drunk\", and admitted that he \"made up a story to cause trouble\" following his suspension over Twitter comments directed at Conservative MP Anna Soubry.\n\nHe voted against replacing Trident with a like-for-like submarine-based nuclear weapons system.\n\nDespite describing himself as \"a bit of a Eurosceptic\", Farron strongly supported Britain's membership of the European Union, but criticised David Cameron's renegotiation as \"about appealing to careerist Tory MPs, who were selected by Europhobic party members, to persuade them to vote to remain\".\n\nIn June 2016, Farron stated following the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum in which 51.89% of the voters voted to leave the EU that if the Liberal Democrats were elected in the next parliamentary election, they would not follow through with triggering of the Treaty on European Union and leaving the EU but would instead keep the UK in the European Union.\n\nFarron is against the government's proposed plan to return to the traditional blue British passport. He has criticised the move publicly as part of \"ever increasing list of the cost of Brexit\" and holds the position that the plan is \"a completely superficial expenditure which could have been spent on our hospitals and our schools.\"\n\nFarron has criticised Britain's close ties with Saudi Arabia. He said: \"It is time to shine a light onto the shady corners of our relationship with Saudi Arabia. It is time we stood up for civil liberties, human rights and not turn a blind eye because the House of Saud are our 'allies'.\"\n\nHe supports the complete legalisation of marijuana for both medical and recreational purpose, saying that \"I personally believe the war on drugs is over. We must move from making this a legal issue to one of health.\"\n\nFarron is a lifelong non-conformist Protestant and says that \"becoming a Christian at the age of eighteen [was] the most massive choice I have made.\" He is a vegetarian, and a lifelong fan of Blackburn Rovers. In January 2018 he won a round of \"Celebrity Mastermind,\" with Blackburn Rovers as his specialist subject.\n\nIn 2019 he published an autobiography \"A Better Ambition: Confessions of a Faithful Liberal\" describing his life as a Christian and a Liberal.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866751", "title": "Daffney", "text": "Daffney\n\nShannon Claire Spruill (born July 17, 1975) is an American retired professional wrestler and valet, and actress, better known by her ring name, Daffney. She is best known for her appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1999 and 2001 and with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from 2008 to 2011.\n\nAs a \"military brat\", Shannon Claire Spruill was born on July 17, 1975, at the Wiesbaden Army Airfield, a United States Air Force base in Wiesbaden, West Germany, where her father was stationed. In 1976, her family returned to the United States, residing first in Salt Lake City, Utah, then in Savannah, Georgia and finally on the Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, Illinois. They relocated to Oxford in the United Kingdom for three years, before moving to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany until 1987, when her father, by then a Lieutenant Colonel, retired.\n\nIn 1985, she had a small, uncredited part in the film . In March 1998, Spruill graduated from Georgia State University, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Film and Video production, with minors in Acting and Music. She went on to work in Media Production, before pursuing full time acting.\n\nIn November 1999, she responded to a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) contest looking to acquire new talent and was hired. In WCW, Spruill played Daffney, the mentally deranged, besotted girlfriend of David Flair, managing him and Crowbar. One of Daffney's hallmarks was a piercing scream when she was lurking at ringside. The gimmick was based in part on Mallory Knox, the character played by Juliette Lewis in the film \"Natural Born Killers\". Spruill has cited Batman supervillainess Harley Quinn as the original inspiration for the character. Spruill's first appearance was on the December 6 episode of \"Nitro\", when she was shown sitting on her bed and chanting Flair's name.\n\nOn May 8, 2000, Daffney was appointed by Vince Russo to wrestle Miss Elizabeth in Miss Elizabeth's first wrestling match. On May 15, 2000, Daffney and Crowbar defeated WCW World Cruiserweight Champion Chris Candido and his girlfriend Tammy Lynn Sytch in a mixed tag team match and were declared co-champions. The following week on the May 22 episode of \"Nitro\", Crowbar and Daffney faced one another to determine the undisputed World Cruiserweight Champion. Crowbar held back during the match, but still dominated the smaller Daffney. After Candido entered the ring and hit Crowbar with a reverse piledriver, Spruill inadvertently pinned him while trying to revive him and thus became the second woman ever to hold the Cruiserweight Championship. Her reign lasted until June 7 when Lieutenant Loco pinned Disco Inferno in a three-way title defense while Daffney was hurt following interference from Miss Hancock. Daffney went on to feud with Hancock, who had stolen the affections of Flair. Daffney defeated Hancock in the promotion's first ever Wedding Gown match after Hancock removed her own dress. Daffney then became solely the valet for Crowbar. She had a brief feud with Shane Douglas's valet, Torrie Wilson, but was sporadically used as a wrestler.\n\nDaffney's gimmicks included frequently changing hair color, a wide selection of T-Shirts decorated with amusing or bizarre slogans, and her loud screams. She began screaming at the suggestion of WCW writer Ed Ferrara. She was released by WCW on February 2, 2001 due to budget cutbacks (WCW itself was purchased by its rival, the World Wrestling Federation, a month later).\n\nSpruill opted to continue wrestling, attending Dusty Rhodes' Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling training camp in Kennesaw, Georgia for eight months.\n\nShe made several appearances for the fledgling Total Nonstop Action Wrestling promotion in 2002 as Shannon and Shark Girl (valet of Shark Boy), and worked for Xtreme Pro Wrestling in 2003 as Lucy, the manager of Vic Grimes. She also appeared in Ring of Honor, where she debuted on April 26, 2003 as Lucy, the valet of the Second City Saints. In July 2003, Spruill was signed to a developmental deal by World Wrestling Entertainment. She worked in Ohio Valley Wrestling as the manager of Aaron Stevens until she was released on December 17 of the same year.\n\nAfter her release from WWE, Spruill decided to retire from professional wrestling. Intending to focus on her acting career, she sold her wrestling boots to her then-roommate, Mickie James. While retired, Spruill worked as a personal trainer. In June 2005, she posed for a website owned and operated by wrestling divas Francine and Missy Hyatt. In February 2006, Spruill returned to the independent circuit. Spruill debuted in Women's Extreme Wrestling on April 6 under the ring name Lucy Furr (\"Lucifer\"), acting as a lumberjill in a match between Amy Lee and Tai Killer Weed. On June 2, 2006 in Irondale, Alabama, Spruill faced El Mexico for the NWA Wrestle Birmingham Junior Heavyweight Championship. With the help of her manager, Robert Fuller (who referred to Spruill as his \"\"Million Dollar Baby\"\"), Spruill defeated El Mexicano to win her third wrestling title. In February 2007, she began making appearances with Georgia Wrestling Promotions both as a manager and a referee.\n\nIn April 2007, Spruill debuted as Daffney for Shimmer Women Athletes. She conducted an interview where she revealed her goal was to return to what she did from the beginning of her career and that was to manage. Later that evening she appeared as the manager of the wrestler MsChif. In April 2008 she began wrestling as her Shark Girl character. However, she returned to wrestling as Daffney after only a couple of months.\n\nOn November 8, 2009, Daffney teamed with Rachel Summerlyn against the International Home Wrecking Crew at Volume 27, only to turn villainous by abandoning Summerlyn during the match, causing a loss to the IHWC. Later in the night on Volume 28, Daffney got disqualified in a match with Summerlyn, after she did not release an illegal hold off her opponent. On April 11, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 31, the evil Daffney defeated Summerlyn in a No Disqualification match.\n\nOn June 27, 2010 Daffney won her only Women's Championship defeating Rachel Summerlyn in the 1st round of Anarchy Championship Wrestling's 2010 American Joshi Queen of Queens Tournament. She lost the title in the 2nd round to Jessica James.\n\nOn April 6, 2013, Daffney returned to Shimmer Women Athletes at the promotion's first ever internet pay-per-view, Volume 53, where she appeared as the manager of Regeneration X (Allison Danger and Leva Bates).\n\nSpruill re-emerged in TNA on the June 5, 2008 episode of \"TNA Impact!\" as Daffney. She was planted in the audience along with fellow wrestlers Amber O'Neal and Becky Bayless. The three women volunteered to wrestle Awesome Kong in the $25,000 Challenge. Daffney was selected and subsequently defeated by Kong.\n\nIn December 2008 Spruill started playing the role of Alaska governor Sarah Palin in skits involving the Beautiful People. On the January 15 episode of \"Impact!\", it was revealed by Taylor Wilde and Roxxi that \"Sarah Palin\" was indeed fake, and it had all been a big joke by Roxxi and Taylor to get revenge on The Beautiful People. The next week she was seen in an interview with Lauren, where they made fun of the Beautiful People. The Beautiful People then proceeded to viciously attack \"The Governor\" before being pulled away by Cute Kip as Spruill lay injured. On the February 5, 2009, episode of \"Impact!\", she made her return by attacking the Beautiful People, this time complete with entrance video and theme. She made her PPV debut at Destination X in a winning effort when she teamed with Roxxi and Wilde to defeat The Beautiful People and Madison Rayne.\n\nAs a result of having her hair cut by the Beautiful People on the March 19 episode of \"Impact!\", Spruill transformed into her old Daffney ring name and gimmick on the April 2 episode of \"Impact!\", when she appeared in on-screen psychiatrist Dr. Stevie's office for a therapy session. On the April 16 episode of \"Impact!\", she teamed with Stevie's other patient Abyss to defeat the duo of ODB and Cody Deaner in a mixed tag team match. She competed in the Queen of the Cage match at Lockdown against ODB, Madison Rayne and Sojournor Bolt, but failed to win the match. On the May 14 episode of \"Impact!\", Daffney turned heel by assaulting Taylor Wilde, because she did not save her when The Beautiful People cut her hair. At Sacrifice Wilde defeated Daffney, who had Abyss and Dr. Stevie in her corner, in the first ever Monster's Ball match. After she and Dr. Stevie began associating themselves with the returning Raven, Daffney defeated Wilde with their help in a rematch on the June 4 episode of \"Impact\" with her swinging fisherman suplex named the Lobotomy. The following week Daffney assaulted Wilde backstage after provoking her by attacking her on-screen best friend, backstage interviewer Lauren, earlier on the same night. Daffney and Raven were defeated by Abyss and Taylor Wilde at Slammiversary in a Monster's Ball mixed tag match. During the match Wilde slammed Daffney onto a pile of thumbtacks. The following Thursday on \"Impact!\", she and Wilde faced off in the first ever \"Match of 10,000 Tacks\", which she lost.\n\nAt Bound for Glory, Daffney interfered in a Monster's Ball match between Abyss and Mick Foley, who had assigned Abyss' rival and Daffney's associate Dr. Stevie as the special guest referee of the match. During the match Abyss chokeslammed Daffney from the ring apron through a barbed wire board, although reports indicated she had suffered a broken arm, it was later reported to be inaccurate although she had instead suffered a concussion. On the November 12 episode of \"Impact!\", Raven once again returned to TNA to reform the group of himself, Dr. Stevie and Daffney.\n\nDaffney spent the next couple of months mainly managing Stevie and Raven, before making her in-ring return on the February 18, 2010, episode of \"Impact!\", losing to the TNA Women's Knockout Champion Tara via disqualification, after hitting her with a toolbox. After the match, Daffney continued her assault, before being dragged away by Dr. Stevie. The following week on \"Impact!\" she annihilated ODB in similar fashion as it was noted that she had her eye set on the title. On the March 8 episode of \"Impact!\", Daffney cost Tara and her tag team partner Angelina Love the Knockouts Tag Team Championship by hitting her with the Women's Knockout Championship belt during a match for the vacant titles. At Destination X Daffney failed in her attempt to win the Knockout Championship from Tara, but managed to steal her spider Poison from her after the match. The following day on \"Impact!\" Daffney used distraction from Poison to pin Tara in an eight wrestler tag team match to earn her a First Blood match for the Women's Knockout Championship the following week. The following week Tara defeated Daffney in a First Blood match after hitting her with a toolbox. The following week Daffney was one of the four winners in an eight knockout Lockbox match, contested for four keys to four boxes containing prizes. During the contest Tara, one of the three other winners, won back Poison, while Daffney came up empty handed and was forced to strip down, but before she could she was attacked by Lacey Von Erich. The attack resulted in a match on the April 19 episode of \"Impact!\", where Daffney, now seemingly a face, and a partner of her choice, ODB, unsuccessfully challenged Von Erich and Velvet Sky for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. At the following day's \"Impact!\" tapings, Daffney was injured in a dark match against Miss Betsy in her tryout match and was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a deeply bruised sternum, a severe stinger, and a concussion.\n\nOn May 26 it was announced that Spruill had been cleared to return to wrestling. She made her return at the June 14 tapings of \"Xplosion\", wrestling once again as a heel and defeating Taylor Wilde with the help of a chain, only to have the referee of the match catch her afterwards, leading to Wilde defeating her after a restart. On the December 9 episode of \"Impact!\", Daffney teamed with Sarita in a first round match of a tournament for the vacant TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, where they were defeated by the Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky). This marked Daffney's final appearance for TNA as on March 15, 2011, her contract with the promotion expired and was not renewed. Spruill announced that she had filed a workers' compensation claim against TNA for injuries suffered while wrestling for the promotion, believing she had been put in an unsafe working environment. Spruill later also claimed that she did not believe she could ever wrestle again due to the accumulated injuries she had suffered during her career. The lawsuit was settled out of court on March 8, 2013.\n\nIn early 2009 Spruill took part in the first season tapings of Wrestlicious, which started airing in March 2010, using the character of Draculetta. She debuted on March 17 in the main event of the third episode of \"Takedown\", teaming with White Magic in a tag team match, where they lost via disqualification to the team of Lacey Von Erich and Amber Lively.\n\nIn July 2012, Daffney began working as the \"hostess\" of the new Shine Wrestling promotion. She held the position until May 2013, when she returned to the role of a manager. Daffney became a villainess in July 2015, when she became the manager of the Iron Maidens, sending them to attack various tag teams during matches.\n\nIn August 2018, Daffney made an appearance on Ring of Honor wrestling television for the Women of Honor Championship tournament between Sumie Sakai and Kelly Klein. After Sakai defeated Klein for the tournament, Daffney and the other women congratulated Sakai for her victory.\n\nSpruill was married to guitarist Rich Ward of Stuck Mojo and Fozzy.\n\nOn July 19, 2011, Spruill was arrested in Hillsborough County, Florida for \"driving under the influence with property damage\". Spruill later pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to one year probation and a fine of $1,580.\n\n\n\n"}

However, it is a general purpose template engine, with no dependency on servlets or HTTP or HTML, and is thus often used for generating source code, configuration files or e-mails.\n\nFreeMarker had a somewhat hectic history until about 2004, caused by paradigm shifts and other significant changes on multiple occasions. FreeMarker 1 (now known as FreeMarker Classic, a separate project) was originally written by Benjamin Geer and Mike Bayer. \nFrom 2002, the new project lead was Jonathan Revusky, who released FreeMarker 2, which started a sequence of several substantial changes. The main goal of the changes was to make the template language more strict, i.e., to detect as many of the typos and other typical mistakes as possible. Also, automatic object wrapping was introduced, along with gradual advancement of the type system of the template language. The language has gained many power-user features, such as more powerful macro programming capabilities and namespaces. The language has reached a quite settled state with version 2.3, released in 2004 Q3. As of 2016, the product has remained backward compatible. No significant backward incompatible changes are expected in the FreeMarker 2 series in the future.\n\nIn late 2015, FreeMarker was granted to the Apache Software Foundation, where it has entered the Apache Incubator, and in 2018-03-21 it has become a fully accepted Apache project.\n\nThe following template:\n<html>\n<body>\n<p>Hello ${name}!

You have the following messages:\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\nVariables like \"name\" and \"messages\" are coming from outside the template, and thus the template author has to deal with the presentation issues only. The template remains the same regardless if these variables are coming from a database or from a cookie or calculated in whatever other ways. Also the exact Java API (and hence the class) of the values can be hidden in FreeMarker using a technique called object wrapping. For example, \"messages\" seems to be a list or array of JavaBeans that have \"from\" and \"body\" properties, but it might as well be something very different, and the template is not affected (as long as a proper object wrapper is used).\n\n\n"}

The island covers an area of and has 113 inhabitants, . It comes under the administration of Odder municipality. Tunø By is the only village on the island, with the hamlet of Løkkegårde as the second most populated area.\n\nTunø harbour, lies a little east of the town of Tunø By, and is protected by 2 piers. The marina here has room for approximately 170 boats. From the harbour there is a daily ferry service to and from the town of Hou, Jutland.\n\nEvery summer Tunø hosts Tunø Festival, a popular music festival attracting Danish and international artists alike. In 2016, Tunø Festival enjoyed its 30th anniversary.\n\nTunø church was most likely built in the 14th century in a Romanesque style, however it has undergone many refurbishments and now stands as a Gothic church with stepped gables or corbie steps. The church is famous for its tower which also functions as a lighthouse. The tower was originally completed in 1801. It was extended to a height of above sea level in 1820. The tower was again heightened in 1906 to improve view to and from the lighthouse. In the past the minister would have also served as the lighthouse keeper.\n\nIn 1216 the Danish king Valdemar II handed over control of Tunø to the bishop of Aarhus. Inside Tunø church the minister and parish clerk's seats, which date from around 1520, are carved with the coat of arms of Niels Clausen Skade, the then bishop of Aarhus.\n\nThe church is adorned with several frescoes and triptychs. The sepulchral tablet on the north wall of the choir has a fresco depicting the vicar Jørgen Hansen, who was said to have been tossed by a bull in 1640. A triptych, with two moveable panels that were painted by evangelists in 1731, is a cupboard altar from around 1490. The triptych depicts the Virgin Mary as heavenly Queen perched on a crescent holding the Baby Jesus in her left arm whilst holding a bunch of grapes in her right hand. The Virgin Mary is flanked by Saint Clemens with an anchor and Saint Alexius. This is believed to be the only depiction of Saint Alexius in Denmark.\n\nIt is said that prior to the foundation of the church, Tunø's residents would sail to nearby Samsø to attend Nordby Kirke, whose bricked up northern door is referred to as \"Tunboernes dør\" or Tunø islander's door.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866758", "title": "Tea culture", "text": "Tea culture\n\nTea culture is defined by the way tea is made and consumed, by the way the people interact with tea, and by the aesthetics surrounding tea drinking.\n\nTea plays an important role in some countries. It is commonly consumed at social events, and many cultures have created intricate formal ceremonies for these events. Afternoon tea is a British custom with widespread appeal. Tea ceremonies, with their roots in the Chinese tea culture, differ among East Asian countries, such as the Japanese or Korean versions. Tea may differ widely in preparation, such as in Tibet, where the beverage is commonly brewed with salt and butter. Tea may be drunk in small private gatherings (tea parties) or in public (tea houses designed for social interaction).\n\nThe British Empire spread its own interpretation of tea to its dominions and colonies, including regions that today comprise the states of Hong Kong, India, and Pakistan, which had pre-existing tea customs, as well as regions such as East Africa (modern-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) which did not have tea customs. The tea room or teahouse is found in the US, the UK, and Ireland.\n\nDifferent regions favour different varieties of tea—white, yellow, green, oolong, black, or post-fermented (dark)—and use different flavourings, such as herbs, milk, or sugar. The temperature and strength of the tea likewise vary widely.\n\nBubble tea, pearl milk tea (), or boba milk tea () is a tea beverage mixture with milk which includes balls of tapioca. Originating in Taiwan, it is especially popular in East Asia and Southeast Asia, including Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, as well as India, Sri Lanka, Europe, Canada, and the United States. It is also known as black pearl tea or tapioca tea.\n\nTaiwanese tea culture also encompasses a more traditional Chinese tea culture followed by Han Chinese on the island. Wild tea was first found in Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company. Since then, successive waves of immigration from mainland China to Taiwan have left a legacy of influences on tea culture.\n\nDue to the importance of tea in Chinese society and culture, tea houses can be found in most Chinese neighbourhoods and business districts. Chinese-style tea houses offer dozens of varieties of hot and cold tea concoctions. They also serve a variety of tea-friendly or tea-related snacks. Beginning in the late afternoon, the typical Chinese tea house quickly becomes packed with students and business people, and later at night playing host to insomniacs and night owls simply looking for a place to relax.\n\nThere are formal tea houses. They provide a range of Chinese and Japanese tea leaves, as well as tea making accoutrements and a better class of snack food. Finally there are tea vendors, who specialize in the sale of tea leaves, pots, and other related paraphernalia. Tea is an important item in Chinese culture and is mentioned in the Seven necessities of (Chinese) daily life.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, Lu Yu found that the plants which grow under shady hillsides produced poor quality tea, often resulting in abdominal distension. The common methods of making tea at the time were boiling the water and tea leaves at the same time. The water was heated in a cauldron on a brazier to the first boil level, which was described as \"fish eyes”. Appropriate salts were added into the water with a view to enhancing the flavor of the tea.\nTwo periods\n\nIn China, at least as early as the Tang Dynasty, tea was an object of connoisseurship; in the Song Dynasty formal tea-tasting parties were held, comparable to modern wine tastings. As much as in modern wine tastings, the proper vessel was important and much attention was paid to matching the tea to an aesthetically appealing serving vessel.\n\nHistorically there were two phases of tea drinking in China based on the form of tea that was produced and consumed, namely: \"tea bricks\" versus \"loose leaf tea\".\n\nTea brick phase\n\nTea served before the Ming Dynasty was typically made from tea bricks. Upon harvesting, the tea leaves were either partially dried or were thoroughly dried and ground before being pressed into bricks. The pressing of Pu-erh is likely a vestige of this process. Tea bricks were also sometimes used as currency. Serving the tea from tea bricks required multiple steps:\n\nThe ground and whisked teas used at that time called for dark and patterned bowls in which the texture of the tea powder suspension could be enjoyed. The best of these bowls, glazed in patterns with names like oil spot, partridge-feather, hare's fur, and tortoise shell, are highly valued today. The patterned holding bowl and tea mixture were often lauded in the period's poetry with phrases such as \"partridge in swirling clouds\" or \"snow on hare's fur\". Tea in this period was enjoyed more for its patterns and less for its flavour. The practice of using powdered tea can still be seen in the Japanese Tea ceremony or \"Chadō\".\n\nLoose-leaf tea phase\n\nAfter 1391, the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming Dynasty, decreed that tributes of tea to the court were to be changed from brick to loose-leaf form. The imperial decree quickly transformed the tea drinking habits of the people, changing from whisked teas to steeped teas. The arrival of the new method for preparing tea also required the creation or use of new vessels.\n\nTeawares made with a special kind of purple clay (Zisha) from Yixing went on to develop during this period (Ming Dynasty). The structure of purple clay made it advantageous material with tiny and high density, preferred for heat preservation and perviousness.\nSimplicity and rusticity dominated the idea of purple clay teaware decoration art. It soon became the most popular method of performing Chinese tea ceremony, which often combines literature, calligraphy, painting and seal cutting in Chinese culture.\n\nThe loose-leaf tea and the purple clay teaware is still the preferred method of preparing tea in Chinese daily life.\n\nButter, milk, and salt are added to brewed tea and churned to form a hot drink called Po cha (\"bod ja\", where \"bod\" means Tibetan and \"ja\" tea) in Tibet, Bhutan, and Nepal. The concoction is sometimes called \"cha su mar\", mainly in Kham, or Eastern Tibet. Traditionally, the drink is made with a domestic brick tea and yak's milk, then mixed in a churn for several minutes. Using a generic black tea, milk and butter, and shaking or blending work well too, although the unique taste of yak milk is difficult to replicate. (see recipe)\n\nTibet tea drinking has many rules. One such concerns an invitation to a house for tea. The host will first pour some highland barley wine. The guest must dip his finger in the wine and flick some away. This will be done three times to represent respect for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The cup will then be refilled two more times and on the last time it must be emptied or the host will be insulted. After this the host will present a gift of butter tea to the guest, who will accept it without touching the rim of the bowl. The guest will then pour a glass for himself, and must finish the glass or be seen as rude.\n\nThere are two main teas that go with the tea culture. The teas are butter tea and sweet milk tea. These two teas are only found in Tibet. Other teas that the Tibetans enjoy are boiled black teas. There are many tea shops in Tibet selling these teas, which travelers often take for their main hydration source.\n\nThe English-style tea has evolved into a new local style of drink, the Hong Kong-style milk tea, more often simply \"milk tea\", in Hong Kong by using evaporated milk instead of ordinary milk. It is popular at \"cha chaan tengs\" and fast food shops such as Café de Coral and Maxims Express. Traditional Chinese tea, including green tea, flower tea, jasmine tea, and Pu-erh tea, are also common, and are served at dim sum restaurants during \"yum cha\".\n\nAnother Hong Kong speciality is lemon tea - served in cafes and restaurants as regular black tea with several slices of fresh lemon, either hot or cold, with a pot of sugar to add to taste. In 1979, local drinks manufacturer Vitasoy introduced a packaged brand, which remains popular and is gaining market traction in mainland China. Other brands followed suit in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Korean tea ceremony or \"darye\" (茶禮) is a traditional form of tea ceremony practiced in Korea. Darye literally refers to \"\"etiquette for tea\"\" or \"\"tea rite.\"\" The chief element of the Korean tea ceremony is the ease and naturalness of enjoying tea within an easy formal setting. Central to the Korean approach to tea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation.\n\nGreen tea's traditional role in Japanese society is as a drink for special guests and special occasions. Green tea is served in many companies during afternoon breaks. Japanese often buy sweets for their colleagues when on vacation or business trips. These snacks are usually enjoyed with green tea. Tea will also be prepared for visitors coming for meetings to companies and for guests visiting Japanese homes. A thermos full of green tea is a staple on family or school outings as an accompaniment to bento (box lunches). Families often bring along proper Japanese teacups to enhance the enjoyment of the traditional drink.\n\nThe strong cultural association the Japanese have with green tea has made it the most popular beverage to drink with traditional Japanese cuisine, such as sushi, sashimi, and tempura. At a restaurant, a cup of green tea is often served with meals at no extra charge, with as many refills as desired. The best traditional Japanese restaurants take as much care in choosing the tea they serve as in preparing the food itself.\n\nMany Japanese are still taught the proper art of the centuries-old tea ceremony as well. Still, the Japanese now enjoy green tea processed using state of the art technology. Today, hand pressing—a method demonstrated to tourists—is taught only as a technique preserved as a part of the Japanese cultural tradition. Most of the ubiquitous vending machines also carry a wide selection of both hot and cold bottled teas. Oolong tea enjoys considerable popularity. Black tea, often with milk or lemon, is served ubiquitously in cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants.\n\nMajor tea-producing areas in Japan include Shizuoka Prefecture and the city of Uji in Kyoto Prefecture.\n\nOther infusions bearing the name \"cha\" are barley tea (\"mugi-cha\") which is popular as a cold drink in the summer, buckwheat tea (\"soba-cha\"), and hydrangea tea (\"ama-cha\").\n\nMyanmar is one of very few countries where tea is not only drunk but eaten as lahpet—pickled tea served with various accompaniments. It is called \"lahpet so\" (tea wet) in contrast to \"lahpet chauk\" (tea dry) or \"akyan jauk\" (crude dry) with which green tea—\"yeinway jan\" or \"lahpet yeijan\" meaning plain or crude tea—is made. In the Shan State of Myanmar where most of the tea is grown, and also Kachin State, tea is dry-roasted in a pan before adding boiling water to make green tea. It is the national drink. Tea sweetened with milk is known as \"lahpet yeijo\" made with \"acho jauk\" (sweet dry) or black tea and prepared the Indian way, brewed and sweetened with condensed milk. It is a very popular drink although the middle classes by and large appear to prefer coffee most of the time. It was introduced to Myanmar by Indian immigrants some of whom set up teashops known as \"kaka hsaing\", later evolving to just \"lahpetyei hsaing\" (teashop).\n\nIt is common for Buremese to gather in tea shops drinking Indian tea served with a diverse range of snacks. Green tea is customarily the first thing to be served free of charge as soon as a customer sits down at a table in all restaurants as well as teashops.\n\nTeashops are extremely prevalent, and are open for breakfast till late in the evening, with some even open for 24 hour catering for long distance drivers and travellers.\n\nLahpet (pickled tea) is served in one of two ways:\n\nThai tea (also known as Thai iced tea) or \"cha-yen\" () when ordered in Thailand is a drink made from strongly-brewed red tea that usually contains added anise, red and yellow food colouring, and sometimes other spices as well. This tea is sweetened with sugar and condensed milk and served chilled. Evaporated or whole milk is generally poured over the tea and ice before serving without mixing to add taste and creamy appearance. Locally, it is served in a traditional tall glass and when ordered take-out, it is poured over the crushed ice in a clear (or translucent) plastic bag. It can be made into a frappé at more westernised vendors.\n\nIt is popular in Southeast Asia and in many American restaurants that serve Thai or Vietnamese food, especially on the West Coast of the United States. Although Thai tea is not the same as bubble tea, a Southeast and East Asian beverage that contains large black pearls of tapioca starch, Thai tea with pearls is a popular flavour of bubble tea.\n\nGreen tea is also very popular in Thailand, spawning many variations such as barley green tea, rose green tea, lemon green tea, etc. Thai green tea, however, is not to be confused with traditional Japanese green tea. Thai green tea tends to be very heavily commercialised and the taste is sweeter.\n\nTea is cultivated extensively in the north of the country, making Vietnam one of the world's largest exporters. The word in the Vietnamese language is trà (pronounced cha/ja) or chè. It is served unsweetened and unaccompanied by milk, cream, or lemon.\n\nTraditionally tea is frequently consumed as green tea (trà xanh). Variants of black tea (chè tàu) is also widely used although frequently scented with \"Jasminum sambac\" blossoms (chè nhài, trà lài). Huế is renowned for its tea scented with \"Nelumbo nucifera\" stamens (trà sen).\n\nIn Vietnamese restaurants, including eateries overseas, a complimentary pot of tea is usually served once the meal has been ordered, with refills free of charge.\n\nOne of the world's largest producers of tea, India is a country where tea is popular all over as a breakfast and evening drink. It is often served as masala chai with milk, sugar, and spices such as ginger, cardamom, black pepper and cinnamon. Almost all the tea consumed is black Indian tea, CTC variety. Usually tea leaves are boiled in water while making tea, and milk is added.\n\nOffering tea to visitors is the cultural norm in Indian homes, offices and places of business. Tea is often consumed at small roadside stands, where it is prepared by tea makers known as \"chai wallahs\".\n\nThere are three most famous regions in India to produce black teas- Darjeeling, Assam and Nilgiri. \"Strong, heavy and fragrant\" are 3 criteria for judging black tea.\nDarjeeling tea is known for its delicate aroma and light colour and is aptly termed as \"the champagne of teas\", which has high aroma and yellow or brown liquid after brewing. Assam tea is known for its robust taste and dark colour, and Nilgiri tea is dark, intensely aromatic and flavoured. Assam produces the largest quantity of Tea in India, mostly of the CTC variety, and is one of the biggest suppliers of major international brands such as Lipton and Tetley. The Tetley Brand, formerly British owned and one of the largest, is now owned by the Indian Tata Tea Limited company.\n\nOn April 21, 2012 the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission (India), Montek Singh Ahluwalia, said that tea would be declared as national drink by April 2013. Speaking on the occasion, former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said a special package for the tea industry would be announced in the future to ensure its development. The move was expected to boost the tea industry in the country, but in May 2013 the ministry of commerce decided not to declare a national drink for fear of disrupting the competing coffee industry.\n\nTea is popular all over Pakistan and is referred to as \"chai\" (چائے). During British Rule tea became very popular in Lahore. Tea is usually consumed at breakfast, during lunch breaks at the workplace, and in the evening at home. Evening tea may be consumed with biscuits or cake. Guests are typically offered a choice between tea and soft drinks. It is common practice for homeowners to offer tea breaks to hired labour, and sometimes even provide them with tea during the breaks. Tea offered to labour is typically strong and has more sugar in it.\n\nIn Pakistan, both black and green teas are popular and are known locally as \"sabz chai\" and \"kahwah\", respectively. The popular green tea called kahwah is often served after every meal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan. In Lahore and other cities of Punjab Kashmiri chai or cha is common, brought by ethnic Kashmiris in the 19th century. Traditionally, it is prepared with Himalayan rock salt, giving it its characteristic pink color. It is taken with Bakar khani as well as Kashmiri kulcha (namkeen/salty version of Khand kulcha). Namkeen chai or noon/loon Cha or commonly called Kashmri chai and sometimes sheer (milk) cha or sabz chai (green tea as the same tea are used for making khahwa/green tea) is sold and seen in Gawalmandi kiosks with salt for Kashmiri as well as with sugar and pistachios for non-Kashmris. In the northern Pakistan regions of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, a salty buttered Tibetan style tea is consumed.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, black tea is usually served with milk and sugar, but the milk is always warmed. Tea is a hugely popular beverage among the Sri Lankan people, and part of its land is surrounded by the many hills of tea plantations that spread for miles. Drinking tea has become part of the culture of Sri Lanka and it is customary to offer a cup of tea to guests. Many working Sri Lankans are used to having a mid-morning cup of tea and another in the afternoon. Black tea is sometimes consumed with ginger. In rural areas, some people still have their tea with a piece of sweet jaggery.\n\nTea found its way to Persia (Iran) through the Silk Road from India and soon became the national drink. The whole part of northern Iran along the shores of the Caspian Sea is suitable for the cultivation of tea. Especially in the Gilan province on the slopes of Alborz, large areas are under tea cultivation and millions of people work in the tea industry. That region covers a large part of Iran's need for tea. Iranians have one of the highest per capita rates of tea consumption in the world and since old times every street has had a \"Châikhâne\" (Tea House). Châikhânes are still an important social place. Iranians traditionally drink tea by pouring it into a saucer and putting a lump of rock sugar (\"qand\") in the mouth before drinking the tea.\n\nAs of 2016, Turkey tops the per capita tea consumption statistics at 6.96 pounds.\n\nTurkish tea or Çay is produced on the eastern Black Sea coast, which has a mild climate with high precipitation and fertile soil. Turkish tea is typically prepared using çaydanlık, an instrument especially designed for tea preparation, essentially an on-top-of-the-kitchen-range replacement for the more traditional samovar. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top - demlik - and steep several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. When served, the continually cooking water from the bottom part is used to dilute the strong tea from the top part on a per cup basis, giving each serving the choice between strong (\"koyu\"/dark) or weak (\"açık\"/light). Tea is drunk from small glasses to enjoy it hot in addition to show its colour, with lumps of beetroot sugar, either dissolved in the cup for sweetness, or pressed between the tongue tip and upper palate for reduced sugar intake (kırtlama). To a lesser extent than in other Muslim countries, tea replaces both alcohol and coffee as the social beverage. Within Turkey the tea is usually known as Rize tea.\n\nIn 2004, Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being exported. In 2010 Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the world at 2.7 kg. As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.\n\nTea is the national drink in Egypt. In Egypt, tea is called \"shai\". Tea packed and sold in Egypt is almost exclusively imported from Kenya and Sri Lanka. The Egyptian government considers tea a strategic crop and runs large tea plantations in Kenya. Green tea is a recent arrival to Egypt (only in the late 1990s did green tea become affordable) and is not as popular.\n\nEgyptian tea comes in two varieties: Koshary and Saiidi. Koshary tea, popular in Lower (Northern) Egypt, is prepared using the traditional method of steeping black tea in boiled water and letting it set for a few minutes. It is almost always sweetened with cane sugar and is often flavored with fresh mint leaves. Adding milk is also common. Koshary tea is usually light, with less than a half teaspoonful per cup considered to be near the high end.\n\nSaiidi tea is common in Upper (Southern) Egypt. It is prepared by boiling black tea with water for as long as 5 minutes over a strong flame. Saiidi tea is extremely heavy, with 2 teaspoonfuls per cup being the norm. It is sweetened with copious amounts of cane sugar (a necessity since the formula and method yield a very bitter tea). Saiidi tea is often black even in liquid form.\n\nBesides true tea, herbal teas (or tisanes) are often served at the Egyptian teahouses, with ingredients ranging from mint to cinnamon and ginger to salep; many of these are ascribed medicinal qualities or health benefits in Egyptian folk medicine. Karkade, a tisane of hibiscus flowers, is a particularly popular beverage and is traditionally considered beneficial for the heart.\n\nLibyan tea is a strong beverage, black or green, served in small glass cups with foam or froth topping the glass. it is usually sweetened with sugar and traditionally served in three rounds. mint or basil is used for flavoring and traditionally the last round is served with boiled peanuts or almonds.\n\nTea plays an important part in the culture of Mauritius. Tea drinking allows for socialising with it commonly being served to guests and in the workplace.\n\nThe Mauritian peoples usually consume black tea, often with milk and sugar. Mauritius is a producer of tea, initially on a small scale when the French introduced the plant into the island around 1765. It was under later British rule that the scale of tea cultivation increased.\n\nThree major tea producers dominate the local market these are Bois Cheri, Chartreuse and Corson. The signature product is the vanilla-flavoured tea which is commonly bought and consumed on the island.\n\nMorocco is considered the largest importer of green tea worldwide.\n\nTea was introduced to Morocco in the 18th century through trade with Europe.\n\nMorocco consumes green tea with mint rather than black tea. It has become part of the culture and is used widely at almost every meal. The Moroccan people even make tea performance a special culture in the flower country. Moroccan tea is commonly served with rich tea cookies, fresh green mint leaves, local \"finger shape\" brown sugar, and colorful tea glasses and pots. Drinking Moroccan tea is not only a luxury of tongue, but also the eyes.\n\nIn the Sahel region on the southern fringe of the Sahara, such as in Mali, green gunpowder tea is prepared with little water and large amounts of sugar. By pouring the tea into the glasses and back, a foam builds on top of the tea. Sahelian tea is a social occasion and three infusions, the first one very bitter (\"bitter as death\"), the second in between (\"flavorful as life\") and the last one rather sweet (\"sweet as love\") are taken in the course of several hours. Drinking tea is a social activity that is accompanied by conversation and storytelling.\n\nTea was transported to Central Asia by way of the Silk Road. In Kazakhstan traditional tea is black traditionally with milk, in Uzbekistan traditional tea is green.\n\nSpecific tea culture has developed in the Czech Republic in recent years, including many styles of tearooms. Despite having the same name, they differ from British tearooms. Pure teas are usually prepared with respect to their country of origin, and good tea palaces may offer 80 teas from almost all tea-producing countries. Different tea rooms have also created blends and methods of preparation and serving.\n\nAlthough less visible than in the Czech Republic, tea culture exists in Slovakia. Tea rooms are considered an underground environment by many, but they continue to pop up almost in every middle-sized town. These tea rooms are appreciated for offering quiet environments with pleasant music. More importantly, they are usually non-smoking, unlike most pubs and cafés.\n\nThe region of East Frisia is noted for its consumption of tea and its tea culture. Strong blends of Assam tea, Ceylon and Darjeeling (East-Frisian Blend) are served whenever there are visitors to an East Frisian home or other gathering, as well as with breakfast, mid-afternoon, and mid-evening.\n\nThe traditional preparation is as follows: A \"Kluntje\", a white rock candy sugar that melts slowly, is added to the empty cup (allowing multiple cups to be sweetened) then tea is poured over the Kluntje. A heavy cream \"cloud\" (\"Wölkje\"—a diminutive of 'cloud' in Frisian) is added to the tea \"water\", the sugar represents \"land\". It is served without a spoon and traditionally drunk unstirred, i. e. in three tiers: In the beginning, one predominantly tastes the cream, then the tea and finally the sweet taste of kluntje at the bottom of the cup. Stirring the tea would blend all three tiers into one and spoil the traditional tea savouring. The tea is generally served with small cookies during the week and cakes during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat. The tea is said to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments. The tea set is commonly decorated with an East Friesian Rose design. As a guest, it is considered impolite to drink fewer than three cups of tea. Placing your cup upside down on the saucer or your spoon in the cup signals that you are finished and want no more tea.\n\nThe podstakannik ('подстаканник'), or tea glass holder (literally \"thing under the glass\"), is a part of Russian tea tradition. A Russian tea glass-holder is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, other CIS and ex-USSR countries. Expensive podstakanniks are made from silver, classic series are made mostly from nickel silver, cupronickel, and other alloys with nickel, silver or gold plating. In Russia, it is customary to drink tea brewed separately in a teapot and diluted with freshly boiled water ('pair-of-teapots tea', 'чай парой чайников'). Traditionally, the tea is very strong, its strength often indicating the hosts' degree of hospitality. The traditional implement for boiling water for tea used to be the samovar (and sometimes it still is, though usually electric). Tea is a family event, and is usually served after each meal with sugar (one to three teaspoonfuls per cup) and lemon (but without milk), and an assortment of jams, pastries and confections. Black tea is commonly used, with green tea gaining popularity as a more healthy, more \"Oriental\" alternative. Teabags are not used in the traditional Russian tea ceremony, only loose, large-leaf black tea.\n\nIn Russian prisons, where alcohol and drugs are prohibited, inmates often brew very strong tea known as 'chifir', in order to experience its mood-altering properties.\n\nWhile France is well known for its coffee drinking, afternoon tea has long been a social habit of the upper-middle class. Mariage Frères is a famous high-end tea shop from Paris, active since 1854. The French tea market is still only a fraction of the British one (a consumption of 250 grams per person a year compared to about 2 kilos in the UK), but it has doubled from 1995 to 2005 and is growing steadily. Tea in France is of the black variety, but Asian green teas and fruit-flavoured teas are becoming increasingly popular. French people generally drink tea in the afternoon. It is often taken in \"salons de thé\". Tea is generally served with some pastries, both sweet and pastries made especially for tea.\n\nIreland is the second-biggest per capita consumers of tea in the world with consumption of per person per year. Although broadly similar to tea culture in the United Kingdom, Irish tea culture has a number of distinguishing elements; for example, tea in Ireland is usually taken with milk or sugar and is slightly spicier and stronger than the traditional English Blend. Popular brands of tea sold in Ireland are Barry's, Bewley's and Lyons.\n\nTea growing in Portugal takes place in the Azores, a group of islands located 1500 km west of Mainland Portugal. Portugal was the first to introduce the practice of drinking tea to Europe as well as the first European country to produce tea.\n\nIn 1750, terrains ranging from the fields of Capelas to those of Porto Formoso on the island of São Miguel were used for the first trial crops of tea, delivering 10 kg of black tea and 8 kg of green tea. A century later, with the introduction of skilled workers from the Macau Region of China in 1883, production became significant and the culture expanded. Following the instructions of these workers, the species \"Jasminum grandiflorum\" and \"Malva vacciones\" were introduced to give 'nobility' to the tea aroma, though only the Jasminum was used.\n\nThis tea is currently traded under the name of the processed compound, \"Gorreana\", and is produced by independent families. No herbicides or pesticides are allowed in the growing process, and modern consumers associate the production with more recent organic teas. However, production standards concerning the plant itself and its cropping have not changed for the last 250 years.\n\nThe British are one of the largest tea consumers in the world, with each person consuming on average 1.9 kg per year. Tea is usually black tea served with milk and sometimes with sugar. Strong tea served with lots of milk and often two teaspoons of sugar, usually in a mug, is commonly referred to as \"builder's tea\" for its association with builders and more broadly with the working class. Much of the time in the United Kingdom, tea drinking is not the delicate, refined cultural expression that the rest of the world imagines—a cup (or commonly a mug) of tea is something drunk frequently throughout the day. This is not to say that the British do not have a more formal tea ceremony, but tea breaks are an essential part of the working day. The term is often shortened to 'tea', essentially indicating a break. This term was exported to the game of cricket and consequently to most other countries of the former British Empire.\n\nHistory\n\nThe popularity of tea dates back to the 19th century when India was part of the British Empire, and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. It was, however, first introduced in the UK by the Portuguese Catherine of Braganza, queen consort of Charles II in the 1660s and 1670s. As tea spread throughout the United Kingdom and through the social classes, tea gardens and tea dances developed. These would include watching fireworks or a dinner party and dance, concluding with an evening tea. The tea gardens lost value after World War II but tea dances are still held today in the UK.\n\nSome scholars suggest that tea played a role in the Industrial Revolution. Afternoon tea possibly became a way to increase the number of hours labourers could work in factories; the stimulants in the tea, accompanied by sugary snacks, would give workers energy to finish out the day's work. Further, tea helped alleviate some of the consequences of the urbanisation that accompanied the industrial revolution: drinking tea required boiling one's water, thereby killing water-borne diseases like dysentery, cholera, and typhoid.\n\nTea as a meal\nIn the United Kingdom \"tea\" is not only the name of the beverage, but also the name of a meal. The kind of meal that a person means depends very much on their social background and where they live. The differentiation in usage between dinner, supper, lunch and tea is one of the classic social markers of British English (see U and non-U English).\n\nCommonwealth countries\n\nAfternoon tea and its variants are the best known \"tea ceremony\" in the Commonwealth countries, available in homes and commercial establishments. In some varieties of English, \"tea\" refers to a savoury meal. Taiwanese bubble tea, known locally as pearl milk tea, has become widely popular in urban Australia and New Zealand, with multiple chains in every major city.\n\nIn Canada, various types of tea are used by many different indigenous tribes as healing and ceremonial medicines. For example, Ojibwe and Cree tribes in Ontario use Cedar Tea during sweat lodge ceremonies to cleanse and nourish their bodies. When European settlers arrived on North American shores, it was the indigenous people that taught them to make pine needle tea to help cure their scurvy; pine needles are a great source of vitamin C.\n\nTea remains a popular hot drink among Canadians of European (especially British and Irish) heritage. Black orange pekoe tea and other breakfast style teas may be drunk with the morning meal or as a part of a mid-morning or afternoon break. These types of teas are typically served with milk and sugar. Red Rose and King Cole are some of the more well-known Canadian brands of tea, and the Tim Hortons chain of cafés serves their ready-to-drink hot “steeped tea”, a strong breakfast-style tea. Cookies, tea biscuits or scones, and other pastries may accompany any tea that is served, but formal “afternoon tea\" in the British tradition is typically confined to tourist destinations, such as Victoria’s Empress Hotel or Toronto’s Royal York Hotel.\n\nIn the United States, tea can typically be served at all meals as an alternative to coffee, when served hot, or soft drinks, when served iced. Tea is also consumed throughout the day as a beverage. Afternoon tea, the meal done in the English tradition, is rarely served in the United States, although it remains romanticized by small children; it is usually reserved for special occasions like tea parties. \n\nRather than drinking tea hot, many Americans prefer tea served with ice. In fact, in the United States, about 80% of the tea consumed is served cold, or \"iced\". Iced tea has become an iconic symbol of the Southern United States and Southern hospitality, often appearing alongside summer barbecue cooking or grilled foods. Iced tea is often made as sweet tea, which is simply iced tea with copious amounts of sugar or sweetener.\n\nIced tea can be purchased like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores. This pre-made tea is usually sweetened. Sometimes some other flavorings, such as lemon or raspberry, are added. Many restaurants dispense iced tea brewed throughout the day from upright containers. \n\nDecaffeinated tea is widely available in the United States, for those who wish to reduce the physiological effects of caffeine.\n\nBefore World War II, the US preference for tea was equally split between green tea and black tea, 40% and 40%, with the remaining 20% preferring oolong tea. The war cut off the United States from its primary sources of green tea, China and Japan, leaving it with tea almost exclusively from British-controlled India, which produced black tea. After the war, nearly 99% of tea consumed was black tea. \"Green\", \"oolong\", and \"white\" teas have recently become more popular again, and are often touted as health foods.\n\nFast food coffee chains have made a huge impact on how Americans are exposed to herbal and exotic teas. Once considered a rarity, \"chai\", based on Indian \"masala chai\", has actually become a popular option for people who might drink a caffè latte. Although not as commercialized, Taiwanese-style Bubble tea has also become popular in the United States in recent years, often served in small local cafes in the same style as many coffee drinks.\n\nWhile Argentina is mainly a coffee culture due to its roots in Spain and Italy, Argentina shares in the unique mate culture of the Rioplatense region. Argentines are known for carrying around a bombilla, or gourd, to share mate with friends, family, and strangers throughout the day.\n\nBrazilian tea culture has its origins with the infused beverages, or \"chás\" (), made by the indigenous cultures of the Amazon region. It has evolved since the Portuguese colonial period to include imported varieties and tea-drinking customs. There is a folk knowledge in Brazil which says that Brazilians, mainly the urban ones, have a greater taste for using sugar in teas than in other cultures due to the lack of habit to unsweetened drinks.\n\nChilean tea consumption per capita ranks amongst the highest in the world, and is by far the highest within Latin America. Chile's tea culture draws back to both English immigration and the general Anglophilia within the Chilean elites during the 19th century, with consumption of the drink spreading quickly among all social classes as inexpensive alternatives reached the market. Besides black and green tea, Chileans often store herbal infusions, such as chamomile and matico. Although there isn't a fixed moment of the day for tea consumption (it being a common breakfast alternative to coffee, and also a regular after-lunch staple), it is most commonly associated with the late afternoon meal of the \"once\" (lit. 'elevenses' in Spanish, though contrary to most variations of the meal it is not a morning snack), which most Chileans report as having instead of dinner.\n\n"}

The island covers an area of and has 185 inhabitants.\n\nEndelave and its surrounding seaside is important for many birds, both on domestic and international levels and it is therefore a Ramsar area. The Ramsar protection is part of the Ramsar protection in Horsens Fjord and has number 152. The total area of the entire protection encompass 42,737 ha. The reef 'Møllegrunden' Northwest of the island is an important resting and breeding site for many seals in the Kattegat sea. The bay of Endelave is comprised by a large intertidal zone similar to the wadden sea area. About ⅓ of the island itself is protected under the Natura 2000 plan, housing vulnerable and outstanding nature-types such as a heather moorland thicket, a beach-meadow and oak forests for example.\n\nEndelave is home to a population of wild rabbits of variable size. It is a locally distributed animal in Denmark, but where it is found the population is usually large. The rabbits on Endelave are hunted when in season and in the last few years, more than half of the total rabbit bag in Denmark (a stable level of 5000 animal pro anno), was from Endelave.\n\n"}
{"id": "1866767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866767", "title": "Congo Basin", "text": "Congo Basin\n\nThe Congo Basin is the sedimentary basin of the Congo River. The Congo Basin is located in Central Africa, in a region known as west equatorial Africa. The Congo Basin region is sometimes known simply as the Congo.\n\nThe basin begins in the highlands of the East African Rift system with input from the Chambeshi River, the Uele and Ubangi Rivers in the upper reaches and the Lualaba River draining wetlands in the middle reaches. Due to the young age and active uplift of the East African Rift at the headlands, the river's yearly sediment load is very large but the drainage basin occupies large areas of low relief throughout much of its area. The basin is a total of 3.7 million square kilometers and is home to some of the largest undisturbed stands of tropical rainforest on the planet, in addition to large wetlands. The basin ends where the river empties its load in the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean. The climate is equatorial tropical, with two rainy seasons including very high rainfalls, and high temperature year round. The basin is home to the endangered western lowland gorilla.\n\nThe basin was the watershed of the Congo River populated by pygmy peoples, and eventually Bantu peoples migrated there and founded the Kingdom of Kongo. Belgium, France, and Portugal later established colonial control over the entire region by the late 19th century. The General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 gave a precise definition to the \"conventional basin\" of the Congo, which included the entire actual basin plus some other areas. The General Act bound its signatories to neutrality within the conventional basin, but this was not respected during the First World War.\n\nCongo is a traditional name for the equatorial Middle Africa that lies between the Gulf of Guinea and the African Great Lakes. It contains some of the largest tropical rainforests in the world.\nCountries wholly or partially in the Congo region:\n\nThe Congo forest is an important biodiversity hotspot. It is home to okapi, bonobo and the Congo peafowl, but is also an important source of African teak, used for building furniture and flooring. An estimated 40 million people depend on these woodlands, surviving on traditional livelihoods. At a global level, Congo's forests act as the planet's second lung, counterpart to the rapidly dwindling Amazon. They are a huge \"carbon sink,\" trapping carbon that could otherwise become carbon dioxide. The Congo Basin holds roughly 8 percent of the world's forest-based carbon. These forests also affect rainfall across the North Atlantic. In other words, these forests are crucial to the future of climate stability, a bulwark against runaway climate change.\n\nA moratorium on logging in the Congo forest was agreed with the World Bank and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC, République Démocratique du Congo) in May 2002. The World Bank agreed to provide $90 million of development aid to RDC with the proviso that the government did not issue any new concessions granting logging companies rights to exploit the forest. The deal also prohibited the renewal of existing concessions.\n\nGreenpeace is calling on the World Bank to \"think outside the box\" and use the forest's potential in the battle against climate change. If these woodlands are deforested, the carbon they trap will be released into the atmosphere. It says that 8% of the Earth's forest-based carbon is stored in the RDC's forests. Predictions for future unabated deforestation estimate that by 2050 activities in the DRC will release roughly the same amount of carbon dioxide as the United Kingdom has emitted over the last 60 years.\n\nThe government has written a new forestry code that requires companies to invest in local development and follow a sustainable, twenty-five-year cycle of rotational logging. When a company is granted a concession from central government to log in Congo, it must sign an agreement with the local chiefs and hereditary land owners, who give permission for it to extract the trees in return for development packages. In theory, the companies must pay government nearly $18m rent a year for these concessions, of which 40% in taxes paid should be returned to provincial governments for investment in social development of the local population in the logged areas.\n\nIn its current form, the Kyoto Protocol does not reward so-called \"avoided deforestation\"—initiatives that protect forest from being cut down. But many climate scientists and policymakers hope that negotiations for Kyoto's successor will include such measures. If this were the case, there could be a financial incentive for protecting forests.\n\nL’Île Mbiye in Kisangani is part of the Sustainable Forest Management in Africa Symposium project of forest ecosystem conservation conducted by Stellenbosch University. RDC is also looking to expand the area of forest under protection, for which it hopes to secure compensation through emerging markets for forest carbon.\n\nThe main Congolese environmental organization working to save the forests is an NGO called OCEAN, which serves as the link between international outfits like Greenpeace and local community groups in the concessions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866771", "title": "Alicia Webb", "text": "Alicia Webb\n\nAlicia Nicole Webb (born May 4, 1979) is an American professional wrestling valet. She is perhaps best known for her time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) during 1999 as Ryan Shamrock. She is also known as Alicia Webb while she appeared on the Independent circuit.\n\nWebb was hired by the World Wrestling Federation to make a one night appearance initially as a model. On January 11, 1999, Alicia debuted on \"Raw\" as \"Ryan Shamrock\", the kayfabe younger sister of Ken Shamrock. Val Venis flirted with her at ringside before his match, which led to Ken Shamrock running out and viciously attacking Venis, warning him to stay away from her. After giving Venis a beating, Billy Gunn appeared at the ring and flirtatiously mooned Ryan. Ken then went after Gunn, challenging him to an Intercontinental title match at the Royal Rumble.\n\nOn January 25, Ryan was officially introduced to the viewers by Val Venis. It was revealed that she had starred with Venis in the fictional pornographic film \"Shaving Ryan's Privates\". At St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Ryan slapped Ken across the face, which caused him to lose his match to Venis. On February 13, Ken Shamrock viciously attacked Val Venis and the WWF referees during an interview. On February 15, Ryan helped Venis win his match after she was accidentally knocked off the apron only to be dumped by Venis following. That same night backstage, Billy Gunn tried consoling Ryan only to be attacked from behind by Ken. On March 1, Ryan came down to the ring during a match involving Venis, Shamrock and Goldust and was kissed by Goldust afterwards.\n\nOn March 8, Ryan managed Goldust in a match against Ken. At Wrestlemania 15, Ryan and The Blue Meanie were in Goldust's corner for the Fatal Four Way match for the Intercontinental Championship, which Road Dogg retained. \nOn the April 5 episode of \"Raw\", The Undertaker and his disciples decided to sacrifice Ryan as a way of sending a message to Stephanie McMahon and Vince McMahon. The next week on April 12, Ryan was found by Mankind in the boiler room. Later in the night, The Undertaker revealed to Ken that Ryan was in the boiler room. As Ken found Ryan whom was being consoled by Mankind, they were attacked by the Ministry of Darkness and after The Undertaker grabbed her by the hair and called her \"a little slut\".\n\nHaving disappeared from the WWF for over a month, Ryan returned on the May 16, episode \"WWF Heat\", distracting Droz during a tag team match, causing a loss against The Brood. Ryan then joined the Pretty Mean Sisters (PMS) stable with Terri Runnels and Jacqueline. She was depicted as a heel alongside Terri Runnels and Jacqueline Moore. On an episode of RAW, GTV revealed footage of the Pretty Mean Sisters in the locker room wearing towels. After being with PMS for three months, Webb was released from the WWF in July 1999.\n\nWebb later claimed that she was released because she refused to sign a five-year contract with the company. Other accusations were that Joanie Laurer had hated her and messed up some of her things in the locker room most of the time. There were plans apparently by Vince McMahon to do an incest angle between Webb and Ken Shamrock, whom she was dating in real life at the time.\n\nWebb later debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on their \"Nitro\" show as \"Symphony\", the valet of The Maestro late in 1999. She was depicted as being \"very nice\" and also grew flowers and roses. On December 23, 1999, Symphony, Madusa and Spice were in a promo with Evan Karagias to show how women \"act\".\nOn February 21, 2000, Symphony turned down a date from Buff Bagwell. After managing the Maestro for five months, the Maestro was released from WCW. In August 2000, Webb was also released from WCW.\n\nShe made her debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as \"Aleesha\". Following this, Webb began to appear as a talent scout, appearing on the ramp and accepting money from various wrestlers. The storyline didn't go anywhere and Webb left the promotion shortly thereafter.\n\nIn May 2007, she began working with the Mexican promotion AAA while managing X-Pac, whom she also dated during this time. While managing X-Pac, Webb also became a part of La Legión Extranjera until sometime in 2009.\n\nWebb made her debut for the National Wrestling Alliance as Ryan Shamrock, competing in an Evening Gown match against Bobcat on October 30, 1999. She then wrestled on the Independent circuit against wrestlers such as Nicole Bass, Kara Slice, and Taylor Matheny as well as managing Ken Shamrock. On August 17, 2013, Webb managed Daivari in a match where he lost to Matt Hardy, who was managed by Reby Sky.\nWebb was married to Marcello DelGrosso. Webb has a son who was born in 2003, named Phoenix.\n\n"}
