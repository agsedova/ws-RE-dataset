In the context of eldercare, independent living is seen as a step in the continuum of care, with assisted living being the next step.\n\nIn most countries, proponents of the IL Movement claim preconceived notions and a predominantly medical view of disability contribute to negative attitudes towards people with disabilities, portraying them as sick, defective and deviant persons, as objects of professional intervention, or as a burden for themselves and their families. These images have consequences for disabled people's opportunities for raising families of their own, getting education and work, which may result in persons with disabilities living in poverty. With the rise in Senior population, Independent Living facilities have risen in popularity as an option for aging citizens.\n\nThe Independent Living Movement grew out of the disability rights movement, which began in the 1960s. The IL Movement works at replacing the special education and rehabilitation experts' concepts of integration, normalization and rehabilitation with a new paradigm developed by people with disabilities themselves. The first Independent Living ideologists and organizers were people with extensive disabilities (e.g., Ed Roberts, Judith Heumann, Peg Nosek, Lex Frieden) and of course, early friends and collaborators in the 1970s (Julie Ann Racino) and university and government supporters throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Ed Roberts was a quadriplegic who dealt with discrimination in many different aspects of his life. His fight for acceptance in schools, however, is what Roberts is most well known for. In high school, Roberts was stopped from graduating because he could not complete his gym requirement, as he was paralyzed and spent most of his time in an iron lung. His biggest educational challenge came when he was accepted at college. After struggling to get accepted, the UCBerkeley refused to give Roberts financial aid. He then sued Berkeley for access and integration. Although he won the case, Roberts was housed in school's infirmary instead of the dorms. As others with disabilities started attending the school and living in the infirmary, an activist group called the Rolling Quads was formed. They ended up starting the Disabled Students' Program, a resource for those with disabilities that was run by people with disabilities. This program led to the first independent living center in America being made, the Berkeley Center for Independent Living. These centers flourished across the United States and are a huge part of why Ed Roberts was so instrumental in the start of the Independent Living Movement. Still, the movement's message seems most popular among people whose lives depend on assistance with the activities of daily living and who, in the view of the IL Movement, are most exposed to custodial care, paternalistic attitudes and control by professionals. In 2015, independent living centers are codified in law throughout the US, and offer a variety of \"professional services\" (i.e., independent living) under government payment structures in the US.\n\nThe Independent Living philosophy postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the Independent Living ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the IL Movement regardless of diagnoses).\n\nIn the Independent Living philosophy, people with disabilities are primarily seen as citizens and only secondarily as consumers of healthcare, rehabilitation or social services. As citizens in democratic societies, the IL Movement claims, persons with disabilities have the same right to participation, to the same range of options, degree of freedom, control and self-determination in everyday life and life projects that other citizens take for granted. Thus, IL activists demand the removal of infrastructural, institutional and attitudinal barriers and the adoption of the Universal Design principle. Depending on the individual's disability, support services such as assistive technology, income supplements or personal assistance are seen as necessary to achieve equal opportunities. As emphasized by the IL Movement, needs assessment and service delivery must enable users to control their services, to freely choose among competing service providers and to live with dignity in the community. Cash benefits or Direct Payments are favored by IL activists over services in kind in terms of the outcomes for users' quality of life and cost-efficiency.\n\nOver the years, the IL Movement has spread from North America to all continents, adapting itself to and getting enriched by different cultures and economic conditions in the process. A considerable body of research, training materials and examples of good practice exists on such themes as transition from institutional to community living, transition from school to employment or self-employment, community organizing and advocacy, disability culture, girls and women with disabilities as well as disability and development. Supporting the movement and utilizing its work has become an important ingredient of many countries' social policy.\n\n\"Independent Living does not mean that we want to do everything by ourselves, do not need anybody or like to live in isolation. Independent Living means that we demand the same choices and control in our every-day lives that our non-disabled brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends take for granted. We want to grow up in our families, go to the neighborhood school, use the same bus as our neighbors, work in jobs that are in line with our education and interests, and raise families of our own. We are profoundly ordinary people sharing the same need to feel included, recognized and loved.\"\n\nIn the 1970s/1980s, in Germany, the autonomous disability rights movement, also called the cripples movement, claimed for themselves the word \"cripple\" in the sense of a reappropriation.The \"cripple tribunal\" in Dortmund on 13 December 1981 was one of the main protest actions of the autonomous German disability movement (in confrontation with the established disability assistance) against human rights abuses in Nursing homes and Psychiatric hospitals, and as well against deficiencies of the local public-transport. \nAnalogous to the Russell Tribunal by Amnesty International, the \"cripple tribunal\" has denounced human rights violations of disabled people.\n\nIn 1989 over 80 disabled persons and supporters coming from the Independent Living movement gathered in Strasbourg, France for a conference on personal assistance. The conference was funded by the German Green party and was an opportunity for members of the Independent Living movement to meet. This meeting resulted in the founding of ENIL – The European Network on Independent Living. This network includes members from the European Union and its neighbors. ENIL promotes Independent Living at the European level but also at national and regional levels.\n\nIn 1972, the first Center for Independent Living was founded by disability activists, led by Ed Roberts, in Berkeley, California. These Centers were created to offer peer support and role modeling, and are run and controlled by persons with disabilities. According to the IL approach, the example of a peer, somebody who has been in a similar situation, can be more powerful than a non-disabled professional's interventions in analyzing one's situation, in assuming responsibility for one's life and in developing coping strategies.\n\nAccording to the IL Movement, with peer support, everyone – including persons with extensive developmental disabilities – can learn to take more initiative and control over their lives. For example, peer support is used in Independent Living Skills classes where people living with their families or in institutions learn how to run their everyday lives in preparation for living by themselves.\n\nThere is a fundamental set of services (Core Services) found in all of the Centers, but there is some variation in the programs that are offered, the funding sources, and the staffing, among other things. Depending on the public services in the community, Centers might assist with housing referral and adaptation, personal assistance referral, or legal aid. Typically, Centers work with local and regional governments to improve infrastructure, raise awareness about disability issues and lobby for and prohibits discrimination. Effective centers have proven to be in states like California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.\n\n\n"}

Frobenius algebras began to be studied in the 1930s by Brauer and Nesbitt and were named after Frobenius. Nakayama discovered the beginnings of a rich duality theory , . Dieudonné used this to characterize Frobenius algebras . Frobenius algebras were generalized to quasi-Frobenius rings, those Noetherian rings whose right regular representation is injective. In recent times, interest has been renewed in Frobenius algebras due to connections to topological quantum field theory.\n\nA finite-dimensional, unital, associative algebra \"A\" defined over a field \"k\" is said to be a Frobenius algebra if \"A\" is equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form σ:\"A\" × \"A\" → \"k\" that satisfies the following equation: \"σ\"(\"a\"·\"b\",\"c\")=\"σ\"(\"a\",\"b\"·\"c\"). This bilinear form is called the Frobenius form of the algebra.\n\nEquivalently, one may equip \"A\" with a linear functional \"λ\" : \"A\" → \"k\" such that the kernel of \"λ\" contains no nonzero left ideal of \"A\".\n\nA Frobenius algebra is called symmetric if \"σ\" is symmetric, or equivalently \"λ\" satisfies \"λ\"(\"a\"·\"b\") = \"λ\"(\"b\"·\"a\").\n\nThere is also a different, mostly unrelated notion of the symmetric algebra of a vector space.\n\n\n\nIn category theory, the notion of Frobenius object is an abstract definition of a Frobenius algebra in a category. A Frobenius object formula_1 in a monoidal category formula_2 consists of an object \"A\" of \"C\" together with four morphisms\n\nsuch that\n\nand\ncommute (for simplicity the diagrams are given here in the case where the monoidal category \"C\" is strict) and are known as Frobenius conditions.\n\nMore compactly, a Frobenius algebra in C is a so-called Frobenius monoidal functor A:1 → C, where 1 is the category consisting of one object and one arrow.\n\nA Frobenius algebra is called isometric or special if formula_6.\n\nFrobenius algebras originally were studied as part of an investigation into the representation theory of finite groups, and have contributed to the study of number theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. They have been used to study Hopf algebras, coding theory, and cohomology rings of compact oriented manifolds.\n\nRecently, it has been seen that they play an important role in the algebraic treatment and axiomatic foundation of topological quantum field theory. A commutative Frobenius algebra determines uniquely (up to isomorphism) a (1+1)-dimensional TQFT. More precisely, the category of commutative Frobenius \"K\"-algebras is equivalent to the category of symmetric strong monoidal functors from 2-Cob (the category of 2-dimensional cobordisms between 1-dimensional manifolds) to Vect (the category of vector spaces over \"K\").\n\nThe correspondence between TQFTs and Frobenius algebras is given as follows:\n\nThis relation between Frobenius-algebras and (1+1)-dimensional TQFTs can be used to explain the Khovanov's categorification of the Jones polynomial.\n\nLet \"B\" be a subring sharing the identity element of a unital associative ring \"A\". This is also known as ring extension \"A\" | \"B\". Such a ring extension is called Frobenius if\n\n\nThe map \"E\" is sometimes referred to as a Frobenius homomorphism and the elements formula_10 as dual bases. (As an exercise it is possible to give an equivalent definition of Frobenius extension as a Frobenius algebra-coalgebra object in the category of \"B\"-\"B\"-bimodules, where the equations just given become the counit equations for the counit \"E\".)\n\nFor example, a Frobenius algebra \"A\" over a commutative ring \"K\", with associative nondegenerate bilinear form (-,-) and projective K-bases formula_11 is a Frobenius extension \"A\" | \"K\" with \"E(a)\" = (\"a\",1). Other examples of Frobenius extensions are pairs of group algebras associated to a subgroup of finite index, Hopf subalgebras of a semisimple Hopf algebra, Galois extensions and certain von Neumann algebra subfactors of finite index. Another source of examples of Frobenius extensions (and twisted versions) are certain subalgebra pairs of Frobenius algebras, where the subalgebra is stabilized by the symmetrizing automorphism of the overalgebra.\n\nThe details of the group ring example are the following application of elementary notions in group theory. Let \"G\" be a group and \"H\" a subgroup of finite index \"n\" in \"G\"; let \"g\", ..., \"g\". be left coset representatives, so that \"G\" is a disjoint union of the cosets \"g\"\"H\", ..., \"gH\". Over any commutative base ring k define the group algebras \"A\" = \"k[G]\" and \"B\" = \"k[H]\", so \"B\" is a subalgebra of \"A\". Define a Frobenius homomorphism \"E\": \"A\" → \"B\" by letting \"E(h)\" = \"h\" for all \"h\" in \"H\", and \"E(g)\" = 0 for \"g\" not in \"H\" : extend this linearly from the basis group elements to all of \"A\", so one obtains the \"B\"-\"B\"-bimodule projection\n\n(The orthonormality condition formula_13 follows.) The dual base is given by formula_14, since\n\nThe other dual base equation may be derived from the observation that G is also a disjoint union of the right cosets formula_16.\n\nAlso Hopf-Galois extensions are Frobenius extensions by a theorem of Kreimer and Takeuchi from 1989. A simple example of this is a finite group \"G\" acting by automorphisms on an algebra \"A\" with subalgebra of invariants:\n\nBy DeMeyer's criterion \"A\" is \"G\"-Galois over \"B\" if there are elements formula_18 in \"A\" satisfying:\n\nwhence also\n\nThen \"A\" is a Frobenius extension of \"B\" with \"E\": \"A\" → \"B\" defined by\n\nwhich satisfies\n\n(Furthermore, an example of a separable algebra extension since formula_23 is a separability element satisfying \"ea = ae\" for all \"a\" in \"A\" as well as formula_24. Also an example of a depth two subring (\"B\" in \"A\") since\n\nwhere\n\nfor each \"g\" in \"G\" and \"a\" in \"A\".)\n\nFrobenius extensions have a well-developed theory of induced representations investigated in papers by Kasch and Pareigis, Nakayama and Tzuzuku in the 1950s and 1960s. For example, for each \"B\"-module \"M\", the induced module \"A\" ⊗ \"M\" (if \"M\" is a left module) and co-induced module Hom(\"A, M\") are naturally isomorphic as \"A\"-modules (as an exercise one defines the isomorphism given \"E\" and dual bases). The endomorphism ring theorem of Kasch from 1960 states that if \"A\" | \"B\" is a Frobenius extension, then so is \"A\" → End(\"A\") where the mapping is given by \"a\" ↦ \"λ(x)\" and \"λ(x) = ax\" for each \"a,x\" ∈ \"A\". Endomorphism ring theorems and converses were investigated later by Mueller, Morita, Onodera and others.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814677", "title": "Plasmodesma", "text": "Plasmodesma\n\nPlasmodesmata (singular: plasmodesma) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells, enabling transport and communication between them. Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages, and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae, Charales, Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae (which are all algae), as well as all embryophytes, better known as land plants. Unlike animal cells, almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall. Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella, forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast. Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes, plasmodesmata enable direct, regulated, symplastic transport of substances between cells. There are two forms of plasmodesmata: primary plasmodesmata, which are formed during cell division, and secondary plasmodesmata, which can form between mature cells.\n\nSimilar structures, called gap junctions and membrane nanotubes, interconnect animal cells and stromules form between plastids in plant cells.\n\nPrimary plasmodesmata are formed when fractions of the endoplasmic reticulum are trapped across the middle lamella as new cell wall are synthesized between two newly divided plant cells. These eventually become the cytoplasmic connections between cells. At the formation site, the wall is not thickened further, and depressions or thin areas known as pits are formed in the walls. Pits normally pair up between adjacent cells. Plasmodesmata can also be inserted into existing cell walls between non-dividing cells (secondary plasmodesmata).\n\nThe formation of primary plasmodesmata occurs during the part of the cellular division process where the endoplasmic reticulum and the new plate are fused together, this process results in the formation of a cytoplasmic pore (or cytoplasmic sleeve). The desmotubule, also known as the appressed ER, forms alongside the cortical ER. Both the appressed ER and the cortical ER are packed tightly together, thus leaving no room for any luminal space. It is proposed that the appressed ER acts as a membrane transportation route in the plasmodesmata. When filaments of the cortical ER are entangled in the formation of a new cell plate, plasmodesmata formation occurs in land plants. It is hypothesized that the appressed ER forms due to a combination of pressure from a growing cell wall and interaction from ER and PM proteins. Primary plasmodesmata are often present in areas where the cell walls appear to be thinner. This is due to the fact that as a cell wall expands, the abundance of the primary plasmodesmata decreases. In order to further expand plasmodesmal density during cell wall growth secondary plasmodesmata are produced. The process of secondary plasmodesmata formation is still to be fully understood, however various degrading enzymes and ER proteins are said to stimulate the process.\n\nA typical plant cell may have between 10 and 10 plasmodesmata connecting it with adjacent cells equating to between 1 and 10 per µm. Plasmodesmata are approximately 50–60 nm in diameter at the midpoint and are constructed of three main layers, the plasma membrane, the \"cytoplasmic sleeve\", and the \"desmotubule\". They can transverse cell walls that are up to 90 nm thick.\n\nThe plasma membrane portion of the plasmodesma is a continuous extension of the cell membrane or plasmalemma and has a similar phospholipid bilayer structure.\n\nThe cytoplasmic sleeve is a fluid-filled space enclosed by the plasmalemma and is a continuous extension of the cytosol. Trafficking of molecules and ions through plasmodesmata occurs through this space. Smaller molecules (e.g. sugars and amino acids) and ions can easily pass through plasmodesmata by diffusion without the need for additional chemical energy. Larger molecules, including proteins (for example green fluorescent protein) and RNA, can also pass through the cytoplasmic sleeve diffusively. Plasmodesmatal transport of some larger molecules is facilitated by mechanisms that are currently unknown. One mechanism of regulation of the permeability of plasmodesmata is the accumulation of the polysaccharide callose around the neck region to form a collar, thereby reducing the diameter of the pore available for transport of substances. Through dilation, active gating or structural remodeling the permeability of the plasmodesmata is increased. This increase in plasmodesmata pore permeability allows for larger molecules, or macromolecules, such as signaling molecules, transcription factors and RNA-protein complexes to be transported to various cellular compartments.\n\nThe desmotubule is a tube of appressed (flattened) endoplasmic reticulum that runs between two adjacent cells. Some molecules are known to be transported through this channel, but it is not thought to be the main route for plasmodesmatal transport.\n\nAround the desmotubule and the plasma membrane areas of an electron dense material have been seen, often joined together by spoke-like structures that seem to split the plasmodesma into smaller channels. These structures may be composed of myosin and actin, which are part of the cell's cytoskeleton. If this is the case these proteins could be used in the selective transport of large molecules between the two cells.\n\nPlasmodesmata have been shown to transport proteins (including transcription factors), short interfering RNA, messenger RNA, viroids, and viral genomes from cell to cell. One example of a viral movement proteins is the tobacco mosaic virus MP-30. MP-30 is thought to bind to the virus's own genome and shuttle it from infected cells to uninfected cells through plasmodesmata. Flowering Locus T protein moves from leaves to the shoot apical meristem through plasmodesmata to initiate flowering.\n\nPlasmodesmata are also used by cells in phloem, and symplastic transport is used to regulate the sieve-tube cells by the companion cells.\n\nThe size of molecules that can pass through plasmodesmata is determined by the size exclusion limit. This limit is highly variable and is subject to active modification. For example, MP-30 is able to increase the size exclusion limit from 700 Daltons to 9400 Daltons thereby aiding its movement through a plant. Also, increasing calcium concentrations in the cytoplasm, either by injection or by cold-induction, has been shown to constrict the opening of surrounding plasmodesmata and limit transport.\n\nSeveral models for possible active transport through plasmodesmata exist. It has been suggested that such transport is mediated by interactions with proteins localized on the desmotubule, and/or by chaperones partially unfolding proteins, allowing them to fit through the narrow passage. A similar mechanism may be involved in transporting viral nucleic acids through the plasmodesmata.\n\nPlasmodesmata link almost every cell within a plant, which can cause negative effects such as the spread of viruses. In order to understand this we must first look at cytoskeletal components, such as actin microfilaments, microtubules, and myosin proteins, and how they are related to cell to cell transport. Actin microfilaments are linked to the transport of viral movement proteins to plasmodesmata which allow for cell to cell transport through the plasmodesmata. Fluorescent tagging for co-expression in tobacco leaves showed that actin filaments are responsible for transporting viral movement proteins to the plasmodesmata. When actin polymerization was blocked it caused a decrease in plasmodesmata targeting of the movement proteins in the tobacco and allowed for 10-kDa (rather than 126-kDa) components to move between tobacco mesophyll cells. This also impacted cell to cell movement of molecules within the tobacco plant.\n\nViruses break down actin filaments within the plasmodesmata channel in order to move within the plant. For example, when the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) gets into plants it is able to travel through almost every cell through utilization of viral movement proteins to transport themselves through the plasmodesmata. When tobacco leaves are treated with a drug that stabilizes actin filaments, phalloidin, the cucumber mosaic virus movement proteins are unable to increase the plasmodesmata size exclusion limit (SEL).\n\nHigh amounts of myosin proteins are found at the sites of plasmodesmata. These proteins are involved in directing viral cargoes to plasmodesmata. When mutant forms of myosin were tested in tobacco plants, viral protein targeting to plasmodesmata was negatively affected. Permanent binding of myosin to actin, which was induced by a drug, caused a decrease in cell to cell movement. Viruses are also able to selectively bind to myosin proteins.\n\nMicrotubules are also are also an important role in cell to cell transport of viral RNA. Viruses use many different methods of transporting themselves from cell to cell, and one of those methods associating the N-terminal domain of its RNA to localize to plasmodesmata through microtubules. Tobacco plants injected with tobacco movement viruses that were kept in high temperatures there was a strong correlation between TMV movement proteins that were attached to GFP with microtubules. This led to an increase in the spread of viral RNA through the tobacco.\n\nPlasmodesmata regulation and structure are regulated by a beta 1,3-glucan polymer known as callose. Callose is found in cell plates during the process of cytokinesis, as this process reaches completion the levels of calls decrease. The only callose rich parts of the cell include the sections of the cell wall that plasmodesmata are present. In order to regulate what is transported in the plasmodesmata, callose must be present. Callose provides the mechanism in which plasmodesmata permeability is regulated. In order to control what is transported between different tissues, the plasmodesmata undergo several specialized conformational changes.\n\nThe activity of plasmodesmata are linked to physiological and developmental processes within plants. There is a hormone signaling pathway that relays primary cellular signals to the plasmodesmata. There are also patterns of environmental, physiological, and developmental cues that show relation to plasmodesmata function. An important mechanism of plasmodesmata is the ability to gate its channels. Callose levels have been proved to be a method of changing plasmodesmata aperture size. Callose deposits are found at the neck of the plasmodesmata in new cell walls that have been formed. The level of deposits at the plasmodesmata can fluctuate which shows that there are signals that trigger an accumulation of callose at the plasmodesmata and cause plasmodesmata to become gated or more open. Enzyme activities of Beta 1,3-glucan synthase and hydrolases are involved in changes in plasmodesmata cellulose level. Some extracellular signals change transcription of activities of this synthase and hydrolase. Arabidopsis thailana contain callose synthase genes that encode a catalytic subunit of B-1,3-glucan. Gain of function mutants in this gene pool show increased deposition of callose at plasmodesmata and a decrease in macromolecular trafficking as well as a defective root system during development.\n\n"}

Death masks may be mementos of the dead, or be used for creation of portraits. It is sometimes possible to identify portraits that have been painted from death masks, because of the characteristic slight distortions of the features caused by the weight of the plaster during the making of the mold.\n\nThe main purpose of the death mask from the Middle Ages until the 19th century was to serve as a model for sculptors in creating statues and busts of the deceased person. Not until the 1800s did such masks become valued for themselves.\n\nIn other cultures a death mask may be a funeral mask, an image placed on the face of the deceased before burial rites, and normally buried with them. The best known of these are the masks used in ancient Egypt as part of the mummification process, such as Tutankhamun's mask, and those from Mycenaean Greece such as the Mask of Agamemnon.\n\nIn some European countries, it was common for death masks to be used as part of the effigy of the deceased, displayed at state funerals; the coffin portrait was an alternative. Mourning portraits were also painted, showing the subject lying in repose. During the 18th and 19th centuries masks were also used to permanently record the features of unknown corpses for purposes of identification. This function was later replaced by post-mortem photography.\n\nIn the cases of people whose faces were damaged by their death, it was common to take casts of their hands. An example of this occurred in the case of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, the Canadian statesman whose face was shattered by the bullet which was used to assassinate him in 1868.\n\nWhen taken from a living subject, such a cast is called a life mask. Proponents of phrenology used both death masks and life masks for pseudoscientific purposes.\n\nMasks of deceased persons are part of traditions in many countries. The most important process of the funeral ceremony in ancient Egypt was the mummification of the body, which, after prayers and consecration, was put into a sarcophagus enameled and decorated with gold and gems. A special element of the rite was a sculpted mask, put on the face of the deceased. This mask was believed to strengthen the spirit of the mummy and guard the soul from evil spirits on its way to the afterworld. The best known mask is Tutankhamun's mask. Made of gold and gems, the mask conveys the highly stylized features of the ancient ruler. Such masks were not, however, made from casts of the features; rather, the mummification process itself preserved the features of the deceased.\n\nIn 1876 the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered in Mycenae six graves, which he was confident belonged to kings and ancient Greek heroes—Agamemnon, Cassandra, Evrimdon and their associates. To his surprise, the skulls were covered with gold masks. It is now thought most unlikely that the masks actually belonged to Agamemnon and other heroes of the Homeric epics; in fact they are several centuries older.\n\nThe lifelike character of Roman portrait sculptures has been attributed to the earlier Roman use of wax to preserve the features of deceased family members (the so-called \"imagines maiorum\"). The wax masks were subsequently reproduced in more durable stone.\n\nThe use of masks in the ancestor cult is also attested in Etruria. Excavations of tombs in the area of the ancient city of Clusium (modern Chiusi, Tuscany) have yielded a number of sheet-bronze masks dating from the Etruscan late orientalizing period. In the 19th century it was thought that they were related to the Mycenaean examples, but whether they served as actual death masks cannot be proven. The most credited hypothesis holds that they were originally fixed to cinerary urns, to give them a human appearance. In Orientalising Clusium, the anthropomorphization of urns was a prevalent phenomenon that was strongly rooted in local religious beliefs.\nIn the late Middle Ages, a shift took place from sculpted masks to true death masks, made of wax or plaster. These masks were not interred with the deceased. Instead, they were used in funeral ceremonies and were later kept in libraries, museums, and universities. Death masks were taken not only of deceased royalty and nobility (Henry VIII, Sforza), but also of eminent persons—composers, dramaturges, military and political leaders, philosophers, poets, and scientists, such as Dante Alighieri, Ludwig van Beethoven, Napoleon Bonaparte (whose death mask was taken on the island of Saint Helena), Filippo Brunelleschi, Frédéric Chopin, Oliver Cromwell (whose death mask is preserved at Warwick Castle), Joseph Haydn, John Keats, Franz Liszt, Blaise Pascal, Nikola Tesla (commissioned by his friend Hugo Gernsback and now displayed in the Nikola Tesla Museum), Torquato Tasso, and Voltaire. As in ancient Rome, death masks were often subsequently used in making marble sculpture portraits, busts, or engravings of the deceased.\n\nIn Russia, the death mask tradition dates back to the times of Peter the Great, whose death mask was taken by Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Also well known are the death masks of Nicholas I, and Alexander I. Stalin's death mask is on display at the Stalin Museum in Gori, Georgia.\n\nOne of the first real Ukrainian death masks was that of the poet Taras Shevchenko, taken by Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn early spring of 1860 and shortly before his death in April 1865, two life masks were created of President Abraham Lincoln.\nDeath masks were increasingly used by scientists from the late 18th century onwards to record variations in human physiognomy. The life mask was also increasingly common at this time, taken from living persons. Anthropologists used such masks to study physiognomic features in famous people and notorious criminals. Masks were also used to collect data on racial differences.\n\nBefore the widespread availability of photography, the facial features of unidentified bodies were sometimes preserved by creating death masks so that relatives of the deceased could recognize them if they were seeking a missing person.\n\nOne mask, known as L'Inconnue de la Seine, recorded the face of an unidentified young girl who, around the age of sixteen, according to one man's story, had been found drowned in the Seine River at Paris, France around the late 1880s. A morgue worker made a cast of her face, saying \"Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved.\" The cast was also compared to Mona Lisa, and other famous paintings and sculptures. Copies of the mask were fashionable in Parisian Bohemian society.\n\nThe face of Resusci Anne, the world's first CPR training mannequin, introduced in 1960, was modeled after \"L'Inconnue de la Seine\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1814700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814700", "title": "Intelligent designer", "text": "Intelligent designer\n\nAn intelligent designer, also referred to as an intelligent agent, is the hypothetical willed and self-aware entity that the intelligent design movement argues had some role in the origin and/or development of life. The term \"intelligent cause\" is also used, implying their teleological supposition of direction and purpose in features of the universe and of living things.\n\nThe popularly termed intelligent design movement is a neo-creationist campaign that arose out of the Christian fundamentalist creation science movement. Proponents of intelligent design argue to the public that their concept does not posit the identity of the designer as part of this effort, but in statements to their constituency, which consists largely of Christian conservatives, they identify the designer as God. The Discovery Institute has claimed that university criticism of intelligent design is tantamount to \"endorsement of an anti-religious view\"\n\nWilliam Dembski states in his book \"Design Inference\" that the nature of the intelligent designer cannot be inferred from intelligent design and suggests that the designer, if one is even necessary for design inference, may or may not be \"the God of Scripture.\" In December 2007 Dembski told Focus on the Family, \"I believe God created the world for a purpose. The Designer of intelligent design is, ultimately, the Christian God.\"\n\nSome leading intelligent design proponents have stated identifying or characterizing the designer is beyond the scope of intelligent design as a line of inquiry. Proponents had hoped that, by avoiding invoking creation by a specific supernatural entity, (such as that employed by creation science), intelligent design would be considered scientific and not violate the establishment clause of the US constitution. Proponents feared that were intelligent design identified as a restatement of previous forms of creationism, it would be precluded from being taught in public schools after the 1987 Supreme Court of the United States decision in \"Edwards vs Aguillard\". This line of reasoning was not particularly persuasive to most in the scientific community, which overwhelmingly rejected intelligent design as both a line of scientific inquiry and as a basis for a sound education in science.\n\nOn December 20, 2005 federal district court ruled in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" that intelligent design was not science and was essentially religious in nature. The ruling not only rendered that public school district's endorsement of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science classes unconstitutional\non the grounds that its inclusion violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, but validated the objections of critics who discounted proponents' claim that the identity was not God.\n\nHighlighting these mutually exclusive claims about the designer, Dembski, despite having said that the intelligent designer or designers could be any god or gods, or even space aliens, has also said that \"intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces\" and that \"Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory.\"\n\nMichael Behe, in his book Darwin's Black Box, suggested the designer might be a time traveling cell biologist.\n\nAt various times, leading proponents in the intelligent design movement have clearly expressed that they consider the Abrahamic God \"Elohim\" in his role as a creator God, to be the intelligent designer and denied that intelligent designer is God, depending on which audience they are addressing. One example is William Dembski, who on his blog in response to the question \"Is the designer responsible for biological complexity God?\" said \"not necessarily\" and \"To ask who or what is the designer of a particular object is to ask for the immediate intelligent agent responsible for its design. The point is that God is able to work through derived or surrogate intelligences, which can be anything from angels to organizing principles embedded in nature.\" Yet to the intelligent design movement's conservative Christian constituents Dembski has said \"intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces. This evidence is available to all apart from the special revelation of God in salvation history as recounted in Scripture. ... Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. This gives intelligent design incredible traction as a tool for apologetics, opening up the God-question to individuals who think that science has buried God\" and \"Thus, in its relation to Christianity, intelligent design should be viewed as a ground-clearing operation that gets rid of the intellectual rubbish that for generations has kept Christianity from receiving serious consideration.\" Stephen C. Meyer, founder and leader of the intelligent design program of the Discovery Institute admitted on national television he believes that the designer is God.\n\nPhillip E. Johnson, considered the father of the ID movement has stated the goal of the intelligent design movement:\nThe Discovery Institute's leaked Wedge document sets out the movement's governing goals, including:\nOpinion as to the amount of creation the intelligent designer has done varies within the ID movement. Michael Behe's concept of irreducible complexity has natural selection accounting for most of evolution but the intelligent designer contributing the design of some proteins. Others in the ID movement however contest concepts such as common descent, particularly of humans and other apes. Though most in the ID movement seem to be Old Earth Creationists, a few are Young Earth Creationists who believe in ex-nihilo.\n\nThe amount of creation that the intelligent designer did has also been criticised by Young Earth Creationists as not being specific enough, and particularly contradicting their beliefs of Biblical inerrancy and a young earth. Some intelligent design proponents say the intelligent designer fine-tuned the universe's physical constants in such a way that life is the result of the universe's physical constants being related to one another in a fashion that permits life to exist. The fine-tuned universe argument is a central premise or presented as a given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as William A. Dembski and Michael Behe.\n\nIntelligent design has been presented by its proponents as a \"big tent\" strategy into which several accounts of creation can fit. Were a \"scientific\" version of intelligent design approved for inclusion in public school science curricula, then a path would be opened for discussion of alternatives to not only natural selection but naturalism as well, and eventually religious accounts on the origin of life. The vast majority of scientists reject the concept of intelligent design and an intelligent designer. Instead, the most widely accepted explanation is that physical processes such as natural selection can account for the complexity of life and other phenomena and features of the universe. Attempts to insert theories of intelligent design into public school science curricula fits in with the intelligent design movement's social aims, via the overturning of Western secularism as detailed in the Wedge strategy. The concept of the intelligent designer has been criticised as a God-of-the-gaps argument. Introducing the hypothesis of an intelligent designer introduces the unsolved problem of accounting for the origin of such a designer (first cause).\n\nBy raising the question of the need for a designer for objects with irreducible complexity, intelligent design also raises the question, \"what designed the designer?\" Richard Dawkins has argued that \"If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the intelligent designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation,\" since such an answer would be unscientific. With religious creationism, the question \"what created God?\" can be answered with theological arguments, but in intelligent design, the chain of designers can be followed back indefinitely in an infinite regression, leaving the question of the creation of the first designer dangling. As a result, intelligent design does not explain how the complexity happened in the first place; it just moves it.\n\nElliott Sober says that by intelligent design's own arguments, a designer capable of creating irreducible complexity must also be irreducibly complex: \"Any mind in nature that designs and builds an irreducibly complex system is itself irreducibly complex\" Sober says that this an argument that intelligent design proponents still need to respond to.\n\nIf intelligent design proponents invoke an uncaused causer or deity to resolve this problem, they contradict a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that design requires a designer and reduce intelligent design to religious creationism. Another possible counter-argument might be an infinite regression of designers. However, admitting infinite numbers of objects also allows any arbitrarily improbable event to occur, such as an object with \"specific\" complexity assembling itself by chance. Again, this contradicts a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that a designer is needed for every specifically complex object, producing a logical contradiction.\n\nCritics contend the claim that positing a designer which explains gaps in our understanding yet does not need to be itself explained as not a contribution to knowledge but as a thought-terminating cliché.\n\nIn 2005, intelligent design proponents arguments regarding the identity of a designer became an issue considered by the court in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", the \"Dover trial,\" where plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution as an \"explanation of the origin of life\" thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his ruling, the judge, John E. Jones III, stated\nJones also commented that the appearance of design is subjective:\n\nThe judge ruled that \"ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\" and \"that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.\"\n\n\n"}

His contributions include the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality, which is important in the solution of the elliptic partial differential equations that arise in many areas of mathematics, and the formalization of the bounded mean oscillation known as John–Nirenberg space, which is used to study the behavior of both elastic materials and games of chance known as martingales. His other achievements include the solution to long-standing problems of Weyl and Minkowski, relating to the embedding of a 2-sphere and curvature, respectively; the theory of pseudo-differential operators initiated along with Joseph J. Kohn, the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem of complex structures, Vanishing Mean Oscillation (VMO),\nthe symmetries of solutions of PDEs along with Gidas and Ni, among many others.\n\nNirenberg's work on PDEs has been described as \"about the best that's been done\" (as of 2002) towards solving the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem of fluid mechanics, which is a Millennium Prize Problem.\n\nNirenberg was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and attended Baron Byng High School. He studied as an undergraduate at McGill University, completing there his B.S. in both mathematics and physics in 1945. He obtained his doctorate from New York University in 1949 under the direction of James Stoker. He subsequently became a professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. He was also conferred the degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa, at the University of British Columbia in 2010.\n\nHe received many honours and awards, including the Bôcher Memorial Prize (1959), the\nJeffery–Williams Prize (1987), the Steele Prize (1994 and 2014), the National Medal of Science (1995), and was the inaugural recipient of both the Crafoord Prize (1982, shared with Vladimir Arnold) and the Chern Medal (2010). In 2015 he was awarded the Abel Prize along with John Nash. He was a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\n\nOn 26 January 2020, it was announced that Nirenberg had died age 94.\n\nNirenberg's thesis provided a solution of the Weyl problem and Minkowski problem of differential geometry. The former asks for the existence of isometric embeddings of positively curved Riemannian metrics on \"S\" into ℝ, while the latter asks for closed surfaces in ℝ of prescribed Gaussian curvature. Nirenberg's work on these problems was later extended by Aleksei Pogorelov, Shiu-Yuen Cheng, and Shing-Tung Yau, among other authors. In a separate contribution to differential geometry, Nirenberg and Philip Hartman characterized the cylinders in Euclidean space as the only complete hypersurfaces which are intrinsically flat.\n\nWith Avron Douglis, Nirenberg extended the Schauder estimates, as discovered in the 1930s in the context of second-order elliptic equations, to general elliptic systems of arbitrary order. In collaboration with Douglis and Shmuel Agmon, Nirenberg extended these estimates up to the boundary. The Douglis-Nirenberg and Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg estimates are among the most widely-used tools in elliptic partial differential equations.\n\nIn 1957, answering a question posed to Nirenberg by André Weil, Nirenberg and August Newlander proved what is now known as the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, which provides a precise condition under which an almost complex structure arises from a holomorphic coordinate atlas. The Newlander-Nirenberg theorem is now considered as a foundational result in complex geometry, although the result is far better known than the proof, which is not usually covered in introductory texts, as it relies on advanced methods in partial differential equations.\n\nIn his 1959 survey on elliptic differential equations, Nirenberg proved (independently of Emilio Gagliardo) what is now known as the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequalities for the Sobolev spaces. A later work by Nirenberg, in 1966, clarified the possible exponents which can appear in these inequalities. More recent work by other authors has extended the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities to the fractional Sobolev spaces.\n\nImmediately following Fritz John's introduction of the BMO function space in the theory of elasticity, John and Nirenberg gave a further study of the space, with a particular functional inequality, now known as the John-Nirenberg inequality, which has become basic in the field of harmonic analysis. It characterizes how quickly a BMO function deviates from its average; the proof is a classic application of the Calderon-Zygmund decomposition.\n\nNirenberg and J.J. Kohn, following earlier work by Kohn, studied the formula_1-Neumann problem on pseudoconvex domains, and demonstrated the relation of the regularity theory to the existence of subelliptic estimates for the formula_1 operator.\n\nAgmon and Nirenberg made an extensive study of ordinary differential equations in Banach spaces, relating asymptotic representations and the behavior at infinity of solutions to\nto the spectral properties of the operator \"A\". Applications include the study of rather general parabolic and elliptic-parabolic problems.\n\nIn the 1960s, A.D. Aleksandrov introduced an elegant \"sliding plane\" reflection method, which he used to apply the maximum principle in proving that the only closed hypersurface of Euclidean space which has constant mean curvature is the round sphere. In collaboration with Basilis Gidas and Wei-Ming Ni, Nirenberg gave an extensive study of how this method applies to prove symmetry of solutions of certain symmetric second-order elliptic partial differential equations. A sample result is that if \"u\" is a positive function on a ball with zero boundary data and with Δ\"u\"+\"f\"(\"u\")=0 on the interior of the ball, then \"u\" is rotationally symmetric.\n\nNirenberg and Charles Loewner studied the means of naturally assigning a complete Riemannian metric to bounded open subsets of Euclidean space, modeled on the classical assignment of hyperbolic space to the unit ball, via the unit ball model. They showed that if Ω is a bounded open subset of R with smooth and strictly convex boundary, then the Monge-Ampère equation\nhas a unique smooth negative solution which extends continuously to zero boundary data; then formula_5 defines a complete Riemannian metic on Ω. This was later extended to higher dimensions in a well-known work of Cheng and Yau. Loewner and Nirenberg also studied the method of conformal deformation, via the Yamabe equation\nfor a constant \"c\". They showed that for certain Ω, this Yamabe equation has a unique solution which diverges to infinity at the boundary. The Riemannian metric formula_7 is then a complete Riemannian metric on Ω⊂ℝ. \n\nIn other work, Haïm Brezis, Guido Stampacchia, and Nirenberg gave an extension of Ky Fan's topological minimax principle to noncompact settings.\n\nBrezis and Nirenberg gave a study of the perturbation theory of nonlinear perturbations of noninvertible transformations between Hilbert spaces. Applications include existence results for periodic solutions of some semilinear wave equations.\n\nLuis Caffarelli, Robert Kohn, and Nirenberg studied the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, showing that weak solutions are smooth away from a set whose one-dimensional parabolic Hausdorff measure is zero. This is known as a \"partial regularity\" result. In his description of the regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations as a Millennium prize problem, Charles Fefferman refers to Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg's result as the most significant known result on the problem. Additionally, as a by-product of their work on the Navier-Stokes equations, Caffarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg (in a separate paper) extended Nirenberg's earlier work on the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality to weighted norms.\n\nIn collaboration with Caffarelli, J.J. Kohn, and Joel Spruck, Nirenberg advanced the understanding of the Dirichlet problem for general nonlinear elliptic equations of second order. The basic problem is to establish \"C\" control up to the boundary, which ensures uniform ellipticity. In a series of three papers, this was accomplished for the real and complex Monge-Ampère equations, and for somewhat general equations which are built out of the eigenvalues of the Hessian.\n\nIn one of Nirenberg's most widely cited papers, he and Brézis studied the Dirichlet problem for Yamabe-type equations on Euclidean spaces.\n\nThe moving plane method of Aleksandrov, as extended in 1979 by Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg, is studied further in joint works by Berestycki, Caffarelli, and Nirenberg. The primary theme is to understand when a solution of Δ\"u\"+\"f\"(\"u\")=0, with Dirichlet data on a cylinder, necessarily inherits a cylindrical symmetry.\n\nIn 1991, Brezis and Nirenberg applied the Ekeland variational principle to extend the mountain pass lemma. In 1993, they made a fundamental contributions to critical point theory in showing (with some contextual assumptions) that a local minimizer of\nin the \"C\" topology is also a local minimizer in the \"W\" topology. In 1995, they used density theorems to extend the notion of topological degree from continuous mappings to the class of VMO mappings.\n\nWith Berestycki and Italo Capuzzo-Dolcetta, Nirenberg studied superlinear equations of Yamabe type, giving various existence and non-existence results. These can be viewed as developments of Brezis and Nirenberg's fundamental paper from 1983.\n\nIn an important result with Berestycki and Srinivasa Varadhan, Nirenberg extended the classically-known results on the first eigenvalue of second-order elliptic operators to settings where the boundary of the domain is not differentiable.\n\nIn 1992, Berestycki and Nirenberg gave a complete study of the existence of traveling-wave solutions of reaction-diffusion equations in which the spatial domain is cylindrical, i.e. of the form ℝ×Ω'.\n\nWith Yanyan Li, and motivated by composite materials in elasticity theory, Nirenberg studied elliptic systems in which the coefficients are Hölder continuous in the interior but possibly discontinuous on the boundary. Their result is that the gradient of the solution is Hölder continuous, with a \"L\" estimate for the gradient which is independent of the distance from the boundary.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This 65 km link across the equator connects Fuvahmulah and Gaafu Dhaalu – and therefore Gaafu Alifu atoll.\n\nThough Dhiraagu is the first Maldivian telecommunications company, it's not the first to start the service. Telecommunication service in the Maldives was officially started on December 23, 1943, by the Maldivian government. On May 17, 1977 Cable & Wireless started its operations as the telecom provider. Later, in 1988, Cable and Wireless and the government of the Maldives formed a joint venture company, Dhiraagu (55% owned by the Government of Maldives and 45% by Cable and Wireless), making it the first ever Maldivian telecommunication company. Later it became a public company and currently the Maldivian government holds 41.8% share of the company, 52% is owned by Batelco and 6.2% is owned by the general public.\n\nOn September 18, 2005 Dhiraagu signed an agreement with Sri Lanka Telecom for an Optical Submarine Cable System. Under the agreement, both companies will invest in maintaining the cable. The actual work of laying the 837 km cable was done by NEC of Japan, under a contract valued at US$22.7 Million. On November 14, 2006 the cable was connected to a landing site at Hulhumale', Maldives. This Tier 2 network has an initial transmission capacity of 3 Giga bit per second (Gbit/s), which is capable of being increased to up to 160 Gbit/s. The system adopts WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing. This is the second submarine cable connecting Maldives to the world.\n\nDhiraagu stated that this cable will help the company to reduce the cost of providing Telephone and Internet services, thus reducing prices. Also the cable system will help to improve quality of services.\n\nDhiraagu has long been seen to Monopolise the telecoms market in the Maldives, a situation it is accused of having created and maintained. Until 2004 the Telecommunications Authority of Maldives had refrained from issuing additional licenses to companies preventing any competition to all of the telecom services provided by Dhiraagu. This status quo may have been deliberately retained by the Maldivian government in an effort to profit from Dhiraagu's revenues, as it partly owns the company.\n\nDhiraagu was also heavily criticized for what the public describes as absurdly high prices during the 1980s and 1990s. Foreseeing competition and regular criticism from the public, the company had dramatically lowered the service prices.\n\nRaajjé Online (ROL), established in 2003, became Dhiraagu's first competitor. ROL is the second Internet Service Provider.\n\nIn 2005, Wataniya Telecom International – a Qatar telecom company (now owned by Ooredoo Group; also merged into the Ooredoo Group) – was awarded the license to operate as the second mobile phone operator. They formed Ooredoo Maldives (formerly Wataniya Telecom Maldives) and started operation on August 1, 2005.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814766", "title": "Beykoz", "text": "Beykoz\n\nBeykoz (), also known as Beicos and Beikos, is a district in Istanbul, Turkey at the northern end of the Bosphorus on the Anatolian side. Beykoz includes everything from the streams of Küçüksu and Göksu (just before Anadolu Hisarı) up to the opening of the Bosphorus into the Black Sea, and the villages in the hinterland as far as the Riva creek. This is one of the most pleasant and peaceful districts of Istanbul, with much greenery still intact. The mayor is Yücel Çelikbilek (AKP).\n\nThe mouth of the Bosphorus has always been a location to spark the imagination, and in ancient times was a place of sacrifice. Blood was spilt to petition Zeus and Poseidon for a safe journey across the treacherous Black Sea, without which no one would venture into those stormy waters.\n\nThe first historic people to settle the upper-Bosphorus were Thracians and Greeks and the ancient name for the area was Amikos (Αμικός in Greek) or Amnicus (Αμνικός), named after a Thracian king. However, the area has changed hands many times since. As well as being one of the most strategically important crossing points in history, the Bosphorus itself has always been rich in fish and opportunities for plundering the even richer communities around the Marmara, and Beykoz has been settled by wave on wave of invaders from around and beyond the Black Sea: Thracians, Bithynians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and finally Turks.\n\nIn the Ottoman period, the land behind Beykoz was open country and forest used for hunting and an escape from the city by the Sultans and their court. The hunting lodge at Küçüksu, and the fountains and mosques that decorate the villages along the coast date from this era. The name Beykoz was established at this time and appears to derives from Bey (meaning prince, lord or gentleman) and Koz (the Persian word for village). (Koz is also a word for a type of walnut, another possible etymology).\n\nUnder Turkish control the straits have retained their strategic value; indeed British troops assembled in Beykoz on their way to fight in the Crimea in 1854.\n\nLater attempts were made to bring industry to the area, most importantly the glassworks at Paşabahçe, which began as small workshops in the 17th century and by the 18th and 19th centuries were a well-established factory making the ornate spiral-designed or semi-opaque white glassware known to collectors worldwide as 'Beykoz-ware'. A well-known shoe factory was later built, now both glass and shoe factories are closed.\n\nOn the hillsides above the Bosphorus Beykoz has always suffered from uncontrolled development and large areas above the Bosphorus are covered in illegal housing, where migrants have come to live and work in the glass and other industries. Areas like Çubuklu and Paşabahçe are continually struggling to put in infrastructure to keep up with the housing being built illegally or semi-legally. Due to this incoming industrial workforce Beykoz has had a working-class character unseen behind the luxury of the Bosphorus waterfront. Schooling is somewhat of a problem and it is common to see children from the Beykoz area going to school by boat to the European side.\n\nNow the illegal building is happening in the forests further back from the sea, particularly in the areas of Çavuşbaşı and Elmalı. This countryside is scattered with little villages, all of which are expanding now more roads are being put through.\n\nNot all the new housing is scrappy, and Beykoz holds some of the most luxurious new development in the Istanbul area, the villa estates of Acarkent and Beykoz Konaklar, home to filmstars, members of parliament and other Istanbul glitterati. How attractive these places are and how cultured and respectable the residents are matters of some debate.\n\nThe Bosphorus has historically been teeming with fish, and Beykoz does have a small fishing community (although the main fishing fleet is based in Istanbul itself). The fish restaurants at Anadolu Kavağı in particular have sprung up to serve day trippers from the Bosphorus tours by ferryboat.\n\nThe Bosphorus coastal road runs up to Beykoz from Beylerbeyi (just below the Bosphorus Bridge) and there are roads down to the coast from the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge too. The district can also be reached by water of course; by ferry from Eminönü, Beşiktaş. There are also smaller boats from Yeniköy to Beykoz, and from Bebek or Emirgan to the neighborhoods of Kanlıca or Anadolu Hisarı.\n\nOf the three most distinctive buildings on the way up the Bosphorus to Beykoz, one is a classic Ottoman imperial hunting lodge Küçüksu Palace; one is much older, the castle of Anadolu Hisarı was constructed by the Ottomans during the buildup to the conquest in order to secure the Bosphorus for the Turkish armies; and one is more recent, the prominent white tower on the hill above Kanlıca is Khedive Palace, built in 1907 as the holiday home of the Khedive of Egypt. Khedive Palace is now a restaurant set in a very attractive park. \nKanlıca and Anadolu Hisarı are pleasant villages with cafes on the waterfront to sit and take tea.\n\nAlong the coast are some of the most expensive houses in the city and many politicians and famous people in Turkey have villas here. Some of the grandest of the huge wooden Ottoman seaside houses called yalı can be found from Anadolu Hisarı up to Beykoz itself. As well as the obvious attraction of living by the water the large areas of forest parkland on hillside along much of this coast make the Beykoz waterfront a peaceful retreat from the city. But the water is the clincher: the scent of the sea coming off the Bosphorus, people fishing, the huge ships sliding by, the sound of foghorns in the evening; no wonder the restaurants and nightclubs on the shore are the classiest in the city, and the coast before Beykoz has its share of these - clubs such as Hayal Kahvesi or Club 29 in Çubuklu, restaurants such as Körfez or Lacivert (both near Anadolu Hisarı). \nMuch of the coast is built on unfortunately, and the buses that drive the coast road are a law unto themselves but there are still plenty of spots on the waterfront to eat, drink, fish or just sit. In places such as Yalıköy there are boats moored up selling grilled mackerel.\n\nIn Beykoz itself there is a large park on the hillside (Beykoz Korusu), and a number of attractive Ottoman fountains. The town centre also has a village feel to it, with smallish, aging buildings, many of them houses rather than blocks of flats, especially on the hills that climb up away from the coast. Being far from the city infrastructure such as natural gas is taking its time to arrive, but the general peacefulness of neighbourhood and the possibility of a Bosphorus view more than compensate. There is however very little in the way of night-life, or even evening-life, or smart places to eat and drink this far up the Bosphorus (although one or two places are opening up now)\n\nBeyond Beykoz, there are large areas of forested countryside, where the people of Istanbul come for picnics at the weekend. And it is then that Beykoz suffers some of the traffic congestion that so plagues the city as a whole.\nSome popular picnic spots include:\nThe upper Bosphorus villages of Anadolu Kavağı, Anadolufeneri and Poyrazköy. In Anadolufeneri, the historical lighttower Anadolu Feneri can be visited. Kavak being particularly popular as the last stop on the Bosphorus ferry cruises, where people stop to eat fish and walk up to the castle on the hill. Fener and Poyraz are smaller but very pleasant fishing villages;\nThe Black Sea village of Riva; where you can swim but you must be careful as this is near the mouth of the Bosphorus and sometimes there are dangerous currents. \n\nThe inland around and between Cumhuriyet Köyü, Ali Bahadır, Değirmendere, Akbaba, Dereseki and Polonezköy are all popular retreats, and new roads are being put through to service the luxury housing that is going up in places.\n\nThere are a number of tombs of Muslim saints and holy places that also attract visitors, particularly the tomb of the Prophet Yuşa on a hill just before Anadolu Kavağı. The tomb is that of Prophet Yusha, the successor to Prophet Musa.\n\nThe neighborhoods of the district of Beykoz are:\n<div>\nAcarlar,\nAkbaba,\nAlibahadır,\nAnadolu Hisarı,\nAnadolu Kavağı,\nAnadolufeneri,\nBaklacı,\nBozhane,\nCumhuriyet,\nÇamlıbahçe,\nÇengeldere,\nÇiftlik,\nÇiğdem,\nÇubuklu,\nDereseki,\nElmalı,\nFatih,\nGöksu,\nGöllü,\nGörele,\nGöztepe,\nGümüşsuyu,\nİncirköy,\nİshaklı,\nKanlıca,\nKavacık,\nKaynarca,\nKılıçlı,\nMahmutşevketpaşa,\nMerkez,\nOrtaçeşme,\nÖrnekköy,\nÖyümce,\nPaşabahçe,\nPaşamandıra,\nPolonezköy,\nPoyraz,\nRiva,\nRüzgarlıbahçe,\nSoğuksu,\nTokatköy,\nYalıköy,\nYavuz Selim,\nYeni Mahalle\nand Zerzavatçı.\n\n"}

He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger, Sr. (6 March 1877-25 August 1959), a police officer, and his wife, Maria (née Peintner) (7 January 1884-16 December 1963), whose family were from South Tyrol. His father served in both the Bavarian State Police (\"Landespolizei\") and the German national Regular Police (Ordnungspolizei) before retiring in 1937 to the town of Traunstein. The \"Sunday Times\" described the older Ratzinger as \"an anti-Nazi whose attempts to rein in Hitler's Brown Shirts forced the family to move several times.\" According to the \"International Herald Tribune\", these relocations were directly related to Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.'s continued resistance to Nazism, which resulted in demotions and transfers. The pope's brother Georg said: \"Our father was a bitter enemy of Nazism because he believed it was in conflict with our faith\". The family encountered the Nazi regime's euthanasia program for the handicapped. John Allen, a Ratzinger biographer, reports a revelation made by Cardinal Ratzinger at a conference in the Vatican on 28 November 1996: \"Ratzinger had a cousin with Down's Syndrome who in 1941 was 14 years old. This cousin was just a few months younger than Ratzinger and was taken away by the Nazi authorities for \"therapy\". Not long afterwards, the family received word that he was dead, presumably one of the 'undesirables' eliminated during that time.\"\n\nHis elder brother, Georg (born 1924) also became a priest. Their sister, Maria (7 December 1921-2 November 1991), managed Joseph's household until her death in 1991, fulfilling a promise she made to their parents to take care of her brothers. She never married. Their great uncle Georg Ratzinger was a priest and member of the Reichstag, as the German Parliament was then called.\nAccording to his cousin Erika Kopper, Ratzinger had no desire from childhood to be anything other than a priest. At the age of 15, she says, he announced that he was going to be a bishop, whereupon she playfully remarked: \"And why not Pope?\". An even earlier incident occurred in 1932, when Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich, visited the small town in which the Ratzinger family lived, arriving in a black limousine. The future pope, then five years old, was part of a group of children who presented the cardinal with flowers, and later that day Ratzinger announced he wanted to be a cardinal, too. \"It wasn't so much the car, since we weren't technically minded\", Georg Ratzinger told a reporter from \"The New York Times\". \"It was the way the cardinal looked, his bearing, and the knickerbockers he was wearing that made such an impression on him.\"\n\nIn 1939, aged 12, he enrolled in a minor seminary in Traunstein. This period lasted until the seminary was closed for military use in 1942, and the students were all sent home. Ratzinger returned to the Gymnasium in Traunstein. During this period in the seminary, following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was legally required as of 25 March 1939. Following the seminary closure he continued required attendance with the Hitler Youth to avoid financial penalties in the Gymnasium tuition fees. The financial penalty (which theoretically required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities) was overlooked when a sympathetic mathematics professor allowed him not to attend any meetings. In Ratzinger's book \"Salt of the Earth\", Ratzinger says the following \"... Thank goodness, there was a very understanding mathematics teacher. He himself was a Nazi but an honest man, who said to me, 'Just go once and get the document so that we have it' ... When he saw that I simply didn't want to, he said, 'I understand, I'll take care of it', and so I was able to stay free of it.\"\n\nAfter Joseph Ratzinger was elected pontiff in 2005, following the death of Pope John Paul II, a neighbor from Traunstein, Elizabeth Lohner, then 84 years old,was quoted in the 17 April 2005 edition of \"The Times\" (\"Papal hopeful is a former Hitler Youth\"), asserting that \"[I]t was possible to resist, and those people set an example for others. The Ratzingers were young and had made a different choice.\" Lohner's brother-in-law was a conscientious objector who spent two years at Dachau for his beliefs.\n\nIn 1943, when he was 16, Joseph Ratzinger was drafted with many of his classmates into the Luftwaffenhelfer program. They were posted first to Ludwigsfeld, north of Munich, as part of a detachment responsible for guarding a BMW aircraft engine plant. Next they were sent to Unterföhring, northwest of Munich, and briefly to Innsbruck. From Innsbruck their unit went to Gilching to protect the jet fighter base and to attack Allied bombers as they massed to begin their runs towards Munich. At Gilching, Ratzinger served in a telephone communications post. On 10 September 1944, his class was released from the Corps. Returning home, Ratzinger had already received a new draft notice for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. He was posted to the Hungarian border area of Austria; Austria having been annexed by Germany in the Anschluss of 1938. When Hungary was occupied by the Red Army Ratzinger was put to work setting up anti-tank defences in preparation for the expected Red Army offensive.\n\nOn 20 November 1944, his unit was released from service. Joseph Ratzinger again returned home. After three weeks passed, he was drafted into the German army at Munich and assigned to the infantry barracks in the center of Traunstein, the city near which his family lived. After basic infantry training, he served at various posts around the city with his unit. They were never sent to the front. In late April or early May, shortly before Germany's surrender, he deserted. Desertions were widespread during the last weeks of the war, although deserters were subject to death if caught. However, diminished morale and equally diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. He left the city of Traunstein and headed for his nearby village. \"I used a little-known back road hoping to get through unmolested. But, as I walked out of a railroad underpass, two soldiers were standing at their posts, and for a moment the situation was extremely exciting for me. Thank God that they, too, had had their fill of war and did not want to become murderers.\" They used the excuse of his arm being in a sling to let him go home.\n\nSoon after, two SS members were given shelter at the Ratzinger family house, and they began to make enquiries about the presence there of a young man of military age. Joseph Ratzinger, Sr. made clear to these SS men his ire against Adolf Hitler, but the two disappeared the next day without taking any action against the Ratzinger family. Cardinal Ratzinger wrote in his memoirs: \"A special angel seemed to be guarding us.\"\n\nWhen the Americans arrived in the village, \"I was identified as a soldier, had to put back on the uniform I had already abandoned, had to raise my hands and join the steadily growing throng of war prisoners whom they were lining up on our meadow. It especially cut my good mother's heart to see her boy and the rest of the defeated army standing there, exposed to an uncertain fate...\" Ratzinger was briefly interned in a POW camp near Ulm and was released on 19 June 1945. He and another young man began to walk the home but got a lift to Traunstein in a milk truck. The family was reunited when his brother, Georg, returned after being released from a POW camp in Italy.\n\nFollowing repatriation in 1945, both Ratzinger brothers entered a Catholic seminary in Freising, and later studied at the \"Herzogliches Georgianum\" of the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. According to an interview with Peter Seewald , Ratzinger and his fellow students were particularly influenced by the works of Gertrud von Le Fort, Ernst Wiechert, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Elisabeth Langgässer, Theodor Steinbüchel, Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers. The young Ratzinger saw the last three in particular as a break with the dominance of neo-Kantianism, with the key work being Steinbüchel's \"Die Wende des Denkens\" (\"The Change in Thinking\"). By the end of his studies, he was drawn more to the active Saint Augustine than to Thomas Aquinas, and among the scholastics he was more interested in Saint Bonaventure. On 29 June 1951, the brothers, along with other seminarians from Traunstein seminary, were ordained in Freising by Cardinal Faulhaber of Munich. His dissertation (1953) was on Augustine, entitled \"The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church\", and his \"Habilitationsschrift\" (a dissertation which serves as qualification for a professorship) was on Bonaventure. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of Freising college in 1958. \n\n\n"}

Usually, pressing Tab will focus on the next element, while pressing Shift + Tab will focus on the previous element. The order of focusing can be determined implicitly (based on physical order) or explicitly (based on tab index). In general, tabbing is cyclical, not linear, meaning that the tabbing will cycle to the first/last element when it moves away from the last/first element.\n\nThe tab order of the graphical control elements on a form determines the sequence in which the focus will change when the user strikes the tab key. Usually the tab order is left to right within each row of controls.\n\nNot all controls can receive the focus. In Java, labels can receive focus but in Visual Studio they cannot. Also, the TabStop property (in Visual Studio) can be set to false to prevent a control from receiving the focus.\n\nOn web pages, by default, tabbing navigates through form fields (such as text entry) and anchors (such as links) in the order they appear in the character stream (i.e., in the raw HTML). This can be overridden by the page author using the tabindex attribute, or by disabling a form field.\n\nAt the client end, OS X defaults to only focusing text boxes and lists, but this setting can be overridden to allow navigation to all entries (see references). Mozilla Firefox can similarly be customized to include or exclude navigation to text areas, other form elements, and anchors.\n\nMost desktop applications and web browsers support this kind of keyboard navigation. But in some web browsers like Opera, an alternative method known as spatial navigation is used. This method, in many cases, can save a lots of key presses. In addition, Mozilla Application Suite and Mozilla Firefox support caret navigation, which provides a more natural way of document navigation similar to mouse navigation.\n\n\n"}

He studied Modern History at University College, Oxford, and graduated with a third class honours in 1913.\n\nHenriques served in the Tank Corps during World War I, taking part in the Battle of Flers where his tank, C22, was ordered to clear the Quadrilateral to the north east of Ginchy. During this operation his tank mistakenly engaged soldiers from The Norfolk Regiment, resulting in several fatalities.\n\nIn addition to writing reforms to religious Jewish ceremonies, Henriques set up boys' clubs for deprived Jewish children. In 1914, Henriques founded the Oxford and St George's Club; this later developed into the Bernhard Baron St George's Jewish Settlement. The boys received education, vocational training, recreation and holidays in the country. From 1923 until 1950, he would frequently send deprived, sick or merely tired children to his country home at Linslade in Buckinghamshire for rest and recuperation.\n\nIn 1923 Henriques became a magistrate, and was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1948 Birthday Honours. He was knighted in 1955. He served as chairman of the East London Juvenile Court for 19 years, and served as a magistrate for 32 years. He retired from the Bench in 1956.\n\nThe former Berner Street in Whitechapel was renamed Henriques Street in his honour.\n\nDuring his time as a magistrate, Henriques criticised the work of the NSPCC on a number occasions. As part of his 1950 book \"The Indiscretions of a Magistrate,\" Henriques argued that legal supervision by a probation officer was more effective than voluntary supervision by an officer of the NSPCC.\n\nIn 1950, during the annual conference of the Magistrates' Association, Henriques spoke in favour of a motion which condemned 'women who go out to work and prefer the privileges of marriage to its responsibilities'. Henriques argued that Women seem to think themselves rivals and equals to men in all things, but they are only superior in some things such as washing the baby and washing up. The proper place for the mother is in her home, and there is no greater cause of juvenile delinquency than when the relationship between mother and child has been cast away.The motion was eventually defeated by 145 votes to 126.\n\nBasil Henriques was the author of several books, mostly concerned with the care of youth, including:\n\nIn his role as a children's court magistrate, he also wrote the foreword to Enid Blyton's novel \"The Six Bad Boys\" (1951), which relates the bad consequences of family breakdown for six boys, culminating in their appearing in a children's court for theft. Henriques, in his foreword, praises Blyton for her treatment of this subject, and stresses the negative effects of broken homes on children – one of the major themes of this novel.\n\nHenriques married Rose Loewe in 1916, and they worked together throughout their marriage.\n\nHenriques died on 2 December 1961, aged 71. In 1966, Lady Rose Henriques published a biography of her husband, entitled \"Years in Stepney.\"\n\n\n"}

Savage was the first New Zealand hip hop artist in history to have a commercial single achieve platinum certification status in the United States. The \"International Breakthrough\" accolade of the Pacific Music Awards was created in his honour. Savage has recently applied his recognisable voice in the electronic dance music space with 5x platinum hit 'Freaks' with Timmy Trumpet, and 4x platinum hit 'Swing' with Joel Fletcher.\n\nSavage joined with friends to form a hip-hop group, the Deceptikonz, in 1997. Success was not instant, however, as the group struggled through several talent shows and small concerts. Their big break came in 1999 when they were signed to South Auckland (Papatoetoe) hip hop label Dawn Raid Entertainment.\n\nIn 2002, the Deceptikonz released \"Elimination\"; a studio album that peaked at number four on the New Zealand albums chart. In late 2003, Savage featured as a member of the Deceptikonz on the Mareko hit single \"Stop, Drop and Roll\"; a number six hit on the New Zealand singles chart.\n\nSavage's first solo single; \"Swing\", was released in January 2005. The hit would eventually crack the Australian singles chart in 2014 and peak at number one for five weeks in the New Zealand singles chart. Three months later, Savage released his debut solo album \"Moonshine\" which reached number two in the New Zealand album chart and included a title track as a follow-up single. This became an even bigger success than the previous single; spending seven weeks at number one on the New Zealand singles chart, and reaching the top ten in the Australian singles chart. The \"Moonshine\" single would eventually become certified twice platinum in New Zealand and gold in Australia. The third single from the album; \"They Don't Know\" reached number three in the New Zealand singles chart and was also a hit for several weeks on the Australian singles chart. In 2007, \"Swing\" featured in a club scene for the United States film \"Knocked Up\" and was also included on the movie soundtrack album.\n\nFollowing the success of appearing in \"Knocked Up\", \"Swing\" was released as a single for the United States in 2008, and remix versions were made with American rappers Soulja Boy Tell 'Em and Pitbull. Upon re-release, \"Swing\" reached number forty-five on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, re-entered the New Zealand singles charts peaking at number twenty-three. By the end of January 2009, the song had sold over 1.5 million units in the United States alone. Because of this; \"Swing\" was certified as a platinum single in the United States.\n\nIn February 2009, Savage released \"Savage Island\", the second studio album of his solo career. The release became his second consecutive top-ten entry on the New Zealand album chart debuting at number nine. The album included \"Moonshine\" from the previous album as well as a remix version of the New Zealand number-one hit \"Not Many\". The release also featured two new singles \"Wild Out (Chooo Hooo)\" and \"Hot Like Fire\". These songs became New Zealand singles chart hits with the former becoming Savage's fourth top-ten peaking song in the national chart. Savage appeared in an issue of Source Magazine to discuss the lyrical meanings behind the tracks of \"Savage Island\" the following month. In October, Savage performed the \"Savage Island\" album track \"I Love The Islands\", to raise funds for the Samoan tsunami relief effort. In December, the video for \"Wild Out (Chooo Hooo)\" was named as one of the five most-watched YouTube music videos in New Zealand.\n\nIn 2010, Savage featured in \"Battle of the Century\", a nationwide tour across New Zealand alongside internationally successful New Zealand rapper Scribe. The same year, the Presents... The Tribal Council album was released. In 2012, Savage featured on the Jade Louise single \"Vibrations\" which was the theme song for the television series \"The GC\".\n\nIn 2013, \"Swing\" was remixed by Australian producer Joel Fletcher. The song peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments exceeding 280,000 copies. In 2014, Savage added vocals to Timmy Trumpet's song \"Freaks\". The song peaked at number one in New Zealand and was certified 2× Platinum by Recorded Music NZ. In Australia, it peaked at number 3 and was certified 5× Platinum by ARIA. It also reached the top five in Finland and won \"Highest Selling Single\" at the 2015 New Zealand Music Awards.\n\nIn 2015, Savage teamed up with Kronic and Far East Movement on \"Push\". The track was featured in the trailer for Fast and the Furious' eighth installment \"The Fate of the Furious\". This trailer was premiered during Super Bowl LI.\n\nIn 2016, Savage released \"Zooby Doo\" with Tigermonkey. The official video was overseen by world-famous choreographer Parris Goebel who runs the Palace Dance Studio in Savage's hometown of Auckland.

The show airs live and features news, topical items, showbiz, style and beauty, home and garden, food, health, real life and other similar features.\n\nThe series was originally presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan for more than a decade after its launch. It is currently presented alternatively by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, and Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes, and has aired on ITV since 3 October 1988, making it one of the longest running daytime programmes on British television. It regularly wins at the National Television Awards and the \"TV Choice\" Awards.\n\nIn 1988, ITV decided to create a live daytime morning programme to replace the weekday morning edition of Children's ITV. Five regional ITV companies made pilot shows to bid for the national contract:\n\nThe first episode of \"This Morning\" aired at 10:40 am on 3 October 1988 and finished at 12:10 pm, live from the Granada studio inside the Albert Dock in Liverpool. An industry insider believed the idea would not work and would be pulled by Christmas 1988, but despite \"This Morning\" being launched with no publicity, its ratings quickly rose to a daily average of two million viewers.\n\nIn the first few series', the show's \"experts\" were weatherman Fred Talbot, agony aunt Denise Robertson, medic Dr Chris Steele, cook Susan Brookes, beauty presenter Liz Earle, hair and make-up artists Andrew and Liz Collinge, and wine expert Charles Metcalfe. The theme tune was by David Pringle, who also wrote opening music for \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Fun House\" and \"The Pyramid Game\".\n\nTo end the first series, in 1989, the show was presented via satellite from Disneyland, California. Produced by Granada's Field Producer, Brian Thomas, the set was built directly in front of 'Sleeping Beauty Castle', a first for Disney. The 'special' week achieved the highest daytime viewing audiences outside of a Royal Wedding.\n\nAs part of the show, weather presenter Fred Talbot used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast. A clip of Mark Roberts, a prolific streaker, running onto Talbot's weather map in 1995 is regularly shown on clip shows.\n\nIn 1996, the show was moved to the London Studios on the grounds that it was difficult to get celebrity guests to travel from London to Liverpool. In the summer of 2001, Madeley and Finnigan left \"This Morning\" to present their own series on Channel 4.\n\nThe show proved newsworthy on several occasions. In 2001 \"This Morning\" covered new ground by showing a gay partnership celebration live, and a 2008 interview with Kerry Katona slurring her words also attracted coverage.\n\nITV relaunched \"This Morning\" in 2009 with a new set and with Holly Willoughby replacing Fern Britton as co-host, which saw ratings rise by 20%.\n\n\"This Morning Cook In!\", an interactive cook event, began on 1 March 2010. Each week, five viewers and a celebrity guest cooked along, via Skype, with Gino D'Acampo or Phil Vickery.\n\nFrom 20 March 2010, \"This Morning\" increased from five to seven shows a week, with two new one-hour shows broadcast on the weekends, where Schofield and Willoughby presented pre-recorded links in between compilations of the week's programming. The weekend editions were later dropped from the schedule.\n\nThe 'Hub' interactive segment was heavily featured from 2010 until 2014. Presenters included Jeff Brazier (2013–14), Jenni Falconer (2013–14), Stephen Mulhern (2011–2014) Rylan Clark (2013–14), Emma Willis (2012–2014), Coleen Nolan (2010–2012), Samanthi Jayawardena (2010–2012) and Matt Johnson (2010–2013).\n\nOn 21 August 2013, Carol Vorderman took her first steps towards a 2014 World Record attempt by doing a solo flight to 1,000 metres high, live on \"This Morning\". Reporter Jenni Falconer covered the occasion.\n\nOn 3 October 2013, \"This Morning\" celebrated its 25th anniversary. The programme was broadcast live from its original home at Albert Dock in Liverpool with presenters Phillip Schofield, Eamonn Holmes, Holly Willoughby and Ruth Langsford being joined by original presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. Numerous historical clips of the show were aired, including Gene Pitney's miming gaffe from 1989. Keith Lemon presented the weather from the show's famous floating weather map, while Stephen Mulhern presented various items including 'The Hub Sub' (the 'Hub' on a submarine). There was speculation concerning whether Fern Britton would return for the 25th anniversary; however, it was confirmed eight days beforehand that she would not.\n\nOn 27 August 2015, \"This Morning\" broadcast the remaining weeks' shows from the South Bank due to the main studio having a revamp ready for the new series on 1 September. The new series had many changes including a brand new set, theme music, titles and the new logo being painted onto the outside of the building.\n\nIn February 2017, it was announced that The London Studios, where \"This Morning\" is filmed, were planned to close for large-scale redevelopment in early 2018, and that \"This Morning\" would be relocated to Television Centre during construction.\n\nIn July 2017, at the start of the summer series, new titles were made to match Langsford and Holmes presenting the show. The titles were different from the usual design, showing a behind-the-scenes look from the doors to the studio, make-up props and room, clothing department and the art gallery with a view of the studio at fast speed with crew in the presenters' place. The show was also retitled \"This Morning with Eamonn and Ruth\". The regular series titles used since 2015 returned on 4 September, when Willoughby and Schofield returned to the show.\n\nFrom 1 to 5 October 2018, \"This Morning\" celebrated 30 years on air. During the week, it broadcast a live wedding, a brief come-back of the classic weather map from Albert Dock (presented by Alison Hammond), special opening titles, a new app, a live studio audience, a special 30 years bus (with correspondents Lisa Snowdon and Ore Oduba), as well as special games and guests. On 2 October, an ITV special aired, entitled \"This Morning: 30 Unforgettable Years\".\n\nFrom 6 January 2020, an extra 30 minutes was added onto the show, which sees the show start at the earlier time of 10:00am as part of a change up of the ITV Daytime schedule.\n\n\"This Morning\" is currently hosted by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, and Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. The main relief presenters consist of Rochelle Humes, Rylan Clark-Neal and Josie Gibson and Alison Hammond. Other stand-in presenters include Amanda Holden, Christine Lampard, Emily Atack, Dr Ranj Singh, Vanessa Feltz, Ben Shephard, Jenni Falconer, Matt Edmondson and Davina McCall.\n\nFrom October 1988 to July 2001, \"This Morning\" was presented by husband and wife Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. However, from 1998 onwards, they hosted only the Monday to Thursday editions, with regular guest presenters hosting on Fridays: during the tenth series Caron Keating and Ross Kelly presided, and from series 11 in 1999 Fern Britton and John Leslie were regular presenters of the Friday show. When Madeley and Finnigan departed the show in 2001, they were replaced by Coleen Nolan and Twiggy, with Fern Britton and John Leslie remaining on Fridays. However, Nolan and Twiggy proved less popular with viewers: Twiggy was later axed, whilst Nolan presented until the end of 2001 with Leslie, and was subsequently replaced by Britton.\n\nAfter John Leslie was caught up in Ulrika Jonsson's rape scandal, his contract was terminated, and he was replaced by Phillip Schofield in 2002. Schofield developed an on-screen relationship with Fern Britton that was characterised by good humour and giggling.\n\nIn 2006, Ruth Langsford, who had been a guest presenter since 1999, and Eamonn Holmes became main presenters.\n\nOn 26 March 2009, Fern Britton announced that she was to leave \"This Morning\", and would be replaced by Holly Willoughby on 14 September 2009. On 17 July 2009, Britton presented her final show after 10 years.\n\nIt has been confirmed, in an episode of Loose Women and This Morning, that Ruth Langsford is the longest-serving presenter of This Morning.\n\nThe show usually scores around 1 million viewers a day, a high rating for the ITV daytime schedules (6am-6pm). On 3 October 2018, the show had one of its highest ratings, when 2.7 million viewers tuned in for its 30th anniversary.\n\nPrior to April 2018, \"This Morning\" broadcast live from Studio 8 at The London Studios on the South Bank, which features large picture windows looking out over the River Thames. Coinciding with the programme's revamp, the outside of the studio was repainted with the new \"This Morning\" logo and branding.\n\nSince 16 April 2018, \"This Morning\" has been broadcast from Studio 3 of the newly renovated Television Centre run by BBC Studioworks, along with the rest of ITV Daytime, including \"Loose Women\", \"Lorraine\" and \"Good Morning Britain\".\n\nIt was planned to move back to the studios in 2023, but in October 2018, ITV announced it was looking to sell the site and would continue with the current studios and offices longer term.\n\n\"This Morning\" has won the National Television Award for Best Daytime/Live Magazine Show for 17 years running, from 1998 to 2020.<ref>\n"}

In other words, there is a morphism from the variety formula_3 to its Albanese variety formula_7, such that any morphism from formula_3 to an abelian variety (taking the given point to the identity) factors uniquely through formula_7. For complex manifolds, defined the Albanese variety in a similar way, as a morphism from formula_3 to a torus formula_7 such that any morphism to a torus factors uniquely through this map. (It is an analytic variety in this case; it need not be algebraic.)\n\nFor compact Kähler manifolds the dimension of the Albanese variety is the Hodge number formula_12, the dimension of the space of differentials of the first kind on formula_3, which for surfaces is called the irregularity of a surface. In terms of differential forms, any holomorphic 1-form on formula_3 is a pullback of translation-invariant 1-form on the Albanese variety, coming from the holomorphic cotangent space of formula_7 at its identity element. Just as for the curve case, by choice of a base point on formula_3 (from which to 'integrate'), an Albanese morphism\n\nis defined, along which the 1-forms pull back. This morphism is unique up to a translation on the Albanese variety. For varieties over fields of positive characteristic, the dimension of the Albanese variety may be less than the Hodge numbers formula_12 and formula_19 (which need not be equal). To see the former note that the Albanese variety is dual to the Picard variety, whose tangent space at the identity is given by formula_20 That formula_21 is a result of Jun-ichi Igusa in the bibliography.\n\nIf the ground field \"k\" is algebraically closed, the Albanese map formula_17 can be shown to factor over a group homomorphism (also called the \"Albanese map\")\n\nfrom the Chow group of 0-dimensional cycles on \"V\" to the group of rational points of formula_7, which is an abelian group since formula_7 is an abelian variety.\n\n\"Roitman's theorem\", introduced by , asserts that, for \"l\" prime to char(\"k\"), the Albanese map induces an isomorphism on the \"l\"-torsion subgroups. Replacing the Chow group by Suslin–Voevodsky algebraic singular homology after the introduction of Motivic cohomology \"Roitman's theorem\" has been obtained and reformulated in the motivic framework.

A part of the Reformed tradition, it is the largest Presbyterian denomination in New Zealand, and known for its relatively progressive stance on doctrine and social issues in comparison with smaller Presbyterian churches in the country. Presbyterianism was introduced to New Zealand by early 19th century settlers, particularly from Scotland and Ireland. It was historically most prevalent in the Otago region. The PCANZ was formed in 1901 with the amalgamation of southern and northern Presbyterian churches. It claims around 29,000 members.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of New Zealand formed in October 1901 with the amalgamation of churches in the Synod of Otago and Southland (which had a largely Free Church heritage) with those north of the Waitaki River.\n\nUnlike other major Christian churches, the Presbyterians did not send missionaries to New Zealand. Presbyterians had by and large come to New Zealand as settlers from Scotland, Ireland and Australia. Dunedin (founded in 1848) and Waipu (founded in 1853) were specifically Presbyterian settlements, but significant numbers of Presbyterians settled in other parts of the country, including Christchurch, Port Nicholson (Wellington), and Auckland. Ministers came with the first European settlers to Wellington, Otago and Waipu, but generally nascent congregations called ministers from Scotland. Missions to the Māori people focused on the Tuhoe people and led to the establishment of the Māori Synod, now known as \"Te Aka Puaho\".\n\nIn 1862 the Presbytery of Auckland had had support from the Presbyterian Church of Ireland and also applied for support from the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland.\n\nIn 1906, 23 percent of New Zealanders (203,600) had identified as Presbyterians. \n\nEthnic diversity grew after World War II with the arrival of Dutch and other European immigrants, and more recently with Pacific Island and Asian migrants. In 1969 the majority of Congregational churches joined the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand. The word \"Aotearoa\" became part of the title of the denomination in 1990, affirming the treaty partnership between the indigenous Māori and the subsequent settlers. PCANZ has 419 congregations.\n\nIn 2003, the Church decided to allow ministers in sexual relationships other than marriage. This was overturned in 2004, and in a meeting of the General Assembly of the Church on 29 September 2006, this was confirmed by 230 votes to 124 (a 65% majority). This prevents people in de facto or gay relationships from becoming ministers in the church. It does not apply to people ordained before 2004. However, some liberal clergy have opposed this policy. In particular, St Andrew's Church on the Terrace in Wellington has announced that it supports same-sex marriage. St Andrew's church has been blessing same-sex civil unions since 2005. In 2014, when same-sex marriage became legal, St Andrew's Church also began performing same-sex marriage ceremonies. Other congregations have also chosen to support same-gender marriage.\n\nIn 2006 the denomination claimed 29,000 members in 430 congregations, and 400 ministers. According to the 2013 census a significantly higher 8.5 percent of the New Zealand population, or 330,516 adherents, claimed some form of affiliation with the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church is governed by a series of courts (councils) at local, regional and national levels. The leader of the church is called a moderator, and is elected by the national court.\n\n\nSeveral groups have broken away from the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand because of its perceived liberal theology. \n\nIn the late 1940s migrants from the Netherlands settling in New Zealand expected to find their spiritual homes in existing churches of Reformed persuasion, particularly the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand. Instead they found it \"less Reformed in doctrine and practice than they had hoped.\" They felt that the Declaratory Act of 1901 (which said that \"diversity of opinion is recognised in this Church on such points in the Confession as do not enter into the substance of the Reformed Faith therein set forth\") had \"opened the doors of the Presbyterian Church to various 'winds of doctrine'.\" As a result, the Reformed Churches of New Zealand were officially established in 1953.\n\nOne group under George Mackenzie left in the 1960s and formed the Orthodox Presbyterian Church of New Zealand.\n\nThe other breakaway church is Grace Presbyterian Church of New Zealand, which was formed of both a group of pre-existing independent churches, and a number of churches that left the PCANZ after the homosexual controversy of 2003. These united into a new Presbyterian denomination for New Zealand. There is sometimes confusion because the church contains a significant number of former members of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand who have sought a more theologically conservative alternative.\n\nThe Presbyterian Social Services Association (PSSA) – subsequently known as \"Support\" – began operating in the early 20th century.\n\n\n"}

It flows in a northeastern direction via Ipatinga, makes a wide curve near Governador Valadares, and flows in a southeastern direction passing through Conselheiro Pena, to enter the Atlantic Ocean near Linhares in Espírito Santo state.

The basin is home to the largest steel making complex in Latin America. Three of the five largest companies in Minas Gerais state in the year 2000, Companhia Siderúrgica Belgo Mineira, Arcelor Mittal (Acesita) and Usiminas, are located there. The largest open-pit mine in the world is operated in the basin by the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. These industrial conglomerates have an important role in Brazilian exports of iron ore, steel, and cellulose (Cenibra). In addition, the Doce basin contributes greatly to production of coffee from Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo as well as fruit pulp from Espírito Santo.\n\nFifteen percent of the GDP of the state of Minas Gerais is produced in the region with the municipality of Ipatinga accounting for 5.4% of that total.

He was a Major in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\n\nBorn to Dr. Waitstill and Lucinda (Wood) Hastings in Mount Vernon, Ohio, he was a descendant of Thomas Hastings who came from East Anglia in England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Hastings was trained as a lawyer. In 1842, he traveled overland to Oregon. While there, he briefly represented Dr. John McLoughlin, preparing his land claim near Willamette Falls and surveying Oregon City, Oregon (which would become the first incorporated city west of the Rocky Mountains). He left in the spring of 1843 for Alta California, a sparsely populated province of Mexico. By the time he returned to the United States in 1844, he had decided to help to wrest California from Mexico and establish an independent Republic of California, with himself holding high office.\n\nHastings wrote \"The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California\" to induce Americans to move to California, hoping they could effect a bloodless revolution by sheer numbers. He described California in glowing terms and gave practical advice to overland travelers. Contrary to popular belief, he did not promote the cutoff that bears his name in his book. He merely described it in a single sentence as a possible route: \"The most direct path would be leave the Oregon route, about two hundred miles east of Fort Hall; thence bearing west-south west, to the Salt Lake; and thence continuing down to the bay of San Francisco.\" (Hastings, pp. 137–138). However, Hastings wrote this statement before he had traveled the route himself, and he may have been unaware of the difficulties in crossing the Wasatch Range and the salt flats of western Utah.\n\nHastings's dream of empire soon collapsed when California was conquered by the United States military during the Mexican–American War. In 1848, Mexico ceded California to the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\n\nA home of his in California, the Hastings Adobe, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAfter serving as a captain in the California Battalion during the Mexican War, Hastings again took up the practice of law. He married Charlotte Toler in 1848 and was a delegate to the 1849 California Constitutional Convention. In the late 1850s he moved his family to Yuma, Arizona, where he served as postmaster and as a territorial judge. During the Civil War, Hastings sided with the South. In 1864, he travelled to Richmond, Virginia, where he met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to gain his support for a plan to separate California from the Union and unite it with the Confederacy. Upon meeting him, President Davis promoted Hastings to the rank of Major in the Confederate States Army, and asked him to assemble a military unit in Arizona, with the aim of defending California. However, the so-called Hastings Plot came to little, as the war ended early the following year.\n\nAfter the end of the war, many disgruntled former Confederates left the United States to establish colonies in Brazil. Hastings visited the region, made arrangements with the Brazilian government, and wrote \"The Emigrant's Guide to Brazil\" (1867) to attract potential colonists. He died at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands in 1870, possibly of yellow fever, while conducting a shipload of settlers to his colony at Santarém.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814859", "title": "Tex Murphy", "text": "Tex Murphy\n\nTex Murphy is a series of adventure games designed by Chris Jones. The eponymous main character is portrayed in live-action by Chris Jones himself. He is characterized as a down-on-his-luck private investigator in a post-nuclear future San Francisco, borrowing tropes from both the film noir and cyberpunk genres.\n\n\"Mean Streets\" is the first game in the \"Tex Murphy\" series. Unlike later games in the series, it features segments in a variety of genres, including adventure game sequences, side-scrolling action sequences, and an open-world flight simulator. It was notable at the time as one of the first commercially available games to use 256-color VGA graphics, as well as for its \"RealSound\" technology that allowed recorded digital audio to be played back without the need for an external sound card.\n\n\"Martian Memorandum\" continues the \"Tex Murphy\" storyline, but features more traditional point-and-click adventure \ngameplay, with inventory-based puzzles and branching dialog trees. It uses digitized actors and features short bits of video during conversation, hinting at the FMV style employed in later games.\n\n\"Under a Killing Moon\" marked a change in direction for the series. Costing over two million dollars and four years of development, it used 3D graphics and full motion video to greatly expand both the gameplay and presentation. Aaron Conners was put in charge of writing duties for the first time, and he re-imagined the Tex character as a down-on-his-luck divorcee, struggling to find work as a private investigator. It featured real-time 3D graphics that were exceptionally detailed at the time, and was one of the first games to take advantage of systems with 16 megabytes of RAM in order to display higher resolution textures.\n\n\"The Pandora Directive\" is the direct sequel to \"Under a Killing Moon.\" It uses the same engine as its predecessor, and features many of the same locations (some newly expanded), particularly on Tex's home street of Chandler Ave. It also features many recurring characters from the previous game, and continues the romantic plot between Tex and Chelsee Bando. It features very similar gameplay to \"Under a Killing Moon\" but introduces logic puzzles alongside the inventory and \"jigsaw\" puzzles of the previous game. It also features a branching storyline, with three main paths and seven unique endings, and allows for multiple solutions to some problems, particularly those involving money.\n\n\"Overseer\" is the fifth game in the series, but its story is largely a re-telling of Tex's first big case, previously portrayed in \"Mean Streets.\" This story is told through the use of a frame narrative, set after the events of \"The Pandora Directive,\" as Tex relates the story of his past to Chelsee. \"Overseer\" maintains the gameplay and presentation style of the previous two games, and borrows little from \"Mean Streets\" beyond its basic plot. It retcons many details from that game further sharpening the divide between the early games in the series and the live-action games. \"Overseer\" was developed to showcase the nascent DVD-ROM format, and was the first game developed to specifically take advantage of DVD. Produced on an accelerated schedule, it was somewhat more limited in scope than \"The Pandora Directive\", without the branching paths and multiple endings. Access hoped that \"Overseer\" would serve to set up a proper sequel to \"Pandora\" and ended the game on a cliffhanger that remained unresolved for over 15 years.\n\n\"Tesla Effect\" is the sixth game in the series, and a true sequel to \"The Pandora Directive\". It continues in the style of the previous titles, making heavy use of live-action FMV, as well as first-person exploration and investigation of 3D environments. It once again returns the series to Chandler Ave and features many of the same characters and locations featured in \"Under a Killing Moon\" and \"The Pandora Directive\". It also features multiple paths and endings like \"Pandora\".\n\n\"The Poisoned Pawn\" will be the seventh game in the series. The game originally began as a fan-made remake of the 5th title in the Tex Murphy series \"Overseer\", and its development was sanctioned by Big Finish Games in early 2015. However, due to increased traction in the game's development, as well as significant technological advancements, the project evolved into an official canon continuation of the Tex Murphy series. The development team was streamlined and partnered with the series' owner (Big Finish Games). Aaron Conners (series writer) has come on board, writing all-new content for the game that will continue directly after the events of \"Tesla Effect\", and taking place in the year 2050. While the foundation of the games' story is still centered around the \"Overseer\" plot, Tex (with the assistance of St. Germaine) will revisit various parts of all of his prior cases \"in order to decipher his true past, and prepare him for an uncertain future.\" The projected release date is late 2019. \"The Poisoned Pawn\" refers to the original title that was given to \"Overseer\", before a name change was decided internally prior to its 1998 release.\n\nThe games in the Tex Murphy series take place in a post-apocalyptic 21st century. All of the games take place mostly in a post-WWIII San Francisco. The skies glow red with radiation, and people who don't live in a better-sheltered city or lack genetic immunity to the radiation are disfigured and usually repulsive. Several San Francisco landmarks are still present, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower and Alcatraz, but most of them are completely abandoned; most damaged beyond repair from bombs in WWIII. The futuristic aspect borrows heavily from sci-fi books and films, most notably \"Blade Runner\" for its flying cars and impossibly dense tenements.\n\nTex Murphy is a hard-boiled PI. Tex is a member of the portion of the population born without any genetic defects making him a normal human (referred by in-game characters as a \"Norm\"). He is an avid fan of the classic film noir films of Humphrey Bogart. As such, he does his work in the style of archetypal film noir detectives such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. He has remarkable skills of observation (always punctuated with humorous internal monologues); when examining objects or features, he hardly ever misses an important or unusual detail. However, he is also occasionally a bit clumsy and naive which gets him into trouble from time to time, as does his sarcastic wit.\n\nTex is honest and generally a good-natured fellow who suffers from a bad back, a little too much alcohol (Bourbon...neat, preferred) and a few too many blows to the head. He runs his private investigation business out of his apartment at the Ritz Hotel on Chandler Avenue in Old San Francisco \"among the mutants and the destitute\" where several businesses and friends reside, including his love interest, the mysteriously mutated newspaper stand owner Chelsee Bando. Aside from wishing for a respectable, not to mention high-paying, client all he'd like to do is earn her love and respect if he can just refrain from placing his admittedly not too bad smelling foot in his mouth.\n\nIn 2011, NowGamer ranked him as the eighth-best game detective, calling him \"the epitome of the hard boiled flatfoot detective\", but wondering why he \"dress[es] like a cross between an alcoholic Indiana Jones and Deckard from \"Blade Runner\".\"\n\nWhen plans for a new game fell through, Chris Jones and Aaron Conners, produced a series of audio dramas in 2001, to continue the storyline. The radio theater stars several of the original characters and voices from the games, including Jones as Tex Murphy. They were financed out-of-pocket by the creators and released for free as digital downloads. These episodes continue to be available through The Unofficial Tex Murphy website. A new series of six more episodes have been announced to accompany the upcoming \"\" as a reward for qualifying backers.\n\nAaron Conners has published novelizations of three of the Tex Murphy games, namely. \"Under a Killing Moon\" (1996), \"The Pandora Directive\" (1995) and \"\" (2014). The novels follow the same story as the games but differ somewhat in detail. Conners has announced two more novels following the success of Tesla Effect. Connors claims that \"One will pick up from the end of The Pandora Directive and reveal the exciting events that happened prior to Tex Murphy and the Tesla Effect. The other will continue the story that comes after, leading up to Tex's last ride into the sunset\".\n\nThe Tex Murphy character was first created for the amateur film \"Plan 10 from Outer Space\", created by Chris Jones and other members of Access Software. Following the development of their flight game \"Echelon\" they wanted to create another 3D flight game that cast players in the role of the futuristic private investigator. Eventually, adventure and action elements emerged, eclipsing the still-present flight sim sequences. \"Mean Streets\" would be noted for its use of high-color VGA graphics, digitized actors, and for its \"Real Sound\" technology, which allowed waveforms to be played back on the PC's speaker without the use of a sound card.\n\nFor the sequel, Access developed a more traditional point and click adventure game, \"Martian Memorandum\". Like \"Mean Streets\" it featured digitized actors, including Chris Jones as Tex, and featured a great deal more digitized voice. \"Martian Memorandum\" also introduced dialog trees to the series, which would continue to be a prominent element.\n\nThe third title in the series spent nearly four years in development, and represented the company's most ambitious game to date. \"Under a Killing Moon\" shipped on a previously unheard-of four CD-ROMs, and featured full voiceover and hours of cut scenes and dialog featuring live actors. Unlike many games using full motion video, however, it also featured high-end real-time 3D graphics and explorable environments unlike anything previously seen in the genre. Under a Killing Moon was widely praised for its use of technology, and represented the series' commercial peak.\n\nFor the next game, Access re-used the engine and technology they had developed for \"Under a Killing Moon,\" but hired Hollywood director Adrian Carr to direct the game's video sequences and improve the storytelling and presentation. It also introduced narrative \"pathing\" wherein moral choices made throughout the game affect the story, and eventually the ending, in a manner similar to later games by BioWare. Although \"The Pandora Directive\" was well received by fans and critics, it was unable to replicate the financial success of its predecessor.\n\nAccess' plans for a sequel eventually evolved into plans for a trilogy, but these plans were scrapped when Intel approached Access about creating a game to demonstrate new DVD technology they were working on. To accommodate the accelerated schedule needed for the project, Access shifted their plans to a re-telling of \"Mean Streets\", done in the style of the later games in the series, and stripped away many gameplay elements. When Intel dropped the project, Access spent 3 months expanding the game's interactive elements and making it into a \"full featured\" title. They shipped the title themselves as \"\". The game was met with mixed reviews, and would mark the end of the series for well over a decade.\n\nShortly after the release of \"Tex Murphy: Overseer\" in 1998, Access Software was sold to Microsoft. By this point in time, the adventure genre was in sharp decline, and Microsoft was more interested in having the studio develop sports titles. Several Tex Murphy games were proposed during this time in a variety of genres, but none ever entered production. Access was later sold to Take-Two Interactive, and then closed down in 2006. In 2007, series leads Chris Jones and Aaron Conners formed a new studio, Big Finish Games, in Salt Lake City, and by 2009 had re-acquired the rights to the series. Conners declared his optimism to the community, stating, \"I no longer think Tex's return is an 'if,' but a 'when.'\"\n\nBig Finish updated the main page of their site in April 2009 with an announcement of \"\"Tex Murphy - Project Fedora\"\" as a future release. This led to much speculation amongst the Tex Murphy fanbase that a new project in the form of a game was in the works as the fedora is a signature component of Tex's outfit, especially in light of the fact that this announcement coincided with the news that the rights to the series had been secured.\n\nOn June 16, 2009, Good Old Games re-released the first three games in the series as downloadable titles and put the last two into the \"coming soon\" section. The fourth game followed on June 30, and the fifth on July 21. Some of the releases use DOSbox to maintain compatibility with modern operating systems. In June 2014, a collection of Tex Murphy games were re-released on Steam as part of a collaboration between Big Finish Games and Night Dive Studios.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, Big Finish Games announced an upcoming Kickstarter campaign for \"\"Tex Murphy - Project Fedora\"\". On May 15, 2012, Big Finish Games launched the Kickstarter campaign for \"\"Tex Murphy - Project Fedora\"\" with a goal of $450,000, to be supplemented by an additional $300,000 from Big Finish. This goal was met on June 7, and the campaign eventually raised $657,196, including PayPal donations. Production began on June 18, 2012. The game's official name was revealed on July 10, 2013 as \"\".\n\nOn May 10, 2016, Big Finish Games announced their official partnership with the development collective \"Chaotic Fusion\", for the development of the seventh game in the series \"The Poisoned Pawn\". The game is currently in production and is slated for release in late 2018.\n\nOn Dec 2, 2017, Big Finish Games released a documentary on the Tex Murphy franchise. The video was originally a \"Kickstarter\" backer incentive for \"\", but was made available to the general public via YouTube. The 45-minute video provides a detailed insight into the history and development of the Tex Murphy character and game series. It also features interviews with many of the series' original creators, including behind the scenes video content from when the \"Access Software\" company was formed, all the way through to the \"Tesla Effect\" Kickstarter campaign.\n\nOn Feb 3, 2016, Guinness World Records awarded \"Longest-running graphic adventure protagonist\" to George Stobbart (from the \"Broken Sword\" series). The award was in recognition of his character spanning a period between September 30, 1996 and December 5, 2013 (a total of 17 years and 199 days). Then on March 3, 2016, the award was handed to Guybrush Threepwood (from the \"Monkey Island\" series), after his character was recognized for spanning the period between October 15, 1990 and December 8, 2009 (a total of 19 years and 54 days as of March 3, 2016).\n\nHowever, when taking into consideration Tex Murphy's first adventure (\"Mean Streets\"' released in 1989), and his latest adventure (\"Tesla Effect\", released on May 8, 2014), the Tex Murphy character has actually spanned a total of (at least) 24 years and 121 days.\n\nDespite Tex Murphy being a longer running graphic adventure protagonist (when taking into consideration the length of time between his first and his latest appearance), Guinness' justification for not considering Tex Murphy for this award was due to its interpretation of \"Tesla Effect\" as a reboot or \"revival\", despite the game officially being a canon continuation of the series and the Tex Murphy character as an ongoing protagonist. Guinness also cited Tex's 16-year hiatus as evidence of this. This caused some controversy within the adventure gaming community, with some adventure fans and adventure forums questioning and criticizing Guinness' decision when it was first awarded.\n\nThe award currently still stands with Guybrush Threepwood.\n\nDespite officially acknowledging Tex's 16-year absence as the primary reason for disqualifying it from the \"\"Longest-running graphic adventure protagonist\"\" record, Guinness World Records currently maintains that the \"\"Longest wait for a sequel to a point n click adventure\"\" record still stands with 'Tales of Monkey Island' for the 8 years and 242 days between \"Escape from Monkey Island\" in 2000 and \"Tales of Monkey Island\" in 2009.—Which is half as long as the wait between \"Tex Murphy: Overseer\" (released in 1998), and \"Tesla Effect\" (released in 2014) - 16 years. A direct contradiction to the justification had been used to disqualify it from the \"Longest-running graphic adventure protagonist\" record.\n"}

When Charles died in 1985, the station was more than $750,000 in debt. Henderson and her daughters rebuilt the business, an effort which won her Businesswoman of the Year in 1991. She then published her autobiography \"From Strength to Strength\" in 1993 which focused on rebuilding the property after her husband's death.\n\nAfter deciding to sell the station and retire to Queensland, Henderson and her eldest daughter Marlee Ranacher had a well-publicised falling out. After legal proceedings, Marlee and her husband Franz purchased Bullo River Station in 2001.

{"id": "1814865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814865", "title": "Rapparee", "text": "Rapparee\n\nRapparees or raparees (from the Irish \"ropairí\", plural of \"ropaire\", meaning half-pike or pike-wielding person) were Irish guerrilla fighters who operated on the Jacobite side during the 1690s Williamite war in Ireland. Subsequently, the name was also given to bandits and highwaymen in Ireland – many former guerrillas having turned to crime after the war ended. They share similarities with the hajduks of Eastern Europe.\n\nThere was a long tradition of guerrilla warfare in Ireland before the 1690s. Irish irregulars in the 16th century were known as \"ceithearnaigh choille\", \"wood-kerne\", a reference to native Irish foot-soldiers called \"ceithearnaigh\", or \"kerne\".\n\nIn the Irish Confederate Wars of the 1640s and 50s, irregular fighters on the Irish Confederate side were known as \"tories\", from the Irish word \"tóraidhe\" (modern \"tóraí\") meaning \"pursuer\".\n\nFrom 1650 to 1653, during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the tories caused the occupying English Parliamentarian forces a great deal of trouble, attacking vulnerable garrisons, tax-collectors and supply columns and then melting away when faced with detachments of English troops. Henry Ireton first led a sweep of County Wicklow and the south midlands in September–October 1650 to try to clear it of tory guerrillas.\n\nThe Parliamentarian commander John Hewson during the 1650–51 winter, led punitive columns into the midlands and the Wicklow mountains to try and root out the tory bands. Although they captured a number of small castles and killed several hundred guerrillas, they were not able to stop the tories' attacks. In Wicklow especially, he destroyed all the food he found in order to starve the guerrillas into submission.\n\nThe guerrillas were eventually defeated by evicting all civilians from areas where they operated and killing those civilians then found within those zones. As of April 1651, the Parliamentarians designated areas such as Wicklow and much of the south of the country as what would now be called free-fire zones, where anyone found would be \"taken slain and destroyed as enemies and their cattle and good shall be taken or spoiled as the goods of enemies\". Hewson ordered the expulsion of Roman Catholic townsmen from Dublin, for fear they were aiding the tories in the countryside. Other counter-guerrilla tactics included selling those captured as indentured labour and finally publishing surrender terms allowing tories to leave the country to enter military service in France and Spain. The last organised bands of tories surrendered in 1653, when many of them left the country to serve in foreign armies.\n\nAfter the war, many tories continued their activities, \"a spasmodic and disconnected opposition to the new regime\", in part as Catholic partisans, in part as ordinary criminals who \"brought misery to friend and foe alike\". The ranks of tories remained filled throughout the post-war period by displaced Irish Catholics whose land and property was confiscated in the Cromwellian Settlement.\n\nIn the 1690s, during the Glorious Revolution, the label \"tory\" was insultingly given to the English supporters of James II, to associate them with the Irish rebels and bandits of a generation earlier. In Ireland, Irish Catholics supported James – becoming known as Jacobites. Under Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, each locality had to raise a regiment to support the Jacobite cause. Most did so, but James and his French backers did not have the resources to arm and pay them all, so many of them were disbanded. It was from these bands that most of the Rapparees were organised. They armed themselves with whatever they could find or take from Protestant civilians, including muskets, long knives (\"sceana\" or \"skiens\") and half-pikes. The rapparees got their name from this last weapon – a pike about 6 feet (2 m) long, cut down from the standard military pike which was up to 16 feet (5 m) long – known in Irish as a \"rapaire\". \n\nThroughout the campaign, the rapparees caused major logistical problems to the Williamite army, raiding their rear areas and killing their soldiers and supporters. Many rapparee bands developed a bad reputation among the general civilian population, including among Catholics, for robbing indiscriminately. George Warter Story, a chaplain with a Williamite regiment, relates that the rapparees hid their weapons in bogs when Williamite troops were in the area and melted into the civilian population, only to re-arm and reappear when the troops were gone. The rapparees were a considerable help to the Jacobite war effort, tying down thousands of Williamite troops who had to protect supply depots and columns. The famous rapparee \"Galloping Hogan\" is said to have guided Patrick Sarsfield's cavalry raid that destroyed the Williamite siege train at the siege of Limerick in 1690.\n\nRapparees have been depicted in fiction, for example in Thomas Flanagan's \"Year of the French\", \"Joshua's son Jonathan, who in 1690 had raised his company to serve King William at the Boyne and Aughrim and Limerick, rode home to Mount Pleasant and defended it for five years against the sporadic sallies of the rapparees, the swordsmen, masterless now, of the defeated James Stuart.\" \n\nThere is an old folk song devoted to the subject of the Rapparee:\n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n"}

Several Dutch companies provided the United States, Israel and Pakistan with components for these weapons. \n\nThe Netherlands ratified the Geneva Protocol on 31 October 1930. It also ratified the Biological Weapons Convention on 10 April 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention on 30 June 1995.\n\nThe Netherlands ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on 2 May 1975.\n\nIn the past (1960s till 1990s), the Netherlands took part in the deployment of NATO nuclear artillery shells for its self-propelled howitzers and missile artillery units. These 8 inch shells and warheads for Honest John, and later Lance, missiles were stored at the special ammunition stores at 't Harde and Havelterberg. These weapons are no longer operational.\n\nUntil 2006, Royal Netherlands Navy P-3 Orion aircraft, and their predecessors the P-2 Neptunes, based at former Naval Air Station Valkenburg in Katwijk and Curaçao in the Caribbean were assigned U.S. Navy Nuclear Depth Bombs (NDB) for use in anti-submarine warfare. These weapons were originally the Mk 101 Lulu, which yielded 11 kt; later, they were replaced by the Mk-57 (also referred to as the B-57).\n\nThe NDBs were stored under U.S. Marine guard at RAF St. Mawgan, Cornwall, UK, which also held 60 similar weapons for the use of RAF Shackleton and Nimrod aircraft. The storage arrangements were agreed in 1965 between the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and President Johnson in a secret memorandum now declassified in the UK archives.\n\nAt present (2008), the USAF still provides 22 tactical B61 nuclear bombs for use by the Netherlands under the NATO nuclear weapons sharing agreement. These weapons are stored at Volkel Air Base and, in time of war, they may be delivered by Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 warplanes. (The Dutch government has never formally admitted or denied the presence of these weapons, but former prime ministers Dries van Agt and Ruud Lubbers both acknowledged their presence in 2013.)\n\nMany countries believe that this violates Articles I and II of the NPT, where the Netherlands has committed:\n\nThe U.S. insists that its forces control the weapons and that no transfer of the nuclear bombs or control over them is intended \"unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the [NPT] treaty would no longer be controlling\", so there is no breach of the NPT.\n\nAlongside companies from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States, Belgium, Spain, India, and Brazil, Dutch companies provided Iraq with the chemicals used as precursors to produce chemical weapons for use against Iran in the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nSuffering from chemical warfare during the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), 2000 Iranians submitted an indictment some years ago with a Tehran court against nine companies that had provided Saddam Hussein with such chemicals, and 455 American and European companies, two thirds being German, provided aid to Iraq during its war with Iran. The United Nations published a 12,000-page report about the conflict and named the companies involved.\n\nOn 20 February 2008, it was revealed that the Netherlands had conducted chemical warfare experiments with nerve gas in the early 1950s. These experiments were conducted by the TNO organization on the request of the Defense Department. They consisted of the use of sarin, tabun, soman, and a modified French gas called \"Stof X\" (Substance X), which was more poisonous than sarin. The experiments were carried out on animals in the village of Harskamp and on the Vliehors bombing range, located on the island of Vlieland. After 1956, the only experiments were those conducted jointly with France and Belgium in the desert of Algeria, which utilized 6 kilograms of \"Stof X\". The reason behind these experiments was the fear of an attack by the Soviet Union.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814876", "title": "BrahMos", "text": "BrahMos\n\nThe BrahMos (designated PJ-10) is a medium-range ramjet supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarine, ships, aircraft, or land. It is a joint venture between the Russian Federation's NPO Mashinostroyeniya and India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), who together have formed BrahMos Aerospace. It is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks cruise missile and other similar sea-skimming Russian cruise missile technology. The name BrahMos is a portmanteau formed from the names of two rivers, the Brahmaputra of India and the Moskva of Russia.\n\nIt is the world's fastest anti-ship cruise missile in operation. The land-launched and ship-launched versions are already in service. An air-launched variant of BrahMos appeared in 2012 and entered service in 2019. A hypersonic version of the missile, BrahMos-II, is also presently under development with a speed of Mach 7-8 to boost aerial fast strike capability. It is expected to be ready for testing by 2020.\n\nIndia wanted the BrahMos to be based on a mid range cruise missile like the P-700 Granit. Its propulsion is based on the Russian missile, and missile guidance has been developed by BrahMos Aerospace. The missile is expected to reach a total order of US$13 billion.\n\nIn 2016, as India became a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), India and Russia are now planning to jointly develop a new generation of Brahmos missiles with 600 km-plus range and an ability to hit protected targets with pinpoint accuracy. In 2019, India upgraded the missile with a new range of 500 km.\n\nThe BrahMos has been developed as a joint venture between the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India and the Federal State Unitary Enterprise NPO Mashinostroyenia (NPOM) of Russia as BrahMos Aerospace via an inter-government agreement. The company was established on 12 February 1998 with an authorized share capital of . India holds 50.5% share of the joint venture and its initial financial contribution was , while Russia holds 49.5% share with an initial contribution of .\n\nSince late 2004, the missile has undergone several tests from a variety of platforms, including a land based test from the Pokhran range in the desert, in which the evasive 'S' maneuver at Mach 2.8 was demonstrated for the Indian Army and a launch in which the land attack capability from sea was demonstrated.\n\nKeltec (now known as BrahMos Aerospace Trivandrum Ltd or BATL), an Indian state-owned firm, was acquired by BrahMos Corporation in 2008. Approximately will be invested in the facility to make BrahMos components and integrate the missile systems. This was necessitated by the increased order book of the missile system, with orders having been placed by both the Indian Army and Navy. Initially, Russia supplied 65% of the BrahMos' components, including its ramjet engine and radar seeker. Currently 65% of the missile is manufactured in India and there are plans to increase this to 85% by replacing the components with an Indian made seeker and booster.\n\nBrahMos was first test-fired on 12 June 2001 from the Integrated Test Range (ITR), Chandipur in a vertical launch configuration. On 14 June 2004, another test was conducted at ITR and BrahMos was fired from a mobile launcher. On 5 March 2008, the land attack version of the missile was fired from the destroyer and the missile hit and destroyed the right target among a group of targets. The vertical launch of BrahMos was conducted on 18 December 2008 from INS Ranvir. The BrahMos I Block-I for the army was successfully tested with new capabilities in the deserts of Rajasthan, at a test range near Pokharan in December 2004 and March 2007.\nDuring a user trial on 20 January 2009, BrahMos was tested with a new navigation system but it failed to hit the target. BrahMos Aerospace Corporation's director Dr Sivathanu Pillai said, \"The missile performance was absolutely normal until the last phase, but the missile missed the target, though it maintained the direction.\" and that \"The problem was in the software, not hardware\". The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said that there were \"small hitches\" in the last stage of the test firing due to delay in input of satellite navigation input to the Inertial Navigation System, the missile traveled for 112 seconds instead of the slated 84 seconds and fell 7 km away from the target. According to BrahMos Corporation, another test of the new missile was to be conducted within one month, but it was eventually conducted on 4 March 2009 and was deemed successful. BrahMos was test-fired again on 29 March 2009. For the test, the missile had to identify a building among a cluster of buildings in an urban environment. BrahMos successfully hit the intended target in two and a half minutes of launch. According to official sources, \"The new seeker is unique and would help us to hit our targets, which are insignificant in terms of size, in a cluster of large buildings. India is now the only nation in the world with this advanced technology\" After the third test, Lt Gen Noble Thamburaj, said that the Indian Army wanted the BrahMos to achieve high standards of accuracy and congratulated the scientists on behalf of the Indian Army. The Indian Army confirmed that the test was successful and the army is satisfied with the missile. This marking the completion of the development phase of BrahMos Block-II, and it was ready for induction.\n\nThe 5 September 2010 test of BrahMos created a world record for being the first cruise missile to be tested at supersonic speeds in a steep-dive mode. The missile was test-fired from the integrated test range launching complex-3 (LC-3) at Chandipur around 11.35 am. With this launch, the Indian army's requirement for land attacks with Block-II advanced seeker software with target discriminating capabilities was met. BrahMos became the only supersonic cruise missile possessing advanced capability of selection of a particular land target amongst a group of targets, providing an edge to the user with precise hit.\n\nBlock III has advanced guidance and upgraded software, incorporating high manoeuvres at multiple points and steep dive from high altitude. The steep dive capability of the Block III enables it to hit targets hidden behind a mountain range. It will be deployed in Arunachal Pradesh. It can engage ground targets from an altitude as low as 10 meters for surgical strikes without any collateral damage. It is capable of being launched from multiple platforms like submarines, ships, aircraft and land based Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL). On 12 August 2011, it was test-fired by ground forces and met all mission parameters.\n\nThe new navigation system uses an Indian chip called G3OM (GPS, GLONASS, GAGAN on a Module). The system weighs around 17 grams, and gives accuracy below five meters using Indian, US and Russian navigation satellites. The system can be used in tandem with and Inertial Navigation System (INS) to provide high-accuracy targeting without using any seeker.\n\nBrahMos was tested with an Indian seeker for the first time on 22 March 2018, and was tested with an India-developed propulsion system, airframe and power supply on 30 September 2019.\n\nThe submarine-launched variant of Brahmos was test fired successfully for the first time from a submerged pontoon near Visakhapatnam at the coast of Bay of Bengal on 20 March 2013. This was the first vertical launch of a supersonic missile from a submerged platform. The missile can be launched from a depth of . In late January 2016, Russia confirmed that future Indian-made submarines would be armed with smaller version of the missile that could fit inside a torpedo tube.\n\nThe BrahMos-A is a modified air-launched variant of the missile with a range of 400 km which can be launched from a Sukhoi Su-30MKI as a standoff weapon. To reduce the missile's weight to 2.55 tons, many modifications were made like using a smaller booster, adding fins for airborne stability after launch, and relocating the connector. It can be released from the height of 500 to 14,000 meters (1,640 to 46,000 ft). After release, the missile free falls for 100–150 meters, then goes into a cruise phase at 14,000 meters and finally the terminal phase at 15 meters. BrahMos Aerospace planned to deliver the missile to the IAF in 2015, where it is expected to arm at least three squadrons. A Su-30MKI is able to only carry one BrahMos missile.\nThe missile was also planned to arm the Indian Navy's Ilyushin Il-38 and Tupolev Tu-142 maritime patrol and anti-submarine aircraft with 6 missiles per aircraft, but this could not be made possible due to insufficient ground clearance of the IL-38, high cost of modifying the Tu-142 and the questionable benefits of modifying an ageing fleet.\n\nThe air-launched version for the Indian Air Force was ready for testing in 2008. An expert committee from the DRDO and the Indian Air Force (IAF) had ruled out any structural modifications to the Su-30MKI to carry the missile. On 22 October 2008, A. Sivathanu Pillai, Chief Controller, R&D, DRDO and CEO and managing director of BrahMos Aerospace, announced that trials and tests were to be carried out by 2011, and the IAF would get its own version of BrahMos by 2012.\n\nOn 10 January 2009, it was reported that two Indian Air Force Su-30MKI fighter jets were sent to Russia for a retrofit program that would enable them to launch the missile. On 8 August 2009, Alexander Leonov, Director of the Russian Machine Building Research and Production Center, said \"we are ready for test launches.\" He also said that a new takeoff engine for the launching of the missile in air and at extremely high altitudes had been developed, and the initial test firing of the missile would be undertaken from the Su-30 MKI but did not specify the dates. On 26 February 2012, A. Sivathanu Pillai said that the air-launched version of BrahMos is being developed and will be tested by the end of 2012. This version of the BrahMos missile will use air-breathing scramjet propulsion technology and would be more fuel-efficient than a traditional rocket-powered missile.\n\nThe purchase of over 200 air-launched BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles for the IAF was cleared by Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on 19 October 2012, at the cost of . This would include funds for the integration and testing of the BrahMos on Su-30MKI of the IAF. As per this plan, the first test of the air-launched version of the missile was to be conducted by December 2012. Two Su-30MKI of the IAF would be modified by the HAL at its Nashik facility where they will also be integrated with the missile's aerial launcher.\n\nA demonstration flight was carried out at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Nashik on 25 June 2016 as a modified Su-30MKI carrying BrahMos-A underwent a successful trial flight, the first time a heavyweight supersonic cruise missile had been integrated on a long-range fighter aircraft; the project to adapt the weapon for air launch was approved in 2011, but was bogged down with technology transfer and intellectual property rights concerns. To carry the missile, the Su-30MKI undercarriage had to be strengthened, which also required new hard points and structural modifications. The cost of adapting the BrahMos for air launch was \"phenomenal,\" but efforts to downsize the missile were abandoned after an attempt to reduce the size of the ramjet. On 22 November 2017, the missile was successfully test fired for the first time from a Sukhoi-30MKI against a sea-based target in the Bay of Bengal. This made Indian Air Force the first in the world to have successfully tested such a type of air launched trisonic-class missile on a sea-based target. After the IAF successfully tested Brahmos from a Su-30MKI against a sea-based target, it declared on 17 December 2019 that the integration of BrahMos-A on Su-30 MKI is complete.\n\n40 IAF SU-30MKI are to undergo modifications to be equipped to carry the missile. According to the CEO of BrahMos Aerospace, Sudhir Kumar Mishra, Brahmos-A when fired from Su-30 aircraft can reach targets thousands of kilometres away. On 20 January 2020, the IAF commissioned its first squadron of Su-30MKI fighters equipped with the PJ-10 BrahMos-A missile.\n\nIn 2016, India became a member of the MTCR. India and Russia are now planning to jointly develop a new generation of Brahmos missiles with 600 km-plus range and an ability to hit protected targets with pinpoint accuracy. The upgrade will also be applied to all existing BrahMos missiles.\n\nBrahMos-II is a hypersonic cruise missile currently under development and is estimated to have a range of 290 km. Like the BrahMos, the range of BrahMos II has also been limited to 290 km to comply with the MTCR. With a speed of Mach 7, it will have double the speed of the current BrahMos missile, and it will be the fastest hypersonic missile in the world. Development could take 7–8 years to complete However, the Brahmos-NG seems to have replaced the hypersonic Brahmos-II as the focus of the joint venture.\n\nBrahMos-NG (Next Generation) is a mini version based on the existing BrahMos, will have same 290 km range and mach 3.5 speed but it will weigh around 1.5 tons, 5 meters in length and 50 cm in diameter, making BrahMos-NG 50 percent lighter and three meters shorter than its predecessor. The system is expected to be inducted in the year 2024. BrahMos-NG will have lesser RCS (radar cross section) compared to its predecessor, making it harder for air defense systems to locate and engage the target. BrahMos-NG will have Land, Air, ship-borne and Submarine tube-launched variants. First test flight is expected to take place in 2022–24. Initially Brahmos-NG was called as Brahmos-M. Additionally, the BrahMos-NG will have an AESA radar rather than the mechanically scanned one on the PJ-10.\n\nThe missile will arm the Sukhoi Su-30MKI, Mikoyan MiG-29K, HAL Tejas and future inductions such as the Dassault Rafale, Sukhoi Su-57, HAL FGFA, HAL MWF and possibly the Mikoyan MiG-35. Submarine launched variant will be capable of being fired from the new P75I class of submarines. A model of the new variant was showcased on 20 February 2013, at the 15th anniversary celebrations of BrahMos Corporations. The Sukhoi SU-30MKI would carry three missiles while other combat aircraft would carry one each.\n\nMissile is likely to be ready in late 2022.\n\nThe former President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam asked BrahMos Aerospace to develop an advanced version of the BrahMos cruise missile to maintain India's lead in the field. He stated that a hypersonic version of BrahMos would be needed that could deliver its payload and return to base.\n\nBrahMos claims it has the capability of attacking surface targets by flying as low as five meters in altitude and the maximum altitude it can fly is 14000 meters. It has a diameter of 70 cm and a wingspan of 1.7 m. It can gain a speed of Mach 2.8, and has a maximum range of 450 km. The ship-launched and land-based missiles can carry a 200 kg warhead, whereas the aircraft-launched variant (BrahMos A) can carry a 300 kg warhead. It has a two-stage propulsion system, with a solid-propellant rocket for initial acceleration and a liquid-fuelled ramjet responsible for sustained supersonic cruise. Air-breathing ramjet propulsion is much more fuel-efficient than rocket propulsion, giving the BrahMos a longer range than a pure rocket-powered missile would achieve.\n\nThe high speed of the BrahMos likely gives it better target-penetration characteristics than lighter subsonic cruise-missiles, such as the Tomahawk. Being twice as heavy and almost four times as fast as the Tomahawk, the BrahMos has more than 32 times the on-cruise kinetic energy of a Tomahawk missile, although it carries only 3/5 the payload and a fraction of the range, which suggests that the missile was designed with a different tactical role. Its 2.8 mach speed means that it cannot be intercepted by some existing missile defence systems and its precision makes it lethal to water targets.\n\nAlthough BrahMos was primarily an anti-ship missile, the BrahMos Block III can also engage land-based targets. It can be launched either in a vertical or inclined position and is capable of covering targets over a 360-degree horizon. The BrahMos missile has an identical configuration for land, sea, and sub-sea platforms. The air-launched version has a smaller booster and additional tail fins for added stability during launch. The BrahMos has currently been configured for aerial deployment with the Su-30MKI as its carrier. On 5 September 2010 BrahMos created a record for the first supersonic steep dive.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia and Russia intend to make 2,000 BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles over the next ten years through their joint venture company, and nearly 50% of them are expected to be exported to friendly countries. The Brahmos headquarters complex is located at New Delhi and consists of a design center and aerospace knowledge center. The integration complex is located at Hyderabad and a production center is located at Thiruvananthapuram. Another assembly line is being established at Pilani.\n\nBy April 2013, Brahmos has been inducted in eight warships of the Indian Navy. The following ship classes of the navy are equipped with BrahMos:\n\n\nThe Brahmos Block I was inducted into the army on 21 June 2007. The Brahmos has been inducted in three regiments of the Indian Army. The army has raised one regiment (numbered 861) of the Mark I and two missile regiments of the BrahMos Mark II, numbered 862 and 863. The first regiment with five mobile launcher cost $83 million to set up. Each of the two new regiments would have between four and six batteries of three to four Mobile Autonomous Launchers (72 missiles per regiment) that can be connected to a mobile command post. All these regiments will be part of the army's existing 40th and 41st Artillery Divisions. The operational BrahMos regiments are:\n\n\nAccording to unspecified sources the BrahMos could be fitted to the updated Gorshkov class of frigates which will be entering the Russian Navy soon. The defence ministry reported that due to the size and hull specifications of the BrahMos, few if any of its new ships will be able to accommodate it.\n\nIn September 2016, it was revealed that the Russian Defense Ministry is interested in purchasing the air-launched BrahMos to arm their Su-30SM fighters. Talks could begin in 2017.\n\nSeveral countries, including the Philippines, Vietnam, South Africa, Egypt, Oman, Chile and Brunei have expressed interest in the missile. In February 2010, a senior executive said that BrahMos was in negotiations with Chile, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia regarding the purchase of the missile. Malaysia is also reported to be considering the purchase of the missile for use on its Kedah class warships and fighter jets. Informal negotiations are ongoing between India and Vietnam for the sale of BrahMos missiles. BrahMos Aerospace has said that several Southeast Asian and Latin American countries have expressed interest in the system, with particular interest in naval and coastal defense versions, and that a \"definite list of countries\" exists. Industry sources say that interested countries include Vietnam, Indonesia, and Venezuela. The intergovernmental agreement between India and Russia to develop the BrahMos stipulates that both countries would have to approve an export sale. On 20 April 2016, BrahMos Aerospace spokesman Praveen Pathak said that the first export contract on delivering BrahMos to a country in the Asian-Pacific Region will be signed by the end of 2016. The Asian-Pacific nation would be a friendly nation that neither Russia nor India has any conflicts with.\n\nOne of the major issues regarding sales of the missile is that the nations looking to buy may have stressful relations with allies and trading partners of Russia. China is one of the main nations that has objections about its neighbours getting these missiles for their navies. In recent years, the export of BrahMos to Vietnam has picked up pace with plans and negotiations reaching a possible conclusion in mid-2016. The only objection could be from China, which sees the selling of these missiles to Vietnam as an act of belligerence and interference in the South China Sea dispute.\n\nOn 8 October 2019, the Philippines was announced to be the first export customer of the BrahMos missile system. In an interview conducted by the Philippine News Agency, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that two BrahMos batteries will be acquired. He added that the contract will be signed \"during the first or second quarter of 2020\" and that the acquisition will be done through a \"government-to-government deal.\" \n\n\n\n"}

The maximum size of a microATX motherboard is . The standard ATX size is 25% longer, at .\n\nCurrently available microATX motherboards support CPUs from VIA, Intel or AMD.\n\nmicroATX was explicitly designed to be backward-compatible with ATX. The mounting points of microATX motherboards are a subset of those used on full-size ATX boards, and the I/O panel is identical. Thus, microATX motherboards can be used in full-size ATX cases. Furthermore, most microATX motherboards generally use the same power connectors as ATX motherboards, thus permitting the use of full-size ATX power supplies with microATX boards.\n\nmicroATX boards often use the same chipsets (northbridges and southbridges) as full-size ATX boards, allowing them to use many of the same components. However, since microATX cases are typically much smaller than ATX cases, they usually have fewer expansion slots.\n\nMost modern ATX motherboards have a maximum of seven PCI or PCI-Express expansion slots, while microATX boards only have a maximum of four (four being the maximum permitted by the specification). In order to conserve expansion slots and case space, many manufacturers produce microATX motherboard with a full range of integrated peripherals (especially integrated graphics), which may serve as the basis for small form factor and media center PCs. For example, the ASRock G31M-S motherboard (pictured right) features onboard Intel GMA graphics, HD Audio audio, and Realtek Ethernet (among others), thus freeing up the expansion slots that would have been used for a graphics card, sound card, and Ethernet card. In recent years, however, it is common even for ATX boards to integrate all these components, as much of this functionality is contained in the typical northbridge/southbridge pair. With the \"must-have\" functions already present on the motherboard, the need for having many expansion slots has faded, and adoption of microATX has increased even to be used in ATX cases.\n\nIn the DIY PC market, microATX motherboards in general are favored by cost-conscious buyers, where cost savings for the equivalent feature sets outweigh the added expandability of extra PCI/PCI Express slots provided by the full ATX versions. Since 2006, dual-GPU configurations became possible on microATX motherboards for high-end enthusiast gaming setups, further reducing the need for full ATX motherboards.\n\nIn addition, some microATX cases require the use of low-profile PCI cards and use power supplies with non-standard dimensions.\n\nCompared to Mini-ITX, microATX motherboards have a maximum of four expansion slots and four DIMM slots, as opposed to the single expansion slot and two DIMM (or SO-DIMM) slots on Mini-ITX motherboards. This means that microATX allows dual-graphics card and quad-channel memory configurations.\n"}

Schaefer was convicted of two murders, but was suspected of many others. He frequently appealed against his conviction, but privately boasted, both verbally and in writing, of killing more than thirty women and girls. In December 1995, Schaefer was stabbed to death in his prison cell.\n\nGerard Schaefer was the first of three children born to Catholic parents, Gerard and Doris Marie (née Runcie) Schaefer. He was born in Wisconsin and was raised in Atlanta, Georgia, where he attended Marist Academy until 1960 when his family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Schaefer did not get along well with his father, who he believed favored his sister. \n\nIn his teens, he began an obsession with women's underwear and became a peeping tom, spying on a neighbor girl named Leigh Hainline, of whose subsequent murder he is suspected. Schaefer would later admit to killing animals in his youth and cross dressing, although at other times he claimed the latter was solely part of his successful attempt to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. \n\nAfter graduating from St. Thomas Aquinas High School in 1964, Schaefer went to college at Florida Atlantic University, and got married during that time. In 1969, he became a teacher at Plantation High School, but was soon fired for \"totally inappropriate behavior\", according to the principal. After being turned down from the priesthood, Schaefer turned to law enforcement as a career, graduating as a patrolman at the end of 1971 at age 25.\n\nOn July 21, 1972, Schaefer picked up two teenage girls who were hitchhiking while on patrol. He abducted them, took them to a remote forest and tied them to trees where he threatened to kill them or sell them into prostitution. However, Schaefer was called away on his police radio, leaving the girls tied up. He vowed that he would return.\n\nThe two girls, who were aged 17 and 18, escaped their bonds and went to the nearest police station, which was actually their kidnapper's own station. When Schaefer returned to the woods and found his victims gone, he called his station and claimed that he had done \"something foolish\", explaining that he had pretended to kidnap and threaten to kill two hitchhikers in order to scare them into avoiding such an irresponsible method of travel. Schaefer's boss did not believe him and he ordered Schaefer to the station, where he was stripped of his badge and charged with false imprisonment and assault.\n\nAfter posting bail, Schaefer was released. Two months later, on September 27, 1972, Schaefer abducted, tortured, and murdered Susan Place, aged 17, and Georgia Jessup, 16, and buried them in Oak Hammock Park in Port Saint Lucie, Florida. In December 1972, Schaefer appeared in court in relation to the July abductions. Due to a plea bargain, he was able to plead guilty to just one charge of aggravated assault, for which he received a sentence of one year.\n\nIn April 1973, over six months after they vanished, the decomposing, mutilated remains of Place and Jessup were found. The girls had been tied to a tree at some point and had vanished while hitchhiking. These similarities to Schaefer's treatment of the girls who had escaped led the police to obtain a search warrant for the house he and his wife shared with Schaefer's mother.\n\nIn Schaefer's bedroom, the police found lurid stories he had written that were full of descriptions of the torture, rape, and murder of women, whom he routinely referred to as \"whores\" and \"sluts\". More damningly, the authorities found personal possessions such as jewelry, diaries, and in one case, teeth from at least eight young women and girls who had gone missing in recent years. Some of the jewelry was from Leigh Hainline Bonadies, Schaefer's neighbor from when they were teenagers.\n\nBonadies had vanished in 1969 in Fort Lauderdale, after leaving a note for her husband saying she was making a short trip to Miami. Schaefer was never charged in connection with her case. Her skull, which was found to have multiple bullet holes, was discovered at a construction site in Palm Beach County in April 1978 and identified one month later.\n\nAlso among the items was a purse identified as belonging to Place. Place's mother later identified Schaefer as being the man she last saw with her daughter and Jessup. Schaefer was charged with the murders of Place and Jessup. In October 1973, he was found guilty and given two life sentences. Authorities soon stated that he was linked to around 30 missing women and girls.\n\nPlace and Jessup may not have been Schaefer's final victims; two 14-year-old girls named Mary Briscolina and Elsie Farmer vanished while hitchhiking on October 23, 1972, just a few weeks after Place and Jessup were killed. Their bodies were later recovered, and jewelry belonging to one of the girls was later found in Schaefer's home.\n\nSchaefer appealed his conviction, claiming at one point that he had been framed. All his appeals were rejected. Schaefer later began filing frivolous lawsuits, trying to sue one true crime writer, Patrick Kendrick, for describing him as \"an overweight, doughy, middle aged man who preyed on victims who were psychologically and physiologically weaker than him\", and separately trying to sue authors Sondra London, Colin Wilson and Michael Newton and former FBI agent Robert Ressler for describing Schaefer as a serial killer. \n\nIn support of her defense against the lawsuit, London compiled an exhibit of photocopies of 500 incriminating pages of his handwritten correspondence, and the judge dismissed Schaefer's complaint without further ado. After London provided copies of the 500-page exhibit to Newton and Wilson, Schaefer's lawsuits against them were also dismissed. Kendrick's suit was continued until Schaefer's own murder in prison. \n\nUntil his death Schaefer continued to threaten Sondra London. He also wrote threatening letters to Kendrick, suggesting he had willing agents who would do his bidding and that Schaefer \"would hate to see something happen to your family\". Kendrick went on to write fiction novels often describing brutal murders, which he relates to his experience with Schaefer.\n\nOn December 3, 1995, Schaefer was found stabbed to death in his cell. Fellow inmate Vincent Rivera was convicted in 1999 of killing Schaefer and had 53 years and ten months added to the life-plus-twenty years sentence he was already serving for double murder. Rivera did not confess to the crime, nor give a motive, although he did reveal highly relevant circumstances in correspondence he sent to Sondra London; to wit, Rivera had been an ear-witness to the prison murder of Frank Valdes in the second assault by corrections staff he sustained. Rivera had written a complaint about the first assault on Valdez, and was still held in the cell next to Valdez when the second beating killed him. Rivera was actively resisting the cover-up claiming Valdez had killed himself, filing multiple grievances and appeals, when he was accused of killing Schaefer. \n\nSchaefer's sister Sara told reporters that Schaefer's murder was a cover-up related to his attempts to verify the confession to the killing of Adam Walsh that Ottis Toole had made and then subsequently retracted. Sondra London declared it was more likely due to Schaefer informing on other inmates. In the year before his demise, Schaefer repeatedly had human wastes thrown at him, and had his cell set on fire twice. \n\nSchaefer made multiple statements to London, to the effect that he used his status as a \"death row law clerk\" to get confidential information from prisoners which found their way to the prosecutor's office, only to be used at trial against the inmates. Schaefer's classification officer stated to Sondra London that this was why Schaefer was under siege, because Schaefer's last attempt to curry favor with authorities had targeted an inmate who was well respected behind bars. \n\nOfficial sources put out the story that Vincent Rivera killed Schaefer in an argument over a cup of coffee, but after attending the murder trial and debriefing Rivera, Sondra London declared this story implausible, noting several little-known facts: a full-palm print in blood was found on the wall of Schaefer's cell, but when lab results failed to match it to either Schaefer or Rivera, the evidence was thrown out instead of being presented to the jury. Schaefer's body was found covered with boot prints, and expert testimony at Rivera's trial established that the patterns of the prints matched those of boots issued to corrections officers. It was further established that no prisoners were allowed to wear those particular boots. \n\nAt the time of Schaefer's death, Broward County homicide detective John King and homicide chief Tim Bronson were preparing to bring charges against Schaefer for three more unsolved murders to ensure he would never get out of prison.\n\n\nSondra London, a true crime writer who had been Schaefer's girlfriend in high school, interviewed him at length following his conviction, and published a compilation of his short stories and drawings entitled \"Killer Fiction\" in 1990. A second book, \"Beyond Killer Fiction\", followed two years later. Schaefer's stories typically involved savage, graphic torture and murder of women, usually from the perspective of the killer, who was often a rogue police officer. A revised edition of \"Killer Fiction\", released after Schaefer's death, included stories and rambling articles from the first two books and a collection of letters to London, in which Schaefer confessed to killing 34 women and girls, and bragged that he had impressed fellow inmate Ted Bundy.\n\nLondon noted that at the time Schaefer was corresponding with her, he was publicly proclaiming his innocence and threatening to sue anyone who labeled him a serial killer. In one letter, Schaefer wrote that he began murdering women in 1965, when he was 19. In another, he boasted of killing and cannibalizing two schoolgirls, nine-year-old Peggy Rahn and eight-year-old Wendy Stevenson, who vanished in December 1969. Publicly, Schaefer had denied any involvement.\n\nLondon ended her collaboration with Schaefer in 1991, after repudiating his story that he was merely a \"framed ex-cop\" who wrote lurid fiction. When she stated that he was indeed every bit the serial killer he simultaneously boasted of being, Schaefer allegedly repeatedly threatened her life and filed suit against her for calling him a serial killer in print.\n\n\n\n"}

She graduated high school early and started attending the University of Arkansas at Little Rock at the age of 16. She accelerated her education by taking classes year-round and in the summer, and by the age of 19, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in Psychology with three minors in English, Math and Biology. She continued her education further by earning a master's degree in Math.\n\nAs a young programmer, Bailey was hired by General Motors in 1978 and trained in assembly language programming. She worked there for two years on displays, and microprocessor-based cruise control systems. Bailey's first exposure to video games came from when she first heard the song \"Space Invader\" by The Pretenders. A friend told her the song was inspired by the arcade video game \"Space Invaders\". After becoming interested in what a video game was, her friend took her to a nearby bar which had a \"Space Invaders\" arcade cabinet. Bailey noticed that the display on \"Space Invaders\" resembled the display she worked with on the Cadillac at GM. She later found out that Atari was using the same microprocessor in its games. This inspired her to leave GM and move to Sunnyvale, California with the intention of working for Atari.\n\nIn 1980, Bailey joined Atari's coin-op division, where she was the only woman. In an interview, Bailey recalled that Atari had a notebook of possible game ideas at the time. Of the 30 or so entries the only one without \"lasering or frying things\" was a short description of a bug winding down the screen. She said, \"It didn't seem bad to shoot a bug\". Within a four-person team, she became the software developer and software engineer on \"Centipede\". Ed Logg, a supervisor at Atari at the time, assigned Bailey to do the programming on \"Centipede\". Logg said he worked on the game's design, while Bailey did \"about half the programming\". \"Centipede\" went on to become Atari's second best-selling coin-op game. Due to the game's popularity, Atari's production line was forced to run two shifts to keep up with demand. \n\n\"Centipede\" was also one of the first coin-op based arcade machines to have a significant female player base. This was intentional, as Logg and Bailey designed the game to appeal to a broad audience, not just male players. The game's vibrant pastel colors and the trackball-based gameplay appealed to both male and female players. \"Centipede\"’s unique color palette is credited to Bailey. While most games used bright colors, Bailey chose a pastel color palette for \"Centipede\", which was caused by a happy accident when the game’s technician was making adjustments to the game. Bailey said, “I was in front of the cabinet, watching the changes that were cycling through on the screen as he worked. Suddenly the regular primary colors on the screen changed to hot and vivid pastel colors I had never seen before, and I made a yip of approval and asked our technician to keep those colors.” After \"Centipede\", Bailey was working on a game titled \"Weather War\", but since processors at the time were so limited, she was unable to make the game include everything she wanted. Bailey left Atari before the game was finished.\n\nBailey left Atari in 1982 and went to work at Videa (later renamed Sente Technologies), founded by three former Atari employees. During her time at Videa, one of the games she worked on that never made it past the prototype phase, was a game that she called “The Glass Bead Game”, named after the Hermann Hesse novel by the same name. She later took PC contract roles for Activision, working on a two-person game with Paul Allen Newell. In 1985, after she left Activision, she decided to leave the video game industry altogether. \n\nIn 1997, Bailey moved back to Arkansas to take care of her aging parents. At 48 years old, Bailey earned two more master's degrees. Her first master's degree is in Education in Instructional Design, and her second master's degree is in Professional and Technical Writing. In 2007, she was the keynote speaker at the Women in Games International Conference. In 2008, Bailey joined the faculty in the department of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock where she taught until her retirement. In addition to writing classes, Bailey taught multimedia classes and the software 3DSMax.\n\nIn April 2013, Dona Bailey was a guest speaker at Indie Tech Talk, a lecture series presented by the Game Innovation Lab at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. In September 2015, she was a guest speaker at The Venture Center in Little Rock, Arkansas at their monthly technical speaker event, Code•IT! In November 2018, Dona Bailey was an honored guest speaker alongside Bonnie Ross, Brenda Laurel, Megan Gaiser, Amy Henning, Susan Jaekel, Jen MacLean, Sheri Graner Ray, and Victoria Van Voorhis at the \"Women in Games: Inspire!\" panel, as part of the first annual \"Women in Games\" exhibit at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. The panel was the opening event for the exhibit which celebrates the contributions of women in the video game industry. \n\nAs of 2019, Bailey had written a screenplay titled \"Sunnyvale\" based on her experiences at Atari as a programmer on \"Centipede,\" and is trying to get it picked up. She is also currently writing scripts for other narrative projects.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814905", "title": "Balancing lake", "text": "Balancing lake\n\nA balancing lake (also flood basin) is a term used in the U.K. describing an element of an urban drainage system used to control flooding by temporarily storing flood waters. The term balancing pond is also used, though typically for smaller storage facilities for streams and brooks.\n\nIn open countryside, heavy rainfall soaks into the ground and is released relatively slowly into watercourses (ditches, streams, rivers). In an urban area, the extent of hard surfaces (roofs, roads) means that the rainfall is dumped immediately into the drainage system. If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream. The function of a balancing lake is to contain this surge and release it slowly. Failure to do this, especially in older settlements without separate storm and foul sewers, can cause serious pollution as well as flooding.\n\nAt its simplest, a balancing lake can be constructed by creating a dam across a drain or stream at a convenient valley, with a restricted diameter outlet pipe through the dam. Normal flows are carried happily through the pipe, but heavy flows back up and the water behind the dam is choked back. Over the following few days, the level subsides. This is often enough for a small housing development.\n\nMore advanced systems are computer-controlled such that the entire flow of a river can be diverted into a holding lake, perhaps to reduce the impact of a large scale rainstorm in the catchment on communities downriver.\n\nFor aesthetic and safety reasons, the system can be designed so that there is a permanent lake. A lake with an equivalent area of 1,000 by 1,000 metres will hold a million cubic metres of water for each metre of depth. Typically such a lake would have an outer earth bank of 1 metre, then a leisure path, then a 10 cm inner bank to the steady-state level.\n\nA permanent lake can provide useful recreation facilities such as sailing, windsurfing, or of wildlife. These uses do not mix well, though a scheme can have both in linked basins where the recreational basin fills first and the wildlife basin is only used in exceptional conditions.\n\nWillen Lake () is one of the largest (400,000 m²) purpose-built stormwater balancing lakes in the UK. The lake is designed to take surface run-off from Milton Keynes, the largest of a number designed to do so. The lake has capacity for an additional level increase of 1.3 metres, equivalent to a once in 200 years event. Unlike most of the rest of the UK, the city has separate storm and foul sewers, so sewage pollution is not a significant problem.\n\nAdditionally, there are facilities to prevent accidental oil spills and the like from reaching the lake. As well as local storm drains, the lake's primary purpose is to intercept the river Ouzel, a tributary of the river Great Ouse. The catchment area is Oxford Clay that tends to get saturated easily, so field run-off has always been a problem.\n\nThe South Basin is designed for recreational use, mainly dinghy sailing and wind surfing, with a circumference path and banks as described above. It is linked to the North (Wildlife) Basin and can be drawn on to manage the level of the latter more finely. The North Basin has a large, undisturbed, central island. The extensive shallows support a good crop of aquatic plants and invertebrates. Very quickly, it became a key wildfowl site.\n\nIn winter, it attracts up to 2,500 wild birds, with a wide variety of migrating waders in spring and autumn. Common tern, tufted duck, ringed and little ringed plover, common redshank and northern lapwing. Canada geese have become naturalised and they are permanent residents. Both basins have deep ponds to maintain the fish population during droughts. The lake is managed as a public open space, receiving up to a million visits each year.\n\n\n"}

From 1885, until it was replaced by the Derbyshire Dales constituency in the 2010 general election, it elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post voting system. It was a safe Conservative seat for most of its existence.\n\nThis was the only really safe Conservative seat in Derbyshire, consisting mostly of rural villages and tourist towns like Bakewell and Matlock; Labour's only strengths were in Wirksworth and Masson, not enough to end the long-standing Conservative representation of this seat.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in Derbyshire, the Boundary Commission for England created a new constituency of Derbyshire Dales based on the existing West Derbyshire constituency.\n\nHistorically associated with the Cavendish family, the seat and its predecessors were usually represented by one of the future Dukes of Devonshire or their relatives from 1580 until the Second World War. When the Cavendish family left the Liberals over Irish Home Rule the seat stayed loyal to them as they sat first as Liberal Unionists then as Conservatives. In 1918 the hold on the constituency was briefly broken by Charles Frederick White standing for the Liberals, but the seat was regained in 1923. In a by-election in 1944, White's son, also called Charles Frederick White resigned as the official Labour nominee in order to stand against the wartime party truce. He defeated the Conservative candidate, William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, and subsequently took the Labour whip in the Commons, holding the seat in the 1945 general election for Labour.

Butterfat triglycerides contain the following amounts of fatty acids (by mass fraction):\n\nButterfat contains about 3% trans fat, which is slightly less than 0.5 grams per US tablespoon. Trans fats occur naturally in meat and milk from ruminants. The predominant kind of trans fat found in milk is vaccenic acid. Trans fats may be also found in some industrially produced foods, such as shortenings obtained by hydrogenation of vegetable oils. In light of recognized scientific evidence, nutritional authorities consider all trans fats equally harmful for health and recommend that their consumption be reduced to trace amounts.\nHowever, two Canadian studies have shown that vaccenic acid could be beneficial compared to vegetable shortenings containing trans fats, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total LDL and triglyceride levels. A study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol, whereas industrial trans fats only raise LDL with no beneficial effect on HDL.\n\nIn the U.S., there are federal standards for butterfat content of dairy products. Many other countries also have standards for minimum fat levels in dairy products.

Bidmead\n\nChristopher Hamilton Bidmead (born 18 January 1941) is a British writer and journalist.\n\nBidmead trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA), later playing several roles on stage, television and radio. By the early 1970s he was scriptwriting for Thames Television, producing material for \"Harriet's Back in Town\" and \"Rooms\". Up until 1979, he was a journalist. He had contributed some articles to \"New Scientist\".\n\nIn 1979, Robert Banks Stewart recommended him for the post of script editor on \"Doctor Who\". Bidmead was primarily responsible for a \"back to basics\" approach for his yearlong tenure on \"Doctor Who\", attempting to curb the more playful and fantasy oriented approach of his predecessor Douglas Adams in favour of a more naturalistic and scientific style of presentation. Most noticeable in the more serious portrayal of Tom Baker's Doctor, this approach proved controversial and ratings suffered, although this has been attributed to the tough timeslot for Bidmead's season which saw the show competing against \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" on ITV. Very much a product of its time, Bidmead's writings for \"Doctor Who\" demonstrate an increasing awareness of computer technology, typified by his complex serial \"Logopolis\" which served to write out the Fourth Doctor. After a year as script editor he returned to freelance work. This included writing two more \"Doctor Who\" serials for Peter Davison's Doctor (\"Castrovalva\" and \"Frontios\") as well as producing novelisations of all three of these \"Doctor Who\" stories.\n\nHe has continued his career in computer journalism, writing regularly (as Chris Bidmead) for \"Personal Computer World\", \"PC Plus\" and other computer magazines, and specialising in Linux tools. Occasionally he has contributed more speculative or philosophical pieces for publications such as \"New Scientist\", and recently he has worked as a journalist producing material for \"Wired\" magazine.\n\nIn August 2006, it was announced in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" that Bidmead would be writing a \"Doctor Who\" audio play, \"Renaissance of the Daleks\", for release through Big Finish Productions in March 2007. An audio play with that title was subsequently released, with a \"From a Story By\" credit for Bidmead. In recent years he has contributed voiceover commentaries and interviews for numerous DVD releases of \"Doctor Who\" serials with which he was involved.\n\nSubmitted on 19 June 1984, it would see the Doctor losing some of his memories throughout time. He would adapt the story to Big Finish Productions in June 2010.\n\nAlso known as \"The Last Adventure\", this four-part story, was submitted on 29 October 1986 as a \"Trial of a Timelord story\". The story would see the Doctor having been on trial by the Timelords, he was caught up in investigating the planet Pinacotheca, that has a museum of showing places and times in the universe entirely. \n"}

The group spans a distance of , has a total land area of approximately and is separated from the Papua New Guinea mainland by the wide Ward Hunt Strait in the north and the wide Goschen Strait in the south. D'Entrecasteaux Islands show signs of volcanism.\n\nThe inhabitants of D'Entrecasteaux Islands are indigenous subsistence horticulturalists living in small, traditional settlements. People of this area produced and traded clay pots as well as participated in the Kula exchange of shell valuables, travelling widely to other islands on sea-going sailing canoes. During the more recent past, people harvested copra, trochus and pearl-shells and some timber for cash. Alluvial gold mining was once important and in recent years the area has been subject to mineral exploration.\n\nThe three principal islands, from northwest to southeast, are Goodenough (Nidula), then across Moresby Straight to Fergusson (Moratau), the largest of the three, and across Dawson Straight to Normanby Island (Duau).\n\nIn addition there are numerous small islands and reefs. Sanaroa and Dobu are the most significant of the smaller islands, while Sori or Wild is named for HMS \"Challenger\"'s artist, John James Wild. The highest peak in the group is the Mount Vineuo on Goodenough Island.\n\nThe D'Entrecasteaux Islands are volcanically active, with a number of areas of historic/geologic volcanism and active geothermal fields. Fergusson Island has three volcanic masses over high. There are geothermal areas in the south east area of Goodenough Island and the Bwabwadana and Iamalele on Fergusson Island. A particularly active hot springs is located at Deidei on Fergusson.\n\nBetween Fergusson and Normanby Islands the Dawson Straights Group has several volcanic centres that may define a partly submerged caldera; one of the cones on southwestern Fergusson Island may have erupted in 1350. Geologically the islands are largely made up of rock that probably once belonged to the northern edge of the Australian plate that was thrust deep into the Earth's crust by plate collision. \n\nThe burial of these rocks to great depths (where they also encountered correspondingly high temperatures) metamorphosed the rocks to eclogite facies: >2GPa and >700˚C. Specifically, these islands play host to the youngest known coesite-eclogite sample; CA-TIMS dating of zircons within this sample dates its formation to ~5Ma, meaning it has been exhumed from a depth of ~100 km at the remarkable rate of ~20mm/yr. \n\nThe rock at the centre of the tall domes in these islands was thus recently very deep in the Earth. Over a very short time, geologically speaking, these packets of rocks have ascended through the Earth's shallow mantle and pushed through the crust to form the gneiss domes we find today – the vestiges of the crust these massifs have thrust through are still draped as carapaces over the edges of the domes.\n\nThese islands are thought to be geophysically significant because they lie immediately ahead of the west-most rift tip of the Woodlark spreading centre, which has been propagating westwards into the continent. The D'Entrecasteaux thus represent a stage of continental breakup just preceding fully-fledged volcanic spreading.\n\nThe group was named for the French navigator Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, who, in his ship the \"Espérance\", passed through the area in 1792 while searching for his missing compatriot, Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. Almost a century later, in 1874, Captain John Moresby of made a running survey of the west coast of the islands and became the first European to make landfall.\n\nIn 1891, the Methodist Church of Australia established a mission station on Dobu Island. There, natives were recruited to work in gold mines and on copra plantations. Another mission was established in 1898 at Bwaidoga, Mud Bay, on the south coast of Goodenough Island.\n\nThe island group became a focus of activity in World War II when Imperial Japanese troops were marooned on Goodenough Island briefly in 1942, before being attacked by the Australian 2/12th Battalion. In 1943 RAAF mobile works squadrons constructed an airfield with a airstrip and other facilities at Vivigani Airfield on the site of a smaller, pre-war airstrip that existed at that location. \n\nIt was used by allied forces from June 1943 to August 1944 as a staging point for operations in New Guinea and nearby occupied islands. Vivigani airstrip has been open to commercial service since 1963. A US Navy PT-Boat base was established on Fergusson Island in June 1942.\n"}

It first appeared as a b-side on the band's breakthrough \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" single in September 1991. A second studio version was released on the rarities compilation, \"Incesticide\", in December 1992.\n\nA live version, recorded on December 28, 1991, at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, was released as the first promotional single from the live compilation, \"From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah\", in 1996. It reached number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 13 on its Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nWritten in 1990, \"Aneurysm\" is one of the few Nirvana songs credited to all three members. It was first performed live on November 25, 1990, at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle, Washington. The first studio version was recorded on January 1, 1991, at Music Source in Seattle, Washington. The session was recorded by the band's audio engineer Craig Montgomery, and was their first with Grohl, who had joined Nirvana in September 1990. This version of the song was released as a b-side on the \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" single in September 1991, along with \"Even in His Youth,\" recorded at the same session. Both songs were re-released on the Australian and Japanese tour EP, \"Hormoaning\", in January 1992.\n\nA second studio version of \"Aneurysm\" was recorded by Miti Adhikari for the BBC program \"The Evening Session\" at Maida Vale Studios in London, England. It appeared on the band's rarities compilation \"Incesticide\" in December 1992, along with versions of \"Polly\" and \"Been a Son\" from the same session. Of the four songs recorded during the session, the band spent the longest working on \"Aneurysm,\" using fade-ins and fade-outs on the backing vocals during the verses to give the recording an \"unusual\" vocal effect, as described by author Gillian G. Garr, and overall \"lighter\" feel than the Music Source version.\n\nDespite never being released on a studio album, \"Aneurysm\" was a regular part of the band's setlist in 1991 and 1992. Its final performance was on August 6, 1993, at the King Cat Theatre in Seattle.\n\n\"Aneurysm\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of four minutes and thirty-five seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast rock tempo of 132 beats per minute. \"Aneurysm\" is composed in the key of B Minor, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and five notes, from a low of A to a high of F. The song has a basic sequence of F–C–B–A during the introduction, alternates between the chords of B and D in the verses and follows F–G–A–B–B–B–A at the refrain as its chord progression. Its arrangement begins with an extended introduction, opening with an echoed, descending guitar riff. The song's verses are structured around a simplistic, crunching two-chord sequence. Throughout the number, Cobain loudly snarls parodic lyrics insisting listeners to, \"Come on over, and do the twist.\" During the chorus, he delivers a rousing round of catchy chants. The song concludes with enigmatic praise for an unidentified woman: \"She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart.\"\n\nAccording to the 2001 Kurt Cobain biography \"Heavier Than Heaven\" by Charles R. Cross, Cobain wrote the lyrics to \"Aneurysm\" about his ex-girlfriend, musician Tobi Vail. Cobain's lyrics for the song make fun of pop conventions and drug-use rituals (\"shoot the shit\"), (\"beat me out of me\"). Cobain's lyrics for the song allude to the first time he spent time with Tobi, when he got so nervous he had to throw up: \"Love you so much, makes me sick!\" He also wrote it as a dark love song to try to get her back and to describe how the break-up devastated him: \"Come on over...do the twist, Overdo it...and have a fit!\"\n\nIn his \"AllMusic\" review of \"Incesticide\", Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \"Aneurysm\" was \"perhaps the greatest single song the group ever recorded.\" \"Allmusic's\"' Mark Deming wrote that the song \"may have been [Nirvana's] final grunge masterpiece\" before the release of their mainstream breakthrough \"Nevermind\" in September 1991, and described it as being characterized by \"big, loud rock riffs, pop culture parody, self-conscious self-disgust, and a finale worthy of a thousand upheld Bic lighters.\"\n\nIn 2013, \"Aneurysm\" was voted the seventh best Nirvana song in a \"Rolling Stone's\" reader's poll. In 2015, it was ranked at number 30 on \"Rolling Stones\"' \"No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked\" list. In 2019, \"The Guardian\" placed it at number six on their list of \"Nirvana's 20 greatest songs\", with Alex Petridis calling it \"every bit the equal of anything on \"Nevermind\".\"\n\nOn April 10, 2014, \"Aneurysm\" was performed by surviving Nirvana members Grohl, Novoselic and Pat Smear, with lead vocals by Kim Gordon, vocalist and bassist of the American indie rock band Sonic Youth, at Nirvana's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony at Barclays Centre in Brooklyn, New York. \"Rolling Stone\" named it one of the \"10 Best Cover Songs of 2014\", calling it a \"fitting\" end to the ceremony given Sonic Youth's role in helping Nirvana attain mainstream success, and writing that \"Kurt would've approved.\" Gordon discussed the performance in her 2015 autobiography \"Girl in a Band\", writing that \"Ontage, I was reminded that Kurt was the most intense performer I had ever seen ... I sang 'Aneurysm,' with its chorus, \"'Beat me out of me\",' bringing in all my own rage and hurt from the last few years - a four-minute-long explosion of grief, where I could finally let myself feel the furious sadness of Kurt's death and everything else surrounding it.\"\n\nIn 2017, to mark what would have been Cobain's 50th birthday, the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the top 20 most played Nirvana songs on television and radio in the UK, in which \"Aneurysm\" was ranked at number nine.\n\nA live version of \"Aneurysm,\" recorded on December 28, 1991, at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, appeared on the live compilation \"From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah\", released in October 1996. It was released as the album's first promotional single, peaking at number 11 on \"Billboard's\" Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 13 on \"Billboard's\" Alternative Songs chart.\n\nFootage of the band performing the song from the 1994 home video, \"Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!\", was used as a music video on \"MTV\" and \"MuchMusic\" for the Del Mar Fairgrounds version in 1996, to promote its release as a promo single. The \"Live! Tonight!! Sold Out!!\" version is an edit of two different live versions, from shows at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands on November 25, 1991, and the Hollywood Rock festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on January 23, 1993. No footage of the Del Mar Fairgrounds performance is known to exist.\n\nThe \"Aneurysm\" video reached number one on the Canadian \"MuchMusic Countdown\" in November 1996.\n\nNashville songwriter/producer Shane Tutmarc released an all electronic version of the song as a single, and music video, in 2013.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1815013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815013", "title": "Danish Crown Regalia", "text": "Danish Crown Regalia\n\nDanish Crown Regalia are the symbols of the Danish monarchy. They consist of three crowns, a Sceptre (symbolizing supreme authority), Globus cruciger (an orb symbolizing the earthly realm surmounted by a cross), the Sword of state and an Ampulla (symbolizing anointing of monarchs).\nThe Danish Royal Regalia are kept in the treasury at Rosenborg Castle. The oldest of these is Christian III's sword of state from 1551. They further include King Christian IV's diamond; pearl- and gold-embroidered saddles; objects carved from ivory and rock-crystal; lapidary pieces of precious stones, and brooches in the form of fantastic animals.\nDuring the time of the elective monarchs, the clergy and nobility placed the crown on the king's head at the coronation ceremony.\nAfter the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the crowning of the king was replaced by anointment, for which the king arrived in the church wearing the crown and was consecrated to his calling by being anointed with oil. For the anointing of Christian V, a new crown was made along with the Throne Chair of Denmark of narwhal teeth (supposedly the mythical unicorn's horn) and three silver lions, the latter created by Ferdinand Küblich (1664-1687). This was inspired by the biblical description of King Solomon's throne, which was said to be composed of unicorn's horn and gold and guarded by twelve golden lions.\n\nWith the 1849 Constitution, anointing was discontinued and since then the regalia have only been used on the occasion of a deceased monarch's \"Castrum doloris\" ('camp of woe') where the crown is placed on the coffin, the other regalia laid at casket's foot, and the casket surrounded by the three lions. The lions were formerly also displayed in Parliament during the annual opening session, but this tradition was discontinued almost 100 years ago. They were also displayed before the throne in the throne room of Christiansborg Palace when the Danish kings granted audiences on particularly formal occasions.\n\nThe \"crown jewels\" refer to four sets (parures) of jewellery owned by the state for an incumbent queen and is still worn by the Queen of Denmark.\n\nThe royal regalia, which symbolised the monarch's authority to rule, includes the crown of King Christian IV, which is a fine example of Renaissance guildwork, the better known crown of King Christian V and a smaller crown for the king's consort. The Royal Collection has other important items and jewels, as well as precious prayer-books, and items belonging to the Order of the Elephant and the Order of the Dannebrog (such as the large diamond and pearl star of the Order of the Elephant worn on the coronation mantle).\n\nThe term \"old regalia\" is used to describe the crown regalia used prior to the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660.\n\nThe crown was fashioned by Dirich Fyring (1580-1603) at Odense assisted by the Nuremberg goldsmith Corvinianus Saur during the years 1595-1596 for the coronation of Christian IV. It is made of gold, enamel, table cut gemstones and pearls and weighs 2895 g.\nThe circlet is ornamented with six sets of table cut diamonds between two large round pearls with enameled putti on either side. Between each of these sets are star-like ornaments of triangular and square table cut diamonds. On the upper rim of the circlet are six large and six small arabesque-like points. At the center of each of the larger points is an enameled allegorical figure of one of the king's ruling functions and virtues. The three points above the king's forehead and behind each of his ears bears a \"pelican in her piety.\" The point on the right of the king's forehead bears a representation of Fortitude riding a lion, while that on the left bears the image of Justice as a woman holding a sword and a pair of scales. The point above the back of the king's neck bears the traditional image of Charity as a mother suckling her child. On the inside these points are decorated with the coats of arms of various regions of the realm. The six smaller points each bears a star-like design in triangular and square table diamonds with a large pear shaped pearl at its top.\n\nOriginally an open crown, in 1648 it was closed with arches and an orb and cross, but Christian V later removed these again, using the diamonds and gold from them in the making of his own crown. It was used for the last time at the 1648 coronation of Frederick III.\n\nThe sword of state of Christian III was made in 1551 by Johann Siebe. It is made of gilded silver and decorated with enamel and table cut gemstones. Prior to the introduction of absolute monarchy, the sword was the first of the regalia presented to the king.\n\nThe sword was used for accolades and has a blue enamel grip decorated with diamonds.\n\nThis crown is the official crown that was used for the anointments of Danish absolute monarchs until the end of absolutism in 1849. The first Danish absolute monarch Frederick III wanted his son and heir-apparent, the later Christian V, to be in possession of the visible symbols of power at the moment he himself died and his son inherited the title. Therefore, he secretly commissioned several crown regalia, including a crown, to surround the anointing of the absolute monarchs with as much glory as possible.\n\nThe crown was first used for the coronation of Christian V and the last time for the coronation of Christian VIII in 1840. Today the crown is used as a symbol of the monarchy and the state. Its only ceremonial use is when it is placed on the Castrum doloris of a deceased monarch.\n\nThe crown is the visible sign of royal power and was made by the royal goldsmith Paul Kurtz in Copenhagen in the years 1670–1671. As the crown of the first absolute monarch it was made as a closed crown to look different than the open crowns of the elected kings, possibly inspired by the imperial crown of Charlemagne.\n\nThe circlet of the crown is divided in four by two large sapphires, a flat one that can be traced back to Frederick I at the forehead of the wearer (presumably a gift to his father, Christian I, from Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the Duke of Milan in 1474) and a thicker one at the back of the head and by a spinel at one side and a garnet at the other. The four curved segments of the circlet between these stones is decorated with volutes made of table cut diamonds.\n\nOn the upper edge of the circlet are eight acanthus leaves, four larger and four smaller ones. These acanthus leaves are decorated with diamond-studded ribs. The front acanthus leaf is decorated with a large table cut diamond with Christian V's royal cypher visible behind it. Attached to the backs of each of these acanthus leaves by screws are narrow diamond-studded half arches that meet at the top of the crown to support a sky blue-enameled sphere decorated with diamonds and with a diamond-studded cross on top. On the top of this cross is a cabochon ruby. The crown weighs 2080 g.\nThe queen-consort Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel was not crowned and did not wear a crown either because she belonged to the reformed church and was thus not a member of the Church of Denmark or because it was thought unnecessary to crown the queen since she had the right to wear any regalia through her marriage with the king.\n\nHowever all the following queens consorts of the absolute monarchs were crowned. Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the queen of king Frederick IV, was crowned with a queen's crown made for her, which was also used by Frederick IV to crown her successor Anna Sophie Reventlow. However Sophia Magdalen of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, the queen of king Christian VI, did not want to use the crown worn by her predecessor and had a new crown made by royal jeweler Frederik Fabritius (1683-1755) in 1731. This crown is made like that of Christian V but only taller and more slender. It is decorated with table cut diamonds that are assumed to come from the 1648 crown of Queen Sophie Amalie.\n\nThe sceptre was made by an unknown Copenhagen goldsmith for the coronation of Frederick III in 1648. It is made of gold and ends in an elongated enameled knob at the bottom decorated with diamond-studded ribs and an enameled lily at the top with a royal crown above it.\n\n The Globus cruciger symbolizes Christian world supremacy. It is a golden globe decorated with a band of enamel and diamonds. On top of this is a half-circle of enamel and diamonds. It is topped by a diamond-studded cross. It was made in Hamburg for the coronation of Frederick III in 1648.\n\nThe sword of state symbolizes the protecting, punishing and judging authority of the king. The sword was originally a wedding present from Christian IV to the 1643 wedding of Frederick III. It was used for the anointing of all absolute monarchs and probably also for the coronation of Frederick III.\n\nIts cross-guard and grip is decorated with gemstones. The scabbard has a diamond-studded Chape, is covered in red velvet and is decorated with the coats of arms of different parts of the realm. Above each coat of arms is a small diamond-studded crown.\n\nThe ampulla, used to contain the anointing oil, is a gold cylinder and its lid enameled with a variety of flowers and studded with table cut diamonds made by an unknown Copenhagen goldsmith for the coronation of Frederick III in 1648.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815052", "title": "Pteridospermatophyta", "text": "Pteridospermatophyta\n\nThe term Pteridospermatophyta (or \"seed ferns\" or \"Pteridospermatopsida\") refers to several distinct polyphyletic groups of extinct seed-bearing plants (spermatophytes). The earliest fossil evidence for plants of this type is the genus \"Elkinsia\" of the late Devonian age. They flourished particularly during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous Period, though some pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times, based on fossil finds in Tasmania.\n\nThe concept of pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century when palaeobotanists came to realise that many Carboniferous fossils resembling fern fronds had anatomical features more reminiscent of the modern-day seed plants, the cycads. In 1899 the German palaeobotanist Henry Potonié coined the term \"\"Cycadofilices\"\" (\"cycad-ferns\") for such fossils, suggesting that they were a group of non-seed plants intermediate between the ferns and cycads. Shortly afterwards, the British palaeobotanists Frank Oliver and Dukinfield Henry Scott (with the assistance of Oliver's student at the time, Marie Stopes) made the critical discovery that some of these fronds (genus \"Lyginopteris\") were associated with seeds (genus \"Lagenostoma\") that had identical and very distinctive glandular hairs, and concluded that both fronds and seeds belonged to the same plant. Soon, additional evidence came to light suggesting that seeds were also attached to the Carboniferous fern-like fronds \"Dicksonites\", \"Neuropteris\" and \"Aneimites\". Initially it was still thought that they were \"transitional fossils\" intermediate between the ferns and cycads, and especially in the English-speaking world they were referred to as \"seed ferns\" or \"pteridosperms\". Today, despite being regarded by most palaeobotanists as only distantly related to ferns, these spurious names have nonetheless established themselves. Nowadays, four orders of Palaeozoic seed plants tend to be referred to as pteridosperms: Lyginopteridales, Medullosales, Callistophytales and Peltaspermales.\n\nTheir discovery attracted considerable attention at the time, as the pteridosperms were the first extinct group of vascular plants to be identified solely from the fossil record. In the 19th century the Carboniferous Period was often referred to as the \"Age of Ferns\" but these discoveries during the first decade of the 20th century made it clear that the \"Age of Pteridosperms\" was perhaps a better description.\n\nDuring the 20th century the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds, such as the Corystospermaceae. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as the Glossopteridales and Gigantopteridales, which was stretching the concept. In the context of modern phylogenetic models, the groups often referred to as pteridosperms appear to be liberally spread across a range of clades, and many palaeobotanists today would regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group' with no common lineage. One of the few characters that may unify the group is that the ovules were borne in a cupule, a group of enclosing branches, but this has not been confirmed for all \"pteridosperm\" groups.\n\nWith regard to the enduring value of the division, many palaeobotanists still use the pteridosperm grouping in an informal sense to refer to the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites). This is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups whose systematic relationships remain speculative, as they can be classified as pteridosperms with no valid implications being made as to their systematic affinities. Also, from a purely curatorial perspective the term pteridosperms is a useful shorthand for describing the fern-like fronds that were probably produced by seed plants, which are commonly found in many Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras.\n\nAn alternative phylogeny of spermatophytes based on the work by Novíkov & Barabaš-Krasni 2015 with plant taxon authors from Anderson, Anderson & Cleal 2007 showing the relationship of extinct clades.\n\n\n"}

Belli, with his mother and his two brothers, moved back to Rome, where they were forced to take cheap lodgings in Via del Corso. Belli began his poetical career initially by composing sonnets in Italian, at the suggestion of his friend, the poet Francesco Spada.\n\nAfter a period of employment in straitened circumstances, in 1816 he married a woman of means, Maria Conti, and this enabled him the ease to develop his literary talents. The two had a son, Ciro, born in 1824. Belli made some trips to Northern and Central Italy, where he could come in contact with a more evolved literary world, as well with the Enlightenment and revolutionary milieu which was almost totally absent in Rome, where a strong social cohesion had made the almost anarchoid population completely independent from and indifferent to political ideologies. It was during a stay in Milan that he came in touch with the rich local tradition of dialect poetry and satire, as modernized by Carlo Porta, whose witty vernacular sonnets provided him with a model for the poems in Roman dialect that were to make him, posthumously, famous.\n\nHis sonnets were often satirical and anti-clerical, as when he defined the Cardinals as 'dog-robbers', for example, or Pope Gregory XVI as someone who kept 'Rome as his personal inn'. Nevertheless, Belli's political ideas remained largely conservative throughout his life. During the democratic rebellion of the Roman Republic of 1849 he defended the rights of the pope.\n\nAfter his wife's death in 1837, Belli's economic situation worsened again. In later years Belli lost much of his vitality, and he felt a growing acrimony against the world around him, describing himself as \"a dead poet\". Consequently, his poetical production dropped off and his last sonnet in dialect dates to 1849.\n\nIn his later years Belli worked as artistical and political censor for the papal government. Works whose circulation he denied included those of William Shakespeare, Giuseppe Verdi and Gioachino Rossini.\n\nHe died in Rome in 1863 from a stroke. His nephew, painter Guglielmo Janni, wrote a monumental biography in 10 volumes, which was published posthumously in 1967.\n\nBelli is mainly remembered for his vivid popular poetry in the Roman dialect. He produced some 2,279 sonnets that form an invaluable document of the 19th century's papal Rome and the life of its common people. They were mainly composed in the period 1830–1839. Belli kept them largely hidden, apart from his famous recitals before friends such as Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Nikolai Gogol and, just before his death, asked his friend Monsignor Vincenzo Tizzani to burn them. Fortunately, the prelate gave them back to Ciro Belli, who when first publishing a selection of them in 1866, severely edited them in order not to offend the taste of the time.\n\nBelli came to Roman from Italian, as an educated and intelligent user of the language, and his Letters, recently published, represent some of the finest Italian style of the period. He regarded his Roman sonnets in something of the light of an anthropologist, expressing what he saw of the mood, experience and opinions of the Roman lower classes, and his felicity with the Roman language depended on an already acquired felicity with Italian that was very rare in his time.\n\nThe most striking characteristics of Belli's sonnets are the overwhelming humour and the sharp, relentless capability of satirization of both common life and the clerical world that oppressed it. Some of the sonnets, moreover, show a decided degree of eroticism. Although replete with denunciations of the corruption of the world of the Roman Church, and of 19th century Rome in general, Belli's poems have been defined as \"never impious\". His verse is frequently obscene, emphasizing the exuberant vulgarity and acerbic intuitions of the local world whose language he employed, but is always phrased with an acute technical mastery of rhythm within the difficult formal structures of the Petrarchan sonnet, and by a sense of realism which was rarely matched in the poetical production of Europe, until the emergence of raw realism with Émile Zola and James Joyce.\n\nA selection of Belli's sonnets were translated into English by Anthony Burgess, who employed a rough slang tinged with Lancastrian as a stand-in for Belli's Roman dialect. These translations appear in the novel \"ABBA ABBA\", which deals with a fictional encounter between Belli and John Keats, and are excerpted in \"Revolutionary Sonnets and Other Poems\". Belli's works have also been translated by the poet Harold Norse.\n\nAmong other English translators of Belli's work are Peter Nicholas Dale, William Carlos Williams, and Eleonore Clark. Robert Garioch has rendered a selection of his sonnets, very appropriately, into Edinburgh demotic.\n\n"}

Brooks's portrayal of Janine has awarded Brooks with numerous awards, since her first appearance in 1999, with storylines involving cocaine addiction, prostitution and murder. Brooks has appeared in British television shows; \"The Bill\", \"Wired\" and \"Bleak House\". Brooks released a fitness DVD, \"\"Before And After Workout\"\", before winning the 2011 version of the \"Strictly Come Dancing\" Christmas Special and the twelfth series of \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\".\n\nBrooks was born in 1981, in Ware, Hertfordshire, England, and moved to Barmouth, Wales when she was a child. \nBrooks attended Tower House School, in Barmouth, and relocated to London to attend Ravenscourt Theatre School.\n\nIn television, Brooks has appeared in episodes of \"The Bill\", \"London's Burning\", \"Jonathan Creek\" and \"The Demon Headmaster\".\nWhen executive producer Matthew Robinson re-introduced Janine in 1999, after Alexia Demetriou left, Brooks secured the role.\n\nAfter her departure from \"EastEnders\" in 2004, Brooks first role was in the BBC drama \"Bleak House\" as Jenny. Brooks has done various commercials and voiceovers in the United Kingdom, Europe and the US.\n\nIn 2006, Brooks played Beverley Allitt in a BBC1 docu-drama called \"Beverley Allitt: Angel of Death\", alongside Ian Kelsey. Producer Cathy Elliot said, \"It's a very sensitive issue and of course it's terrible for the parents to have the whole thing brought up. Each time it's brought up it's painful, but a lot of parents realise it's important it's kept in the public domain and that people are aware that things have happened and that not a lot has been done since\".\n\nShe has guest starred in \"Robin Hood\" and \"Love Soup\". In theatre, Brooks, whilst on a break from \"EastEnders\" in 2003, appeared in the play \"Office Games\" alongside Adam Rickitt. The play was Brooks' west end debut, and was described as \"a witty and intelligent political commentary\". In 2007 she appeared in \"Our Country's Good\" at the Liverpool Playhouse.\n\nIn 2008, Brooks returned to \"EastEnders\" for a guest stint. She was later confirmed to be coming back as a regular character. She said, \"I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on \"EastEnders\" can be, and then there's that stigma about going back to a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief\". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, \"I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining \"EastEnders\". With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine\". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.\n\nIn January 2019 it was announced that Alex Oates's play All in a Row, starring Charlie Brooks as Tamora, the mother, was going to be produced by Paul Virides Productions at the Southwark Playhouse. The play is based on Alex's ten years of experience caring for severely autistic children and adults and won the Top Five Play Reading at the Bolton Octagon. The play is about the parents of a profoundly autistic eleven year old boy and how they're feeling the night before he is taken to a residential school because social services feel he needs more support than can be given in their family home.\n\nCriticisms of the play started to emerge when a video trailer for the production was released showing the autistic character, Laurence, portrayed by a puppet, with Frances Ryan, without seeing it, criticising the play by calling it a \"grotesque step backwards\". The National Autistic Society who initially decided to help the production by providing consultation reacted to the twitter furore by releasing a statement saying \"while recognising some of the play's strengths, we decided we could not support the play overall due to its portrayal of autism, particularly the use of a puppet to depict the autistic character alone.\" Brooks responded by saying that \"I understand people's concerns, but I do urge people to come and see the play first before they judge.\" She also claimed that having a puppet character is essential and that Laurence, the puppet, is very playful. During rehearsals Brooks visited the Queensmill School for autistic children in Shepherd's Bush and talked to the pupils there, their teachers and their carers. Brooks concluded by stating \"This is a story that is rarely told. I just hope people will come and see it instead of sitting at home getting angry.\"\n\nShe won \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" in 2012, beating campmate Ashley Roberts. Brooks was \"visibly delighted\" saying, \"[It feels] silly. I never imagined this for a million years. Everyone's been amazing\". Brooks also narrates Botched Up Bodies on Channel 5.\n\nHer fitness DVD became the UK's best-selling fitness DVD release, and Brooks was transformed from \"podgy Janine to a sexy new mum\".\n"}

He was a pupil of T. C. Farrar in New York, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dresden. After four months of study in Dresden, at the recommendation of James Whistler he went to London to study with that artist. However, on arriving there, he was recalled to New York to help deal with family financial problems. He gave drawing lessons for a year, and, the family's financial situation having improved, he returned to London to study with Whistler. He felt neglected by this master, however, and soon moved on. From 1870 to 1873, he studied under Ford Madox Brown and Edward Coley Burne-Jones in England, and worked in the school of William Morris, where he devoted particular attention to stained glass.\n\nHis family's financial situation again recalled him to New York in 1873. He taught painting at Cooper Institute, became known as an illustrator, painted portraits, designed stained glass, and subsequently confined himself to decorative work. He designed the chancel of Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts, and decorated the interior of Bowdoin College chapel, at Brunswick, Maine, and several churches in New York. The Marquand memorial window, in the former Marquand chapel at Princeton, New Jersey (destroyed 1920), was an example of his work in stained glass. His last work was a series of medallions for the building of the Hispanic-American Society in New York.

He refused to be substituted and played on to set up three of Wigan's tries. Despite his performance, the Man Of The Match award went to his half back partner Andy Gregory. He played in Wigan's 1991 World Club Challenge victory over Sydney's Penrith Panthers.\n\nEdwards finished the 1991–92 season as the league's leading try scorer with a total of 40.

He matched Wigan's record for most tries in a single match (10) in the 78-0 rout of Swinton in the Lancashire County Cup 2nd round in September 1992. It was a County Cup record and record for a non-winger in any game. In addition he scored four tries in a game on four occasions and hat-tricks seven times. During the 1992–93 season Edwards played at scrum half for defending RFL champions Wigan in the 1992 World Club Challenge against the visiting Brisbane Broncos. He played in Wigan's 1994 World Club Challenge win over the Brisbane Broncos in Australia which attracted a World Club Challenge record attendance of 54,220.\n\nEdwards played in every round of Wigan's eight consecutive Challenge Cup wins.

He fell out with new coach Eric Hughes, who refused Edwards permission to miss the first training session of each week, in order for him to spend time with his son in London. The decision to allow Edwards to leave the club led to multiple complaints from Wigan fans.\nAfter just a season in London, Edwards moved to Bradford Bulls but after only a few months returned to London where he led the London Broncos to the 1999 Challenge Cup final at Wembley.

{"id": "1815131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815131", "title": "Frankford, Philadelphia", "text": "Frankford, Philadelphia\n\nFrankford is a neighborhood in the Northeast section of Philadelphia situated about six miles (10 km) Northeast of Center City. Although its borders are vaguely defined, the neighborhood is bounded roughly by the original course of Frankford Creek on the south to Adams Avenue on the southwest, to Roosevelt Boulevard on the west border to Bridge Street on the north to the Trenton Line on the east. Adjacent neighborhoods are Bridesburg, Kensington, Juniata, Oxford Circle, Summerdale, and Wissinoming. Historically, Frankford had an unofficial division separating Frankford (proper) from East Frankford encompassing the area east of Frankford Avenue. The division divided the community first along racial lines, with African Americans on the east of Frankford Avenue and Caucasians to the west. As the community has become less homogeneous, the division is more of a vestige of the past.\n\nIn 2005, the 19124 ZIP code, which roughly contains Frankford and Juniata, had a median home sale price of $81,075, an increase of 22% over 2004.\nThe village of Frankford was established by the Quakers in about 1682 in an area already occupied by Swedes and Germans. The land known as the Manor of Frank was purchased by the Society of Free Traders, a group of Quaker businessmen in England. The original settlers were Henry Waddy, Thomas Fairman, Robert Adam and Edward Seary. The village very likely took its name from the title of the Frankfurt Company, which took up ground there, along what is now known as Frankford Creek, in the lower part of Oxford Township. Frankford Creek's upper tributaries were the Tacony Creek and the Wingohocking Creek. Frankford was an early suburb of the town of Philadelphia. William Penn forged a trail through the village running from the original town (now Center City) to New York City, passing through Bucks County near the site of his home, Pennsbury Manor. That trail came to be known as \"Frankford Pike\" (later Frankford Avenue) and was the town's main street.\n\nThe village was incorporated into a borough on March 2, 1800, bounded by Leiper Street on the northwest, Little Tacony (or Tackawanna) Creek on the south and east, and Frankford Creek on the west. By act on April 4, 1831, the boundaries of the borough were extended to include land to the northwest of Leiper Street, the line running along Harrison and Horrocks Streets, to a point on Frankford Creek below Wyoming Avenue. In 1853, the part of Whitehall Borough lying between Torresdale and Frankford Avenues below what is now Whitehall Common was added, to encompass a total of 1.468 square miles. In 1854, the borough was annexed by the city of Philadelphia through the Act of Consolidation, 1854.\n\nFrankford was historically a manufacturing center, beginning with a gristmill constructed in the 1660s. This same mill became famous during the American Revolutionary War due to the heroics of Lydia Darrah.\n\nBefore and during the Revolution, two lesser-known grist-mills operated on the creek above the town of Frankford.\n\nIn 1771, Robert Morris (a miller) purchased a mill at the junction of the Tacony Creek and Frankford Creek.\n\nOn November 25, 1773, after receiving permission to dam the creek from a Quaker named Nicholas Waln, a feme-sole trader named Mary Peters also established a small grist mill. She was in a partnership with Richard Whitman of Oxford Township, Philadelphia County.\n\nFrankford also has the distinction of having played a role in the Declaration of Independence. \"There is also a tradition that on the afternoon of that day, or possibly a day or two earlier, there was a joyful private celebration of the great event, by Jefferson and others, at the garden-house of a country-seat in Frankford (near Philadelphia), then occupied by Dr. Enoch Edwards, a leading patriot of that time.\"\n\nFrankford was also the site of a gunpowder mill that became famous because of its association with Oswald Eve and Paul Revere.\n\nIn the 19th century, the town became a center for textile production. Other manufacturing industries also flourished. An early description of industry in 1837:\nThe borough of Frankford, on the Delaware, is the seat of numerous manufacturing establishments, including several cotton-mills, calico print-works and bleacheries, woollen-mills, iron-works, & etc. Here are also an Arsenal of the United States, and a Lunatic Asylum belonging to the Friends.\nThe Frankford Arsenal rivaled the Philadelphia Navy Yard during World War II. It provided over 22,000 jobs and at its peak, produced 8 million bullets per day.\n\nIn 1922, the Frankford Elevated Line opened, connecting to the Market Street Elevated to provide rapid-transit access to Center City and West Philadelphia. The terminus of today's SEPTA Market-Frankford Line, now known as the Frankford Transportation Center, became a major transit hub, with connections to bus and trolley routes extending into Northeast Philadelphia. Residents of Frankford live within walking distance of the terminal. SEPTA's elevated train (the \"El\") runs through the neighborhood above Frankford Avenue.\n\nAlthough the Frankford Line helped to catapult Frankford Avenue into a major shopping district in the early 20th century, the traditionally working-class neighborhood saw decline in the 1950s as many Philadelphians moved to the suburbs. White flight eventually took its hold on the neighborhood throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By 1990, over 30% of the storefronts on Frankford Avenue were vacant. Since this time, Frankford has seen a push for improvement. In 1993, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission adopted the \"Frankford Plan\" as a blueprint for revitalizing the neighborhood. Although many vacant storefronts remain, businesses catering to new customers have opened in recent years.\n\nMany business owners hope that gentrification of neighborhoods such as Fishtown and Kensington will spread north into Frankford. Others worry that previous attempts at improving Frankford have not been as effective as hoped, with most areas of the neighborhood still suffering from street crime and open-air drug sales. Between 1985 and 1990, a serial killer known as the \"Frankford Slasher\" murdered several women in the neighborhood; although several suspects were taken into custody, the actual killer has never been identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the bounds of Frankford exists an enclave known as Northwood. Northwood is made up almost entirely of pre-World War II twin and single-family dwellings. Northwood is bounded by Harrison Street to the south, Roosevelt Boulevard to the west and Oxford Avenue to the east, its northernmost point being Sanger Street, just below the intersection of Castor Avenue, Roosevelt Blvd (U.S. 1) and Oxford Avenue. However, a more broad definition of Northwood would extend to Adams Avenue on the south, including the location of Northwood Park and the larger mansions on Castor Avenue south of Harrison Street.\n\nThree of Frankford's schools lie within Northwood. Other facilities in Northwood include Frankford High School's War Memorial Stadium, built in honor of area residents who served in World War I, and Baldwin Field, named for Matthias W. Baldwin of the former Baldwin Locomotive Works and his family.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to a mostly middle-class population. The neighborhood was also home to former Philadelphia mayor and Representative from the 5th (then 3rd) Congressional District William J. Green, III, and the late Edward Roy Becker, former justice on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for the United States.\n\nIn 1881, Alfred and Louis Burk founded Louis Burk, Inc., Philadelphia meat packers, and also built the original Atlantic City Steel Pier in 1898. Several other brothers were engaged in this family-run business. (Another brother, Henry Burk, was a well-known local politician.)\n\nAs real-estate investors and developers in Philadelphia, they bought and sold large parcels of land in Northwood. To protect the integrity of the neighborhood, Louis Burk placed several various deed restrictions upon many of the tracts he sold.

In particular Frankford High School has been the community's public high school since 1910. In addition to public schools, Frankford Friends School, a private Pre-Kindergarten through 8th grade school, is in Frankford . The Free Library of Philadelphia also operates the Frankford Branch in the neighborhood.\n\nThe community was the home of the Frankford Yellow Jackets, a National Football League team that won the championship in 1926 but folded in 1931. Frankford is also home to the N.E. Frankford Boys and Girls Club American Legion Post 224 Drill Team, who won the AMA Nationals Championship in 2005 and 2006. Also part of the community for decades was the Frankford Boys Club. It was an organization that gave Frankford youth an opportunity to learn how to play football, baseball and basketball as part of NESAC. The Boys Club was one of NESAC flagship organizations and participated in many playoff games and championship victories.\n\n\n"}

He is the head coach for Ireland following the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He is the father of England rugby union player Owen Farrell.\n\nA dual-code international, Farrell was a goal-kicking in rugby league. He captained Great Britain, and his club, Wigan Warriors. Farrell made 34 appearances for Great Britain and represented England in two World Cups. He won six Championships and four Challenge Cups with Wigan, as well as numerous individual awards between 1991 and 2004.\n\nIn rugby union he played for Saracens from 2005 to 2009 and won eight caps for England, including playing in the 2007 World Cup. After retiring as a player, Farrell continued in rugby union as a coach, working as an assistant coach with Saracens and Munster, as well as England, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions.\n\nFarrell was born in Wigan, Greater Manchester and first played rugby league at age 10 at a summer camp run by Graeme West, Wigan Warriors' captain at the time. Farrell is of Irish descent. After developing with local club Orrell St James, he made his first-team début for his hometown club Wigan at the age of 16 in 32-8 victory over Keighley in the 1991–92 Regal Trophy match at Central Park, Wigan on Sunday 24 November 1991. Also that year his son Owen Farrell was born, who also went on to become a professional rugby union player.\n\nFarrell became the youngest player to win a Challenge Cup Final in 1993 when at 17 years and 11 months he came on as a substitute against Widnes. He then became a full international by the age of 18, making his début against New Zealand later in 1993.\n\nAfter the 1993–94 Rugby Football League season, during which he scored a try in Wigan's Challenge Cup Final victory, Farrell travelled with his club to Brisbane and played as a in their 1994 World Club Challenge victory over Australian premiers, the Brisbane Broncos. He rates this as one of his greatest achievements in rugby league. Farrell was selected to play for Great Britain against Australia in all three Ashes Tests of the 1994 Kangaroo tour. The following year he played from the bench for Wigan in the 1995 Challenge Cup Final victory over Leeds Rhinos. At the end of the season he played as a for England in the 1995 World Cup Final, but Australia won the match and retained the Cup. Also that year, Farrell married the elder sister of future Great Britain international and Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin.\n\nIn July 1996 Farrell was appointed Wigan Warriors' captain and later that year, aged 21 years and four months, became the youngest-ever captain of the Great Britain team, leading the 1996 Lions tour of New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. In October that year he won the prestigious Man of Steel Award. He was also named at in 1996's Super League Dream Team. On 28 September 1997 in the 1997 Super League Premiership Final, Farrell played at in Wigan's 33–20 win over St. Helens at Old Trafford before a crowd of 33,389. He was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man-of-the-match. In the 1997 post-season, Farrell was selected to captain Great Britain at in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. He captained the Wigan Warriors as a in their 1998 Super League Grand Final victory over Leeds Rhinos.\n\nFarrell played for the Wigan Warriors at , scoring a try and kicking two goals, in their 2000 Super League Grand Final defeat by St. Helens. In the post-season he was selected to captain England in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. In 2001 Farrell set the Wigan club record for most points in a season with 429 and most points in a Super League championship season with 388. He is only the second Wigan Warriors player to score more than 3,000 points in all competitions. Farrell played for the Wigan Warriors at in their 2001 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Bradford Bulls. He celebrated his testimonial match in 2002 and also captained Wigan to victory in the 2002 Challenge Cup.\n\nFarrell played for Wigan Warriors at and kicked two goals in the 2003 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Bradford Bulls. He was inducted into the Order of the British Empire for services to the game in the New Year's list of 2004. He won the Players' Player Award and twice won the Man of Steel Award. Now Britain's oldest international, Farrell was then selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end-of-season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played at , missing his only goal-kick in the Lions' 4-44 loss. Farrell was awarded the Golden Boot as the best player in the world in 2004. He retired while second on the list of the England rugby league side's all-time top goal scorers (behind George Fairbairn), with 78 points.\n\nOn 24 March 2005 Farrell announced his retirement from rugby league in order to play at Saracens, and the Rugby Football Union. A series of injuries and accidents (including a car crash) meant that his début in the 15-man code was delayed until 2006. He finally made a try-scoring début for Saracens reserves on 11 September 2006. Farrell then made his first-team début against Newcastle Falcons on 17 September 2006 as a replacement. On both occasions he played as blind-side flanker. A row then broke out about his best position: the England management suggested he should be playing in the centre, whilst Saracens continued to play him as a flanker. However Farrell went on to play primarily at centre for the Saracens first team, and again when selected to play for a World XV against South Africa. He was selected as a part of the England Elite squad for the 2007 Six Nations by new coach Brian Ashton. He was seen by some to be the main contender for the starting inside centre position, after England's problems in that position during the 2006 autumn internationals.\n\nFarrell made his England début at Twickenham after he was named at inside centre in the first Six Nations game against Scotland. The 2007 World Cup saw Farrell starting at inside centre against South Africa, in England's chastening group stage defeat. He was then brought on as a replacement against Tonga, and scored his first England try. However, after being picked for the quarter-final decider against Australia he had to withdraw with a calf injury. Unfortunately he never produced the performances for the England union side for which many had hoped, and ultimately he won only eight caps. In January 2008 Farrell was joined at Saracens by his 16-year-old son Owen Farrell, who signed a three-year academy deal with the club. In August 2008 Farrell was named co-captain for the 2008–09 season along with Steve Borthwick. There were rumours of Farrell returning to rugby league and rejoining Wigan Warriors, after it emerged that Saracens head coach Eddie Jones had become unhappy with the direction his club was taking. It was rumoured that Jones and Farrell could be moving up north, with the Warriors becoming increasingly impatient with out-of-favour Brian Noble especially after their poor start to the season; however this proved to be unfounded, with the Warriors instead hiring Melbourne Storm assistant coach Michael Maguire. In April 2009 Farrell announced his retirement and said he was taking up a coaching role with Saracens at the end of the season.\n\nFarrell was promoted to Saracens first-team coach at the end of 2010 after impressing as skills coach. The RFU announced on 8 December 2011 that both he and Graham Rowntree were to join the national coaching team, led by Stuart Lancaster, for the 2012 Six Nations championship. After the successful campaign Farrell was given the chance to become a permanent part of the England coaching team, but decided to return to Saracens. However, Farrell soon left the London club and the RFU announced on 28 June 2012 that he would join the England coaching team on a three-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nFarrell toured with the British and Irish Lions in 2013 as defence coach, having proved himself with England. He was heavily praised by head coach Warren Gatland, having drilled the team to concede very few points during the 10-match tour.\n\nOn 15 December 2015, following the resignation of head coach Stuart Lancaster on 11 November 2015, newly appointed head coach Eddie Jones sacked Farrell along with the rest of the coaching team.\n\nOn 6 January 2016 it was announced that Farrell would take up the role of Ireland defence coach after the completion of the 2016 Six Nations Championship. As his previous contract with England prevented him from working with an international team until April 2016, Farrell joined Irish province Munster in January 2016 in a temporary advisor role that was to last for four months.\n\nOn 26 November 2018 it was announced that Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt would step down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup with Farrell taking over as head coach.\nHis first game in charge was against Scotland at the Aviva Stadium on 1 February 2020 in the 2020 Six Nations Championship, which Ireland won 19-12.\n\nFarrell married Colleen in 1995.\n\nPrevious clubs: Orrell St. James\n\nSuper League record at Wigan Warriors 1996–2004 \n\n"}

Pottenger Jr. (1901–1967) was the son of Francis M. Pottenger Sr., the physician who co-founded the Pottenger Sanatorium for treatment of tuberculosis in Monrovia, California. \n\nHe completed his residency at Los Angeles County Hospital in 1930 and became a full-time assistant at the Sanatorium. From 1932 to 1942, he also conducted what became known as the Pottenger Cat Study. \n\nIn 1940, he bought some of the cottages from the Monrovia sanatorium and founded the Francis M Pottenger Jr. Hospital. Until closing in 1960, the 42-bed hospital specialized in treating non-tubercular diseases of the lung, especially asthma.\n\nOne particular question that Pottenger addressed in his study had to do with the nutritive value of heat-labile elements – nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods.\n\nHe applied the principles of nutrition and endocrinology early in his practice. Dr. Pottenger was a pioneer in using crude extracts of adrenal cortex as supplements to treat allergic states and exhaustion. In his treatment of respiratory diseases such as TB, asthma, allergies and emphysema, he always highlighted proper diet based on the principles discovered by Weston Price. At his hospital, he served liberal amounts of liver, butter, cream and eggs to convalescing patients. \n\nPottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract hormones he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments. He was feeding the cats a nutritive diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver, tripe, sweetbreads, brains, heart and muscle. \nWhen the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply. Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Their kittens were more energetic and their post-operative death rate was lower.\nAt a certain point, he decided to begin a controlled scientific study. Pottenger conducted studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years, with four generations of cats being studied. \n\nIn one study, one group of cats was fed a diet of two-thirds raw meat, one-third raw milk, and cod-liver oil while the second group was fed a diet of two-thirds cooked meat, one-third raw milk, and cod-liver oil. The cats fed the all-raw diet were healthy while the cats fed the cooked meat diet developed various health problems. \n\nAt the time of Pottenger's Study the amino acid taurine had been discovered but had not yet been identified as an essential amino acid for cats. Today many cats thrive on a cooked meat diet where taurine has been added after cooking. The deficient diets lacked sufficient taurine to allow the cats to properly form protein structures and resulted in the health effects observed. Pottenger himself concluded that there was likely an \"as yet unknown\" protein factor that may have been heat sensitive.\n\nIn another study, dubbed the \"Milk Study,\" the cats were fed 2/3 milk and 1/3 meat. All groups were fed raw meat with different groups getting raw, pasteurized, evaporated, sweetened condensed or metabolized vitamin D milk. The cats on raw milk were the healthiest while the rest exhibited varying degrees of health problems similar to the previous cooked meat study. \nThis particular Pottenger cat study has been cited by advocates of raw milk as evidence that it is likely healthier for humans than pasteurized milk.\n\n\n"}

They form the bulk of the historical colonial establishment of eastern India. Educated mostly in a select few schools and colleges, they were one of the wealthiest and most anglicised communities of colonial India. Presidency College's control over the development of and continued influence on the Brahmos and \"vice versa\" was complete in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Drawn from the ranks of the newly emerging colonial ruling class, considered to be junior partners in the enterprise of the British Empire, the Brahmos were typically employed as Bengal Presidency governors, high court judges, commissioners, collectors, magistrates, railway managers, university vice chancellors, Presidency College and Calcutta Medical College principals and professors, research think tank directors as well as those who made their major profits in big business. Politically, they were considered to be moderates in nationalist politics, with the aim of joining council politics for the furtherance of the constitutional question within the framework of the Empire. Influenced by the teachings of the Upanishads (উপনিষদ).\n\nA Brahmo () is either an adherent, with or without a \"diksha\" (দীক্ষা), of Brahmoism to the exclusion of all other sects, castes and even religions, except Hinduism, or a person with at least one Brahmo parent or guardian and who has never denied his faith. This definition has evolved from legal acts and juristic decree since previously \"the word Brahmo did not admit of a clear definition.\"\n\nThe 2001 Census of India counted only 177 Brahmos in India, but the number of followers (Brahmo Samajists) who constitute the wider community of Brahmo Samaj (assembly for Brahmo worship) is significantly higher, and reliably estimated at about 20, 000 Sadharan Brahmo Samajists, 10, 000 other Brahmo denominations and 8, 000,000 declared Adi Dharmists. Since the Brahmo Samaj does not sanction caste, many low caste Brahmo converts in Upper India, benefiting under India's social development policies, prefer to declare themselves as followers of Adi Dharm, a practice fostered by the Brahmo Samaj of North India since the 1931 census. A state-wise study by the Brahmo Conference Organisation has tabulated 7. 83 million Adi Dharm declarants in the 2001 Census.\n\nA recent publication describes the disproportionate influence of Brahmos on India's development post-19th Century as unparalleled in recent times, It states that the \"... Brahmos are amongst the elite groups of modern India, along with the Parsis of Bombay, the Chitpavans of Pune, the Iyers, Nairs and Ayyangars of the South, the Kashmiri Pandits of Uttar Pradesh and the Kayasthas of the Punjab and Bihar...\" This publication further states that the Brahmos are \"... the most cosmopolitan, having been overwhelmingly drawn from three castes – Brahmins, Vaidyas and Kayasthas – while the others were from a single caste...\" It was the Brahmos who played an important role in organizing the Indian Political Association, which was the forerunner to the Indian National Congress.\n\nThe Brahmo Samaj refers to the wider socio-religious community either following the principles for Brahmo worship or subscribing to membership of a Brahmo Samaj, which is an association established for maintaining premises for assembly and worship of Brahma. A follower or subscriber member of this community is referred to as Brahmo Samajist.\n\nOne aspect of Brahmoism is recognition that not only explicit faith and worship makes for a Brahmo, but also genealogy, which is implicit. People with even a single Brahmo parent or a Brahmo guardian are treated as Brahmos until they absolutely renounce the Brahmo faith. This often causes tension within the Samaj, for example, when an offspring of a Brahmo follows communism or atheism or another religious belief without renouncing Brahmoism formally. There are differing views between the Theist and Deist streams of Brahmoism on the retention of such people within the fold. Additionally, a Brahmo who opts not to subscribe to membership of a Brahmo Samaj remains a Brahmo but ceases to be a Brahmo Samajist.\n\nBrahmoism does not forbid its followers from retaining other faiths like Islam or Christianity. Neither is formal conversion to Brahmoism required nowadays, thereby affirming a very well settled legal controversy between Sir J.C. Bose and Rani Bhagwwan Koer which states that a non-Brahmo Brahmo Samajist does not cease to be (say) a Hindu or Sikh by following the Samaj.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen family\n\n\n\nBaron Sinha family\n\n\nTagore family\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBantayan is located on Bantayan Island, from Cebu City. According to the , it has a population of , making it the island's most populous town as well as the largest.\n\nIt is bordered to the north by the town of Madridejos, to the southwest is the Tañon Strait, to the east is the town of Medellin and to the south is the town of Santa Fe.\n\nBantayan comprises 25 barangays:\n\nGawad Kalinga has a village in brgy Mojon.\n\nFor short journeys within population centres, then trisikads are readily available. They can carry two or three adults plus goods, a total load in excess of . They are available only where land is flat and level.\n\nFor longer journeys, such as from the municipal centre to outlying barangays, then motor tricycles are available. Smaller ones are motorcycle-sidecar combinations, and can carry about 4 passengers. Larger ones, known as \"multis\", have some sort of saloon behind the driver, and are usually shared between as many as eight passengers, plus some goods stowage.\n\nFor the longest journeys, such as from Santa Fe ferry pier into downtown Bantayan and onwards, there are larger jeepneys, which can carry around 20 passengers with rooftop goods stowage.\n\nThere is no public bus service as such.\n\nThere are a few historically notable buildings but they have generally not been well maintained, and the ravages of the climate hasten decay, together with several major fires, which consume the wooden structures. Preventive maintenance generally was not practised, so even the best preserved buildings date back only to the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThe main church stands on the principal plaza. Since the arrival of the Spanish there have been several buildings on its site: originally it was little more than a bamboo and nipa structure, which was burned down during one of the Moro raids. This was replaced by another wooden structure, which also burned down. Construction of the present building (the fifth on the site) started in 1839. The main driving force was the parish priest Padre Doroteo Andrade del Rosario and the \"maestro de obras\" (master of works) was his nephew Manuel Rubio y del Rosario (also known as \"\"). Construction lasted about 24 years. The principal building material is coral, sawn to approximately parallelepiped shape and dressed like stone.\n\nSince mid–2012 refurbishment work has been in progress: the belfry has been restored to its former glory, and there are plans to open it for tourist access. The stairs are very steep and not very well guarded, however it does offer an elevated panoramic view of the waterfront.\n\nThe church also houses a small museum, visiting by appointment.\n\n it is some sort of warehouse for glass and windows.\n\nThe building was entirely demolished in early 2015 to make way for the island's first supermarket development.\n\nCentral plaza was the location of several well-built houses. Opposite the church Manuel del Rosario built two which used to be \"the grandest homes on Bantayan island\". Originally pre-dating the church, one was used as the \"Casa de Mamposteria\" (house of masons) during construction of the church. The main house was later inherited by the son of del Rosario and his second wife, while the house next door was their wedding gift to their daughter.\n\nAfter subsequent bequests, ownership of both houses was shared by many scions of the Causing and Escario families. They were unable to decide on (or maybe fund) any necessary preventive maintenance work. both houses have more or less collapsed in ruins past repair. All that remains of Bantayan's former glory is a dangerous and unsightly collection of rotten beams, collapsed walls and broken tiles occupying a prime and valuable location. Typhoon Yolanda subsequently caused both ruins to collapse entirely.\n\nThere are no longer any public entertainment centres such as cinemas. Apart from religious fiestas and processions, the main Bantayanon enjoyment comes from karaoke (known as videoke). Many households have their own equipment, but for special occasions they hire equipment with truly prodigious output, especially with low frequency sound. This is likely to be placed in the street, for the enjoyment of all the neighbourhood.\n\nMuch of the municipality coastline is unsuitable as a beach - there is no real sandy area, mostly rocks or mud, all along the southern coast of the municipality, and the western coast almost as far north as Baod and Patao. There are better beaches on the eastern coast, but access is difficult.\n\nSillon and Baigad is where good beaches can be found – wide expanses of sand, clean sea and few bathers. However these too have plenty of detritus and flotsam – for the most part seaweed and vegetation from the coconut palms which line the shore. The beaches are almost completely undeveloped, so no facilities, and there are several large private properties which are built close to the shore line.\nPrivate facilities which are open to the public include:\n\nAs is common throughout the Philippines, 'sport' is synonymous with cock-fighting.

The street dancing and ritual showdown competitions which depict the fishing traditions of Bantayan have contributed to Palawod's being the 3-times Grand Champion of the \"Pasigarbo sa Sugbo\" Festival of Festivals.\n\nSinulog takes place at the end of January, when there are ten or more days of noisy celebration.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was named after Ioannis Metaxas, then Prime Minister of Greece, and chiefly consists of tunnels that led to observatories, emplacements and machine-gun nests. The constructions are so sturdy that they survive to this day, some of which are still in active service. Some of them are open to the public.\nThe Metaxas Line consists of 21 independent fortification complexes, the largest of which is Fort Roupel as it covers 6.1 out of the 155 km of the full line and had been constructed at a height of 322 m. Illumination was initially mostly provided by oil-lamps, although generators were also installed t. Currently, the fortifications are supplied with public electricity, but they are also equipped with generators. Ventilation was achieved both naturally and artificially. Water was supplied via water-mains. The fortification works lasted four years and their cost at the time reached 100,400,000 drachmas.\n\nThe following 21 forts make up the Metaxas Line, ordered from West to East along the Greco-Bulgarian border. \n\nBefore the outbreak of World War II, the additions made to the Roupel Fortress were considered to be too weak. Thus, it was decided that further fortifications should be constructed, not only in that particular region, but also along the entire northern Greek borderline. The plans were drawn up in 1935 and work began at Kerkini in 1936. The original intention was that the full fortifications' line reach as far along the border as Ormenion. Greece, however, became involved in World War II in 1940, thus preventing completion. At the war's outbreak, the fortification line had only reached Komotini, Thrace and was 155 km long.\n\nLike the Maginot Line on the Franco-German border, the Metaxas Line was outflanked by German forces specifically when the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941 through Yugoslavia. The German XVIII Mountain Corps and XXX Army Corps attacked the Metaxas Line before dawn on 6 April, but they encountered fierce resistance under the leadership of Brig. General Konstantinos Th. Bakopoulos, and after three days of fighting they had only limited successes. \nThe 2nd Panzerdivision XVIII Mountain Corps with an enveloping move crossed the Yugoslavian borders, overcame Yugoslav and Greek resistance and captured Thessaloniki on the 9th of April. The capture of Thessaloniki forced the Greek East Macedonia Army Section to surrender on the 10th of April and the Metaxas Line battle was over.\n\nGerman General Wilhelm List, who led the attack against the Metaxas Line, admired the bravery and courage of these soldiers. He refrained from taking the Greek soldiers prisoner and declared that the army was free to leave with their war flags, on condition that they surrender their arms and supplies. He also ordered his soldiers and officers to salute the Greek soldiers (Beevor 2005, p. 20). The line was also poorly manned as most of the Greek Army was fighting against the Italians, on the Albanian front.\n\n\n"}

The benefit to the municipality is that they get a portion of the taxes levied in the JEDD without having to annex it. The benefits to the township are that it does not lose prime development land, it can still collect property taxes as well as a portion of the income tax collected, and it normally receives water from the municipality, which it may not otherwise have. In 1993, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation enabling local communities to create JEDDs.\n\nJEDDs began in Summit County. Akron had been annexing parts of neighboring townships. This made for bad relations with the townships and hurt them economically. Mayor Don Plusquellic championed the idea of the JEDD as a way to expand the city's tax base without having to fight with its neighbors. This required new legislation from the state. Initially only Summit County was allowed to have JEDDs but later on the idea was expanded to the rest of the state. Akron quickly formed JEDDs with Springfield, Coventry, and Copley townships. Later on, in conjunction with Fairlawn it formed a JEDD with Bath Township. Since then other communities in Summit County and the rest of the state have formed JEDDs.\n\nTo create a JEDD, the municipality and township work together to create a contract. This contract specifies details such as how taxes are levied and shared, annexation prohibitions, and water rates. The communities then vote on the agreement. The issue must pass in each community for the JEDD to be approved.\n\nIn 2006, a JEDD was established between the City of Columbus (Franklin County, Ohio) and three jurisdictions in Pickaway County.

The title of the film is that of the first volume of Churchill's largely autobiographical six-volume history of the war, which covered the period from 1919 to 3 September 1939, the day he became First Lord of the Admiralty.\n\nThe film, directed by Richard Loncraine and written by Larry Ramin and Hugh Whitemore, stars Albert Finney as Churchill and Vanessa Redgrave as his wife Clementine Churchill (\"Clemmie\"). The film also features a supporting cast of British actors such as Derek Jacobi, Ronnie Barker (his first role since retiring in 1988), Jim Broadbent, Tom Wilkinson, Celia Imrie, Linus Roache and Hugh Bonneville, and is notable for an early appearance by a young Tom Hiddleston. Lena Headey, Simon Williams, and Edward Hardwicke all make brief appearances amongst the supporting cast. Among the film's executive producers were Ridley Scott and Tony Scott. Originally the film was named \"The Lonely War\".\n\nFinney gained many accolades for his performance, winning both a BAFTA Award for Best Actor and an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor. Ramin and Whitemore won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing. It won a Peabody Award in 2002 for being \"a portrait of a 20th Century hero’s return from political obscurity to direct the destiny of a nation.\" In 2016, Mark Lawson of \"The Guardian\" ranked it as the most memorable television portrayal of Churchill. A sequel, \"Into the Storm\", was released in 2009, with Churchill portrayed by Brendan Gleeson, which focuses on the prime minister's days in office during World War II.\n\nIn 1934, Winston Churchill is deep in his wilderness years, and struggling to complete his biography of his ancestor the Duke of Marlborough, which he hopes will revive his fortunes. Winston is chided by his wife Clemmie for their lack of money and is aware that as a 'man of destiny' his moment may have passed. At the same time he struggles in the House of Commons as a backbencher to get a hearing for his concerns about German re-armament under Hitler and the policy of appeasement.\n\nChurchill is also disappointed by the behaviour of his son Randolph Churchill (Tom Hiddleston), which leads to further arguments with Clemmie, who announces she is leaving to go on an extended overseas trip. Churchill is devastated and throws himself into his pet activities: painting, and building walls around the family house. Clemmie eventually returns, and the couple are reconciled.\n\nA young official in the government, Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) has become concerned about the growth of the German Luftwaffe (air force), and is convinced by his wife to leak information about it to Churchill.\n\nShortly afterwards, Churchill uses Wigram's information to launch an attack on the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). In 1936, Wigram commits suicide.\n\nWith Churchill's fortunes restored, the narrative jumps forward to September 1939, with the declaration of war against Germany at the start of World War II, and the announcement that Churchill will be taking over command of the Royal Navy again as First Lord of the Admiralty. An impatient Churchill bids farewell to the staff at the country house, and travels to London. Arriving in the middle of the night at the Admiralty, Churchill is met by a Royal Marine corporal who informs him the fleet have already been signalled that \"\"Winston is Back\"\", to which Churchill triumphantly replies, \"\"And so he bloody well is!\"\"\n\nChartwell House was Churchill's real-life family home and was used for the scenes at his house and grounds.\n\nIn 2016, Mark Lawson of \"The Guardian\" chose \"The Gathering Storm\" as the most memorable television portrayal of Churchill. He wrote: \"This BBC-HBO account of Churchill's return from exile to save his nation will always be the one to beat. Finney doesn’t take many roles, and his meticulous preparation is apparent: he uncannily walks and talks almost exactly as Churchill did, while also vividly suggesting - especially in a scene where the leader, nude in his bathroom, dictates a speech to a secretary - the character’s battles between body and mind.\"\n\n\n"}

It resulted in the deposing of Eric and the erosion of the union.\n\nIn 1434, Sweden was part of the Kalmar Union, a personal union that united Sweden with Denmark and Norway under a single monarch, the current monarch being Eric of Pomerania. The Swedes were not happy with the Danes' frequent warfare on Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania, which disturbed Swedish exports (notably iron) to the Continent. During the Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic war, while the exports were brought to a halt, the collection of taxes continued, enraging Swedish peasants. Furthermore, the centralization of government in Denmark raised suspicions. The Swedish Privy Council wanted to retain a fair degree of self-government.\n\nThe rebellion was ignited by the tax situation, where Eric showed arrogance by not negotiating with the four Estates of the Swedish realm at a Diet.\n\nIn the summer of 1434, enraged miners and peasants burned the castle of Borganäs near Borlänge. The tension spread, causing several assaults on castles across the country. Nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson with mining interests in the Bergslagen area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army. Negotiations with Eric took place in Vadstena in August 1434, but were unsuccessful.\n\nIn January 1435 Engelbrekt summoned representatives from the four Estates to a Diet in Arboga, which later has been called the first Riksdag of the Estates (although it is uncertain whether the peasants really participated). Engelbrekt was elected Captain (\"Rikshövitsman\") of the Swedish realm. The antagonism abated when Eric promised changes for the better. However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm, where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city.\n\nA certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the Nobility and Clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 had risen to the position of \"Rikshövitsman\". Neither dared remove Engelbrekt completely because of his strong support among the two lower Estates (Burghers and Peasants). However, Engelbrekt fell sick and became less active. In a twist of fate highly beneficial to Knutsson, Engelbrekt was assassinated on May 4 by Måns Bengtsson (Natt och Dag), the cause being an unrelated personal conflict. Consequently, Knutsson won the power struggle (and became King Charles VIII of Sweden in 1448). A man named Erik Puke attempted to rally Engelbrekt's old supporters in the \"Pukefejden\", but it was too late. Puke was apprehended and executed in Stockholm in 1437.\n\nThe Engelbrekt rebellion caused the unity of the Kalmar Union to erode, leading to the expulsion of Danish forces from Sweden. Although later Danish kings regained influence over Sweden, the rebellion had set a precedent for Swedish claims to sovereignty. It also set a precedent for peasants to engage actively in Swedish politics; in the future power claimants always took pains to appeal to peasant and peasant interests.\n\nFurthermore, where it is uncertain whether all four Estates participated in the Diet (\"Riksdag\") in Arboga, this was in fact the case in 1436, when a Diet was held in Uppsala following the death of Engelbrekt. Thus, the Engelbrekt rebellion marked the start of a democratic institution, which, to a certain extent, included the peasants.\n"}

This was re-expressed, with the advent of sheaf theory, in a way that made an analogy with Poincaré duality more apparent. Then according to a general principle, Grothendieck's relative point of view, the theory of Jean-Pierre Serre was extended to a proper morphism; Serre duality was recovered as the case of the morphism of a non-singular projective variety (or complete variety) to a point. The resulting theory is now sometimes called Serre–Grothendieck–Verdier duality, and is a basic tool in algebraic geometry. A treatment of this theory, \"Residues and Duality\" (1966) by Robin Hartshorne, became a reference. One concrete spin-off was the Grothendieck residue.\n\nTo go beyond proper morphisms, as for the versions of Poincaré duality that are not for closed manifolds, requires some version of the \"compact support\" concept. This was addressed in SGA2 in terms of local cohomology, and Grothendieck local duality; and subsequently. The Greenlees–May duality, first formulated in 1976 by Ralf Strebel and in 1978 by Eben Matlis, is part of the continuing consideration of this area.\n\nWhile Serre duality uses a line bundle or invertible sheaf as a dualizing sheaf, the general theory (it turns out) cannot be quite so simple. (More precisely, it can, but at the cost of the Gorenstein ring condition.) In a characteristic turn, Grothendieck reformulated general coherent duality as the existence of a right adjoint functor \"f\", called \"twisted\" or \"exceptional inverse image functor\", to a higher direct image with compact support functor \"Rf\".\n\n\"Higher direct images\" are a sheafified form of sheaf cohomology in this case with proper (compact) support; they are bundled up into a single functor by means of the derived category formulation of homological algebra (introduced with this case in mind). In case f is proper \"Rf\" = \"Rf\" is itself a right adjoint, to the \"inverse image\" functor \"f\". The \"existence theorem\" for the twisted inverse image is the name given to the proof of the existence for what would be the counit for the comonad of the sought-for adjunction, namely a natural transformation\n\nwhich is denoted by \"Tr\" (Hartshorne) or \"∫\" (Verdier). It is the aspect of the theory closest to the classical meaning, as the notation suggests, that duality is defined by integration.\n\nTo be more precise, \"f\" exists as an exact functor from a derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on \"Y\", to the analogous category on \"X\", whenever\n\nis a proper or quasi projective morphism of noetherian schemes, of finite Krull dimension. From this the rest of the theory can be derived: dualizing complexes pull back via \"f\", the Grothendieck residue symbol, the dualizing sheaf in the Cohen–Macaulay case.\n\nIn order to get a statement in more classical language, but still wider than Serre duality, Hartshorne (\"Algebraic Geometry\") uses the Ext functor of sheaves; this is a kind of stepping stone to the derived category.\n\nThe classical statement of Grothendieck duality for a projective or proper morphism formula_1 of noetherian schemes of finite dimension, found in Hartshorne (\"Residues and duality\") is the following quasi-isomorphism\n\nfor \"F\" a bounded above complex of \"O\"-modules with quasi-coherent cohomology and \"G\" a bounded below complex of \"O\"-modules with coherent cohomology. Here the \"Hom\"'s are the sheaf of homomorphisms.\n\nOver the years, several approaches for constructing the formula_3 pseudofunctor emerged. One quite recent successful approach is based on the notion of a rigid dualizing complex. This notion was first defined by Van den Bergh in a noncommutative context. The construction is based on a variant of derived Hochschild cohomology (Shukla cohomology): Let \"k\" be a commutative ring, and let \"A\" be a commutative \"k-\"algebra. There is a functor formula_5 which takes a cochain complex \"M\" to an object formula_5 in the derived category over \"A\".\n\nAsumming \"A\" is noetherian, a rigid dualizing complex over \"A\" relative to \"k\" is by definition a pair formula_7 where \"R\" is a dualizing complex over \"A\" which has finite flat dimension over \"k\", and where\nformula_8 is an isomorphism in the derived category \"D(A)\". If such a rigid dualizing complex exists, then it is unique in a strong sense.\n\nAssuming \"A\" is a localization of a finite type \"k\"-algebra, existence of a rigid dualizing complex over \"A\" relative to \"k\" was first proved by Yekutieli and Zhang assuming \"k\" is a regular noetherian ring of finite Krull dimension, and by Avramov, Iyengar and Lipman assuming \"k\" is a Gorenstein ring of finite Krull dimension and \"A\" is of finite flat dimension over \"A\".\n\nIf \"X\" is a scheme of finite type over \"k\", one can glue the rigid dualizing complexes that its affine pieces have, and obtain a rigid dualizing complex formula_9. Once one establishes a global existence of a rigid dualizing complex, given a map formula_10 of schemes over \"k\", one can define formula_11, where for a scheme \"X\", we set formula_12.\n\nThe dualizing complex for a projective variety formula_13 is given by the complex\nConsider the projective variety\nWe can compute formula_16 using a resolution formula_17 by locally free sheaves. This is given by the complex\nSince formula_19 we have that\nThis is the complex\n\n\n"}

In Nainital and Almora, thousands take part in the procession carrying the dola (or litter) of Nanda Devi. It is said that the Nanda Devi fairs started in Kumaon during the reign of the King Kalyan Chand in the 16th century. A three-day fair is held at Kot Ki Mai or Kot Bhramari Devi. The fair at Saneti comes every second year. Both these fairs are rich in folk expressions, and many village products are brought for sale.\n\nDue to the heavy rain and cloudburst in June 2013 in Uttarakhand, which led to major loss of life and property and caused massive destruction to the region, the Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra from 29 scheduled to take place in August 2013 was postponed to the year 2014.\n\nThis Raj jat yatra originates from Nauti village 25 km from Karnprayag, in Karnprayag tahsil of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The Kunwar of village Kansua inaugurates the ceremony, however the main priest of Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra remains the Nautiyals originated from Nauti Village, near to Kansua. The legend of this yatra is Nanda Devi, who is consort of Lord Shiva left her village and went to the Nanda Devi parbat. Therefore, when the yatra starts, heavy rain occurs as if the devi is crying. This yatra covers many villages and in the way, the Devi meets her sister in the Bhagwati village.\n\nThis journey is a difficult one because of the difficult terrain it goes through. During the journey, one passes by a Lake known as Roopkund surrounded by hundreds of ancient skeletons. According to local mythology, once a King took some dancers to this sacred spot. Due to heavy snowfall, the people were trapped and the dancers were transformed into skeletons and stones that can be seen in Patarnachonia. Another myth is this that king Yasodhwal's wife was pregnant and while she was giving birth to her child, her placenta flowed down to Roopkund and this in turn caused the death of the people there.\n\nDuring the period of Chand kings, Nanda Devi worship took the shape of a fair. Prior to that, Nanda Devi was being worshipped, but at that time only an idol of Nanda Devi used to be worshipped. The custom to make two idols started from the period of Baj Bahadur Chand. Even today, only one idol is prepared in the remote villages. The reason for this addition appears to be because the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda together took birth as princesses in the royal family and to mark this new reincarnation, the practice of celebrating a festival for both sisters together was introduced in which a story from their life is enacted.\n\nThe twin peaks of the Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi Mountain are said to be the abode or represent the two goddesses. These graceful peaks are visible from most of Kumaon division of Uttarakhand province of India.\n\nThe Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra 2014 started from 18 August 2014 and went up to 6 September 2014. The Yatra's total distance covered approximately 290 km. The 230 km distance was covered by foot or by trekking route and the rest 60 km was covered by the bus transport. Before the present Yatra of Nanda Raj Jat Yatra, the trip was held in the year 2000, and it is one of the biggest trips of Uttarakhand. The Main things of Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra is the distance covered on foot. So it is considered a very holy Trip. Many Tourists from various parts of India and from abroad have come to join the holy Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra.\n\n\n\n3. \"Nanda Devi Raj Jat\", Nanada Devi Sandarbh Patrika, 1988, Pub: Nanda Devi Mandir Evam Mela Samiti, Almora Article by: Kaushal Kishore Saxena\n4.

Below 900 MHz the target radar cross section increases exponentially, however the increased radar cross section means that there is much more radar return from undesirable sources, such as cloud cover and rain (\"cf.\" weather radar). It is because of this that radars are traditionally at much higher frequency, with an exception being the radars operated in the 3-30 MHz band which are used as over-the-horizon radar stations because signals in that range are able to reflect off the ionosphere.\n\nRecent interest has accumulated in developing radars which operate in these low frequencies to help counter the advancement in stealth technology by applying advanced digital signal processing to these bands in order to reduce radar clutter. If the radar wavelength is roughly twice the size of the target, a half-wave resonance effect can still generate a significant return. However, low-frequency radar is limited by shortage of unused frequencies, lack of accuracy given the long wavelength, and by the radar's size, making it difficult to transport and making for an easy target. A long-wave radar may detect a target and roughly locate it, but not identify it, and the location information lacks sufficient weapon targeting accuracy\n"}

The first Coney Island restaurant was opened in Jackson, Michigan in 1914 by a Macedonian immigrant named George Todoroff. Today two unaffiliated Coney Island restaurants, Jackson Coney Island and Virginia Coney Island, are located in a building near the train station on East Michigan Avenue near the site of his original restaurant. In addition, several local restaurants throughout the Jackson area offer their own version of the Coney Island hot dog, or just \"coney\" as referred to by local residents.\n\nTwo of the best-known Coney Island restaurants are the Lafayette Coney Island and the American Coney Island, which are located in adjacent buildings on Lafayette Boulevard in downtown Detroit. They have a common root, with the original restaurant having been established by Greek immigrant brothers Bill and Gus Keros in 1915. The brothers got into a business dispute soon thereafter, and in 1917 split their restaurant into the two establishments that exist today.\n\nMany European immigrants of the early twentieth century entered the United States through Ellis island. One of their first stops was often the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, along the South Shore beachfront, where hot dogs were very popular. The original restaurant name referred to the restaurant being an immigrant-owned establishment, serving Coney Island's food of choice.\n\nThe menu of all Coney Island restaurants centers on the Coney Island hot dog, which is a natural-casing hot dog in a steamed bun dressed with chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard. This item is usually referred to simply as a \"coney.\" Another popular item on most Coney Island restaurant menus is the \"loose hamburger,\" which consists of crumbled ground beef in a hot dog bun, covered in the same condiments as a Coney Island hot dog. Many Coney Islands also serve \"chili fries,\" which are french fries covered in chili, sometimes with mustard, onions and/or cheese added.\n\nMany Coney Islands offer other Greek and Greek-American dishes, such as gyros, souvlaki, shish kebab, spanakopita, saganaki, and Greek salads, as well as usual American diner fare, such as regular hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, and desserts.\n\nSince the owners of the first Coney Island restaurants did not trademark the name or business plan, many other restaurants began using the same name and formula. Coney Islands were opened throughout the city by Greek immigrants.\nConey Islands have developed a distinctive dining style that is repeated in hundreds of different restaurants throughout the metropolitan Detroit area and elsewhere in Michigan and other nearby states. There are some regional variations though, such as the chili sauce, which is more liquid in Detroit area Coney Island restaurants compared to the drier sauce served in Coney Island restaurants in the nearby Jackson, Michigan and Flint, Michigan areas.\n\nMany Greek diners in Buffalo, New York and throughout upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania (particularly Wilkes-Barre) and New Jersey are similar in format to Detroit-style Coney Islands, even serving their own style of dogs, called a Texas Hot or Texas Wiener. Unlike the Coney Island restaurants in Detroit, though, the Texas Hot is often not the dominant menu item in these establishments.\n\nSioux City, Iowa also has a handful of Coney Island eateries, as does the Houston, Texas, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Tulsa, Oklahoma area.\n\nJames Coney Island, Inc. is a chain of fast food restaurants that specializes in Coney Island hot dogs. It has its headquarters, the James Coney Island Support Center, located in Suite 700 in the 11111 Katy Freeway building in Houston.\n\nThe Leo's Coney Island chain was created by Greek brothers Peter and Leo Stassinopoulos. The brothers are nephews to Bill and Gust Keros who founded American and Lafayette Coney Islands. Peter and Leo worked at local Coney Island restaurants until they opened their own Coney Island in 1972 called the Southfield Souvlaki Coney Island in Southfield, Michigan. One location opened in 1978 in Michigan and another in 1982 in Farmington Hills. In 1988, the name Leo's Coney Island was given to its newest location in Troy, Michigan. From then on, the chain took on the name Leo's Coney Island. The brothers began franchising in 2005 and are now the largest Coney Island chain in world. \n\nLeo's uses buns from the Metropolitan Baking Company and the coney sauce is their own recipe manufactured by The Milton Chili Company located in Madison Heights. The natural casing hot dogs are supplied by the Koegel Meat Company.\n\nNational Coney Island is a Coney Island-style restaurant based in Michigan that specializes in Greek-American cuisine. It is a corporation that has more than 20 National Coney Island locations in the Metro Detroit area.\n\nDetroit's American Coney Island and Lafayette Coney Island have both been featured on episodes of Travel Channel shows \"Man v. Food\" and \"Food Wars\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1815258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815258", "title": "Rindr", "text": "Rindr\n\nRindr (Old Norse) or Rinda (Latin) (sometimes Anglicized Rind) is a female goddess in Norse mythology, alternatively described as a giantess or a human princess from the east. She was impregnated by Odin and gave birth to the avenger of Baldr's death—in the Old Norse sources, Váli.\n\nSnorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\" refers to Rindr as the mother of Váli and one of the ásynjur (goddesses). The most detailed account is in Book III of the \"Gesta Danorum\", written by Saxo Grammaticus around the early 13th century. There she is called Rinda and is the daughter of the King of the Ruthenians. After Balderus' death Odin consulted seers on how to get revenge. On their advice Odin went to the Ruthenians disguised as a warrior called Roster. There he was twice turned down by Rinda. He then wrote runes on a piece of bark and touched her with it, causing her to go mad, and disguised himself as a medicine woman called Wecha, who was allowed to see her. Finally she fell ill; the disguised Odin then said he had medicine with which to cure her but that it would cause a violent reaction. On Odin's advice, the king tied Rinda to her bed, and Odin proceeded to rape her. From the rape was born Váli, who would later avenge Balderus.\n\nÓðinn’s rape of Rindr is described once outside the \"Gesta Danorum\", in a line of stanza 3 of \"Sigurðardrápa\", a poem by Kormákr Ögmundarson praising Sigurðr Hlaðajarl, who ruled around Trondheim in the mid-10th century. Like other such praise-poems, it is generally assumed to be genuine rather than a later pseudo-historical composition. Kormákr’s verse contains the statement, \"seið Yggr til Rindar\" (Yggr [Óðinn] ?enchanted Rindr), denoting Óðinn’s magical rape of Rindr with the verb \"síða\". This suggests that Kormakr thought the magic known as \"seiðr\" was integral to Óðinn’s raping of Rindr, and is important evidence for Óðinn's association with this kind of magic. Another passage that may refer to the same event is in verse 6 of the Eddic poem \"Grógaldr\": \"þann gól Rindi Rani\" (that [charm] Rani chanted to Rindr).\n\nRindr's name occurs in several skaldic verses and in \"Baldrs draumar\", where alliteration suggests it may originally have been *\"Vrindr\"; the etymology remains uncertain but there may be a connection with the Swedish placename Vrinnevi or Vrinnevid, near Norrköping.\n"}

He then became highly regarded as an award-winning Shakespearean and West End theatre actor and television sitcom star. winning the 1977 Evening Standard Award for Best Actor for \"King Lear\", and starring in the sitcoms \"Two's Company\" (1975–79) and \"Never the Twain\" (1981–91).\n\nSinden made his first stage appearance at the amateur Brighton Little Theatre (of which he later became president) in 1941, stepping into a part in place of his cousin Frank, who had been called up to war and so was unable to appear. Offered a professional acting part by the Brighton impresario Charles F. Smith, he made his first professional appearance in January 1942, playing Dudley in a production of \"George and Margaret\" for the Mobile Entertainments Southern Area company (known as MESA) and in other modern comedies, playing to the armed forces all along the South Coast of England during the Second World War and later trained as an actor for two terms at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nIn 1942, in Hove, Sinden befriended Lord Alfred Douglas (known as \"Bosie\"), who had been Oscar Wilde's lover. On 23 March 1945, he was one of only two persons who attended his funeral. He is believed to have been the last surviving person to have known Douglas.\n\nAfter the critical and financial success of his first screen leading role in \"The Cruel Sea\" (1953), made by Ealing Studios, in which he co-starred and received top-billing with Jack Hawkins, Sinden was contracted for seven years to the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios and subsequently had prominent roles in 23 movies during the 1950s and early 1960s, including \"Mogambo\"; \"Doctor in the House\"; \"Above Us the Waves\"; \"The Black Tent\"; \"Eyewitness\"; \"Doctor at Large\"; \"The Siege of Sidney Street\" and \"Twice Round the Daffodils\".\n\nSinden became associated with his character of \"Benskin\" in the \"Doctor\" film series as the duffel-coated medical student, regularly failing his finals and spending most of his time chasing pretty nurses, accompanied by his trade-mark \"wolf-growl\".\n\nSinden was the recipient of several \"audience-based\" awards during this period, including \"The actor who made most progress during 1954\". In 1956, a profile was written on him which stated:\n\nIn 1949, he appeared in \"The Heiress\" at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket opposite Ralph Richardson and Peggy Ashcroft, directed by John Gielgud. In his Sky Arts documentary series \"Great West End Theatres\", Sinden said that the play ran for 644 performances (19 months) and he was the only member of the cast not to have missed a performance: \"As the play is the longest run in the [Haymarket] theatre's history, I therefore gave more consecutive performances in this theatre than any other actor since it was built in 1820.\" The management gave him an engraved silver ashtray as a present in recognition of the fact, which he showed in the episode.\n\nTheatre being his first \"love\", he was a noted farceur and won best actor awards for his appearances in the Ray Cooney farces \"Not Now, Darling\" (1967); \"Two into One\" (1984) and \"Out of Order\" (1990). In 1976 he was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Actor for his performance on Broadway as Arthur Wicksteed in Alan Bennett's comedy \"Habeas Corpus\". His other notable leading performances in the commercial theatre included roles in productions such as \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" (1966); \"In Praise of Love\" (1973); \"An Enemy of the People\" (1975); \"Present Laughter\" (1981); \"The School for Scandal\" (1983); \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1985); \"Major Barbara\" (1988); \"Diversions and Delights\" (one-man show as Oscar Wilde, 1989); \"That Good Night\" (1996) and \"Quartet\" (1999).\n\nSinden was a leading figure in the fight to launch the Theatre Museum in London's Covent Garden in the 1980s. In 2007, Sinden embarked on a UK, European and American theatre tour to talk about his life, work and anecdotes in \"An Evening with... Sir Donald Sinden\". Produced by his son Marc, this included, on 8 November 2007 as part of Marc's \"British Theatre Season, Monaco\", a performance in front of Prince Albert of Monaco (the son of Grace Kelly, his co-star in the film \"Mogambo\") at the Théâtre Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo.\n\nJoining the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre company in 1946, Sinden was an Associate Artist of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) from 1967. Outstanding among his many notable stage appearances for the RSC, both at Stratford-upon-Avon and in London's West End (usually at the Aldwych Theatre), was his performance in 1963 as the Duke of York in \"The Wars of the Roses\" opposite Peggy Ashcroft as Queen Margaret.\n\nOther notable performances by Sinden for the company were \"Eh?\" by Henry Livings in 1964; as Lord Foppington in \"The Relapse\" in 1967; Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\" (opposite Judi Dench as Viola) in 1969 and again with Judi Dench and her husband Michael Williams in 1974, as Sir Harcourt Courtly in \"London Assurance\" (Albery Theatre).\n\nAfter the production transferred to New York in 1975, Sinden became the first recipient of the newly established Broadway Drama Desk Special Award. Sinden sought and received advice about the character's costume and mannerisms in the role from the Regency novelist Georgette Heyer.\n\nFor the 1976 Stratford season and then at the Aldwych Theatre in 1977, Sinden won the Evening Standard Award as Best Actor for his performance in the title role of \"King Lear\" (with Michael Williams as the Fool). Meanwhile, he was also portraying in repertory, Benedick (regarded as \"the most admired Benedick in living memory\") opposite Judi Dench's Beatrice in John Barton's highly acclaimed 'British Raj' revival of \"Much Ado About Nothing\", and in the same time frame also rehearsing the third season of the LWT sitcom \"Two's Company\" with Elaine Stritch during the daytime and filming the show at the studio in front of a live audience on Sunday evenings. He claimed \"RSC money isn't very good compared with a normal commercial theatre rate. I was on their 'star' salary, which meant it worked out at about £47 per performance! You work for them 'for the honour' of doing the greatest classical plays, not for the money, so you have to make up the financial short-fall somewhere\".\n\nIn 1979 he played the title role in \"Othello\", directed by Ronald Eyre, becoming the last 'blacked-up white' actor to play the role for the RSC. \"Everyman\" editor and critic Gareth Lloyd Evans noted that his interpretation was \"not…about colour or racialism\" but one that illuminated the character's personal tragedy.\n\nIn 2013 Sinden presented a documentary series called \"Great West End Theatres\", which describes the history and stories associated with each of 40 London theatres. Directed and produced by his son Marc, it was to be released as a 40-part DVD and Sky Arts TV series, with the first 10 episodes showing on Sky Arts 2 during the autumn of 2013.\n\nIn their review of the series, the \"British Theatre Guide\" said \"Sir Donald's gorgeous plummy tones are a joy to listen to whatever he is saying but when he is extolling the virtues of one of his own favourite theatres, the pleasure is heightened. At his first entrance, he announces that he is \"tingling with excitement\" which is just what one wants from a tour guide. Soon enough, so are viewers.\"\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\"s review states \"\"Great West End Theatres\" is a lovely documentary series, made by the director Marc Sinden. Its star, and – it transpires – the best documentary frontman of all time, is his actor-father: Sir Donald Sinden, 90 years old next month. Sir Donald has been let loose and the effect is enchanting beyond belief. It is also, at times, incredibly funny. One has the sense of a lifetime spent in this world, being poured out for our delight like glasses of vintage champagne.\"\n\nSinden achieved wide fame with the television-viewing public in 1963 through the Associated Rediffusion series \"Our Man at St Mark's\". His other featured television roles included guest-starring as the Colonel in an episode of \"The Prisoner\" (\"Many Happy Returns\", 1967).\n\nAfter starring in the series \"The Organisation\" (1971), he co-starred in the London Weekend Television situation comedy \"Two's Company\" which debuted in 1975. Sinden was cast in the role of an English butler, Robert, to Elaine Stritch's American character, Dorothy. Much of the humour derived from the culture clashes between Robert's very stiff-upper-lip Britishness and Dorothy's devil-may-care New York view on life. \"Two's Company\" was well received in Britain and ran for four seasons until 1979. The programme was nominated for a 'Best Situation Comedy' BAFTA in 1977. Stritch and Sinden also sang the theme tune for the opening credits to the programme, which received a BAFTA nomination. They each received a BAFTA nomination in 1979 for 'Best Light Entertainment Performance' and the show received two additional BAFTA nominations that year.\n\nIn 1979 Sinden presented a documentary series on BBC2 (later repeated in 1981 on BBC1), \"Discovering English Churches\" inspired by his grandfather's architectural drawings and watercolours. Over 10 episodes Sinden explored the unique history of the English church, and the influences that shaped the development of 16,000 churches, showing the history of 2–3 churches in each episode.\nFrom 1981, Sinden starred in the Thames Television situation comedy, \"Never the Twain\". He played snooty antiques dealer Simon Peel who lived next door to a competitor Oliver Smallbridge (played by Windsor Davies). The characters hated each other and were horrified when they discovered that their son and daughter were to be married – thus meaning they were related. Despite a lack of critical acclaim, the series was a TV ratings success and ran for 11 series until 1991. One episode in 1990 (\"A Car by Any Other Name\") had Sinden being literally picked up by two police officers who were played by his own actor sons, Jeremy and Marc. His wife, Diana, appeared in the last episode.\n\nHe was the subject of an extended edition of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1985 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. He also appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank.\n\nSinden was regularly spoofed on \"Spitting Image\", the 1980s British satirical television programme in which famous people were lampooned by caricatured latex puppets. Much of the \"Spitting Image\" humour was centred around Sinden being a ″ham″ actor, forever overacting and behaving in an overly theatrical way. For example, when his puppet, sitting in a restaurant, summons a waiter and asks \"Do you serve a ham salad?\" the waiter replies \"Yes, we serve salad to anyone\". Another running theme was Sinden's inability to understand why he had never received a Knighthood from the Queen and his frustration at not being able to be addressed as ″Sir Donald Sinden″. From 2001 to 2007 he played the part of senior judge (and father-in-law of the title character), Sir Joseph Channing in \"Judge John Deed\" and was the voice of \"Totally Viral\". In 2008, he played Colonel Henry Hammond in the \"Midsomer Murders\" episode \"Shot at Dawn\".\n\nHe starred in the Walt Disney Productions family film \"The Island at the Top of the World\" (1974), playing Sir Anthony Ross, which was filmed at Disney's studios in Burbank, California.\n\nSinden's distinctive voice was heard frequently on radio, including as Sir Charles Baskerville in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\". He starred in multiple adaptations of John Dickson Carr's \"Dr. Gideon Fell\" mysteries, including \"The House on Gallows Lane\", \"The Hollow Man\" and \"Black Spectacles\", \"To Wake the Dead\", \"The Blind Barber\" and \"The Mad Hatter Mystery\".\n\nSinden wrote two autobiographical volumes: \"A Touch of the Memoirs\" (1982) and \"Laughter in the Second Act\" (1985), edited the \"Everyman Book of Theatrical Anecdotes\" (1987), wrote a book to coincide with his BBC TV series \"The English Country Church\" (1988) and a collection of \"epitaphs and final utterances\" titled \"The Last Word\" (1994).\n\nSinden was awarded the CBE in 1979 and was knighted in 1997. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1966 and received the Freedom of the City of London in 1997.\n\nOn 12 July 2005, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Leicester and, on 20 July 2011, an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the University of Kent.\n\nIn reply to a question from an audience member during a performance at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre of \"An Evening with... Sir Donald Sinden\", he said he had worked out that, apart from \"gaps before the next job started\", he had only had a total of five weeks' unemployment between 1942 and 2008.\n\nIn 2004, the purpose-built theatre located in the grounds of Homewood School at Tenterden in Kent was named the Sinden Theatre.\n\nSinden was Honorary President of the Garden Suburb Theatre, an amateur theatre group based in Hampstead Garden Suburb where he was resident from 1954 until 1997.\n\nOn 9 October 2012, he celebrated his 89th birthday and his retirement after 30 years as the longest-standing President of the Royal Theatrical Fund (founded by Charles Dickens in 1839) with a celebration lunch for 350 guests at the Park Lane Hotel, London; this was compered by Russ Abbott, and the subsequent charity auction was conducted by Jeffrey Archer. Leading the tributes was Jean Kent, who had co-starred with Sinden in Bernard Delfont's 1951 stage production of \"Froufrou\"; letters from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Albert of Monaco were read out, and speeches given by Julian Fellowes, Ray Cooney and Gyles Brandreth.\n\nSinden received, posthumously, the Gielgud Award for Excellence in the Dramatic Arts at the Guildhall, London during the 2014 Theatre Awards UK ceremony, held on 19 October. The award was collected on his behalf by his son Marc Sinden.\n\nSinden was born in St Budeaux, Plymouth, Devon on 9 October 1923. The middle child of Alfred Edward Sinden and his wife Mabel Agnes (\"née\" Fuller), he had an elder sister Joy who was an English teacher at Claverham Community College in Battle, East Sussex, and a younger brother Leon (1927–2015), likewise an actor. They grew up in Ditchling, where their home 'The Limes' doubled as the local chemist's shop.\n\nAccording to his second autobiography, while investigating his family genealogy he discovered that the only previous relatives who were also members of the theatrical profession were the Victorian brother and sister act of Bert and Topsy Sinden, who were distant cousins. Topsy achieved \"some fame as a 'skirt dancer' and première danseuse at the Empire Theatre of Varieties in Leicester Square.\"\n\nSinden was colour blind and suffered from asthma, which prevented him from joining the armed forces during the Second World War and suffered from negative buoyancy, meaning that he was unable to float or swim in water, which was discovered while filming \"The Cruel Sea\" when the ship was sinking. Co-star Jack Hawkins saved him from drowning in the open-air water-tank at Denham Studios.\n\nSinden died at his home in Wittersham on the Isle of Oxney, Kent, on 12 September 2014, aged 90, from prostate cancer diagnosed several years earlier. Attending his funeral, held on 19 September at St John the Baptist Church, Wittersham, were his grandson Hal Sinden, Dame Judi Dench and Sir Patrick Stewart. The eulogy was read by Lord Archer. An Honorary Life Member and Trustee of the Garrick Club in London, which he joined in 1960, Donald Sinden was cremated in a coffin painted in the club's 'salmon and cucumber' colours.\n\nIt was announced that his estate on his death was valued at £2.3 million.\n\nA Blue Plaque in his memory was attached to his former family home in Hampstead Garden Suburb in 2015.\n\nSinden was married to the actress Diana Mahony from 3 May 1948 until her death from stomach cancer aged 77 in 2004. The couple had two sons: actor Jeremy Sinden (1950-1996), who died of lung cancer, and actor, film director and West End producer Marc Sinden (born 1954). Donald Sinden had four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.\n\n\n"}

According to stanzas 96-102 of the poem \"Hávamál\" from the \"Poetic Edda\", Odin was told by the maiden to meet her after nightfall when it would be safest and she would give herself to him, but when Odin returned he found the path blocked by warriors with swords and burning torches. When he came back at daybreak he discovered that the maiden was gone and had left a bitch tied to the bed in her place. In this way Odin was thwarted in his attempts to possess the girl. The episode is narrated in the first person by Odin himself and used by him as an example of the supposed fickleness and deception of women, and he laments the folly of longing for that which is unobtainable.\n\nBillingr was presumably either a giant or a dwarf, and John Lindow in \"Norse Mythology\" (2001) presents arguments for both possibilities. For example, Billing is listed as a dwarf name in the \"Hauksbók\" manuscript version of \"Völuspá\" and is found in a kenning for poetry: \"cup of the son of Billing.\" Since the dwarves and giants both possessed the Mead of Poetry before Odin obtained it, this kenning applies whether Billing is a dwarf or a giant. On the other hand, if Billing is a dwarf then his daughter would be one of the very few female dwarves in the mythology, while Odin's relations with giantesses are well attested throughout the Eddas.\n\n"}
{"id": "1815263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815263", "title": "K. Bhagyaraj", "text": "K. Bhagyaraj\n\nKrishnasaamy Bhagyaraj (born 7 January 1953) is an Indian Tamil director, actor, screenwriter, music director, producer and politician active mainly in Tamil films. He has also written and directed Telugu and Hindi films and TV serials. As an actor, he has worked in more than 75 films and has directed more than 25 films. He won a Filmfare Best Actor Award for \"Mundhanai Mudichu\" (1983). He received Lifetime achievement award in SIIMA (2014). He is the editor of weekly magazine \"Bhagya\" and has also written several novels.\n\nBhagyaraj was born in Vellankoil near Gobichettipalayam in Erode district in Tamil Nadu. His parents were Krishnaswamy and Amaravathiamma. He married twice. His first marriage was with actress Praveena, in 1981. She died due to an aggravated case of jaundice in August 1983. His second marriage was with actress Poornima Jayaram, who was his co-star in \"Darling, Darling, Darling\" (1982), on 7 February 1984. The couple has a daughter Saranya Bhagyaraj and a son Shanthnu Bhagyaraj.\n\nSince his childhood he had been huge fan of actors M. G. Ramachandran and Rajesh Khanna.\n\nBeginning his career as an assistant to directors G. Ramakrishnan and Bharathiraja, Bhagyaraj became recognised for his scriptwriting talent. He first appeared as a junior artist playing small supporting roles with screen-space of not more than three minutes in films such as \"Pathinaru Vayathinile\" and later appeared similarly in \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" (1978). He was assistant director to Bharatiraja in two films – \"16 Vayathnile\" and \"Kizhake Pogum Rail\". Among his early work was writing the script for Bharathiraja's films \"Kizhake Pogum Rail\" (1978) and \"Tik Tik Tik\" (1981), and writing dialogues for Sigappu Rojakkal. He made his directorial début with \"Suvarillatha Chiththirangal\" in 1979 and also his début as the leading man in \"Puthiya Vaarpugal\" in 1979, directed by Bharatiraja. He received the Best Dialogues Award for \"Puthiya Vaarpugal\" (1979). \"Kanni Paruvathile\", a film for which he wrote dialogues and screenplay and acted in a negative role, was a huge success. Though he had not achieved success as a director till 1979, he was motivated with success as the hero with \"Puthiya Vaarpugal\", a negative role, and as a writer of story and dialogues for \"Kanni Paruvathile\" and decided to write, direct and act for \"Oru Kai Oosai\", which, though not a huge success, gave him his first Best Actor Award.\n\nHe quickly established his own concern by 1980 and started producing and directing a string of distinctive films made mainly in the Tamil language. His first commercially successful main lead hero film was \"Bhama Rukmini\" in 1980. This film was neither directed, produced nor written by him. His voice was dubbed by someone else in all the films he did till 1980, including \"Bhama Rukmini\". Beginning with films such as \"Mouna Geetangal\", he started to dub his own lines in his films. He often stars in lead roles of the films he scripts and directs, effectively carving out a niche for himself in the actor-auteur vein. His style of film-making is notable for its relatively elaborate, witty, and double entendre-laced script and socially themed framework. His on-screen personae are typically characterised by their ironic sense of humour and intelligent bravado. The success of \"Bhama Rukmini\" was followed by 12 films directed by him – starring him as the main lead, which were box office hits – \"Vidiyum Vari Kaathiru\", \"Mouna Geethanagal\", \"Indru Poyi Naalai Vaa\", \"Antha Ezhu Natkal\", \"Thooral Ninnu Pochhu\", \"Poyi Satchi\", \"Darling Darling Darling\", \"Dhavani Kannavukal\", \"Munthanai Mudichu\", \"Chinna Veedu\", \"Enga Chinna Rasa\" and \"Idhu Namma Aalu\". From 1981 onwards, successful Tamil films written, directed by and starring him started being remade in Hindi, with the first being \"Mouna Geetangal\", remade as \"Ek Hi Bhool\" and \"Anztha Ezhu Natkal\" remade as \"Woh Saat Din\". In the period 1980–1990, he rarely acted in films not directed or written by him, with exceptions being \"Naan Sigappu Manithan\", \"Anbulla Rajinikanth\" and \"En Rathathin Rathame\". His next directorial venture \"Chithirame Chithirame\" was box office flop, and then he directed \"Mayadari Mogudu\" in Telugu, which was a success. He introduced actress Urvashi in the Tamil film \"Mundhanai Mudichu\" and actress Kalpana (sister of Urvashi) made her début with the 1985 film \"Chinna Veedu\", directed by Bhagyraj, a commercially successful film. He received the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor for his performance in \"Mundhanai Mudichu\". He became nationally famous when he wrote the script for \"Mundhanai Mudichu\" remade in Hindi as \"Masterji\" with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role, which was huge success at the box office. He decided to direct the Hindi remake of Bharatiraja's 1984 directorial venture \"Oru Kaidhiyin Diary\" with Rajesh Khanna in the lead in 1985, but later Khanna due to his date issues had to opt out and Bhagyaraj cast Amitabh Bachchan in the Hindi remake \"Aakhree Raasta\". Bhagayraj decided to remake the classic old Kannada film \"Mallammana Pavada\", starring Rajkumar and B Saroja Devi into a new Tamil film \"Enga Chinna Rasa\" in 1987, which became a huge blockbuster. In 1989, K. Balaji produced a Tamil remake of \"Mr. India\" as \"En Rathathin Rathame\" and the film was successful. In 1989, he wrote the script for \"Idhu Namma Allu\" and decided to produce it, but chose not to direct it by himself, as he wanted to act-write-direct a film on a serious issue, which was \"Aararo Aaariraro\". He received the Best Film Award for \"Idhu Namma Aalu\" in 1990, directed by Balakumar, whereas the other film \"Aararo Aaariraro\" also was both critically acclaimed and successful at box office. After the death of MGR in 1987, during a meeting with director C V Sridhar and producer Duraiswamay, an idea came across to Bhagyaraj to make use of the unfinished 1977 film \"Anna Nee En Deivam\", starring MGR and Lata and make the film \"Avasara Police 100\", starring himself as well in the lead. This 1990 film was widely promoted as a film with MGR and Bhagyaraj in lead roles and the film was a superhit.During 80's his market level is equal to Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan.\n\nFrom 1991, he gradually started accepting more acting offers as a lead hero, where director-producer-scriptwriter would be three different people, rather than he himself writing-directing-acting in his films. \"Rudhra\", \"Amma Vanthachu\", \"Gnanapazham\" (1996) and \"Suyamvaram\" (1999) were such successful films where he was involved only in the capacity of actor. He also started the weekly magazine \"Bhagya\" and he is the editor of that magazine. His successful directorial ventures written by him from 1991 on were \"Pavunnu Pavunuthan\", \"Sundara Kandam\", \"Raasukutti\", \"Veetla Visheshanga\", \"Oru Oorla oru Rajakumari\" and \"Vaettiya Madichu Kattu\". Failure of his Hindi directorial ventures \"Akhree Rasta\" and \"Mr. Bechara\" made Bhagyaraj decide that he should only write scripts for Hindi films and that he would not direct himself. He decided to remake \"Veetla Visheshanga\" as \"Mr Bechara\" in Hindi, but again his directorial venture in Hindi was not successful. He cast his son Shanthanu Bhagyaraj as the child artist in \"Vaettiya Madichu Kattu\" in 1998 and the film dealt with the father-son relationship. His successful Tamil films written by him continued to be in demand for Hindi remakes in the 1990s and were huge hits in Hindi – with \"Avasara Police 100\" remade into \"Gopi Kishen\", \"Sundara Kandam\" remade as \"Andaz\" (1994), \"Raasukutti\" remade as \"Raja Babu\", which were successful. He also wrote the script for the Tamil film \"Thaikulame Thaikulame\" (1995), starring Pandiarajan, whose actor-director was not himself in Hindi, remade as \"Gharwali-Baharwali\" (1998).\n\nHis assistant directors for his directorial ventures \"Darling Darling Darling\", \"Dhavani Kannavukal\", \"Munthanai Mudichu\" and \"Mayadari Mogudu\" was Pandiarajan, whereas Parthiban was his assistant director for \"Dhavani Kannavukal\"; later both Pandirajan and Parthiban went on to become director and actors.\n\nHe took a break from acting as the lead hero in Tamil films after the release of \"Vaettiya Madichu Kattu\" (1998) and \"Suyamvaram\" (1999) as he was not happy with new scripts from other banners offered to him in 2000, and so from 2000 to 2006 he did not accept any films as the lead hero. Instead, he directed the TV shows \"Neenga Nenaicha Saadhikkalanga\" and \"Idhu Oru Kadhayin Kadhai\" (for DD Podhigai), and appeared in \"Apapadi Podu\" on Jaya TV in this period. His tele-serial \"Rules Rangachari\" was very famous on DD channel and it completed 390 episodes. He wrote and directed the average 2003 film \"Chokka Thangam\", an action film starring Vijayakanth. He launched his daughter Saranya Bhagyaraj with \"Parijatham\", which he wrote and directed in 2006 and was a huge flop. He returned to acting with \"Something Something... Unakkum Enakkum\" and \"Rendu\" in a supporting role and with \"Kasu Irukkanum\" as the lead hero in 2007. From 2007 to present he has been seen in more films as an actor in supporting roles. He directed his adult son Shanthanu Bhagyaraj in the romantic film \"Siddhu +2\" in 2010. He ventured into Malayalam films as supporting actor with \"Mr Marumakan\".\n\nHe wrote books such as \"Vaanga Cinemavai Pattri Pesalam, Neenga Nenaicha Saadikkalaam\", \"Ungal Bhagyaraj in Kelvi Bhadhil\" (Five Parts) and has written seven novels.\nAnd now he is the leading judge for the show junior super star 3.O in ZEE TAMIZH\n\n\nMGR Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (MGR Popular Progressive Federation) was a political party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu launched by Bhagyaraj in February 1989. MGR MMK contested the 1991 Kerala assembly elections. It had one candidate, who got 87 votes. The MGR MMK party failed in its initial stages. Bhagyaraj later joined All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.\n\n"}
{"id": "1815264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815264", "title": "Clan Gordon", "text": "Clan Gordon\n\nClan Gordon, also known as the House of Gordon, is a Scottish clan. The chief of the clan is the powerful Earl of Huntly, and now also the Marquess of Huntly. During the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th century, the Gordons supported William Wallace in the cause of independence. In the 15th century, the chiefship of the clan passed to an heiress, who married into the Seton family and her male descendants assumed the surname Gordon and continued as chiefs of the clan. The Gordons assisted in defeating the rebellion of the Earl of Douglas also in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the Gordons as Catholics feuded with their Protestant neighbors the Clan Forbes and also defeated at the Battle of Glenlivet, the Protestant Earl of Argyll. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of the 17th century, the Gordons supported the Royalist cause. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Clan Gordon was Jacobite. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, their chief, then the Duke of Gordon, pledged his support to the British-Hanoverian Government, but his clan remained Jacobite. \n\nThe first Gordon on record is Richard of Gordon, previously of Swinton, said to have been the grandson of a famous knight who slew some monstrous animal in the Merse during the time of King Malcolm III of Scotland. This Richard was Lord of the Barony of Gordon in the Merse. Richard de (of) Gordon probably died around 1200. Between 1150 and 1160 he granted from his estate a piece of land to the Monks of St. Mary at Kelso, a grant which was confirmed by his son Thomas Gordon. Other notable Gordons from this time include Bertram de Gordon who wounded King Richard of England with an arrow at Châlons.\n\nAlicia Gordon, IV of the Gordon family was the heiress who married her cousin, Adam Gordon. Adam Gordon was a soldier who King Alexander III of Scotland sent with King Louis of France to Palestine. One tradition is that from Adam's grandson, Sir Adam, all of the Gordons in Scotland are descended. This Adam Gordon supported Sir William Wallace in 1297 to recapture the Castle of Wigtown from the English and Adam was made the Governor.\n\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence Sir Adam Gordon, who had supported William Wallace, renounced his subsequent acceptance of the claims of Edward I of England and became a staunch supporter of Robert the Bruce. Adam was killed leading the Clan Gordon at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333 but his son Sir Alexander Gordon escaped and was the first Gordon to be designated \"of Huntly\".\n\nChief Sir John Gordon was killed leading the clan at the Battle of Otterburn where the English were defeated in 1388. His son, Chief Sir Adam Gordon, was killed leading the clan at the Battle of Homildon Hill, also known as the Battle of Humbleton Hill on 14 September 1402. The chief left his only child, a daughter named Elizabeth Gordon who married Alexander Seton, who was the son of Sir William Seton, chief of Clan Seton.\n\nThe Battle of Arbroath was fought in 1445 where Patrick Gordon of Methlic, a cousin of the Earl of Huntly, was killed fighting the Clan Lindsay. From this Patrick Gordon the Earls of Aberdeen descend.\n\nIn 1449 Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Huntly, the eldest son of Elizabeth Gordon and Alexander Seton, Lord Gordon, changed the family name from Seton to Gordon.. His male heirs through his third wife Elizabeth Crichton continued to bear the name of Gordon and were chiefs of Clan Gordon.\n\nThe chief of Clan Lindsay, Alexander Lindsay, the 4th Earl of Crawford, was badly defeated by the Clan Gordon and Clan Ogilvy under Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly (previously Alexander Seton) at the Battle of Brechin in 1452.\n\nThe Gordons became involved in the deadly feud between the king and the Clan Douglas for power. The Gordons supported the king but when Gordon moved his forces south, the Earl of Moray who was an ally of the Douglases devastated the Gordon lands and burned Huntly Castle. However, the Gordons returned and soon defeated their enemies. Huntly Castle was rebuilt and when the Douglases were finally defeated the power of the Gordons grew unchallenged. In 1454 the Douglasses broke out in rebellion again and when confronted with the king in the south and Huntly in the north were soundly defeated, effectively ending the confederacy of the Douglasses, Rosses and Crawfords. For his notable contributions Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly was styled \"Cock o' the North\", a designation which has ever since been accorded to the heads of clan Gordon.\n\nIn 1513, during the Anglo-Scottish Wars, the Clan Gordon led by Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly fought at the Battle of Flodden.\n\nIn 1526 the title of Earl of Sutherland and chieftenship of the Clan Sutherland passed by right of marriage to Adam Gordon who was a younger son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly.\n\nLater during the Anglo-Scottish Wars, George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly defeated an English army at the Battle of Haddon Rig in 1542 but the Gordons were later part of the Scottish army which was defeated at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547.\n\nChief George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly was General of the forces on the Borders who opposed the forces of Henry VIII of England and Gordon had many victorious encounters. He was however later killed at the Battle of Corrichie in 1562 fighting against the forces of James Stuart, Earl of Moray (half-brother to Mary Queen of Scots). Gordon was killed and his son, Sir John, and other members of his family were later executed at Aberdeen.\n\nThroughout the 16th century the Clan Gordon were involved in a long and bitter struggle against the Clan Forbes. In the 1520s there were murders by both sides, and one of the most prominent killed by the Forbeses was Seton of Meldrum who was a close connection of the Earl of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon. The Earl of Huntly then became involved in a plot against the \"Master of Forbes\", who was the son of the sixth Lord Forbes. The sixth Lord Forbes had been heavily implicated of the murder of Seton of Meldrum. The Master of Forbes was accused by the Earl of Huntly of conspiring to assassinate James V of Scotland in 1536 by shooting at him with a cannon. The Master of Forbes was tried and executed however just days later his conviction was reversed and the Forbes family was restored to favor. The Protestant Reformation added to the feud between the Clan Forbes and Clan Gordon in that the Gordons remained Catholic and the Forbeses became Protestant. The traditional enemies of the Forbses such as the Clan Leslie, Clan Irvine and Clan Seton sided with the Gordons while Protestant families such as the Clan Keith, Clan Fraser and Clan Crichton sided with the Clan Forbes. Twenty Gordons were killed at a banquet held at the Forbes's Druminnor Castle in 1571. Later in 1571 the feud climaxed with the Battle of Tillieangus, and the Battle of Craibstone, and Druminnor, then the seat of the chief of Clan Forbes was plundered. The Gordons followed this up with the massacre of twenty seven Forbeses of Towie at Corgarff Castle. It took two Acts of Parliament for the clans to put down their arms.\n\nIn 1594 the forces of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly defeated the forces of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll at the Battle of Glenlivet.\n\nThe register of the Privy Seal records that in 1615 a complaint was made from Alexander Leask of the Clan Leask that Adam Gordon, brother of the Laird of Gight, put violent hands upon him at the Yet of Leask, wounding him grievously. Later that year the Gordons again attacked the Leasks, setting upon a son of the chief for which George Gordon was outlawed. In 1616, William Leask of that Ilk was accosted by John Gordon of Ardlogy and a party of men with \"pistolets and hagbuts.\"\n\nIn the early 17th century Clan Gordon had a number of alliances by marriage or friendship. Among these was a strong bond to the Clan Burnett of Leys. The Gordon crest is emblazoned in plasterwork on the ceiling of the early 17th century great hall of Muchalls Castle built by Alexander Burnett.\n\nIn 1644 Alexander Bannerman of Pitmedden fought a duel with his cousin, Sir George Gordon of Haddo, and wounded him. Also in 1644 during the Civil War at the Battle of Aberdeen there were Gordons on both sides. Lord Lewis Gordon led his forces on the side of the Covenanters while Sir Nathaniel Gordon led his forces in support of the Royalists.\n\nDuring the Civil War the second Marquess of Huntly was a fierce royalist and his followers have passed into history as the \"Gordon Horse\" and they figured very prominently in the campaigns of the great James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Cavalry from the Clan Gordon fought in support of the royalists at the Battle of Auldearn in 1645 where they helped to defeat the Covenanters of Lord Seaforth. The Clan Gordon fought at the Battle of Alford in 1645 where they were victorious, led by George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly. The Marquess of Huntly's eldest son George Gordon fell at this battle. Also in 1645, Lewis Gordon, clan chief and 3rd Marquess of Huntly burned Brodie Castle of the Clan Brodie.\n\nIn 1682 William Gordon of Cardoness Castle, was killed in a fight with Sir Godfrey McCulloch. McCulloch fled Scotland for a time, but returned, only to be apprehended and executed in 1697. \n\nThe Gordons fought on both sides during both the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745. The second Duke of Gordon followed the Jacobites in 1715 and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 1,000 men.\n\nCosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon supported the British Government during the rising of 1745. However, his brother, Lord Lewis Gordon, raised two Jacobite regiments against the Hanoverians. The Gordon Jacobites fought at the Battle of Inverurie (1745), the Battle of Falkirk (1746) and the Battle of Culloden (1746).\n\nTwo regiments named the \"Gordon Highlanders\" have been raised from the Clan Gordon. The first was the 81st Regiment of Foot (Aberdeenshire Highland Regiment) formed in 1777 by the Hon. Colonel William Gordon, son of the Earl of Aberdeen and was disbanded in 1783. The second was the 92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot raised by Alexander the 4th Duke of Gordon in 1794.\n\n\nClan Gordon has several recognized tartans:\n\n\nThe Gordon Modern tartan was used by The Gordon Highlanders, (now The Highlanders (4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland)) and is sometimes referred to as \"Military\". The tartan itself is based on the Black Watch military tartan with an additional yellow stripe. The difference between the family sett (modern) and military sett is only in the pleating of the kilt. The military pleat to the stripe, showing a series of stripes across the back of the kilt. The family sett is pleated to the sett, showing the repeat of the pattern in its entirety across the back of the kilt. The Red Gordon tartan is sometimes referred to as \"Huntly\".\n\nThe Gordon Modern tartan was used for many years as the troop tartan for the 10th Finchley (Scottish) Scout Group, London N3.. The Scout Group was and still is unique in being the only group south of the border to wear kilts and actively maintains its links with the Gordon clan. Every four years (with a few exceptions) they camp in the grounds of Aboyne castle and the Marquess would often attend Burns night dinners as the guest of honour at the scout hall. The groups pipe band always play \"The Cock of the North 6/8 March\" when returning to their hall following parades and every member wears a badge bearing the stags head that forms part of the clan crest. A picture of the band outside their current scout hall shows all members wearing Gordon Tartan kilts and\nThe ties go further with the address of the scout hall being Gordon Hall, Huntly Drive, West Finchley, London, N3.\n\nCastles that have been owned by the Clan Gordon include amongst many others:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815269", "title": "Vates", "text": "Vates\n\nIn modern English, the nouns vates () and ovate (, ), are used as technical terms for ancient Celtic bards, prophets and philosophers. The terms correspond to a Proto-Celtic word which can be reconstructed as *\"wātis\". They are sometimes also used as English equivalents to later Celtic terms such as Irish \"\" \"prophet, seer\".\n\nThe terminology discussed in this article relates to an Old Celtic word which can be reconstructed as *\"wātis\". This word is not directly attested, but is known from renderings into Greek and Latin and from its descendants in later Celtic languages.\n\n\"Vates\" in English is a borrowing of a Latin noun \"vātēs\" (), 'prophet, poet'. This Latin noun was either a cognate of Celtic *\"wātis\" (whereby the two words were descended from a common Italo-Celtic origin), or the Latin word was a loanword directly from Celtic. Despite being borrowed from the Latin form, the English word is generally used about ancient Celtic seers rather than Roman ones.\n\n\"Ovate\" in English is a borrowing and adaptation of a Greek rendering of the same Celtic term *\"wātis\", first attested in the work of the Ancient Greek writer Strabo. Strabo rendered the Celtic term in Greek as \"ouáteis\" (, ). The English word \"ovate\" is pronounced the way it is due to a misunderstanding of how the Greek word was pronounced.\n\nProto-Celtic *\"wātis\" developed in medieval Irish as \"prophet, seer\". Less directly, it is related to \"gwawd\" \"panegyric\" in Welsh.\n\nCeltic \"wātis\" is widely thought to have cognates in the Germanic languages, such as the Gothic term \"wods\" 'possessed' (though Ludwig Rübekeil 2003 has suggested that the name of the Germanic god ' may in fact be an early loanword, an adjective \"*\" based on Celtic ').\n\nIf the Celtic word *\"wātis\", the Latin \"vates\", and similar Germanic words are cognates rather than borrowings, they can be derived from an Indo-European word \" \"seer\".\n\nVirgil uses the Latin ' \"winnowing fan\" (conceivably from ', compare Old High German ', modern German ', with the same meaning, from \") for something borne about in the Bacchic festival, suggesting that the root may have had an ecstatic sense in Italic also. The likelihood of this etymology and its relevance to the word \"vates\" is, however, doubtful.\n\nThe earliest Latin writers used \"vates\" to denote prophets and soothsayers in general; the word fell into disuse in Latin until it was revived by Virgil. Thus Ovid could describe himself as the \"\" of Eros (\"Amores\" 3.9).\n\nIn pagan Rome the vates resided on the Vatican Hill, the Hill of the Vates. The Vatican Hill takes its name from the Latin word Vaticanus, a vaticiniis ferendis, in allusion to the oracles, or Vaticinia, which were anciently delivered on the Vatican Hill. (When the papacy was returned to Rome from Avignon (France) in the 14th Century, the Vatican became the residence of the Pope, and the word Vatican came to refer to the enclave in the middle of Rome that had become the seat of the Roman Catholic Church.)\n\nAccording to the Ancient Greek writers Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Poseidonius, the \"\" () were one of three classes of Celtic priesthood, the other two being the druids and the bards. The Vates had the role of seers and performed sacrifices (in particular administering human sacrifice) under the authority of a druid according to Roman and Christian interpretation.\n\n\"Vates\" or \"Ovates\" make up one of the three grades of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, a neo-druidism order based in England. \n\nAn ovate is also the initial level one can attain in the modern Welsh Gorsedd of Bards. The Gorsedd is not a neo-druidic entity like the one mentioned above, but is more concerned with Welsh arts and culture; however, the ceremony and practices are largely based on reimaginings of druidism by Iolo Morganwg.\n\n\n"}

There was widespread unrest, with organized revolts in both northern and sub-Saharan colonies including the Algerian War in French Algeria, the Angolan War of Independence in Portuguese Angola, the Congo Crisis in the Belgian Congo, and the Mau Mau Uprising in British Kenya.\n\nThe \"Scramble for Africa\" between 1870 and 1900 ended with almost all of Africa being controlled by a small number of European states. Racing to secure as much land as possible while avoiding conflict amongst themselves, the partition of Africa was confirmed in the Berlin Agreement of 1885, with little regard to local differences. By 1905, control of almost all African soil was claimed by Western European governments, with the only exceptions being Liberia (which had been settled by African-American former slaves) and Ethiopia (then occupied by Italy in 1936). Britain and France had the largest holdings, but Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal also had colonies. As a result of colonialism and imperialism, a majority of Africa lost sovereignty and control of natural resources such as gold and rubber. The introduction of imperial policies surfacing around local economies led to the failing of local economies due to an exploitation of resources and cheap labor. Progress towards independence was slow up until the mid-20th century. By 1977, 54 African countries had seceded from European colonial rulers.\n\nDuring the world wars, African soldiers were conscripted into imperial militaries. This led to a deeper political awareness and the expectation of greater respect and self-determination, which was left largely unfulfilled. During the 1941 Atlantic Conference, the British and the US leaders met to discuss ideas for the post-war world. One of the provisions added by President Roosevelt was that all people had the right to self-determination, inspiring hope in British colonies.\n\nOn February 12, 1941, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met to discuss the postwar world. The result was the Atlantic Charter. It was not a treaty and was not submitted to the British Parliament or the Senate of the United States for ratification, but it turned out to be a widely acclaimed document. One of the provisions, introduced by Roosevelt, was the autonomy of imperial colonies. After World War II, the US and the African colonies put pressure on Britain to abide by the terms of the Atlantic Charter. After the war, some Britons considered African colonies to be childish and immature; British colonisers introduced democratic government at local levels in the colonies. Britain was forced to agree but Churchill rejected universal applicability of self-determination for subject nations. He also stated that the Charter was only applicable to German occupied states, not to the British Empire.\n\nFurthermore, colonies such as Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana pushed for self-governance as colonial powers were exhausted by war efforts.\n\nFor early African nationalists, decolonisation was a moral imperative. In 1945 the Fifth Pan-African Congress demanded the end of colonialism. Delegates included future presidents of Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and national activists.\n\nColonial economic exploitation led to European extraction of Ghana’s mining profits to shareholders, instead of internal development, causing major local socioeconomic grievances. Nevertheless, local African industry and towns expanded when U-boats patrolling the Atlantic Ocean reduced raw material transportation to Europe. In turn, urban communities, industries and trade unions grew, improving literacy and education, leading to pro-independence newspaper establishments.\n\nIndeed, in the 1930s, the colonial powers had cultivated, sometimes inadvertently, a small elite of leaders educated in Western universities and familiar with ideas such as self-determination. In some cases where the road to independence was fought, settled arrangements with the colonial powers were also being placed. These leaders came to lead the struggles for independence, and included leading nationalists such as Jomo Kenyatta (Kenya), Kwame Nkrumah (Gold Coast, now Ghana), Julius Nyerere (Tanganyika, now Tanzania), Léopold Sédar Senghor (Senegal), Nnamdi Azikiwe (Nigeria), and Félix Houphouët-Boigny (Côte d'Ivoire).\n\nThere is an extensive body of literature that has examined the legacy of colonialism and colonial institutions on economic outcomes in Africa, with numerous studies showing an adverse and persistent impact of colonialism.\n\nThe economic legacy of colonialism is difficult to quantify but is likely to have been negative. Modernisation theory emphasises that colonial powers built infrastructure to integrate Africa into the world economy, however, this was built mainly for extraction purposes. African economies were structured to benefit the coloniser and any surplus was likely to be ‘drained’, thereby stifling capital accumulation. Dependency theory suggests that most African economies continued to occupy a subordinate position in the world economy after independence with a reliance on primary commodities such as copper in Zambia and tea in Kenya. Despite this continued reliance and unfair trading terms, a meta-analysis of 18 African countries found that a third of countries experienced increased economic growth post-independence.\n\nScholars including Dellal (2013), Miraftab (2012) and Bamgbose (2011) have argued that Africa’s linguistic diversity has been eroded. Language has been used by western colonial powers to divide territories and create new identities which has led to conflicts and tensions between African nations.\n\nFollowing World War II, rapid decolonisation swept across the continent of Africa as many territories gained their independence from European colonisation.\n\nIn August 1941, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met to discuss their post-war goals. In that meeting, they agreed to the Atlantic Charter, which in part stipulated that they would, \"respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.\" This agreement became the post-WWII stepping stone toward independence as nationalism grew throughout Africa.\n\nConsumed with post-war debt, European powers were no longer able to afford the resources needed to maintain control of their African colonies. This allowed for African nationalists to negotiate decolonisation very quickly and with minimal casualties. Some territories, however, saw great death tolls as a result of their fight for independence.\n\nOn 6 March 1957, Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast) became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence from European colonisation. Starting in 1945 Pan-African Congress, Gold Coast’s British- and American-educated independence leader Kwame Nkrumah made his focus clear. In the conference’s declaration, he wrote, “we believe in the rights of all peoples to govern themselves. We affirm the right of all colonial peoples to control their own destiny. All colonies must be free from foreign imperialist control, whether political or economic.”\nIn 1949, the conflict would ramp up when British troops opened fire on African protesters. Riots broke out across the territory and while Nkrumah and other leaders ended up in prison, the event became a catalyst for the independence movement. After being released from prison, Nkrumah founded the Convention People’s Party (CPP), which launched a mass-based campaign for independence with the slogan ‘Self Government Now!’” Heightened nationalism within the country grew their power and the political party widely expanded. In February of 1951, the Convention People's Party gained political power by winning 34 of 38 elected seats, including one for Nkrumah who was imprisoned at the time. London revised the Gold Coast Constitution to give Blacks a majority in the legislature in 1951. In 1956 they requested independence inside the Commonwealth, which was granted peacefully in 1957 with Nkrumah as prime minister and Queen Elizabeth as sovereign.\n\nPrime Minister Harold Macmillan gave the famous \"Wind of Change\" speech in South Africa in February 1960, where he spoke of \"the wind of change blowing through this continent\". Macmillan urgently wanted to avoid the same kind of colonial war that France was fighting in Algeria. Under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly.\n\nBritain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968. British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau Uprising. In Rhodesia, the 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the white minority resulted in a civil war that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War when the Vichy France regime controlled the Empire. But one after another most of the colonies were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle, who uses colonial base as a launching point to expel Vichy from Metropolitan France. De Gaulle together with most Frenchmen (except the Communists) was committed to preserving the Empire in the new form. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolués, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France.\n\nDe Gaulle assembled a major conference of Free France colonies in Brazzaville, in Africa, in January–February, 1944. The survival of France depended on support from these colonies, and De Gaulle made numerous concessions. They included the end of forced labor, the end of special legal restrictions that apply to natives but not to whites, the establishment of elected territorial assemblies, representation in Paris in a new \"French Federation\", and the eventual representation of Sub-Saharan Africans in the French Assembly. However, Independence was explicitly rejected as a future possibility: \n\nFrance was immediately confronted with the beginnings of the decolonisation movement. In Algeria demonstrations in May 1945 were repressed with an estimated 6,000 Algerians killed. Unrest in Haiphong, Indochina, in November 1945 was met by another warship bombarding the city. Paul Ramadier's (SFIO) cabinet repressed the Malagasy Uprising in Madagascar in 1947. French officials estimated the number of Malagasy killed from a low of 11,000 to a French Army estimate of 89,000.\n\nIn France's African colonies, Cameroun, the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon's insurrection, started in 1955 and headed by Ruben Um Nyobé, was violently repressed over a two-year period, with perhaps as many as 100 people killed.\n\nFrench involvement in Algeria stretched back a century. Ferhat Abbas and Messali Hadj's movements had marked the period between the two wars, but both sides radicalised after the Second World War. In 1945, the Sétif massacre was carried out by the French army. The Algerian War started in 1954. Atrocities characterized both sides, and the number killed became highly controversial estimates that were made for propaganda purposes. Algeria was a three-way conflict due to the large number of \"pieds-noirs\" (Europeans who had settled there in the 125 years of French rule). The political crisis in France caused the collapse of the Fourth Republic, as Charles de Gaulle returned to power in 1958 and finally pulled the French soldiers and settlers out of Algeria by 1962. Lasting more than eight years, the estimated death toll typically falls between 300,000 and 400,000 people. By 1958, the FLN was able to negotiate peace accord with French President Charles de Gaulle and nearly 90% of all Europeans had left the territory.\n\nThe French Union was replaced in the new 1958 Constitution of 1958 by the French Community. Only Guinea refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of overseas \"départements\" (territories). Critics of neocolonialism claimed that the \"Françafrique\" had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of Jacques Foccart, his counsellor for African matters. Foccart supported in particular the Nigerian Civil War during the late 1960s.\n\nRobert Aldrich argues that with Algerian independence in 1962, it appeared that the Empire practically had come to an end, as the remaining colonies were quite small and lacked active nationalist movements. However, there was trouble in French Somaliland (Djibouti), which became independent in 1977. There also were complications and delays in the New Hebrides Vanuatu, which was the last to gain independence in 1980. New Caledonia remains a special case under French suzerainty. The Indian Ocean island of Mayotte voted in referendum in 1974 to retain its link with France and forgo independence.\n\nThis table is the arranged by the earliest date of independence in this graph; 58 countries have seceded.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815333", "title": "Massie Trial", "text": "Massie Trial\n\nThe Massie Trial, for what was known as the Massie Affair, was a 1932 criminal trial that took place in Honolulu, Hawaii. Socialite Grace Fortescue, along with several accomplices, was charged with murder in the death of well-known local prizefighter Joseph Kahahawai. Fortescue was the mother of Thalia Massie, who had brought charges that Kahahawai was one of a group of men who had raped her.\n\nGrace Hubbard Fortescue, \"née\" Grace Hubbard Bell, was the granddaughter of Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the first president of the National Geographic Society. Her father, Charles John Bell, was first cousin of inventor Alexander Graham Bell. Her marriage to Major Granville \"Rolly\" Fortescue, an out-of-wedlock son of Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, did not leave her as financially successful as she would have wished, but she nevertheless kept up appearances and raised her daughter, Thalia, with an American upper class lifestyle.\n\nThalia Fortescue married Lieutenant Thomas Massie, a rising United States Navy officer. In 1930, Massie arrived at Pearl Harbor, where Thalia considered herself \"above\" the rest of the officers' wives and soon became an outcast. The marriage, apparently not terribly successful to start with, degenerated into heavy drinking and public fights. Thalia had a second miscarriage shortly prior to the incident, and was \"on probation\" with her husband, who wrote an informal set of conditions under which he would continue the marriage.\n\nIn 1931, the Honolulu police force was bitterly split between two factions: the McIntosh faction, led by Captain Nelson McIntosh, which consisted mostly of white officers; and the Hao faction, led by Deputy Sheriff David Hao, which consisted mostly of police officers of Hawaiian heritage. Both factions had political backing McIntosh was the choice of Hawaii's business elite, while Hao had the backing of still politically powerful Hawaiian royalty. McIntosh was regarded as a racist by indigenous Hawaiians, while Hao's faction was considered corrupt by McIntosh's faction. Patrick K. Gleason, the sheriff of Honolulu, tried to keep peace within his department as he needed the votes of both factions to win re-election.\n\nThings got particularly heated in August 1931, when Hao was forced into retirement. While the retirement itself was not finalized, McIntosh temporarily took over his position, with all of the detectives formally reporting to him. However, as McIntosh was hostile to detectives from Hao's faction, Sheriff Gleason would give some of them direct assignments, thus retaining the parallel command structure.\n\nTwo of the accused - Joseph Kahahawai and Ben Ahakuelo - were well known local sportsmen. Kahahawai was a boxer, and Ahakuelo both participated in boxing and played in semi-professional football leagues.\n\nOn September 12, 1931, the Massies, the Browns and Bransons - all Navy couples - attended a Navy event at the Ala Wai Inn, a Waikiki nightclub. At about 11:30 p.m., Thalia had an argument with a Lieutenant Stogsdal, which ended with her slapping an officer and then storming out. Thomas, not having witnessed the event, assumed she was tired and had gone home, and stayed at the nightclub. Meanwhile, at some time between 11:30 and 12:00, Thalia left the Ala Wai Inn. She claimed to have walked towards Waikiki Park - a dance hall a few hundred meters from the nightclub, which had a dance that night as well. The dance was normally scheduled to end at 11:45, but ended closer to 11:55 that night. \n\nAt some time between 12:20 and 12:45, Thalia was picked up by a car driving along Ala Moana road, a relatively isolated road that connected Waikiki to Honolulu which was often used as lover's lane by locals. The car was occupied by the Berringer and Clark families, who were the first to definitely recognize Thalia after she left Ala Wai Inn. According to their testimony, Thalia claimed that she was assaulted and robbed (but not raped) by several Hawaiian men. She declined police intervention and asked to be taken home; she got there at about 1 a.m. However, the driver made several mistakes while driving there, so it was not the shortest route. As Thomas was still not home and she did not have keys, Thalia had to break through the back door to get inside.\n\nThe last dance at Ala Wai Inn was supposed to stop at 12 a.m.; however, the patrons didn't let the orchestra stop until 1 a.m. At that time, Thomas tried to look for his wife once more, but gave up and went for an after-party at Rigby's home, where the Navy officers were supposed to meet after the evening. He was accompanied by Lieutenant Branson, whose wife left with their car. However, there was no party at Rigby's, so Branson fell asleep there, and Thomas went for some late snacks. Thomas tried to call his wife to make sure she had arrived safely—after several calls she finally answered. She told Thomas to come home immediately, as something terrible had happened to her. Thomas took the car and left, leaving the sleeping Branson behind. \n\nAs Thomas arrived home, Thalia told him about the assault. Over her objections, Thomas immediately phoned the police, who arrived to take her statement. Initially she could not provide any details at all, stating that it was too dark to identify any of the men or to see any details of the car they emerged from. However, Thalia changed her story several hours later, not only describing the assailants as \"locals\", but giving police a license plate number.\n\nWithin hours the police arrested a Japanese-American man named Horace Ida. Ida was not entirely surprised at first, as only a few hours earlier he had been involved in a near collision while driving his sister's car with several friends, including Kahahawai and Ahakuelo. Although there was no damage, an argument broke out with the couple driving the other car, which culminated in Kahahawai slugging the woman. Upon his arrival at the police station, the charges with the altercation were never brought up – instead he found to his dismay that he was being charged with rape.\n\nAt first glance, the story seemed to be credible. Thalia's license plate was off by only one digit (or letter) and her description of the men, Ida and his friends, was fairly accurate. However, it later became known that the police taking Thalia's statement had in fact \"told her\" both pieces of information, apparently after hearing the name and description from the initial complaint filed by the woman driver. Riccio offers the following account of the incident involving Horace Ida:\n\nHorace Ida, a young Japanese man, had borrowed his sister's two-year-old car and had attended a luau accompanied by his pals Joe Kahahawai, Benny Ahakuelo, David Takai and Henry Chang. At about 12:30 A.M, Horace suggested they call it a night. He and his friends piled into the car and left the luau.\n\nAs the car passed through an intersection in downtown Honolulu, Horace barely missed colliding with an automobile coming from the opposite direction. There was no contact between the two cars, but both drivers stopped and everyone piled out to argue the fine points of Hawaiian motor vehicle law.\n\nThe occupants of the other car were a Mr. and Mrs. Peeples. Mrs. Peeples was voicing her opinion of Horace Ida's driving skills when Big Joe Kahahawai (all six feet and more of him) hauled off and punched her in the face. Mrs. Peeples was equal to the challenge. She gave as good as she got. She clenched her fist, wound up, and to Big Joe's surprise, slugged him in the mouth! The incident was about to become a donnybrook. However, cooler heads prevailed, and the Peeples drove off to the police station to report the incident.\n\nAt the station, the Peeples gave Horace Ida's license plate as 58-895, and the police put out an all points bulletin for the car and its occupants. At about the same time, the police learned of the rape in Ala Moana Park, so it was only natural that they would assume that the occupants of the Ida car were more than likely the perpetrators of the assault on Thalia Massie.\n\nHorace Ida and his friends were eventually located through the car's license plate and were brought before Thalia at the police station. She was unable to identify Horace Ida, who was wearing a brown leather jacket when she saw him. When asked the license number of the assailants' car, she did not remember it, but she later heard the plate number 58-895 being broadcast at the police station.\n\nThe next day, under further questioning, Thalia's story began to change. She now \"remembered\" that one of her assailants had been wearing a brown leather jacket and the license plate of the assailants' car was 58-805 (only one digit was different from the number of Horace Ida's plate). To the police, the case against Horace Ida and his friends began to look stronger. The five men insisted they were not part of any assault on a lone white woman walking through the darkness of John Ena Road. They explained their movements on the night at length. But the police were not persuaded. The five young men were indicted and charged with rape and assault.\n\nRear Admiral Yates Stirling, Jr., Commandant of the US Navy's 14th Naval District (which included the Hawaiian islands), indicated that his first inclination was to lynch the accused assailants, but that they must give \"the authorities a chance to carry out the law and not interfere.\"\n\nAs the case developed, cracks in Thalia's story immediately appeared. In order to have assaulted Thalia – an event so far unproven to have even occurred – it would have been extremely difficult to have then been involved in the near accident across town. The police themselves were split on the case; many of the detectives were locals who saw the case was a sham and, when they were denied access in the courtroom, started to talk directly to the press.\n\nRiccio:\n\nWhile the good citizens of Honolulu waited for the trial to begin, rumors began to develop and spread through the city. There were those who whispered that Thalia had not been raped at all. It was said that she was having an illicit relationship with one of the five beach boy suspects, and that she was on her way to a rendezvous with him when she found him in the company of four drunken friends.\n\nIt was also speculated that Thalia was having an affair with one of Tommie's shipmates. When Tommie came home after the party, so the gossip went, he found his wife and his friend \"in flagrante delicto\" and it was Tommie who beat up his wife and broke her jaw.\n\nGrace Fortescue, enraged by the stories and what she saw as an attempt to sully the name of her daughter and the family, started a public campaign to attack the defendants. However, the case quickly fell apart in court. After a three-week trial and lengthy jury deliberation, the jurors declared themselves deadlocked and a mistrial was declared.\n\nGrace was not willing to wait for another trial. She first arranged for the kidnapping and vicious beating of Ida, then talked Thomas into kidnapping Kahahawai, the darkest skinned of the five defendants, with the help of two Navy enlisted men—Albert O. Jones and Edward J. Lord. Kahahawai underwent \"interrogation\", as Grace, Thomas and the two Navy men attempted to beat a confession out of him—eventually, one of the group of four shot Kahahawai.\nDebating what to do, the group eventually decided to dump Kahahawai's body off Koko Head, at the time a desolate area far away from urban Honolulu. Although he would eventually be found, it seemed to them unlikely that anyone would care. They wrapped Kahahawai in a sheet and put him in Fortescue's rented car, pulling down the shades to hide the interior. A police motorcyclist, alerted to the kidnapping, saw the blinds and considered it suspicious. He pulled them over, discovered Kahahawai's body and immediately arrested all four on suspicion of murder.\n\nClarence Darrow decided to take on the group's defense for the sum of $30,000. He was brought out of retirement by Eva Stotesbury, an old family friend and the. wife of Edward T. Stotesbury.\n\nThroughout the trial, Thalia attempted to present herself as an innocent victim. This fell apart when the prosecutor, John Kelley, played on her feelings of superiority. She became enraged, ripped up a piece of evidence, and stormed from the stand. Although this would seem to be a prosecution victory, the courtroom erupted in supportive applause from the spectators.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder. Racial tensions were so high that everyone had expected another hung jury. The mainland press exploded with even more stories and the situation in Hawaii grew more tense. Martial law was considered by Admiral Stirling if rioting were to begin, as he had considered imposing it from the start.\n\nAfter a flurry of diplomatic maneuvering between Washington, D.C. and Honolulu, martial law was avoided. Instead, under pressure from the Navy, Territorial Governor Lawrence M. Judd commuted the 10-year sentences of the convicted killers to one hour, to be served in his office. Days later the entire group, including the Massies, the two other Navy men, Fortescue and Darrow, boarded a ship and left the island in turmoil. Thalia and Massie divorced in 1934; she committed suicide in 1963; he died in 1987. Grace Hubbard Fortescue died in 1979. Albert Jones died on September 23, 1966. Edward Lord died in 1967.\n\nIn 1966, while being interviewed by author Peter Van Slingerland, Albert O. Jones admitted that he was the one who shot Joseph Kahahawai.\n\nAlthough the prosecution's lead witness, Thalia Massie, had left the Territory and could not be forced to return to testify, the four surviving Ala Moana defendants could not be exonerated immediately. As Peter Van Slingland wrote, \"Congress, the Navy, and mainland public opinion would not allow the charges to be dropped without good reason.\" Before the subsequent dismissal of the charges, Governor Judd hired the Pinkerton's National Detective Agency to further investigate and to review the evidence. The Pinkerton agency responded with a 279-page report, in which the introductory letter stated:\nAn analysis of the reports of our representatives, together, with the reports and statements of the Attorney General's office, the office of the Public Prosecutor, and the Police Department, also the testimony at the trial of the defendants, makes it impossible to escape the conviction that the kidnaping and assault was not caused by those accused, with the attendant circumstances alleged by Mrs. Massie.\n\nIn February 1986, CBS-TV aired a four-hour miniseries produced by Lorimar Productions titled \"Blood & Orchids\", written for television by Norman Katkov, who based his teleplay on his own novel of the same title. Though Katkov said that he based his novel on the Massie Affair, his novel and teleplay bear only a superficial resemblance to fact. Katkov changed all the names of the principal characters and added other characters for whom no historical warrant can be found (most notably, Police Captain Curtis Maddox, supposedly the one conscientious law-enforcement officer who ever investigated the affair). Katkov's story also departs significantly from actual events in many ways, such as making the murder of Kahahawai look like a crime of passion—and laying all the blame on Lieutenant Massie and not on Grace Fortescue.\n\nMax Allan Collins's 1996 novel, \"Damned in Paradise\", follows the facts of the case more closely than Katkov's book. An entry in his series about Depression-era private eye Nate Heller, \"Damned in Paradise\" casts Heller as the personal investigator for Darrow after the famed attorney is retained to represent Lt. Massie, Grace Fortescue, and the other defendants accused of Kahahawai's murder. Collins also includes fictionalized depictions of such historical figures as John Jardine, one of the actual Honolulu police detectives who investigated the case, and Chang Apana, the real-life inspiration for Charlie Chan, who was still an active-duty detective in HPD at the time of the Massie case (though there's no official record to suggest that Chang was actually one of the investigating officers). As is often the case in the Heller series, Collins provides an alternate solution as to who might have been responsible for Mrs. Massie's rape.\n\nIn his afterword to \"Damned in Paradise\", Collins suggested that Robert Traver's 1958 novel, \"Anatomy of a Murder\", was loosely inspired by the Massie case, involving, as it does, a military officer who murders the alleged rapist of his wife and the subsequent trial arising from that murder, with the setting changed from Honolulu to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and the Naval officer changed to an Army officer. However, in 1952 Traver himself defended an Army officer accused of the murder of his wife's alleged attacker, and, despite the striking parallels to the Massie incident, it is more likely that this was the case from which Traver derived his plot.\n\nThe case was revisited in 2016 by Investigation Discovery's series \"A Crime to Remember\" (Season 4 Episode 4, \"Paradise Lost\").\n\nThe Offshore podcast in 2016, by Honolulu Civil Beat and PRX, covered the Massie Case in episode 4, \"A Sinister Past.\"\n\nDuring the American Bar Association convention at the Hawai'i Convention Center in Honolulu, on August 3, 2006, Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona served as the judge at the mock trial, using a copy of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency report compiled by the then Territorial Government and using 21st century forensic techniques, looked into the rape case once more. Lawyers attending the convention acted as the Jury.\n\nAfter testimony from two experts, and new arguments about the case, the lawyers voted with a unanimous \"Not guilty\" verdict for all defendants. Among other deciding factors was the defense's evidence that the five men accused of the rape had been involved in violence on the other side of Honolulu (the near collision with the Peeples's car) near the time of the alleged attack on Massie and would not have been able to reach Waikiki in time to have also raped Massie as she described.\n\nIn a coincidental historical twist, the Hawaii Convention Center — where the mock trial was held — sits on the former site of the Ala Wai Inn, where the case first started.\n\n\n"}

Following an apprenticeship to civil engineer Sir John Rennie, he travelled to California after hearing news of the California Gold Rush of 1849. He arrived in British Columbia in 1859, following the Fraser River gold rush of 1858.\n\nHe found employment by working various government contracts as a surveyor, and in 1862 was contracted to construct a portion of the Cariboo Road between Chapmans Bar and Boston Bar along the canyon of the Fraser River. Tolls collected from a suspension bridge along the road, along with prudent land acquisitions, made Trutch a wealthy man.\n\nBeginning in the 1860s, Trutch became involved in colonial politics, serving as the Chief Commissioner of Land and Works, and became a well-known resident of Victoria. As the Chief Commissioner of Land and Works, he was a member of the Legislative Council of British Columbia in the colony. Throughout his political career, Trutch was noted for his hostility to land claims by First Nations people, and demonstrated contempt for their concerns. In a letter to his mother, Charlotte, regarding the Indians of the Oregon Territory he wrote, \"I think they are the ugliest and laziest creatures I ever saw and we should as soon think of being afraid of our dogs as of them.\" (23 June 1850, Joseph Trutch Papers, UBCL, folder A1.b.) And in a letter to the Secretary of State, \"I have not yet met with a single Indian whom I consider to have attained even the most glimmering perception of the Christian creed.\" (26 September 1871, BC Papers Connected with the Indian Land, p. 101) In 1867 Trutch refused to recognize the legitimacy of the reserves established by former Lieutenant-Governor James Douglas and had them re-surveyed, reducing their size by 91%.\n\nHis memorandum of 1870 denied the existence of aboriginal title, setting the stage for the colonial assembly to prohibit aboriginal people from pre-empting unoccupied, unsurveyed, or unreserved land without special permission; this decision effectively established a maximum and denied natives the right to acquire lands held by non-natives (A Sto:lo-Coast Salish Historical Atlas, page 164). These policies have had lasting repercussions in modern British Columbia politics with respect to the ongoing process of resolving native land claims.\n\nIn 1870, Trutch's brother John married the sister of the colonial governor Anthony Musgrave. Trutch and Musgrave became close. Following the establishment of the Canadian Confederation in 1867 they worked together to negotiate British Columbia's entry, which occurred in 1871 after they secured a promise for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).\n\nTrutch was the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia following Confederation, a position he retained from 1871–1876. Following his tenure as lieutenant governor, Trutch was appointed a \"Dominion agent for British Columbia\", and helped to oversee the construction of the CPR in the province.\n\nHe left this office in 1890 and returned to England. He died there in 1904 in Somerset, the county of his birth.\n\nThe locality of Trutch, British Columbia () along the Alaska Highway, is named after Joseph. The location is now a ghost town. Trutch Streets in Vancouver and Victoria are named after him.\n"}

The venue is managed by Stadium Management South Africa (SMSA) and is a home of Kaizer Chiefs F.C. in the South African Premier Soccer League as well as key fixtures for the South African national football team.\n\nIt is located next to the South African Football Association headquarters (\"SAFA House\") where both the FIFA offices and the Local Organising Committee for the 2010 FIFA World Cup were housed. Designed as the main association football stadium for the World Cup, the FNB Stadium became the largest stadium in Africa with a capacity of 94,736. However, its maximum capacity during the 2010 FIFA World Cup was 84,490 due to reserved seating for the press and other VIPs. The stadium is also known by its nickname \"The Calabash\" due to its resemblance to the African pot or gourd.\n\nIt was the site of Nelson Mandela's first speech in Johannesburg after his release from prison in 1990, and served as the venue for a memorial service to him on 10 December 2013. It was also the site of Chris Hani's funeral. It was also the venue for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final, which was played by the Netherlands and Spain. The World Cup closing ceremony on the day of the final saw the final public appearance of Mandela.\n\nThe stadium has been officially known as FNB Stadium since it was opened in 1989. This was due to a naming rights deal with First National Bank. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as in the month before the tournament, the stadium was referred to as Soccer City. This was done as FIFA does not allow stadiums to be referred to by sponsored names during FIFA-sanctioned tournaments. The stadium's current name is FNB Stadium.\n\nBuilt in 1987, the stadium underwent a major upgrade for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with a new design inspired by the shape of an African pot, the calabash. The South African main contractor GLTA, part of the Aveng Group in a joint venture with the Dutch company BAM who had a 25% stake, constructed the upgrade, which was designed by HOK Sport (now known as Populous) and Boogertman + Partners. The upgrade included: an extended upper tier around the stadium to increase the capacity to 88,958, an additional 2 executive suites, an encircling roof, new changing room facilities and new floodlights. The number of suites in the stadium was increased to 195. Grinaker-LTA and BAM international won the R1.5 billion tender to upgrade the stadium. The construction was completed on Wednesday, 21 October 2009 and was marked by a huge celebration at the stadium.\n\nThe outside of the stadium is designed to have the appearance of an African pot; the cladding on the outside is a mosaic of fire and earthen colours with a ring of lights running around the bottom of the structure, simulating fire underneath the pot. No spectator is seated more than 100 metres (330 ft) from the field, and there are no restricted views in the stadium.\n\nThe stands in the FNB Stadium are articulated by ten black vertical lines; nine are aligned geographically with the nine other stadiums involved in the 2010 World Cup. Because 9 is considered to be an unlucky number in South African traditional culture, a tenth line was added. This tenth line is aimed at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, which hosted the previous World Cup final in 2006. This represents the road to the final and it is hoped that after the World Cup, each goal scored at the stadium will be placed in pre-cast concrete panels on a podium so that the full history of the tournament's scores can be seen for years to come.\n\nBefore the upgrade, the stadium had a capacity of 40,000. The newly reconstructed stadium retains part of the original structure's west upper tier, although this and the entire lower tier were rebuilt to improve sightlines. The lower tier was completely reconstructed and divided into two segments which enabled the creation of a new lower concourse (the lower embankment concourse) linked to the existing ground level concourse.\n\nFNB Stadium served as the main venue for the tournament.

It was seen as the de facto national stadium for Bafana Bafana after re-admission in 1992, who played their third ever international match there on 11 July 1992 where they drew 2-2 with Cameroon courtesy of goals from Phil and Bennett Masinga for South Africa in front of 65,000 supporters. The \"old\" FNB Stadium also housed the then South African Football Association (SAFA) headquarters as well as the offices of the semi-professional National Soccer League (which later traded as the professional Premier Soccer League).\nThe stadium has also hosted large continental club fixtures. It is largely remembered as the venue where Bafana Bafana lifted the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations when they beat Tunisia 2-0 in front of a full capacity in a match witnessed by then South African president, Nelson Mandela, his then deputy president and former South African State President, FW de Klerk, as well as Zulu monarch, King Zwelithini.

The stadium has also hosted the CAF Super Cup twice. It hosted the 1994 CAF Super Cup, between Zamalek and Al-Ahly, as well as the 1996 CAF Super Cup between Orlando Pirates and JS Kabylie. In 2004, the stadium hosted final of the Vodacom Challenge, between AS Vita Club and Kaizer Chiefs.\n\nSome of the most memorable Bafana Bafana matches at the venue include the narrow 3-2 defeat to Brazil in 1996 as well as the country's memorable triumph when they secured passage through to a first ever World Cup appearance for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France when they beat Republic of Congo 1-0 through a Phil Masinga strike in 1997.\n\nDuring the 2010 FIFA World Cup, one of the most entertaining matches was played here in the quarterfinal stages when Uruguay beat Ghana in a penalty shootout made more memorable by a blatant handball in the last minute of the extra time by Uruguay striker Luis Suárez, which denied a Ghana and Africa a first ever semifinal appearance at the world soccer showpiece.\n\nThe FNB Stadium is home to Kaizer Chiefs Football Club. It is also the preferred venue for the Soweto derby football matches - the country's biggest sporting showpiece - involving Soweto based Premier Soccer League clubs, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. It was also the traditional home of the Iwisa Maize Meal Spectacular and later, the Telkom Charity Cup, which were charity soccer season openers in South African football from 1990 to 2006, before it was closed for renovations. The Charity Cup then returned in 2010. The stadium was re-opened when it hosted the 2010 Nedbank Cup final between Bidvest Wits and Amazulu. The game ended, 3–0, to Bidvest Wits. Fabricio Rodrigues was the first player to score at the \"new\" Soccer City. The first league match at the stadium since being rebuilt, was a 2010–11 Premier Soccer League match between Orlando Pirates and Free State Stars. The first MTN 8 match at the stadium was the first leg of the 2010 MTN 8 semifinal, between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. The venue has also hosted high-profile Bafana Bafana matches, including the South African national football team's 1-0 win over Spain in 2013 as well as the side's worst ever defeat when they lost 5-0 to Brazil in another international friendly in 2014. \n\nIn May 2018, Mamelodi Sundowns hosted FC Barcelona in an exhibition match, dedicated to the late Former President of South Africa in his centenary. The match ended 3-1 in the favour of Barcelona.\n\nFNB stadium is a multi-purpose venue and hosted its first rugby union match in 2010, the Tri Nations match between South Africa and New Zealand, won by the latter. The attendance was 94,713 which is listed as the third highest rugby attendance ever in the Southern Hemisphere and a record attendance for the redeveloped stadium, until it was eclipsed on 1 August 2015, when 94,807 was recorded when Orlando Pirates played Kaizer Chiefs in the Carling Black Label Cup fixture. The stadium hosted New Zealand again in the 2012 Rugby Championship on 6 October, with the All Blacks defeating the Springboks 32-16 in front of 88,739. In 2013, the Springboks defeated Argentina 73–13 at FNB Stadium in front of a crowd 52,867.

It was often interpreted as a campaign for socially conservative causes such as promoting the traditional family, though Major denied this. The campaign became the subject of ridicule when a succession of Conservative politicians were caught up in scandals.\n\nThe previous year of Major's premiership had been beset by infighting within the Conservative party on the issue of Europe, including rebellions in several Parliamentary votes on the Maastricht Treaty. He was also dealing with the fallout from the Black Wednesday economic debacle of September 1992.\n\nMajor's speech, delivered on 8 October 1993, began by noting the disagreements over Europe: \n\nMajor then changed the subject to \"a world that sometimes seems to be changing too fast for comfort\". He attacked many of the changes in Britain since the Second World War, singling out developments in housing, education, and criminal justice. He then continued: \n\nHe mentioned the phrase once again near the conclusion of his speech: \n\nDuring 1993, Britain was going through what has been characterised as a moral panic on the issue of single mothers. Government ministers regularly made speeches on the issue, such as John Redwood's condemnation of \"young women [who] have babies with no apparent intention of even trying marriage or a stable relationship with the father of the child\" from July 1993, and Peter Lilley's characterisation of single mothers as \"benefit-driven\" and \"undeserving\" from the same year. The murder of James Bulger earlier in 1993, by two young boys from single-parent families, served to intensify the media frenzy.\n\nApart from some generic platitudes about families and self-reliance, Major's speech said nothing specific about sexual behaviour or single motherhood. On 6 January 1994, Major explicitly stated that the campaign was not \"a crusade about personal morality\". Despite this, the \"Back to Basics\" campaign was widely interpreted by the media as including a \"family values\" component.\n\nAccording to Debbie Epstein and Richard Johnson: \n\nWriting in his diary shortly after and in reference to the Michael Brown story (Brown being a government whip who resigned in 1994 in the wake of newspaper revelations that he had taken a trip to Barbados with a 20-year-old man), Piers Morgan, who exposed many of the sexual scandals as editor of the \"News of the World\", opined: \n\nThe following scandals were linked to the \"Back To Basics\" campaign in the media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Major lost the 1997 general election and resigned as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader. Several years later, it was revealed that he had conducted a four-year-long extra-marital affair with fellow Conservative MP Edwina Currie in the 1980s. The liaison occurred when both were backbenchers, and had ended well before Major became Prime Minister. Currie disclosed the romance in her diaries, published in 2002, adding that she considered the \"Back to Basics\" campaign to have been \"absolute humbug\".\n\nIn 2017, Major said the slogan was an example of how sound bites can mislead the public, saying \"[I]t was taken up to pervert a thoroughly worthwhile social policy and persuaded people it was about something quite different.\"\n\nThe phrase has since become used by UK political commentators to describe any failed attempt by a political party leader to relaunch themselves following a scandal or controversy. The phrase was satirised in the \"Viz\" strip Baxter Basics.\n\n"}

Tracing its history back to 1923 and being incorporated by royal charter in 1941, the Australian Red Cross Society is the Australian National Society of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The Australian Red Cross is guided by the Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and as such is a secular, neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organisation.\n\nThe Australian Red Cross provides a range of services and programmes including international aid across the Asia-Pacific region, international humanitarian law advocacy, migration support, emergency management, blood donation via the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, and community services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, youth, families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.\n\nHis Excellency General The Honourable David Hurley , Governor-General of Australia, is the Patron of the Australian Red Cross Society and a non-voting member of the National Council. The National Council is the peak governance decision-making body and is made up of 53 voting members including the President and the National Board. The National Council delegates operational and management decisions and other responsibilities to the National Board and the CEO.\n\nIn 2013, the Australian Red Cross was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards.\n\nA branch of the British Red Cross was established in Australia in 1914, nine days after the start of World War I, by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson. The British Red Cross Australian Branch changed its name to the Australian Red Cross Society and was incorporated by royal charter on 28 June 1941.\n\nThe organisation grew at a rapid rate. Lady Helen wrote to the mayors of every shire and municipality in Australia asking them to initiate a local branch. Typically, a letter was published in the local newspaper and a meeting called. By November 1914, New South Wales had 88 city or suburban branches and 249 country branches, all established within the previous four months. The Society was accepted by the community from the beginning. Much of the World War I home front activities such as knitting socks and rolling bandages was done by local Red Cross branches. The Red Cross Information Bureau was established in 1915 in order to coordinate information gathered on the dead and their burial beyond what was provided by the armed forces. The Red Cross Wounded and Missing files were extensive with searchers sometimes sent overseas to clarify information, make better judgements and to resolve conflicting accounts. In 1916 the Australian Red Cross Society sent a team of 21 civilian nurses to France; these nurses were dubbed the \"Bluebirds\" in reference to the colours of their specially-designed uniforms.\n\nDuring World War II the Red Cross provided assistance to the sick, wounded, maimed and their dependents. By agreement with the federal government they provided hostel accommodation to those with no living relatives or friends to support them upon returning home from war. At the time the majority of the volunteers were unemployed married women. High rates of membership in the organisation were attributed to their annual, national, recruitment drive. Membership grew from 260,000 in 1941 to 450,000 in 1944. The Australian Red Cross proved to be an important link between the public and Japanese prisoners of war.\n\nFrom the establishment of the Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic at 310 St Kilda Rd, Southbank, in 1937 the Red Cross maintained the canteen staffed by up to 25 volunteers. The canteen provided tea, coffee, biscuits and company for between 200 and 250 veterans each day waiting their appointments.\n\nIn 2005, the organisation made an agreement with the Maldives Government to help clear debris created by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In December 2010, aid workers from the Australian Red Cross were sent to Christmas Island to assist the survivors of the 2010 Christmas Island boat disaster. Australian Red Cross volunteers were also active after Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin, the Ash Wednesday bushfires, the Black Saturday bushfires and the 2010–11 Queensland floods.\n\nThe passion and commitment of the volunteers is widely acknowledged. They rise to natural disaster or personal crisis from bushfire to flood or drought. Today there are more than 60,000 trained volunteers and the entire Australian Red Cross program is funded by public donations and corporate partnerships.\n\nThe eight priority areas of Red Cross in Australia are:\n\n\n"}

The strength of the shaking involved in strong ground motion usually overwhelms a seismometer, forcing the use of accelerographs (or strong ground motion accelerometers) for recording. The science of strong ground motion also deals with the variations of fault rupture, both in total displacement, energy released, and rupture velocity.\n\nAs seismic instruments (and accelerometers in particular) become more common, it becomes necessary to correlate expected damage with instrument-readings. The old Modified Mercalli intensity scale (MM), a relic of the pre-instrument days, remains useful in the sense that each intensity-level provides an observable difference in seismic damage.\n\nAfter many years of trying every possible manipulation of accelerometer-time histories, it turns out that the extremely simple peak ground velocity (PGV) provides the best correlation with damage. PGV merely expresses the peak of the first integration of the acceleration record. Accepted formulae now link PGV with MM Intensity. Note that the effect of soft soils gets built into the process, since one can expect that these foundation conditions will amplify the PGV significantly.\n\n\"ShakeMaps\" are produced by the United States Geological Survey, provide almost-real-time information about significant earthquake events, and can assist disaster-relief teams and other agencies.\n\n\nSources\n"}
{"id": "1815418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815418", "title": "Super CCD", "text": "Super CCD\n\nSuper CCD is a proprietary charge-coupled device that has been developed by Fujifilm since 1999. The Super CCD uses octagonal, rather than rectangular, pixels. This allows a higher horizontal and vertical resolution (at the expense of diagonal resolution) to be achieved than a traditional sensor of an equivalent pixel count.\n\nOn January 21, 2003 Fujifilm announced the fourth generation of SuperCCD sensors, in two variations: SuperCCD HR and SuperCCD SR. HR stands for \"high resolution\" and SR stands for \"super dynamic range\". The SR sensor has two photodiodes per photosite, one much larger than the other. Appropriately processing information from both can yield larger black to white range of brightness (dynamic range).\nThe 4th Generation Super CCD HR has sensors placed at 45 degrees to the horizontal. In order to convert the images into the normal horizontal/vertical pixel orientation, it interpolates one pixel between each pair of sensors, thereby producing 12 recorded megapixels from 6 effective megapixels. By contrast, Fujifilm says that 5th Generation Super CCD HR sensors are also at 45 degrees but do not interpolate. However, it omits to explain how the sensors turn the image into horizontal/vertical pixels without interpolating.\n\nOn July 29, 2005 Fujifilm announced cameras with \"5th Generation Super CCD HR sensors\", the FinePix S5200 (S5600) and FinePix S9000 (S9500). The FinePix F10 and F11 were released later in 2005.\n\nIn 2006 Fuji introduced the 6th generation of the Super CCD sensor (size 1/1.7\", 6.3 million effective pixels, except for the F40fd which has size 1/1.6\", 8.3 million effective pixels). This sensor allows for acceptable image quality even at ISO 800. It is built into the FinePix S6500fd (2006) bridge camera and the FinePix F-series F30, F20 (2006), F31fd and F40fd (2007) compact cameras, all of which are widely accredited for their class leading low-light capabilities.\n\nIn late 2007 the 7th generation was introduced (size 1/1.6\", 12 million effective pixels). Included in Fuijfilm FinePix F50fd (2007). This sensor, although sharp, has significantly decreased ISO performance compared to earlier generations, dropping in quality to average level. When compared to the 6th generation sensor, the individual pixel area on the 7th generation sensor is approximately 1.7× lower, considerably reducing the amount of light reaching each pixel. In mid-2008 the 8th generation was introduced (same size 1/1.6\", 12 million effective pixels), included in Fujifilm FinePix F100fd (2008). This sensor improves slightly on the previously lost ISO performance, but does still not seem to compare with the 6th generation sensors.\n\nIn September 2008 Fujifilm announced a new type of Super CCD sensor, the Super CCD EXR. This sensor aims at combining the advantages of the HR and SR sensor types in a single chip. It uses a new color filter array layout that allows for binning (combining) of pixels of the same color. Currently (Apr. 2010) this sensor is used in the F200EXR, F70EXR and F80EXR point-and-shoot cameras and the S200EXR bridge camera. Both the F200EXR and the S200EXR use the same 12 Megapixel 1/1.6\" size sensor while the F70EXR and F80EXR use a 10 Megapixel and 12 Megapixel 1/2\" sensor respectively.\n\nIn 2010, Fujifilm made its last cameras with the Super CCD sensor in the form of the F300EXR and the Z800EXR. Both use the same 1/2\" 12 Megapixel SuperCCD EXR sensor with hybrid autofocus system. The camera uses the conventional contrast detection AF and also Phase detection AF by means of dedicated pixels to calculate focus. According to Fujifilm, this system was as fast or faster than a DSLR. In 2011, Fujifilm have decided to use Backside illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors with conventional square photosited Bayer color pattern array as well as Fujifilm's EXR color filter array that used square photosites that were rotated 45 degrees. This marked the end of the SuperCCD production.\n\n"}

This is the standard modern meaning of solifluction, which differs from the original meaning given to it by Johan Gunnar Andersson in 1906.\n\nIn the original sense it meant the movement of waste saturated in water found in periglacial regions. However it was later discovered that various slow waste movements in periglacial regions did not require saturation in water, but were rather associated to freeze-thaw processes. The term solifluction was appropriated to refer to these slow processes, and therefore excludes rapid periglacial movements. In slow periglacial solifluction there are not clear gliding planes, and therefore skinflows and active layer detachments are not included in the concept. On the other hand, movement of waste saturated in water can occur in any humid climate, and therefore this kind of solifluction is not restricted to cold climates.\n\nSlow periglacial solifluction is classified into four types:\nSlow solifluction acts much slower than some geochemical fluxes or than other erosion processes. The relatively low rates at which solifluction operates contrast with its occurrence over wide mountain areas and periglaciated lowlands. Since solifluction is associated with humidity and cold climates it can be used to infer past climates.\n\nDeposits of slow periglacial solifluction compromise poorly stratified diamicton and diamicton where stratification is wholly lacking. When stratification can be seen it is often distinguished by a buried organic soil. Some other solifluction deposits that have a more defined stratification consist of alternating layers of diamicton and open-work beds, these last representing buried stone-banked lobes and sheets. A common feature in solifluction deposits is the orientation of clasts parallel to the slope.\n\nSolifluction lobes and sheets are types of slope failure and landforms. In solifluction lobes sediments form a tongue-shaped feature due to differential downhill flow rates. In contrast, solifluction sheet sediments move more or less uniformly downslope, thus being a less selective form of erosion than solifluction lobes.\n\nIt has been suggested that solifluction might be active on Mars, even relatively recently (within the last few million years), as observed Martian lobates bear many similarities with solifluction lobes known from Svalbard.\n\n\n"}

Aycock was a member of the PGA of America for 68 years and served as the Carolinas Section President for more than 15 years and as National Vice President (now known as District Director).\n\nAycock was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1938, Aycock designed the Lexington Country Club and was its head professional there for 38 of the next 40 years.\n\nDuring World War II, Aycock was the special services director of his Army unit. He smuggled golf equipment into Italy and North Africa in a shipment of kitchen fixtures, helped rebuild golf courses there, and even organized an Army tournament. Among the players who participated were Tommy Bolt and Bobby Locke.\n\nTo raise money for the March of Dimes campaign against polio in 1947, Aycock came up with the idea of playing golf cross-country from Lexington, North Carolina to the ninth hole at Thomasville Golf Course; a distance of about 10 miles (16 km). Donors were asked to contribute and guess how many strokes it would take Aycock to complete the \"hole\". He teed off from a square in downtown Lexington and was allowed to tee the ball up on every shot except those that found water or ditches. He had to take penalty shots on those. It took Aycock a total of 114 strokes to go the entire 10 miles. Prior to starting, he wrote on a piece of paper sealed in an envelope that he thought it would take him 115 strokes. The event raised more than $5,000.\n\nIn 1957, Aycock was named national PGA Golf Professional of the Year. He was inducted into the Carolinas PGA Hall of Fame in 1981, the Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame in 1982, and the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1969. In addition to serving several terms as the PGA's vice president, he was a member of its executive committee, served on the PGA's Ryder Cup committee, and officiated at the Matches on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Davidson County Amateur Champion is named in his honor.\n"}

The first Peace Picnic was organised by the late Mr J. C. Chrystie to celebrate the end of the 1914 - 1918 war. This day came to be celebrated throughout the following years and to be looked upon as a local holiday for the fishermen of the town and all connected with their calling.\n\nDuring the preliminary arrangements for the 1939 Picnic, the committee felt that the crowning of a Queen would not only be of interest to the young folk of the town but would prove to be a ceremony in which they could symbolise, in many ways, the ideals as well as the everyday things associated with the life of a fishing community.\n\nThe modern way of life brought about many changes since the days of Mr Chrystie but the symbolism is still the same: the children still enjoy their picnic and the Queen is still crowned. For a long period up to 2001, the Herring Queen was selected by popular vote in the local High School but this changed to a process whereby a panel of local townspeople make the selection after nominees were interviewed.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for satirical figurative paintings which deal with provocative sexual and social themes in a technically skillful manner. His work shows a wide range of influences, including sources as diverse as the Renaissance, popular culture magazines, and contemporary fashion models. He often distorts or exaggerates the erotic forms of the female body, and has stressed that his characters are reflections of himself rather than inspired by real people. \"\"His technical skills\"\", Calvin Tomkins has written, \"\"which include elements of Old Master paint application and high-Mannerist composition, have been put to use on some of the most seductive and rivetingly weird figure paintings of our era.\"\"\n\nCurrin was born in Boulder, Colorado, and grew up in Connecticut, the son of a physics professor from Connecticut and a piano teacher from Oklahoma. In Connecticut as a teenager he studied painting privately with a renowned and traditionally trained Russian artist from Odessa, Ukraine, Lev Meshberg. He went to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he obtained a BFA in 1984, and received a MFA from Yale University in 1986.\n\nAt White Columns in New York City in 1989 he exhibited a series of portraits of young girls derived from the photographs in a high school yearbook, and initiated his efforts to distill art from traditionally clichéd subjects. In the 1990s, when political themed art works were favored, Currin brazenly used bold depictions of busty young women, mustachioed men and asexual divorcés, setting him apart from the rest. He used magazines like \"Cosmopolitan\" along with old issues of \"Playboy\" for inspiration for his paintings. In 1992 Currin moved to the Andrea Rosen Gallery, focusing, less sympathetically, on well-to-do middle-aged women. Nonetheless, by the late 1990s Currin's ability to paint subjects of kitsch with technical facility met with critical and financial success, and by 2003 his paintings were selling \"for prices in the high six figures\" after he moved to the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea. More recently, he has undertaken a series of figure paintings dealing with unabashedly pornographic themes, saying \"\"One motive of mine is to see if I could make this clearly debased and unbeautiful thing become beautiful in a painting\"\".\n\nHe has had retrospective exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and is represented in the permanent collections of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the Tate Gallery. Currin's Whitney retrospective of 2004 showcased the development of his career through over 40 of his displayed paintings.\n\nIn 1994 Currin met artist Rachel Feinstein at a gallery in which she was living in a self-made gingerbread house as a performance piece. However, Feinstein specializes in sculptural work. They were engaged two weeks later at Currin's show in Paris, and married three years later on Valentine's Day. They have two sons and a daughter. She has been described as his muse, which he says is \"\"kinda corny\"\". However, he has stated \"\"[W]hen I met Rachel I felt that I could connect with some principles that moved my art along, that I had some freedom from the petty things in my own personality.\"\" Feinstein has appeared in many of Currin's paintings, both as a recognizable face and as a body model. In 2002 Feinstein and Currin published a 24-page book of their works at the Hydra Workshop in Hydra, Greece which they titled \"The Honeymooners, John Currin and Rachel Feinstein\". It includes an interview conducted by Sadie Coles. In 2011 the \"New York Times\" described them as \"the ruling power couple in today’s art world.\n\nIn a 2011 interview, Currin described his relationship to his work as, \"...a completely ambisexual atmosphere. I think you're right if there's a reverse logic to my work It's that the pictures of men are about men and the pictures of women are about me.\nAs of 2015, he is represented by the Gagosian Gallery, in both New York and Paris, displaying his scrutiny and emulation of 16th century Northern European paintings. His inspirations come from Old Master portraits and pin-ups, nymphs, and ethereal feminine prototypes, as well as his muse and wife, Feinstein. His paintings hold conversation between the grotesque and the beautiful, and range inspiration from classical artists such as Fragonard and Bouchard to Rockwell and Crumb \n\nCurrin's painting, \"Bea Arthur Naked\", sold at Christie's on May 15, 2013 for .\n\nCurrin has cited Danish pornography \"\"pulled... off the Internet\"\" as source material for his work.

In the 1930s, the area was affected by both the great depression and a huge drought affecting most of Western Canada. Many of Hepburn's residents and farmers flocked to cities like Saskatoon and even to the United States. By the end of the decade, the population was less than 300.\n\nIn the 1940s, the community sent over 60 men to serve in World War II. After the war, Hepburn started to grow, and new homes were built. In 1989, the province shut down the railroad line, stranding three grain elevators. Like most Saskatchewan grain elevators, two were torn down but one remained, being converted into a museum about the history of Hepburn and of saskatchwan .\n\nHepburn today is at 562 residents and is trying to expand itself. In 2000, it developed some old railroad land into a new subdivision. Only 8 lots were made and 3 were sold. Hepburn residents also enjoy the local bowling alley.

The genus occurs only in northern Brazil and is found at rocky places, under shrubs, which support their frail stalk. They are subtropical plants, with very little frost tolerance.\nThe species often have frail stalks that can be upright or procumbent, reaching 2 m high and about 2 to 5 cm thick. There are from 10 to 15 ribs, and ramifications are rare, and usually occur from the base.\n\nThe flowers are nocturnal and tube-like, measuring 1 to 3 cm in length and 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. Flower colors can be pink or carmine. The fruit is berry-like, spherical with a maximal diameter of 1.5 cm, and pink or red when ripe.\n\nThese tropical cacti are ideal for hanging baskets because of their snake like growth, but they are difficult to cultivate. They grow relatively rapidly in good conditions. Propagation is done more by seed than by cuttings. It grows best on slightly humid soil and with plenty of watering from spring to autumn.

The 2nd Battalion was raised at Quetta in 1907 by Major N G Woodyatt, the Right Wing becoming the 1st Battalion and the Left Wing becoming the 2nd Battalion 7th Gurkha Rifles.\n\nThe regiment had the distinction of being one of only two out of the ten Gurkha regiments to recruit its soldiers from the towns and villages which lie along the rugged foothills of the Himalayas east of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Gurkha officers and soldiers have come predominantly from the Rai and Limbu clans but the roll records many names from the less numerous Sunwar, Tamang and Eastern Gurung clans, men from the Sherpa families of mountaineering fame and a sprinkling from Western Nepal and India as well.\n\n\nThe Regiment's first home base was designated as Quetta in northwest India, now Pakistan. It was from here that the 2nd Battalion (2/7 GR) deployed at the start of the First World War to join British forces which were to fight against the Turkish Empire in the Middle East. The Battalion's first campaign in Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq, was ill-fated. In spite of early successes, such as the battles at Nasiriyah and Ctesiphon, it was part of the force which became trapped at Kut-al-Amara on the River Tigris. After a long siege the garrison, exhausted by a lack of food and ammunition, was forced to surrender to the Turkish Army and went into captivity in 1916. However, in the following year a new 2nd Battalion was raised and the 1st Battalion which had now arrived from Nepal joined it in a reinvigorated and victorious campaign which swept the Turks out of Mesopotamia.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the 1st Battalion saw service in the brief Kurdistan campaign, while the 2nd Battalion returned to India to fight in the Third Afghan War, alongside the 3rd Battalion raised for war service in 1917. Thereafter, the two regular battalions spent the inter-war years on occasional tours of duty on the northwest frontier of India and on internal security tasks elsewhere on the sub continent. The 2nd Battalion played a notable part in rescue operations following the disastrous earthquake which destroyed much of Quetta in 1935.\n\nAt the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, both Battalions were based alongside each other at Shillong in the Indian province of Assam. 2nd Battalion was mobilized for overseas operations in 1941, returning to Iraq to participate in the campaign to secure oil supplies for the Allies and then to defeat Vichy French forces in Syria. It then redeployed to join the 8th Army in North Africa where it had the misfortune to be captured at Tobruk in 1942 along with the rest of the garrison. In the meantime the 1st Battalion together with a hastily raised 3rd Battalion had joined British forces fighting a Japanese army which had invaded Burma. Despite heavy casualties during the retreat to India both battalions survived the ordeal. 1/7 GR re-armed and retrained, then took part in the great defensive battle at Imphal in 1944 which broke the Japanese advance. The gallantry displayed by a young rifleman, Ganju Lama, during a subsequent action near Bishenpur was recognised by the award of the Victoria Cross. The 1st Battalion then took part in the great campaign waged by 14th Army under the command of General Sir William Slim, who as a Lt Colonel had earlier commanded the 2nd Battalion in India, to re-conquer Burma and played the foremost part in the capture of Meiktila. The 3rd Battalion which had been redesigned as a parachute unit took part in the airborne assault to liberate Rangoon. As these events unfolded in the south east Asia, a new 2nd Battalion was again created in time to rejoin 8th Army in Italy. It took part in the monumental battle at Monte Cassino and was one of the very few battalions ever to earn a Battle Honour on its own, 'Tavoleto' for seizing the hilltop town of that name in the Marche. The Battalion completed its wartime service in Greece as part of the British force sent to stabilise the country following the end of German occupation.\n\nFor the 7th Gurkhas the coming of world peace was a time to disband both the 3rd Battalion and the 4th Battalion, raised in 1941 for frontier protection and internal security. The years after 1945 saw all Gurkha regiments preoccupied with the issue of Indian independence and the conditions of near civil war attendant on the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan. By an agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal and the British and Indian governments, four Gurkha regiments including the 7th Gurkhas were transferred to British Army service on 1 January 1948 in which they were to form the British Brigade of Gurkhas. However, a significant number of its manpower chose not to follow the regiment into British service; the 3rd Battalion was transferred to the 5th Gurkha Rifles, while a large number of men formed the nucleus of the new 11th Gurkha Rifles, now both regiments of the Indian Army. The Regiment moved almost immediately to Malaya which was to be the main Gurkha base for the next 25 years.\n\nThere, in 1948 as part of a plan to create an all-arms Gurkha division, the two battalions began training to become field artillery regiments, forming the 101st and 102nd Field Regiments, Royal Artillery. They stayed in the artillery role for only a year, before reverting to infantry in 1949. The experiment was short-lived because almost at once the Regiment was committed to the campaign against communist insurgents which came to be known as the Malayan Emergency and reverted to its infantry role. For some twelve years the two Battalions conducted jungle operations against an often elusive foe. The 2nd Battalion enjoyed a tour of duty as part of Britain's Hong Kong garrison from 1955-57. The campaign has been judged by posterity to have been a great success. Although no Battle Honour was awarded, the approval of a Royal title for the Regiment in 1959 in honour of the Duke of Edinburgh was a signal recognition of its outstanding operational record in Malaya and an acknowledgement of its distinguished service in the two world wars. From now on the Regiment was to be styled, '7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles'.\n\nIn 1962 the 1st Battalion was dispatched from Malaya to the nearby state of Brunei in north Borneo to assist the British Army in suppressing a revolt by Indonesian backed rebels against the Sultan, an ally of the United Kingdom. A short time later they were joined by the 2nd Battalion and each conducted successful operations resulting in the capture of some of the key leaders of the rebellion. Operations in Brunei prompted recognition of the need for a parachute force to be available in the Far East and the Regiment contributed the majority of the complement which established the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company in 1963. The Brunei Revolt was a prelude to a war between an expansionist Indonesia and the new Malaysian Federation backed by Britain and the Commonwealth which is known as the Borneo Confrontation. Fought largely in the mountains and swamps of Sabah and Sarawak and without much publicity it lasted from 1963 to 1966. Both Battalions of 7 GR were heavily involved in the campaign in which the reputation of Gurkhas as supremely able jungle soldiers was enhanced.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of the campaign and the establishment of political stability in that corner of south east Asia presaged a re evaluation of Britain's role in the Far East. Although the Regiment was increasingly involved in maintaining the security of the Crown Colony of Hong Kong, particularly when stability there was affected by the Chinese Cultural revolution in 1967, the strength of Brigade was to be substantially reduced. On 31 July 1970 the two Battalions amalgamated into one. The new Battalion moved to the United Kingdom in 1971 to Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Church Crookham near Fleet in Hampshire. On this first tour the Regiment had the great honour of being the first Gurkha regiment to mount the guard at Buckingham Palace. Thereafter, 7 GR proceeded on a cycle of duty tours alternating between the United Kingdom, Brunei and Hong Kong, taking part in training exercises around the world, maintaining its jungle skills and providing internal and border security in Hong Kong. In 1981 the 2nd Battalion was re-raised to assist the Hong Kong government cope with the surge in immigration from China. The 2nd Battalion was disbanded in 1986 when the crisis had passed.\n\nThe routine of peacetime was briefly broken in 1982 when 1st/7th Gurkhas, then based in the United Kingdom, deployed with 5th Infantry Brigade as part of the task force which successfully recaptured the Falkland Islands following the Argentine invasion, its primary action being at Mount William thereby earning its final Battle Honour. The Battalion was once again in the United Kingdom from 1991 for what would be its final years, until it was amalgamated in 1994 with the 2nd Battalion 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles), 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles and 10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles to form the Royal Gurkha Rifles.\n\nAt a final parade at Church Crookham on 26 May 1994 attended by Duke of Edinburgh and many old comrades from Britain and Nepal, the Regiment marched off into history.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Tropics British Army officers invariably wore white mess kit jackets when appropriate. Officers of 7th Gurkha Rifles however, always wore dark jackets. This was because the regiment went into mourning for the loss of Lord Kitchener, (see above) Secretary of State for War, on 5 June 1916, when HMS Hampshire struck a mine and sank. Lord Kitchener was travelling to Russia. It appears that the order for officers to wear dark jackets with tropical mess kit was never rescinded.\n\n7th Gurkha Rifles had a unique stance for 'Regimental Stand Easy' - this entailed holding the barrel of the rifle in the left hand, whereas throughout the remainder of the British Army and the Brigade of Gurkhas at 'Stand Easy', the rifle was held by the right hand - normally at or about the sights.\n\n\n'History of the 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles' by Colonel J N Mackay DSO - William Blackwood & Sons Ltd, Edinburgh and London, 1962.\n\n'East of Kathmandu' - The Story of the 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles Volume II 1948-1973' by Brigadier E D Smith CBE DSO - Leo Cooper, London, 1976.\n\n'The Autumn Years' - Volume III of the History of the 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles by Brigadier E D Smith CBE DSO - Spellmount, Staplehurst, 1997.\n\n'India's Army' by Major Donovan Jackson - London Marston Low, Marston & Co., Ltd.\n\n7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles Regimental Association.\n"}

{"id": "1815491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815491", "title": "Rare Bird", "text": "Rare Bird\n\nRare Bird were an English progressive rock band, formed in 1969. They had more success in other European countries. They released five studio albums between 1969 and 1974. In the UK, they never charted with an album but charted with one single, the organ-based track \"Sympathy\", which peaked at number 27. It sold one million copies globally.\n\nThe band's initial line-up was as below, although there would be changes by the time they came to work on their third album. The first two members listed were a constant throughout the lifetime of the band.\n\nThe history of Rare Bird began when Graham Field placed an advertisement for a pianist in a musical periodical. He got thirty replies and formed a group called \"Lunch\". He met Dave Kaffinetti in November 1968, and together they formulated the basic ideas for Rare Bird. In August 1969, they finally found the ideal rhythm section in Steve Gould, Chris Randall and Mark Ashton. Field and Kaffinetti had originally envisaged that the band would be a four-piece and were looking for a singer/bass player. Gould and Randall, who had both previously been members of the Pop-Psych band \"Fruit Machine\", applied to the advert as vocals/guitar and bass respectively and were taken on. Lunch played a few gigs; one notable one was at the Tilbury Working Mens Club for the princely sum of five pounds. The band had no van and they managed to get amps, drums, guitars and Hammond organ into their cars. The gig was marred by Randall receiving a bad electric shock whilst on stage. It later turned out that the founders of the band were more interested in Steve Gould and convinced him to play bass. Randall was now high and dry and was kicked out of the band. \n\nTwo weeks later, they had signed management and agency contracts, and three weeks later, were in the studio recording their debut album. Before joining Lunch, Randall and Gould had previously written a song called \"To the Memory of Two Brave Dogs\". Rare Bird included this song in their debut album, renaming it \"Iceberg\" but Randall received no credit on the L.P. Along with Van der Graaf Generator and The Nice, they were one of the very first bands that signed to Charisma Records, the record label that Tony Stratton-Smith had founded.\n\nTheir late 1969 release \"Sympathy\" reached No. 1 in Italy and in France, sold 500,000 copies in France and over one million globally. It became their only UK hit single, reaching No. 27 and staying on the chart for 8 weeks. A 1970 cover version of the track by The Family Dogg reached number two in the Netherlands. The song returned to the UK chart in 1992 when a version by Marillion reached No. 17. In 2001, the track was sampled by Faithless in their song \"Not Enuff Love\", named after a chorus line in \"Sympathy\". The first album released by \"Lunch\" in 1969 was called \"Rare Bird\", which now also became the band's new name.\n\nIn early 1971, Graham Field left Rare Bird to form a short-lived solo project, Fields.\n\nLater members included Fred Kelly (drums), Nic Potter (bass), Andy \"Ced\" Curtis (lead guitar, vocals), Paul Holland , and Paul Karas (bass, vocals) on the \"Epic Forest\" album with Andy Curtis and Fred Kelly appearing on the album \"Somebody's Watching\". The band finally split up in 1975.\n\nDave Kaffinetti (credited as David Kaff) played the part of Viv Savage in \"This Is Spinal Tap\" (1984). He also played keyboards for the band Spinal Tap in the film and on the soundtrack, and was seen in Spinal Tap's live appearances in 1984/85.\n\nChris Randall went on to play with Martin Murray and The Honeycombs, the group of the mid 1960s with their worldwide hits, \"Have I the Right\", \"Love In Tokyo\" and \"Thats the Way!\".\n\nPaul Holland had previously been a recording engineer at Southern Music's studio in Denmark Street, London during the time that Fruit Machine recorded songs for release on the Spark Label under the direction of Barry Kingston. He died of cancer in 2010.\n\nThe song \"Beautiful Scarlet\" from their first album was sampled in the 2004 song \"Summer's Gonna Hurt You\" by electronic music producer/DJ Diplo.\n\nAll compositions by Rare Bird.

The housing project is named after Frederick Douglass, African American abolitionist, author, and reformer.\n\nThe complex was home to such notable figures as Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, Lily Tomlin, Loni Love, and Etterlene DeBarge, during their early years. The claymation animated series \"The PJs\" was based on the housing project as well. It was also seen in a screenshots for the movie \"Dreamgirls\", as well as D12's debut music video. Brewster-Douglass is also mentioned in the first verse of singer/drag queen RuPaul's musical hit Supermodel (You Better Work).\n\nHastings Street was the center of black culture in Detroit between the 1920s and 1950s.. Located at the southern edge of the future Brewster-Douglass Homes, the street was the home of innumerable salons and entertainment venues. With the addition of the high-rises and an influx of people moving into the housing, Hastings Street was billed as the place you could fulfill any conceivable need. Hastings Street was most famously referenced in the John Lee Hooker song \"Boogie Chillen'\".\n\nThe I-75 corridor is now in place of this important African American landmark. The (Walter P.) Chrysler Freeway was constructed between 1963 and 1968.\n\nThe Brewster Project and Frederick Douglass Apartments were built between 1935 and 1955, and were designed by Harley, Ellington & Day of Detroit. The Brewster Project began construction in 1935, when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt broke ground for the 701-unit development; the first phase, consisting of low-rise apartment blocks, was completed in 1938. An expansion of the project completed in 1941 brought the total number of housing units to 941. The Frederick Douglass Apartments, built immediately to the south of the Brewster Project, began construction in 1942 with the completion of apartment rows, two 6-story low-rises, and finally six 14-story high rises completed between 1952 and 1955. The combined Brewster-Douglass Project was five city blocks long, and three city blocks wide, and housed anywhere between 8,000 and 10,000 residents, at its peak capacity.\n\nThe Brewster-Douglass Project were built for the \"working poor\"; the Detroit Housing Commission required an employed parent for each family before establishing tenancy. As the Commission became less selective, crime became a problem in the 1960s and 1970s, and the projects eventually fell into disrepair. The Frederick Douglass Apartment towers were converted to senior housing.\n\nIn 1991, the low-rise apartment blocks north of Wilkins Street (the original Brewster Project) were demolished, and by 1994 were replaced with 250 townhomes. This new public housing, administratively distinct from the Fredrick Douglass Homes project, was dubbed the \"Brewster Homes\", and still exists today.\n\nIn the meantime, the remaining housing on the project site continued to deteriorate. Two of the six 14-story Frederick Douglas Apartments towers, 303 and 304, were demolished in 2003, in an effort to consolidate living space and reduce maintenance costs. By 2008, only 280 families remained in the Frederick Douglass Homes complex, and the decision was made to shut down the housing entirely. The buildings south of Wilkins street were left abandoned after that date.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, 23-year-old French artist Bilal Berreni was found dead from a gunshot wound on the property of Brewster-Douglass, having last been seen the day before. Found without identification, Berreni's body was not identified for 7 months. Jasin Curtis and Drequone Rich each pled guilty to second degree murder and received 25-30 year prison sentences in 2015; Dionte Travis received a 60-year prison sentence in January 2016.\n\nDemolition of the remaining buildings of the Frederick Douglass Homes began on September 4, 2013. Demolition was substantially complete by the end of August, 2014.\n\nFrom historic marker on the site of Brewster Homes\n\nBetween 1910 and 1940 Detroit, Michigan's African American population increased dramatically. In 1935, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt broke ground for the Brewster Homes, the nation’s first federally funded public housing development for African Americans. The homes opened in 1938 with 701 units. When completed in 1941 there were 941 units bounded by Beaubien, Hastings, Mack and Wilkins Streets. Residents were required to be employed and there were limits on what they could earn. Former residents described Brewster as 'community filled with families that displayed love, respect and concern for everyone in a beautiful, clean and secure neighborhood.' The original Brewster Homes were demolished in 1991 and replaced by 250 townhouses.\n\nOn March 9, 2012, Mayor of Detroit Dave Bing announced that the Detroit Housing Commission planned to request funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to demolish all remaining housing on the Frederick Douglass Homes site, but redevelop the abandoned Brewster-Wheeler Recreation Center. The vacant land would then be developed as affordable housing and commercial space. The demolition was announced on November 15, 2012.\n\nThe six concrete-framed towers were designed in the Modern movement architectural style and faced in brick. They are virtually identical in look and each rise to the height of 15 floors.\n\nThe buildings were zoned to the following Detroit Public Schools facilities:\n\n\n"}

Gelifluction is prominent in periglacial regions where snow falls during six to eight months of the year. In spring, the snow and ice melt, and the landscape is effectively inundated with half a year's worth of rainfall in the space of a couple of days. The top soil becomes waterlogged, and flows like a liquid. Because the soil now a fluid, gelifluction is a form of mass movement that can occur on slopes with a slope angle of less than half a degree.\n\nThe most distinctive landforms created by gelifluction include gelifluction lobes and gelifluction benches. The former refer to tongue-shaped deposits of geliflucted material orientated downslope that tend to form on slopes of between 10° and 20°, whereas the latter refer to terrace-like deposits forming on gentler slopes with a long axis running parallel to the slope contour. Gelifluction lobes can be further subdivided into either stone-banked or turf-banked lobes depending on vegetation cover.\n\nA lobe is usually measured in terms of its front (riser) and its length upslope (tread); gelifluction lobes typically have risers of up to and treads of up to .\n"}

{"id": "1815532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815532", "title": "Finalizer", "text": "Finalizer\n\nIn computer science, a finalizer or finalize method is a special method that performs finalization, generally some form of cleanup. A finalizer is executed during object destruction, prior to the object being deallocated, and is complementary to an initializer, which is executed during object creation, following allocation. Finalizers are strongly discouraged by some, due to difficulty in proper use and the complexity they add, and alternatives are suggested instead, primarily the dispose pattern – see problems with finalizers.\n\nThe term \"finalizer\" is primarily used in object-oriented and functional languages that use garbage collection, of which the archetype is Smalltalk. This is contrasted with a \"destructor\", which is a method called for finalization in languages with deterministic object lifetimes, archetypically C++. These are generally exclusive – a language will have either finalizers (if automatically garbage collected) or destructors (if manually memory managed), but in rare cases a language may have both, as in C++/CLI and D, and in case of reference counting (instead of tracing garbage collection), terminology varies. In technical usage, \"finalizer\" may also be used to refer to destructors, as these also perform finalization, and some subtler distinctions are drawn – see terminology. The term \"final\" is also used to indicate a class that cannot be inherited; this is unrelated.\n\nThe terminology of \"finalizer\" and \"finalization\" versus \"destructor\" and \"destruction\" varies between authors and is sometimes unclear.\n\nIn common usage, a \"destructor\" is a method called deterministically on object destruction, and the archetype is C++ destructors; while a finalizer is called non-deterministically by the garbage collector, and the archetype is Java codice_1 methods.\n\nFor languages that implement garbage collection via reference counting, terminology varies, with some languages such as Objective-C and Perl using \"destructor\", and other languages such as Python using \"finalizer\" (per spec, Python is garbage collected, but the reference CPython implementation since its version 2.0 uses a combination of reference counting and garbage collection). This reflects the fact that reference counting results in semi-deterministic object lifetime: for objects that are not part of a cycle, objects are destroyed deterministically when the reference count drops to zero, but objects that are part of a cycle are destroyed non-deterministically, as part of a separate form of garbage collection.\n\nIn certain narrow technical usage, \"constructor\" and \"destructor\" are language-level terms, meaning \"methods defined in a class\", while \"initializer\" and \"finalizer\" are implementation-level terms, meaning \"methods called during object creation or destruction\". Thus for example the original specification for the C# language referred to \"destructors\", even though C# is garbage-collected, but the specification for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), and the implementation of its runtime environment as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), referred to \"finalizers\". This is reflected in the C# language committee's notes, which read in part: \"The C# compiler compiles destructors to ... [probably] instance finalizer[s]\". This terminology is confusing, and thus more recent versions of the C# spec refer to the language-level method as \"finalizers\".\n\nAnother language that does not make this terminology distinction is D. Although D classes are garbage collected, their cleanup functions are called destructors.\n\nFinalization is primarily used for cleanup, to release memory or other resources: to deallocate memory allocated via manual memory management; to clear references if reference counting is used (decrement reference counts); to release resources, particularly in the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom; or to unregister an object. The amount of finalization varies significantly between languages, from extensive finalization in C++, which has manual memory management, reference counting, and deterministic object lifetimes; to often no finalization in Java, which has non-deterministic object lifetimes and is often implemented with a tracing garbage collector. It is also possible for there to be little or no explicit (user-specified) finalization, but significant implicit finalization, performed by the compiler, interpreter, or runtime; this is common in case of automatic reference counting, as in the CPython reference implementation of Python, or in Automatic Reference Counting in Apple's implementation of Objective-C, which both automatically break references during finalization. A finalizer can include arbitrary code; a particularly complex use is to automatically return the object to an object pool.\n\nMemory deallocation during finalization is common in languages like C++ where manual memory management is standard, but also occurs in managed languages when memory has been allocated outside of the managed heap (externally to the language); in Java this occurs with Java Native Interface (JNI) and codice_2 objects in New I/O (NIO). This latter can cause problems due to the garbage collector not being able to track these external resources, so they will not be collected aggressively enough, and can cause out-of-memory errors due to exhausting unmanaged memory – this can be avoided by treating native memory as a resource and using the dispose pattern, as discussed below.\n\nFinalizers are generally both much less necessary and much less used than destructors. They are much less necessary because garbage collection automates memory management, and much less used because they are not generally executed deterministically – they may not be called in a timely manner, or even at all, and the execution environment cannot be predicted – and thus any cleanup that must be done in a deterministic way must instead be done by some other method, most frequently manually via the dispose pattern. Notably, both Java and Python do not guarantee that finalizers will ever be called, and thus they cannot be relied on for cleanup.\n\nDue to the lack of programmer control over their execution, it is usually recommended to avoid finalizers for any but the most trivial operations. In particular, operations often performed in destructors are not usually appropriate for finalizers. A common anti-pattern is to write finalizers as if they were destructors, which is both unnecessary and ineffectual, due to differences between finalizers and destructors. This is particularly common among C++ programmers, as destructors are heavily used in idiomatic C++, following the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom.\n\nProgramming languages that use finalizers include C++/CLI, C#, Clean, Go, Java, and Python. Syntax varies significantly by language.\n\nIn Java a finalizer is a method called codice_1, which overrides the codice_4 method.\n\nIn Python, a finalizer is a method called codice_5.\n\nIn Perl, a finalizer is a method called codice_6.\n\nIn C#, a finalizer (called \"destructor\" in earlier versions of the standard) is a method whose name is the class name with codice_7 prefixed, as in codice_8 – this is the same syntax as a C++ \"destructor\", and these methods were originally called \"destructors\", by analogy with C++, despite having different behavior, but were renamed to \"finalizers\" due to the confusion this caused.\n\nIn C++/CLI, which has both destructors and finalizers, a destructor is a method whose name is the class name with codice_7 prefixed, as in codice_8 (as in C#), and a finalizer is a method whose name is the class name with codice_11 prefixed, as in codice_12.\n\nIn Go finalizers are applied to a single pointer by calling the codice_13 function in the standard library.\n\nA finalizer is called when an object is garbage collected – after an object has become garbage (unreachable), but before its memory is deallocated. Finalization occurs non-deterministically, at the discretion of the garbage collector, and might never occur. This contrasts with destructors, which are called deterministically as soon as an object is no longer in use, and are always called, except in case of uncontrolled program termination. Finalizers are most frequently instance methods, due to needing to do object-specific operations.\n\nThe garbage collector must also account for the possibility of object resurrection. Most commonly this is done by first executing finalizers, then checking whether any objects have been resurrected, and if so, aborting their destruction. This additional check is potentially expensive – a simple implementation re-checks all garbage if even a single object has a finalizer – and thus both slows down and complicates garbage collection. For this reason, objects with finalizers may be collected less frequently than objects without finalizers (only on certain cycles), exacerbating problems caused by relying on prompt finalization, such as resource leaks.\n\nIf an object is resurrected, there is the further question of whether its finalizer is called again, when it is next destroyed – unlike destructors, finalizers are potentially called multiple times. If finalizers are called for resurrected objects, objects may repeatedly resurrect themselves and be indestructible; this occurs in the CPython implementation of Python prior to Python 3.4, and in CLR languages such as C#. To avoid this, in many languages, including Java, Objective-C (at least in recent Apple implementations), and Python from Python 3.4, objects are finalized at most once, which requires tracking if the object has been finalized yet.\n\nIn other cases, notably CLR languages like C#, finalization is tracked separately from the objects themselves, and objects can be repeatedly registered or deregistered for finalization.\n\nFinalizers can cause a significant number of problems, and are thus strongly discouraged by a number of authorities. These problems include:\n\nFurther, finalizers may fail to run due to object remaining reachable beyond when they are expected to be garbage, either due to programming errors or due to unexpected reachability. For example, when Python catches an exception (or an exception is not caught in interactive mode), it keeps a reference to the stack frame where the exception was raised, which keeps objects referenced from that stack frame alive.\n\nFinalizers in a superclass can also slow down garbage collection in a subclass, as the finalizer can potentially refer to fields in the subclass, and thus the field cannot be garbage collected until the following cycle, once the finalizer has run. This can be avoided by using composition over inheritance.\n\nA common anti-pattern is to use finalizers to release resources, by analogy with the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom of C++: acquire a resource in the initializer (constructor), and release it in the finalizer (destructor). This does not work, for a number of reasons. Most basically, finalizers may never be called, and even if called, may not be called in a timely manner – thus using finalizers to release resources will generally cause resource leaks. Further, finalizers are not called in a prescribed order, while resources often need to be released in a specific order, frequently the opposite order in which they were acquired. Also, as finalizers are called at the discretion of the garbage collector, they will often only be called under managed memory pressure (when there is little managed memory available), regardless of resource pressure – if scarce resources are held by garbage but there is plenty of managed memory available, garbage collection may not occur, thus not reclaiming these resources.\n\nThus instead of using finalizers for automatic resource management, in garbage-collected languages one instead must manually manage resources, generally by using the dispose pattern. In this case resources may still be acquired in the initializer, which is called explicitly on object instantiation, but are released in the dispose method. The dispose method may be called explicitly, or implicitly by language constructs such as C#'s codice_14, Java's codice_15-with-resources, or Python's codice_16.\n\nHowever, in certain cases both the dispose pattern and finalizers are used for releasing resources. This is primarily found in CLR languages such as C#, where finalization is used as a backup for disposal: when a resource is acquired, the acquiring object is queued for finalization so that the resource is released on object destruction, even if the resource is not released by manual disposal.\n\nIn languages with deterministic object lifetimes, notably C++, resource management is frequently done by tying resource possession lifetime to object lifetime, acquiring resources during initialization and releasing them during finalization; this is known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII). This ensures that resource possession is a class invariant, and that resources are released promptly when the object is destroyed.\n\nHowever, in languages with non-deterministic object lifetimes – which include all major languages with garbage collection, such as C#, Java, and Python – this does not work, because finalization may not be timely or may not happen at all, and thus resources may not be released for a long time or even at all, causing resource leaks. In these languages resources are instead generally managed manually via the dispose pattern: resources may still be acquired during initialization, but are released by calling a codice_17 method. Nevertheless, using finalization for releasing resources in these languages is a common anti-pattern, and forgetting to call codice_17 will still cause a resource leak.\n\nIn some cases both techniques are combined, using an explicit dispose method, but also releasing any still-held resources during finalization as a backup. This is commonly found in C#, and is implemented by registering an object for finalization whenever a resource is acquired, and suppressing finalization whenever a resource is released.\n\nIf user-specified finalizers are allowed, it is possible for finalization to cause object resurrection, as the finalizers can run arbitrary code, which may create references from live objects to objects being destroyed. For languages without garbage collection, this is a severe bug, and causes dangling references and memory safety violations; for languages with garbage collection, this is prevented by the garbage collector, most commonly by adding another step to garbage collection (after running all user-specified finalizers, check for resurrection), which complicates and slows down garbage collection.\n\nFurther, object resurrection means that an object may not be destroyed, and in pathological cases an object can always resurrect itself during finalization, making itself indestructible. To prevent this, some languages, like Java and Python (from Python 3.4) only finalize objects once, and do not finalize resurrected objects. Concretely this is done by tracking if an object has been finalized on an object-by-object basis. Objective-C also tracks finalization (at least in recent Apple versions) for similar reasons, treating resurrection as a bug.\n\nA different approach is used in the .NET Framework, notably C# and Visual Basic .NET, where finalization is tracked by a \"queue\", rather than by object. In this case, if a user-specified finalizer is provided, by default the object is only finalized once (it is queued for finalization on creation, and dequeued once it is finalized), but this can be changed via calling the codice_19 module. Finalization can be prevented by calling codice_20, which dequeues the object, or reactivated by calling codice_21, which enqueues the object. These are particularly used when using finalization for resource management as a supplement to the dispose pattern, or when implementing an object pool.\n\nFinalization is formally complementary to initialization – initialization occurs at the start of lifetime, finalization at the end – but differs significantly in practice. Both variables and objects are initialized, primarily to assign values, but in general only objects are finalized, and in general there is no need to clear values – the memory can simply be deallocated and reclaimed by the operating system.\n\nBeyond assigning initial values, initialization is primarily used to acquire resources or to register an object with some service (like an event handler). These actions have symmetric release or unregister actions, and these can symmetrically be handled in a finalizer, which is done in RAII. However, in many languages, notably those with garbage collection, object lifetime is asymmetric: object creation happens deterministically at some explicit point in the code, but object destruction happens non-deterministically, in some unspecified environment, at the discretion of the garbage collector. This asymmetry means that finalization cannot be effectively used as the complement of initialization, because it does not happen in a timely manner, in a specified order, or in a specified environment. The symmetry is partially restored by also disposing of the object at an explicit point, but in this case disposal and destruction do not happen at the same point, and an object may be in a \"disposed but still alive\" state, which weakens the class invariants and complicates use.\n\nVariables are generally initialized at the start of their lifetime, but not finalized at the end of their lifetime – though if a variable has an object as its value, the \"object\" may be finalized. In some cases variables are also finalized: GCC extensions allow finalization of variables.\n\nAs reflected in the naming, \"finalization\" and the codice_22 construct both fulfill similar purposes: performing some final action, generally cleaning up, after something else has finished. They differ in when they occur – a codice_22 clause is executed when program execution leaves the body of the associated codice_15 clause – this occurs during stack unwind, and there is thus a stack of pending codice_22 clauses, in order – while finalization occurs when an object is destroyed, which happens depending on the memory management method, and in general there is simply a set of objects awaiting finalization – often on the heap – which need not happen in any specific order.\n\nHowever, in some cases these coincide. In C++, object destruction is deterministic, and the behavior of a codice_22 clause can be produced by having a local variable with an object as its value, whose scope is a block corresponds to the body of a codice_15 clause – the object is finalized (destructed) when execution exits this scope, exactly as if there were a codice_22 clause. For this reason, C++ does not have a codice_22 construct – the difference being that finalization is defined in the class definition as the destructor method, rather than at the call site in a codice_22 clause.\n\nConversely, in the case of a codice_22 clause in a coroutine, like in a Python generator, the coroutine may never terminate – only ever yielding – and thus in ordinary execution the codice_22 clause is never executed. If one interprets instances of a coroutine as objects, then the codice_22 clause can be considered a finalizer of the object, and thus can be executed when the instance is garbage collected. In Python terminology, the definition of a coroutine is a generator \"function,\" while an instance of it is a generator \"iterator,\" and thus a codice_22 clause in a generator function becomes a finalizer in generator iterators instantiated from this function.\n\nThe notion of finalization as a separate step in object destruction dates to , by analogy with the earlier distinction of initialization in object construction in . Literature prior to this point used \"destruction\" for this process, not distinguishing finalization and deallocation, and programming languages dating to this period, like C++ and Perl, use the term \"destruction\". The terms \"finalize\" and \"finalization\" are also used in the influential book \"Design Patterns\" (1994). The introduction of Java in 1995 contained codice_1 methods, which popularized the term and associated it with garbage collection, and languages from this point generally make this distinction and use the term \"finalization\", particularly in the context of garbage collection.\n\n\n"}

During the winter months, the water in the ground freezes and expands. Once temperatures reach −17 degrees Celsius or lower, the ice that has already formed acts like a solid and expands to form cracks in the surface known as ice wedges. As this process continues over many years ice wedges can grow, up to the size of a swimming pool. Ice wedges usually appear in a polygonal pattern known as ice wedge polygons. The cracks can also be filled with materials other than ice, especially sand, and then they're called sand wedges.\n\nThere are many theories that attempt to explain the origin of ice wedges but only one has been consistently supported by most prominent scientists: the thermal contraction theory.\n\nThe thermal contraction theory posits that during the winter months, thermal contraction cracks form only a few cm wide and a couple of metres deep because of the extreme cold weather. Over the next few months, the snow melts and the remaining water fills the cracks and the permafrost below the surface freezes it. These tiny cracks turn into permafrost. Once the summer months arrive, the permafrost expands; horizontal compression produces upturning of the frozen sediment by plastic deformation. The next winter the cold refreezes and cracks the already forming ice wedge, opening a way for the melting snow of spring to fill the empty crack. The mean annual air temperature thought needed to form ice wedges is −6° to −8 °C or colder.\n\nThere are three different forms of ice wedges: active, inactive and casts. All three forms are prevalent today and can be found in different parts of the world.\n\nActive ice wedges are those that are still evolving and growing. During each year, a layer of ice will be added if cracking occurs, but cracking need not occur every year to be considered active. The area in which most ice wedges remain active is along the permafrost zone. The number of active ice wedges that are cracking yearly is consistently declining as they become inactive.\n\nInactive ice wedges are wedges that are no longer cracking and growing. Throughout the winter months, the wedge does not split and therefore in the summer no new water is added.\n\nIn areas of past permafrost, ice wedges have melted and are no longer filled with ice. The wedge, which is now empty, is filled with sediment and dirt from the surrounding walls. These are called ice wedge casts and are used to estimate the climate of hundreds of thousands of years ago.\n\nIce wedges have historically been classified into two main categories: epigenetic and syngenetic. The type of an ice wedges refer to the way in which the wedge grows over time. Relatively recent field studies have revealed a new type of ice wedge: anti-syngenetic. Currently, these are the only three distinctly classified types of ice wedges observed in nature. The differences among the growth patterns of epigenetic, syngenetic and anti-syngenetic wedges then depend upon ground surface conditions, i.e. whether the ground level remains essentially unchanged or whether there is addition or loss of material.\n\n‘Epigenetic’ in geological terms refers to geological features that formed after the formation of the surrounding materials. In relation to ice wedges, this means that epigenetic ice wedges are found to form in preexisting permafrost, and are not formed at the same time as the permafrost meaning they are much younger than the surrounding material. An ice wedge being epigenetic also refers to the fashion in which they grow. These types of ice wedges grow considerably wider over their lifetime, but rarely any deeper or taller. This means that epigenetic ice wedges can grow to at most 3–5 meters in width, but stay roughly the same depth/height as when they had formed. Typically, the sediments on either side of an epigenetic ice wedge, adjacent to the edges of the wedge exhibit upward bending. In an epigenetic ice wedge, the age of the ice on the periphery changes little from top to bottom.\n\nSyngenetic ice wedges, like the epigenetic variety, find their roots in the geological term syngenetic, which means forming at the same time as the surrounding material. This is because syngenetic ice wedges grow as the upper permafrost surface rises in response to the addition of material on the ground surface. This allows syngenetic ice wedges to grow very deep, as the surface around them rises with the accumulation of alluvium (in floodplains), peat (in tundra), and gelifluction deposits (at the bottom of a slope), among other materials. Syngenetic ice wedges may only form if the thermal contraction and subsequent ice-veinlet growth can keep pace with the addition of new material. If this is the case, the ice wedge can reach depths of 25 meters, but the average is much less. In a syngenetic ice wedge, the age of the ice on the periphery decreases upwards.\n\nAnti-syngenetic ice wedge were first observed in 1990 during the fieldwork of J. Ross Mackay. Mackay found that anti-syngenetic grew in conditions opposite to those of syngenetic ice wedges in that the anti-syngenetic variety required the removal of material instead of the accumulation and addition of material. Anti-syngenetic ice wedges only form on slopes, where there is a net loss of materials erosion. Similar to syngenetic ice wedges, anti-syngenetic ice wedges can only occur if the rate of thermal contraction cracking and ice-veinlet growth keeps pace with the removal of active material. Anti-syngenetic ice wedges therefore only grow downwards, penetrating deeper into the soil only as the upper layers are removed by mass wasting and erosion. In an anti-syngenetic ice wedge, the age of the ice on the periphery increases upwards.\n"}

The ensemble was founded and is conducted by musicologist and organist John O'Donnell in 1990. The group is named after Nicolas Gombert (c. 1495 – 1560), whose music has largely been ignored in the centuries since his death, despite it having an exemplary reputation amongst his contemporaries.\n\nAlthough Ensemble Gombert performs a wide range of choral music, ranging from plainchant to contemporary works, it specialises in \"a cappella\" performance of Franco-Flemish music of the High Renaissance, that is, polyphonic music of the 16th century. The Ensemble has achieved an important place in the early music scene by re-introducing many forgotten Renaissance masterworks to the concert repertoire, using newly prepared editions by O’Donnell. These works are frequently juxtaposed in innovative programs with more widely known repertoire from later periods.\n\nPerformances in recent years have included a program of little-known works by Franco-Flemish composers Johannes Ghiselin, Jacquet of Berchem, Gaspar van Weebeke, Andreas de Silva, Nicolas Payen and Josquin des Prez, a quincentennial celebration of Thomas Tallis, the first Australian performance of Arvo Pärt's 'Canon of Repentance' (composed in 1998), works by Jean Richafort and his parodists, a program of works originally written for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, German Baroque masterpieces by Johann Hermann Schein, Michael Praetorius, Heinrich Schütz and Johann Sebastian Bach, Alessandro Scarlatti's 'Stabat mater', and an annual concert entitled 'Christmas to Candlemas' that presents works written for the numerous Christian feast-days in the forty-day Church season that begins on Christmas Day.\n\nThe ensemble has broadcast extensively on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's ABC Classic FM radio network, as well as the Melbourne-based community arts station 3MBS. It has appeared at many festivals across Australia, including the annual Organs of the Goldfields Festival in Ballarat, and the Woodend Winter Arts Festival, has toured to the United States and Canada, and three times to Europe, and has released two CD recordings: \"Josquin to Martin\" on the Move label (2004) and \"Christmas to Candlemas\" for Tall Poppies Records (2006).

{"id": "1815563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815563", "title": "Rockfall", "text": "Rockfall\n\nA rockfall or rock-fall refers to quantities of rock falling freely from a cliff face. The term is also used for collapse of rock from roof or walls of mine or quarry workings. \"A rockfall is a fragment of rock (a block) detached by sliding, toppling, or falling, that falls along a vertical or sub-vertical cliff, proceeds down slope by bouncing and flying along ballistic trajectories or by rolling on talus or debris slopes.\"\n\nAlternatively, a \"rockfall is the natural downward motion of a detached block or series of blocks with a small volume involving free falling, bouncing, rolling, and sliding\". The mode of failure differs from that of a rockslide.\n\nFavourable geology and climate are the principal causal mechanisms of rockfall, factors that include intact condition of the rock mass, discontinuities within the rockmass, weathering susceptibility, ground and surface water, freeze-thaw, root-wedging, and external stresses. A tree may be blown by the wind, and this causes a pressure at the root level and this loosens rocks and can trigger a fall. The pieces of rock collect at the bottom creating a \"talus\" or \"scree\". Rocks falling from the cliff may dislodge other rocks and serve to create another mass wasting process, for example an avalanche.\n\nA cliff that has favorable geology to a rockfall may be said to be incompetent. One that is not favorable to a rockfall, which is better consolidated, may be said to be competent.\n\nIn high mountains rockfalls may be caused by thawing of rock masses with permafrost. Yet in lower mountains with warmer climates rockfalls may be caused by weathering being enhanced by non-freezing condition.\n\nTypically, rockfall events are mitigated in one of two ways: either by passive mitigation or active mitigation. Passive mitigation is where only the effects of the rockfall event are mitigated and are generally employed in the deposition or run-out zones, such as through the use of drape nets, rockfall catchment fences, diversion dams, etc. The rockfall still takes place but an attempt is made to control the outcome. In contrast, active mitigation is carried out in the initiation zone and prevents the rockfall event from ever occurring. Some examples of these measures are rock bolting, slope retention systems, shotcrete, etc. Other active measures might be by changing the geographic or climatic characteristics in the initiation zone, e.g. altering slope geometry, dewatering the slope, revegetation, etc.\n\nDesign guides of passive measures have been proposed by Ritchie (1963), Pierson et al. (2001), Pantelidis (2010) and Bar et al. (2016)\n\nThe effect of rockfalls on trees can be seen in several ways. The tree roots may rotate, via the rotational energy of the rockfall. The tree may move via the application of translational energy. And lastly deformation may occur, either elastic or plastic. Dendrochronology can reveal a past impact, with missing tree rings, as the tree rings grow around and close over a gap; the callus tissue can be seen microscopically. A macroscopic section can be used for dating of avalanche and rockfall events.\n"}

Adams is well known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), under the name Crush, and for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name Brian Adams. Trained in Japan by Antonio Inoki, he was a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion, a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion and a one-time AJPW World Tag Team Champion, among other accomplishments. He was a challenger for various singles titles in the WWF and WCW, including the WWF Championship. In 2002, he briefly tried a career in boxing until retiring due to back and shoulder injuries. Five years later, he died of accidental respiratory failure from a combination of buprenorphine, carisoprodol, chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam.\n\nBrian Adams was born in Kona, Hawaii and was raised in Kealakekua, Hawaii and attended Konawaena High School. After graduating from high school, Adams joined the US Air Force, where he began boxing. It was during his time in the USAF, while stationed in Japan, that he was also exposed to wrestling. Adams was trained in wrestling by famed Japanese wrestler and mixed martial artist Antonio Inoki. In 1986, after training in Japan, Adams came to the United States and began working in Portland, Oregon's Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW).\n\nBrian Adams made his debut for New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1986. However, his work visa expired, forcing him to return to the United States.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW) promotion, he was given the nickname The American Ninja and was put in a tag team called \"The Wrecking Crew\" with Len Denton, who wrestled under a mask, billed as \"The Grappler\". Adams and Denton were the Pacific Northwest Tag Team Champions for a time and worked a feud with the Southern Rockers, Steve Doll and Rex King. In May 1988, he took part in Billy Jack Haynes' short-lived Oregon Wrestling Federation. In 1990, he won the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship after winning a tournament final match against Larry Oliver in Portland on April 21, 1990 for the vacant title. He lost the title to Scott Norton on May 12, 1990 in Portland.\n\nIn September 1987, Adams returned to NJPW with a couple of victories over Kenichi Oya. By February 1988, he began wearing a mask and going by the name The Midnight Soldier. Although he was usually on the losing end of most of the matches, he wrestled to a double countout with George Takano and held a victory over Tatsutoshi Goto.\n\nIn January 1989, Adams went to All Japan Pro Wrestling for its New Year's Giant Series tour.\n\nIn June 1990, while still working for the PNW, Adams debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Crush, the third member of the Tag Team Champions Demolition. With Adams joining Demolition, the trio exercised the Freebird Rule allowing any combination of the three to defend the tag team title, which allowed Crush to become a Tag Team Champion. He was brought in as a substitute for Ax to defend the titles with Smash. Crush debuted at a live event on June 5, where he and Smash successfully defended the titles against The Rockers. Crush made his televised debut with Demolition on the June 23 episode of \"Superstars\", teaming with Smash in a quick victory over Paul Diamond and Joe Champ. On the July 28 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXVII\", Crush and Smash retained the titles against The Rockers, after Ax (who was the illegal man) clotheslined and pinned Shawn Michaels. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Demolition, with new member Crush, lost the title to The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match with Crush getting pinned for the final fall to lose the title. After SummerSlam, Demolition shifted focus from the belts to their already incipient feud with The Legion of Doom which had intensified after the latter team interfered in the title change match. Adams continued to perform as part of Demolition until after WrestleMania VII where he and Smash lost to Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kitao. After WrestleMania, the WWF decided to disband Demolition as a team.\n\nUpon his departure from the WWF, Adams, who continued to use the Crush gimmick, returned to PNW. He was portrayed as a dominant wrestler, winning both the Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship and the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. Adams received the first of these two championships during this stint in the PNW while teaming with previous rival Steve Doll and defeating The Bruise Brothers for the Tag Team Championship on July 27, 1991 in Portland, Oregon. They remained the champions until September 1, 1991 when they lost the title to The Grappler and Don Harris. A little more than a month later, Adams received his second Pacific Northwest Heavyweight title, on October 12, 1991, in Portland after he defeated Rip Oliver via submission to the Full Nelson hold. Adams was the champion for just over three months, losing the title to Ron Harris at a show in Portland, on January 18, 1992.\n\nAdams went back to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan favorite character of an easygoing surfing Hawaiian who wore bright neon tights and utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the \"Cranium Crunch\". Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of \"Superstars\", defeating Kato. The two would continue to work at house shows that month. Crush made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man (Barry Darsow, who also played Crush's former Demolition partner, Smash) at SummerSlam. Crush then engaged in a feud with Doink the Clown, after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where Crush lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck Crush with the prosthetic arm. At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.\n\nOn July 4, Crush injured his back in the Stars and Stripes Challenge trying to bodyslam the WWF Champion Yokozuna, who at the time had a billed weight of . The bodyslam challenge took place on the US Navy Aircraft carrier USS \"Intrepid\". Crush, generally considered to have the best chance of those present, was the first wrestler to actually get Yokozuna off his feet but his back gave out forcing him to stop. Lex Luger won the challenge. On the July 12 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Crush unsuccessfully challenged Yokozuna for the WWF Championship. After the match, Yokozuna sent a message to Luger by performing several \"Banzai Drops\" to Crush. This angle was used to write Crush off television to recover from his back injury and was relaxing on Kailua Beach From August to September and returned that following October.\n\nCrush returned to WWF on the October 18 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" and attacked his on-screen friend Randy Savage, because Savage had encouraged him to enter the Body Slam Challenge, and had failed to contact him during recuperation. Crush then allied himself with Yokozuna and Mr. Fuji, becoming a villain. Adams adopted a \"Japanese sympathizer\" character to go with his new attitude. The new gimmick included: growing a beard, using a new face paint design different from his Demolition character, and wearing a darker color scheme than the pink and orange Kona Crush character. He also became billed as being from Oahu At Survivor Series, Crush headlined the event as part of Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga and Quebecer Jacques) against All-Americans (Lex Luger, The Undertaker and Steiner Brothers). This rivalry led to a falls count anywhere match against Savage at WrestleMania X, which he lost.\n\nCrush would become a hired gun for his manager Mr. Fuji, helping his new client Jeff Jarrett win a King of the Ring qualifying match against Lex Luger on the May 21 episode of \"Superstars\" by attacking Luger outside the ring, causing him to lose by count-out. In retaliation, Luger cost Crush a King of the Ring qualifying lumberjack match against Tatanka on the June 6 episode of \"Raw\". As a result, the pair began a short program. During the rivalry, Crush formed a tag team with Fuji's client Yokozuna, challenging The Headshrinkers for the Tag Team Championship at King of the Ring. They lost the match after Luger distracted Crush. Their rivalry culminated in a match on the August 21 episode of \"Sunday Night Slam\", which Luger won after Ted DiBiase distracted Crush. Afterwards, Crush lost a series of non-televised matches to The Undertaker in Europe in early September, and then subsequently left the WWF.\n\nIn 1995, Crush returned to the WWF at Royal Rumble and took part in the Royal Rumble match as the #30 entrant. He eliminated Billy Gunn, Bart Gunn, Adam Bomb, and Headshrinker Fatu before being eliminated by British Bulldog. The Royal Rumble was the only wrestling appearance for Adams in 1995 for the WWF. On March 13, while home in Hawaii, he was arrested and subsequently jailed for purchasing steroids and possessing an illegal hand gun.\n\nAfter a brief stint in jail, Adams was brought back to the WWF with a new biker look at the beginning of the Monday Night Wars, with his real-life incarceration being referenced as part of a storyline on \"Raw\". He made his surprise return to WWF on the August 12, 1996 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", with Clarence Mason, his (kayfabe) lawyer as his manager. He defeated Savio Vega with a full nelson and began using the heart punch as his new finishing move. At Survivor Series, Crush was paired with Goldust, Jerry Lawler and Hunter Hearst Helmsley against Marc Mero, Jake Roberts, Rocky Maivia and Barry Windham in a Survivor Series match. Crush's team was on the losing end. In the fall of 1996, Crush began a rivalry with Vega, during which, he and Clarence Mason joined Nation of Domination (NOD) under the leadership of Faarooq, another client of Mason.\n\nCrush's rivalry with Vega ended when he joined the Nation in early 1997. Crush aided Faarooq in his feud with Ahmed Johnson. After his loss to Goldust at King of the Ring, Crush argued with Savio Vega, during Faarooq's WWF Championship title shot, which distracted Faarooq, causing him to lose the match. The following night on \"Raw is War\", Crush and Vega, along with the rest of Nation were fired by Faarooq, turning Crush face for the first time since 1993. As a result, Crush began feuding with Faarooq and formed his own biker faction called Disciples of Apocalypse, which was introduced on the June 23 episode of \"Raw is War\".\n\nCrush led the DOA into a gang war against Faarooq's Nation of Domination and Savio Vega's Los Boricuas throughout the late 1997, thus turning into a fan favorite. The three leaders fought in a triple threat match at , which Vega won. The DOA traded wins with Los Boricuas at SummerSlam, and the November 22 episode of \"Shotgun Saturday Night\". DOA had their next rivalry with The Truth Commission, which culminated in a Survivor Series match between the two teams at Survivor Series, which Truth Commission won.\n\nAdams left the WWF in the fall of 1997, partially in protest to the Montreal Screwjob. His absence was explained by a storyline injury sustained during a brawl with Kane on the November 24 episode of \"Raw is War\". Crush's last appearance was on the November 29 episode of \"Shotgun Saturday Night\", where DOA defeated enhancement talents Steve Corino, Marty Garner, Mike Hollow, and Jason Ahrndt.\n\nAdams signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and made his debut on the February 16, 1998 episode of \"Nitro\" as a heel by attacking Bret Hart, revealing himself as the newest member of the New World Order (nWo). Adams made his in-ring debut on the February 19 episode of \"Thunder\" in a tag team match with nWo teammate Curt Hennig against Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart, with the match resulting in a double disqualification. The nWo split in April 1998 and Adams chose to join Hollywood Hogan's nWo Hollywood faction. Adams made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at Slamboree against Lex Luger in a losing effort.\n\nAdams received a shot for the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg on the July 27 episode of \"Nitro\", but failed to win the title. He lost to Steve McMichael at Road Wild and pulled out an upset win over Eddie Guerrero on the August 30 episode of \"Monday Nitro\", only after Guerrero laid down for Adams on purpose due to his protest with WCW management.\n\nAdams became a lower card performer, he often tag-teamed with the likes of Scott Norton and Stevie Ray, occasionally losing matches against smaller and lesser known wrestlers. However, he also gained quick victories over enhancement talents in singles competition. He was usually used by the nWo as a henchman due to his big size. Adams and Norton defeated Fit Finlay and Jerry Flynn in Adams' debut at Starrcade.\n\nIn 1999, Adams was put into nWo Black and White or nWo B-Team, a group of mid-card nWo wrestlers of the nWo Reunion after both nWo factions united. Adams was put into a partnership with Horace Hogan and the two participated in a tournament to crown the new World Tag Team Champions. They ousted Billy Kidman and Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Faces of Fear before losing to Curt Henning and Barry Windham and Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko in semi-final matches.\n\nAfterwards, he was chosen to portray the KISS-themed wrestler \"The Demon\" after walking out on the New World Order and entering a limo that supposedly had the band inside. He played the character for its debut on the August 23 episode of \"Nitro\" in which KISS also played a live concert. He would play it one more time to come out and have a staredown with Vampiro and abandoned it afterwards without wrestling. The Demon mantle was subsequently passed to Dale Torborg with no explanation given. Adams switched back to competing under his given name and returned for a title shot for the United States Heavyweight Championship against Sid Vicious on the October 4 episode of \"Nitro\", where he lost. After defeating Horace Hogan on the October 13 episode of \"Thunder\", Adams took a hiatus.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Adams received the biggest push of his WCW career when he was put into a tag team with Bryan Clark called KroniK. The team debuted at Spring Stampede as Vince Russo's mercenaries in the New Blood stable, helping Shane Douglas and Buff Bagwell to beat Ric Flair and Lex Luger to win the World Tag Team Championship by delivering a \"High Times\" to Luger.\n\nHowever, KroniK switched allegiances to The Millionaire's Club after Russo betrayed them and they defeated Douglas and The Wall to win the World Tag Team Championship for the first time on the May 15 episode of \"Nitro\", thus turning faces. KroniK dropped the belts to New Blood members Perfect Event on the May 31 episode of \"Thunder\". At The Great American Bash, KroniK defeated The Mamalukes to earn a title shot at the tag team titles and began their second reign by beating Perfect Event at Bash at the Beach. KroniK then entered a rivalry with the entire Natural Born Thrillers faction, and retained the tag team titles against the Thrillers and Misfits in Action in a Four Corners match before losing them to Vampiro and The Great Muta at New Blood Rising.\n\nFollowing the title loss, KroniK lost a first blood chain match to The Harris Brothers at Fall Brawl. In the fall of 2000, KroniK began working as \"hired muscles\", based on WWF's tag team Acolytes Protection Agency. On the October 2 episode of \"Nitro\", KroniK turned heels after Vince Russo managed to bribe them in order to have them attack Goldberg, resulting in a handicap elimination match at Halloween Havoc, which Goldberg won.\n\nKroniK helped The Boogie Knights battle The Filthy Animals in subsequent matches at Mayhem and Millennium Final. As the year ended, KroniK were hired by their former enemies, the Natural Born Thrillers, during which they helped them at the Starrcade event, by facing Reno and Big Vito in a tag team match, during which Reno turned on Vito and had been revealed as the one who had paid KroniK to assault Vito in the previous weeks. A month later, at Sin, KroniK turned faces by ending their association with Thrillers, as they turned on Thrillers leader Mike Sanders by helping Ernest Miller beat Sanders to become the WCW Commissioner. The following month, at SuperBrawl Revenge, KroniK made their final pay-per-view appearance, where they were scheduled to face Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell), in a #1 contender's match for the tag team titles. Clark was injured by Mike Awesome before the match, leaving Adams to face them in a handicap match, which he lost. KroniK remained with WCW until the company was purchased by WWF on March 23, 2001.\n\nAfter the WWF's purchase of WCW, KroniK appeared in WWF as part of the Alliance storyline. During their time in WWF, they were managed by Steven Richards and were placed in a short feud with The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane). Adams and Clark faced, and lost to, the duo at the 2001 Unforgiven pay-per-view. They were both released soon after.\n\nAdams and Clark briefly worked for World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) in early 2002. They then traveled to Japan to work for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). On July 17, 2002, at an AJPW pay-per-view, Adams and Clark defeated Keiji Mutoh and Taiyō Kea for the World Tag Team Championship. Adams and Clark remained champions until November 2002 when AJPW declared the title vacant, because Adams had left the promotion to pursue a boxing career.\n\nAfter recovering from his shoulder injury, Adams returned to wrestling for \"Wrestle 1\", a pay-per-view for the Japanese promotion W-1, which was held at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. In January 2003, he made his last in-ring appearance, teaming with Bryan Clark, and facing Bill Goldberg and Keiji Mutoh in a losing effort. He suffered a spinal injury in this match that forced him into retirement.\n\nAdams was scheduled to have his first boxing match, against Rick Zufale, on November 16, 2002 at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada with professional wrestler Randy Savage in his corner. This bout was to air on the \"Never Surrender\" boxing pay-per-view, but during his training for the bout, Adams injured his shoulder and was unable to fight.\n\nOn March 13, 1995, Adams was arrested at his home in Kona, Hawaii, after narcotics officers searched his home and discovered 500 units of anabolic steroids and several unregistered semi-automatic guns. He was released on $10,275 bail. On October 28, 1995, he was sentenced to five years probation after pleading no-contest to 11 counts of drug and weapons charges.\n\nIn 1996, Adams had an uncredited role in the Bollywood movie \"Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi\". In the movie, he played \"Crush\" and was killed by \"The Undertaker\" (played by Brian Lee) in a wrestling match.\n\nAdams had surgery to attempt to correct his spinal injury, but it left him unfit to continue to wrestle. Following his retirement, Adams became a bodyguard for his longtime friend, wrestler-turned-rapper Randy Savage, who was touring to promote his CD, \"Be a Man\". It was reported that Adams was living on income from a Lloyd's of London insurance policy. Adams expressed interest in opening a health club in Tampa, Florida, which was to be a franchise of fellow wrestler Marc Mero's \"Body Slam\" training center. Adams and his wife had two children.\n\nOn August 13, 2007, Adams was found unconscious by his wife at their Tampa, Florida home. The medical examiner concluded that he died as a result of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815587", "title": "Crown Australian Poker Championship", "text": "Crown Australian Poker Championship\n\nThe Australian Poker Championship, commonly known as Aussie Millions, is a series of poker tournaments held at the Crown Casino, in Melbourne, Australia. The Main Event of the series is the Southern Hemisphere's richest poker tournament with a prize pool in excess of 7 million.\n\nPoker at Crown was introduced in June 1997, with the first major championship held shortly after in July 1998. The Main Event was a $1,000 buy in Limit Holdem tournament that attracted 74 entries with a $74,000 prize pool. The Crown Australian Poker Championship, or the ‘Aussie Millions’ as it became known, moved to January in 2001, attracting 40 entrants with a $5,000 buy in for a prize pool of $200,000. January 2003 saw the event go international, attracting a field of 122 entrants and a $1,200,000 prize pool. In January 2005, the Aussie Millions continued to grow with 263 participants paying $10,000 each to enter the No Limit Hold'em Main Event, generating the biggest prize pool ever in the Southern Hemisphere of $2,630,000. Over half the field was from overseas including players from New Zealand, England, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, the USA, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, Italy and Lebanon. In 2006, 418 players competed for a share of the $4,180,000 prize pool, including some of the biggest names in the Poker world such as WSOP Champion Joe Hachem, along with Phil Ivey, John Juanda and Daniel Negreanu. The 2007 championship commenced on Sunday 14 January 2007 with the final table held on Friday 19 January 2007. The buy-in was $10,500 ($10,000+$500). A record 747 players entered, which generated a prize pool of $7,470,000. The top 80 players were \"in the money\" and received between $15,000 and $1,500,000 each.\n\nThe 2008 championship concluded on Sunday 20 January 2008 with the winner being the 21-year-old Russian Alexander Kostritsyn. The buy-in was $10,500 ($10,000+$500). A record 780 players entered, which generated a prize pool of $7,800,000. The top 80 players were \"in the money\" and received between $15,000 and $1,650,000 each. The 2009 event will feature a total of 15 tournaments. The Main Event will have a guaranteed $2 million first prize. It will also feature ten players taking part in the first Million Dollar Poker Cash Game, the largest poker game of its kind anywhere in the world. Ten players will be required to stake a minimum of $1 million, though it is expected that some players will bring more to the table. The Aussie Millions is now regarded as the largest poker tournament in the Southern Hemisphere and the sixth-largest internationally (by prizepool).\n\nIn 2013, Crown's Aussie Millions Poker Championship television coverage, produced by McGuire Media in conjunction with Poker PROductions, was a nine-episode series broadcast on One HD and ESPN Australia. The series was hosted by Lynn Gilmartin, with commentary by Joe Hachem and Jonno Pittock, as well as pro analysis by Antonio Esfandiari.\n\nThe structure of the Main Event is slightly different from that of most other major tournaments. While most major Hold 'em tournaments, including the World Series of Poker Main Event, play at nine-handed tables throughout, the Aussie Millions Main Event begins with eight-handed tables. Play continues eight-handed until the field is reduced to 36 players, at which point all tables are six-handed. The 2009 Aussie Millions Main Event structure will see Day 1 divided into three flights, with blind levels of 90 minutes' duration. From Day 2 until the completion of the tournament, the blind levels are 120 minutes long.\n\nThe Aussie Millions is also known for its high roller tournaments, which have featured some of the highest buy-ins in history.\n\nThe high roller trend began in 2006 when the Aussie Millions launched its $100,000 No Limit Holdem Challenge (actual buy in is $100,500, including the $500 entry fee), at that time billed as the highest buy-in of any poker tournament in history. It has a particularly unusual structure:\nThe $100,000 Challenge was first played in 2006, with 10 entrants. Eighteen entered the Challenge in 2007, 25 in 2008, and 24 in 2010. Daniel Shak won the 2010 tournament for a total prize of A$1,200,000. A record field of 38 played in the 2011 edition.\n\nWith a number of other poker events adding tournaments with buy-ins comparable to that of the $100,000 Challenge, the Aussie Millions added a tournament with a $250,000 buy-in in 2011, which the organisers again claimed as the world's highest. (Since then, the World Series of Poker has held an official event with a US$1 million buy-in.) It was originally scheduled to be a heads-up no-limit event, but the organisers changed the format twice, settling on what they thought would be a single-table no-limit hold 'em tournament. However, 20 players entered the inaugural $250K tournament, including major stars Phil Ivey, Erik Seidel, Tom Dwan, Chris Ferguson, John Juanda, David Benyamine and Annette Obrestad, plus Sam Trickett, who had just won that year's $100K event. Seidel, who had finished second in the $100K event, won the $2.5 million first prize, defeating Trickett in heads-up play.\n\nThe 2012 event was won by Ivey, who defeated 15 other players to win $2 million, the largest prize of his career. Trickett won the 2013 event, also winning $2 million after defeating 17 other players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most peninsular rivers in India flow eastward into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nIt has given its name to the Mahi Kantha agency of Bombay, and also to the mehwasis, marauding highlanders often mentioned in Arabian chronicles.\n\nThe exact position of Mahi River origin is Minda Village, which is situated in Dhar district Madhya Pradesh.\n\nMahi River, stream in western India. It rises in the western Vindhya Range, just south of Sardarpur, and flows northward through Madhya Pradesh state. Turning northwest, it enters Rajasthan state and then turns southwest to flow through Gujarat state through the north of Vadodara city outskirts and enters the sea by a wide estuary before Khambhat after about a 360-mile (580-km) course. The silt brought down by the Mahi has contributed to the shallowing of the Gulf of Khambhat and the abandonment of its once-prosperous ports.

{"id": "1815672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815672", "title": "Vedic priesthood", "text": "Vedic priesthood\n\nPriests of the Vedic religion are officiants of the \"yajna\" service. As persons trained for the ritual and proficient in its practice, they were called (\"regularly-sacrificing\"). As members of a social class, they were generically known as vipra \"sage\" or kavi \"seer\". Specialization of roles attended the elaboration and development of the ritual corpus over time. Eventually a full complement of sixteen \"s became the custom for major ceremonies. The sixteen consisted of four chief priests and their assistants.\n\nThe older references uniformly indicate the \" as the presiding priest, with perhaps only the \"adhvaryu\" as his assistant in the earliest times. The phrase \"seven hotars\" is found more than once in the Rigveda. Hymn 2.1.2 of Rigveda states it as follows,\n\nThe above hymn enumerate the priests as the ', ', ', \"agnīdh\", ' (meaning the \"maitrāvaruna\") and \"adhvaryu\".\n\n\nThe term Brahman in the above hymn 2.1.2 refers to deity Agni of hymn 2.1.1.\n\nThe rgvedic Brahmanas, Aitareya and Kausitaki, specify seven \"hotraka\"s to recite \"shastra\"s (litanies): ', \"brāhmanācchamsin\", \"maitrāvaruna\", ', \"\", \"agnīdh\" and \"acchāvāka\". They also carry a legend to explain the origin of the offices of the \"subrahmanya\" and the \"grāvastut\".\n\nThe requirements of the fully developed ritual were rigorous enough that only professional priests could perform them adequately. Thus, whereas in the earliest times, the true sacrificer, or intended beneficiary of the rite, might have been a direct participant, in Vedic times he was only a sponsor, the \"yajamāna\", with the ' or \"brahman\" taking his stead in the ritual. In this seconding lay the origins of the growing importance of the purohita (literally, \"one who is placed in front\"). It was not unusual for a \"purohita\" to be the ' or \"brahman\" at a sacrifice for his master, besides conducting other more domestic (\"\") rituals for him also. In latter days, with the disappearance of Vedic ritual practice, \"purohita\" has become a generic term for \"priest\".\n\nIn the systematic expositions of the \"shrauta sutras\", which date to the fifth or sixth century BCE, the assistants are classified into four groups associated with each of the four chief priests, although the classifications are artificial and in some cases incorrect:\n\n\nThis last classification is incorrect, as the formal assistants of the \"brahman\" were actually assistants of the \"\" and the \"adhvaryu\".\n\nComparison with the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, a distinct religion with the same origins, shows the antiquity of terms for priests such as \"*atharwan\" (Vedic \"atharvan\"; cognate to Avestan \"āθrauuan\" / \"aθaurun\") and \"*zhautar\" (Ved. \"hotar\"; Av. \"zaotar\") \"invoker, sacrificer\". While \"*zhautar\" is well understood, the original meaning of \"*atharwan\" is unknown. The word \"atharvan\" appears in the Rig Veda (e.g., in RV 6.16.13 where Agni is said to have been churned by Atharvan from the mind of every poet). In the Younger Avesta, \"āθrauuan\" / \"aθaurun\" appears in a context that suggests \"missionary,\" perhaps by metathesis from Indo-Iranian \"*arthavan\" \"possessing purpose.\" However, a recent theory indicates that Proto Indo-Iranian \"*atharwan\" likely represents a substrate word from the unknown language of the BMAC civilization of Central Asia. It can be analyzed as BMAC \"*athar-\" plus the Indo-Iranian possessive suffix \"*-wan\", in which case \"*atharwan\" would be \"one who possesses \"*athar\"\". Though the meaning of \"*athar\" is unknown, Pinault speculates that it meant \"superior force\" and connects it to the Tocharian word for \"hero\". In the Upanishads, \"atharvan\" appears for example in \"atharvāngiras\", a compound of \"atharvan\" and \"angiras\", either two eponymous rishis or their family names.\n\nIn present-day Indian Zoroastrian (Parsi) tradition the word \"athornan\" is used to distinguish the priesthood from the laity (the \"behdin\"). These subdivisions (in the historical Indian context, \"castes\"), and the terms used to describe them, are relatively recent developments specific to Indian Zoroastrians and although the words themselves are old, the meaning that they came to have for the Parsis are influenced by their centuries-long coexistence with Hinduism. It appears then that the Indian Zoroastrian priests re-adopted the older \"āθrauuan\" / \"aθaurun\" (in preference to the traditional, and very well attested derivative \"āsron\") for its similarity to Hinduism's \"atharvan\", which the Parsi priests then additionally assumed was derived from Avestan \"ātar\" \"fire\". This folk-etymology, which may \"have been prompted by what is probably a mistaken assumption of the importance of fire in the ancient Indo-Iranian religion\" (Boyce, 1982:16).\n\nThe division of priestly functions among the Hotar, the Udgatar and the Adhvaryu has been compared to the Celtic priesthood as reported by Strabo, with the Druids as high priests, the Bards doing the chanting and the Vates performing the actual sacrifice.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815700", "title": "Battle of Mohi", "text": "Battle of Mohi\n\nThe Battle of Mohi (11 April 1241), also known as Battle of the Sajó River or Battle of the Tisza River, was the main battle between the Mongol Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary during the Mongol invasion of Europe. It took place at Muhi (then Mohi), southwest of the Sajó River. After the invasion, Hungary lay in ruins. Nearly half of the inhabited places had been destroyed by the invading armies. Around 15–25 percent of the population was lost, mostly in lowland areas, especially in the Great Hungarian Plain, the southern reaches of the Hungarian plain in the area now called the Banat and in southern Transylvania.\n\nThe Mongols attacked Eastern Europe with five distinct armies. Two of them attacked through Poland in order to protect the flank from Bela's Polish cousins, winning several victories. Most notably, they defeated the army of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia at Legnica. A southern army attacked Transylvania, defeated the voivod and crushed the Transylvanian armies. The main army led by Khan Batu and Subutai attacked Hungary through the fortified Verecke Pass and annihilated the army led by Denis Tomaj, the count palatine, on 12 March 1241, while the final army under Batu's brother Shiban marched in an arc north of the main force. Prior to the invasion, King Bela had personally supervised the construction of dense natural barriers along Hungary's eastern border intending to slow the Mongol advance and obstruct their movement. However, the Mongols possessed specialized units who cleared the paths with great rapidity, removing the obstacles in just 3 days. Combined with the extreme speed of the Mongol advance, called \"lightning\" by a European observer, the Hungarians lacked time to properly group their forces.\n\nIn 1223, the expanding Mongol Empire defeated a group of semi-allied Rus city states at the Kalka River using their famous tactic of the feigned retreat under Subutai and Jebe. This was part of their great cavalry raid to explore the lands beyond their knowledge under the direction of Genghis Khan. \nThe defeated princes of Rus that were captured by the Mongols were crushed alive under a victory platform following the battle. At this time, the Mongols were purely an expeditionary force in Europe, and did not lay siege unto major cities such as Kiev until decades later under the direction of Genghis Khan’s successor, Ogedei. \n\nHungary had tried to convert the Cumans to Christianity and expand its influence over them for several decades beforehand. The Hungarian King Béla IV even began to use the title \"King of Cumania\". When Cuman refugees (ca. 40,000 people) sought refuge in his kingdom after being crushed by the Mongols, it seemed that at least a portion of the Cumans had accepted Hungarian rule. The Mongols saw Hungary as a rival, and the Cuman migration to Hungary as a casus belli. In their ultimatum they also blamed Hungary for \"missing envoys\".\n\nThe Mongolian threat appeared during a time of political turmoil in Hungary. Traditionally, the base of royal power consisted of vast estates owned as royal property. Under King Andrew II, donations of land to nobles by the crown reached a new peak: whole counties were donated. As Andrew II said, \"The best measure of royal generosity is measureless\". After Béla IV inherited his father's throne he began to reconfiscate Andrew’s donations and to execute or expel his advisers. He also denied the nobles' right of personal hearings and accepted only written petitions to his chancellery. He even had the chairs of the council chamber taken away in order to force everybody to stand in his presence. His actions caused great disaffection among the nobles. The newly arrived and grateful Cumans gave the king more power (and increased prestige with the Church for converting them) but also caused more friction. The nomadic Cumans did not easily integrate with the settled Hungarians and the nobles were shocked that the king supported the Cumans in quarrels between the two.\n\nKing Béla began to mobilise his army and ordered all of his troops, including the Cumans, to the city of Pest. Frederick II, Duke of Austria and Styria, also arrived there to help him. At this moment, the conflict between Cumans and Hungarians caused riots and the Cuman khan—who had been under the personal protection of the king—was murdered. Some sources mention the role of Duke Frederick in inciting this riot, but his true role is unknown. Another possibility is that Mongol spies helped spread rumors of the supposed Cuman-Mongol alliance to cause panic, similar to what the Mongols had done in the invasion of Khwarezm. The Cumans believed that they had been betrayed, and left the country to the south, pillaging all the way. The full mobilisation was unsuccessful; many contingents were unable to reach Pest; some were destroyed by Mongols before they arrived, some by renegade Cumans. Many nobles refused to take part in the campaign because they hated the king and desired his downfall. The loss of the Cumans was painful for Béla, because they were the one army in Europe who had experience fighting the Mongols.\n\nThe Mongol vanguard reached Pest on 15 March and began to pillage the neighbouring area. King Béla forbade his men to attack them, as the Hungarian army was still unprepared. Even so, Duke Frederick attacked and defeated a minor raiding party and used this to attempt to smear Bela as a coward. After this \"heroic\" act, Duke Frederick returned home, abandoning his Hungarian rival. Meanwhile, the Mongols had destroyed several other Hungarian forces that were unable to link up with the main army in time. Ugrin Csák, Archbishop of Kalocsa, also tried to attack a Mongol contingent, but he was lured to a swamp and his armoured cavalry became irretrievably stuck in it. He barely escaped with his life. The army of the Count Palatine also was annihilated, as previously mentioned. The southern Mongol army also defeated another Hungarian force at Nagyvárad.\n\nFinally, the king decided to offer the Mongols battle, but they began to retreat. This affirmed the opinion of the nobles that the Mongols were not a threat and the king’s behaviour was not cautious but cowardly. After a week of forced marches and frequent Mongol attacks, the Hungarian army, a collection of varied Hungarian forces, reached the flooded River Sajó. The size of the Hungarian army is unknown. The closest hard evidence comes from the Epternacher Notiz, a contemporary account of the battle by a German chronicler which reported that the Hungarians lost 10,000 men, suggesting their whole army was around that size. For the Mongols, the closest hard evidence comes from the works of Rashid al-Din, drawing on Mongol sources, which report that the Mongol force for the entire Central European invasion was 40,000 horsemen, of which only a portion were actually at Mohi.\n\nFor their part the Mongols claimed their enemy outnumbered them, with Juvaini (drawing on Mongol sources) reporting that the Mongol reconnaissance force (10,000 men) estimated the Hungarian army was twice as numerous as the Mongol army. However, a clearly exaggerated estimate of 400,000 for the Hungarian army was provided, implying 200,000 Mongol troops. Juvaini's wording also implied that the Hungarian host was mostly mounted. Hungarian chroniclers claimed that the Mongols were superior numerically many times over, though they also give unlikely figures, with one chronicler stating that the Mongols invaded with 500,000 troops.\n\nThe Hungarians stopped to rest and to wait for additional supplies, but because of the wooded terrain on the far bank of the Sajó the king and the Hungarians still did not know that the main Mongol army which numbered around 20,000 was present. The cautious king ordered the building of a heavily fortified camp of wagons, a battle-tested countermeasure against nomadic armies.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the Mongols originally wanted to cross a wide and dangerous river to attack a fortified camp. It is more likely that their original plan was to ambush the Hungarians while crossing the river, as in the Battle of the Kalka River, although this is still not certain. A Ruthenian slave of the Mongols escaped to the Hungarians and warned them that the Mongols intended a night attack over the bridge over the Sajó. The Mongols planned to bring their three contingents together if possible before engaging in battle and watched for signs that the Hungarians planned to attack. Though effective against traditional nomadic armies, the Hungarian camp became a liability due to the Mongols' advanced siege equipment.\n\nThe Hungarians still did not believe that there would be a full-scale attack, but the troops of the King's brother Coloman, Duke of Slavonia, and Archbishop Ugrin Csák with Rembald de Voczon, the Templar master, left the camp to surprise the Mongols and defend the unguarded bridge. The Mongol force at the bridge was a vanguard sent by Batu to secure it during the night. They reached the bridge at midnight, having marched the last seven kilometres in darkness. It is very unlikely that the Mongols wanted to attack at night (horse archers avoid night battles), but they wanted to cross the river to be able to attack the Hungarian camp at dawn.\n\nWhen Coloman and Ugrin arrived they found the Mongols unprepared and in the middle of crossing the bridge. They successfully forced them into battle and achieved a victory there. The Mongols had been unprepared for the crossbowmen, who had inflicted considerable losses on them, helped by the size of the bridge, which was a minimum of 200 meters long. The Mongol vanguard was killed nearly to a man, with Thomas of Split writing: \"the Hungarians immediately charged into them and did battle. They cut down a great many of them and pushed the rest back over the bridge, causing them to be drowned in the river.\" The Hungarians left some soldiers to guard the bridge and returned to the camp, unaware that the main Mongol army was nearby. Arriving at the camp at around 02:00, they celebrated their victory.\n\nThe unexpected Hungarian victory forced the Mongol generals to modify their plans. Sejban was sent north to a ford with a smaller force to cross the river and attack the rear of the bridge-guard. At about 04:00, as daylight started to break, they began the crossing. Meanwhile, Subutai went south to build a makeshift emergency bridge while the Hungarians were engaged at the main bridge, but left Batu a plan to use giant stone throwers to clear the crossbowmen opposing them. At dawn, Batu, with the help of seven stone throwers, attacked the Hungarian guards on the bridge. When Sejban and his men arrived, the Hungarians retreated to their camp. The Mongol main forces finished crossing the river around 08:00.\n\nWhen the fleeing Hungarians arrived at the camp they woke the others. Coloman, Ugrin and the Templar master then left the camp again to deal with the attackers. Others remained there, believing this was also a minor attack and that Coloman would again be victorious. But as Coloman and Ugrin witnessed the horde of Mongols swell, they realised that this was not a minor raid but an attack by the main Mongol force. After some heavy fighting they returned to the camp hoping to mobilise the full army. They were badly disappointed, as the King had not even issued orders to prepare for the battle. Archbishop Ugrin reproached the King for his faults in public. Finally the Hungarian army sallied forth, but this delay gave Batu enough time to finish the crossing.\n\nA hard struggle ensued. The Hungarians outnumbered Batu's detachment, and the Mongols were unable to move quickly because the Sajó was behind their backs. In this fighting, Batu lost thirty of his baatars (heavily armoured bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants, Bakatu, when he personally assaulted a strong point with the vanguard. The struggle seemed to be going terribly for the Mongols; in two hours of fighting, they suffered grievous losses, and were just barely saved from being routed by a charge of Hungarian knights by the firepower of their siege engines. At the end of the second hour, as the Hungarians were preparing another charge to shatter the Mongol lines, Subutai, who had been delayed by bridge-building, attacked the Hungarians’ rear flank. The Hungarians retreated back to their fortified camp before Subutai could complete his encirclement. Because of the losses suffered and the size of the surviving Hungarian force, Batu suggested a withdrawal. He was no longer confident that his men could defeat the Hungarians if they decided to come out again, and blamed Subutai for the terrible casualties his wing took. Subutai stated that regardless of Batu's decision, he would not retreat until his force reached Pest. Batu was eventually persuaded and resumed the attack.\n\nConfined within the camp, mood among the Hungarians turned to panic after their sallies were ineffective and they sustained repeated bombardments by stone and gunpowder. Terrified by the flaming arrows, the trampling crush of their comrades resulted in the deaths of many soldiers. The nobles inside the camp felt little loyalty to the king, and likely would have deserted had they not already been surrounded. Béla's brother, Coloman, rallied enough men to sally out and charge the Mongols, but his attack was driven back. The Mongols used their siege equipment to pound the camp's fortifications, and set fire to the tents. Finally, the demoralized soldiers decided to flee. They tried to escape through a gap left open on purpose by the Mongols, because fleeing soldiers can be killed more easily than those who, with their backs to a wall, are forced to fight to the death. There, almost all of them were slaughtered.\n\nArchbishop Ugrin was killed along with another archbishop, three bishops, and numerous other high officials, but Coloman and Béla managed to escape—though Coloman's wounds were so serious that he died soon after. While the Mongols had suffered higher than normal casualties themselves, the Hungarians had lost almost their entire force. Thomas of Spalato, who interviewed many eyewitnesses, claimed that the route the Hungarians tried to flee along was strewn with so many corpses that the ground had become dyed red from their blood.\n\nSeveral modern historians have speculated that Chinese firearms and gunpowder weapons were deployed by the Mongols at the Battle of Mohi. According to William H. McNeill, Chinese gunpowder weapons may have been used in Hungary at that time. Other sources mention weapons like \"flaming arrows\" and \"naphtha bombs\". Professor Kenneth Warren Chase credits the Mongols with introducing gunpowder and its associated weaponry into Europe.\n\nWith the royal army destroyed at Mohi, the Mongols now had free rein over much of the country. The town of Pest was taken and burnt down. Esztergom was attacked and most of its population killed, though the Mongols failed to obtain significant loot on part of the citadel holding against their attacks. The Mongols systematically occupied the Great Hungarian Plains, the slopes of the northern Carpathian Mountains, and Transylvania. Where they found local resistance, they ruthlessly killed the population. Where the locale offered no resistance, they forced the men into servitude in the Mongol army. Hungary lay in ruins, and widespread hysteria spread across all of Europe. Nearly half of the inhabited places had been destroyed by the invading armies. Around 15 to 25 percent of the population was lost, mostly in lowland areas, especially in the Alföld, in the southern reaches of the Hungarian plain in the area now called the Banat, and in southern Transylvania.\n\nWith no safe place left in Hungary, Béla was chased down to Dalmatia. The royal family finally escaped to Austria to seek help from Béla's archenemy Duke Frederick who arrested them, extorted an enormous ransom in gold and forced the king to cede three western counties to Austria. It was at this point that King Béla and some of his retinue fled southwest, through Hungarian-controlled territory, to the Adriatic coast and the island fortress of Trogir, where they stayed until the Mongols withdrew. The Mongols seized the Hungarian royal seal and used it to issue bogus decrees that kept many Hungarians vulnerable to exploitation. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe was horrified by the defeat and subsequent devastation of Hungary, creating a wave of fear and panic that spread to the Atlantic.\n\nSurviving members of the royal retinue, being for the most part those who hadn't arrived at the battle of Mohi in time to participate, along with a number of disorganized irregulars consisting mostly of armed peasants, employed guerrilla tactics to harass the Mongol troops, occasionally engaging them in open battle. However, these attempts were met by massacres by the ruthless Subutai, which stalled any guerrilla attempts in their tracks. A portion of the civilian population fled to areas of refuge difficult for the Mongol cavalry to access: high mountains in the north and east, swamps (especially on the Puszta, around Székesfehérvár and in the west, the Hanság), and older earthwork fortresses (most of which were in a motte-and-bailey form or consisted of a mud-banked enclosure on the top of a mountain, steep natural hill or man-made hill). Rogerius recounts his experience in one such refuge called Fátra in his \"Carmen Miserable\". The Mongols often bypassed strong points and devastated the nearby agricultural fields and irrigation systems, which later led to a mass starvation. The most consistent exceptions to this rule were stone castles, which were well-provisioned, hard to take, and left the Mongols little food to forage from the surroundings. Only five stone castles were located east of the Danube, all deep behind Mongol lines; none of them fell.\n\nOn the Mongol side, there were also internal frictions prior to their armies' departure after the battle. The Mongol/Chinese sources portray Batu as being a mediocre commander-in-chief who blamed Subutai for the losses at Mohi that actually occurred due to Batu's impetuosity. Batu was notably unhappy that he had lost 30+ of his baatars/ba'aturs, and one of his commanders, Bakatu, in addition to anywhere from many hundred to several thousand other soldiers, an unusually high loss for the Mongols. This led to a heated post-victory banquet where Batu was forced to back down and credit their victories to Subutai. Additionally, Güyük and Büri accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails to victory, which led to Batu ejecting the two princes and sending them along with Möngke, likely as an eyewitness, back to Karakorum to be judged by Ögödei. It is highly likely that they also took their own forces with them, further depleting the active Mongol army. \n\nSeemingly relaying a Mongol version of the story meant to glorify Batu Khan, John of Plano Carpini also stated that a great many Mongols were killed in Hungary and Poland and that they would have retreated at a critical moment at Mohi if not for the inspiring leadership of Batu, who personally rallied his men to lead them to a decisive victory. This is somewhat consistent with the Yuan Shi's version of the events, where the Mongols nearly retreated from Hungary partway through the battle, cautious of the enemy's strength, but in that version it was Subutai who ultimately got them to stay, not Batu.\n\nAfter their victory, the Mongols did not pause to loot and instead ruthlessly pursued the remainder of the Hungarian army. After wiping up any stragglers they could find, they began an assault on the Hungarian country, solidifying their control over the terrain they had previously blitzed through. The Hungarians' losses were such that they were unable to mount an effective defence. A near-contemporary source reports that 10,000 Hungarian soldiers were killed, almost the entire army. There are no reliable estimates for Mongol casualties; modern historians give estimates ranging from several hundred to several thousand. The exact losses the Mongols took at Mohi are unknown, though they were considerable; Carpini witnessed a large cemetery in Russia exclusively for the Mongol troops killed in the campaign against Hungary, as he was told \"many lost their lives there.\"\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1879 and served by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Since 1969 it has been administered by the Society of Jesus on behalf of the Archdiocese of Toronto. It is located at 520 Sherbourne Street in Downtown Toronto. It was designed by Frederick Charles Law who modelled the church on the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. In 1986, it was given a centennial plaque by Heritage Toronto.\n\nThe church was founded in 1879. During that time the area was known as St. John’s Grove and was the site of the Archbishop of Toronto’s summer residence. In 1885, on the 25th anniversary of the episcopal ordination of John Joseph Lynch, the Archbishop of Toronto, the clergy of the archdiocese created a church next to the summer residence as a gift to the archbishop.\n\nThe church was designed by Frederick Charles Law and he built it in the Romanesque revival architectural style. He drew inspiration for the church's design on the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome. Part of the summer residence of the archbishop still exists as it forms part of the church's parish hall. On 28 October 1886 the church was opened.\n\nIn 1910, alterations were made to the church. The nave was added and the church of the summer residence became the sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes' Church.\n\nOver time the area changed dramatically and became a united, diversified, and a multicultural community in the Toronto Centre District. The biggest change was the creation of the St. James Town Community Projects. The church was originally affiliated with the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, but, in part because these changes, the church was handed over to the Jesuits in 1969.\n\nSt. James Town is mostly populated by immigrants, foreign workers, international students, and tourists from different countries with various traditions and cultures and these groups form the majority of the parishioners who are from all walks of life.

Singer Daniel Neet has been the only constant member throughout the band's history, providing lyrics and a frontman persona, while an ever-changing lineup of musicians shaped the sound of the band as its style evolved from American cold wave to post-grunge rock.\n\nForming in 1989 as \"Clay People\", the band debuted with the 1991 EP \"Toy Box\" before signing to Re-Constriction Records and issuing their debut album \"Firetribe\" in May 1993. Clay People's second EP \"The Iron Icon\" and studio album \"Stone-Ten Stitches\" followed in 1995 and 1997 respectively. The group added \"The\" to their name with the release of their 1998 self-titled album, marking a change in direction from their dance club roots to a live rock band with a lineup featuring Neet, Brian McGarvey (guitar), Mike Guzzardi (guitar), D. Patrick Walsh (bass) and Dan Dinsmore (drums). The album was produced by Neil Kernon for Slipdisc Records and was the band's most successful release. Songs from the record were included in the soundtracks to the films Strangeland and .\n\nInternal conflicts caused the band to go on hiatus in the early 2000s as members pursued solo and side projects or launched new bands. A new album from The Clay People, Waking the Dead, was released on May 22, 2007 via Overit Records with a lineup featuring only Neet, Dinsmore and McGarvey from the 1998 band. Along with the new release was a music video for the album's first single, Supersonic Overdrive. Metroland, the local Albany weekly newspaper, featured the band on their front page as “The Return Of The Claypeople” following the album release and a successful performance at Edgefest, a local radio station music festival. Shortly following the release of Waking the Dead the band once again become inactive.\n\nIn June 2012 Neet, McGarvey, and Dinsmore revived The Clay People to perform at the Cold Waves festival: The Jamie Duffy Memorial Concert\" in Chicago in honor of the guitarist from Acumen Nation who took his own life earlier that year.\nThe Clay People began recording again, however continuing internal conflicts and ongoing problems associated with substance abuse led to more band member lineup changes and an unfinished album as of five years later.\nThe Clay People released a new album, Demon Hero, featuring a revolving-door of recording musicians in September 2018. They began to play shows in the Albany, New York area again citing their “return” as a band.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This provision is codified in Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (). It also authorizes incurring deficiencies for costs of additional members of the Armed Forces on active duty-beyond the number for which funds are currently provided in DoD appropriations (Title 10 U.S.C.).\n\nThis authority requires Congressional notification and does not permit actual expenditures until Congress provides an appropriation of the required funds.\n\nThe act has been amended over time and now reads in part:\n\nNo contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made, unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment, except in the Department of Defense ... for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, or medical and hospital supplies, which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of the current year...\n\nIt has been invoked on a number of occasions to deal with emergencies.\n\n\nThere is a controversy over whether, and the extent to which, the Act lets a President fund military operations for which Congress has not appropriated funds.\n\nIn November 2006, member of Congress and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich wrote that the President could cite the Act to continue the Iraq War even if Congress withheld funds.\nIn response, OmbWatch.org published \"\"Exploring the Scope of the Feed and Forage Act of 1861\"\" suggesting a more limited interpretation:\n\n... interpreting the Feed and Forage Act broadly probably gives great flexibility to Department of Defense officials to obtain anything they deem necessary, so long as it is for a short-term need that occurred in an emergency, could not be feasibly obtained through normal procedures, and was used in the fiscal year in which it was obtained. This interpretation would give Congress and the president much more, if not unlimited, time to negotiate a compromise...\n\nOthers have argued that the Act cannot allow the President to continue military operations where Congress has used its Power of the purse to end them. It is argued that the intent of the Framers was that \"\"the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the LEGISLATURE, not in the EXECUTIVE\"\"\n\nThe Department of Defense's Financial Management Regulations notes that : \"\"The Department shall limit its use of the authority in 41 U.S.C 11 to emergency circumstances.\"\" \n\nMany sources refer to a \"Food and Forage Act\" but the name used by the U.S. Government is \"Feed and Forage Act\".\n"}

{"id": "1815726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815726", "title": "I Will Always Love You", "text": "I Will Always Love You\n\n\"I Will Always Love You\" is a song written and originally recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. Her country version of the track was released in 1974 as a single and was written as a farewell to her former partner and mentor of seven years, Porter Wagoner, following Parton's decision to leave \"The Porter Wagoner Show\" and pursue a solo career.\n\nParton's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" was a commercial success. It reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart twice. It first reached number one in June 1974, and then in October 1982, with her re-recording on the soundtrack of the movie version of \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\" Thus, she achieved a number one position twice with the same song, a rare feat that Chubby Checker had done previously with \"The Twist\" becoming number one in 1960 and again in 1962.\n\nWhitney Houston recorded her version of the song for the 1992 film \"The Bodyguard\". Her single spent 14 weeks at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and is one of the best-selling singles of all time. It also holds the record for being the best-selling single by a woman in music history. Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" re-entered the charts in 2012 after her death, making it the second single ever to reach the top three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in separate chart runs. The song has been recorded by many other artists including Linda Ronstadt, John Doe, Amber Riley, LeAnn Rimes and Sarah Washington, whose dance version reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nCountry music singer-songwriter Dolly Parton wrote the song in 1973 for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, from whom she was separating professionally after a seven-year partnership. She recorded it in RCA's Studio B in Nashville on June 12, 1973. \"I Will Always Love You\" was issued on March 18, 1974, as the second single from Parton's thirteenth solo studio album, \"Jolene\" (1974). In 1982, Parton re-recorded the song, when it was included on the soundtrack to the film \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\". In addition to the 1982 re-recording for the soundtrack album, Parton's original 1974 recording of the song also appeared in Martin Scorsese's film \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\", and the 1996 film \"It's My Party.\" The song also won Parton Female Vocalist of the Year at the 1975 CMA Awards.\n\nAuthor Curtis W. Ellison stated that the song \"speaks about the breakup of a relationship between a man and a woman that does not descend into unremitting domestic turmoil, but instead envisions parting with respect – because of the initiative of the woman\". According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the country love track is set in a time signature of common time with a tempo of 66 beats per minute. (Larghetto/Adagio) Although Parton found much success with the song, many people are unaware of its origin; during an interview, Parton's manager Danny Nozel said that \"one thing we found out from \"American Idol\" is that most people don't know that Dolly Parton wrote [the track]\". During an interview on The Bobby Bones Show, Dolly Parton revealed that she wrote her signature song \"Jolene\" on the same day that she wrote \"I Will Always Love You.\"\n\nSeveral times (long before Whitney Houston recorded the song), Dolly Parton suggested to singer Patti Labelle that she record \"I Will Always Love You\" because she felt Patti could have sung it so well. However, Patti admitted she kept putting off the opportunity to do so and later deeply regretted it after she heard Whitney Houston's rendition.\n\nDuring its original release in 1974, \"I Will Always Love You\" reached number four in Canada on the Canadian \"RPM\" Country Tracks chart and peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart, becoming one of the best selling singles of 1974.\n\nWhen Parton re-recorded the song in 1982 for the soundtrack of the film \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", the track was issued as a single and once again charted at number one on Hot Country Songs — making her the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song. The 1982 version also reached number 53 on Billboard's Hot 100 and number 17 on its adult contemporary charts. Parton's recording has sold 489,000 digital copies since becoming available for download.\n\nParton recorded a duet with Vince Gill in 1995 for the album \"Something Special\", the duet version of \"I Will Always Love You\" made the \"Billboard\" country chart and peaked at number 15. Parton and Gill were awarded the CMA's \"Vocal Event of the Year\" award in 1996 for their recording of the song. Another duet version of the song was released in 2017 with Michael Bolton from his album Songs of Cinema.\n\nWhen the 1974 recording of the song was reaching number one on the country charts, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded. Parton refused. She recalls:I said, 'I'm really sorry,' and I cried all night. I mean, it was like the worst thing. You know, it's like, Oh, my God … Elvis Presley.' And other people were saying, 'You're nuts. It's Elvis Presley.' ...I said, 'I can't do that. Something in my heart says, 'Don't do that. And I just didn't do it... He would have killed it. But anyway, so he didn't. Then when Whitney [Houston's version] came out, I made enough money to buy Graceland.\n\nIn Curtis W. Ellison's book, \"Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven\" (1995), he stated: \"In the early 1990s, when ambiguity in romantic relationships accompanies changing expectations for both men and women, this song demonstrates Dolly Parton's appeal as a songwriter in the pop music market.\" Ken Knight, author of \"The Midnight Show: Late Night Cable-TV \"Guy-Flicks\" of the '80s\" (2008), commented that Parton is the only singer who can sing \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"make it memorable\". Writer Paul Simpson criticized the singer, stating that the track was only written to \"soften the blow\" of Parton and Wagoner's split.\n\n\nParton recorded the song in 1982 for \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" soundtrack. It was released on July 12, 1982, as the first single from the soundtrack. It would eventually peak at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart, thus Parton reached the number one position twice with the same song, a rare feat that Chubby Checker had previously achieved when \"The Twist\" reached number one in 1960 and again in 1962.\n\n\"Billboard\" gave a positive review which said, \"The first single from \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" isn't the sort of brassy main theme normally used to launch a major movie musical: here Parton reinterprets one of her earliest exercises in pure pop writing, and while older fans may be divided over the breathier, more stylized reading she offers here, the song itself is still a lovely ballad with a soaring chorus.\"\n\n\"Cashbox\" also reviewed the single favorably, saying that \"hoisted over a building arrangement, Parton’s vocals have never been more convincing or moving. The single choice from her Hollywood flick, \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", the tune is sentiment wrapped in an appropriate package replete with strings, oboe and harp in addition to a delicate rhythm section.\"\n\nParton recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" in 1995 as a duet with Vince Gill for her album, \"Something Special\". Following an August 26 performance of the duet at the Grand Ole Opry which aired on TNN, radio stations began giving the duet unsolicited airplay, causing it to debut on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart at number 53. After a performance at the 29th Annual CMA Awards, the song was officially released as a single in November 1995, peaking at number 15. This marked the third time Parton had a top 20 hit with the song. The song was nominated at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals and was named Vocal Event of the Year at the 30th Annual CMA Awards.\n\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\n\n\nIn 1992, R&B singer Whitney Houston recorded a new arrangement of \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack to \"The Bodyguard\", her film debut. The song has a saxophone solo by Kirk Whalum. She was originally to record Jimmy Ruffin's \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" as the lead single from \"The Bodyguard\". However, when it was discovered the song was to be used for \"Fried Green Tomatoes\", Houston requested a different song. It was her co-star Kevin Costner who suggested \"I Will Always Love You\", playing her Linda Ronstadt's 1975 version from her album \"Prisoner in Disguise\". Producer David Foster and Houston re-arranged the song as a soul ballad. Her record company did not feel a song with an a cappella introduction would be as successful; however, Houston and Costner insisted on retaining it. When Parton heard that Houston was using Ronstadt's recording as a template, she called Foster to give him the final verse, which was missing from the Ronstadt recording, as she felt it was important to the song.\n\nWhitney Houston's recording is not the only version of the song featured in the movie. In a scene where she dances with Kevin Costner, a version by John Doe can be heard playing on a jukebox.\n\nHouston's version appears at No. 9 on \"NME\"s Greatest No 1 Singles in History list. In 2004, Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" finished at No. 65 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. It was also ranked at number 22 on \"The Guardian's\" list of Britain's favorite 100 songs, published in May 2002. In January 2013, Whitney's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" has sold over 20 million worldwide, making it the best-selling song by a female artist of all time as well as one of the best-selling songs of all time.\n\nIn February 2014, the song was placed at number six on \"Billboard\" list of the Top 50 'Love' Songs of All Time.\n\nA live performance was included on the 1999 release \"Divas Live '99\", and on the 2014 CD/DVD release of \"\", a 1994 performance of the song was included as well.\n\nHer version can also be heard at the start of 2019 film \"\". The song is also included in the soundtrack of the 2013 movie \"This is the end\".\n\nHouston's version was later called her \"signature song\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said it was a \"magnificent rendition\", commentingHouston transforms a plaintive country ballad into a towering pop-gospel assertion of lasting devotion to a departing lover. Her voice breaking and tensing, she treats the song as a series of emotional bursts in a steady climb toward a final full-out declamation. Along the way, her virtuosic gospel embellishments enhance the emotion and never seem merely ornamental.Writing for \"USA Today\" on November 17, 1992, James T. Jones IV called it a \"tour-de-force\", and added \"[Houston] gives a 3-star [out of four] performance. Where Dolly Parton's original 'I Will Always Love You' was plaintive and tear- stained, Houston's is gospel-infused and dramatic.\" Chris Willman of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated: \"Houston has the goods to deliver on the tune's haunting beauty and resists overpowering it – until the finale, when the key change and stratospheric notes drain all the heart-rending sadness out of the song and make it sound like just another anthem of survival.\" Amy Linden of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote Houston's version \"is artistically satisfying and uncharacteristically hip for the MOR songbird.\" Stewart Mason of AllMusic found Houston's cover \"repulsively overwrought... so boomingly bombastic and glutinous with self-approbation that the tenderness of Dolly Parton's song is lost in the mire\".\n\nThe single spent 14 weeks at the top of the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, which at the time was a record. It became Houston's longest run at number one, surpassing her previous record of three weeks with the \"Greatest Love of All\" in 1986. It is also the longest running number one single from a soundtrack album.\n\nIt debuted at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and became Houston's tenth number one entry two weeks later. It also dominated other \"Billboard\" charts, spending 14 weeks at the top of \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Single Sales chart, and 11 weeks at number one on its Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song also remained at number one for five weeks on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and for 11 weeks on the Hot R&B Singles chart becoming the longest running number one on the R&B charts at the time; it remained in the top 40 for 24 weeks. It became Arista Records' biggest hit. The song was number one on the Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, and R&B chart simultaneously for a record-equaling five weeks; Ray Charles' \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" in 1962 achieved the same feat on the same charts.\n\nThe song stayed at number one in the United States throughout January and February 1993, making it the first time \"Billboard\" did not rank a new number one single until March of the new year. Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" was also the year-end single of 1993 in the US. Similarly, in the UK, Houston's version was ranked the number one single of 1992, and then made the countdown again in 1993 where it was ranked number nine, marking the first time any artist or group had the same single ranked in the top 10 of the year-end review two years in a row. In Australia, it was the number 17 single of 1992 and the number two song of 1993.\n\nHouston's single was also an international success, peaking at number one of the singles charts in many countries, including the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles, where it spent 13 weeks at the top. The single ruled the summit position for ten weeks in Australia, five weeks in Austria, seven weeks for Belgium, eight weeks in France, six weeks in Germany, eight weeks in Ireland, two weeks in Italy, six weeks in Netherlands, 14 weeks in New Zealand, nine weeks in Norway, one week in Spain, six weeks in Sweden, eight weeks in Switzerland, and ten weeks in the United Kingdom. Houston's 10-week reign in the UK was the longest run at the top by a solo female artist in the history of the British singles chart, until it was overtaken by Tones & I in 2019.\n\nOnly a few hours after Houston's death on February 11, 2012, \"I Will Always Love You\" topped the US iTunes charts. Also, in the week following her death, the single returned to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 after almost 20 years, debuting at number 7, and becoming a posthumous top-ten single for Houston, the first one since 2001. The song eventually peaked at No. 3, two spots shy of becoming the first song to return to the No. 1 position after falling off the chart since \"The Twist\" by Chubby Checker. It debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot Digital Singles Chart at number 3 on the chart dated February 25, 2012, with over 195,000 copies downloaded. In the United Kingdom, the song charted at number 10 the week of Houston's death.\n\nHouston's single sold approximately 400,000 copies in its second week at the top of the charts, making it the best-selling song in a single week surpassing Bryan Adams' \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\". It broke its own record in the following three weeks, peaking at 632,000 copies in the week ending December 27, 1992. The January 9, 1993 issue of \"Billboard\" reported it had broken its own record for most copies sold in a single week for any song in the Nielsen SoundsScan era. This record was broken by Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997/Something About the Way You Look Tonight\", which sold 3.4 million in the final week of September 1997. \"I Will Always Love You\" was certified four times Platinum in the US for shipments of over 4 million copies by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 12, 1993, making Houston the first female artist with a single to reach that level in RIAA history. According to Nielsen SoundScan, as of 2009, the single had sold 4,591,000 copies, and had become the second best-selling physical single in US alone, only behind Elton John's single in 1997.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single sold over 1,550,000 copies, becoming the tenth best-selling single of the 1990s, and was certified two times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on January 1, 1993. It was certified Platinum for shipments of over 500,000 copies by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) in Germany. In Japan, \"I Will Always Love You\" sold over 810,000 copies, staying for 27 weeks on the chart, and became the best-selling single by a foreign female artist at the time, despite not topping the charts.\n\n\"I Will Always Love You\" won the 1994 Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, her third award for this category after earlier awards in 1986 and 1988. During the Grammy Award telecast, the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female was presented to Houston by composer Dolly Parton and David Foster. The single topped the 1993 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles year-end charts simultaneously, becoming the first single by a female artist and the second overall to achieve that feat behind Prince's \"When Doves Cry\" in 1984. In addition, it received Favorite Pop/Rock Single and Favorite Soul/R&B Single awards at the 21st American Music Awards, which was the first record by a solo female artist to win both categories, and the third overall in AMA history behind \"Endless Love\" by Lionel Richie & Diana Ross in 1982 and \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson in 1984. \"I Will Always Love You\" won two Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1993 for International Song of the Year, and a 1994 International Song of the Year Special Award for Japanese sales of over one million units.\n\nIn 2015, \"I Will Always Love You\" was named the No. 1 Song of the Rock Era in the book \"The Top 500 Songs of the Rock Era: 1955-2015\".\n\nIn 2020, \"I Will Always Love You\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nAfter Whitney Houston's recording of the song became a hit in 1992, the tabloid press began reporting on a 'feud' between the two performers, stemming from Dolly Parton allegedly reneging on an agreement that she would not perform the song for a number of months while Houston's version was on the charts, so as not to compete with Houston's recording. However, both Parton and Houston dispelled any rumors, speaking glowingly of one another in interviews. Houston praised Parton for writing a beautiful song. In return, Parton thanked Houston for bringing her song to a wider audience and increasing the amount of royalties for her song in the process. Dolly Parton also gave a live interview, confirming this.\n\nWhen Houston won the Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female award at the 1994 Grammy Awards for the recording, Parton (along with David Foster) presented her with the award.\n\nIn a statement to \"Billboard\" on the day of Houston's death in February 2012, Parton said:Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'\n\nThe single's music video is credited to Alan Smithee (Nick Brandt removed his name due to the way Clive Davis re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins with the performance of the song Houston gives at the end of \"The Bodyguard\". The video then cuts to Houston in a dark blue suit sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love, and at the end of the video, Houston's theater changes into open camp circled by snow, which is meant to be at Fallen Leaf Lake, California, where The Bodyguard's boat scene was filmed. The video is inter-cut with scenes from \"The Bodyguard\" and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with the singer. At the time of the video's shooting Houston was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina, so Houston is shown only sitting in the theater scenes.\n\n'UK / Europe 12\" vinyl single\n\nUK / Europe / US 7\" vinyl single\nUS / Europe Maxi-CD single\n\nMaxi-CD singles (1999 Remixes)\n\n\nAll-time charts\n\"Billboard\" Magazine Hot 100 Anniversary Charts\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Digital\n\nJennifer Hudson performed the song in front of Houston, who received The BET Honors Award for Entertainer Lifetime Achievement spanning over 25 years in the industry. The 2010 BET Honors Awards was held at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010.\nSince Houston's death in 2012, many other artists have performed tributes to the late singer's version of the song, including on February 12, 2012, when Hudson performed the song as a tribute during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, the day after Houston's death, alongside images of musicians who had died in 2011 and 2012, including Amy Winehouse and Etta James. The song was played at Houston's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church. Parton complimented Hudson on her performance, saying,I was brought to tears again last night, as I'm sure many were, when Jennifer Hudson sang \"I Will Always Love You\" on the Grammys in memory of Whitney. Like everybody else, I am still in shock. But I know that Whitney will live forever in all the great music that she left behind. I will always have a very special piece of her in the song we shared together and had the good fortune to share with the world. Rest in peace, Whitney. Again, we will always love you.\n\nIn 2012, following Whitney Houston's death, American singer Beyoncé performed a tribute to Houston during her revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey at the Revel resort. She began the performance of her song \"Halo\" singing the first verse of \"I Will Always Love You\" a cappella.\n\nLater, in 2013, during her The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, Beyoncé also sang the opening lines of \"I Will Always Love You\" prior to the performance of \"Halo\" as the final song of the tour. At the 2017 Commencement of the University of Southern California, Will Ferrell sang \"I Will Always Love You\" to the graduating class. See Washington Post commentary:\n\nBritish pop, electronic dance and Hi-NRG singer Sarah Washington released a successful dance-cover of \"I Will Always Love You\" in 1993. It became her highest charting hit to date, reaching number 3 in Spain, number 12 in the United Kingdom, number 15 in Ireland and number 32 in Sweden. On the Eurochart Hot 100, it peaked at number 44 in September 1993.\n\nThe remake was released on Almighty Records, which described Washington as \"an eager young hopeful\" and cited her \"sensational studio performance\" as being key to the ultimate success of the track, also giving credit to London radio station 95.8 Capital FM and its heavy rotation of the song. A black-and-white music video was made to accompany the song. In 2006, Almighty Records released an 11-mixes package of \"I Will Always Love You\".\n\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" commented on the song, \"There are no less than nine dance music covers of the Whitney Houston megahit \"I Will Always Love You\". So far, only Sarah Washington's hi-NRG rendering on Almighty Records is worth a spin.\"\n\n\"I Will Always Love You\" was covered by American actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth as a duet with Dolly Parton.

These structures correspond to the embryonic foregut. (Similarly, the superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery feed structures arising from the embryonic midgut and hindgut respectively. Note that these three anterior branches of the abdominal aorta are distinct and cannot substitute for one another, although there are limited connections between their terminal branches.)\n\nThe celiac artery is an essential source of blood, since the interconnections with the other major arteries of the gut are not sufficient to sustain adequate perfusion. Thus it cannot be safely ligated in a living person, and obstruction of the celiac artery will lead to necrosis of the structures it supplies. \n\nThe celiac artery is the only major artery that nourishes the abdominal digestive organs that does \"not\" have a similarly named vein.\n\nMost blood returning from the digestive organs (including from the area of distribution of the celiac artery) is diverted to the liver via the portal venous system for further processing and detoxification in the liver before returning to the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins.\n\nIn contrast to the drainage of midgut and hindgut structures by the superior mesenteric vein and inferior mesenteric vein respectively, venous return from the coeliac artery is through either the splenic vein emptying into the hepatic portal vein or via smaller tributaries of the portal venous system.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815754", "title": "Iliochori", "text": "Iliochori\n\nIliochori (, \"Village of the Sun\", before 1927: Δοβρίνοβο - \"Dovrinovo\" ()) is one of the Zagori villages in northwest Greece. It is located in the municipal unit of Tymfi in the northern part of the regional unit of Ioannina. According to a local legend, the village was founded as \"Rasciana\", on the river of the same name. However, that site was abandoned because of a lack of drinking water, and the inhabitants scattered to found Iliochori and the nearby town of Laista (ancient Lisinitza). Iliochori was traditionally an agricultural village, with husbandry and cultivation of barley and vetch being among its primary areas of economic activity. Viticulture was also prominent, and the village produced a wine, Dobrovino, that gave it its original name. Caravans leaving from Iliochori carried products from the region to the Balkans for trade. The town suffered severe damage in both World War II and the Greek Civil War and lost a large portion of its population during the 1940s as a result.\n\nThe origin of the town is not completely clear. From some historical findings it seems that in the 11th century BC, the local inhabitants formed several small isolated communities, at the sites of Rascianà, Lipochori, Koukourounzu and Souri. Later on, probably for several reasons including drinkable water, the inhabitants abandoned the place and constructed the town in the actual \"Dobrinovo\". That Slavic name, of the AD 14th century, means \"Dobri+novo\" (\"good + new\"). However, not all the inhabitants moved to Iliochori. Some of them settled in Laista (14 km or 9 miles away) that in this period was called Lisinitza. During the period of the Slavic hegemony in the Epirus (AD 6th-7th century), the town of Dobrinovo already existed, as it turns out from the Slavic evidences.\n\nIn the 14th century, the Monastery of Panaghia was constructed. In 1431, as the \"Vrisochoritan\" Nikolaos Exarchos reports in his book \"To Ntombrinovo\", the Turkish administration counts 1180 inhabitants. In the following years, it kept developing either as more inhabitants or as increased prosperity. Evidence shows the existence of a document that contained a convention made with a doctor of Pades in order to offer medical assistance. The convention that in the period of one year established that the municipality of Dobrinovo would have paid only the wage to the doctor in order to offer free medical attendance to the inhabitants, who have only paid for the medicines. The documents were signed in 1616, but they were destroyed with the fire of the municipality by the Nazis in 1943.\n\nIn 1812, the French consul Pouqueville visited the region and reported that in the town of Dobrinovo, he found 750 inhabitants. After few years, since 1815 in Dobrinovo, there was a continuation of Greek schools. Lessons took place in the Monastery of Panaghia and later in some private houses. During the year there happened the first great destruction of the community of the inhabitants caused by bubonic plague disease. The town had numerous victims, and the inhabitants sheltered themselves in the mountains in order to escape from the disease.\n\nIn 1819 the Metropolita of Ioannina Gabriel visited the communities which suffered from the disease, and in the town he met 160 inhabitants. In a letter of Ath. Psalidis dated 12-2-1823, sent to Movrokordatos, he described the situation of the Epirus and Tessally, under the Turkish occupation, showing an armed struggle for liberation. It reports that in the town of Dobrinovo where people live, they were able to carry weapons. The town of Dobrinovo in that period used the school separated for the boys and the girls and was constructed using the aqueduct that brought water to the town and bridges that opened new roads. The inhabitants of Dobrinovo travelled a lot and became traders, but they did not forget their town and they contributed for its development. The Greek newspaper published in Constantinopolis, speaks about 1200 inhabitants in the town of Dobrinovo. Unfortunately for the town, there followed a period of economic decadence. The Balkan wars in 1912, then the First World War, blocked the trade activities that the Iliochorites had created with the countries like Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, until Russia. Later with the arrival of the Spanish flu pulled down on all the towns including Dobrinovo (Iliochori) with numerous victims.\n\nFrom 1463 until 1912, Iliochori was under the dominion of the Turks, who had granted to all the towns of Zagoria a governmental autonomy with the payment of taxes. The town grew rich with the maximum development between 1870 and 1900.\n\nFrom 1916 the population was decimated by \"Asian flu\". The inhabitants of Iliochori lived by breeding sheep and cows, and agriculture, cultivating grain, barley and vetch. They dedicated great care also to viticulture, producing a good wine. However, they were also traders, and in the spring left in caravan with mules and horses, carrying of the goods that they above all sold in the countries of the Balkans, where many had constructed true and economic fortunes. They came back to Iliochori at the end of autumn, to spend the winter with their families. In the winter months, the shepherds were dedicated to the handicrafts, forming itinerant guilds of masons and sculptors in wood that traveled the Balkans selling their goods.\n\nUntil 1914 in Iliochori there was the school of the chassis situated over the road of the current city hall, where the girls learned to weave. The building belonged to the Gianussi family that had donated it to the city council; beyond the weaving school there were the elementary school, the primary and secondary schools that were found in the same building. In these schools, there were female teachers for the girls and male teachers for the boys. In 1912 the building was burnt, and in 1924 started its reconstruction, which was finished in 1927. The first master was Papasisis.\n\nAfter the 1920 the houses inhabited were 160.\nIn 1926, the town officially changed name from \"Dobrinovo\" and was assigned the name \"Iliochori\" that in Greek means \"Town of the Sun\".\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Germans arrived at Iliochori in 1943 and burnt a large part of the houses of the town.\nIn 1944 another battalion of German entered the town, searching carefully without damaging it.\n\nThe town has endured large damages during the Greek Civil War from 1946 to 1949 and many inhabitants emigrated. Till World War II, most Iliochorians used to emigrate mainly to Thessaly. Outside Greece, Iliochorians used to emigrate to Bulgaria, Wallachia and the U.S.\n\nSeems that in 1972, there was filmed an old Greek movie \"Oi Xenitemenoi\".\n\nFrom 1990 many original inhabitants of the place, coming from several parts, Athens, Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Larissa and also from Italy, had begun to repopulate and re-evaluate the town, constructing new houses. In the period, many initiatives of building reconstruction were started, like the renovation of the church of Aghios Nikolaos. In 1992 was completed the portion of the road from the locality Gyftokampos to Iliochori, allowing a fast connection to the village. Always in this period, there was a small committee for the creation of the tourist attraction like waterfall of \"Balta Stringa\", in the locality Rascianà that attracts visitors also from France.\n\nIn 2002, the first website was launched in English and Italian and later became also in French, Spanish and later in Greek version. In 2008 another website in the Greek language was launched, becoming the first village of Zagori in 2009 with two official websites. The door of the church of Aghios Minas had been replaced with a new one in the summer 2009 by the donation of countryman Georgios Polimeris. In October 2009, SKY TV set up a documentary in the waterfall of \"Balta Stringa\" and around Iliochori. In 2010, after many years on the initiative of the Cultural Association Iliochori, \"The Ntomprinovo\" revived, successfully, the reunion of Iliochoriton everywhere in lakes of the pit.\n\nEach 20 July: (Prophet Elia): This holiday is in honour of the Prophet Elia of the Patron Saint of Iliochori. It is a holiday of religion and folklore, in fact the women of the town, a few days in advance, they go to the church situated in front of the town, to prepare it suitably for the holiday. The folklore holiday starts on the evening of 19 July. At the center of the square, the Iliochoriti start the traditional dances of the Epirus, and in particular (peculiar) of the region of Zagori, with the music of the orchestra.\n\nThe morning of 20 July begins the religious holiday: The faithful cover by walking the road that from the town brings to the church of the prophet Elia: at the end of the function; they go to the houses of the people that celebrate the name day for the wishes. Always the same evening on the main square of the town there are again the traditional dances until the first light of the morning. This holiday is occasion of many people originally from this place but living far away, to go back to Iliochori. The holiday attracts many visitors from the towns, eager to taste typical dishes and wines of the region of Zagori.\n\nThe village is located in the municipality of Tymfi, in the northern part of the Ioannina prefecture at from Ioannina, after the locality Gyftokampos. It is built on a steep slope between very tall trees in a green area, with lots of running water and stone bridges. The village of Iliochori also has a small post office and a small school with a nice square re-made as a plaka. Every year during the of Prophet Elia, it has been used to meet and celebrate the feast.\n\nThe village of Iliochori is connected from Ioannina by the transit communications company KTEL (Greece), that is frequently operated. From the other main Greek cities, like Athens and Thessaloniki, the Via Egnatia highway passes by Ioannina. The closer airport is the Ioannina National Airport, going out from Ioannina in the direction of Coniza. After on the right, there is the cross-roads that after will bring to the town of Iliochori.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia\n"}

Its larger tributaries are the Chapare, Secure, Apere, and Yacuma from the west, and the Ichilo, Guapay, Ivari, Manique and Guapore from the east. Taking into account its length only, the Guapay should be considered the upper part of the Mamore; but it is shallow and obstructed, and carries a much smaller volume of water. The Guapore also rivals the Mamore in length and volume, having its source in the Parecis plateau, Mato Grosso, Brazil, a few miles from streams flowing north-ward to the Tapajos and Amazon, and southward to the Paraguay and Paraná rivers. The Mamore is interrupted by rapids a few miles above its junction with the Beni, but a railway 300 km long has been undertaken from below the rapids of the Madeira. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm/sec (2,530 cub. in. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km (9,382 square miles).\n\nAn extensive pre-Columbian civilization existed in the basin of the Mamore River in the swampy area known as the Llanos de Moxos. \n"}

The original name intended for the town was \"Kiryat Moshe\" (\"Town of Moses\" in Hebrew) honoring Baron Maurice Moshe Hirsch, but the land agent who registered the settlement translated it to the French-like \"Moïsesville\" which was later hispanized to the current \"Moisés Ville\". The town is located about from the provincial capital, in the San Cristóbal Department and from Buenos Aires. It had 2,572 inhabitants at the .\nMoises Ville was founded by a group of Russian Jewish colonists who arrived in August 1889 aboard the SS \"Weser\" from Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine. Moises Ville is regarded as the first agricultural Jewish colony in South America, beating by some months a smaller group coming from Bessarabia who established a neighbouring settlement called Monigotes.\n\nIt all started one day in 1887 when leaders of Jewish communities in Podolia and Bessarabia met in Katowice (Silesia, Poland) to seek a solution to their problems. They decided that emigration to Palestine was the solution and chose a delegate, Eliezer Kauffmann, to travel to Paris and meet there the famous Jewish Philanthropist, Baron Edmond James de Rothschild asking for his support.\n\nTwo theories exist on what happened next: Some say the negotiations with the Baron failed while others believe Kauffman wasn't able to meet him. Afraid of going back empty-handed and learning that there was an official bureau of information of the Argentine Republic, Kauffman decided to meet J. B. Frank, the officer in charge, and learned that a gentleman named Rafael Hernández was interested in selling lands to European immigrants. The land was in Nueva Plata, Province of Buenos Aires, near the city of La Plata. A contract was signed there and then and thus the 820 people represented by Kauffman, comprising 130 families (a number equivalent to half the Jewish population of Argentina at that time) began their trip to Argentina on board of the SS \"Weser\".\n\nThey arrived at Buenos Aires on August 14, 1889 and learned right away that the lands they had acquired were not available. Since their agreement the price of the land had more than doubled, making it \"inconvenient\" for unscrupulous Hernández to fulfill the contract. Rabbi Henry Joseph, the leader of Argentine Jewry, tried to save the day and arranged for the newcomers to meet Pedro Palacios, the Jewish Community attorney, who happened to be the owner of vast lands in the Province of Santa Fe, right where the new railway line to Tucumán was being built. Palacios agreed to sell the Weser passengers some land he owned. By late August contracts were signed and the immigrants were on their way. To their dismay the travel was bad and the place they arrived to even worse. The families were lodged in freight cars parked in a shed along the railway line. They expected to be transferred to their fields, get farm animals and agricultural appliances and materials (as established in the contract) but none of these happened. Railway workers distributed food among the hungry children but soon enough a typhus epidemic exacerbated by poor hygiene, took the lives of 64 of them. In a very short time two cemeteries were built, one in Palacios and the other in Monigotes. Those cemeteries in the surroundings of Moises Ville founded the base of the Jewish community and bonded the Jewish immigrants to the land: they made the families stay and not leave the resting place of the deceased unattended.\n\nMeantime, the national authorities, learning of the immigrants' deplorable conditions, ordered an investigation by the General Immigration Commissioner. Luckily for the newcomers, Wilhelm Loewenthal, a Rumanian doctor from the University of Berlin, specializing in bacteriology, who had been hired in Paris by the Argentine government for a scientific mission and also asked by the A.I.U. to keep an eye on the Weser immigrants, traveled to Palacios Train Station where he was astonished by the miserable living conditions of the immigrants. In spite of their ordeal and difficulties the settlers still hoped to become farmers. He reported to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Estanislao Zeballos and simultaneously met Palacios requesting him to comply with his obligations. Back in Paris, Loewenthal submitted a written project to Rabbi Zadoc Kahn for the agricultural colonization of Jewish families in Argentina by means of establishing a Colonizing Association and allocating to each family a farm of 50 to 100 hectares, at the cost of US$2000 per family. If it had not been for the travelers abandoned in Palacios Station it is unlikely that Baron Hirsch would have thought of sending more Jews to Argentina, or created the JCA. But as a result of the ordeal the 1891 Baron Hirsch Plan was born.\n\nWithin the frame of the JCA's program a further group of 42 families from the Province of Grodno arrived to Moises Ville between 1894 and 1895. The colonists settled in villages near Moises Ville, named after the number of houses that formed them: \"The Four Houses\", \"The Six Houses\", \"The Twelve Houses\" and \"The Twenty-four houses\". In 1900, the colonists requested the JCA to enlarge the colony and bring new groups from the Grodno area. The request was conveyed through the colonist Noe Cociovich who, in 1900, 1901 and 1902, carried out several trips to Russia and assembled three groups totaling 104 families that met the JCA demands: they already had relatives in the colony and they paid for their tickets themselves. The groups settled in the Wavelberg area, north of Moises Ville, which had been named for the philanthropist who helped finance the travel; in the Virginia area to the east, and in La Juanita to the west. In 1901, another group of 31 families organized in Białystok (current Poland) arrived, led by the writer and Jewish leader Gdalia Bublik. The area in which this group settled is known as Línea Białystok (Białystok Line). Many of the colonists who settled in La Juanita and Białystok later moved to the town of Las Palmeras. At the same time, a group of Rumanian families selected by the JCA arrived. This group settled in the area of Zadok Kahn, to the west of Moises Ville. It was named in honor of the above-mentioned Chief Rabbi of Paris. Most of the colonists in that group that remained also eventually moved to Las Palmeras. Dr. Guillermo Lowenthal heard that plans were made to move the settlement to two new locations in the Province of Entre Rios. The Moises Villenses refused: they did not want to leave the place where they were already building a third cemetery to bury the first victim of an attack by gauchos. At the meeting in the synagogue, they decided to stay and bring to Moises Ville the children they had buried in Monigotes and Palacios.\n\nIn 1903, soon after the Kishinev pogrom, an additional group from Bessarabia was organized. This group settled in the Mutchnik area, northwest of Moises Ville, at Línea Ortiz (Ortiz Line). And in 1905 a group from Kherson Governorate, Ukraine colonized the area of Monigotes. Several years later the zone of Capivara, to the northeast of Moises Ville, was colonized, In the decade of the 1930s German Jews persecuted by the Nazis began to arrive, in a wave that lasted until the beginning of World War II. After the war was over, several families of Dutch and German refugees arrived, most of them sent by the JCA.\n\nColonists of the first group and some from the second settled in the surrounding areas of a budding urban center. As Noe Cociovich related, that center had three shaky buildings in 1894: the synagogue, the JCA administration house and the public baths. The colonists' houses were arranged around them along three streets. The plots were 100 meters wide and 1,000 meters deep. Moisés Ville became the canonical town of the \"Gauchos Judíos\" (\"Jewish Gauchos\") who worked the land in Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nMoisés Ville, together with its sister colonies of Mauricio and Clara, were the main examples of the work of Baron Maurice de Hirsch's Jewish Colonization Association.\n\nIn recent times, Moisés Ville has embarked on a series of development projects, such as the resurfacing of the Provincial Highway 69S , which connects the town to National Highway 34 (Rosario-Salvador Mazza) through Palacios, a small village located at approximately 16 kilometers from the town. \n\nThe town is frequently visited by tourists from other parts of Argentina and overseas countries. Moisés Ville is one of the traditional towns included in the Pueblos Auténticos program, launched by the Argentinian government in 2017 in order to promote tourism in rural areas.\n\nMoisés Ville, which hosts a museum dedicated to the preservation of the cultural heritage established by Jewish colonization in the region, is in the process of applying to be recognized by UNESCO as a world heritage site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hatcher\n\nRichard Gordon Hatcher (July 10, 1933 – December 13, 2019) was an American politician who served as the first African-American mayor of Gary, Indiana for 20 years, from 1968 to 1988. At the time of his first election on November 7, 1967, he and Carl Stokes were the first African-Americans to be elected mayors of a U.S. city with more than 100,000 people. Hatcher also served as Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee in the early 1980s.\n\nHatcher was born in Michigan City, Indiana. He received a B.S. degree in business and government from Indiana University and a bachelor of law with honors in criminal law in 1956 and a J.D. from Valparaiso University School of Law in 1959. After moving to Gary, Indiana, Hatcher began practicing law in East Chicago, Indiana. In 1961, he began serving as a deputy prosecutor for Lake County, Indiana, until he was elected to Gary's City Council in 1963. He was the first and only freshman elected president of the City Council in Gary's history.\n\nHatcher launched a primary challenge against incumbent mayor Martin Katz in the Democratic primary election, and won by just 2300 votes. The Lake County Democratic Party's central organization, led by Chairman John Krupa, demanded that Hatcher allow them to select the city's police chief and city attorney, among other important city administrative offices, in exchange for their support for the general election. When Hatcher refused, Krupa directed the machine to work in favor of the Republican nominee, Joseph Radigan. In an intensely fought election marked by corruption, racial violence, voter purges and intimidation, and blatant vote rigging, Hatcher was able to cobble together a coalition of black voters and liberal white voters to overcome the odds and win the November election by just 2200 votes. \n\nElected in 1967, Hatcher was inaugurated mayor of Gary in 1968 and served until 1987. During his tenure as mayor, he became internationally known as a fervent and prolific civil rights spokesman. Hatcher was known for developing innovative approaches to urban problems and for being a national and international spokesman for civil rights, minorities, the poor and America's cities. He often delivered speeches alongside Martin Luther King, Robert F. Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, and other historic proponents of the civil rights movement. On April 5, 1968, he addressed President Lyndon B. Johnson, along with a collection of politicians and civil rights leaders, on the topic of the King assassination the night before and pending civil unrest.\n\nHatcher was instrumental in getting the 1972 National Black Political Convention to come to Gary when the convention organizers struggled to find a city willing to host the event. \n\nHatcher's tenure in office was difficult from the start. Although 4 of the 9 city council members were also black, two of these members appeared more loyal to the Democratic machine than to Hatcher. Three of the remaining five white city council members were consistently hostile to Hatcher and his proposals. The reasons for an uncooperative city council ranged from racial animosity to corruption over the patronage system and organized crime, to the personal political ambitions of some council members. However, Hatcher was successful in eliminating a red light district and reducing illegal gambling nearly to zero. However, as the city's steel industry began to collapse as part of the steel crisis of the 1970s and 1980s, white flight and population decline began to intensify, and unemployment and crime began to rise. Governing became easier after 1971, when a number of allies were elected to the city council and took positions in city administration. Hatcher's good government initiatives did help clean up the police department of corruption and reduced patronage, but macroeconomic and societal forces beyond the city's control caused Gary to spiral into severe decline. \n\nAlthough Hatcher won the 1967 election, the white-dominated Democratic machine was not about to give up; instead, they changed tactics and supported a middle-class black primary challenger who they felt was a racial moderate and (most importantly) was more cooperative with the machine: Dr. Alexander Williams, a prominent black physician who was elected Lake County coroner with the machine's backing, and who represented Gary's black middle class and criticized Hatcher's tactics and policies. Specifically, Williams criticized the ongoing crime wave and Hatcher's urban renewal policies that saw the demolition of thousands of housing units while only 300 replacement units were built. However, Williams won only 37.5% of the vote in the primary, as black voters remained overwhelmingly loyal to Hatcher. Hatcher then went on to crush the Republican nominee in the November general election by more than 50,000 votes, marking the end to any serious challenges from the Republicans or the Democratic machine. \n\nIn 1971, Hatcher targeted the neighboring unincorporated area of Merrillville, Indiana for annexation to gain more land for suburban expansion and to recapture some of the population that had left Gary. However, the white suburban state representatives passed a special exemption to Indiana's incorporation laws (which prohibited incorporation within a five mile radius of an incorporated city) which allowed Merrillville to incorporate itself into a town. Following this, virtually all major retailers, banks, and other business establishments closed their location and fled to Merrillville. Over 100 major businesses moved from downtown Gary and Broadway Avenue to Merrillville in the 1970s, making downtown Gary into a ghost town. Tens of thousands of white residents followed, and Gary lost valuable jobs, residents, and tax revenues. \n\nIn the 1984 U.S. presidential election, Mayor Hatcher served as the chairman for Jackson's campaign. He served as the Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1981 to 1985. \n\nHis daughter, Ragen Hatcher, is a member of the Indiana House of Representatives.\n\nIn 1988, Hatcher started his own consulting firm, R. Gordon Hatcher & Associates. From 1988 to 1989, he worked as an Institute of Politics Fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He also began teaching political science at Roosevelt University in 1989 and later became a senior research professor at Valparaiso University, in 1991. In the summer of 1996, Hatcher taught a law course at Cambridge University in England. In 1991 he sought to retake his former position as mayor, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Thomas Barnes in the Democratic primary. He later served as an adjunct professor at Indiana University-Northwest.\n\nHatcher died at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago on December 13, 2019. He was 86 years old.\n\nHatcher's funeral was held on December 21, 2019.\n\n"}

He worked on the \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip from 1940 to 1981.\n\nGonzales was born in Cabañas de Sayago, Zamora, Spain and died in Los Angeles.\n\nGonzales emigrated from Spain to the USA in 1918 via Ellis Island, and was employed at the Walt Disney Studios in September 1936, where he worked initially as an \"in-betweener\" on several short animated stories and on the motion picture \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", and also as an artist in the Publicity Department creating pencil art for publicity drawings and Good Housekeeping Disney children's pages.\n\nLater working in the comic strip department, Gonzales took over the illustrating of the \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip's Sunday page from Floyd Gottfredson in 1938. Only interrupted by his military service for the USA in World War II from 1942 to 1945, Gonzales performed this job until his retirement in 1981. During the war, he worked for the U.S. Army as an artist animating short newsreel clips promoting war bonds and the war effort.\n\nBill Walsh wrote the scripts for the Sunday pages from 1946 to 1963. These pages told funny stories from Mickey Mouse's everyday life (Mickey was portrayed as a \"guy next door\" - a middle class citizen with a normal life), as well as doing sometimes surrealistic gags featuring Gonzales' specialty, Goofy. Gonzales and Walsh also introduced a new character to the Disney universe, the intelligent and witty bird Ellsworth, in 1950. In general, the Sunday pages have status as better than Gottfredson's daily gags of the time (also written by Walsh).\n\nBeside the Sunday pages, Gonzales worked on other Disney comic strips and illustrations. He inked \"Donald Duck\" and \"Scamp\" dailies, illustrated newspaper comic adaptations of different Disney films, like \"Song of the South\", and illustrated some Disney books. He also worked on Disney's annual Christmas comic strip from 1960 to 1969.\n\nGonzales grew up in Westfield, Massachusetts, where he went to school and picked tobacco during summer jobs as a boy. He later lived and went to art school in New York City. His father, walking home from work one late-summer evening in 1936, tore a flyer from a telephone pole and gave it to Gonzales after dinner. The flyer invited artists to bring their portfolios to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a job opportunity. Gonzales was interviewed and hired on the spot, given $200 and told to report in two weeks to the Hyperion Studios in Los Angeles to work as an animator. His first assignment was as an \"in-betweener\" on what was to be the first animated full-length major motion picture, Snow White, for a man he'd never heard of before named Walt Disney.\n\nGonzales received a \"Mousecar\" award and a Hyperion Club award personally from Walt Disney during his career. The Mousecar was a much coveted award, given to the artists who had most significantly impacted the company's success. Modeled after the Oscar, which is awarded annually for achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Mousecar is a bronze statuette of Mickey Mouse in his trademark pose on a black base. The Hyperion Club award uses the same bronze statuette as the Mouscar, but it is on a wooden base with a Hyperion Club brass label on the base. Gonzales was named a Disney Legend posthumously at the 2017 D23 award ceremony. Of the hundreds of thousands of people who have been employed by the Walt Disney Company, as of 2017 less than 300 have been named \"Disney Legends\". It is the highest award given by the company. Walt Disney, who was very fond of his artists, used to joke that Manuel had signed Disney's signature (which Gonzales would sign on every comic strip he'd draw) more than Disney himself had in his lifetime.\n\nGonzales was married to his wife LaVonne, with whom he had two sons, Thomas and Daniel.\n\n"}

In the skirmish action, British forces under the command of Major John Graves Simcoe launched a surprise attack against Brigadier General John Lacey and three regiments of Pennsylvania militia, who were literally caught sleeping. The British inflicted significant damage, and Lacey and his forces were forced to retreat into neighboring Bucks County.\n\nThe British Army, led by General William Howe, had captured New York City in 1776 and Philadelphia in 1777. Even after the capture of Forts Mifflin and Mercer, which had previously prevented the resupply of British-occupied Philadelphia by sea, the British relied heavily upon the overland route between New York City and Philadelphia for the movement of men, supplies and communication. British troops also regularly foraged for supplies in the countryside around the city.\n\nSince December, Washington and the Continental Army were in winter quarters at Valley Forge, northwest of Philadelphia. John Lacey (who had been promoted to Brigadier General and commander of the Pennsylvania militia in January at the age of 23), was tasked by Washington with patrolling the region north of Philadelphia, between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. Washington ordered Lacey and the militia to prevent farmers from taking their goods into Philadelphia to sell to the British (who paid high prices, in gold), and to protect patriots in the region from harassment by British and Loyalist troops.\n\nWashington was highly critical of both Pennsylvania's militia recruitment and Lacey's performance. Pennsylvania, despite promising 1,000 militia to patrol that area, had been unable to raise that many, and Washington was considering calling in militia from neighboring states. Washington wrote that militia stipulated by the state had never been above half kept up and that General Lacey had only 70 men left in the field. Lacey had not been as effective as Brigadier General James Potter at interdicting trade with the British, and Washington hoped Potter, off on leave, would soon return.\n\nIn late April Lacey began a series of maneuvers and patrols across the area that ended with his arrival on April 27 at the Crooked Billet Tavern in present-day Hatboro. One of his straggling companies was attacked by a British patrol, and Loyalist spies informed John Graves Simcoe, leader of the Loyalist Queen's Rangers, of Lacey's whereabouts.\nIn Philadelphia, General Howe ordered Simcoe, to \"secure the country and facilitate the inhabitants bringing in their produce to market.\" During the winter of 1778, British and Loyalist troops repeatedly led raids into Bucks County, despite the presence of Lacey and the militia.\n\nIn April, Simcoe secured permission from Howe to launch an attack on Lacey and his militia. On the afternoon of April 30, he and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Abercromby led their contingent of troops out of Philadelphia and towards the Crooked Billet. By then Lacey's troops numbered about 400, including fresh arrivals from Cumberland and York Counties. That night Lacey ordered Lieutenant William Neilsen to begin a patrol between 2:00 and 3:00 am, and ordered the brigade of Thomas Downey to stand on alert. Neilsen failed to follow his orders, and his patrol only left camp shortly before daybreak on May 1. They had not gone far when they spotted the advancing British.\n\nThe British troops arrived at Crooked Billet at daybreak on May 1. Simcoe had planned a \"pincer\"-type attack, with his troops attacking from the north and east, and Abercromby's troops from the south and west. Lacey's pickets, in place to warn against any type of threat, noticed the British troops, but failed to fire off a warning shot for fear of being killed or captured. Neilsen sent a runner back to the camp to raise the alarm, but he never arrived. Surprised and outnumbered, the militia were soon routed and forced to retreat into Warminster, losing their supplies and equipment at their bivouac site.\n\nAn account of the battle, published on May 5 in Philadelphia's \"Royal Pennsylvania Gazette\", reads as follows:\n\nOn Thursday night last, a small party of the British infantry, dragoons, and Queen's rangers, with a few of Capt. HOVEDEN's Pennsylvania, and Capt. JAMES's Chester dragoons, left the city about eleven o'clock, and proceeded up the Old York road. About a mile beyond the Billet they fell in with Lacey's brigade of militia, consisting of about 500 men, and immediately attacked them: Lacey, at first, made some appearance of opposition, but, in a few seconds, was thrown into confusion, obliged to retreat with precipitation, and were pursued about 4 miles. They left between 80-100 dead on the field; and on Friday, between 50-60 prisoners, besides waggoners, with 10 of their waggons loaded with baggage, flour, salt, whiskey, &c. were brought in by the troops on their return: What number of rebels were wounded, we have not been able to learn. Besides the above waggons, 3 were burnt after taking out the horses; also all the huts and what baggage could not be brought off. The royal party did not lose a single man on this occasion, and have only 7 men wounded, and 2 horses killed.\n\nAs a result of this engagement, the American forces lost ten wagons full of much-needed supplies, and Lacey had almost 20% of his force killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Lieutenant Nielson, the officer in charge of the pickets, was court-martialed and cashiered from the militia for disobeying orders.\n\nOn May 11, Potter returned from his leave of absence and Lacey was relieved of his command. Washington requested that Lacey remain with the militia for a short time in order to familiarize Potter with the region. By late June, the British had withdrawn from Philadelphia, and the militia's safeguarding of the region was no longer of concern to Washington.\n\nAlmost immediately after the battle, reports surfaced that British and Loyalist troops had committed atrocities, including the murder of prisoners-of-war and setting fire to the American wounded. On May 7, Washington ordered Brigadier General William Maxwell to conduct an inquiry into these allegations so that a report could be made to General Howe. Andrew Long, a justice of the peace in Bucks County, took the depositions of Colonel Watts and four residents who witnessed the battle: Samuel Henry, William Stayner, Thomas Craven and Samuel Erwin. Watts reported \"we found the bodies of the dead usid [sic] in a most inhuman & barbarous manner\" and that \"the most cruel Barbarity that had ever been exercised by any civilised Nation; nay, Savage barbarity in its utmost exertion of cruelty could but equal it.\"\n\nLacey's report to Major General John Armstrong further documented the atrocities: \nSome of the unfortunate, who fell into the merciless hands of the British, were more cruelly and inhumanely butchered. Some were set on fire with buckwheat straw, and others had their clothes burned on their backs. Some of the surviving sufferers say they saw the enemy set fire to wounded while yet alive, who struggled to put it out but were too weak and expired under the torture. I saw those lying in the buckwheat straw—they made a most melancholy appearance. Others I saw, who, after being wounded with a ball, had received near a dozen wounds with cutlasses and bayonets. I can find as many witnesses to the proof of the cruelties as there were people on the spot, and that was no small number who came as spectators. \nAmong the many killed and wounded American soldiers were: George Matthews, 5th Battalion, Cumberland County Militia, wounded; John Poorman of Allen Township, soldier of the 5th Class, Third Battalion, Cumberland County Militia, killed and buried at Crooked Billet; Robert Montgomery, soldier of the 7th Battalion Cumberland County Militia, Captain Isaac Miller's Company, wounded; Aaron Penwell, Captain Walter Denny's Company, lost his arm in battle and was taken prisoner; Aaron Penwell of West Pensboro Township, 7th Battalion Militia, lost left arm; John Taylor(senior)of Greenwood Township, then Cumberland now Perry, 8th Battalion of Militia, wounded.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on the novel \"Red Sorghum Clan\" by Nobel laureate Mo Yan.\n\nThe film marked the directorial debut of internationally acclaimed filmmaker Zhang Yimou, and the acting debut of film star Gong Li. With its lush and lusty portrayal of peasant life, it immediately vaulted Zhang to the forefront of the Fifth Generation directors. The film won the Golden Bear Award at Berlin Film Festival.\n\nThe film takes place in a rural village in China's eastern province of Shandong during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It is narrated from the point of view of the protagonist’s grandson, who reminisces about his grandmother, Jiu'er (S: 九儿, T: 九兒, P: \"Jiǔ'ér\"). She was a poor girl who was sent by her parents into a pre-arranged marriage with an old man, Li Datou, who owns a distillery.\n\nAs Jiu'er's wedding party crosses a field of sorghum, they are attacked by a bandit. One of the men hired to carry Jiu'er's sedan chair manages to fight off the assailant. After Jiu'er safely reaches the distillery, her rescuer, whom she has been eyeing during the trip, disappears. During Jiu'er's trip back to her parents' village, he jumps out of the sorghum field and, after chasing down Jiu'er, carries her off into the sorghum stalks and rapes her.\n\nAt the distillery, it is discovered that Li Datou has died of mysterious causes, leading many of the distillery's workers to suspect murder. Nothing is proven, however, and since Jiu'er's late husband was without heir, it is she who takes ownership of the distillery, which has recently fallen on hard times. She inspires the workers to take new pride in their wine. One day, Jiu'er's lover and the narrator's grandfather becomes drunk and loudly insists to the group of men accompanying him that he is going to share her bed. When he enters the bedroom, however, she, embarrassed, tosses him out. The other men on the scene carry him away, sticking him in a vat of liquor where he remains for the next three days. Meanwhile, a group of bandits kidnap Jiu'er, forcing the distillery workers to pay a ransom for her freedom.\n\nAfter emerging from the vat, the narrator's grandfather witnesses the worn down Jiu'er. The narrator's grandfather goes to confront the leader of the bandits, demanding to know whether the leader raped Jiu'er. The leader said he did not rape Jiu'er, because Jiu'er told the leader that she already slept with the disease-ridden old man Li Datou. The narrator's grandfather returns, but takes out his anger on the workers by urinating into four vats of liquor. To the clan's surprise, the urine somehow makes the liquor taste better than ever. Its product newly improved, the distillery begins to see financial success.\n\nThe War begins and Imperial Japanese Army troops invade the area. The Japanese soldiers then torture and kill Jiu'er's friend Luohan, a respected distillery worker. Jiu'er incites the workers to avenge his death. In the early dawn, they hide themselves in the sorghum field, prepared to ambush the Japanese military vehicles the moment they pass by. While waiting, however, the workers become distracted by hunger. When Jiu'er is informed of this by her young child (the narrator's father), she brings out some lunch for the workers. Arriving just as the Japanese soldiers do, Jiu'er is shot and killed in the chaotic skirmish that ensues, and the explosive traps meant for the Japanese trucks end up killing almost everyone at the scene. Only the narrator's grandfather and father manage to survive the encounter.\n\n\nLike Zhang's later film, \"The Road Home\" (1999), \"Red Sorghum\" is narrated by the main characters' grandson, but \"Red Sorghum\" lacks the flashback framing device of \"The Road Home\" (the viewer never sees the narrator).\n\nThe cinematography by cinematographer Gu Changwei makes use of rich, intense colors. Zhang himself was a cinematographer prior to his directorial debut, and worked closely with Gu.\n\nUpon its release, \"Red Sorghum\" garnered international acclaim, most notably winning the coveted Golden Bear at the 1988 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nRoger Ebert said, in his review and synopsis in \"Chicago Sun-Times\", \"There is a strength in the simplicity of this story, in the almost fairy-tale quality of its images and the shocking suddenness of its violence, that Hollywood in its sophistication has lost.\"\n\nOthers, such as Wang Yichuan, pointed to the director's fascination with the \"strongman,\" and found hints of \"fascist aesthetics\" in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The population consists mostly of Iranian Azerbaijanis who speak the Azerbaijani language. It is from Tabriz, the largest city in northwestern Iran.\n\nMaragheh is an ancient city encompassed by a high wall ruined in many places, and has four gates. Two stone bridges in good condition are said to have been constructed during the reign of Hulaku Khan (1217-1265), who made Maragheh the capital of the Ilkhanate. Shortly thereafter it became the seat of the Church of the East Patriarch Mar Yaballaha III.\n\nOne of the famous burial towers, the Gonbad-e-Kabud (\"Blue Tower\", 1197), is decorated with decorative patterns resembling Penrose tiles.\n\nThe 14th century book Al-Vaghfiya Al-Rashidiya (Rashid's Deeds of Endowment) describes many of the estates in the town, and several of the quanat of the time.\n\nIts marble, which is known throughout Iran as Maragha marble, is a travertine obtained at the village of Dashkasan near Azarshahr about 50 km north-west from Maragheh. It is deposited from water, which bubbles up from a number of springs in the form of horizontal layers, which at first are thin crusts and can easily be broken, but gradually solidify and harden into blocks with a thickness of about 20 cm. It is a singularly beautiful substance, being of pink, greenish, or milk-white color, streaked with reddish copper-colored veins. It is exported and sold worldwide under such names as Azarshar Red or Yellow.\n\nLate Miocene strata near Maragheh have produced rich harvests of vertebrate fossils for European and North American museums. A multi-national team reopened the fossil site in 2008.\n\nHamdollah Mostowfi of the 13th century mentions the language of Maragheh as \"Pahlavi Mughayr\" (modified Pahlavi, Pahlavi being the name for Middle Persian). The 17th century Ottoman Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi who traveled to Safavid Iran also states:“The majority of the women in Maragheh converse in Pahlavi”. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: \"At the present day, the inhabitants speak Adhar Turkish, but in the 14th century they still spoke “arabicized Pahlawi” (Nuzhat al-Qolub: Pahlawi Mu’arrab) which means an Iranian dialect of the north western group.\"\n\nThe city is situated in a narrow valley running nearly north and south at the eastern extremity of a well-cultivated plain opening towards Lake Urmia, the world's sixth-largest saltwater lake, which lies 30 km to the west. The town is encompassed by a high wall ruined in many places, and has four gates. Maragheh is surrounded by extensive vineyards and orchards, all well watered by canals led from the river, and producing great quantities of fruit. The hills west of the town consist of horizontal strata of sandstone covered with irregular pieces of basalt.\n\nOn a hill west of the town are the remains of the famous Maragheh observatory called \"Rasad Khaneh\", constructed under the direction the Ilkhanid king, Hülagü Khan for Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. The building, which no doubt served as a citadel as well, enclosed a space of 340 by 135 meters, and the foundations of the walls were 13 to 2 meters in thickness. The observatory was constructed in the thirteenth century and was said to house a staff of at least ten astronomers and a librarian who was in charge of the library which allegedly contained over 40,000 books. This observatory was one of the most prestigious during the medieval times in the Islamic Empire during the golden age of Islamic science. The famous astronomer Ibn al-Shatir did much of his work in this observatory.\n\n\"For a complete list see: \"\n\n\n"}

Although there have been many different members throughout the band's career, Krztoff is the songwriting, recording and conceptual leader. But the team of Krztoff and R.H.Bear are the ones driving the tank. The group has performed with as many as 11 and as small as 2 people on stage. The early shows in 1993–95 New York included a dominatrix and fire-breather. In 2013 they added Brendin Ross to the lineup as a keyboard player. In 2014 they introduced former Agnostic Front drummer Steve Gallo.\n\nBeginning in December 1992 Bile began as an art project to become the anti-band. Bored by being in simple jeans and T-shirt rock/metal bands, the band became the top drawing NYC live spectacle, which led to them signing with a New York-based indie record label and released three albums on Energy Records, including their debut, \"Suckpump\", \"Teknowhore\" and \"Biledegradable\". Following tours with Gwar, 16 Volt,and numerous lineup changes, the band became unsatisfied with Energy Records and negotiated his way off the label, inciting Krztoff and R.H. Bear (Krztoff's longtime friend and bandmate) to regroup and record for their own label, Bile Style Records. Krztoff recorded \"Sex Reflex\". The album features their most popular song to date, \"In League\". Their song, \"I Reject\" appeared on the 1995 \"Mortal Kombat\" soundtrack. Their song \"In League\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 Dee Snider film \"Strangeland\". Krztoff went on to join Pigface as guitarist in 2001. With help from Martin Atkins' distribution conduit, Bile Style Records then released \"Nightmare Before Krztoff\", \"Black From The Dead\", \"Demonic Electronic\", \"The Copy Machine\", \"Frankenhole\" and \"Regurge\" The Best o' Bile\".\n\nKrztoff coined the phrase \"Demonic Electronic\" to best describe their sound and live show since the band doesn't fit into any one genre. There are few bands on earth that truly share the Bile sound. Except that it's very extreme.\n\nBile has played and toured the U.S. extensively with artists such as Pigface, KMFDM, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Ohgr, Gwar, Misfits, and Rammstein.\n\nWhen performing live, Bile consists of Krztoff (vocals, lead guitar), R.H. Bear (bass, effects), Dave Sussman (guitar), and former Agnostic Front drummer Steve Gallo. \n\nIn 2013, Bile released the album \"Built to Fuck, Born to Kill\" as a digital release online.\n\n"}

The center of the protests was the republic's capital, Tbilisi, where spontaneous rallies to mark the third anniversary of Stalin's death and to protest Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin quickly evolved into an uncontrollable mass demonstration and rioting which paralyzed the city. Soon, political demands such as the change of the central government in Moscow and calls for the independence of Georgia from the Soviet Union appeared.\n\nThe local Georgian authorities, confused and demoralized, passed on the responsibility to the Soviet military. Later on 9 March the troops deployed in the city opened fire upon the students picketing the government buildings in what the official Soviet version held was \"an act of self-defense\". The agitated crowds continued resistance on 10 March but were eventually dispersed by tanks. Estimates of the number of casualties range from several dozens to several hundred.\n\nIn spite of prompt pacification, the 1956 events marked a turning point after which Georgian loyalty to the Soviet Union was gravely compromised and the nation's consolidation intensified. In the view of the historian Ronald Grigor Suny, \"the swift and brutal response from the Soviet government illustrated starkly its inability to resolve the dilemma of how much of the Soviet system to change and how much of Stalin's authoritarianism to preserve. The government’s confusion in Tbilisi was a bloody sign that reform was to be limited by the party's determination to preserve its essential monopoly of power.\"\n\nOn 25 February 1956, at a closed session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev delivered a \"secret speech\" in which he criticized actions taken by the Stalin regime, particularly the purges of the military and the upper Party echelons, and the development of Stalin's alleged cult of personality, while maintaining support for other ideals of Communism by invoking Vladimir Lenin.\n\nRumors that \"Vozhd\" (the Leader) and \"the Father of the Nations\", who had been established as the principal symbol in early Soviet communism, had been denounced by his successor quickly spread throughout the Soviet Union. Although the details were unknown, it came as a real shock to the Soviet society.\n\nIn spite of party's restriction of Georgian nationalism, Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinization was, paradoxically, a blow to Georgian national pride. The younger generation of the Georgians, not fully acquainted with the darker side of Stalin's rule and bred on the panegyrics and permanent praise of the \"genius\" of Stalin, was proud to consider him being a Georgian that ruled over great Russia, and, as believed widely, dominated the world. Now, Stalin's denigration was seen as a symbol for the mistreatment of Georgian national consciousness at the hands of the Russian/Soviet rulers.\n\nPatriotic sentiment mixed with political protest was further inflamed by the sarcastic and bitter manner in which Khrushchev ascribed all horrors of the era to the \"genial\" leader Stalin, whom, as he ironically put it, the Georgians so much enjoyed calling \"the great son of the Georgian nation\". Eduard Shevardnadze, then a Komsomol leader in Kutaisi and eventually to become President of post-Soviet Georgia, later recalled that Khrushchev's ironic remark on Georgians at the end of his speech was particularly hurtful to the pride of Georgian youth.\n\nThe painful reaction caused by de-Stalinization in Georgia has been variously interpreted. It has been seen by many as a revival of Stalinism and by others as the first open expression of Georgian nationalism since the abortive revolt in 1924. Sergei Arutiunov of the Russian Academy of Sciences relates:\n\nThe events in Georgia passed largely unreported in the Soviet press and became a taboo theme for several decades to come. What happened can be reconstructed on the analysis of several, though frequently conflicting, contemporary reports, eyewitnesses' accounts and a few surviving secret Soviet documents.\n\nAccording to the special report of Vladimir Janjgava, Georgian SSR Minister of Internal Affairs, the unrest began on 4 March 1956, when groups of students gathered to mark the third anniversary of Stalin's death at the Stalin monument at the Kura embankment in downtown Tbilisi. Indignant at Khrushchev's speech, they were aggressive towards the policemen who had thrown a cordon around the area. Georgian communist Parastishvili climbed the Stalin monument, drank some wine from a bottle, smashed the bottle and said: \"Let Stalin's enemies die, like this bottle!\".\n\nThe demonstration gradually grew large, attracting more and more people, who were bringing memorial wreaths to the Stalin monument. The confused local authorities did not actively oppose these activities. The demonstrations in the capital triggered similar protests in other parts of the republic such as Gori, Kutaisi, Rustavi, Sukhumi, and Batumi.\n\nBy 6 March the demonstrations in Tbilisi had become more organized and more numerous. That day a closed letter of the CPSU Central Committee, \"On the Cult of Personality\", a summary of the speech that the General Secretary read on the final day of the Party Congress held last February, was read loud at a special session attended by the Georgian ministers and the local media. News about the surprise session of the Georgian SSR's Ministers Council quickly spread throughout Tbilisi and the situation escalated.\n\nEarly on 7 March the students of Tbilisi State University went out onto the streets instead of attending classes, where they were joined by students from other institutes and schoolchildren. The demonstrators went down the main Tbilisi thoroughfare, Rustaveli Avenue, to Lenin Square, stopping at the House of Government and then at the City Hall, chanting the slogan \"Long Live Great Stalin! Long Live the Party of Lenin and Stalin! Long Live Soviet Georgia!\", accompanied by the cacophony of car sirens and horns. Having overcome the police resistance, the protesters gathered anew at the Stalin monument.\n\nProtesters worked out their demands to authorities: an official holiday day on 18 December (Stalin's birthday), publishing of articles devoted to Stalin's life in all local newspapers, showing of films \"The Fall of Berlin\" and \"The Unforgettable Year 1919\" by Mikheil Chiaureli (both films were typical cinematic pieces of Stalin's cult of personality) in cinemas and invitation of the Chinese marshal Zhu De, who was at that time visiting Georgia, to the meeting. By the end of day, the number of demonstrators reached 70,000. The central Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs initially underestimated the scale of the protests, and the information based on the minister Janjghava reached the Central Committee later on 8 March.\n\nBy that time, the city had become paralyzed. The meetings were simultaneously held in several places, especially in Lenin Square and at the wreath-covered Stalin monument. The central streets were full of the demonstrators who loudly denounced Khrushchev, demanded that Stalin be rehabilitated and that his anniversary be allowed, and specifically asked Vyacheslav Molotov to defend Stalin's name. Barricades were raised, buses and cars overturned. The crowd directed traffic and in several cases even stopped it. Several clashes broke out with the drivers who resisted and with the police. When several activists were arrested, the demonstrations grew even more massive and the crowd became more aggressive. The Georgian first secretary, Vasil Mzhavanadze, addressed the protesters and the visiting Chinese marshal Zhu De greeted the crowd, but he refused to visit the Stalin monument and the demonstrations did not disperse.\n\nAs the demonstrations continued, the local government began to lose control over the situation. Paralyzed by the scale of the protests and the demonstrators' appeal to Georgian patriotism and manifested communist loyalties, the police reacted more and more sluggishly. Early on 9 March the authorities tried to defuse the tensions and allowed the celebration of the anniversary to be held. But the belated attempts at concession did not yield any result. Later that day, at the meeting near the Stalin monument, political demands were read aloud in the presence of several party officials.\n\nAccording to the controversial testimony of Ruben Kipiani, later tried as an author of this petition, the demands were: first, return of the \"closed letter\" on Stalin to the CPSU Central Committee; second, removal of Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, and Nikita Khrushchev from both party and government positions; third, creation of a new government; fourth, release of the Azerbaijan SSR first secretary Mir Jafar Baghirov from prison; fifth, promotion of the Soviet Georgian officials Akaki Mgeladze and Mzhavandze to the Central Committee Presidium; sixth, appointment of Stalin's son Vasily to the Central Committee; seven, institution of an amnesty. It was decided to send approximately ten persons to the nearby Communications Building in Rustaveli Avenue in order to send a telegram to Moscow.\n\nA parallel rally at Kolmeurneobis Square grew increasingly anti-Soviet. People were singing the long-suppressed anthem \"Dideba\" and waving flags of pre-Soviet Georgia. When some persons in civilian dress interfered, fighting broke out. Leaflets appeared next. According to the eyewitness and Georgian-Jewish author Faina Baazova (daughter of David Baazov), the leaflets called for the secession of Georgia from the Soviet Union, a demand not heard previously.\n\nThe events that followed are less clear. Later that day, the decision to bring troops of the Transcaucasian Military District, then commanded by Col. Gen. Ivan Fedyuninsky, into the matter was made in Moscow. The predominantly Georgian units stationed in the area were not deployed because of suspected unreliability, however. The Soviet Interior Ministry officials reported that Tbilisi had gone out of control. They claimed that the demonstrators, many of whom were allegedly drunk and armed, were pillaging the city, contemplated the pogroms of ethnic Russians and Armenians, and planned to seize the government buildings.\n\nThe same evening, the authorities broadcast though radio an appeal calling the rallies to cease and announced that the commander of Tbilisi garrison, Major General Gladkov, was introducing a curfew beginning at midnight on 10 March. Many protesters sensed an approaching threat and began to leave the city center. Close to midnight, however, people learned that the delegation sent into the Communications Building had been detained, ostensibly for verification of identity. The crowd rushed to rescue the delegates and a clash with the soldiers guarding the building ensued. The troops started firing into the crowd to prevent the protesters from storming the building. Simultaneously, tanks moved to oust the demonstrators from Lenin Square and at the Stalin monument. The protesters tried to resume rallies on 10 March, but they were again dispersed by the troops. Several dozens, if not hundreds, died in this crackdown. As no official report exists, various estimates put the number of casualties from 106 to 800. Hundreds were wounded and injured. Over 200 were arrested in the ensuing reprisals and many were subsequently deported to labor camps in Siberia.\n\nThe March 1956 rallies widened rifts within the Georgian Communist Party, as several officials expressed solidarity with the people. In July 1956, the Central Committee in Moscow issued a resolution critical of the Georgian Communist leadership, and in August the second secretary in Tbilisi was replaced by a Russian. Yet, Mzhavanadze was successful in pacifying Georgians by minimizing the number of victims in his interviews and sponsoring a program of lectures to spread the party's new views. For his success, Mzhavanadze was raised to candidate membership in the Central Committee Presidium in June 1957.\n\nAlthough no apparent attempts at defying the Soviet rule in Georgia were to be made until April 1978, the grudges against the central government in Moscow continued to be held. Many in Georgia held Khrushchev personally responsible for ordering the army to fire on the protesters. The Tbilisi events made Georgia's deviance from the rest of the Soviet Union, with the possible exception of the Baltics, apparent. The loyalty to the Union was gravely compromised and an anti-Soviet sentiment became an essential feature of the reemerging Georgian nationalism.\n\nIt was in the immediate aftermath of the 1956 event that the first Georgian underground groups calling for an outright secession from the Soviet Union appeared. They were typically small and weak and the Soviet authorities were able to quickly neutralize them. However, they gave origin to a new generation of dissidents, such as Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia, both teenage participants of the March 1956 rally, who would lead Georgia into its struggle for independence in the 1980s.\n\n\n"}

The AICC developed guidelines for aviation industry in the development, delivery, and evaluation of CBT, WBT, and related training technologies. \n\nAICC specifications were usually designed to be general purpose (not necessarily Aviation Specific) so that learning technology vendors can spread their costs across multiple markets and thus provide products (needed by the Aviation Industry) at a lower cost. This strategy resulted in AICC specifications having broad acceptance and relevance to non-aviation and aviation users alike.\n\nThe AICC was formed in 1988 by Aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, and McDonnell Douglas) to address Airline concerns about non-standard computing (cost) issues arising from the proliferation of new multimedia training materials emerging at that time.\n\nIn 1989, the AICC published computing platform recommendations for CBT, training media. A PC-platform was established as the primary delivery platform for CBT media. \n\nIn 1992, the AICC produced a digital audio interoperability specification for DOS based platforms. This specification allowed multiple CBT vendors to use a single audio card. AICC audio drivers were produced for Elan, SoundBlaster(tm), WICAT, and other audio cards. A large number of older legacy CBT applications still use this specification today.\n\nIn 1993, the AICC produced what is widely regarded as the first runtime interoperability specification for Learning Management Systems (LMS) a.k.a. CMI Systems. This AICC specification (CMI001 - AICC/CMI Guidelines For Interoperability) was originally designed for CD-ROM/LAN (local file-based) operation and was updated in January 1998 to add a web-based interface called HACP (HTTP-based AICC/CMI Protocol). In September 1999, the CMI001 specification was updated to add a JavaScript API runtime interface. The runtime environment data model and API used in the SCORM specification is a derivative of this work.\n\nThe AICC HACP standard for CMI is widely used by Learning Management Systems and other systems to call content and assessments. Although it is pre-XML, it is very robust and unambiguous and many consider it to be more secure and reliable than alternatives such as SCORM, especially for content or assessments hosted on web servers not collocated with the calling system (e.g. Cross Domain Communication).\n\nAn emerging standard is the AICC PENS standard, which lets content creating tools send a manifest to an LMS easily. (See CMI010 - Package Exchange Notification Services). The September 2006 AICC meeting included a Plugfest where vendors demonstrated PENS interoperability. \n\nIn November 2010, the AICC announced that it would begin work on a replacement of its existing CMI specification. This effort was later given the name \"CMI-5\". A SOAP-Based specification for CMI-5 was drafted in May 2012 but was never formally released.\n\nIn October 2012, the AICC announced that it had adopted the Experience API (xAPI) specification (a.k.a. \"Tin Can\") for its CMI-5 effort starting a significant re-design that is currently in progress. \n\nThe AICC coordinated its efforts with other learning technology specifications organizations engaged in similar work such as IMS Global, OKI, ADL, IEEE/LTSC, LETSI, and ISO/SC36.\n\nIn December 2014, the AICC formally announced that it had dissolved citing declining participation. \nThe AICC transferred the CMI-5 effort and its document archive to the ADL. \n\nSee AICC Document Archive - Hosted by ADL\n\ncmi5 is still currently under development and is now administered by the ADL.

{"id": "1815900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815900", "title": "Montgomery Academy", "text": "Montgomery Academy\n\nThe Montgomery Academy is a non-sectarian independent day school located in Montgomery, Alabama. The Lower School accommodates kindergarten through fifth grade and the Upper School sixth through twelfth. The school's current total enrollment is just under 900, of which approximately 300 are in the Upper School. The Montgomery Academy was founded in 1959 as a segregation academy. Montgomery, in the 2010 census, was 56% African American, while at the Academy 90% of the students are white.\n\nIn December 1958 the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) sued the city of Montgomery to force an end to racial segregation in the city's public parks. Rather than accede to this demand the city closed down all of its parks, including the Montgomery Zoo, effective on January 1, 1959. In response to this, Martin Luther King on behalf of the MIA, announced that the Association would attempt to end racial segregation in Montgomery public schools by having large numbers of black children apply for admission to white schools in order to provide test cases which might allow a judge to declare the Alabama Pupil Placement Act unconstitutional. Governor John Patterson threatened to shut down the public schools to prevent their integration and the Ku Klux Klan leader Robert Shelton promised that the Klan was prepared to prevent integration by violent means if necessary.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the Montgomery Academy was founded in 1959 as a segregation academy by Robert Schoenhof Weil, Montgomery physician Hugh MacGuire, and a \"group of white social leaders\" for \"boys and girls of white parentage.\" According to Jim Leeson of the Southern Education Reporting Service, \"desegregation was one of the issues discussed in\" the Academy's \"formation in the mid-50s\" although it was not possible to determine if that was the only factor that led to its founding. The first classes were held in the former governor's mansion on the corner of South Perry Street & South Street (now demolished). Initially, students were in \"forms\" (grades) 1 through 6. The initial 1959-60 \"6th Form\" constituted the first graduating class in 1966.\n\nAlthough most segregation academies had markedly deficient curricula, the Montgomery Academy was one of a small number with accreditation, \"complete academic programs,\" and \"competent staffs.\" For instance, already by 1961 the Montgomery Academy's René Lévêque was chairman of the examination committee for the French I section of the National French Contest, sponsored since 1936 by the American Association of Teachers of French. By 1967 Jim Leeson stated that the school had \"changed its role to be that of a preparatory school.\"\n\nFor the first two decades of its existence The Montgomery Academy did not admit any African American students. In 1970 the Academy adopted an explicit policy stating that race would not be considered in admissions as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations. According to then-headmaster James Adams, although there had previously been no written statement to that effect, the Academy had never used race as a basis for admissions.\n\nAt its founding the Academy didn't have the financial resources to build its own football field or other athletic facilities. However, the city of Montgomery allowed the school and three other segregation academies (the Saint James School, the Stephens-Spears School, and the Central Alabama Academy) to use athletic facilities at the city's public schools. In 1972, federal Judge Frank M. Johnson, whose son John was a student at the Montgomery Academy, enjoined the city from continuing this practice, writing that \"In allowing private academies to use city facilities, Montgomery is providing aid to private, segregated schools, thus facilitating their establishment and operation as an alternative for white students who in most instances are seeking to avoid desegregated public schools.\"\n\nIn 1976 the Academy, along with the Saint James School, was named in a suit filed against United States Secretary of the Treasury William Simon and Commissioner of Internal Revenue Donald C. Alexander by five women from Montgomery charging that the two men had encouraged the development of segregated schools by allowing them tax-deductible status. The school was identified as a discriminatory institution by the plaintiffs in \"Allen v. Wright\", a lawsuit by black parents that was decided in 1984 by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nArchie Douglas, a previous headmaster of The Montgomery Academy, said in 2004 that he believed the school was started in reaction to desegregation and \"that those who resented the civil rights movement or sought to get away from it took refuge in the academy.\" He noted that the school, by 2004, had a philosophy of openness and did not discriminate with regard to race. As of 2014, the student body of The Montgomery Academy is more than 10% percent non-white.\n\nThe Montgomery Academy's first home was in a historic mansion, built in 1906, and serving as the official residence of Alabama's governor between 1911 and 1950 which was torn down to make way for Interstate 85.\nIn 1963, the school relocated to a new site on Vaughn Road, now the premises of the Middle and Upper Schools. As student body size steadily grew, the initial twelve classrooms and lunchroom/auditorium were supplemented by seven classrooms and a library in 1965, four classrooms and a gymnasium in 1966, five classrooms in 1967, and three Montessori areas in 1971.\n\nThe Perry Hill Road Campus for the Lower School, which by that time included \"Form K\" (Kindergarten), was opened in the late 1980s. In 1996 the Vaughn Road campus added the Garzon Library, designed by local architects Seay Seay and Litchfield. The library's central octagonal rotunda establishes a focal landmark for the Upper School Campus.\n\nThe firm was then later contracted to design a new building, the Mary Katherine Archibald Blount Upper School, as well as a pedestrian bridge connecting the academic campus with newly built athletic fields across the busy Vaughn Road. These fields included new baseball, softball, and soccer fields. Previously, the land which is now the athletic campus had been an immense lawn for a Masonic retirement home.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the school began a renovation, completed in 2009, of the old Mead Hall, which includes James W. Wilson Jr. Theater, as well as facilities for the forensics and drama programs. The project also includes Sahlie Upper School Commons, an extension to the existing Upper School Building, as well as a state-of-the-art track and field facility around the Hutchinson Soccer Field. The track was built by the same company that was contracted to install the track for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Montgomery Academy's curriculum is entirely college preparatory, with more than 85 different high school course choices in nine disciplines. Students must carry at least five academic courses at all times. Thirty AP and honors sections are offered in all core areas. Students from The Montgomery Academy have also been involved in projects in recent years to promote racial harmony and to document Montgomery's links to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThe Academy is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools and the Alabama Association of Independent Schools.\n\nThe school's athletics teams and squadrons are nicknamed the Eagles and the school colors are cardinal red and navy blue. The school competes with other Alabama high schools, both public and private, in the Alabama High School Athletic Association. Montgomery Academy has 2 primary athletic rivals in the city of Montgomery: Trinity Presbyterian School and St. James School. These three schools also compete in the Capital City Conference, which is a collection of the five private schools in the city of Montgomery that compete in the AHSAA. The CCC also includes city rivals Alabama Christian Academy and Montgomery Catholic Preparatory School, and formerly included St. Jude Educational Institute.\n\nTwo thirds of the Academy's middle and high school students participate in athletics. The Academy was recognized as the leader in 3A varsity sports for both boys and girls by the \"Birmingham News\", and the Montgomery Academy is one of ten schools competing in the AHSAA to win at least 50 team state championships. During the 2012-2014 school years, Montgomery Academy competed in class 2A due to a decline in school population, before moving back up to class 3A for the 2014-2016 school years. Beginning in the 2018-19 school year, select athletic teams competed in class 4A due to the AHSAA's new \"competitive balance rule.\" These sports included both tennis and soccer.\n\nThe school has won a number of state championships, including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1815965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815965", "title": "James L. Kemper", "text": "James L. Kemper\n\nJames Lawson Kemper (June 11, 1823 – April 7, 1895) was a lawyer, a Confederate general in the American Civil War, and the 37th Governor of Virginia. He was the youngest brigade commander and only non-professional military officer in the division that led Pickett's Charge, during which he was severely wounded.\n\nKemper was born at \"Mountain Prospect\" plantation in Madison County, Virginia, the son of William and Maria E. Allison Kemper. His father's family had emigrated from near what became Siegen, Germany, in the early 18th century. His great-grandfather had been among the miners recruited for Governor Alexander Spotswood's colony at Germanna, Virginia, and his merchant father had moved to the new town of Madison Court House in the 1790s after his own father had died falling from a horse in 1783, leaving his widow to take care of five daughters and a son. By the time young James was born, his paternal grandmother and four aunts also lived at the plantation which William Kemper had bought for $5,541.40 in 1800.\n\nHis maternal great-grandfather, Col. John Jasper Stadler, had served on George Washington's staff as a civil engineer and planned fortifications in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, and his grandfather John Stadler Allison served as an officer in the War of 1812, but died when his daughter Maria was very young. Although several of his paternal ancestors were involved in the German Reformed Church, William Kemper was an elder in the local Presbyterian church and his mother was devout, but also hosted dances and parties that lasted several days. His brother, Frederick T. Kemper later founded Kemper Military School.\n\nJames Kemper had virtually no military training as a boy, but his father and a neighboring planter, Henry Hill of Culpeper, founded Old Field School on the plantation to educate local children, including A.P. Hill, who became a lifelong friend. From 1830–1840, Kemper boarded during winters at Locust Dale Academy, which had a military corps of cadets. Kemper later attended Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) and also took civil engineering classes at nearby Virginia Military Institute. At Washington College's graduation ceremony in 1842, 19-year-old Kemper gave the commencement address, taking for a topic \"The Need of a Public School System in Virginia.\" Kemper then returned home, where he joined a Tee-Total (Temperance) Society as well as studied law under George W. Summers of Kanawha County (a former U.S. Representative), after which Washington College awarded him a Master's degree in June 1845. He was admitted to the Virginia bar on October 2, 1846.\n\nAfter Congress had declared war on Mexico in 1846, President James K. Polk called for nine regiments of volunteers. Kemper and his friend Birkett D. Fry of Kanawha County traveled to the national capital on December 15, 1846, hoping to secure commissions in the First Regiment of Virginia Volunteers. After traveling to Richmond and back to Washington for more networking, Kemper learned that he had been appointed the unit's quartermaster and captain under Col. John Hamtramck. During the Mexican–American War, Kemper received favorable reviews and met many future military leaders, but his unit arrived just after the Battle of Buena Vista and mainly maintained a defensive perimeter in Coahuila province.\n\nHonorably discharged from the U.S. Army on August 3, 1848, Kemper returned to practice law in Madison County, and neighboring Orange and Culpeper Counties. He represented many fellow veterans making land claims, as well as speculated in real estate and helped form the Blue Ridge Turnpike Company (between Gordonsville and the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nInterested in politics, Kemper first campaigned for office in 1850, but lost the contest to become clerk of the Commonwealth's constitutional convention. Promoting himself as pro-slavery, anti-abolitionist, and pro-states' rights, Kemper defeated Marcus Newman and was elected to represent Madison County in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1853 (the year his father died at age 76). A strong advocate of state military preparedness, as well as an ally of Henry A. Wise, Kemper rose to become chairman of the Military Affairs Committee. By 1858, he was serving as a brigadier general in the Virginia militia.\n\nIn early 1861, Kemper became Speaker, a position he held until January 1863. Much of his term as Speaker coincided with his service in the Confederate States Army.\n\nAfter the start of the Civil War, Kemper served as a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of Virginia, and then a colonel in the Confederate States Army, becoming head of the 7th Virginia Infantry. At First Bull Run, Kemper led the regiment as part of Jubal Early's brigade. His regiment was later assigned to Brigadier General A.P. Hill's brigade in Major General James Longstreet's division of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. On May 26, Hill was promoted to division command and Kemper, as the ranking colonel, assumed command of the brigade. At Seven Pines, Kemper's brigade attempted to relieve General D.H. Hill's battered troops, but had to retreat from massed enemy artillery fire and did not engage the Union infantry. Nonetheless, Kemper was promoted to brigadier general on June 3. During the Seven Days Battles, Kemper's brigade was held in reserve at the Battle of Gaines's Mill. At the Battle of Glendale, the relatively inexperienced brigade spearheaded Longstreet's attack on the Union lines; prior to this, the only general engagement the brigade had faced took place during the Battle of Williamsburg almost two months earlier, when they had been under A.P. Hill's command. Kemper's brigade suffered the fewest losses out of Longstreet's six brigades during the week-long confrontation. Following the Seven Days, General Robert E. Lee reorganized the army, and Kemper became a temporary division commander, commanding half of Longstreet's former division.\n\nAt the Second Battle of Bull Run, Kemper's division took part in Longstreet's surprise attack against the Union left flank, almost destroying Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia. Following Second Bull Run, the more senior Brigadier General David R. Jones took over command of the division, while Kemper reverted to brigade command. At the Battle of Antietam, Kemper was positioned south of the town of Sharpsburg, defending against Major General Ambrose E. Burnside's assault in the afternoon of September 17, 1862. He withdrew his brigade in the face of the Union advance, exposing the Confederate right flank, and the line was saved only by the hasty arrival of A.P. Hill's division from Harpers Ferry.\n\nAnother army reorganization after Antietam led to Kemper's brigade being placed in a division commanded by Brigadier General George Pickett, who had been on medical leave since being wounded at Gaines Mill. The division was held in reserve at Fredericksburg, and during the spring of 1863 was on detached duty in the Richmond area. As a result, Kemper also missed the Chancellorsville Campaign.\n\nAt the Battle of Gettysburg, Kemper arrived with Pickett's division late on the second day of battle, July 2, 1863. His brigade was one of the main assault units in Pickett's Charge, advancing on the right flank of Pickett's line. After crossing the Emmitsburg Road, the brigade was hit by flanking fire from two Vermont regiments, driving it to the left and disrupting the cohesion of the assault. In spite of the danger, Kemper rose up in his stirrups to urge his men forwards, shouting \"There are the guns, boys, go for them!\"\n\nThis act of bravado made Kemper an obvious target, and he was wounded by a bullet in the abdomen and thigh before being captured by Union troops. However, he was rescued shortly thereafter by Sgt. Leigh Blanton of the First Virginia Infantry Regiment and carried back to the Confederate lines on Seminary Ridge. General Lee encountered Kemper being carried on a stretcher and inquired about the seriousness of his wound, which Kemper said he thought was mortal. He requested that Lee \"do full justice to this division for its work today.\" During the Confederate Army's retreat from Gettysburg, Kemper was again captured by Union forces. He was exchanged (for Charles K. Graham) on September 19, 1863. For the rest of the war he was too ill to serve in combat, and instead commanded the Reserve Forces of Virginia. He was promoted to major general on September 19, 1864.\n\nKemper was paroled in May 1865. Since his previous house had been destroyed in a raid led by Union officer George Armstrong Custer, his mother-in-law purchased a house for the family in Madison County. Kemper then resumed his legal career. However, the bullet that had wounded him at Gettysburg had lodged close to a major artery and could not be removed without risking his life, so he suffered groin pain for the rest of his life. Nonetheless, he tried to attract northern capital to rebuild the devastated local economy. He and former classmate and Confederate general John D. Imboden also maintained a general legal practice, which because of the times, included much bankruptcy law.\n\nBeginning in 1867, Kemper helped found Virginia's Conservative Party, initially to oppose the new state constitution adopted by a convention chaired by John Underwood (who allied with the Radical Republican faction and opposed allowing former Confederates the vote, among other measures). In 1869 Kemper allied with another former Confederate general turned railroad entrepreneur William Mahone to elect Gilbert C. Walker to the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nAfter his beloved wife Bella died in September 1870 of complications from the birth of their seventh child, Kemper's political activities increased. Distraught from the loss, he no longer slept in the house they had shared, but in his law office. Kemper ran for Congress in the 7th Congressional District (after the redistricting caused by the 1870 census), but lost to incumbent John T. Harris of Harrisonburg.\n\nIn the 1873 election for Governor of Virginia, as the Reconstruction Era ended and former Confederate soldiers regained voting rights, Kemper handily defeated former Know-Nothing and fellow ex-Confederate turned Republican Robert William Hughes of Abingdon, who won only 43.84% of the votes cast. Kemper's supporters included former Confederate Generals Jubal Early and Fitzhugh Lee as well as Mahone and noted raider John Singleton Mosby. However, former Governor and Confederate General Henry A. Wise supported Hughes.\n\nKemper served as Virginia's Governor from January 1, 1874, to January 1, 1878. He lived frugally, using his son Meade (d. 1886) as his secretary. Kemper trimmed the state budget where possible, and late in his term advocated taxing alcohol. One major political controversy involved whether to repay the state's war debt. Kemper allied with the Funder Party to pay it off; the Readjuster Party (which Mahone came to lead) opposed him. Gov. Kemper also enforced the civil rights provisions in the new state constitution, despite having opposed it originally. His February 1874 veto of a new law passed by the General Assembly that attempted to transfer control in Petersburg from elected officials (including African Americans) to a board of commissioners appointed by a judge was sustained by Virginia's Senate, although the law's proponents hanged him in effigy. General Early also vehemently disagreed with Kemper's 1875 decision to allow a militia unit of African Americans to participate in the dedication of a statue of General Stonewall Jackson. Gov. Kemper also attempted prison reform and built public schools despite budget shortages. His last major public reception, in October 1877, hosted President Rutherford B. Hayes who opened the state fair in Richmond. One modern historian analogized Kemper's Conservative philosophy (and that of other Virginia Redeemers) to that of Gov. Wade Hampton of South Carolina.\n\nAs his term of office ended (the state Constitution forbidding his re-election), Kemper (with his six surviving children and various domestic animals) returned to farming and his legal practice. He sold the Madison County home and purchased a house known as Walnut Hills, which overlooked the Rapidan River and Blue Ridge Mountains and was near the Orange County courthouse. However, complications from the inoperable bullet worsened, and eventually paralyzed his left side. Kemper died on April 7, 1895 and was buried in the family cemetery.\n\nVirginia erected a historic marker at Kemper's former home, which has now been restored by the Madison County Historical Society and other organizations, and is available for receptions and other activities. It is part of the Madison Courthouse historic district. His papers are held by the Library of Virginia.\n\nBecause Kemper (like Mahone) supported education of African-Americans, some schools for African-Americans founded during his governorship were named after him, including Kemper School No. 4 in the Arlington District of Alexandria County, Virginia.\n\nAlso, the Kemper Street Industrial Historic District in Lynchburg, Virginia straddles the former Lynchburg and Durham Railroad, construction of which began in May, 1887; the Norfolk and Southern Railroad acquired the line in 1898, which spurred that district's industrial growth.\n\nActor Royce D. Applegate portrayed Kemper in two films, \"Gettysburg\" (1993) and \"Gods and Generals\" (2003).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1815969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815969", "title": "Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit", "text": "Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are an enumeration of seven spiritual gifts originating from patristic authors, later elaborated by five intellectual virtues and four other groups of ethical characteristics. They are: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.\n\nThe seven gifts are found in the Book of Isaiah , where the Biblical passage refers to the characteristics of a Messianic figure understood by Christians to be Jesus Christ empowered by the \"Spirit of the Lord\".\n\nIn the Hebrew Masoretic text the \"Spirit of the Lord\" is described with six characteristics (wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, fear of the Lord), and then the last characteristic (fear of the Lord) is mentioned a second time.\n\nIn the Greek Septuagint the first mention of the fear of the Lord is translated as \"spirit of [...] godliness\" (\"πνεῦμα\" [...] \"εὐσεβείας\").\n\nThe seven Latin terms are then: \n\nThe \"Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit\" is one of several works in Christian devotional literature which follow a scheme of seven. Others include the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer, the beatitudes, the seven last words from the cross, the seven deadly sins, and the seven virtues.\n\nThe seven gifts were often represented as doves in medieval texts and especially figure in depictions of the Tree of Jesse which shows the Genealogy of Jesus. For Saint Thomas Aquinas, the dove signifies by its properties each gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\nAlthough the New Testament does not refer to Isaiah 11:1-2 regarding these gifts, Roman Catholicism teaches that initiates receive them at Baptism and that they are strengthened at Confirmation, so that one can proclaim the truths of the faith: \"The reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace.\" For \"by the sacrament of Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they are, as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and .\" According to the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", these gifts \"complete and perfect the virtues of those who receive them.\"\n\nWisdom is considered the first and the greatest of the gifts. It acts upon both the intellect and the will. According to St. Bernard, it both illumines the mind and instills an attraction to the divine. Adolphe Tanquerey OP explained the difference between the gift of wisdom and that of understanding: \"The latter is a view taken by the mind, while the former is an experience undergone by the heart; one is light, the other love, and so they unite and complete one another.\" A wise and loving heart is the perfection of the theological virtue of charity.\n\nUnderstanding helps one relate all truths to one's supernatural purpose; it further illuminates one's understanding of Sacred Scripture; and it assists us to understand the significance of religious ritual. This all gives us a profound appreciation for God’s providence.\n\nCounsel functions as a sort of supernatural intuition, to enable a person to judge promptly and rightly, especially in difficult situations. It perfects the cardinal virtue of prudence. While prudence operates in accord with reason as enlightened by faith, the gift of counsel operates under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to illuminate the will of God.\n\nFortitude is often identified with courage, but Aquinas takes its meaning to also encompass endurance. Joseph J. Rickaby describes it as a willingness to stand up for what is right in the sight of God, even if it means accepting rejection, verbal abuse, or physical harm. The gift of fortitude allows people the firmness of mind that is required both in doing good and in enduring evil. It is the perfection of the cardinal virtue of the same name.\n\nKnowledge: The gift of knowledge allows one, as far as is humanly possible, to see things from God's perspective. It “allows us to perceive the greatness of God and his love for his creatures” through creation.\n\nPiety accords with reverence. A person with reverence recognizes his total reliance on God and comes before God with humility, trust, and love. Thomas Aquinas says that piety perfects the virtue of religion, which is an aspect of the virtue of justice, in that it accords to God that which is due to God. In a series of talks on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, Pope Francis said that piety is a recognition of \"our belonging to God, our deep bond with him, a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute, in communion with him, even during the most difficult and troubled moments”. Francis goes on: \"Piety is not mere outward religiosity; it is that genuine religious spirit which makes us turn to the Father as his children and to grow in our love for others, seeing them as our brothers and sisters.\"\n\nFear of the Lord is akin to wonder (or awe). With the gift of fear of the Lord, one is made aware of the glory and majesty of God. At a June 2014 general audience Pope Francis said that it “is no servile fear, but rather a joyful awareness of God’s grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our hearts find true peace”. A person with wonder and awe knows that God is the perfection of all one’s desires. This gift is described by Aquinas as a fear of separating oneself from God. He describes the gift as a \"filial fear,\" like a child's fear of offending his father, rather than a \"servile fear,\" that is, a fear of punishment. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. It is the perfection of the theological virtue of hope.\n\nIn \"Summa Theologiae\" I.II, q. 68, a1, Saint Thomas Aquinas says that four of these gifts (wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and counsel) direct the intellect, while the other three gifts (fortitude, piety, and fear of the Lord) direct the will toward God.\n\nIn some respects, the gifts are similar to the virtues, but a key distinction is that the virtues operate under the impetus of human reason (prompted by grace), whereas the gifts operate under the impetus of the Holy Spirit; the former can be used when one wishes, but the latter, according to Aquinas, operate only when the Holy Spirit wishes. In the case of Fortitude, the gift has, in Latin and English, the same name as the virtue which it is related to, but from which it must be distinguished.\n\nIn \"Summa Theologiae\" II.II, Thomas Aquinas asserts the following correspondences between the seven Capital Virtues and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit:\n\nTo the virtue of temperance, no Gift is directly assigned; but the gift of fear can be taken as such, since fear drives somebody to restrict himself from forbidden pleasures.\n\nThe Rev. Brian Shanley contrasts the gifts to the virtues this way: \"What the gifts do over and above the theological virtues (which they presuppose) is dispose the agent to the special promptings of the Holy Spirit in actively exercising the life of the virtues; the gifts are necessary for the perfect operations of the virtues, especially in the face of our human weakness and in difficult situations.\"\n\nSaint Augustine drew a connection between the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the Beatitudes (Matt.5:3-12).\n\n\n"}

The film's graphic violence, and nude scenes, as well as its lavish cinematography and formalism, were noted at the time of its release.\n\nEnglish gangster Albert Spica has taken over the high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, managed by French chef Richard Boarst. Spica makes nightly appearances at the restaurant with his retinue of thugs. His oafish behavior causes frequent confrontations with the staff and his own customers, whose patronage he loses, but whose money he seems not to miss.\n\nForced to accompany Spica is his reluctant, well-bred wife, Georgina, who soon catches the eye of a quiet regular at the restaurant, bookshop owner Michael. Under her husband's nose, Georgina carries on an affair with Michael with the help of the restaurant staff. Ultimately Spica learns of the affair, forcing Georgina to hide out at Michael's book depository. Boarst sends food to Georgina through his young employee Pup, a boy soprano who sings while working. Spica tortures the boy before finding the bookstore's location written in a book the boy is carrying. Spica's men storm Michael's bookshop while Georgina is visiting the boy in hospital. They torture Michael to death by force-feeding him pages from his books. Georgina discovers his body when she returns.\n\nOvercome with rage and grief, she begs Boarst to cook Michael's body, and he eventually complies. Together with all the people that Spica wronged throughout the film, Georgina confronts her husband finally at the restaurant and forces him at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of Michael's cooked body. Spica obeys, gagging. Georgina then shoots him in the head, calling him a cannibal.\n\nPeter Greenaway has said that the Jacobean play \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\" provided him with the main template for his screenplay.\n\nMichael Nyman's score prominently incorporated his 1985 composition \"Memorial\".\n\nJean-Paul Gaultier designed the costumes. Italian chef Giorgio Locatelli prepared the food used as props.\n\nThe film debuted at the 1989 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on 13 October 1989 in London on two screens. It grossed over $500,000 in London. During its opening week in Paris it grossed $158,500.\n\nMiramax acquired the rights for $500,000, and released the film in New York on 6 April 1990. It was Greenaway's first film to be released fully in the US since \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" in 1982. It grossed $7.7 million in the US.\n\nThe film's original running time was 124 minutes. Due to the content, the MPAA gave Miramax a choice of either an X rating or go unrated (adults only) for theatrical release. Unrated was chosen in light of the X rating being more associated with pornographic films. Two versions of the film were released on VHS in the 1990s. One was an R-rated cut running 95 minutes (mainly for large video store chains); the other was the original version.\n\nThe film received largely positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it currently holds an 85% score based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 7.37/10. The site's consensus states: \"This romantic crime drama may not be to everyone's taste, but \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\" is an audacious, powerful film.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four out of four stars, noting that the film's raw emotion and violent interpersonal conflict was a departure from Greenaway's typically cerebral and intellectual films.\n\nThe film has had a lasting influence on Ari Aster, filmmaker and director of critically acclaimed 2018 horror/drama film \"Hereditary\". Of \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, & Her Lover,\" Aster has said “I regretted watching it for many years. There’s something so upsetting to me about the level of artifice in this film, from Sacha Vierny’s cinematography to Jean-Paul Gaultier’s costumes. What you’re left with is Greenaway’s wholesale disgust with the human race.\"\n\n\"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\" is the twelfth album release by Michael Nyman and the ninth to feature the Michael Nyman Band. The album includes the first commercially released recording of Nyman's composition \"Memorial\".\n\nThere is some music not included on the soundtrack album: the love theme for Michael and Georgina, which is \"Fish Beach\" from \"Drowning by Numbers\", the song performed as a show in the restaurant, sung by actress and singer Flavia Brilli, or a doubly pulsed variation of \"Memorial\" that occurs about halfway through the film. Edits of \"Memorial\" appear throughout the film, with the entire twelve-minute movement accompanying the final scene and end credits, but one variation is uniquely created for the film.\n\nThe filming is inspired by Flemish Baroque painting as Peter Paul Rubens or Anthony van Dyck. The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616, a painting by Frans Hals appears on the restaurant wall.\n\n"}

It is a narrow saltwater bar-bounded estuary sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by Anastasia Island.\n\nThe Matanzas River is in length and extends from St. Augustine Inlet southward to approximately south of the Matanzas Inlet on the southern tip of Anastasia Island. The river is part of the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe Matanzas River at St. Augustine was the main entrance to the historic city, America's oldest port. The body of water is often referred to as the Matanzas Harbor in the immediate vicinity of the city's waterfront. The southern portion of the Matanzas River was traditionally considered the \"backdoor\" to the city of St. Augustine, and control of the river was considered a strategic necessity for early Spanish colony at St. Augustine. Spanish engineers and laborers built Fort Matanzas in the 18th century to control access to the river from Matanzas Inlet, about south of St. Augustine.\n\nThe Matanzas River supports an extensive tidal marsh habitat. Extensive conservation efforts including the Matanzas marsh, Faver-Dykes State Park, Princess Place preservation area, Pellicer Place preservation area, Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve, the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve, and the Moses Creek conservation area have been established to preserve the ecosystem. The preserved areas include salt marshes, mangrove tidal wetlands, oyster bars, estuarine lagoons, upland habitat, and marine environments. The Matanzas River faces several pollution issues, mostly related to urbanization in St. Augustine and the northern portion of Anastasia Island.\n\nTwo major bridges cross the Matanzas River, the Bridge of Lions and the Mickler-O'Connell Bridge, both between St. Augustine and Anastasia Island.\n\nThe Matanzas River was named by Spanish forces for a massacre, led by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés of Spain, of a group of several hundred shipwrecked French Huguenots from Fort Caroline, led by Jean Ribault. The Huguenots were executed somewhere near the present site of Matanzas Inlet in 1565. Menéndez had been ordered to kill all Protestants he found in the New World. \"Matanzas\" means \"killings\" or \"slaughters\" in Spanish. Matanzas is thus the tenth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.\n\n"}

It was built between 1356 and 1363 during the Bahri Mamluk period, commissioned by Sultan an-Nasir Hasan. The mosque was considered remarkable for its massive size and innovative architectural components, and is still considered one of the most impressive historic monuments in Cairo today.\n\nSultan al-Nasir Hasan (full name: \"An-Nasir Badr ad-Din Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Qalawun\") ascended the throne at the age of 13 in 748 AH/1347 CE. When he reached maturity in 1350, he arrested the Emir Manjaq who controlled all of the state's affairs. Prior to that arrest, the emir was restricted to an allowance of just one hundred dirham per day. This pocket change was collected by servants for the Sultan. It's especially striking considering that during that time, the emir Shaykhu was estimated to have an income of 200,000 dirham per day. This deprivation may be viewed as a prompt for his later extravagance. Upon taking over the reins, Sultan Hasan placed people of his own favor into positions of power. This happened at the expense of dignitaries currently in position; it upset many of them. Discontented Emirs arrested the Sultan in 1351, held him in jail for three years, and promoted his brother as-Salih Salih to the throne. Hasan spent his time in jail studying and his obituaries commented on his learning as a result. He returned to power and again reshuffled the ruling establishment attempting to solidify power, but Sultan Hasan was assassinated by his commander in chief of the army, Yalbugha al-Umari, a Mamluk thought to be loyal. Because of the Sultan's extravagance in spending fortunes on women and other forms of favoritism, the commander rebelled against the Sultan. A contemporary Syrian historian, Ibn Kathir, backed this reputation. Ibn Kathir blamed the sultan for his greed and squandering of public funds. The lavish expenses noted coincide with the Sultan's extensive mosque. After his assassination in 1361, Sultan Hasan's body was never found; the mausoleum never served its purpose.\n\nThe mosque's construction is considered all the more remarkable as it coincided with the devastation wrought by the Black Plague, which struck Cairo repeatedly from the mid-14th century onwards. Its construction began in 1356 CE (757 AH) and work proceeded for three years \"without even a single day of idleness\". In fact, work appears to have continued even up to 1363, even after Sultan Hasan's death, before eventually ceasing. An inscription on the mosque notes the name of amir Muhammad ibn Biylik al-Muhsini as the supervisor of the construction of the mosque. Unusually, his name was placed near Sultan Hasan's in the inscription, which demonstrates how important the undertaking of the project must have been. The amir's high standing otherwise was another indication of this prestige, as he was appointed governor of Cairo in 1330 and oversaw other construction projects including the renovation of the hippodrome established by al-Zahir Baybars near the Citadel.\n\nThe most substantial available source concerning the mosque's construction is al-Maqrizi, writing six decades afterwards, as he had access to administrative documents that are unavailable to historians today. The manual labour needed for construction must have been partly depleted by the ongoing ravages of the plague, yet this does not appear to have been the main challenge. Maqrizi mentions that the construction of the mosque cost 30,000 dirham every day. The total construction costs amounted to over one million dinars, making it the most expensive mosque in medieval Cairo. Even the Sultan is said to have become discouraged at times by the cost of the project. Financing for the mosque was made possible by a few factors: first, the austerity measures implemented by Manjaq, one of the amirs in charge of state affairs before Sultan Hasan reached maturity; secondly, the influx of wealth to the state caused by the plague-related deaths of many Mamluk amirs whose properties were subsequently transferred to the state treasury, including the enormous wealth of amir Shaykhu; and thirdly, through extortion of the sultan's subjects during his reign. \n\nThe importance and scale of the building project also attracted craftsmen from all over the Mamluk empire, including the far-away provinces of Anatolia, which may explain the diversity and innovativeness of the mosque's design and decoration. It is also believed that limestone from the Pyramids of Giza was quarried for use in the mosque's construction.\n\nDue to the mosque's location near the Citadel and because of its massive and sturdy construction, it was used on more than one occasion as a fortified position or as a platform from which to launch attacks on the Citadel. Al-Maqrizi, noted that \"as soon as there occurred strife between the people the state, a number of amirs and others ascended to the top of the mosque and began to bombard the Citadel from there\". This, in turn, persuaded more than one sultan to order the mosque to be demolished or blocked up. In 1391, rebel amirs against Sultan Barquq mounted the roof of the mosque and launched projectiles at the Citadel, provoking the sultan into ordering the stairs and platform of the entrance destroyed and the doorway boarded up. In 1500, Sultan Janbalat, anticipating another rebel attack from the mosque, ordered it demolished; however, after three days of unsuccessful demolition attempts on the mosque's southeastern (Citadel-facing) walls, he was forced to give up. In 1517, the very last Mamluk sultan, Tumanbay, took refuge inside the mosque in an attempt to evade capture by the victorious Ottoman army as it took control of Cairo, resulting in the Ottomans bombarding the mosque with cannonballs from the Citadel. In 1660, chronicles described the mausoleum's dome as still being full of holes made by cannonballs. Even in the 18th century, during the period of Ottoman control, the mosque was apparently closed for many years after unrest in 1736, and was only reopened in 1786 by order of Salim Agha. Some of these demolition attempts, however, drew criticism from Cairo's population and authorities were often subsequently pressured into repairing damages.\n\nIn 1659, the northern minaret attached to the mausoleum collapsed. In 1671-1672, the minaret was replaced with a smaller one, with a slightly different form, and at same time the original wooden dome of the mausoleum was replaced with the current dome, also in a different shape from the original.\n\nIn 1869 century construction began on a monumental new mosque, the Mosque of ar-Rifa'i, right next to the existing mosque of Sultan Hasan. Completed in 1912, its size is comparable to Sultan Hasan's construction and it was built in a neo-Mamluk style. The two buildings together now dominate the old Rumayla Square (now renamed Midan Salah ad-Din) across from the Citadel.\n\nThe mosque occupies almost 8000 square meters in a location close to the Citadel of Cairo. It stands on the site of a lavish palace which had previously been built at great cost by Hasan's father, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, for one of his amirs, Yalbugha al-Yahawi, and which was demolished to make way for the mosque. The construction of monumental buildings on this location was likely meant in part to create a pleasing sight for the Sultan to look down on from his palace in the Citadel. \n\nDuring the medieval era, an open square, known as Rumayla, lay between the mosque and the Citadel. Today the square is occupied by a large traffic circle and has been renamed Salah ad-Din Square. The square and the former hippodrome nearby (on the southwestern side of the Citadel) were historically used for military parades, equestrian games, and official ceremonies, thus giving the location added symbolic significance.\n\nThe building is about 500 meters long, 68 meters wide, and 36 meters high. Like all mosques, it is oriented towards Mecca, which is to the southeast of Cairo. The building's southwestern and northeastern facades (its longer sides) are marked by vertical rows of eight windows each (spread across four stories inside) which are a unique feature that helps to visually emphasize the structure's height. The top edge of the exterior facades are crowned by a thick cornice of muqarnas (stalactite-like carving) projecting 1.5 meters over the rest of the wall, another unprecedented feature in Mamluk architecture, although it does not extend around the entire building. Likewise, a crest of fleur-de-lis-shaped crenelations also ran along the whole length at the very top edge of the walls, but today it is only preserved around the mausoleum's walls on the southeastern side. The southeastern or Citadel-facing walls of the mosque and mausoleum have windows framed by more elaborate stone decoration in various patterns. The triangular-shaped spaces above the bottom windows here were once filled with geometric ceramic decoration, possibly of Anatolian Turkish inspiration.\n\nNear the bottom of the southwestern wall, below today's street level, is a row of stone corbels projecting from the wall which likely served to support the roof of a covered market along the street on this side.\n\nThe mosque today has two minarets flanking the mausoleum chamber on the southeastern side of the structure. The southern one of this pair, which is still in its original form, is the highest minaret of Mamluk architecture, its summit being 84 meters above the street level at the time. The northern one collapsed in 1659 and was rebuilt in its current form in 1671-72. The original northern minaret was said to be more monumental, and its summit was \"double-headed\"; in other words, it culminated in two lantern structures (instead of the usual one), a feature that reappeared much later in the minaret of Sultan al-Ghuri at the al-Azhar Mosque and in the minaret of the nearby Mosque of Qanibay ar-Rammah.\n\nAdditionally, two more minarets were originally intended to stand above the monumental portal of the mosque, very much like in the architecture of Mongol Ilkhanid and Anatolian Seljuk madrasas and mosques around the same period (for example, the Gök Madrasa in Sivas, Turkey, or the Great Mosque of Yazd, Iran), which were almost certainly an inspiration. This would have given the mosque a total of four minarets, which would have been unprecedented in Islamic architecture in Egypt. However, in 1361, during construction, one of those minarets toppled and killed around 300 people, including children in the primary school below. After this, the builders abandoned their construction, leaving only the two minarets adjacent to the mausoleum that we see today.\n\nThe entrance portal is gigantic by the standards of mosque architecture and is 38 meters high. It was built at an angle projecting 17 degrees outwards from the rest of the wall so as to be visible from the Citadel. Its shape and the layout of its decoration indicate obvious inspiration from the portals of madrasas and mosques in Anatolian Seljuk and Mongol Ilkhanid architecture of the time, particularly the portal of the Gök (Blue) Madrasa in Sivas, Turkey, built in 1271. On the inside of the portal, behind the stone benches and flanking the doorway, are a pair of marble niches filled with geometric patterns reminiscent of Qur'an illumination and culminating in shallow muqarnas hoods (also Anatolian in style). Above these are black marble panels inlaid with white Kufic Arabic inscriptions of parts of the \"Surat al-Fath\" (Sura of Victory) from the Qur'an. The \"Shahada\" (the Muslim declaration of faith) is inscribed in \"square\" Kufic higher up above this, while further up is a band of inscription containing another Quranic verse (24:36-37), running along the full width of the inside of the portal, just below the muqarnas canopy.\n\nThe decoration of the portal was apparently never finished. There are many examples of stone carvings whose initial outlines were drawn into the stone but were never carved out. The broad and impressive muqarnas canopy over the doorway does not appear to be fully carved out either, while above this a section of stone cladding appears to be missing. Other bands of stone-carved decoration were only partially executed. For example, at the foot of the decorative niche on the left side of the portal one arabesque medallion was carved on the left while the one on the right was not. (This is also a rare demonstration of the steps in the stone-carving process: it is likely that a master craftsman drew the outlines of the pattern into the stone and that apprentices were later responsible for carving it out; in this case, the second step was not completed.) Some of the carved patterns, even if unfinished, are themselves notable; for example, there are floral chinoiserie motifs here which appear in other Mamluk crafts of the time but do not appear anywhere else in Mamluk architecture. Another minor but curious feature is the sculpted image of other architectural buildings in some of the carvings just above the stairs leading up to the portal; these are possibly spoils from a Gothic-style Christian monument, presumably from Crusader churches located on the estates donated to the madrasa-mosque's foundation.\n\nThe original bronze-covered doors of the entrance were forcibly purchased at a modest price by Sultan Mu'ayyad in the early 15th century for use on his own mosque, and can still be seen there today.\n\nAlthough the exterior walls of the building are in stone, much of the interior is brick, with facades covered in stucco and finished with stonework for decorative details.\n\nThe vestibule chamber upon entering the mosque is an unusually ornate space, covered by a small central dome surrounded by elaborate muqarnas vaults. The dome and half-dome arrangement here is reminiscent of Byzantine architecture, but may have been inspired from Armenian craftsmanship, if not original. The back wall facing the doorway is covered in marble paneling: in the middle is a square panel made of inlaid white and red marble in a geometric pattern of Syrian style, while on either side are marble panels with other carved patterns. From this chamber, a bending passage leads to the central courtyard. \n\nAlso located behind the walls of the vestibule on the floor plan is a space which may have once housed, or was intended to house, a doctor and medical students, as mentioned in the foundation (waqf) document. The space is now ruined, or might have never been finished. \n\nThe enormous central courtyard is a vast square space surrounded by four monumental iwans (vaulted chambers open on one side), of which the qibla iwan (the iwan in the direction of prayer) is larger than the other three. This space acted as a Friday mosque accessible to the public, but it was also used for teaching by the madrasas that were part of the foundation. The four iwans are said to have each been devoted to the teaching of one of the four maddhabs (schools of thought) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence: the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafi'i maddhabs. \n\nThe size of the main qibla iwan was frequently acknowledged as an awe-inspiring achievement, with Mamluk historians like Maqrizi claiming it was greater than the famous arch of the Sassanid Persian palace of Ctesiphon (still the largest single-span vault of brickwork in the world today). The iwan of Sultan Hasan's mosque is not actually as large as that arch, but the comparison nonetheless emphasized the building's legendary reputation. This iwan is also richly decorated. A monumental inscription in Kufic style, set against a swirling vegetal arabesque background, runs along the entire length of the iwan and is unique in Mamluk architecture. The text is a fragment of the \"Surat al-Fath\" (Sura of Victory) from the Qur'an. Below this inscription band, the qibla wall is covered in multicolored marble paneling, centered around the mihrab (the niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) which is framed by its own golden inscription and whose central half-dome hood features a sunrise motif radiating from the word \"Allah\". The stone and marble minbar (pulpit) next to it may have once been covered in inlaid geometric patterns like that on the minbar of the Mosque of Aqsunqur, but this is not visible today. The minbar does still feature finely-crafted bronze doors with geometric patterns. A dado of marble also runs along the other two walls of the iwan, although at a much shorter height. A stone platform, known as a \"dikkat\", stands in the middle of the space and was where reciters of the Qur'an would recite aloud for communal prayers.\n\nThe floor of the central courtyard is paved in rich marble mosaics. The pavement dates from a restoration by the \"Comité\" in 1912, but the patterns may well be from Sultan Hasan's time. The domed pavilion at the center of the courtyard shelters an ablutions fountain (for washing before prayer), but it was originally meant to be only a decorative fountain (ablutions facilities were once located next to the mosque building). The domed structure itself is made of wood and has likely been repaired or restored many times. Its current shape may date from Ottoman times, but it may also be the earliest Mamluk example of this type of fountain.\n\nThe other three iwans and the rest of the courtyard are largely plain except for the doorways at the corners of the courtyard. These lead to the madrasa units and with their own smaller courtyards. The doorways are framed in ablaq stonework, bands of stone inscriptions, and colored mosaics. It is possible that the other iwans were intended to be decorated too but were never finished. Additionally, a marked-out but empty band running along the top edge of the entire courtyard, above the iwans, may have been intended for another monumental inscription.\n\nThe doors in the corners of the main courtyard each lead to one of the four madrasa devoted to one of the four maddhabs (schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence). Each was centered on a small courtyard surrounded by four stories of living quarters and cells for students. The madrasas were not of equal size (at least in part because of the irregular floor plan of the mosque, which was limited by existing streets and structures), with the Hanafi and Shafi'i madrasas being the largest, located on either side of the great iwan of the main mosque.\n\nThese madrasa areas were almost entirely separate from the central courtyard (aside from the doorways leading to them), unlike in other madrasas were the rooms of the students often had windows overlooking the main courtyard. This may have been because the main courtyard was used as a mosque by members of the public and a greater measure of privacy or tranquility was desired for the students. Each madrasa courtyard also had its own smaller iwan used for prayers and oriented towards the qibla (direction of prayer), which was decorated by a stucco inscription band much like the one in the great qibla-side iwan of the main mosque.\n\nThe position of the mausoleum relative to the rest of the building was unusual in that it was located directly behind the qibla wall of the mosque, meaning it stood in the direction towards which Muslims in the mosque would pray. This is something not found in any other Mamluk religious building, though there is apparently no evidence that this was seen as controversial at the time. This layout had the consequence of making the mausoleum project outwards into Rumayla square and towards the Citadel, probably to make it more prominent when seen from the Citadel. The mausoleum chamber is accessed from inside the mosque, through a doorway to the left of the mihrab in the qibla wall. On the same wall, on the right side, there is a large, door-sized window which also opens to the mausoleum chamber. This window is distinguished by a set of doors which are notable for their exceptionally fine craftsmanship, made from copper-niello, inlaid with gold and silver, and featuring geometric star patterns and Thuluth-style Arabic inscriptions.\n\nInside, the chamber is even more lavishly decorated, with multicolored marble mosaic paneling on the lower walls and a large painted inscription of the Throne Verse, carved in wood, running around the entire chamber above this. The marble mihrab is similar to the one in the main qibla iwan of mosque. The square chamber transitions gradually to the round dome (12 meters in diameter) with the use of wooden pendentives, typical of Mamluk architecture, which are sculpted into muqarnas forms and richly painted and gilded. The cenotaph at the middle of the mausoleum chamber is dated to 1384, but Sultan Hasan's body was never found after he was killed, and as such he was never buried here. The mausoleum is also furnished with a large wooden lectern decorated with geometric star patterns and inlaid with ivory, which was meant to hold one of the giant royal copies of the Qur'an owned by the foundation.\n\nThe dome of the mausoleum chamber, visible from outside and from the Citadel, is no longer original but was replaced with the current one in 1671. This might have been due to damage from the fallen minaret in 1659 or from cannonballs fired from the Citadel in times of conflict. The original dome was also made of wood, despite the heavy buttressed walls of the chamber being able to support something heavier. The original dome had a very different shape, however. An Italian traveler in the early 17th century described it as being shaped like an egg; more specifically, it started narrow at the bottom then swelled out like a bulb, before finishing in a pointed tip.\n\nThe northwestern side of the mosque-madrasa is currently occupied by ruins and excavated remains. A primary school (maktab) once stood on this side, as well as a set of latrines and ablutions fountains. A row of arched rooms or units is also visible, and may have been used for shops as part of a weapons market. There was also a rectangular pool and a waterwheel, probably part of a pre-existing water aqueduct system which brought water to the royal stables of the Citadel.\n\n\n\n"}

His younger sister was fellow author Amy Wallace, a \"witch\" of Carlos Castaneda who co-wrote many books with him and their father and authored \"Sorcerer's Apprentice: My Life with Carlos Castaneda\" in 2003.\n\nOne day, after he got off an airplane in Britain, the customs officer looked at his passport and remarked, \"Ah Wallace, a good Scottish boy coming home.\" Disquieted, back in the States he discovered that the original family name was Wallechinsky and he adopted that moniker. He was educated at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, graduating in 1965. One of his classmates was future film critic and talk radio host Michael Medved, and they later wrote \"What Really Happened to the Class of '65\", a series of interviews with their former classmates. Alone, Wallechinsky went back to his school year and wrote a similar book \"Midterm Report: The Class of '65: Chronicles of an American Generation\" about pupils from across America who left high school in that year.\n\nIn 1973, Wallechinsky grew dismayed with almanacs that, in his opinion, rehashed bare facts. He began developing an idea for a reference book to be read for pleasure, that would include lesser-known history. He worked on the book for a year, before being joined by his father for an additional year of research. \"The People's Almanac\" was published by Doubleday in 1975 and became a best-seller. One of the most popular chapters was a selection of lists, leading Wallechinsky (in conjunction with his father and sister Amy) to write \"The Book of Lists\", which became an international best-seller. Both books spawned not only follow-up editions but copycat titles such as \"The Ethnic Almanac\", \"The Jewish Almanac\", and \"The Book Of TV Lists\".\n\nIn 1960, Wallechinsky was taken to the Rome Olympic Games by his father. In 1984, he published the first edition of his work \"The Complete Book of the Olympics\", a reference work with full results and many anecdotes about the modern Games. The book became unwieldy so was later split into two volumes \"The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics\" and \"The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics\" series. Wallechinsky now shares the editorial duties with his nephew Jaime Loucky. The books led to work for Wallechinsky as an Olympic commentator for NBC.\n\nIn 1992 he was one of the founding members of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH). He served as treasurer of the organization from 1996 to 2004, vice-president from 2004 to 2012 and is currently serving a four-year term as the organization's president.\n\nWallechinsky is the founder of AllGov.com, which provides news about various departments and agencies of the American government. AllGov describes the functions of each agency, their histories and controversies, and shares critiques and suggested reforms from both the left and the right.\n\nHe has compiled the list of \"The World’s 10 Worst Dictators\" for \"Parade\" magazine for a number of years. In 2006, this subject became a book entitled: \"Tyrants: The World’s 20 Worst Living Dictators\".\n\nWallechinsky is a vegetarian and is married to Flora Chavez. They have two sons: Elijah Chavez Wallechinsky (b. Los Angeles, June 3, 1983) and Aaron Chavez Wallechinsky (b. West Park Hospital, Canoga Park, Los Angeles, January 5, 1986). Both brothers are avid photographers and designers. Wallechinsky splits his time between Santa Monica, California and the south of France.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1815987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815987", "title": "Selimiye Mosque, Edirne", "text": "Selimiye Mosque, Edirne\n\nThe Selimiye Mosque () is an Ottoman imperial mosque, which is located in the city of Edirne (formerly Adrianople), Turkey is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Selim II, and was built by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan between 1568 and 1575. It was considered by Sinan to be his masterpiece and is one of the highest achievements of Islamic architecture.\n\nThis grand mosque stands at the center of a \"külliye\" (complex of a hospital, school, library and/or baths around a mosque) which comprises a medrese (Islamic academy teaches both Islamic and scientific lessons), a \"dar-ül hadis\" (Al-Hadith school), a timekeeper's room and an arasta (row of shops). In this mosque Sinan employed an octagonal supporting system that is created through eight pillars incised in a square shell of walls. The four semi domes at the corners of the square behind the arches that spring from the pillars, are intermediary sections between the huge encompassing dome ( diameter with spherical profile) and the walls.\n\nWhile conventional mosques were limited by a segmented interior, Sinan's effort at Edirne was a structure that made it possible to see the \"mihrab\" from any location within the mosque. Surrounded by four tall minarets, the Mosque of Selim II has a grand dome atop it. Around the rest of the mosque were many additions: libraries, schools, hospices, baths, soup kitchens for the poor, markets, hospitals, and a cemetery. These annexes were aligned axially and grouped, if possible. In front of the mosque sits a rectangular court with an area equal to that of the mosque. The innovation however, comes not in the size of the building, but from the organization of its interior. The mihrab is pushed back into an apse-like alcove with a space with enough depth to allow for window illumination from three sides. This has the effect of making the tile panels of its lower walls sparkle with natural light. The amalgamation of the main hall forms a fused octagon with the dome-covered square. Formed by eight massive dome supports, the octagon is pierced by four half dome covered corners of the square. The beauty resulting from the conformity of geometric shapes engulfed in each other was the culmination of Sinan's lifelong search for a unified interior space.\n\nAt the Bulgarian siege of Edirne in 1913, the dome of the mosque was hit by Bulgarian artillery. Owing to the dome's extremely sturdy construction, the mosque survived the assault with only minor damage. On Mustafa Kemal Pasha's order, it has not been restored since then, to serve as a warning for future generations. Some damage can be seen on the image of the dome above, at and near the dark red calligraph to the immediate left of the central blue area.\n\nIn the year 1865 Baha'u'llah,The founder of The Baha'i Faith, arrived with his family to Edirne as prisoner of the Ottoman empire and resided in a house near Selimiye Mosque, which he visited often until 1868. It was at Selimiye mosque where He was supposed to have an open debate with Mirza Yahya, an important historical event distinguishing the Baha'i faith from the covenant breakers guided by Mirza Yahia.\n\nSelimiye Mosque was built at the peak of Ottoman military and cultural power. As the empire started to grow, the emperor had found an immediate urge to centralize the city. Sinan was asked to help to construct the Selimiye Mosque, making the mosque distinctive and served the purpose of centralizing the city.\n\nLike all other Ottoman mosques in the earlier periods, the Selimiye Mosque had a multitude of little domes and half domes. However, the limit in building Selimiye was to viewing the mosque as a single unit from inside or outside rather than separate masses. Sinan believed that building a single dome would be the only resolution to achieve this. Hence, he ambitiously decided to replace the busy confused domes in the center with an enormous one. The author of Other Colors, Orhan Pamuk mentioned that he saw a connection between the wish of the central dome and the centralizing political and economic changes made by the empire, but the idea was later objected by another book written by Sinan’s friend, Sai, claiming that Sinan had taken his inspiration from Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia. Perhaps lending more credence to this idea is a quote by Sinan in which he claims that he has built a taller dome than Hagia Sophia: \"In this mosque...I [have] erected a dome six cubits higher and four cubits wider than the dome of Hagia Sophia.\"\n\nIn order to accentuate and draw attention to the centralize structure of the mosque, the traditional placement of different sized minarets was abandoned from the design as Sinan believed that cascade of smaller domes and half-domes used earlier would play down the gigantic single-shell dome. Besides, four identical minarets were planted at each corner of the marble forecourt to enforce attention on the surrounded central dome. The four vertically fluted symmetrical minarets amplify the upward thrust, shooting towards the sky like rockets from each corner of the mosque, according to Ottoman scholar Gulru Necipoglu. With the great dome rising subtlety from the center, it had harmoniously interplayed with the half domes, weight towers, and buttresses crowded around it. It was believed that the circular architecture was to affirm the oneness in humanity and called out the simple ideology of circle of life. The visible and invisible symmetries that were called out from the exterior and interior of the mosque was to evoke God’s perfection through the plain and powerful structure of the dome and the bare stone.\n\nThe interior of the mosque received great recognitions from its clean, spare lines in the structure itself. With the monumental exteriors proclaiming the wealth and power of the Ottoman Empire, the plain symmetrical interiors reminded the sultans should always provide a humble and faithful heart in order to connect and communicate with God. To enter, it was to forget the power, determination, wealth and technical mastery of the Ottoman Empire. Lights were seeped through multitude of tiny windows, and the interchanging of the weak light and dark was interpreted as the insignificance of humanity. The Selimiye did not only amaze the public with the extravagant symmetrical exterior, it had also astonished the people with the plain symmetrical interior for it had summarized all Ottoman architectural thinking in one simple pure form.\n\nThe mosque was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 10,000 lira banknotes of 1982-1995. The mosque, together with its \"külliye\", was included on UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2011.\n\n\n"}

It has its own executive committee, the president of which is also a sabbatical officer in the Union as the VP Sports & Leisure, and several of the teams compete in the National BUCS (formally BUSA) leagues. HUU is one of the few unions in the country to provide the sport - it is common for universities to offer it instead. There are recently created 3G football pitches, astroturf (known as Fort Inglemire) for hockey, two large sports halls, six squash courts which have been renovated in 2013 as it hosts an international tournament later in 2013 and a state of the art Sports Science facility. There is also a gym which has received heavy investment over the years and can cater for all students' needs.\n\nIn 2005, student rugby player Tom Ward lost his life, after participating in an initiation ceremony for new recruits to the rugby team. Tom was reported to have consumed over 30 units of alcohol in 3 hours. The initiation ceremony that Tom participated in was not atypical of the kind of \"Welcome Party\" that many new students at the University of Hull were expected to participate in.\nIn 2015, a ban on the practice of \"circling\" was introduced by HUU. This followed a number of incidents in which students were left traumatised by the behaviour of sports team committee members that were facilitating these practices.\n\nin 2018, it was discovered that Hull University Swimming Club had cheated at the A.U.'s annual varsity competition with Lincoln by entering ineligible swimmers. The team was made to forfeit the competition, after complaints were made to H.U.U. about participants that were not students at the University. \n\nHull University also had a campus in Scarborough until 2017, which was part of Hull University Union. The Union building was on the ground floor of the Scarborough Campus.\n\nHUUSC was run by an executive team, chaired by the VP Scarborough Campus, who was part of the HUU Union Executive Committee (UEC). This \"exec\", as it was known, was made up of five part-time volunteer student officers who were elected in week 5 of semester 2, alongside sabbatical officers. The roles were\nScarborough Education Officer, Scarborough Sports Officer, Scarborough Welfare Officer, Scarborough Community Officer and Scarborough Campaigns Officer.\n\nEach officer was responsible for a particular area of the Students' Union in Scarborough, and worked alongside their sabbatical colleagues from the Hull Campus to ensure that Scarborough Campus students had access to the same facilities, services and opportunities as their Hull-based counterparts.\n\nBassMent! Radio, Scarborough Campus's radio station, was a joint venture operated by HUUSC and Hull University's Creative Music Technology Department, housed across the road from the campus in the \"Filey Road Studios\" building.\n\nThe student magazine, \"Scarborough Tide\", was run by students and edited by the Scarborough Tide Editor. Responsibility for the Scarborough Tide lay ultimately on the shoulders of VP Scarborough as Editor in Chief.\n\nThere are many areas that students of Hull University can get involved in. Each area has its own Sabbatical officer or part-time UEO. The responsibilities of the officers of these areas and student opportunities are mentioned below.\n\nThe current set of responsibilities that the VP Education has are mainly the recruiting and guidance of:\n\nThis sabbatical officer also attends a large number of university committees so that the student voice can be heard. One of those committees is University Senate (one of the top committees in the University), of which, as well the VPE, the Union President, the VP Scarborough and VP Welfare and 6 elected Faculty Student Representatives and the Chair of the ISA attend to represent the Students to the top staff members of the University.\n\nRecent developments in this area include activities related to PDP, IT, the National Student Survey, improving representation on the Scarborough campus, mature students and eLearning.\n\nIn the past, this position was known as \"VP Education and Representation\" and \"VP Education & Welfare\". The Welfare responsibilities eventually separated from this role to become VP Welfare Support Services and later on, VP Welfare & Equality.\n\nThe sabbatical officer in charge of this area is responsible for:\n\nIn the past VP Media & Volunteering has been known as VP Media & Communications, VP Marketing & Communications and VP Services.\n\nThe sabbatical officer in charge of this area is responsible for the Advice Centre, Job shop, LINKS (An operational unit of St John Ambulance), LGBT+ Committee, the Women's Officer, BAME Officer and Students with Disabilities officer.\n\nVP Welfare also attends meetings of 'The Scheme' exec. The Scheme is a student accommodation setup in Hull to regulate landlords. However, the Union has recently noted that it will withdraw from 'The Scheme.'\n\nThis set of responsibilities used to be part of the role 'VP Education & Welfare' - a position seen in many student unions. However, due to the size of the remit, it split into two sabbatical positions several years ago (the other being VP Education).\n\nHull University Social Services Organisation/Student Community Action, often shortened to HUSSO, was formerly a registered charity in its own right. However, HUSSO is now a part of the HUU charity in the Community zone. It allows students to participate in a variety of activities which benefit the wider community (kids, older people, people with disabilities). Currently, there are over 200 volunteers involved in HUSSO. The Chair of HUSSO was formerly a part-time member of the Union Executive Committee but now is part of the Community Zone.\n\nCV is a referral service for students wishing to volunteer for external community projects (unlike HUSSO where the projects are student-led). There is a wide range of projects available and CV will offer support and advice to all volunteers using its services throughout their volunteering. CV is based in the Union on both Hull and Scarborough campuses.\n\nIn March 2011 the union was re-audited by the Student Union Evaluation Initiative after receiving a silver in 2008. In June 2011 it was announced that HUU had become the third student union to be awarded a Gold award in the UK, joining Sheffield and Leeds. Shortly after this Bath were also awarded Gold.\n\nIn May 2012 the Union was shortlisted for NUS HE innovative student engagement award at the NUS HE awards held in Nottingham and received the award for its work in using innovative techniques to engage traditionally hard to reach groups, techniques based upon monitoring of online memberships and online ticket purchases.\n\nIn July 2012 the Union was shortlisted for two NUS awards, the Community Relations Award and the Higher Education Student Union of the Year Award for the community work, academic wins such as the refurbishment of the library and the successful campaigns for changes to the Access Agreement and the continuation of lifelong learning. The Union received both awards at the awards night on 4 July at Exeter university.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1815995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815995", "title": "Evander M. Law", "text": "Evander M. Law\n\nEvander McIver Law (August 7, 1836 – October 31, 1920) was an author, teacher, and a Confederate general in the American Civil War.\n\nLaw was born in Darlington, South Carolina. His grandfather and his two great-grandfathers had fought in the American Revolutionary War under Francis Marion, the \"Swamp Fox\" guerrilla leader. He graduated from the South Carolina Military Academy (now The Citadel) in 1856 and was a professor of history at Kings Mountain Military Academy from 1858 to 1860, when he moved to Alabama to form his own Military High School in Tuskegee, Alabama.\n\nImmediately following Alabama's secession from the Union, Law joined the Alabama Militia as a captain. In April 1861 he transferred to the Confederate States Army as a captain in the 4th Alabama Infantry, a unit he helped recruit from students at his high school. The 4th Alabama was also known as the Alabama Zouaves\". The following month he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. At the First Battle of Bull Run he was in Brig. Gen. Barnard E. Bee's brigade. The colonel of his regiment was killed in action and Law was wounded in the arm. Law recovered, although his left arm was stiff and almost useless, and returned to the regiment. He was promoted to colonel on October 28, 1861, and assumed command of what would become known as the \"Alabama Brigade\" under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet in the Army of Northern Virginia in May 1862.\n\nLaw led his brigade through the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. At Gaines' Mill, he and fellow brigade commander Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood achieved fame by breaking the center of the Union line. They attacked in tandem again at the Battle of Malvern Hill four days later, but were defeated decisively. In the Northern Virginia Campaign, at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Law and Hood were used again as the primary assaulting force in Longstreet's surprise attack against the Union left flank, almost destroying Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia.\n\nIn the Maryland Campaign, at the Battle of Antietam, Law's Brigade defended against the Union attack through the Cornfield at high cost—454 killed and wounded. Law was promoted to brigadier general on October 3, 1862. At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, he saw little action.\n\nIn 1863, Law accompanied Longstreet's Corps to Suffolk, Virginia, which prevented his participation in the Battle of Chancellorsville. However, the corps returned to the Army of Northern Virginia in time for the Gettysburg Campaign. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Law's brigade fought in the unsuccessful assault on the Union left on July 2, 1863, on Little Round Top and the Devil's Den. He assumed temporary division command after John Bell Hood was wounded. Some historians have criticized Law for the lack of coordination that existed in Hood's division while he served as a temporary commander. Gettysburg historian Harry W. Pfanz suggested that Law's \"control of the division as a whole that afternoon was not very active and strong.\" He did not appoint his own successor at brigade command until after the fighting was over for the day, leaving his regiments without direction. None of Hood's other brigade commanders reported receiving any commands from Law during the battle.\n\nOn July 3, Law's men were at the extreme right of the Confederate line and defended against a suicidal cavalry attack made by Union troops of Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's division, led by their brigade commander Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth.\n\nLaw did not write an official report on the battle. Years later, he published his own account of the fighting on July 2, \"The Struggle For 'Round Top'\", in \"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War\".\n\nAfter Gettysburg, Longstreet's Corps was transported to the Western Theater to join General Braxton Bragg and the Army of Tennessee for victory at the Battle of Chickamauga. While Hood was present at Chickamauga, he served as a corps commander under Longstreet, who was acting as commander of a \"wing\" of the Army of Tennessee. As senior brigade commander, Law again acted as commander of Hood's division. On September 20, Hood's division, under Law, struck a gap in the Federal line and captured at least fifteen pieces of enemy artillery. Hood was severely wounded again that day, which should have left Law in command of Hood's division.\n\nDespite Longstreet's praise for Law's performances in previous battles, the two became involved in bitter disputes, some of which involved professional jealousy between Law and Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins, a favorite of Longstreet's. At different times and places, Longstreet had promised both Law and Jenkins command of Hood's division, should that command billet ever open. Law had served in Hood's division since its organization and had commanded it successfully at Gettysburg and Chickamauga. Jenkins was new to the division and had never commanded it, but his commission as a brigadier general pre-dated Law's, and when Jenkins's brigade was attached to Hood's division in September 1863, shortly after Chickamauga, with Hood absent due to wounds, Law had to turn command of Hood's division over to Jenkins.\n\nHood's division accompanied Bragg's army to the siege of Chattanooga. By late October 1863, Law's brigade was detached from Hood's division and the army, guarding Brown's Ferry over the Tennessee River in what is known as Lookout Valley. While Law was on leave, visiting the wounded Hood, division commander Jenkins stripped the defenses at Brown Ferry of over half the units, despite intelligence of enemy activity and pleas for reinforcements from Col. William C. Oates, commanding the 15th Alabama Regiment, one of the two regiments still posted near Brown's Ferry. On October 24, 1863, Union troops forced a passage of Brown's Ferry and overwhelmed its defenders. A few days later, Federal reinforcements— the XI and XII Corps from the Army of the Potomac— arrived at the other end of Lookout Valley, at Wauhatchie Station. The arrival of these fresh Federal troops, combined with the Federal possession of Brown's Ferry, enabled U.S. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to open his \"cracker line\" and feed his starving troops in Chattanooga.\n\nConfederate Gen. Bragg recognized that the \"cracker line\" would spell the end of the siege of Chattanooga, and on October 28, ordered Longstreet to take his corps and seize control of Lookout Valley. Longstreet decided to send only Hood's division to deal with the two enemy corps. Gen. Jenkins quickly planned a night attack on the railhead at Wauhatchie, to be made by two brigades, his own under Col. John Bratton, and Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning's. Simultaneous to the attack at Wauhatchie, and over a mile distant, a holding action near Brown's Ferry was to be made by the Texas brigade and Law's brigade. Already outnumbered, Jenkins further aggravated his situation by failing to utilize Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson's brigade, also of Hood's division, and a sizable portion of the Hampton Legion Infantry, of his own brigade. As the battle broke out, division commander Jenkins rode to Wauhatchie, on the extreme left of his widely dispersed division, instead of placing himself in a position where he could attempt to coordinate all of his troops. The ensuing engagement was a Confederate defeat. Jenkins later claimed that Law quit his holding mission prematurely; Law and Brig. Gen. Robertson, commanding the Texas brigade, claimed they acted in accordance with orders. This controversy brought tensions between Jenkins and Law to the boiling point, and has never been settled.\n\nJenkins continued in command of Hood's division through Longstreet's East Tennessee campaign of November– December 1863. Jenkins again blamed Law for the poor performance of the division, particularly at Campbell's Station. The command situation in Hood's division and Longstreet's Corps deteriorated markedly through March 1864, with Law, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, and at least one other brigadier general arrested and court-martialed by Longstreet; Longstreet's charges against his subordinates were not sustained by the Confederate War Department.\n\nThe continued stress resulted in Law's request for resignation, which he offered to deliver to Richmond in person. While there, he visited Hood, who talked Law out of resigning and used his influence to keep the War Department from accepting it. On Law's return to his brigade, still in East Tennessee, Longstreet ordered Law's arrest for insubordination. The men of Law's brigade had by this time had enough, and all but one of the colonels requested their regiments' transfer, with the whole brigade, to Alabama. Longstreet attempted to retaliate by leaving them in Tennessee when the rest of his corps rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia. General Robert E. Lee, however, ordered Law and the Alabamians back to his army. Hood had been promoted, and a new commander, Charles W. Field, was assigned to command Hood's old division, after which the division made a remarkable turn around, regaining in a month the efficiency it had last shown at Chickamauga.\n\nIn the Overland Campaign, on May 6, 1864, at the Wilderness, Law was under arrest in the rear, while his brigade participated in Longstreet's morning counterattack along the Orange Plank Road. The brigade continued to Spotsylvania Court House, but Law did not resume command until the Battle of Cold Harbor, where he received a gunshot wound that fractured his skull and injured his left eye.\n\nWhile his brigade fought in the Siege of Petersburg, Law was transferred to brigade command in Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton's Cavalry Corps. It was stationed in South Carolina, where he finished the war. When Maj. Gen. Matthew Butler was wounded at the Battle of Bentonville, Law exercised command of Butler's division until its commander returned to active duty. On March 20, 1865, he was promoted to the rank of Major General; but the promotion was too late to be confirmed by the Confederate Congress.\n\nAfter the war, Law administered the extensive agricultural holdings and railroad interests in his father-in-law's estate; he had married Jane Elizabeth Latta on March 9, 1863. He returned to Tuskegee in the late 1860s and organized the Alabama Grange in 1872. Law moved to Florida in 1881, planning to found a military academy that would be modeled after The Citadel. He opened the South Florida Military College at Bartow, Florida, in 1895 and administered it until 1903. There, and as a trustee of the Summerlin Institute from 1905 to 1912, and as a member of the Polk County Board of Education from 1912 until his death, he played a key role in the foundation of public education in Florida. He was the editor of the Bartow \"Courier Informant\" newspaper until 1915. He died in Bartow as the longest surviving Confederate major general, and is buried there in Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1816074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816074", "title": "Chinese Maritime Customs Service", "text": "Chinese Maritime Customs Service\n\nThe Chinese Maritime Customs Service was a Chinese governmental tax collection agency and information service from its founding in 1854 until it split in 1949 into services operating in the Republic of China on Taiwan, and in the People's Republic of China. From its foundation in 1854 until the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the agency was known as the Imperial Maritime Customs Service.\n\nFrom 1757 to signature of the Treaty of Nanking by the Chinese and British governments in 1842, all foreign trade in China operated through the monopoly Canton System centered on the Southern Chinese port of Canton (now Guangzhou). The treaty abolished this monopoly and opened the further ports of Shanghai, Amoy (Xiamen), Ningpo (Ningbo) and Foochow (Fuzhou) to international trade and brought with it the need for a mechanism to collect customs duties payable on business transacted in these places.\n\nLargely staffed at senior levels by foreigners, the Service was controlled by Chinese central government throughout its history. It was effectively established by foreign consuls in Shanghai in 1854 to collect maritime trade taxes that were going unpaid due to the inability of Chinese officials to collect them during the Taiping Rebellion. Its responsibilities soon grew to include domestic customs administration, postal administration, harbour and waterway management, weather reporting, and anti-smuggling operations. It mapped, lit, and policed the China coast and the Yangtze. It conducted loan negotiations, currency reform, and financial and economic management. The Service published monthly Returns of Trade, a regular series of Aids to Navigation and reports on weather and medical matters. It also represented China at over twenty world fairs and exhibition, ran some educational establishments, and conducted some diplomatic activities. Britons dominated the foreign staff of the Customs, but there were large numbers of German, U.S., French, and later Japanese staff amongst others. Promotion of Chinese nationals into senior positions started in 1929.\n\nAfter two decades of operation, the system collected about one third of the revenue available to the government in Beijing. In addition, foreign trade expanded rapidly because international trade was regulated and predictable. Foreign governments benefitted because there was a mechanism to collect revenues to repay the loans that they had imposed on or granted to China. By 1900, there were 20,000 people working in forty main Customs Houses across China and many more subsidiary stations.\n\nThe agency's first Inspector-General (IG), Horatio Nelson Lay (), was dismissed in 1863 following a dispute with the Imperial court to be replaced by Sir Robert Hart (), by far the most well known IG, who served until his death in 1911. Hart oversaw the development of the Service and its activities to its fullest form. Among his many contributions were the establishment of the \"Tongwen Guan\" or School of Combined Learning, which produced numerous translations of works on international law, science, world history, and current events; the postal service; and the Northern Navy. Hart established China’s central statistical office in the Maritime Service in Shanghai and the Statistical Secretariat (1873-1950) and following the Boxer Uprising, set up Customs College to provide educated Chinese staff for the Service. Hart was succeeded by Sir Francis Aglen (1869–1932) () and then by his own nephew, Sir Frederick Maze (1871–1959) (), who served from 1929-1943. In January 1950 the last foreign Inspector-General, American Lester Knox Little (), resigned and the responsibilities of the Service were divided between what eventually became the Customs General Administration of the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of China Directorate General of Customs on Taiwan. It was the only bureaucratic agency of the Chinese government to operate continuously as an integrated entity from 1854 to 1950.\n\nAmongst the many well-known figures who worked for the Customs in China were Willard Straight, botanist Augustine Henry; Johan Wilhelm Normann Munthe, Norwegian; Samuel Cornell Plant who was the First Senior River Inspector from 1915 and for whom the Plant Memorial was raised in his honour; G.R.G. Worcester (1890-1969), River Inspector from 1914 to 1948, and author of seven published books on the Yangzi River; novelist and journalists Bertram Lenox Simpson (known as Putnam Weale) and J.O.P. Bland; and historian H.B. Morse. Medical Officers attached to the Customs included John Dudgeon, in Peking, James Watson at Newchwang and Patrick Manson at Takow and Amoy. The Hong Kong Chinese businessman and political leader Robert Hotung served as a Customs clerk for two years (1878–1880).\n\nA number of early Sinologists emerged from the Service, including linguist Thomas Francis Wade, Edward Charles Bowra, and Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor.\n\nEven higher level 'indoor staff' could have their difficulties in the nineteenth century, as the buying power of their salaries varied with the price of silver, and the extra year's pay every seven years which Hart had negotiated for them in place of a pension did not always allow for adequate saving for retirement. Family travel costs were at the officer's expense, so not all took punctually their due of foreign leave of two years on half pay after the first seven years, and subsequently every ten years. They were subject to all the usual hazards of life in China from illness and civil disruption and difficulties in providing for the education of their children, which often involved family separations. To some extent this was compensated by the strong esprit de corps. A network of friends was sustained across changes of post by letter-writing, quite frequently the duty of their wives.\n\nSir Robert Hart could be a sympathetic boss, but he insisted on high standards of efficiency and honesty, and, for those aspiring to the highest rank of Commissioner, a thorough knowledge of written and spoken Chinese. His most likely young men spent a year or more in Beijing learning Chinese under his supervision, which also allowed him to evaluate other characteristics that would enable them to act sensibly and rapidly in crisis situations demanding immediate response without referral back to him. The compensations included a short working day, which meant the later afternoon could be spent exercising and socializing, going to the races, playing tennis, taking part in amateur dramatics or musical performances, and later enjoy dinner parties, which might include 'absurd games', or a musical interlude.\n\nRecords of individual senior and junior staff in the Chinese Maritime Customs are preserved in the School of Oriental and African Studies, London (SOAS).

The third and final name change came in 1928, to Catalina.\n\nThe earliest wool knit suits were patterned after a simple one-piece style introduced to the US by Australian swim star Annette Kellerman. In the 1920s, Catalina produced increasingly baring and fashionable swimwear, including the boldly striped Chicken Suit, men's Speed Suit and Ribstitch \"S\" suits. With the rising glitz of the silver screen in the 1930s, Catalina adopted the slogan \"Styled for the Stars of Hollywood\". They added to the prestige by using Hollywood starlets, including Bette Davis, Joan Blondell, and Olivia de Havilland in their marketing campaigns. At the time, the average Catalina swimsuit retailed between five and ten dollars, equivalent to $–$ today (assuming 1935 dollars).\n\nIn the 1960s, Catalina became a sister company to Cole of California, a swimwear manufacturer established in 1925. The duo later joined Authentic Fitness Corporation, a subsidiary of Warnaco Inc, in 1993. The merger created a company of swim, active and fitness brands. The following year, with the rising importance of mass market retailers, the decision was made to offer Catalina to Wal-Mart stores across America.\n\nCatalina had a presence in South America, through license agreements, especially Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, sponsoring the beauty pageants in these countries, with several contestants winning the Miss Universe event. Today the brand is manufactured in Brazil, and distributed in the Mercosur countries by Grupo Aguia.\n\nCatalina was part of the Warnaco Swimwear Group's portfolio of brand names including Speedo, Anne Cole, Nautica and Michael Kors. It was sold in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. \n\nCatalina is predominantly women's swimwear, including a rib suit known as the \"Everybody Tank\", as well as Separates, Athletic, and Maternity lines. In 2007, Catalina landed seventh on a list of top swimwear brands ranked by consumer awareness, as published in \"Women's Wear Daily\"s 4th Annual Book of Lists.\n\nIn December 2007 The Warnaco Group announced it had sold the Catalina business to In Mocean Group.\n\nAs of 2014, Catalina swimwear is only available for purchase through Wal-Mart.\n\n"}

It is approximately east of the City of Calgary.\n\nThe town began as a hamlet for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) lines that were built in the area in 1883. The CPR named the town after one of its benefactors: Claude Bowes-Lyon, the Earl of Strathmore. The Earl's granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth – as consort to King George VI – later passed through the community on the \"Royal Train\" in late May 1939.\n\nA track-laying record was made between Strathmore and Cheadle when the railway was built. In one hour one mile (1.6 km) of steel was laid and – at the end of the ten-hour working day – the rails were laid to Cheadle, for a record. Efforts by the Canadian government to develop western Canada led to increases in Strathmore's population and its importance as a rail supply stop.\n\nIn 1905 the CPR moved the Hamlet of Strathmore north to its current location. The first school opened in 1908.\n\nThe CPR railway tracks are now gone, the land having been subdivided.\n\nIn 2011, the Town of Strathmore celebrated its centennial – and released the book \"100 Years of Memories: Celebrating Strathmore’s Centennial\" through Polished Publishing Group in early 2012.\n\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Strathmore recorded a population of 13,756 living in 5,148 of its 5,358 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 12,305. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.\n\nThe Town of Strathmore's 2015 municipal census counted a population of 13,327, a change of from its 2012 municipal census population of 12,352. At its current population, Strathmore is one of the largest towns in the province and is eligible for city status. According to Alberta's \"Municipal Government Act\", a town is eligible for city status when it reaches 10,000 residents.\n\nIn the 2011 Census, the Town of Strathmore had a population of 12,305 living in 4,577 of its 4,930 total dwellings, a change of 19.7% from its 2006 adjusted population of 10,280. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.\n\nToday, the town is an important agricultural community. Oil and gas exploration is also a growing interest in the area. It is the headquarters of Golden Hills School Division No. 75.\n\nMany residents commute daily from Strathmore to Calgary. In the 21st century, the town has seen a major growth in commercial development, with many franchise restaurants and a few big-box chain stores opening in the community.\n\nStrathmore was the home of the Strathmore Rockies, a team in the WWHL. It is currently home to the Strathmore Wheatland Kings of the Heritage Junior \"B\" league; as well as the UFA Bisons of the AMHL, who have helped produce NHL players Zach Boychuk and Mason Raymond among others.\n\nThe Strathmore Spartans football team has alumni players throughout the CJFL and Canadian University system.\n\nThe Strathmore Venom Junior \"B\" lacrosse team won the provincial title in 2010 for the first time since the team was founded in 2004.\n\nStrathmore was one of the hosts for the 2013 Tour of Alberta Pro Cycling Festival.\n\nEvery year Strathmore holds its Heritage Days celebrations, which include the Strathmore Stampede, Canada's third largest rodeo.\n\nStrathmore is part of the Golden Hills School Division.\n\nStrathmore has three elementary schools (Wheatland, Westmount, and Brentwood), one junior high school (Crowther Memorial Junior High School), one high school (Strathmore High School) and a Catholic School providing Kindergarten through grade 6 (Sacred Heart Academy) as well as a grade 7 to 12 Catholic school (Holy Cross Collegiate).\n\nStrathmore was the home of Covenant Bible College Canada. The CBC-C campus relocated in 1995 from its prior home in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In Covenant Bible College, students took a course in religious studies. It was closed in 2007 due to dropping student enrollment and other fiscal problems.

{"id": "1816093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816093", "title": "Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad", "text": "Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad\n\nThe Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad is a short line railroad that operates in Livingston County and Monroe County in New York, United States. The railroad interchanges with CSX at Genesee Junction in Chili, New York, the Rochester and Southern Railroad (RSR) at Genesee Junction and the RSR's Brooks Avenue Yard in Gates, New York, and with the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum at Industry, New York. Their primary freight consists of food products - grains and corn syrup. In 1997, the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad was selected as Short Line Railroad of the Year by industry trade journal Railway Age. The LAL is also the parent company for both the Bath and Hammondsport Railroad and Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nThe route that is now the Livonia, Avon & Lakeville started in the mid-19th century. Originally, the line from Mortimer to Avon was part of the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad – which had constructed an 18-mile route from downtown Rochester, New York, to Avon, New York, by 1851. Eventually this became part of the Erie Railroad, then part of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1960, when the Erie merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad.\n\nThe Livonia Avon & Lakeville Railroad was born when members of the Livonia community decided to rescue the railroad after news came that the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad was to abandon its spur south from Avon connecting Lakeville and Livonia. In 1964, members of the community, led by Chester A. Haak, began a campaign to purchase the soon to be abandoned line from the Erie-Lackawanna for $13,000.\n\nAfter its incorporation in May 1964, passenger excursions began with the use of GE 45-Tonner #97. This engine was sold a year later, and replaced by GE 44-tonner #10. The next year, after acquiring #17, a 2-8-2 steam locomotive and a former Savannah and Atlanta Railway locomotive, the LA&L used this engine for all passenger excursion operations with the old Erie depot in Livonia as excursion headquarters. Three years later, #17 began to develop mechanical issues, and was replaced with #38, a 2-8-0 steam locomotive. #17 was later sold to a Rochester businessman who sold it scrap. In 1972, the railroad acquired its first ALCO diesel locomotive #20, an ALCO RS-1. Three years after this, in 1975, #38 was stored out of service in need of major boiler repairs.\n\nOn April 1, 1976, six major railroads in the northeast United States became one, Conrail. Conrail was now the interchange railroad in Avon, NY, as opposed to the EL. During the planning of Conrail, the LA&L petitioned the United States Railroad Administration to give them the Avon-Caledonia branch of the EL which would have allowed them to interchange with the Chessie System in Caledonia, as well as Conrail. However, the line was excluded from Conrail and later abandoned. In 1977, growing insurance costs forced the LA&L to discontinue passenger excursions.\n\n1980 saw the LAL purchasing their second ALCO, #72, an Alco S2, followed by the selling of the #10. In 1981, the line to Livonia was abandoned due to a lack of support from the state of New York to repair an aging bridge. After the abandonment, the LA&L built a team track in Lakeville to service its customers. In this year, the LA&L also acquired another ALCO locomotive, this time a C-425, numbered 425. When 1982 rolled around it was decided that a classification yard was needed in Lakeville to handle the growing amount of traffic that the railroad was receiving. Later in 1988, this five track yard was completed. Two years later, an engine shop and office building were built next to the yard.\n\nIn 1995, the LA&L acquired yet another engine, an ALCO C-420 numbered 420. The shop was extended to hold two coupled road engines.\n\nIn 1996, the LAL acquired Conrail's \"Rochester South Cluster\" pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995. Instead of interchanging in Avon, the LAL now operated north to Genesee Junction, where they would interchange with Conrail. The railroad launched a $1.4 million rehabilitation effort.\n\nIn the same year, the LA&L began operation of the former Champagne Railroad, now known as the Bath and Hammondsport Railroad, previously owned and operated by the Steuben County Industrial Development Agency. With this deal, the LA&L inherited the use of the railroad's two remaining ALCO S1 engines, numbers 4 and 5, to service the newly acquired railroad. With this acquisition, the railroad grew to 65 route miles. Also, four ALCO C-424m locomotives were purchased. The LA&L was also named \"Industry of the Year\" by the Livingston County Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn 1997, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway applied to split Conrail, the LA&L filed an application to remove the paper barrier that had kept the railroad from interchanging with the Rochester & Southern at Genesee Junction. With fierce opposition from CSX, the Surface Transportation Board granted the LA&L trackage rights across the Genesee Junction Yard, trackage rights into the R&S and its yard at Brooks Avenue, and haulage rights on the R&S to Silver Springs, New York. This gave the LA&L access to three Class I railroads: CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\n1998 was a busy year for the LAL. A number of infrastructure rehabilitation projects resulted in the line from Lakeville to Genesee Jct becoming a 25MPH railroad – not the 5-10MPH that had been. The B&H also saw improvements on the northern end of the line, including the reactivation of ten miles of previously unused rail between Cohocton and Wayland, NY. New track was also built to serve a new road de-icer processing facility. Also in this year, the LA&L gained a controlling interest in the Ontario Central Railroad. Due to the Conrail split, the ONCT finally received competitive connections to CSX, NS, CP Rail, and NYSW by way of the Finger Lakes Railway.\n\nDuring 1999, the bridge on Pole Bridge Road was upgraded to handle 286,000 pound railroad cars. Avon Yard was also rebuilt into its current configuration. The Lakeville shop was expanded to accommodate three coupled road engines with additional floor space in a separate bay to facilitate locomotive repair. Two of the ALCO C-424m locomotives purchased in 1995 were repaired and reactivated, emerging as numbers 423 and 424.\n\nIn 2001, the LA&L began operations on the former Erie-Lackawanna mainline between Hornell, New York, and Corry, Pennsylvania, as the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad. The railroad initially provided rail service between Olean and Jamestown, New York, but eventually extended to more of the line as out-of-service sections were reactivated. In October of that year, the Cohocton Valley Rail Corp. was renamed as the Bath & Hammondsport Rail Corp. Subsidiary WNYP leased additional trackage from Norfolk Southern in 2005 extending from Meadville, PA to Oil City, PA.\n\nIn 2007, the STB granted an exemption to Finger Lakes Railway allowing them to acquire the Ontario Central from LAL. With the completion of the transaction, ONCT RS-36 418 was permanently transferred from LAL. From May through September, the LAL was busy upgrading the majority of its 30-mile mainline from 105 Lbs jointed rail to 127Lbs welded rail - allowing faster trains with heavier loads. Additionally, in 2007 a new Barilla Pasta plant opened in Avon, which receives grains via rail. According to Barilla's US top executive, Kirk Trofholz, the availability of rail transport was \"a must\" when choosing the location for the plant.\n\nThe WNYP saw massive expansion, with the leasing of NS tracks from Machias, New York, south through Olean, NY, to Driftwood, PA. Along with the trackage, the company purchased or leased eight 6-axle Alcos.\n\nOn May 9, 2015, the LA&L celebrated its 50th Anniversary. Excursion trains were run between Lakeville, New York, and Henrietta, New York, followed by a night photo shoot of the locomotives to commemorate the milestone.\n\nThe Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad has a roster made up of primarily ALCO locomotives. The LA&L rosters an S-2 (#72) built in 1941, an RS-1 (#20) built in 1949, two S-1s (#4 and 5), one C-420 (#420), seven C-424s (#421, 422, 423, 424, 426, 427, 428), four of which are of the C-424m rebuilt variant, one C-425 (#425), four C-430s (#430, 431, 432, 433), one C-630 (#630), one M-630 (#631), and an RS-36 (#418). Several of the locomotives are lettered for LA&L subsidiaries Bath & Hammondsport or Western New York & Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore the road became an all-Alco road, their roster consisted of a Baldwin 2-8-2 (#17), a GE 45 Tonner with side rods (#97), and in later years, one GE 44 Tonner (#10) and one 2-8-0 (#38). Number 17 was scrapped in Lakeville after being sold to a Rochester area business-man. Number 38 survives on the Everett Railroad at Duncansville, PA. Former #97 was later sold to Rochester Gas and Electric, where it was used to switch coal cars at Bee Bee Station. When Bee Bee station closed in the early 1990s, the locomotive was donated to the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum, where it has been restored to operating condition as RGE #1941.\n\nThe LAL has trackage rights at CSX's Genesee Junction Yard, allowing the LAL to interchange with the Rochester and Southern Railroad as well as CSX. LAL ownership begins at the east end of Genesee Junction with the former Conrail non-controlled siding that runs parallel to the West Shore Branch from Genesee Junction Yard to MP 360. There, the line heads south onto what was once Erie-Lackawanna Railroad and Lehigh Valley Railroad trackage. Shortly after crossing Jefferson Road (NY-252), the track splits, with one track, the ex-LV Rochester Branch, heading southeast to a pair of online businesses on Lehigh Station Road (NY-253) before coming to an end, while the other track, ex-EL trackage, continues south/southwest towards Avon and eventually hits the Lakeville terminus, ending just shy of Conesus Lake, at one time a Steam Boat terminal.\n\nIn Avon, there is a short branch to Kraft Foods, which is the only remaining part of the Erie's branch to Mount Morris, New York. In 1994 the LAL reactivated a spur to a grain elevator on Bronson Hill Road. This spur was formerly part of the Livonia Branch of the LAL which had been abandoned in 1981.\n\nThe LAL has a three-track yard in the town of Avon which was expanded in 2008 due to increased traffic to Barilla Pasta's manufacturing plant in Avon which opened in 2007. Lakeville is the site of a five-track class-yard and a four-track engine house as well as ADM and Sweeteners Plus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1816098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816098", "title": "Image of the Fendahl", "text": "Image of the Fendahl\n\nImage of the Fendahl is the third serial of the 15th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 29 October to 19 November 1977.\n\nThe serial is set in an English priory. In the serial, the cultist Max Stael (Scott Fredericks) prepares the transformation of the scientist Thea Ransome (Wanda Ventham) to be possessed by an ancient gestalt alien called a Fendahl.\n\nIn a priory near the village of Fetchborough, four scientists, Adam Colby, Max Stael, Thea Ransome and Dr. Fendelman, are doing tests on a human skull they found in Kenya, apparently twelve million years old. When Dr. Fendelman starts using a sonic time scan, trying to get an image of the owner of the skull, the skull itself seems to react, locking onto Thea and releasing something in the priory grounds that kills a passing hiker, who eventually totally disintegrates.\n\nThe scan catches the attention of the Fourth Doctor and Leela when they are pulled down to Earth by it. They set off to find it before it creates a continuum implosion and destroys the planet. They separate and Leela finds the cottage of ‘Mother’ Tyler, a local modern-day witch gifted with psychic powers. The Doctor ends up narrowly avoiding death at the hands of the creature created by the skull, which then kills the leader of a detachment of guards Fendelman has brought in after the death of the hiker, sealing everyone into the priory.\n\nMa Tyler then encounters the creature but survives and is saved from going into psychic shock by the Doctor, who by this time has worked out that the thing is a Fendahleen, a creature from his planet's mythology, supposedly destroyed when the Fifth Planet broke up. He makes his way into the priory and finds the skull, which tries to kill him. Leela saves him and they go off to the Fifth Planet, only to find that the Time Lords sealed the planet in a Time Loop, making all proper records invisible even to them.\n\nThea, meanwhile, has been gradually converted into the new core of the Fendahl, a creature that feeds off life energy and leaves nothing behind. Stael, leader of the local black magic cult, recognises this and believes he can control the Fendahl and use it to dominate. He and his followers capture Colby, kill Fendelman, who was actually influenced through his genetics by the Fendahl to bring this about, and set up the Sonic Time scanner to power the skull and Thea's final transformation.\n\nThe Doctor, Leela, Ma Tyler and her grandson Jack head for the priory only to find the Fendahl core has formed and is converting the cult members into Fendahleen, to form the full circle. The Doctor frees Colby and helps Stael shoot himself after killing one of the new Fendahleen, in turn finding out that they are fatally allergic to salt, leaving the Fendahl core two short of the twelve it needs to be complete and form a gestalt. The Doctor rigs the scanner to implode upon itself and grabs the now dormant skull, leaving with the others only just before the priory is destroyed, along with the Fendahl core and the remaining Fendahleen. The Doctor and Leela then leave and plan to dump the skull near a supernova, thus ending the Fendahl race forever.\n\nWriter Chris Boucher was commissioned to write the story (his third for the series) on 2 May 1977. He delivered the first episode just two days later, the final one being submitted on the 17 June. Boucher had drawn on the 1967 film (rather than the 1958 TV original) \"Quatermass and the Pit\" and the 1959 Kurt Vonnegut novel \"The Sirens of Titan\" including the discovering of an alien skull linked to occult symbols, alien influence of mankind's evolution and the dormant alien influence being brought to bear in contemporary humanity. He also took inspiration from the work of archaeologist Louis Leakey who had been excavating human remains for many years until his death in 1972. Boucher named Colby's dog Leakey as a tribute to him, although later realised that people would miss the reference and assume the name came because \"he pissed all over everything!\" Terrance Dicks' subsequent novelisation of the serial in fact gives both reasons for the name. At the initial read through Tom Baker made numerous jokes about the script, picking out all the double entendres and sending it up. This caused Boucher great upset at the time, but had the knock-on effect of him combing through his scripts from thereon for any signs of double entendres. Boucher never wrote for the series again, immediately after this becoming script editor on \"Blake's 7\" for four years.\n\nProducer Graham Williams had worked with director George Spenton-Foster previously on \"Z-Cars\" and chose him to direct this serial due to his experience with night filming. Spenton-Foster would direct one more time for the series in the following year's \"The Ribos Operation\". Script editor on the serial was Robert Holmes in his final assignment. During the work he was trailed by incoming editor Anthony Read, who would subsequently take up the role solely for the next story in production order \"Underworld\" (the following transmitted story \"The Sun Makers\" having been recorded before \"Image of the Fendahl\"). Read had been a television producer but was asked by head of Serials Graeme McDonald to be script editor to which Read refused until he learned it was for \"Doctor Who\". McDonald had read through the scripts for \"Fendahl\" and objected to a scene in part four which showed Stael raise a gun to his mouth. This was changed at the order of producer Williams and the gunshot is only heard. Following this serial, the horror elements under Holmes' guidance were considerably toned down at the order of McDonald.\n\nThe exterior scenes were shot on the Stargroves estate in Hampshire, which was owned by Mick Jagger. The same location had been used during the filming of \"Pyramids of Mars\". Filming began on Monday 1 August 1977 and continued until the following Thursday. This included two night shoots for the serial on the Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. The first night's filming was disrupted when the generator caught fire. Another generator had to be ordered from London and arrived at 4am. Filming at the estate had only been agreed on the 26 July – less than a week before filming began, with the instruction (as had been the case with \"Pyramids of Mars\") that no effects or explosions were to be undertaken given that the property was a Grade II listed building. Two days after filming was completed Tom Baker and Louise Jameson attended the world's first ever \"Doctor Who\" convention in London. Following rehearsals, studio recording for the serial began on Saturday 20 August and was completed on 6 September 1977.\n\nWanda Ventham, playing Thea, had previously appeared in \"The Faceless Ones\", and would subsequently appear in \"Time and the Rani\", her three appearances were each ten years apart: 1967, 1977 and 1987. Ventham had in fact auditioned for the James Bond film \"Goldfinger\", but lost out to Shirley Eaton and therefore was excited to be painted gold in this serial, as would have been the case in \"Goldfinger\". She also had to wear a dark wig as the human Thea, as Spenton-Foster thought that her natural blonde hair would lose credibility as a scientist. Denis Lill, cast as Fendleman was the production team's second choice after actor Anthony Bate became unavailable. Lill would subsequently appear in \"The Awakening\" and was Ventham's husband in the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\". Scott Fredericks had played Boaz in \"Day of the Daleks\" and was later cast by Spenton-Foster in the \"Blake's 7\" episode \"Weapon\" alongside Graham Simpson who also appears in this story. Derek Martin had appeared a number of times in \"Doctor Who\" as an extra, going back to 1965 and subsequently as a stuntman with the HAVOC group, who had taken part in a number of early serials featuring Jon Pertwee as the Doctor. This was his first and only work on the series as an actor. Series regular Louise Jameson as Leela, regards this as one of her best stories due to it being written by Chris Boucher who had created the character. It was however during the making of this serial that she decided to leave at the end of the series.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995) that \"Image of the Fendahl\" was \"one of the best stabs at outright horror in Doctor Who's history\" that was \"possibly one episode too long ... but the verve of the production more than makes up for this.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker felt that the scripts were \"vague\" and the Fendahl was \"something of a disappointment\", but they praised the supporting characters. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" described the story as \"indeed a 'good one', if not quite great, and a highlight of a dodgy season.\" He praised Baker but noted that Leela was \"toned down\". DVD Talk's John Sinnot gave \"Image of the Fendahl\" three and a half out of five stars, praising the atmosphere but noting that the slow start and \"rather convoluted story\" held it back from being a classic.\n\nThe second episode of this serial attained a 75% score on the Audience Appreciation Index, a record high up to this point.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in May 1979. The book's cover (painted by John Geary) was once voted as the worst in the series by readers of DWB magazine.\n\nThis story was released on VHS in March 1993 and on DVD on 20 April 2009 (1 September 2009 in North America). This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 70 on 7 September 2011.\n\nA book length study of the serial, written by Simon Bucher-Jones, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2016.\n\nThe serial was covered in volume 27 of the book series, which reprinted Andrew Pixley's \"Archive\" features from \"Doctor Who Magazine\" and the various \"Doctor Who Magazine Special Editions\", as well as new articles created specifically for the book.\n\n"}

OSMTH is often referred to simply as the Knights Templars but asserts no direct lineage to the original Order. OSMTH does not officially recognize the claims laid out in the Larmenius Charter as historically valid, but makes a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar. OSMTH, which is open to Christians of any denomination, operates as a charity.\n\nThe \"l'Ordre du Temple\", founded in France in 1705, claimed to be the continuation of the medieval Knights Templar, using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805; \n\nIn 1970, a schism occurred within the OSMTH when General Antoine Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master of the OSMTH at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970. Zdrojewski became the head of one faction of the Order, which he referred to by the French translation: \"Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem\" (OSMTJ), until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994. George Lamirand was succeeded by Nicolas Haimovici Hastier as OSMTJ International Leader.\n\nIn 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Grand Master Fernando de Sousa Fontes from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Fontes forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH.\n\nWhile OSMTH rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical Knights Templar, according to its website and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea, there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.\n\nIn 2001, the Order was accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organisation, in special consultative status, one of over 2,000 organizations to hold this status. The Order is an associate member of the International Peace Bureau and an affiliate of the International Center for Religion & Diplomacy, which was founded by one of OSMTH's members. In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.\n\nThe order exists in each country under different jurisdictions. The United States Grand Priory of the OSMTH is known as the \"Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, Inc.\" (SMOTJ) - this being the English rendering of the Latin name. They should not be confused with a multitude of other self-styled \"Knights Templar\", or the Masonic Knights Templar.\n\nOSMTH is registered in Geneva, Swiss Reg No: CH-660.1.972777-4 and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has over 5000 active members in Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, England & Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Serbia, Ukraine and in the United States. OSMTH operates in a number of countries providing humanitarian aid such as the River Jordan Project that is supported by HM King Abdullah of Jordan.\n\nThe ecumenical Christian organization operates as a modern-day network of educated professionals. As of August 2007, the organization had approximately 5,200 members.\n\nChristian men who join the organisation are self-styled as \"Knights\" with the title of \"Chevalier\" and females are termed \"Dames\" with the title of \"Chevaleresse\" (or \"Chevalière\"). The modern Order claims over 5000 members, allegedly including leaders in the military, business, government and ecclesiastical communities.\n\nThe Order's Royal Patron, who is also a Chevalière of the Order, is Her Highness Princess Elisabeth of Ysenburg and Büdingen (b. 1945), the eldest daughter of the late Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his wife, Duchess Anastasia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The House of Schleswig-Holstein is unique by virtue of its numerous junior lines that have occupied (and will be occupying) thrones beside that of the senior, ducal line, to which Princess Elisabeth belongs. Through her father she is a direct descendant of King Frederick V of Denmark and King George II of Great Britain. Princess Elisabeth is the widow of Prince Ferdinand Heinrich of Ysenburg and Büdingen (1940-1989), and has two sons, Prince Johann Georg and Prince Ludwig.\n\nThe Religious Patron is H.E. Archbishop Dr. Vicken Aykazain, Legate of the Eastern Diocese Armenian, Orthodox Church of America.\n\nThe OSMTJ split from OSMTH in 1970 after the former Grandmaster Fontes refused to obey the laws of succession when General Antoine Zdrojewski was elected. Some of the Grand Priories, including the French, Belgian, Swiss, and Polish, followed the newly elected General Zdrojewski, and some stayed loyal to Fontes.  Alfred Zappelli (Grand Prior of Switzerland), General Georges de Bruyn (Grand Prior of Belgium), and Badouraly-Somji Alibay (Commander of the Polish Commandery)  were also backers of General Zdrojewski.  After the election of Zdrojewski, those who followed him became known as OSMTJ.  Those who continued to follow de Sousa Fontes were known as OSMTH (or “OSMTH-Regency”).  “OSMTJ” is the French acronym  for  “Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem.” \n\nIn late 1973, Grand Master Zdrojewski carried out a re-organization of the OSMTJ and a reform of the Statutes. He approved the Grand Priories re-asserting the independence of the International Federation of Autonomous Grand Priories of the OSMTJ (Each member Grand Priory was recognized as autonomous). The Swiss Grand Priory accepted these reformed statutes in 1973, while the Belgian and United States Grand Priories accepted them in 1975. Zdrojewski was succeeded by as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994. George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier as Regent.\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ), founded in 1962, is the American autonomous Grand Priory of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH). branch of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani. The SMOTJ broke with the OSMTH-Regency in 1995 when it refused to recognize the sovereignty of OSMTH-Regency Grand Master Dom Fernando de Sousa Fontes.\n\nThis name Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) has been trademarked and is used exclusively in America by the SMOTJ and thus does not refer to the group of organizations tracing lineage to OSMTH but rather to the current OSMTH only.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1816102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816102", "title": "Fitz John Porter", "text": "Fitz John Porter\n\nFitz John Porter (August 31, 1822 – May 21, 1901) (sometimes written FitzJohn Porter or Fitz-John Porter) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general during the American Civil War. He is most known for his performance at the Second Battle of Bull Run and his subsequent court martial.\n\nAlthough Porter served well in the early battles of the Civil War, his military career was ruined by the controversial trial, which was called by his political rivals. After the war, he worked for almost 25 years to restore his tarnished reputation and was finally restored to the army's roll.\n\nPorter was born on August 31, 1822 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the son of Captain John Porter and Eliza Chauncy Clark. He came from a family prominent in American naval service; his cousins were William D. Porter, David Dixon Porter, and David G. Farragut. Porter's father was an alcoholic who had been reassigned to land duty. Porter's childhood was chaotic because of his father's illness. The younger Porter pursued an army career. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, then from the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 1845, standing eighth out of 41 cadets, and was brevetted a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery.\n\nPorter was promoted to second lieutenant on June 18, 1846 and First Lieutenant on May 29, 1847. He served in the Mexican–American War and was appointed a brevet captain on September 8, 1847, for bravery at the Battle of Molino del Rey. He was wounded at Chapultepec on September 13, for which he also received a brevet promotion to major. He was an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847, a military society composed of officers who served during the Mexican War.\n\nAfter the war with Mexico ended, Porter returned to West Point and became a cavalry and artillery instructor from 1849 to 1853. He served as adjutant to the academy's superintendent until 1855. He next was posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, as assistant adjutant general in the Department of the West in 1856; he was brevetted to captain at Fort Leavenworth that June. Porter served under future Confederate Albert Sidney Johnston in the expedition against the Mormons in 1857 and 1858. Afterward, Porter inspected and reorganized the defenses of Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, until late 1860, when he aided the evacuation of military personnel from Texas after that state seceded from the Union.\n\nAfter the start of the Civil War, Porter became chief of staff and assistant adjutant general for the Department of Pennsylvania, but he was soon promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry on May 14, 1861. General John A. Logan, Porter's later political nemesis, would accuse Porter of helping persuade his commander Robert Patterson to let Joseph E. Johnston's force escape out of the Shenandoah Valley and reinforce P. G. T. Beauregard, thus turning the tide at the First Battle of Bull Run. In August, Porter was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers, backdated to May 17 so he would be senior enough to receive divisional command in the Army of the Potomac, newly formed under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. Soon Porter became a trusted adviser and loyal friend to McClellan, but his association with the soon-to-be-controversial commanding general would prove to be disastrous for Porter's military career.\n\nPorter led his division at the beginning of the Peninsula Campaign, seeing action at the Siege of Yorktown. McClellan created two provisional corps and Porter was assigned to command the V Corps. During the Seven Days Battles, and particularly at the Battle of Gaines' Mill, he displayed a talent for defensive fighting. At the Battle of Malvern Hill, Porter also played a leading role. For his successful performance on the peninsula, he was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 4, 1862.\n\nPorter's corps was sent to reinforce Maj. Gen. John Pope in the Northern Virginia Campaign, a reassignment that he openly challenged and complained about, criticizing Pope personally. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, on August 29, 1862, he was ordered to attack the flank and rear of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's wing of the Army of Northern Virginia. Porter had stopped at Dawkin's Branch, where he had encountered Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry screen. On August 29 he received a message from Pope directing him to attack the Confederate right (which Pope assumed to be Jackson on Stony Ridge), but at the same time to maintain contact with the neighboring division under Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, a conflict in orders that could not be resolved. Pope was apparently unaware that Confederate Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's wing of the army had arrived on the battlefield; the proposed envelopment of Jackson's position would have collided suicidally with Longstreet's large force. Porter chose not to make the attack because of the intelligence he had received that Longstreet was to his immediate front.\nOn August 30 Pope again ordered the flank attack, and Porter reluctantly complied. As the V Corps turned to head towards Jackson's right and attacked, it presented its own (and consequently the entire army's) flank to Longstreet's waiting men. About 30,000 Confederates assailed Porter's 5,000 or so men, driving through them and into the rest of Pope's forces, doing exactly what Porter most feared would come of these orders. Pope was infuriated by the defeat, accused Porter of insubordination, and relieved him of his command on September 5.\n\nPorter was soon restored to command of the corps by McClellan and led it through the Maryland Campaign, where the corps served in a reserve position during the Battle of Antietam. He is said to have told McClellan, \"Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.\" McClellan took his implied advice and failed to commit his reserves into a battle that might have been won if he had used his forces aggressively.\n\nOn November 25, 1862, Porter was arrested and court-martialed for his actions at Second Bull Run. By this time, McClellan had been relieved by President Abraham Lincoln and could not provide political cover for his protégé. Porter's association with the disgraced McClellan and his open criticism of Pope were significant reasons for his conviction at court-martial. Porter was found guilty on January 10, 1863, of disobedience and misconduct, and he was dismissed from the Army on January 21, 1863. \n\nIn describing the Battle of Second Manassas, Edward Porter Alexander wrote that Confederates who knew Porter respected him greatly and considered his dismissal \"one of the best fruits of their victory\".\n\nAfter the war ended, Porter was offered a command in the Egyptian Army but declined it. He spent most of the remainder of his public life fighting against the perceived injustice of his court-martial.\n\nIn 1878, a special commission under General John Schofield exonerated Porter by finding that his reluctance to attack Longstreet probably saved Pope's Army of Virginia from an even greater defeat. Eight years later, President Grover Cleveland commuted Porter's sentence and a special act of the U.S. Congress restored Porter's commission as an infantry colonel in the U.S. Army, backdated to May 14, 1861, but without any back pay due. Two days later, August 7, 1886, Porter, seeing vindication, voluntarily retired from the Army.\n\nPorter was involved in mining, construction, and commerce. He was appointed as the New York City Commissioner of Public Works, the New York City Police Commissioner, and the New York City Fire Commissioner. He died in Morristown, New Jersey, and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York. His grave can be found in Section 54, Lot 5685/89.\n\nOn December 27, 1894, Porter, along with 18 others, founded the Military and Naval Order of the United States, which was soon renamed the Military Order of Foreign Wars. Porter's name was at the top of the list of signers of the original institution and received the first insignia issued by the Order.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1816110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816110", "title": "Joseph Engelberger", "text": "Joseph Engelberger\n\nJoseph Frederick Engelberger was born on July 27, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Connecticut during the Great Depression, but later returned to New York City for his college education.\n\nEngelberger received his B.S. in physics in 1946, and M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1949 from Columbia University. He worked as an engineer with Manning, Maxwell and Moore, where he met inventor George Devol at a Westport cocktail party in 1956, two years after Devol had designed and patented a rudimentary industrial robotic arm. However, Manning, Maxwell and Moore was sold and Engelberger's division was closed that year.\n\nFinding himself jobless but with a business partner and an idea, Engelberger co-founded Unimation with Devol, creating the world's first robotics company. In 1957, he also founded Consolidated Controls Corporation. As president of Unimation, Engelberger collaborated with Devol to engineer and produce an industrial robot under the brand name Unimate. The first Unimate robotic arm was installed at a General Motors Plant in Ewing Township, New Jersey, in 1961.\n\nThe introduction of robotics to the manufacturing process effectively transformed the automotive industry, with Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company soon following General Motors' lead and installing Unimates in their manufacturing facilities. The rapid adoption of the technology also provided Unimation with a working business model: after selling the first Unimate at a $35,000 loss, as demand increased, the company was able to begin building the robotic arms for significantly less and thus began to turn a substantial profit. Over the next two decades, the Japanese took the lead by investing heavily in robots to replace people performing certain tasks. In Japan, Engelberger was widely hailed as a key player in the postwar ascendancy of Japanese manufacturing quality and efficiency.\n\nIn 1966, Engelberger and a Unimate robot appeared on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". In the segment, the robot poured a beer, sank a golf putt, and directed the band.\n\nAn early proponent of increased investment in robotic systems, Engelberger published articles and gave congressional testimony on the value of using automation in space long before the successes of NASA's Mars landers, \"Galileo\", and other unmanned space science missions. He also consulted for NASA on the use of robotics in space exploration.\n\nUnimation purchased Victor Scheinman's Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language. However, the automotive companies that had been Unimation's earliest and most reliable clients began moving away from the use of hydraulically powered robotic arms in the early 1980s in favor of electric motors, a change that Engelberger vehemently opposed. Sales fell, and the company was acquired by Westinghouse in 1982 for $107 million. Engelberger, who had served as Unimation's chief executive since its inception, left the company not long thereafter.\n\nAfter observing the help for his aging parents, Engelberger saw the robotics automations could be used in the medical field. In 1984, Engelberger founded Transitions Research Corporation. He introduced the HelpMate, a mobile robot hospital courier, as the flagship product of his new company. He hoped to kick-start a new industry for in-home robots, but he started in 1988 by selling his first HelpMate to Danbury Hospital, located in the same Connecticut city where his company was based. The medical robot was successful enough that the hospital ended up purchasing another, and within a decade, well over 100 hospitals worldwide operated HelpMates, whether purchased outright or rented from Engelberger's company, which he renamed HelpMate Robotics Inc.\n\nAfter Engelberger was awarded the Japan Prize in 1997, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut delivered a floor speech in the U.S. Senate in praise and recognition of the inventor, calling HelpMate Robotics \"an example of the way that a patient federal investment in science and technology can lead to new products that employ Americans and make for a better quality of life.\"\n\nHelpMate was acquired by Cardinal Health in the late 1990s, a move Engelberger came to regret, complaining that the new owners moved away from his preferred model of renting out robots toward selling off used, depreciated models.\n\nThe 2000 World Automation Congress was dedicated to Engelberger, who delivered the keynote address. Even after his departure from HelpMate and well into his 80s, he remained active in the promotion and development of robots for use in elder care. He notably discouraged the notion of legged robots, arguing that robots should use wheels for locomotion, although he supported the use of robotic arms to allow the machines to interact with their surroundings. He worked on developing a two-armed robot to act as a \"servant-companion\" to seniors with limited mobility.\n\nEngelberger died on December 1, 2015, in Newtown, Connecticut, a little more than four months after celebrating his 90th birthday.\n\nEngelberger published \"Robotics in Practice\" in 1980. The book became a classic in the field and has been translated into six languages. \"Robotics in Practice\" was followed by \"Robotics in Service\" in 1989.\n\nEngelberger was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1984. He was also honored among \"The 1000 Makers of the 20st Century\" by \"The Sunday Times\" in 1992. Additional honors include the Progress Award of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the 1982 Nyselius Award from the American Die Casting Institution, the 1982 Leonardo da Vinci Award of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the 1982 American Machinist Award, the 1983 Golden Omega Award at the Electrical Electronics Insulation Conference, the 1983 McKechnie Award from the University of Liverpool, the 1984 Egleston Medal from Columbia University, the 1997 Beckman Award for pioneering and original research in the field of automation, and the 1997 Japan Prize, the highest Japanese technology honor, for the establishment of the robot industry. He also received the IEEE Robotics and Automation Award in 2004.\n\nThe Robotics Industries Association annually presents the Joseph F. Engelberger Awards to \"persons who have contributed outstandingly to the furtherance of the science and practice of robotics.\" The award was first given in 1977.\n\nEngelberger's most famous co-invention, the Unimate industrial robotic arm, was among the first inductees into the Robot Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\n"}

West Coast rappers Tone Loc and Young MC visited the video shoot and participated in the event.\n\n\nAfter a young fan was killed at a 1988 Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy show, KRS-One formed the Stop the Violence Movement in hopes of encouraging the hip hop community to end violence being committed among themselves. Further inspired by the recent murder of fellow BDP founding member Scott La Rock, he assembled many contemporary East Coast hip hop rap stars of the time to record a song about anti-violence. With production assistance by bandmate D-Nice and Hank Shocklee of the Bomb Squad, the product of the session was the chart-topping song \"Self Destruction.\" All proceeds went to the National Urban League.

{"id": "1816123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816123", "title": "Dusky seaside sparrow", "text": "Dusky seaside sparrow\n\nThe dusky seaside sparrow (\"Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens\") was a non-migratory subspecies of the seaside sparrow, found in Florida in the natural salt marshes of Merritt Island and along the St. Johns River. The last definite known individual died on June 17, 1987, and the subspecies was officially declared extinct in December 1990.\n\nThe dusky seaside sparrow was first categorized as a species in 1873, after its discovery on March 17, 1872, by Charles Johnson Maynard. Its dark coloration and distinct song are what separates it as a subspecies of other seaside sparrows. Found in the marshes of Florida's Atlantic Coast on Merrit Island and the upper St. Johns River, the dusky seaside sparrow was geographically isolated from other seaside sparrows (Hill 239). It was categorized as a subspecies in 1973. Even though the dusky's mitochondrial DNA is the same as the mitochondrial DNA of other seaside sparrow populations, DNA testing by itself does not demonstrate that its subspecies classification is undeserving (Hill 239). In 1981, only five dusky seaside sparrows remained, all being males. Conservation efforts were made by trying to breed the remaining duskies with Scott's seaside sparrows in order to create half dusky hybrid offspring. \"Unfortunately, although the Fish and Wildlife Service initially supported the crossbreeding program, it withdrew its support due to Interior's hybrid policy\" (Hill 239). Due to only the males being left, even though duskies could be crossbred with other seaside sparrows, there would never be another pure dusky seaside sparrow again.\n\nBased on comparisons between mtDNA of the dusky seaside sparrow and its close relative, Scott's seaside sparrow, John Avise and William Nelson were able to estimate the last time that the dusky sparrow and the seaside sparrow came in contact. Since it has been established that the dusky sparrow had a very small inhabited locale, it was isolated from other sparrows for a very long time. Assuming that the mtDNA in sparrows evolves at the rate which is estimated for mammals and other birds (approximately 2–4% every million years), then the last time the dusky sparrow was in contact with Scott's seaside sparrow was approximately 250,000–500,000 years ago, giving plenty of time for the dusky sparrow to establish differences between other varieties of species, such as its unique plumage and call.\n\nWhen Merritt Island was flooded with the goal of reducing the mosquito population around the Kennedy Space Center, the sparrows' nesting grounds were devastated, and their numbers plummeted. Later, the marshes surrounding the river were drained to facilitate highway construction along with the sugar and oil industries; this was a further blow. Eventually, pollution and pesticides took such a high toll that by 1979, only six dusky seaside sparrows were known to exist — all of whom were males; a female was last sighted in 1975.\n\nCaptive breeding of all remaining dusky seaside sparrows with the Scott's seaside sparrow (\"A. m. peninsulae\") from Florida's gulf coast was approved in 1979. By 1980 five dusky seaside sparrows were in a captive breeding facility in Gainesville, Florida. One, banded in 1978 with an orange leg band, was unique.\n\n\"Orange Band\" was left by himself on the St. Johns Unit of the St. Johns NWR after a yellow-leg-banded dusky was captured in 1979. Field observations of color banded sparrows from 1975 to 1979 indicated that dusky seaside sparrows seldom traveled more than a mile or two in their lifetimes. In April 1980, \"Orange Band\" was again observed on the St. Johns Unit, but was surprisingly captured in June eight miles south on the Beeline Unit in the company of a dusky with a green leg band. Before finding \"Green Band\", \"Orange Band\" passed the general vicinity of the two unbanded dusky seaside sparrows.\n\nIn 1983 the last four living dusky seaside sparrows were taken to the Walt Disney World Resort, to continue crossbreeding and living out their days in a protected habitat on the Discovery Island nature reserve. By March 31, 1986, only \"Orange Band\" remained.\n\nDespite being blind in one eye, \"Orange Band\" reached extreme old age for a sparrow, living at least nine years, and possibly as many as thirteen, before dying on June 17, 1987.\n\nAfter the death of the final \"pure\" dusky sparrow, the breeding program was discontinued due to the fact that it was thought the hybrids that exist could not reproduce to create dusky sparrows, since they did not share the proper mtDNA that dusky sparrows possess. However, research done on a similar species known as \"Passerella iliaca\", or the fox sparrow, was able to show that some subspecies of one plumage group had the plumage of another despite having the \"wrong\" mtDNA type. This potentially meant that if the breeding program was continued with the dusky sparrow hybrids, sparrows with the same color plumage as the dusky sparrows would eventually be produced. Unfortunately, shortly after the breeding program was halted, the remaining hybrid sparrows either died or escaped captivity, leading to the final extinction of the taxon.\n\n\"Green Band\" proved elusive, and was never recaptured after having been banded. He was last seen on July 23, 1980.\n\n\n"}

Williams\n\nAlpheus Starkey Williams (September 29, 1810 – December 21, 1878) was a lawyer, judge, journalist, U.S. Congressman, and a Union general in the American Civil War.\n\nWilliams was born in Deep River, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale University with a law degree in 1831. His father, who died when Williams was eight years old, had left him a sizable inheritance, which he used between 1832 and 1836 for extensive travel in the United States and Europe. Upon his return, he settled in Detroit, Michigan, which was a booming frontier town in 1836. He established himself as a lawyer and married the daughter of a prominent family, Jane Hereford Larned, with whom he produced five children, two of whom died as infants. Jane herself died young as well, in 1848, at the age of 30.\n\nWilliams had a variety of careers in Detroit. He was elected probate judge of Wayne County, Michigan; in 1842, president of the Bank of St. Clair; in 1843, the owner and editor of the Detroit \"Advertiser\" daily newspaper; from 1849 to 1853, postmaster of Detroit.\n\nWhen Williams arrived in Detroit in 1836, he joined a company in the Michigan Militia and maintained a connection to the military activities of the city for years. In 1847, he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 1st Michigan Infantry destined for the Mexican–American War, but it arrived too late to see any action. He also served as the president of the state's military board and in 1859 was a major in the Detroit Light Guard.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Williams was involved in training the first army volunteers in the state. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on May 17, 1861. His first assignment after leaving the training camps was as a brigade commander in Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks's division of the Army of the Potomac, from October 1861 to March 1862. He then assumed division command in the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, as of March 13, 1862. This division was transferred to the Department of the Shenandoah from April to June of that year. Williams and Banks were sent to fight Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley and were thoroughly outmaneuvered, allowing Jackson to bottle them up in the Valley with his much smaller force.\n\nOn June 26, Williams division was transferred to the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, for the Northern Virginia Campaign. In the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Banks's Corps was again up against Jackson, and was again defeated. Williams' division did not reach the Second Battle of Bull Run until after the battle was over.\n\nWilliams' division rejoined the Army of the Potomac as the 1st Division of the XII Corps and marched north in the Maryland Campaign to the Battle of Antietam. On the way, troops from the division found the famous Confederate \"lost dispatch,\" Special Order 191, that revealed Gen. Robert E. Lee's plan for the campaign and gave Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan key insights on how to defeat Lee's divided army. The division was heavily engaged at Sharpsburg, once again up against Jackson on the Confederate left flank. The corps commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield, was killed early at Antietam, and Williams assumed temporary command. The corps suffered 25% casualties in assaulting Jackson, and Brig. Gen. George S. Greene's division was forced to withdraw from its advanced position at the Dunker Church. Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum replaced Williams as permanent corps commander immediately after the battle.\n\nWilliams' division missed the next major battle for the Army of the Potomac, the Battle of Fredericksburg, because it was engaged in defending the Potomac River in the Reserve. In the Battle of Chancellorsville, on May 2, 1863, Stonewall Jackson's corps executed a surprise flanking movement and smashed into the right flank of the Army of the Potomac, severely damaging the unsuspecting XI Corps. The neighboring division, under Williams, entrenched hastily and was able to stop the Confederate advance before it overran the entire army, but it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process.\n\nIn the Battle of Gettysburg, Williams' division arrived on the battlefield late in the afternoon of July 1, 1863, and occupied Benner's Hill, east of the town of Gettysburg. On July 2, the XII Corps took up positions on Culp's Hill, the right flank of the Union line. At this point, due to a command misunderstanding, Henry Slocum believed that he was in command of the \"Right Wing\" of the army, consisting of the XI and XII Corps. Therefore, Williams assumed temporary command of the XII Corps and controlled it for the rest of the battle. Brig. Gen. Thomas Ruger took command of Williams' division.\n\nOn the afternoon of July 2, a massive attack by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet on the Union's left flank caused army commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade to order Williams to transfer his entire corps to reinforce the left, in the vicinity of Little Round Top. Williams convinced Meade of the importance of Culp's Hill and managed to retain one brigade, under Greene, in their defensive positions. In an heroic defense, Greene and his brigade withstood the assault of Maj. Gen. Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson's Confederate division (the \"Stonewall Division\") throughout the night, until the remaining brigades of the XII Corps returned. Early on July 3, Williams launched an attack against the Confederates who had occupied some of the entrenchments on the hill and, after a seven-hour battle, regained his original line. Unfortunately for Williams, General Slocum was late in writing his official report of the battle, and Meade submitted his report for the army without acknowledging the critical contributions that Williams and XII Corps made to the Union defense.\n\nIn September 1863, the Union army in Tennessee was defeated at the Battle of Chickamauga and two corps were sent west to help them as they were besieged in Chattanooga—the XI and XII Corps. (They later were combined due to their small sizes into a new XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland.) Williams' division did not reach Chattanooga, but guarded railroads in eastern Tennessee. However, it did join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman as part of XX Corps in the Atlanta Campaign and fought with distinction in a number of battles, particularly the Battle of Resaca. Williams was wounded in the arm at the Battle of New Hope Church on May 26, 1864. His division followed Sherman through his March to the Sea and the Carolinas Campaign. In these campaigns Williams lead XX Corps until, following the Battle of Bentonville, Joseph A. Mower was given command. Williams resumed leading his division. During this period, Williams received a brevet promotion to Major General on January 12, 1865.\n\nThroughout much of the war, Williams had two horses — Yorkshire and Plug Ugly. Yorkshire being more showy, Williams often preferred the larger Plug Ugly for more grueling duty. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, a Confederate shell landed in the thick mud underneath Plug Ugly, the subsequent explosion of which sent both horse and rider into the air. Remarkably, Williams was uninjured, and, perhaps most remarkably, the horse escaped with a few minor injuries. Plug Ugly eventually became too worn for further use, and in 1864 Williams sold him for $50. Williams learned that the horse died not long after the sale.\n\nAfter the war, Williams served as a military administrator in southern Arkansas until he left the service on January 15, 1866. He returned to Michigan, but faced financial difficulties that forced him to take a post as the U.S. Minister at San Salvador, a position in which he served until 1869. He ran for governor of Michigan in 1870, but was not elected.\n\nWilliams was elected as a Democrat to the 45th United States Congress from Michigan's 1st congressional district, serving from March 4, 1875, to December 21, 1878. For part of his time in congress he served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia.\n\nWilliams suffered a stroke on December 21, 1878, and died in the U.S. Capitol Building. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.\n\nWilliams was a general who never received much public recognition. Despite fighting in important commands, he remained a brigadier general throughout most of the war. There were three reasons likely for the situation: first, he was not a West Point graduate, and the \"old boys network\" was as effective in the 19th century as it is today; second, during the formative months of the Army of the Potomac, Williams was stationed in the Shenandoah Valley, which denied him familiarity to the high command when reputations were being established; third, Williams was never comfortable mastering the common practice of promoting himself to the public with the help of friendly newspaper correspondents. Williams did, however, communicate well with his family, and the letters he wrote throughout the war were saved and published posthumously in 1959 as the well-regarded book, \"From the Cannon's Mouth: The Civil War Letters of General Alpheus S. Williams\".\n\nAn equestrian memorial to Williams by sculptor Henry Shrady stands in Belle Isle Park, in his home town of Detroit. Williams Avenue in the Gettysburg National Military Park is named for him.\n\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-13\n"}

She notes that a total number of victims is unknown but that the high number often given is nine million deaths, over a period of 300 or more years. Otherwise, scholarly \"high\" estimates range around 100,000, with estimates around 60,000 more common.\nThe nine million figure, according to modern scholarship, originates with a 1784 article by Gottfried Christian Voigt, in which he estimates the figure of 9,442,994 executions between AD 600 and 1700 - a period of 1,100 years - unsupported by any evidence.\n\nAccording to William Donohue and Robert Eady of the Catholic Civil Rights League, the movie is inaccurate in other respects, \"e.g.\", placing Trier in France instead of Germany, and dating a stone cross there that is recorded to have been erected in 958 AD to 1132 AD without further explanation. The cross is shown as a \"symbol of a new religious cult that was sweeping across Europe,\" despite Christian presence since 286. Eady, a member of the League in Canada, has cited the film in a complaint to broadcast regulators, in particular mentioning offense at the movie's quote: \"it took the Church two hundred years of terror and death to transform the image of paganism into devil worship, and folk culture into heresy.\" Eady describes the documentary as propaganda intended to represent the Christian Church as \"a wicked, patriarchal, misogynist institution\".\nJack Kapica adds \"Women have genuine grievances with the Church. \"The Burning Times\", however, is not going to help their cause.\"\n\n"}

Following a short stint in the military, Tian began his artistic career first as an amateur photographer and then as an assistant cinematographer at the Beijing Agricultural Film Studio. In 1978, he was accepted to the Beijing Film Academy, from which he graduated in 1982, together with classmates Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. The class of 1982 collectively would soon gain fame as the so-called Fifth Generation film movement, with Tian Zhuangzhuang as one of the movement's key figures.\n\nTian's early career was marked both with avant-garde documentary infused films (\"On the Hunting Ground\" (1985), \"The Horse Thief\" (1986)) to more commercial fare (\"\" (1991)). In 1991, Tian began work on a quiet epic about one of modern China's darkest moments. This film, \"The Blue Kite\" (1993), would eventually result in Tian's nearly decade long exile from the film industry, an exile he returned from with \"Springtime in a Small Town\" (2001). Throughout the 2000s, Tian Zhuangzhuang returned to the fore of Chinese cinema, directing films like the biopic \"The Go Master\" (2006) and the historical action film \"The Warrior and the Wolf\" (2009). Since his banning after the release of \"The Blue Kite\", Tian has also emerged as a mentor for some of China's newest film talents, and he has helped produce several important films for these new generations of directors.\n\nTian Zhuangzhuang was born on April 23, 1952 in Beijing. He was the son of Tian Fang, a famous actor in the 1930s who became head of the Beijing Film Studio after 1949, and Yu Lan, an actress who later ran the Beijing Children's Film Studio. Given his parents' busy jobs as studio chiefs, Tian was raised primarily by his grandmother, though his parents' positions also allowed him to live a relatively comfortable childhood. But because of the Tians' prominence, Tian Zhuangzhuang suffered heavily during the Cultural Revolution, and both his parents were persecuted. Unlike fellow director Chen Kaige, however, Tian never joined the Red Guards, and was eventually sent to the countryside in Jilin, like many youths from so-called \"bad families.\"\n\nThough from a cinema family, Tian did not initially want to follow in the family footsteps. Instead, Tian enlisted in the People's Liberation Army in 1968 and served for three years. There he met a war photographer, who introduced him to the camera. Working as a photographer for five years, Tian eventually decided to switch to cinematography and found a job as an assistant cinematographer at the Beijing Agricultural Film Studio.\n\nIn 1978, after three years at the studio, Tian applied for entrance in the Beijing Film Academy and was accepted. However, he was forced to apply to the directing department rather than the cinematography department due to his age.\n\nWhile enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy, Tian directed a short student film, \"Our Corner\" (1980), based on a short story by Shi Tiesheng. Technically, \"Our Corner\" stands as the first film made by Fifth Generation directors. Years later, \"Our Corner\" would continue to be screened by professors at the BFA, introducing Tian to new generations of actors and filmmakers. As a result of his role in the making of \"Our Corner\", as well as his experience in film before entering school, Tian became a de facto leader among the students of the BFA. They admired not only his natural talent, but also his natural eye for talent and loyalty to his friends, most notably with Hou Yong, who would go on to serve as his cinematographer in many of Tian's early works.\n\nUpon his graduation in 1982, Tian was assigned to the Beijing Film Studio, though his early career was spent making films for other studios. These included works for television, as well as the children's film \"Red Elephant\" (1982, co-directed with Zhang Jianya and Xie Xiaojing).\n\nTian reached international prominence with a pair of experimental films in the mid-1980s, \"On the Hunting Ground\" (1985) and \"The Horse Thief\" (1986), both about ethnic minorities in China. Though \"On the Hunting Ground\" and \"The Horse Thief\" were warmly received abroad — American director Martin Scorsese named \"The Horse Thief\" as his favorite film of the 1990s (when \"The Horse Thief\" was finally released in the United States) — neither film succeeded domestically, and both were considered commercial flops. \"On the Hunting Ground\", for example, sold a meager four prints. Moreover, both films were criticized by the state and by traditionalists as elitist, and as pandering to foreign audiences, a charge that Tian vigorously and defiantly accepted, arguing that films were for the sophisticated. Nevertheless, stung by the rebukes, Tian followed up \"The Horse Thief\" with a string of commercially viable films, including \"Street Players\" (1987) (his first with the Beijing Film Studio), \"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\" (1988), and the historical costume film \"\" (1991). Tian has since tried to distance himself from these films, often noting that they were part of a journeyman period of his career, where he would sign on to direct existing projects with funding and screenplays already in place.\n\nIn 1998 Tian was honoured with a Prince Claus Award from the Prince Claus Fund, an international culture and development organisation based in Amsterdam.\n\nMany of Tian's earlier works had drawn fire from the Chinese government. For example, television producers refused to screen his short film \"Our Corner\", and his first major film, \"September\" (1984), suffered censor interference with several major scenes left on the cutting room floor. But Tian would not face serious consequences as a result of his work until his masterpiece, \"The Blue Kite\" (1993), a film about the adverse effects of Communist rule from the Hundred Flowers Movement, through the Great Leap Forward, and especially the Cultural Revolution. The film's quiet criticism of Communist policies in the 1950s and 1960s quickly made it a pariah in the Beijing Film Studio, who refused to submit the film for central approval to be sent abroad for post-production. \"The Blue Kite\" reportedly had to be smuggled out of the country by Tian's friends, where it would proceed to screen at foreign film festivals (including the 1993 Cannes Film Festival) without approval. Due to the controversy, Tian resigned from his position in the Beijing Film Studio in March 1994. A month later, he became one of six filmmakers blacklisted by the government in April 1994, along with Sixth Generation helmers Wang Xiaoshuai, He Jianjun, Zhang Yuan, Zhang's wife, screenwriter Ning Dai, and the documentary filmmaker Wu Wenguang.\n\nThe ban would last officially until 1996, though Tian would not make another film for several more years. In the interim, he focused on producing, and helped shepherd some of China's new generation of directors with their projects, including his former art director Huo Jianqi (1995's \"The Winner\") and the Sixth Generation mainstays, Lu Xuechang (1996's \"The Making of Steel\" in which Tian also acted) and Wang Xiaoshuai (1998's \"So Close to Paradise\", a film that would see its own share of controversy). Tian's role as mentor for new filmmakers has continued into the 21st century and has seen Tian taking young talent such as Ma Liwen and Ning Hao under his wing.\n\nAfter a hiatus from directing of some nine years where Tian mainly focused on producing other directors' works, he returned with a critically acclaimed remake of Fei Mu's masterpiece, \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), entitled \"Springtime in a Small Town\". As Tian's first film after his ban for \"The Blue Kite\", \"Springtime\" was a small, intimate chamber piece with only five roles. To some critics, it reflected Tian's attempt to \"play it safe,\" though the film's lack of political message did not dull its critical reception.\n\nIn 2004, Tian returned to his favorite subject of China's ethnic minorities with \"Delamu\", a HD-filmed documentary about peoples in Yunnan and Tibet. \"Delamu\" was followed by \"The Go Master\" (2006), a biopic of the legendary Chinese Go player, Go Seigen.\n\nThe latest work by Tian is a historical epic, \"The Warrior and the Wolf\", filmed in China's remote Xinjiang Autonomous Region. The film was originally to star Tang Wei of \"Lust, Caution\", but Tang was replaced by actress Maggie Q after the former was banned by Chinese authorities.\n\n\n\n"}

It looks out onto Pecaut Square. Part of the three-tower Metro Centre complex, the building was completed in 1992 to house the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) and its employees. The building is now used by the City of Toronto government following municipal amalgamation in 1998.\n\nFollowing Metro's inception in 1954, its politicians and employees were scattered in more than a dozen buildings around Toronto. When the new Toronto City Hall originally opened in 1964, one of its twin towers was intended for Metro Toronto offices and the other for the City of Toronto; the two councils shared the central Council Chamber. Eventually this space proved inadequate and committee facilities and councillors' offices were relocated to 390 Bay Street, across from City Hall; Metro Council continued to meet in the City Hall council chamber.\n\nTwo proposals for a new hall exclusively for Metro use were shortlisted. The proposal by CN called for a building adjacent to the SkyDome (now the Rogers Centre). The winning proposal by Marathon Realty was a cluster of three towers looking down on Roy Thomson Hall. It was built to the west of downtown in the former industrial area that saw a number of major developments around the same time.\n\nThe plan was not without controversy. The massive structure cost approximately $211 million, which many felt could be better spent. Then-North York mayor Mel Lastman harshly criticized Metro Council's decision to locate the building downtown, arguing that it would be more equitable and much cheaper to build the headquarters in the suburbs. Proponents of the plan claimed that the building would save money in the long term due to savings on rent, which by 1987 was estimated to have reached $7 million per year.\n\nThe agreement to build the new Hall was signed in 1988, and the building was completed in 1992. It was linked to the PATH underground walkway system, stretching the underground walkway system further west. Only the main building housed Metro employees with the two smaller structures rented out by Marathon to private companies. Pecaut Square, a large public square between the buildings, was completed as part of the Metro Hall project. It was formerly known as Metro Square, but in April 2011, Toronto City Council voted unanimously to rename the public space after the late civic leader David Pecaut. The lower level of the main building contains other amenities such as a community centre and library.\n\nIn 1998 the Metro level of government was merged with the city governments, and it was decided that the new city would be headquartered at Toronto's iconic City Hall. Metro Hall was nonetheless used temporarily while City Hall was refitted to accommodate the large number of councillors. The empty council chamber was used as a temporary homeless shelter in 1999 at the behest of then city councillor Jack Layton, and was converted to a 3-1-1 call centre in 2007.\n\nThere was some talk of selling Metro Hall, but it remains in use for many municipal employees. In 2001, the City government asked for bids, but the highest received was $125 million, far lower than the facility had cost. Metro Hall was used for filming in the Left Behind films as the U.N. building, or Global Community Headquarters. It was also used for many television shows including an episode of \"1-800-Missing\". A scene from the 2010 film \"Saw 3D\", involving a public trap, was filmed at Pecaut Square.\n\nMetro Hall Council Chambers inside the building have been protected under Part IV of the \"Ontario Heritage Act\", since July 2006. The designation notes that the architects are Brisbin Brook Beynon Architects. The by-law notes: \"The exterior of Metro Hall and the\ninteriors apart from the Council Chambers are not included in the Reasons for Designation\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1816139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816139", "title": "Target costing", "text": "Target costing\n\nTarget costing is an approach to determine a product's life-cycle cost which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired profit. It involves setting a target cost by subtracting a desired profit margin from a competitive market price. A target cost is the maximum amount of cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. Target costing decomposes the target cost from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, target costing spreads the competitive pressure faced by the company to product's designers and suppliers. Target costing consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting product life cycle. The cardinal rule of target costing is to never exceed the target cost. However, the focus of target costing is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of cost reduction determined by the target costing process.\n\nTarget costing is defined as \"a disciplined process for determining and achieving a full-stream cost at which a proposed product with specified functionality, performance, and quality must be produced in order to generate the desired profitability at the product’s anticipated selling price over a specified period of time in the future.\" This definition encompasses the principal concepts: products should be based on an accurate assessment of the wants and needs of customers in different market segments, and cost targets should be what result after a sustainable profit margin is subtracted from what customers are willing to pay at the time of product introduction and afterwards.\n\nThe fundamental objective of target costing is to manage the business to be profitable in a highly competitive marketplace. In effect, target costing is a proactive cost planning, cost management, and cost reduction practice whereby costs are planned and managed out of a product and business early in the design and development cycle, rather than during the later stages of product development and production.\n\nTarget costing was developed independently in both USA and Japan in different time periods. Target costing was adopted earlier by American companies to reduce cost and improve productivity, such as Ford Motor from 1900s, American Motors from 1950s-1960s. Although the ideas of target costing were also applied by a number of other American companies including Boeing, Caterpillar, Northern Telecom, few of them apply target costing as comprehensively and intensively as top Japanese companies such as Nissan, Toyota, Nippondenso. Target costing emerged from Japan from 1960s to early 1970s with the particular effort of Japanese automobile industry, including Toyota and Nissan. It did not receive global attention until late 1980s to 1990s when some authors such as Monden (1992), Sakurai (1989), Tanaka (1993), and Cooper (1992) described the way that Japanese companies applied target costing to thrive in their business (IMA 1994). With superior implementation systems, Japanese manufacturers are more successful than the American companies in developing target costing. Traditional cost-plus pricing strategy has been impeding the productivity and profitability for a long time. As a new strategy, target costing is replacing traditional cost-plus pricing strategy by maximizing customer satisfaction by accepted level of quality and functionality while minimizing costs.\n\nThe process of target costing can be divided into three sections: the first section involves in market-driven target costing, which focuses on studying market conditions to identify a product's allowable cost in order to meet the company's long-term profit at expected selling price; the second section involves performing cost reduction strategies with the product designer's effort and creativity to identify the product-level target cost; the third section is component-level target cost which decomposes the production cost to functional and component levels to transmit cost responsibility to suppliers.\nMarket driven target costing is the first section in the target costing process which focuses on studying market conditions and determining the company's profit margin in order to identify the allowable cost of a product. Market driven costing can go through 5 steps including: establish company's long-term sales and profit objective; develop the mix of products; identify target selling price for each product; identify profit margin for each product; and calculate allowable cost of each product.\n\nCompany's long-term sales and profit objectives are developed from an extensive analysis of relevant information relating to customers, market and products. Only realistic plans are accepted to proceed to the next step. Product mix is designed carefully to ensure that it satisfies many customers, but also does not contain too many products to confuse customers. Company may use simulation to explore the impact of overall profit objective to different product mixes and determine the most feasible product mix. Target selling price, target profit margin and allowable cost are identified for each product. Target selling price need to consider to the expected market condition at the time launching the product. Internal factors such as product's functionality and profit objective, and external factors such as company's image or expected price of competitive products will influence target selling price. Company's long-term profit plan and life-cycle cost are considered when determining target profit margin. Firms might set up target profit margin based on either actual profit margin of previous products or target profit margin of product line. Simulation for overall group profitability can help to make sure achieving group target. Subtracting target profit margin from target selling price results in allowable cost for each product. Allowable cost is the cost that can spend on the product to ensure meeting profit target if selling it at target price. It is the signal about the magnitude of cost saving that team need to achieve.\n\nFollowing the completion of market-driven costing, the next task of the target costing process is product-level target costing. Product-level target costing concentrates on designing products that satisfy the company's customers at the allowable cost. To achieve this goal, product-level target costing is typically divided into three steps as shown below.\nThe first step is to set a product-level target cost. Since the allowable cost is simply obtained from external conditions without considering the design capabilities of the company as well as the realistic cost for manufacturing, it may not be always achievable in practice. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the unachievable allowable cost to an achievable target cost that the cost increase should be reduced with great effort. The second step is to discipline this target cost process, including monitoring the relationship between the target cost and the estimated product cost at any point during the design process, applying the cardinal rule so that the total target costs at the component-level does not exceed the target cost of the product, and allowing exceptions for products violating the cardinal rule. For a product exception to the cardinal rule, two analyses are often performed after the launch of the product. One involves reviewing the design process to find out why the target cost was unachieved. The other is an immediate effort to reduce the excessive cost to ensure that the period of violation is as short as possible. Once the target cost-reduction objective is identified, the product-level target costing comes to the final step, finding ways to achieve it. Engineering methods such as value engineering (VE), design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA), and quality function deployment (QFD) are commonly adopted in this step.\n\nValue engineering (VE), also known as value analysis (VA), plays a crucial role in the target costing process, particularly at the product level and the component level. Among the three aforementioned methods in achieving the target cost, VE is the most critical one because not only does it attempt to reduce costs, but also aims to improve the functionality and quality of products. There are a variety of practical VE strategies, including zero-look, first-look and second-look VE approaches, as well as teardown approaches.\n\nRegarding the complexity of problems in the real world, implementing the target costing process often relies on the computer simulation to reproduce stochastic elements. For example, many firms use simulation to study the complex relationship between selling prices and profit margins, the impact of individual product decisions on overall group profitability, the right mix of products to enhance overall profit, or other economic modeling to overcome organizational inertia by getting the most productive reasoning. In addition, simulation helps estimate results rapidly for dynamic process changes.\n\nThe factors influencing the target costing process is broadly categorized based on how a company's strategy for a product's quality, functionality and price change over time. However, some factors play a specific role based on what drives a company's approach to target costing.\n\nIntensity of competition and nature of the customer affect market-driven costing. Competitors introducing similar products has been shown to drive rival companies to expend energy on implementing target costing systems such as in the case of Toyota and Nissan or Apple and Google. The costing process is also affected by the level of customer sophistication, changing requirements and the degree to which their future requirements are known. The automotive and camera industry are prime examples for how customers affect target costing based on their exact requirements.\n\nProduct strategy and product characteristics affect product-level target costing. Characteristics of product strategy such as number of products in line, rate of redesign operations and level of innovation are shown to have an effect. Higher number of products has a direct correlation with the benefits of target costing. Frequent redesigns lead to the introduction of new products that have created better benefits to target costing. It has to be noted that the value of historical information reduces with greater innovation, thereby, reducing the benefits of product level target costing.\n\nThe degree of complexity of the product, level of investments required and the duration of product development process make up the factors that affect the target costing process based on product characteristics. Product viability is determined by the aforementioned factors. In turn, the target costing process is also modified to suit the different degrees of complexity required.\n\nSupplier-Base strategy is the main factor that determines component-level target costing because it is known to play a key role in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities. There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of horizontal integration, power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. Horizontal integration captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive target costing if the buying power of firms is high enough. In turn, this may lead to better benefits. More cooperative supplier relations have been shown to increase mutual benefits in terms of target costs particularly at a component level.\n\nAside from the application of target costing in the field of manufacturing, target costing are also widely used in the following areas.\n\nAn Energy Retrofit Loan Analysis Model has been developed using a Monte Carlo (MC) method for target costing in Energy Efficient buildings and construction. MC method has been shown to be effective in determining the impact of financial uncertainties in project performance.\n\nTarget Value Design Decision Making Process (TVD-DMP) groups a set of energy efficiency methods at different optimization levels to evaluate costs and uncertainties involved in the energy efficiency process. Some major design parameters are specified using this methods including Facility Operation Schedule, Orientation, Plug load, HVAC and lighting systems.\n\nThe entire process consists of three phases: initiation, definition and alignment. Initiation stage involves developing a business case for energy efficiency using target value design (TVD) training, organization and compensation. The definition process involves defining and validating the case by tools such as values analysis and bench marking processes to determine the allowable costs. By setting targets and designing the design process to align with those targets, TVD-DMP has been shown to achieve a high level of collaboration needed for energy efficiency investments. This is done by using risk analysis tools, pull planning and rapid estimating processes.\n\nTarget costing and target value design have applications in building healthcare facilities including critical components such as Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). The process is influenced by unit locations, degree of comfort, number of patients per room, type of supply location and access to nature. According to National Vital Statistics Reports, 12.18% of 2009 births were premature and the cost per infant was $51,600. This led to opportunities for NICUs to implement target value design for deciding whether to build a single-family room or more open-bay NICUs. This was achieved using set-based design analysis which challenges the designer to generate multiple alternatives for the same functionality. Designs are evaluated keeping in mind the requirements of the various stakeholders in the NICU including nurses, doctors, family members and administrators. Unlike linear point-based design, set-based design narrows options to the optimal one by eliminating alternatives simultaneously defined by user constraints.\n\nAbout 15% construction project in Japan adopted target costing for their cost planning and management as recognized by Jacomit (2008). In the U.S., target costing research has been carried out within the framework of lean construction as target value design (TVD) method and have been disseminated widely over construction industry in recent years. Research has proven that if being applied systematically, TVD can deliver a significant improvement in project performance with average reduction of 15% in comparison with market cost.\nTVD in construction project considers the final cost of project as a design parameter, similar to the capacity and aesthetics requirements for the project. TVD requires the project team to develop a target cost from the beginning. The project team is expected not to design exceeding the target cost without the owner's approval, and must use different skills to maintain this target cost. In some cases, the cost can increase but the project team must commit to decrease and must try their best to decrease without impacting on other functions of the project.\n\n\n"}

(His grandfather fought in the Prussian Army against Napoleon.) He attended the Brunswick Military Academy and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Brunswick Army in 1841. In 1847 he resigned his commission and emigrated to the United States, settling in Alabama. He served as an engineer in the U.S. Coast Survey, surveying the United States–Mexico border and Mobile Bay, Alabama, but his desire to serve in a combat position in the Mexican–American War was denied and he returned to Brunswick in 1849, but not before marrying 19-year-old Florence Mary of Mobile, Alabama. He returned to the United States in 1854 and purchased a farm near Wallingford, Connecticut. He later moved to New York state.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Steinwehr raised a regiment, consisting primarily of German immigrants, the 29th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which he commanded at the First Battle of Bull Run. The regiment was in reserve during the battle, but served an important screening role during the Union retreat. He was promoted to brigadier general on October 12, 1861, and commanded the 2nd Brigade of Louis Blenker's division of the Army of the Potomac. This brigade was moved into Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont's Mountain Department on April 1, 1862, and it fought in the Valley Campaign against Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Fremont's command was expanded into an army corps, which was soon commanded by Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel, another German immigrant. Steinwehr was given the 2nd Division in that corps. It was assigned to the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, and participated in the Northern Virginia Campaign, but had little role in the Second Battle of Bull Run. Although the corps joined the Army of the Potomac, the division did not fight at the Battle of Antietam or the Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nThe command of what was now called the XI Corps changed to Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard in 1863, and Steinwehr continued to command the division in the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg. The corps was the victim of the surprise flanking attack by Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, and the overwhelming attack by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps on the first day of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. At Chancellorsville, Steinwehr's division had one brigade, that of Col Adolphus Buschbeck involved in resisting Jackson's attack. At Gettysburg, when the corps was forced to retreat back through the town to Cemetery Hill, Col Charles Coster took a brigade of Steinwehr's division out to the edge of the town, where it sacrificed itself buying time for the retreating soldiers of the other two divisions. These two defeats seriously degraded the combat effectiveness of the XI Corps and humiliated many of the German immigrant soldiers in the corps. Nevertheless, Steinwehr was well thought of by his superiors. After Chancellorsville, General Howard wrote that Steinwehr's bearing during the battle was \"cool, collected and judicious.\" Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams, a fellow division commander, described him as a \"remarkably intelligent and agreeable person.\"\n\nIn September 1863, two divisions of the XI Corps, those of Steinwehr and MG Carl Schurz, were transferred to the Western Theater to help relieve the besieged Union army in Chattanooga, becoming part of the Army of the Cumberland. They served under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker in the Battle of Wauhatchie, where the brigade of Col Orland Smith from Steinwehr's division distinguished itself. Buschbeck's brigade was engaged alongside Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's command at the Third Battle of Chattanooga. After that battle the XI Corps was combined with the equally depleted XII Corps to form the new XX Corps. That corps fought under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in the Atlanta Campaign and March to the Sea, but Steinwehr was essentially reorganized out of his job and he commanded no more combat units during the war. He resigned his commission on July 3, 1865.\n\nAfter the war, Steinwehr was employed as a geographer and cartographer. He returned to Connecticut to accept a professorship at Yale University. He moved to Washington, D.C., then to Ohio, and returned to New York. He died in Buffalo, New York, and is buried in Albany Rural Cemetery, Menands, New York. Steinwehr was a prolific author, including \"A School Geography: Embracing a Mathematical, Physical, and Political Descriptions of the Earth\" (published in 1870); co-author of \"Primary Geography\" (1870) and \"An Elementary Treatise on Physical Geography\" (1873); editor of \"The Centennial Gazetteer of the United States\" (1874). He is memorialized by the prominent Steinwehr Avenue in the borough of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}

With the exception of a few inland diversions, the path follows the coast of the Solent, the sea strait that separates the mainland England from the Isle of Wight. The Solent Way forms part of the E9 European Coastal Path, which runs for 5000 km (3125 miles) from Cape St Vincent in Portugal to Narva-Jõesuu in Estonia.\nThe Solent Way starts in the seaside resort of Milford on Sea, where it connects with the Bournemouth Coast Path. It then follows the coastline and the shingle spit to the fortifications of Hurst Castle. From Hurst Castle there are two alternative routes, one involving retracing steps along the shingle spit (Hurst Spit), the other catching the seasonal ferry to Keyhaven. From Keyhaven the route follows the marshes and former saltings to the port and sailing centre of Lymington.\n\nFrom Lymington the Solent Way crosses the Lymington River then continues a mile or so inland of the coast, giving occasional glimpses to the busy Solent to the south-east. Soon the path enters the New Forest, passing Sowley Pond before reaching Bucklers Hard on the Beaulieu River. From Bucklers Hard the path follows the edge of the river to Beaulieu and on to Hythe on the west bank of the Southampton Water. From Hythe the path takes the Hythe Ferry across Southampton Water to the Town Quay in the centre of the port city of Southampton.\n\nFrom Southampton the Solent Way passes through the city centre, crosses the River Itchen by the high-level Itchen Bridge and follows the northern shore of Southampton Water past Netley Castle, the ruins of Netley Abbey, and the Royal Victoria Country Park to the yachting centre of Hamble-le-Rice. Here it crosses the River Hamble on the small pedestrian Hamble-Warsash Ferry to the village of Warsash.\n\nFrom Warsash, the north shore of the Solent is regained, and followed past Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve and through the seaside centres of Hill Head and Lee-on-Solent to the town of Gosport on the western side of Portsmouth Harbour. Here the Gosport Ferry is used to cross Portsmouth Harbour to Portsmouth Harbour railway station in the centre of the naval city of Portsmouth.\n\nThe Solent Way then follows the seaside promenade through the resort of Southsea, and along the western and northern shores of Langstone Harbour past Farlington Marshes Nature Reserve to the village of Langstone. From Langstone the path follows the north coast of Chichester Harbour and passes Warblington Castle before reaching its end at the village of Emsworth.\n\nThe way is marked by circular discs bearing a green arrow and a picture of a tern. These are attached to wooden posts and street furniture along the route.\n\n\n"}

Its MPs elected were: Conservative Party candidates for 107 years and Labour Party candidates for 18 years. The closing 40 years of the seat's history saw Conservative victory — in 1997 on a very marginal majority in relative terms.\n\nThe seat began with the market towns Uxbridge and Staines shedding the latter and its southern half in 1918; by 1945 more new seats were needed. Its eastern area merited Southall and the loss of Northolt to Ealing West (all new seats) and in 1950 of Ruislip, Northwood and Harefield to become Ruislip-Northwood and of Hayes and Harlington, taking up eastern territory and some of that lost in 1918. In each possible boundary reform the seat was reduced reflecting population expansion of areas outlying its core area of Uxbridge and interwoven Hillingdon, Cowley and Ickenham.\n\n1885–1918: The parliamentary constituency of Uxbridge was created as the westernmost county division of the historic county of Middlesex. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 defined the seat as comprising the parishes of Ashford*, Bedfont, Cowley, Cranford, Feltham, Hampton, Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Harefield, Harlington, Harmondsworth, Hayes, Hillingdon East, Hillingdon West, Ickenham, Laleham*, Littleton*, Northolt, Ruislip, Shepperton*, Staines*, Stanwell*, Sunbury*, Teddington, Uxbridge, West Drayton, and Yiewsley. The shape of the seat was irregular and it stretched more than three times the maximum length than its final form and twice its breadth.\n\nThe parishes (as various successor urban districts) marked * were absorbed into Surrey and the others absorbed into Greater London, in 1965.\n1918–1945: Uxbridge was cut down to be a north-western division of Middlesex. Large areas to the south were removed to form Spelthorne (UK Parliament constituency).\n\nThe local government areas in the new Uxbridge seat were defined, by the Representation of the People Act 1918, as the urban districts of Hayes, Ruislip-Northwood, Southall-Norwood, Uxbridge, and Yiewsley as well as the Uxbridge Rural District.\n\n1945–1950: included in 1945's interim redistribution of seats with more than 100,000 registered electors. Reduced to the urban districts of Ruislip-Northwood and Uxbridge. This saw contributions to two new seats: Southall, almost its whole; Ealing West, (as to Northolt); a cast-off for five years to Spelthorne of southerly Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District.\n\n1950–1974: Under 1950 redistribution, Ruislip-Northwood became a new seat in the north and north-east. Uxbridge with immediate neighbours north south and east (together forming the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge in 1955) was re-united with Yiewsley and West Drayton, to form the last incarnation of the county division.\n\nIn 1965 saw the last major Local Government reform. Area covered became part of the London Borough of Hillingdon.\n\n1974–1983: The seat was re-classified as a borough constituency. Its wards were for approximately an identical area as before: \"Colham-Cowley, Harefield, Hillingdon East, Hillingdon West, Ickenham, Uxbridge, and Yiewsley\".\n\n1983–1997: ward names in local government, not coverage, changed to: \"Colham, Cowley, Harefield, Hillingdon East, Hillingdon North, Hillingdon West, Ickenham, Uxbridge North, Uxbridge South, West Drayton, and Yiewsley\".\n\n1997–2010: Harefield ward was lost to Ruislip-Northwood, list/extent above (1983-1997) otherwise unchanged.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in North London, the Boundary Commission for England created a new constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\n\nA number of electoral wards in Hillingdon were moved into the new constituency of Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner\n\n\n"}

The serial introduced the robot dog K9, voiced by John Leeson.\n\nIn the serial, an intelligent virus intends to spread across the universe after finding a suitable spawning location on the moon Titan.\n\nMankind is colonising space at a fantastic rate. Some human space travellers are cruising near the outer planets of the solar system with their ship on autopilot. The ship's computer, and soon the human crew, is possessed by a strange virus. Reaching their destination, Titan Base, they proceed to take it over as a breeding ground. The station manager, Lowe is able to send out a distress call.\n\nThe TARDIS is travelling through the same region, and is infected by the virus. The infection passes to the Fourth Doctor, but he is unaffected. He and Leela hear the distress call and go to investigate. While there, the Doctor is overcome by repeated infections and is chosen, due to his incredible powers as a Time Lord, to be the host of the Nucleus of the Swarm. Leela is unable to be infected.\n\nThe Nucleus declares her a reject and orders that she be killed. The Doctor manages to break free of his infection and tells Leela how to get the TARDIS to the nearest medical centre. Accompanying them is Lowe, who has been infected, although the Doctor and Leela don't know this.\n\nAt the medical station, the Doctor's doctor, Professor Marius, introduces the group to K9, a robotic dog he made to replace the real dog he had to leave on Earth. Professor Marius is baffled as to how to treat the Doctor's strange infection. Meanwhile, Lowe has been infecting the staff of the hospital.\n\nLeela and the Doctor decide on a last-ditch strategy. They create clones of themselves, which can only survive for ten minutes due to problems with the technique. The clones will then be shrunk and inserted into the Doctor. There they will destroy the Nucleus and escape through a tear duct. In the meantime, Leela and K9 fight off the infected staff of the hospital.\n\nAfter a hazardous voyage through his mind, the Doctor's clone and Leela's clone are separated, and the Doctor's clone reaches the Nucleus. He has no weapons with which to destroy it, and it learns the intended escape route of the Doctor's clone, since the Doctor thought of it. Prof. Marius faithfully retrieves something from the tear duct and expands it to human size. It turns out to be the Nucleus. The Doctor is cured of his infection.\n\nThe Nucleus and the infected staff leave for Titan Base so the Nucleus can spawn. The Doctor realises he is cured since Leela's clone introduced into his blood stream her immunity factor. He replicates it and gives it to Prof. Marius. The Doctor, Leela, and K9 proceed to Titan Base in the TARDIS.\n\nThey fight off the infected humans, but are again without sufficient weaponry to destroy the Nucleus, or its many children, which are about to hatch as \"macro-sized\" beings, like the newly macro-sized Nucleus. The Doctor jams the door they are behind and rigs a gun to fire into a cloud of oxygen gas he is releasing and escapes. As intended, when the Swarm finally forces open the door, the blaster fires, igniting the oxygen in Titan's methane atmosphere and destroying the Swarm and the base.\n\nWhen they return to the hospital, they thank Prof. Marius for the use of K9, who has ably assisted them. Prof. Marius offers K9 to the Doctor, as he is due to return to Earth, and the Doctor and Leela leave with their new companion in the TARDIS.\n\nWorking titles for this story included \"The Enemy Within\", \"The Invader Within\" and \"The Invisible Invader\". It was not decided until late in the production that K9 was to be a new companion. The decision to use it in multiple serials was made partly to offset the expense that had gone into making the prop.\n\n\"The Invisible Enemy\" was filmed and recorded in April 1977. In one scene there is an obvious crack in a wall before it is fired at by K9; the crack was originally concealed, but the scene was reshot with little time left to repair the join.\n\nMichael Sheard (Lowe) makes his fourth of six appearances in \"Doctor Who\", having made previous appearances in \"The Ark\" (1966), \"The Mind of Evil\" (1971) and \"Pyramids of Mars\" (1975). Brian Grellis previously played Sheprah in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975) and would later appear as the Megaphone Man in \"Snakedance\" (1983). Frederick Jaeger (Marius) also played Jano in \"The Savages\" (1966) and Professor Sorenson in \"Planet of Evil\" (1975).\n\nThe story was repeated on BBC1 on consecutive Thursdays from 13 July – 3 August 1978, achieving ratings of 4.9, 5.5, 5.1 and 6.8 million viewers respectively.\n\nReviewing the serial for \"The Times\" newspaper on the Monday following the second episode's transmission, critic Stanley Reynolds gave the story a generally negative reception. He also pointed out that in ITV regions where the series was competing with \"Man from Atlantis\" in the Saturday early evening slot, it was now losing the ratings war.\n\nMore recent reviews have also not been positive. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), \"An ambitious project which has the look of a grand folly due to budget constraints and the tongue-in-cheek script... K9 makes a quite impressive debut, though, as with many aspects of The Invisible Enemy, the ideas are better than the realisation.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker called it one of the \"weakest\" Fourth Doctor stories, mostly consisting of \"clichéd and undemanding action-adventure material\". They also noted the inconsistent visual effects. In 2010, Mark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" was not harsh, although he felt there was a \"precarious juxtaposition\" between good and bad effects, and criticised some incompetent action scenes. DVD Talk's John Sinnott disliked the way K9 was used too conveniently and found the plot too similar to but less well done than \"Fantastic Voyage\". He praised the visual effects of the inside of the Doctor's head, but criticised the other sets.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in March 1979.\n\nThe story was released on VHS in September 2002. The DVD was released on 16 June 2008 with the spin off \"K-9 and Company\" in a double pack called \"K9 Tales\". This serial was scheduled to be released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 133 on 5 February 2014.\n\n"}

Warren, to miss the attack while searching for them - one of the pretexts used by Sheridan for his controversial sacking of Warren.\n\nCrawford was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1846 and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1850. He joined the U.S. Army as an assistant surgeon in 1851 and served in that capacity for ten years.\n\nCrawford was the surgeon on duty at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, during the Confederate bombardment in 1861, which represented the start of the Civil War. Despite his purely medical background, he was in command of several of the artillery pieces returning fire from the fort.\n\nA month after Fort Sumter, Crawford decided on a fundamental career change and accepted a commission as a major in the 13th U.S. Infantry. He served as Assistant Inspector General of the Department of the Ohio starting in September 1861. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on April 25, 1862, and led a brigade in the Department of the Shenandoah, participating in the Valley Campaign against Stonewall Jackson, but the brigade saw no actual combat. Its first taste of battle was during the Northern Virginia Campaign, when it was assigned to the Army of Virginia under Maj. Gen. John Pope. At the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Crawford's brigade launched a surprise attack upon the Confederate left, routing a division that included the Stonewall Brigade. The Confederates counterattacked, however, and Crawford's brigade, which was unsupported by other units, was driven back with 50% casualties.\n\nAt the Battle of Antietam, Crawford temporarily commanded his division when Brig. Gen Alpheus S. Williams was elevated to command the XII Corps. Crawford's temporary command was short, however, when he was wounded in the right thigh. He stayed on the field until he became weak from loss of blood and had to be carried off. The wound took eight months to heal properly and he was unable to return to the field until May 1863, when he was given command of the Pennsylvania Reserves Division in the defenses of Washington, D.C. In commanding this division, Crawford was following in the footsteps of two Union Army luminaries: John F. Reynolds and George G. Meade.\n\nIn June 1863, the Pennsylvania Reserves Division was added to the Army of the Potomac for the Gettysburg Campaign. Crawford was in a difficult situation. His training was as a surgeon, not as an infantry officer, and although he had experience at the brigade level, his eight-month recuperation meant that his skills were at minimal levels at the start of a critical campaign. Furthermore, the troops of his division had just spent six months on easy garrison duty around Washington and were not fully combat ready. On July 2, 1863, Crawford and his division arrived at Gettysburg in the rear of the V Corps, led by Maj. Gen. George Sykes. He was ordered to the front to assist the brigade of Col. Strong Vincent on Little Round Top, but the battle had already petered out by the time his division arrived.\n\nMeanwhile, the Confederate troops of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's Corps had swept through the Devil's Den, driving the Union defenders back to Plum Run, a stream just to the west of Little Round Top, and an area that became known to the soldiers as \"the Valley of Death\". Crawford's division swept down the slope of Little Round Top along with the brigades of Colonels William McCandless and David J. Nevin. McCandless's brigade led the charge, but Crawford apparently desired some of the glory and seized his own division's colors from a surprised sergeant to lead them in the charge, too. The charge was successful, meeting little resistance, and the Confederates were driven from the Valley of Death.\n\nAlthough this was a relatively minor engagement and casualties were light, Crawford spent the remainder of his life basking in the glory of Little Round Top. After the war, Crawford was prominent in preserving the Gettysburg Battlefield and at one point attempted to raise money to cover the hill with a large memorial building and museum dedicated to his division. (This plan was a failure, and Little Round Top remains close to its original condition, although sprinkled with smaller monuments.) Crawford also spent considerable effort politicking to get the official records of the war to acknowledge his role as the savior of Little Round Top, but he was also unsuccessful in this quest.\n\nCrawford remained in command of the Pennsylvania Reserve Division in the V Corps for the rest of the war. In the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign he also commanded a garrison in the siege that consisted of his first two brigades, a division from the IX Corps, and a few other regiments and artillery units; his third brigade was temporarily assigned to another V Corps division. On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Crawford for appointment to the brevet grade of major general, to rank from August 1, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on February 14, 1865. On August 18, he was wounded at the chest in the action at the Weldon Railroad. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in the regular army for the Battle of Five Forks and to major general on March 13, 1865. At Five Forks, his division drifted away through heavy woods from the main attack on the Confederate left. Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, commander of V Corps, personally rode off to retrieve Crawford's division. His absence during the attack was one of the reasons cited by Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan to relieve Warren. Although Crawford was the senior general in the corps, Sheridan named a more junior officer (Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin) to replace Warren.\n\nCrawford was present for Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, making him one of the few soldiers to be present at both the beginning and the effective end of the Civil War.\n\nCrawford retired from the Army on February 19, 1873, and was given the rank of brigadier general, U.S. Army Retired. He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is buried there in Laurel Hill Cemetery. He was the author of \"The Genesis of the Civil War\", published in 1887.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1816154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816154", "title": "Indo-Iranians", "text": "Indo-Iranians\n\nIndo-Iranian peoples, also known as Indo-Iranic peoples by scholars, and sometimes as Arya or Aryans from their self-designation, were a group of Indo-European peoples who brought the Indo-Iranian languages, a major branch of the Indo-European language family, to major parts of Eurasia in the second part of the 3rd millennium BCE. They eventually branched out into Iranian peoples and Indo-Aryan peoples.\n\nThe term \"Aryan\" has been used historically to denote the \"Indo-Iranians\", because \"Arya\" is the self designation of the ancient speakers of the Indo-Iranian languages, specifically the Iranian and the Indo-Aryan peoples, collectively known as the Indo-Iranians. Some scholars now use the term Indo-Iranian to refer to this group, while the term \"Aryan\" is used to mean \"Indo-Iranian\" by other scholars such as Josef Wiesehofer, Will Durant, and Jaakko Häkkinen. Population geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, in his 1994 book \"The History and Geography of Human Genes\", also uses the term Aryan to describe the Indo-Iranians.\n\nThe early Indo-Iranians are commonly identified with the descendants of the Proto-Indo-Europeans known as the Sintashta culture and the subsequent Andronovo culture within the broader Andronovo horizon, and their homeland with an area of the Eurasian steppe that borders the Ural River on the west, the Tian Shan on the east (where the Indo-Iranians took over the area occupied by the earlier Afanasevo culture), and Transoxiana and the Hindu Kush on the south.\n\nBased on its use by Indo-Aryans in Mitanni and Vedic India, its prior absence in the Near East and Harappan India, and its 19th–20th century BC attestation at the Andronovo site of Sintashta, Kuzmina (1994) argues that the chariot corroborates the identification of Andronovo as Indo-Iranian. dated a chariot burial at Krivoye Lake to about 2000 BC, and a Bactria-Margiana burial that also contains a foal has recently been found, indicating further links with the steppes.\n\nHistorical linguists broadly estimate that a continuum of Indo-Iranian languages probably began to diverge by 2000 BC, if not earlier, preceding both the Vedic and Iranian cultures. The earliest recorded forms of these languages, Vedic Sanskrit and Gathic Avestan, are remarkably similar, descended from the common Proto-Indo-Iranian language. The origin and earliest relationship between the Nuristani languages and that of the Iranian and Indo-Aryan groups is not completely clear.\n\nTwo-wave models of Indo-Iranian expansion have been proposed by Burrow (1973) and . The Indo-Iranians and their expansion are strongly associated with the Proto-Indo-European invention of the chariot. It is assumed that this expansion spread from the Proto-Indo-European homeland north of the Caspian sea south to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Iranian plateau, and Indian subcontinent. They also expanded into Mesopotamia and Syria and introduced the horse and chariot culture to this part of the world.\n\nThe Mitanni, a people known in eastern Anatolia from about 1500 BC, were of possibly of mixed origins: a Hurrian-speaking majority was supposedly dominated by a non-Anatolian, Indo-Aryan elite. There is linguistic evidence for such a superstrate, in the form of:\nIn particular, Kikkuli's text includes words such as \"aika\" \"one\" (i.e. a cognate of the Indo-Aryan \"eka\"), \"tera\" \"three\" (\"tri\"), \"panza\" \"five\" (\"pancha\"), \"satta\" \"seven\", (\"sapta\"), \"na\" \"nine\" (\"nava\"), and \"vartana\" \"turn around\", in the context of a horse race (Indo-Aryan \"vartana\"). In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, the Ashvin deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya are invoked. These loanwords tend to connect the Mitanni superstrate to Indo-Aryan rather than Iranian languages – i.e. the early Iranian word for \"one\" was \"aiva\".\n\nThe standard model for the entry of the Indo-European languages into the Indian subcontinent is that this first wave went over the Hindu Kush, either into the headwaters of the Indus and later the Ganges. The earliest stratum of Vedic Sanskrit, preserved only in the Rigveda, is assigned to roughly 1500 BC. From the Indus, the Indo-Aryan languages spread from c. 1500 BC to c. 500 BC, over the northern and central parts of the subcontinent, sparing the extreme south. The Indo-Aryans in these areas established several powerful kingdoms and principalities in the region, from south eastern Afghanistan to the doorstep of Bengal. The most powerful of these kingdoms were the post-Rigvedic Kuru (in Kurukshetra and the Delhi area) and their allies the Pañcālas further east, as well as Gandhara and later on, about the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Kosala and the quickly expanding realm of Magadha. The latter lasted until the 4th century BC, when it was conquered by Chandragupta Maurya and formed the center of the Mauryan empire.\n\nIn eastern Afghanistan and southwestern Pakistan, whatever Indo-Aryan languages were spoken there were eventually pushed out by the Iranian languages. Most Indo-Aryan languages, however, were and still are prominent in the rest of the Indian subcontinent. Today, Indo-Aryan languages are spoken in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Suriname and the Maldives.\n\nThe second wave is interpreted as the Iranian wave.\nThe first Iranians to reach the Black Sea may have been the Cimmerians in the 8th century BC, although their linguistic affiliation is uncertain. They were followed by the Scythians, who are considered a western branch of the Central Asian Sakas. Sarmatian tribes, of whom the best known are the Roxolani (Rhoxolani), Iazyges (Jazyges) and the Alani (Alans), followed the Scythians westwards into Europe in the late centuries BC and the 1st and 2nd centuries AD (The Age of Migrations). The populous Sarmatian tribe of the Massagetae, dwelling near the Caspian Sea, were known to the early rulers of Persia in the Achaemenid Period. At their greatest reported extent, around 1st century AD, the Sarmatian tribes ranged from the Vistula River to the mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga, bordering the shores of the Black and Caspian seas as well as the Caucasus to the south. In the east, the Saka occupied several areas in Xinjiang, from Khotan to Tumshuq.\n\nThe Medians, Persians and Parthians begin to appear on the Iranian plateau from c. 800 BC, and the Achaemenids replaced Elamite rule from 559 BC. Around the first millennium AD, Iranian groups began to settle on the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau, on the mountainous frontier of northwestern and western Pakistan, displacing the earlier Indo-Aryans from the area.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, the Iranians were eventually decisively assimilated (e.g. Slavicisation) and absorbed by the Proto-Slavic population of the region, while in Central Asia, the Turkic languages marginalized the Iranian languages as a result of the Turkic expansion of the early centuries AD. Extant major Iranian languages are Persian, Pashto, Kurdish, and Balochi besides numerous smaller ones. Ossetian, primarily spoken in North Ossetia and South Ossetia, is a direct descendant of Alanic, and by that the only surviving Sarmatian language of the once wide-ranging East Iranian dialect continuum that stretched from Eastern Europe to the eastern parts of Central Asia.\n\nArchaeological cultures associated with Indo-Iranian expansion include:\n suggests the following identifications:\nThe Indo-European language spoken by the Indo-Iranians in the late 3rd millennium BC was a Satem language still not removed very far from the Proto-Indo-European language, and in turn only removed by a few centuries from Vedic Sanskrit of the Rigveda. The main phonological change separating Proto-Indo-Iranian from Proto–Indo-European is the collapse of the ablauting vowels \"*e, *o, *a\" into a single vowel, Proto–Indo-Iranian \"*a\" (but see Brugmann's law). Grassmann's law and Bartholomae's law were also complete in Proto-Indo-Iranian, as well as the loss of the labiovelars (kw, etc.) to k, and the Eastern Indo-European (Satem) shift from palatized k' to ć, as in Proto–Indo-European *k'ṃto- > Indo-Iran. *ćata- > Sanskrit śata-, Old Iran. sata\n\"100\".\n\nAmong the sound changes from Proto-Indo-Iranian to Indo-Aryan is the loss of the voiced sibilant \"*z\", among those to Iranian is the de-aspiration of the PIE voiced aspirates.\n\nDespite the introduction of later Hindu and Zoroastrian scriptures, Indo-Iranians shared a common inheritance of concepts including the universal force \"*Hṛta-\" (Sanskrit \"rta\", Avestan \"asha\"), the sacred plant and drink \"*sawHma-\" (Sanskrit \"Soma\", Avestan \"Haoma\") and gods of social order such as \"*mitra-\" (Sanskrit \"Mitra\", Avestan and Old Persian \"Mithra\", \"Miϑra\") and \"*bʰaga-\" (Sanskrit \"Bhaga\", Avestan and Old Persian \"Baga\"). Proto-Indo-Iranian religion is an archaic offshoot of Indo-European religion. From the various and dispersed Indo-Iranian cultures, a set of common ideas may be reconstructed from which a common, unattested proto-Indo-Iranian source may be deduced.\n\nThe pre-Islamic religion of the Nuristani people and extant religion of the Kalash people, is mostly based on the original religion of the Indo-Iranians, some of which are shared with Shinto, one of the national religions of Japan, which has some Indo-Iranian influence owing to contact presumably in the steppes of Central Asia at around 2000 BCE. In Shinto, traces of these can be seen in the myth of the storm god Susanoo slaying a serpent Yamata-no-Orochi and in the myth of the dawn goddess Ame-no-Uzume.\n\nBeliefs developed in different ways as cultures separated and evolved. For example, the cosmo-mythology of the peoples that remained on the Central Asian steppes and the Iranian plateau is to a great degree unlike that of the Indians, focused more on groups of deities (\"*daiva\" and \"*asura\") and less on the divinities individually. Indians were less conservative than Iranians in their treatment of their divinities, so that some deities were conflated with others or, conversely, aspects of a single divinity developed into divinities in their own right. By the time of Zoroaster, Iranian culture had also been subject to the upheavals of the Iranian Heroic Age (late Iranian Bronze Age, 1800–800 BC), an influence that the Indo-Aryans were not subject to.\n\nSometimes certain myths developed in altogether different ways. The Rig-Vedic Sarasvati is linguistically and functionally cognate with Avestan *Haraxvaitī Ārəduuī Sūrā Anāhitā. In the Rig-Veda (6,61,5–7) she battles a serpent called Vritra, who has hoarded all of the Earth's water. In contrast, in early portions of the Avesta, Iranian *Harahvati \"is\" the world-river that flows down from the mythical central Mount Hara. But *Harahvati does no battle — she is blocked by an obstacle (Avestan for obstacle: \"vərəϑra\") placed there by Angra Mainyu.\n\nThe following is a list of cognate terms that may be gleaned from comparative linguistic analysis of the Rigveda and Avesta. Both collections are from the period after the proposed date of separation (c. 2nd millennium BC) of the Proto-Indo-Iranians into their respective Indic and Iranian branches.\n\nR1a1a (R-M17 or R-M198) is the sub-clade most commonly associated with Indo-European speakers. Most discussions purportedly of R1a origins are actually about the origins of the dominant R1a1a (R-M17 or R-M198) sub-clade. Data so far collected indicates that there are two widely separated areas of high frequency, one in the northern Indian subcontinent, and the other in Eastern Europe, around Poland and Ukraine. The historical and prehistoric possible reasons for this are the subject of on-going discussion and attention amongst population geneticists and genetic genealogists, and are considered to be of potential interest to linguists and archaeologists also.\n\nOut of 10 human male remains assigned to the Andronovo horizon from the Krasnoyarsk region, 9 possessed the R1a Y-chromosome haplogroup and one C-M130 haplogroup (xC3). mtDNA haplogroups of nine individuals assigned to the same Andronovo horizon and region were as follows: U4 (2 individuals), U2e, U5a1, Z, T1, T4, H, and K2b.\n\nA 2004 study also established that during the Bronze Age/Iron Age period, the majority of the population of Kazakhstan (part of the Andronovo culture during Bronze Age), was of west Eurasian origin (with mtDNA haplogroups such as U, H, HV, T, I and W), and that prior to the 13th–7th century BC, all Kazakh samples belonged to European lineages.\n\n\n\n\n"}
