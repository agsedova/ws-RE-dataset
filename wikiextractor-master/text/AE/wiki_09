Meier & Frank operated in the Pacific Northwest from 1857 to 2006.\n\nMeier & Frank was founded in Portland, Oregon in 1857, and acquired in 1966 by May Department Stores. May operated it as a separate division for nearly forty years, expanding the chain to Utah in 2001, as a result of a conversion of May Company's Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) stores purchased in 1999. In 2002, May consolidated its operation with North Hollywood, California-based Robinsons-May, but retained the historic Meier & Frank name in the Oregon, Utah, and Washington markets.\n\nFederated Department Stores, the parent company of Macy's, acquired May on August 30, 2005. Federated dissolved the former May Company divisions and merged operational control of the Meier & Frank stores with Macy's Northwest. Federated decided to rename the store chains that it had acquired through its takeover of May – including Meier & Frank – as Macy's, and the change took effect about a year later. The final day of operation under the Meier & Frank name was September 8, 2006. (The following year, Federated also changed its own name to Macy's, Inc.)\n\nThe company's flagship store was the historic Meier & Frank Building. This location later became Macy's at Meier & Frank Square and closed in May 2017. The building was restored with little attention to historical accuracy paid to the interior. The lower five floors and basement were occupied by Macy's, following completion of renovation of that part of the building in October 2007. The nine upper floors were converted in 2007–08 to a luxury hotel, \"The Nines\" (the name coming from a play on words combining the number of stories the hotel occupies with the idea of spiffy dress).\n\nIn 1857, Aaron Meier (1831–1889) arrived in the Oregon Territory at the age of 26 and opened a mercantile store at 137 Front Street in Portland, which had a population of 1,300. He had come to California from Bavaria during the Gold Rush, spending time as an itinerant peddler in southern Oregon. He formed a partnership with a Mr. Mariholtz and began selling merchandise that arrived by steamer from San Francisco and in the covered wagons rolling along the Oregon Trail. Ten years later, Meier returned to Ellerstadt (in today's Rhineland-Palatinate) after his father died, leaving Mariholtz to run the business. During his extended stay in Ellerstadt, Meier married a local woman, Jeanette Hirsch (1843–1925) and returned with her to Portland. Meanwhile, back in Portland the dry goods store had collapsed financially, bringing the partnership to an end. Aaron Meier started a new store with his $14,000 inheritance, in larger quarters of , at 136 Front Street. He hired Emil Frank (1845–1898) in 1870 and Emil's younger brother Sigmund Frank (1850–1910) in 1872. A year later, Emil Frank became Meier's partner and the store became known as \"Meier & Frank\".\n\nIn 1878, the great Portland fire destroyed 20 downtown blocks, including the store, which was immediately rebuilt. Sigmund Frank became a partner in the store in 1884, and a year later married Aaron's only daughter, Fannie Meier (1865–1930). In 1885, Meier & Frank built its own two-story masonry building, , on Taylor Street between First and Second. Two years later the store held the first \"Friday Surprise\" sale on April 29.\n\nIn 1888, Emil Frank left the partnership after years of simmering management differences, and Sigmund Frank became Meier's sole partner just before Meier died in 1889. The name of the store thus remained \"Meier & Frank\". Sigmund became the president and Aaron Meier's widow, Jeannette Hirsch Meier, ran the store behind the scenes, having brought several half-brothers and nephews from Bavaria to work in the store.\n\nIn the great flood of 1894, the street level of Meier & Frank was three feet deep in water. Customers were brought into the store in rowboats and stepped onto raised walkways to do their shopping.\n\nMeier & Frank emerged as \"One of America’s Great Stores\" as it moved uptown into its elegant five-story building, , on Fifth Street (now Fifth Avenue) between Alder and Morrison in 1898. The building had two elevators and many mechanical innovations never before seen on the Pacific Coast. The opening of the building marked the transition from the old \"country store\" type of operation to a modern department store. The \"new look\" represented of floor space, 68 times more than when Aaron Meier began 40 years earlier. Meier & Frank pioneered the concept of a \"money-back guarantee\", until then unheard-of in merchandising.\n\nTen years later, the store erected an adjacent annex of , ten stories above the street, with two basements, making it the tallest store in the Pacific Northwest and Portland's lone skyscraper. Designed by architect A. E. Doyle, its white terra-cotta exterior set a design trend in downtown Portland, leading to the famed \"wall of white\" on S.W. Alder. At Sigmund Frank's death, Aaron Meier's elder son Abe Meier (1868–1930) became president, serving as the store's greeter, while his younger son, Julius (1874–1937), became vice president and general manager—running the store. The store's green delivery wagons (later its delivery trucks) were ubiquitous in Portland, with the company willing to deliver purchases of any size—even a spool of thread.\n\nThe company provided the furnishings for the Fairmount Hotel, constructed to serve out-of-town visitors to the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition.\nIn 1913, the five-story building on Fifth Street was demolished, and construction began on a new sixteen-story building, which opened in 1915, giving the store of retail space. Early on, Meier & Frank was one of the few stores to maintain a buying office in New York. Sales representatives there would joke that there were four major markets on the West Coast: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Meier & Frank. In 1920, a full square-block garage and stockroom facility, four stories high, opened on N.W. 14th and 15th between Everett and Flanders. The Retail Reserve Building, eight stories high, opened at N.W. Irving between 14th and 15th in 1923. A year earlier, Meier & Frank's radio station KFEC, with its antenna atop the 16-story building, began broadcasting from its studio on the fifth floor. The station's slogan was \"KFEC--The Meier & Frank Station\". Meanwhile, Clark Gable worked at Meier & Frank selling neckties.\n\nThe president of Meier & Frank, Julius L. Meier, was elected governor of Oregon as an independent, and served from 1931 to 1935.\nCombining the 1909 and 1915 buildings with construction on the final quarter-block and topping the consolidated building off at 17 stories, Meier & Frank now filled the entire block bounded by S.W. Alder, Morrison, 5th, and 6th. Locals jocularly referred to the store as \"Murphy & Finnigan's\". For a time, Meier & Frank reigned as the largest retail outlet west of the Mississippi and one of the largest stores in the nation in the early 1930s. When President Roosevelt closed banks country-wide, Meier & Frank took out a full-page newspaper ad with a single word: \"Confidence\". Hundreds of people brought their savings to the store for safekeeping. The store cancelled interest charges on all customers' credit accounts.\n\nWhen Julius Meier died in 1937, his nephew, Aaron (Bud) Meier Frank (1891–1968) became president of the store, a position he would hold for nearly 40 years, becoming the most important businessman in Portland for decades.\n\nDuring World War II, Meier & Frank supported the allied forces: Federal officials cited the store's efforts in support of the war 1941 to 1945 as the most outstanding of any department store in the United States. Meier & Frank devoted \"all\" of its newspaper advertising space to bond sales; for 1,207 continuous days the back page of the first section of \"The Oregonian\" ran ads—not to sell merchandise but to support the war effort. The store conducted the largest single sale of war bonds in the nation, a $32-million sale that lasted two weeks in the store's auditorium.\n\nAfter the war, it completed installation of the longest continuous up/down escalator system in the world, serving all selling floors of the store and costing $1.5 million. Two years later, M&F demolished the Portland Hotel and built a two-level parking facility on a full block southwest of the store, between S.W. 6th, Broadway, Morrison, and Alder. In the late 1960s, Meier & Frank proposed an 11-story parking garage on the block, which the city denied after a series of heated public hearings. This proposal helped prompt the downtown business community and the city to undertake a comprehensive downtown planning program. The lot became Pioneer Courthouse Square in 1984.\nMeier & Frank's first branch store, with , opened in Salem, Oregon, under the direction and management of Aaron Frank's son Gerry Frank (1923-) in 1955. It had store-side parking for 1,000 cars. Five years later Meier & Frank opened Oregon's second-largest department store (exceeded only by its own downtown store) in Northeast Portland in the new Lloyd Center, at the time the world's largest shopping center. The crown prince of Japan (later Emperor Akihito) joined the dignitaries attending the opening festivities.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1966, a bitter intra-family battle erupted as stockholders considered two potential buyout offers for the store—one, supported by Aaron Frank, to sell to Carter Hawley Hale Stores for cash, and the other, supported by Jack Meier (Julius Meier's son) (1912–1988), to sell to May Department Stores for stock. Members of the Meier, Frank, and Hirsch families owned most company stock. After a lengthy and acrimonious struggle, the families eventually chose to sell to May in 1966 and Jack Meier became the store's president. Aaron Frank retired, and Gerry Frank became chief of staff to newly elected U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield, eventually earning the nickname \"Oregon’s Third Senator\".\n\nFrom 1969 to 2004, Meier & Frank opened stores in Eugene (1969), Washington Square in Progress (now part of Tigard) (1973), Vancouver, Washington (1977), Clackamas Town Center just outside Portland (1980 and 2002), Medford (1986), and Tanasbourne in Hillsboro (2004).\n\nFor 1990, the company recorded net retail sales of $284 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and its figure for average sales per square foot was $149. Measuring by store units, Meier & Frank was roughly four times smaller than its closest rival within the May Department Stores family, but its average sales per square foot was the third-highest, an enviable $225 per square foot during the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2001, May rebranded its Utah-based ZCMI stores (Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution) with the Meier & Frank name. A year later Meier & Frank's operations merged with the Robinsons-May division in Los Angeles, while retaining its name. In 2005 Federated Department Stores, the parent company of Macy's, purchased May Department Stores and announced that the store (and many other venerable department store names owned by Federated) would be renamed \"Macy’s\". In 2001, Federated assumed the name of its largest division to become Macy's, Inc. At the close of business on September 8, 2006, use of the name Meier & Frank was officially discontinued, all remaining stores becoming Macy's the following day.\n\nMeier & Frank also operated several restaurants in or near its stores, all of which have now been closed. The square footage that in-store restaurants required was more profitably used to sell or store merchandise. By the late 1990s, competing against the increasing number of dining options and against mall and food court marketing efforts did not make financial sense.\n\n\n\n"}

He released four full-length albums as a solo artist (Extended Engagement 2003, Simmer 2004, A Place Where We Belong 2011 and In Case We're All Still Here 2013). As a DJ, he has toured the world many times over, between 2008 and 2014 he hosted and produced the weekly radio show/podcast Glam Scum International, and in 2015 he launched a new series of club nights named M.B.T.S.(Most Below The Surface)\n\nJesse Houk was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to an American father and a Dutch mother. After finishing college, his dual citizenship allowed him to move to New York City in 1997 where he started producing music under his new alias The Scumfrog. Between 1997 and 2000 he lived between New York City—where he DJ’d Deep House and Tech House in NY’s East Village lounges such as the Opium Den – and the Netherlands where he worked with his production partner Jacques Sperwer. Jacques and Jesse released several singles under various names such as Jake & Jesse, Barbarus and a full-length album on BMG Bertelsmann Music Group under the name Resonance. In this period he also recorded his first work under the Scumfrog alias, called The Watersong, which was selected by Danny Tenaglia -- DJ Magazine’s number 1 DJ in the world at the time -- for his Global Underground Athens compilation.\n\nAfter the underground buzz of The Watersong, The Scumfrog signed an album deal with Roger Sanchez, who also took him as his opening DJ on his 2001 tour. That summer, The Scumfrog single “We Love You” (based on the Beatles/Rolling Stones collaboration) went to number one in most European dance charts and put the Scumfrog name on the map.\n\nThe Scumfrog career has largely been marked by an ability to work with mainstream artists without sacrificing his underground sound. Between 2001 and 2007, The Scumfrog scored more than 10 number 1 Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play records remixing mainstream artists like Britney Spears, Enrique Iglesias, Annie Lennox, Jewel, J-pop superstar Utada Hikaru but rarely ever making full vocal remixes of the artists he worked with. His EMI collaboration with David Bowie, remixing his 1984 single “Loving the Alien,” set the tone for a career that would thrive simultaneously in underground clubs and in mainstream recording studios. While on duty for the stars, he never stopped remixing for respected underground Dance Music labels such as Positiva, Intec, Yoshitoshi Recordings, Bedrock Records and Strictly Rhythm, doing remixes for his DJ peers such as Steve Lawler, Planet Funk, Boris Dlugosh, and Dirty Vegas.\n\nHis first album ‘Extended Engagement’ (2003, EMI/Positiva/Effin) was a two disc mix compilation exclusively of his own productions and remixes, including his own singles We Love You, Music Revolution, and Learning To Fly.\n\nJesse released more radio-friendly records under the alias Dutch, getting his first number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2003, \"My Time\" which he co-wrote with vocalist Crystal Waters. The follow-up to \"My Time\" was the single \"Why Should I Think About The Rain\", featuring Grammy winning singer/songwriter and Rolling Stones back-up singer Lisa Fischer.\n\nIn 2004, The Scumfrog won the International Dance Music Award (IDMA) for 'Best Remixer' of 2003.\n\nHis second album ‘Simmer’ (2004, Effin) was the first album where Jesse himself wrote all the songs (no remixes of other artists). It featured the singles ‘Music Revolution’, ‘Simmer’, ‘Come On’, and a duet ‘Bacon’ with his longtime friend, singer Lucy Woodward. Simmer did not have a huge impact, largely because it was marketed and promoted solely by The Scumfrog’s own label, and because the songs on the album were not nearly as DJ-friendly as his previous work.\n\nIn 2005, The Scumfrog’s most successful single ‘Music Revolution’ was chosen for Chevrolet’s long running Chevrolet HHR commercial on TV and radio. In the same year, Jesse formed the band ‘DJs Are Alive’with fellow DJ/performers DJ Skribble, D:Fuse, Static Revenger and Kristine W. The band’s mission was to sound like a DJ set and look like a band. DJs Are Alive performed a series of shows in 2006, but disbanded allegedly due to continuing scheduling conflicts with their gigs as individual DJs.\n\nIn 2006, the Scumfrog released another mix compilation ‘Mega Scum 1’, which quickly became an industry sensation because of its artwork; Jesse himself posing in a bikini on the cover in an attempt to parody the culture of hot girls on the cover of Dance Music compilations.\n\nDuring this period nearly all of The Scumfrog's artist releases were on Effin Records, his own label with manager/partner Steve Rosen, and although the label never attained massive commercial success it proved to a valuable laboratory for the work that was to come.\n\nUpon his return to the US after a long European tour in 2007, Jesse decided to trade his New York City home for the desert and mountains of New Mexico where he lived until 2015.\n\nOne of the biggest successes of his career came in the form of an unreleased Scumfrog remix of Peter Bjorn & John ‘The Young Folks’, which went viral during the summer of 2007, and in its unreleased bootleg form made it to the playlists of many mainstream radio stations. At the same time, his collaboration with Italian DJ/Producer Tommy Vee in covering Steve Miller Band’s 70s hit ‘Serenade’ also made it into many European pop-charts.\n\nIn 2008, the Scumfrog started a weekly hour-long radio show ‘Glam Scum’ on Sirius Satellite Radio in the US. A year later, after a merger between Sirius and Satellite radio company XM, the show was dropped, and the show was re-launched as ‘Glam Scum International’ and licensed to several radio stations around the world. The episodes can also be streamed and downloaded as a podcast from the show’s website or from iTunes.\n\nDuring 2007, The Scumfrog had been writing and recording with Cyndi Lauper in New York on her Dance Music album ‘Bring Ya To The Brink’. Their song ‘High and Mighty’ became the opening track of the album, which was released in 2008 and nominated for a Grammy in the category ‘Best Dance Album’ in 2009. (The album lost the Grammy that year to fellow nominees Daft Punk.)\n\nIn 2011, The Scumfrog reunited with his underground roots in the custom-made DJ set \"A Place Where We Belong\". Similarly to his debut album ‘Extended Engagement’, the mix consists of 12 original productions (some his own, some remixes of other artists). Jesse himself announced that he did not want to call it an album because ‘DJs are not supposed to make albums, DJs are supposed to make DJ mixes’. The new material was offered in a non-stop DJ mix on his Facebook page where – in a video – Jesse explained his voluntary donation system for his new music. Many of the songs on ‘A Place Where We Belong’ were licensed to labels for single-release. ‘In Love’ was released on Umek’s label 1605, ‘Illusion’ came out on Floorplay, ‘Running’ on Inkfish, and ‘Don’t Give Up featuring Vassy (singer)’ (a cover of Peter Gabriel & Kate Bush) on Armada.\n\nArmada Music released The Scumfrog's fourth full-length album \"In Case We're All Still Here\" in 2013, which features his collaboration with Sting (musician). The two teamed up to remake Sting’s 1993 hit If I Ever Lose My Faith in You.\n\nIn 2015, he released the single Send Wave on Hot Since 82 label Knee Deep In Sound.\n\nAs a DJ, The Scumfrog has toured the world many times over. Even though he has played many festivals over the past ten years (Burning Man being his favorite), he makes it very clear that he prefers smaller venues with great sound systems for the music that he plays. In 2015 he started a new brand of small-room underground clubbing named M.B.T.S.(Most Below The Surface)\n\nJesse Houk currently lives in Barcelona, Spain\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While MTV department is often grouped with that of Nickelodeon's, the two entities are completely separate. Most of MTV's cartoons are known for their dark humor, sexual jokes, graphic violence, pop culture references, and irreverence.\n\nIn an interview for the \"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America\" DVD, Mike Judge described MTV Animation as being very ad hoc: \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" didn't have an art director until the film was made, so until the film they'd never considered colour palettes from scene to scene. In the same interview, art director Yvette Kaplan said \"everything was overlapping... we never had the luxury of one part [episode] finished\" before another episode was finished.\n\nMany MTV animation productions do not survive a single season and in some cases are canceled before completion. Productions including \"Undergrads\", \"Downtown\", \"Station Zero\", and \"Clone High\" have been highly acclaimed, yet none of them got renewed beyond their first season, usually due to lack of an audience or advertising. By 2001, the animation department was shut down, with the network's animated series now being outsourced to different studios. During the 2000s, MTV would phase out of producing original animation in favor of importing shows, usually reruns of shows from sister networks Comedy Central and Nickelodeon. \n\nIn 2011, MTV would return to adult animation. Its first production was a relaunch of \"Beavis and Butt-head\", which premiered in October 2011; this was quickly followed by \"Good Vibes\", starting later in the same month. In November 2011, MTV said they plan a third cartoon, \"Worst Friends Forever\" by Thomas Middleditch, that Mike Judge would produce, about three teenage girls who hover on the outskirts of popularity and have to cope with cattiness and crushes; a pilot had been picked up and concept art of the characters was released. The cartoons did not do as expected though. \"Good Vibes\" was cancelled in February 2012 due to low ratings, on the same day the DVD came out, \"Beavis and Butt-head\" was cancelled in December 2011, and \"Worst Friends Forever\" never aired. In a September 2012 interview on \"Making It With Riki Lindhome\", Middleditch said \"Worst Friends\" was \"for all intents and purposes done\" and \"not in my hands anymore\". Mike Judge said in January 2014 that he might pitch \"Beavis and Butt-head\" to another network.\n"}
{"id": "2331607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331607", "title": "Community of Sant'Egidio", "text": "Community of Sant'Egidio\n\nThe Community of Sant'Egidio () is a lay Catholic association dedicated to social service, founded in 1968 under the leadership of Andrea Riccardi. The group grew and in 1973 was given a home at the former Carmelite monastery and church of Sant'Egidio in Rome, Italy. In 1986 it received recognition from the Roman Curia of the Holy See as an international association of the faithful. Its activities include the Church's evening prayer together daily as a stimulus for lending assistance to a whole spectrum of needy persons: \"lonely and non-self-sufficient elderly, immigrants and homeless people, terminally ill and HIV/AIDS patients, children at risk of deviance and marginalization, nomads and the physically and mentally handicapped, drug addicts, victims of war, and prisoners.\" The community also has a high profile in the area of peace negotiations, in addressing the AIDS epidemic in Africa, and in its opposition to capital punishment. It takes an ecumenical approach in all of its work. \n\nSant'Egidio is a network of small communities of fraternal life, currently present in 73 countries distributed as follows: Europe (23), Africa (29), Asia (7), North America (8), South America (5). There are an estimated 50,000 members.\n\nIn 1968, just after the Second Vatican Council, Andrea Riccardi while still a teenager drew together a group of students at Virgil High School in Rome, and founded the Christian community of the Acts of the Apostles and Francis of Assisi. The students took to teaching poor children who lived in shacks in the Roman periphery. Then the \"Popular School\" was formed, now called the \"School of Peace\" and present in many countries of the world.\n\nIn 1973 the group acquired its present headquarters at the former Carmelite convent and church of Sant'Egidio (Italian for Saint Giles) in Trastevere in Rome. From 1977 the Community of Sant'Egidio expanded to other Italian cities and in the 1980s it spread to Europe, Africa, America, and Asia. On May 18, 1986, the Pontifical Council for the Laity named the Community of Sant'Egidio as \"an international association of the faithful of pontifical right\". \n\nIn the Community of the nineties, the \"Country of the Rainbow\" was born, a movement for children and young people to learn respect for others and for nature. It can lead to lifetime commitment in the Community. Also, the 1989 murder of a South African refugee was the stimulus for the \"People of Peace\" initiative directed primarily toward migrants but including the poor and elderly in some of its programs.\n\nPope Francis' closeness to the community was demonstrated when in July 2019 he appointed Mateo Bruni, a prominent member of the Sant' Egidio community, as Director of the Press Office of the Holy See. In October of the same year he raised to the Cardinalate Archbishop Matteo Zuppi of Bologna, a key member of the community in peace negotiations during the Mozambican Civil War.\n\nThe Community has no initiation ceremony or clear definition of membership. There are no salaried positions for San'Egidio officers and all have outside jobs. Groups are held together by shared evening prayer and commitment to serve the poor. The number of those belonging to Sant'Egidio can only be estimated. The Pontifical Council for the Laity in its Compendium of International Movements estimated a membership of 50,000 in 2006.\n\nEvery four years, an election council consisting of about 40 representatives elects the president and a council as a guiding organ. In 2003 Marco Impagliazzo was named president of the Community, and remained in office through 2019. There is also a spiritual general assistant.\n\n\nThe National President and the Council of Presidency are elected every five years by the General Assembly of representatives of all nuclei of communities (if there are several communities in a country).\n\nThe basis of its communal life is common evening prayer, which is open and may take place in a central church. At every service a Bible passage is interpreted as a stimulus for closer following of Jesus through forming friendships with the poor and working for peace among all peoples. The Community's effectiveness in working with people has been attributed to its \"spirit of compromise and encounter\", which has been compared to that of Pope Francis who has raised its profile during his pontificate. Francis, during a visit to the community in Rome on June 14, 2014, characterized the Community of Sant'Egidio with three Ps: preghiera, poveri, pace (prayer, poor, peace). On the occasion of its 50th anniversary celebrations Francis again visited the community and remarked that it was a daughter of the Second Vatican Council, with its impulse to community life and to being The People of God. He also commended the community for its audacious love:Audaciousness is not the courage of a day, it is the patience of a daily mission in the city and in the world, a mission to patiently weave together again the human fabric of the peripheries that violence and impoverishment have torn apart; a mission to communicate the Gospel through personal friendship; to show how life truly becomes human when it is lived beside the poor; a mission to create a society that considers no one a foreigner. It is the mission to cross borders and walls, to join together.The Community, then, consists of small groups whose prayer together leads them outward to the poor and needy with whom they cultivate Christlike friendships. \"Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey commented that the Community of Sant’Egidio is what we want the modern church to be.\"\nSocial commitment, especially through personal relationships, is what the Community of Sant'Egidio calls \"friendship with the poor\". Riccardi has described this friendship as so close that \"I can't say that there is really a radical difference between members and non-members.\" Sant'Egidio has been described as a realization of Pope Francis' dream for the church to be \"a field hospital\" with Catholics \"like shepherds living with the smell of their sheep\". This includes the following.\n\nIn \"Schools of Peace\" values of humanity, peace, and coexistence on the basis of the Christian faith are taught, along with school promotion (e.g. homework support), common games, and excursions. \"Country of the Rainbow\" educates children to solidarity with all peoples and with nature. By 2019 it had grown to include about 10,000 children and young adults worldwide.\n\n\"Long Live the Elderly\" is an outreach program to the elderly, in response to their isolation. The priority objective is prevention, fighting the negative effects of critical events (like heat waves, flu epidemics, falls, loss of cohabitant). Members of the Community establish long-term relationships with the lonely poor in rest homes, and find that \"prayer and friendship with the poor is a beautiful way to live God’s love and mercy in our daily life.”\n\nCommunity members serve meals to the poor. Worship and commemoration events are designed to strengthen ties to people suffering from homelessness and poverty. The Vatican may go to the Community when requests for food are made, as by North Korea.\n\nThe community in Rome prints a 253-page handbook titled \"Where to Eat, Sleep, and Wash in Rome\" as a gift for the homeless. The book lists places where service is offered for the estimated 7,500 people living on the streets or in makeshift shacks of Rome, including everything from 47 overnight shelters to the 11 language schools for migrants run by Sabnt'Egidio itself. Another of its works is with about 140,000 gypsies in Italy, as publicized by the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People.\n\nThe \"Language and Culture School\" offers free language courses and an introduction to the culture of the host country in various European countries. Refugees and new citizens launched the \"People of Peace\" movement in 1999 in various European countries with the aim of promoting integration, encounter of cultures and religions, exchange, and peace work in the respective countries. In 2016, in collaboration with the Italian Protestant churches, an agreement was signed with the Italian Government to set up the \"Humanitarian corridors\" project, whereby refugees from camps in Lebanon, Morocco, and Ethiopia can safely travel to Europe with humanitarian visas and avoid the dangerous trips across the sea. Pope Francis has turned to Sant'Egidio to house refugees brought to Italy by the Vatican.\n\nThis offers spiritual exchange, religious education, and leisure activities for adults with disabilities, and reaches out to lepers. \"The Friends\" movement is a Community-sponsored restaurant that supports the DREAM program for AIDS sufferers in Africa by selling disabled peoples' paintings from the Community's own workshop.\n\nSant'Egidio has been involved in numerous successful peace negotiations as a facilitator or observer: Albania (1987, elections), Mozambique (1989-1992, peace treaty), Algeria (1995, unify political groups), Guatemala (1996, mediate civil war), Kosovo (1996-1998, negotiate with Serbia), Congo (1999, national dialogue), Burundi (1997-2000, peace treaty). The Community's most significant diplomatic achievement was the mediation of the Peace Agreement for Mozambique on October 4, 1992, which ended a sixteen-year civil war. The Washington Post has described Sant'Egidio as \"one of the most influential conflict resolution groups in the world,\" and this is borne out by the accolades it has received from a wide range of leaders. In 2002 the Community gathered 450 religious leaders to discuss forming an International Parliament of Religions to mobilize morality.\n\nIn 2014 Sant'Egidio collaborated with the Islamic association Muhammadiyah of Indonesia to bring an end to a 40-year conflict in the Mindanao region of the Philippines. Troubled areas where it was involved in 2017 included Central African Republic, Senegal, South Sudan, and Libya. In June of that year the UN Department of Political Affairs formally opened a channel of communication with Sant'Egidio, as have individual countries. \n\nMembers of the Community of Sant'Egidio have been organizing annual \"International Peace Meetings\" since their first at Assisi in 1986: Lyon (France) 2005, United States in 2006, Barcelona in 2010, Munich in 2011, Sarajevo in 2012, Rome in 2013, Antwerp in 2014, Tirana in 2015, and Assisi again in 2016, on the 30th anniversary of the first meeting. In 2017 the meeting took place in Münster and Osnabrück, with the participation of Chancellor Angela Merkel. There is a strong element of ecumenism and dialogue at these \"annual meetings ... [that] bring together Muslims, Catholics, Jews, Christians of all faiths, humanists, non-believers.\" \n\nSant'Egidio has generated \"Youth for Peace\" groups, with some communicating through postings on websites. Members of the adult \"Peace People\" group support reception centers for foreigners and also reach out to the poor and elderly.\n\nSant'Egidio is \"among global leaders on HIV/AIDS.\" Its program DREAM (\"Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and Malnutrition\") is one of the most studied approaches to HIV / AIDs treatment in the world. with a reported 100 or so papers on the program. Many of these are peer-reviewed studies that attest to its efficacy.\n\nDREAM takes a holistic approach, combining highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with the treatment of malnutrition, tuberculosis, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases, while emphasizing health education at all levels. The program was initiated in Mozambique in March 2002 and has spread to Angola, Cameroon, Congo DRC, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Guinea and Swaziland; it works through dispersed health centers. Funding has come from various international organizations including the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as from Italy's wine growers. In 2004 Sant'Egidio received the Balzan Prize for humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples, \"and in particular for the realization of its DREAM program to fight AIDS and malnutrition that is taking place in Mozambique, a concrete model for others African countries in difficulty.\"\n\nSince 1998, the Community has been campaigning for a worldwide moratorium on the capital punishment. An appeal that was signed by more than 5 million people worldwide in 2007, in collaboration with the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty (WCADP), helped the United Nations General Assembly to pass by a large majority on December 18, 2007, a resolution which calls for a moratorium worldwide. Mario Marazziti, a member of the Community and of the lower house of parliament in Italy, head of its Human Rights Committee, published an English-language book entitled \"13 Ways of Looking at the Death Penalty\".\n\nEvery year since 2002, the Community of Sant'Egidio organizes the Global Day of Action \"Cities for Life / Cities Against the Death Penalty\" on 30th November, inviting cities around the world to take part in the Cities for Life Day. It also shows its commitment against the death penalty by furnishing pen pals for many death-row convicts and by collecting signatures for a moratorium on executions.\n\nIn 2003 the Italian journalist Sandro Magister wrote that working groups within Sant'Egidio, along with the poor, can displace the birth family for some Community members (Mt 10:35). He also printed a former member's memoir of having to defend one's behavior or beliefs before executive members.\n\nThe Community of Sant'Egidio and its leaders have received numerous honors. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Warner was Vice President of FIFA and President of CONCACAF until his suspension and eventual resignation from these roles in 2011. He is also the former Minister of National Security of Trinidad and Tobago and was an elected member of the country's parliament from 2007 to 2015. A former history teacher, he is the owner of Joe Public F.C., a professional football club in Tunapuna, Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nWarner had been a member of the FIFA Executive Committee since 1983 and CONCACAF President since 1990. He was re-elected for a new term in 2011. Warner was implicated in numerous corruption allegations dating back to the 1980s. On 29 May 2011, Warner and Mohammed bin Hammam were provisionally suspended by the FIFA Ethics Committee pending the outcome of the investigation of corruption allegations against them. On 20 June 2011, FIFA announced Warner's resignation from all his positions in international football.\n\nOn 18 April 2013, The Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) published its Integrity Committee report into Warner, concluding that he had committed fraud against CONCACAF and FIFA. In 2015, Warner (along with several other FIFA officials who were arrested in Zurich before the annual FIFA Congress) was charged in the United States with \"wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.\" Warner is facing extradition to the United States for criminal prosecution. On 29 September 2015, the adjudicatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, chaired by Hans-Joachim Eckert, decided to ban him from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level for life.\n\nAustin \"Jack\" Warner was born in Rio Claro, south Trinidad, on 26 January 1943. He is one of three brothers and three sisters who were brought up almost single-handedly by their mother Stella. After gaining a scholarship from Trinidad Clay Products, he attended the College of St Phillip's and St James, which in 1958 became Presentation College, Chaguanas. After attending Teachers Training College, he then graduated with a BA degree from the University of the West Indies at St Augustine, and subsequently earned a Diploma in International Relations from the same institution.\n\nIn 1971, Warner became a teacher at North Eastern College, and was also at this time until 1973 a part-time sociology lecturer at UWI. From 1972 until 1993, he was a lecturer in history at the Polytechnic Institute.\n\nIn 1966, Warner became General Secretary of the Central Football Association, and from 1971 to 1973 was General Secretary of the Central St. George Football Association.\n\nWarner became the secretary of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation (TTFF) in 1973. In 1990, he was elected President of the Caribbean Football Union, resigning his post at TTFF but was immediately appointed a special advisor, a position that he still holds.\n\nIn 1983, Warner became a CONCACAF Vice-President and also joined the FIFA Executive Committee. Warner was elected CONCACAF President in 1990, unseating Joaquín Soria Terrazas who had held the seat for twenty years. Warner and the new CONCACAF General Secretary, Chuck Blazer, took over an organization with US$140,000 in annual revenue. Warner was appointed as a FIFA Vice-President in 1997. In 2010, Warner stated his intent to stand for re-election in 2011.\nJack Warner is the chairman of the Joe Public Football Club which he founded in 1996, in the aftermath of Trinidad and Tobago's failed World Cup qualifying campaign. Warner also helped to found Trinidad and Tobago's Professional Football League (PFL), then the first professional football league in the Caribbean, which has since been superseded by the TT Pro League.\n\nIn 1998, Warner purchased the Scarlet Ibis Hotel in St Augustine for TT$6 million, which he renovated and renamed the Emerald Apartments and Plaza. Run by Warner's son Daryl, the Emerald Apartments and Plaza sponsor local football competitions, including the 2010 Eastern Football Association Emerald Apartments & Plaza Cup. Warner also owns Kantac Plaza in Arouca, which was used as the base for Trinidad and Tobago's successful 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign. Warner had other real estate holdings in the twin island republic, including the offices used by TTFF and CONCACAF. CONCACAF pays Warner \"nearly a third of a million dollars a year\" rent. Warner also claims business interests in Costa Rica and the United States. Warner states that his investments were funded from \"the salary and allowances I received from FIFA\".\n\nBefore the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Warner, as special advisor to TTFF, brokered a deal between the Federation and the players on Trinidad and Tobago's 2006 World Cup team to share the proceeds from their participation in the World Cup. After the tournament, the Federation declared revenue of TT$18.25 million, costs of TT$17.9 million and offered the players a split of TT$5,644.08 per player. The players rejected this figure, disputing the Federation's numbers. Warner criticized the players for refusing to accept the TTFF's unaudited statement, saying \"What Trinidad is suffering from is from a situation whereby 16 or 18 players are holding a country and a federation to ransom because of greed.\" Shaka Hislop, the interim president of the Football Players Association of Trinidad and Tobago, responded with a letter to Warner writing \"You have continually proven yourself heavily biased and opinionated in this matter.\" In 2010, Hislop added that \"Jack Warner, though not on the TTFA officially, makes every single decision: how much bonus should be paid, who is the right coach.\"\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago government revealed that the Federation received in excess of TT$173 million for their part in the tournament in Germany. TTFF proposed that the bonus dispute be heard before the UK Sports Dispute Resolution Panel, which the players agreed to. Arbitrator Ian Mill QC heard the case and ruled that Warner had \"the authority of the TTFA to commit it to financial transactions\" and that the players were entitled to 50 per cent of the FIFA World Cup participation money and the commercial revenues gained from Trinidad and Tobago's qualification, as well as half the net income from World Cup warm-up matches. The players' lawyer, Michael Townley, said, \"At the moment, the players have not received a single cent\" and alleged that the TTFF defaulted on its payment to the arbitration body.\n\nWarner once again caused controversy in 2007 in an interview with the BBC about England's chances of holding the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He asserted that \"\"England invented the sport but has never made any impact on world football\"\" despite being one of only (then) seven nations to ever lift the world cup, \"\"For Europe, England is an irritant\"\", and that \"\"Nobody in Europe likes England\"\". Furthermore, Warner proposed that, if the World Cup were to be held in Europe, it should be held in Italy, Spain or France (countries that last hosted the competition in 1990, 1982 and 1998, respectively). He said that he would \"battle to bring...the tournament to his region.\"\n\nHowever, on 14 February 2008, Warner retracted this stance. England's Football Association agreed to visit Trinidad and Tobago to play a friendly against the Trinidad and Tobago national football team on the condition that Warner apologize.\n\nWarner argued that, \"The time has come. The fact is they invented this sport [...] They last held the World Cup 42 years ago. That is almost two to three generations. There are guys in England who have never seen a World Cup on English soil.\" Warner maintained that the choice of England would not be popular among mainland Europe though.\n\nDuring the bidding process to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup's Warner continually supported the English bid, promising to vote in England's favour at the draw in December 2010. Warner approached the England bid team through David Beckham, offering to hold off on bringing out the vote for Russia in exchange for promises in relation to CONCACAF. Russia won the vote to hold the FIFA World Cup in 2018, with Warner widely reported to have voted for the Russian bid.\n\nIn September 2008, after Sunderland player Dwight Yorke had withdrawn from the Trinidad and Tobago national football team, Warner attacked the club and the manager, Roy Keane. In a letter leaked to the press, Warner accused Keane of disrespecting \"small countries\" and having a \"mean streak\". Keane responded by denying the allegation, accusing Warner of being a \"clown\" and a \"disgrace\", and insisted that Yorke was retired from international football.\n\nWarner unilaterally withdrew CONCACAF's support of the football events at the Mayagüez 2010 games at the last moment stating that the tournament facilities allegedly do not meet the \"minimum standards required to conduct an international tournament.\" He threatened to sanction countries that participated. Some of the possible sanctions were the teams accreditation by CONCACAF and ending economic helps.\n\nWarner has been accused of corruption for repeatedly taking advantage of his position for financial gain.\n\nVia a private family company, Warner owned shares in Simpaul, a travel and holiday company. In late 2002, various global media publications alleged that Warner had made a profit of US$350,000 selling 2002 FIFA World Cup tickets. In a series of exposés during December 2005, the \"Trinidad and Tobago Express\" revealed that Simpaul was offering $30,000 packages to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, which effectively marked up match tickets at a high rate. FIFA's ethics committee criticised the ticket deals, concluding Warner had abused his position to obtain personal benefits and failed to declare his business interests. Warner agreed to sever all family links with Simpaul immediately. However, his son Daryan remained a director of Simpaul throughout World Cup 2006, while his personal assistant remained the company secretary of Simpaul.\n\nFIFA started an investigation and asked their auditors Ernst & Young, to investigate. In a report submitted to FIFA in March 2006, E&Y estimated that Warner's family had made a profit of at least $1 million from reselling 2006 World Cup tickets, that Warner had directly ordered or sold on behalf of the TTFA. Minutes of FIFA's executive committee indicate that in consequence of being found guilty of breaking FIFA's Article 5, a fine of almost $1 million, equal to the expected profiteering, was imposed on the family. Despite numerous reminders from FIFA, only $250,000 has been paid. Andrew Jennings, the presenter of \"FIFA's Dirty Secrets\", an edition of BBC's \"Panorama,\" repeated the allegations in a November 2010 programme during the week Warner and his fellow FIFA Executive Committee members voted to decide the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\n\nScottish Football Association President John McBeth said Warner asked that monies owed to the TTFF be sent to Warner's personal account. According to McBeth, after Trinidad and Tobago visited Scotland for a friendly match at Easter Road, Edinburgh, on 30 May 2004, Warner asked that the cheque for the game be made out to him. McBeth told Warner, \"we don't do that\" and noted that Warner also approached other members of the Scottish FA following the game in an attempt to collect money due to the TTFF.\n\nOn 10 May 2011, former chairman of the English Football Association, Lord Triesman, accused Warner and several others of asking for compensation in return for votes for England's 2018 World Cup bid. Warner reportedly asked for £2.5 million that would go toward building an education centre in Trinidad. Sir Dave Richards, the chairman of the Premier League, who was present at the meeting, confirmed that the intention of cash for votes was implied, although it was not explicitly stated. However, Warner described the allegations as \"a piece of nonsense\".\n\nOn 26 May 2011 the BBC published an email from Warner to the English FA requesting funds to purchase Haiti's World Cup television rights. The above article also quotes FIFA as denying that Haiti had ever been granted television rights for this competition. This email appears to substantiate a separate charge by Lord Triesman (formally heading the England 2018 World Cup bid) whereby Warner had requested funds from the English to (again) be sent into his personal account so that he could purchase the rights as a humanitarian gesture for the Haitian people. In return, the English bid team could expect his support during the bid process. The total sum that Warner had requested in this instance was in the region of $1.6 million.\n\nIn December 2011 Warner claimed to have purchased the television rights for the 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 editions of the FIFA World Cup for Trinidad & Tobago, via a Mexican company. Warner claimed to have purchased the rights for the 1998 FIFA World Cup for one dollar. Warner also claimed that he refused to endorse Sepp Blatter in the 2011 FIFA Presidential election despite being offered the rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, again for a nominal fee. Warner further alleged that he was offered other \"inducements\" to develop football in the Caribbean. Warner claims he used the revenue from selling on the rights to develop football in the Caribbean.\n\nIn February 2012 the TTFF claimed that funds for Haiti donated following the 2010 earthquake were paid into a bank account controlled by Warner. FIFA subsequently froze funding to the TTFF until it received an explanation. FIFA is also withholding Warner's pension. Warner later suggested that the allegations were a conspiracy, saying that \"I have nothing to answer to anybody. Who wants to make allegations, make allegations. Ask yourselves, as objective members of the media: 'Why now...?' And after you get why now, just join the dots and see.\"\n\nOn 19 April 2013, the CONCACAF Integrity Committee, headed by David Simmons, former Chief Justice of Barbados, issued a report accusing Warner and his former cohort Chuck Blazer of mismanagement and massive fraud. Warner is alleged to have concealed his ownership of the land on which CONCACAF's $25 million Joao Havelange Center of Excellence was built, which made him the effective owner of the building. Warner's initial public reaction was defiant: \"As far as I am aware it is baseless and malicious. I left CONCACAF and turned my back on football two years ago. Since then I have had no interest in any football-related matter.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Warner was indicted by the United States Department of Justice and an arrest warrant issued for him and other FIFA officials. Warner and the others were accused of \"wire fraud, racketeering and money laundering\".\n\nWarner handed himself into Trinidad police in May and was bailed pending extradition to the United States.\nThe following week, he said publicly that he had documents linking the outcome of the 2010 Trinidad and Tobago general election with FIFA finances and himself.\nWarner made the claims in a paid national television political broadcast, saying that his life was in danger, that he had given the documents to lawyers, and, \"I will no longer keep secrets for them who actively seek to destroy the country.\"\n\nAfter the US formally requested Warner's extradition in July 2015, he appealed against the procedure, represented by a strong legal team. After more than two years of deliberation, on 28 September 2017 High Court judge James Aboud ruled against the suit, allowing the extradition process to proceed, while granting Warner and his legal team 28 days to appeal the decision. On 2 November 2017 Warner's attorneys filed an appeal. On 2 March 2018, Justice of Appeal Mark Mohammed granted Warner an appeal of Aboud's ruling, to be heard in November 2018—effectively postponing any possible extradition until some time after the hearing.\n\nIn mid-June 2019 a three judge Appeal Court dismissed Warner's claim that the order against him contravened Trinidad and Tobago's Extradition Act. However, the Court has granted him a 21-day stay before extradition can proceed, for a direct appeal to the Privy Council of the nation.\n\nIn July of that year, a United States court entered a default judgement against Warner in a civil lawsuit filed by CONCACAF when Warner failed to appear, ordering Warner to repay US$79 million that he had fraudulently obtained from CONCACAF.\n\nIn April of 2020, additional information was revealed in an unsealed indictment, alleging that Warner had \"received $5 million in more than two dozen separate wire transfers to vote for Russia to host the 2018 soccer championship. The wire transfers were sent from 10 different shell companies in Cyprus, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands and then cleared through correspondent U.S. bank accounts.\"\n\nIn October 2007, Warner was elected United National Congress Alliance chairman and co-leader, to lead the party into Trinidad and Tobago's 2007 General Election. They won 15 of 41 seats, and Warner was elected as the Member of Parliament for Chaguanas West. Patrick Manning's PNM government, which had comfortably won the 2007 election, called an election less than three years into its mandate. Warner's UNC party formed a coalition with four other parties and won 24 May 2010 elections by a landslide margin of 29 of 41 seats in parliament. Warner was re-elected in Chaguanas West with the highest national vote total. He has described the previous Trinidadian administration as the \"most corrupt ever\" and has pledged to enforce hanging as a method of execution. Warner has said, \"It is inconceivable to have 295 on death row awaiting the hangman...when no one is trying to apply the law.\"\n\nAfter the 2010 election, Warner was appointed the Works and Transport Minister in Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar's government. Opposition leader Keith Rowley wrote to the Integrity Commission questioning Warner's ability to be a FIFA Vice President, while also the Trinidad and Tobago Works and Transport Minister. Government counsel concluded that Warner was not breaking any laws, Attorney General Anand Ramlogan said that Warner did not receive a salary from FIFA, Trinidad benefited from Warner's appointment, and his two positions were unlikely to conflict.\n\nAlthough Warner was allowed to withdraw from football-related activities by FIFA with a presumption of innocence in the CFU scandal of 2011, a videotape played during FIFA's disciplinary process was consequently made public. Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar referred the videotape to the Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago without endorsing or condemning Warner. Warner resigned as Minister of National Security on 21 April 2013 and was replaced by Emmanuel George. Warner resigned as Chairman of the United National Congress on 22 April 2013, and resigned as Member of Parliament for Chaguanas West four days later, triggering a by-election in his constituency. Warner subsequently formed a new political party, the Independent Liberal Party (ILP), and won the by-election for Chaguanas West on 29 July.\n\nWarner contested Trinidad and Tobago's 2015 General Election held on 7 September 2015 in the Chaguanas East seat. Warner received 771 votes (4.30%) and failed to win the seat in the election.\n\nAfter a long-running political feud, Surujrattan Rambachan sued Warner for defamation. In July 2016, Warner agreed to pay TT$375,000 as final settlement.\n\n"}
{"id": "2331620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331620", "title": "Atmospheric vacuum breaker", "text": "Atmospheric vacuum breaker\n\nAn Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB) is a backflow prevention device used in plumbing to prevent backflow of non-potable liquids into the drinking water system. It is usually constructed of brass and resembles a 90-degree elbow with a hood on its top to allow air to enter the water system if a siphon attempts to form. Inside this elbow is a poppet valve that is held \"up\" by the water pressure found in the system, closing the air entrance to the device. If the pressure in the \"upstream side\" is reduced to atmospheric pressure or below, the poppet valve drops and allows air to enter the system, breaking the siphon.\n\nThese devices, since they work on atmospheric principles, cannot be installed in an enclosure containing air contaminants. Those contaminants could be drawn into the device, thus fouling the pipes. AVBs must be installed a minimum of 6 inches above the highest usage point in the system (i.e. sprinkler, drip emitter, etc.) Underground installation of AVBs is \"entirely ineffectual\" in providing backflow protection as groundwater in the underground vault could be drawn into the water system, contaminating it.\n\nThe AVB can be used in high hazard situations but not with continuous pressure, as the poppet would likely stick and the AVB would no longer function properly. A shutoff valve should never be placed downstream of any AVB, as this would result in continuous pressure on the AVB. The AVB is not a testable device.\n\n"}

Godfrey and Matilda had only one child, Beatrice, who was born in 1071 and died the same year. From 1071 on, Godfrey lived apart from his wife. The two spouses were on opposite sides in the Investiture Controversy: Matilda was a partisan of Pope Gregory VII and Godfrey of Emperor Henry IV.\n\nHe warred on Henry's behalf against Magnus, Duke of Saxony, in 1075 and on that of the bishop of Utrecht in 1076 against Dirk V of Holland and Robert I of Flanders.

It was the first of a series of battles that took place following an invasion of Wessex by the Danish army in December 870.\n\nBy 870, the Vikings had conquered two of the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Northumbria and East Anglia. At the end of 870 they launched an attempt to conquer Wessex and marched from East Anglia to Reading, arriving on about 28 December. Three days later they sent out a large party under two earls to forage and reconnoitre, and it was met at Englefield by an army of local levies under the command of Æthelwulf, Ealdorman of Berkshire. After one of the earls was killed and a large part of the Danish army was overthrown, the Viking force broke and ran.\n\nThe victory was short lived. Four days later, the main West Saxon army, led by King Ethelred and his brother, the future King Alfred the Great attacked the main Danish encampment at Reading and were bloodily repulsed in the Battle of Reading. Among the many dead of both sides was Æthelwulf. Further battles followed, including the Battle of Ashdown, a West Saxon victory, and the Battle of Meretun, when the Danes prevailed. Soon after Easter, which fell on 15 April in that year, Æthelred died and was succeeded by Alfred.\n\nThe Battle of Englefield can be dated because Bishop Heahmund of Sherborne died in the Battle of Meretun, and it is known that he died on 22 March 871. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that the Battle of Basing was two months earlier, dating it to 22 January, Ashdown fourteen days before that on 8 January, Reading four days earlier on 4 January, Englefield another four days earlier on 31 December 870, and the arrival of the Vikings in Reading three days earlier on 28 December. However, as the two month interval between Meretun and Basing is probably not exact, the earlier dates are approximate.\n"}

Placed in reserve following the war, \"Charette\" was transferred to the Kingdom of Greece in 1959 and renamed \"Velos\" (D16). \"Velos\" remained in service until 1991 and was then turned into a museum ship at Palaio Faliro, Athens.\n\n\"Charrette\" was launched on 3 June 1942 by the Boston Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. G.

On 26 November, \"Charrette\" joined the screen of the task group assigned to air-cover operations over Makin and Tarawa themselves, providing protection to the assault shipping and support for the Marines ashore. Twelve days later, the destroyer screened battleships in a pounding bombardment on Nauru, then rejoined the aircraft carriers sailing on to Efate. From this base \"Charrette\" sailed on 21 December to screen the carriers as they launched strikes against Kavieng, New Ireland, during the three days preceding the assault on Cape Gloucester 26 December. Continuing north, the group arrived at Funafuti 21 January 1944 to prepare for the operations against the Marshall Islands.\n\nFrom 23 January to 5 February 1944, \"Charrette\" screened the carriers in a series of strikes on Kwajalein and Eniwetok. On the night of 4–5 February, \"Charrette\" left her screening station to investigate a radar contact reported by one of the battleships. After tracking the contact to , she opened fire on the target, a submarine which dived at once. \"Charrette\" pressed home a depth charge attack, then used her radar to coach the destroyer escort in for the sinking of what was probably , the first Japanese submarine to be sunk by the Hedgehog (weapon) anti-submarine mortar. The next day, \"Charrette\" moored in the newly-won Majuro Lagoon.\n\nThe destroyer sailed 12 February 1944 for the first of the series of massive raids through which the great Japanese base at Truk was eventually sealed off from effective contribution to the Pacific war. After screening the carriers into position for their strikes, \"Charrette\" joined Task Group 50.9 (TG 50.9) in a sweep around the island on 17 February to catch Japanese shipping fleeing the air attacks on their base. , , and a submarine chaser were sent to the bottom by TG 50.9, which rejoined the carriers next day.\n\nAfter screening an oiler group to Majuro, \"Charrette\" sailed on for a brief overhaul at Pearl Harbor until 15 March 1944, when she put out to rejoin the carriers for attacks on Japanese ships which had retreated from Truk to the Palaus, a necessary preliminary to the New Guinea operation. A mighty force was assembled at Majuro for this bold thrust deep into Japanese-held waters, which sailed on 22 March. \"Charrette\" joined in beating off a Japanese air attack on 28 March, and continued her protective screening through the strikes of 30 March and 1 April. The carriers returned to Majuro 6 April, and sailed 7 days later to strike at airfields and defenses on New Guinea itself and to provide direct support to the landings at Humboldt Bay 22 April. After replenishing at Manus, \"Charrette\" sailed on with the carriers to screen strikes against Truk 29 April, and to guard the force's battleships as they pounded a bombardment at Ponape 1 May.\n\n\"Charrette\"s next contribution came in the lengthy Marianas operation, for which she sailed 6 June 1944. She supported the carriers in their strikes on Guam, Saipan, and Rota 11 through 14 June, then turned north for strikes against the aircraft massed on Iwo Jima for attacks against the American landings on Saipan. As the carriers came into position on 15 June, scouting aircraft spotted a 1,900-ton freighter, and \"Charrette\", with the destroyer sped to sink the Japanese ship, recovering 112 survivors. After successful strikes, \"Charrette\"s group wheeled south to concentrate with the Fast Carrier Task Force (then TF 58) to meet the Japanese naval force known to be coming out. The great air Battle of the Philippine Sea broke on the morning of 19 June, and \"Charrette\" continued her screening, antiaircraft firing, and plane guard duties throughout the two days of action that broke the back of Japanese naval aviation. On the night of 20 June, she participated in the memorable night recovery of the last strikes, flashing beacon lights, and rescuing aviators forced to ditch by lack of gasoline. On 21 June, the carrier force steamed back to cover the invasion forces in the Marianas, hurling strike after strike at Guam, Rota, and later the bases in the Pagan Islands and on Chichi Jima. \"Charrette\" fired in the bombardment of Chichi Jima 5 August, then returned to Eniwetok for training operations.\n\n\"Charrette\" sailed from Eniwetok 29 August 1944 for the air strikes of early September against targets in the Palaus and the Philippines which paved the way for the invasion of Peleliu and marked the beginning of the return to the Philippines. In direct preparation for the invasion of Leyte, the carrier task force sailed again on 4 October for strikes designed to neutralize Japanese airfields on Okinawa, Northern Luzon, and Formosa during the assaults in the Philippines. On 12 October began the most important part of these strikes, against Formosa, which provoked return attacks by Japanese aircraft on the carrier forces. \"Charrette\" aided in splashing attackers and driving off the raids during which the cruisers and were hit. \"Charrette\" joined the screen which guarded the cripples during their slow retreat from enemy air range, then rejoined her carrier group for the dash north to intercept the approaching Japanese force. Thus she began her part in the epic Battle for Leyte Gulf, the decisive action which resulted in the end of the Imperial Japanese Navy as an effective fighting force. The carriers she guarded launched strikes at the Japanese northern force in the action termed the Battle off Cape Engaño, sinking four Japanese carriers and a destroyer on 25 October.\n\n\"Charrette\" replenished at Ulithi 29 October to 2 November 1944, then joined the screen of the fast carriers for strikes on Luzon airfields early in November, which sharply reduced enemy air opposition at the Leyte beachhead. \"Charrette\" returned to Manus 30 November to prepare for the Lingayen Gulf operation.\n\nSailing 2 January 1945, \"Charrette\" joined the screen of the group which protected and supported the landings at Lingayen from 4 to 18 January, then guarded the approach and withdrawal of reinforcement convoys into Lingayen Gulf. She left the Philippines 2 February, and on 25 February arrived at Puget Sound Navy Yard for overhaul. She returned to action waters in June, beginning a month of support for the Borneo operations, followed by patrol duty in the Netherlands East Indies. On 2 August, she and the destroyer made contact with a ship which they tracked through the night, finding in the morning that it was the hospital ship \"Tachibana Maru\". A boarding party from \"Charrette\" found much ordnance and other contraband and able-bodied troops, who were made prisoners of war. \"Charrette\" and \"Conner\" brought their prize into Morotai 6 August.\n\n\"Charrette\" cleared Morotai 13 August 1945 to call at Subic Bay before reporting at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, in September for duty escorting ships loaded with occupation troops, equipment, and supplies for Chinese ports. She sailed from Shanghai 12 December for San Francisco, California which she reached 30 December. \"Charrette\" was placed in commission in reserve at San Diego 4 March 1946, and out of commission in reserve 15 January 1947. On 16 June 1959 she was transferred to Greece.\n\nThe ship was accepted by Commander G. Moralis, RHN, on 16 July 1959 in Long Beach, California, and arrived in Greece on 15 October 1959. She served in the Hellenic Navy as \"Velos\" (D16) (, \"Arrow\"). \"Velos\" took part in almost every Greek and NATO exercise and actively participated in the crises with Turkey of the years 1964, 1967, 1974 (Cyprus crisis) and 1987.\n\nOn 25 May 1973, \"Velos\", under the command of Nikolaos Pappas, while participating in a NATO exercise and in order to protest against the dictatorship in Greece, anchored at Fiumicino, Italy, refusing to return to Greece.\n\nWhen in patrol with other NATO vessels between Italy and Sardinia ( southwest of Rome) at midday on 25 May 1973 the captain and the officers had learned by radio that naval officers had been arrested and tortured in Greece. Commander Pappas was a member of a group of democratic officers, loyal to their oath to obey the Constitution and planning to act against the junta. Pappas knew the arrested officers opposed the junta and realised there was no further hope for a movement inside Greece. He decided to act alone to motivate global public opinion.\n\nPappas mustered the crew on the stern and announced his decision, which was received with enthusiasm. Pappas signaled his intentions to the commander of the squadron and NATO Headquarters, quoting the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty (founding treaty for NATO) which declares that \"\"all governments ... are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law\".\" Leaving formation, he sailed for Rome.\n\nThat afternoon, he anchored about off the coast at Fiumicino. Three officers (Ensigns K. Gortzis, K. Matarangas, G. Stratos) went ashore in a whaleboat. From Fiumicino Airport they telephoned the international press agencies to inform them of the situation in Greece and the presence of the destroyer. They arranged for a press conference to be held the next day by Commander Pappas. This action sparked international interest in the situation in Greece. The captain, six officers, and twenty-five petty officers requested asylum and remained in Italy as political refugees. Initially, the entire crew wished to follow their captain (170 men signed a request), but they were advised (and some ordered) by their officers to remain on board because of the fear of retaliation by the regime against their families. The men were told to return to Greece and to inform their families and friends about what had happened. \"Velos\" returned to Greece a month later with a replacement crew, and the refugees continued the struggle against the dictatorship. After the fall of the junta on (24 July 1974), some of the officers and petty officers returned to the navy. Commander Pappas reached the rank of vice admiral and served as the chief of the Hellenic Navy General Staff from 1982 to 1986.\n\n\"Velos\" was decommissioned on 26 February 1991, having sailed in her 48-year career.\n\nIn 1994 the Hellenic Navy General Staff declared her a Museum of the Struggle against the Dictatorship (). The ship, then anchored at Poros Naval Base, was transferred on 14 December 2000 to Salamis Naval Base for maintenance and restoration work in order to be converted into a visitable naval museum. Since 26 June 2002 she has been anchored in the Naval Tradition Park at Palaio Faliro, Athens. \"Velos\" is regarded as still in commission.\n\n\"Charrette\" received 13 battle stars for her World War II service.\n\n"}

It stars Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eyþór Guðjónsson, and Barbara Nedeljáková about a mysterious organization that tortures and kills kidnapped tourists.\n\nIt was produced by Eli Roth, Mike Fleiss, and Chris Briggs. It is the first installment of the \"Hostel\" trilogy, followed by \"\" and \"\". \n\nCollege students Paxton and Josh are travelling across Europe with their Icelandic friend Óli. In the Netherlands, they visit an Amsterdam nightclub, followed by a brothel. Unable to get back into their hostel because of a curfew, they accept the offer of a man named Alexei to stay at his apartment. He convinces them that, instead of going to Barcelona, they should visit a hostel in Slovakia which is filled with beautiful and desperate women and few tourists in contrast to Barcelona, where they would have to compete with other tourists for the local women.\n\nThe three board a train to Slovakia, where they encounter a strange Dutch Businessman who touches Josh's leg. Josh yells at him, causing him to leave.\n\nArriving in Slovakia, they are impressed by the beauty of the town and the grandeur of the hostel and find their roommates are two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana. The women invite them to the spa, and later to the disco. Outside the disco for some fresh air, Josh has a run in with a gang of local criminal kids who are Gypsies. The Dutch Businessman intervenes to defend him. Josh buys him a beer and apologizes for his reaction on the train.\n\nPaxton and Josh have sex with Natalya and Svetlana, while Óli leaves with the desk girl, Vala. The next morning, Óli doesn't return, and cannot be contacted. The desk clerk tells them Óli checked out. The two are then approached by a Japanese woman named Kana, who shows them a photo of Óli and her friend Yuki, who is also missing. Later the group receive a message from Óli with a supposed selfie claiming he has gone home. Elsewhere, Óli is already killed and decapitated, while Yuki is being tortured. Josh is anxious to leave, but Paxton convinces him to stay one more night with Natalya and Svetlana. Both women later slip both men tranquilizer. Josh feels sick, goes back to the hostel and faints on his bed. Also feeling sick, Paxton goes to the bathroom but takes the wrong way and ends up locked in the pantry.\n\nJosh wakes up in a dungeon-like room, where the Dutch Businessman begins maiming him with a drill. Musing over his dream of becoming a surgeon, the Dutch Businessman drills holes into Josh's body, slices his achilles tendons, then slits his throat with a scalpel.\n\nPaxton wakes up in the disco and returns to the hostel and learns that he had supposedly checked out and his backpack was already at the front desk. Irritated, Paxton argues he didn’t check out and demands a room. In his new room, he is greeted by two women, who invite him to the spa in an eerily similar manner to Natalya and Svetlana. He finds a now rough-looking Natalya and Svetlana and asks them if they know where Josh is. They answered he went to an “art exhibit”, to where Paxton asks to go too. Natalya agrees to lead him to Josh and takes him to an old factory. There, Paxton sees Josh's mutilated corpse being stitched together by the Dutch Businessman. He is then captured and dragged, passing by several rooms where other people are being gruesomely tortured. He is restrained in a chair and prepped to be tortured by a German client named Johann. Paxton attempts to plead with the man by speaking German, but this only leads to him having a ball-gag placed in his mouth, which he eventually removes after Paxton vomits in fear thanks to having a chainsaw brandished at him. \n\nWhile cutting off Paxton's fingers, Johann unintentionally removes his restraints. As Paxton gets off the chair, Johann charges at him, but slips on the ball-gag and falls over, severing his own leg with a chainsaw. Paxton reaches for a gun and shoots Johann in the head, then proceeds to kill a guard, then leaves the room. He passes by a room where a man is getting rid of the various mutilated corpses by putting it into an incinerator, and kills him with a sledgehammer.\n\nHe then finds the elevator to the top floor and enters the dressing room, where he changes into business clothes and finds a business card for the Elite Hunting Club, which is an organization where rich people pay to kill and mutilate tourists.\n\nOn the way out, Paxton discovers Kana, who is being disfigured with a blow torch. Paxton kills the client and flees with Kana in a stolen car, pursued by guards. While driving, Paxton sees Natalya, Svetlana, and Alexei; he runs them over, killing them. While driving Paxton encounters the Gypsy delinquents and gives them candies and gum. The Gypsies then attack and kill the men of Elite Hunting pursuing Paxton with concrete blocks. \n\nThe two make it to the train station. Kana, seeing her disfigured face, kills herself by leaping in front of an oncoming train. Taking advantage of the commotion, Paxton boards another train unnoticed. Aboard, Paxton hears the voice of the Dutch Businessman. When the train stops in Vienna, Austria, Paxton follows him to a public restroom and kills him. He then boards another train.\n\nIn the Director's Cut, Paxton kidnaps the Dutch Businessman's daughter instead of killing him. After finding her teddy bear in the restroom she was supposed to be in, the Dutch Businessman searches for his missing daughter, unaware that Paxton's train has just left.\n\nAfter the release of \"Cabin Fever\", Eli Roth was met with praise from several industry figures. One such person was Quentin Tarantino, who listed the film in his \"top 10\" of the year and immediately reached out to Roth and offered to produce his next feature film. Roth was offered to direct many studio films, mostly horror remakes such as \"The Last House on the Left\", \"The Fog\", and a film in the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" franchise, among several others, but turned them all down on advice from Tarantino, who suggested he make an original horror film. While swimming in Tarantino's pool, Roth brainstormed an idea for a low-budget horror film based on a Thai \"murder vacation\" website he came across on the internet. Tarantino loved the idea and encouraged Roth to immediately start writing a draft that day, which later formed the basis for \"Hostel\".\n\nRoth had originally debated creating the film in the style of a fake documentary that would incorporate real people and locations from supposed real underground \"death vacation\" spots. When little information could be found on the topic, the idea was scrapped in favor of a fictional flowing narrative. Principal photography took place in the Czech Republic, and many scenes were shot in Český Krumlov. The torture chamber scenes were filmed in the abandoned wing of an old Prague hospital.\n\nThe original music score was composed by frequent Roth collaborator Nathan Barr and commissioned The Prague Filmharmonic Orchestra to perform the score over a four day period in October 2005.\n\n\"Hostel\" opened theatrically on January 6, 2006, in the United States and earned $19.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number one in the box office. By the end of its run, six weeks later, the film grossed $47.3 million in the US box office and $33.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $80.6 million.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 61% based on 108 reviews and a weighted average of 5.84/10. The site's consensus stating, \"Featuring lots of guts and gore, \"Hostel\" is a wildly entertaining corpse-filled journey—assuming one is entertained by corpses, guts, and gore, that is.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 55 out of 100 based on 21 reviews.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\"s film critic Owen Gleiberman commended the film's creativity, saying \"You may or may not believe that slavering redneck psychos, of the kind who leer through Rob Zombie's \"The Devil's Rejects\", can be found in the Southwest, but it's all too easy to envision this sort of depravity in the former Soviet bloc, the crack-up of which has produced a brutal marketplace of capitalistic fiendishness. The torture scenes in \"Hostel\" (snipped toes, sliced ankles, pulled eyeballs) are not, in essence, much different from the surgical terrors in the \"Saw\" films, only Roth, by presenting his characters as victims of the same world of flesh-for-fantasy they were grooving on in the first place, digs deep into the nightmare of a society ruled by the profit of illicit desire.\"\n\nGerman film historian Florian Evers pointed out the Holocaust imagery behind \"Hostel\"s horror iconography, connecting Roth's film to the Nazi exploitation genre.\n\n\"The Guardian\" film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that \"Hostel\" was \"actually silly, crass and queasy. And not in a good way\". David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\" was equally negative, deriding director Roth with creating the horror subgenre \"torture porn\", or \"gorno\", using excessive violence to excite audiences like a sexual act. Jean-François Rauger, a film critic for \"Le Monde\", a French newspaper, and programmer of the Cinémathèque Française, listed \"Hostel\" as the best American film of 2006, calling it an example of modern consumerism. \"Hostel\" won the 2006 Empire Award for Best Horror Film.\n\nThe film's release was accompanied by strong complaints from Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Slovak and Czech officials were both disgusted and outraged by the film's portrayal of their countries as undeveloped, poor, and uncultured lands suffering from high criminality, war, and prostitution, fearing it would \"damage the good reputation of Slovakia\" and make foreigners feel it was a dangerous place to be. The tourist board of Slovakia invited Roth on an all-expenses-paid trip to their country so he could see it is not made up of run-down factories, ghettos, and kids who kill for bubble gum. Tomáš Galbavý, a Slovak Member of Parliament from the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party, commented: \"I am offended by this film. I think that all Slovaks should feel offended.\"\n\nDefending himself, Roth said the film was not meant to be offensive, arguing, \"Americans do not even know that this country exists. My film is not a geographical work but aims to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them.\" Roth has repeatedly argued that despite the many films in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" series, people still travel to Texas.\n\n"}

{"id": "2331674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331674", "title": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard", "text": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Dragonshard is a real-time strategy role-playing video game, developed for Microsoft Windows by Liquid Entertainment, and published by Atari in 2005. It takes place in Eberron, one of the official \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign settings. The game combines elements of traditional real-time strategy gameplay with role-playing elements such as hero units, and questing. \"Dragonshard\" includes two single-player campaigns, single-player skirmish maps, and multiplayer support. The single-player campaign follows the struggles of three competing factions to gain control of a magical artifact known as the Heart of Siberys.\n\n\"Dragonshard\" combines aspects of real-time strategy (RTS), and role-playing games (RPGs). Games take place on dual level maps divided into the surface world of Eberron, and the underground realm of Khyber. Units travel between the surface, and the underground through gateways that are fixed on each map. The surface map features traditional RTS gameplay: the player builds and develops base structures, gathers resources, and amasses, and upgrades an army. Unlike most real-time strategy games, all units are available at the beginning of the game, rather than having prerequisites to allow their construction. There are three player-controllable factions in the game: the Order of the Flame, the Lizardfolk, and the Umbragen.\n\nArmies consist of the following unit types:\n\n\nOnly champions and ground-based captains can travel underground, which focuses underground gameplay on a party of individual units rather than the surface world's squad-based armies, and plays more like a role-playing game. Underground maps feature party-based dungeon crawling gameplay: units must negotiate traps, gather treasure, and hunt monsters. Items are stored in a global inventory accessible to all units.\n\n\"Dragonshard\" has three resources:\n\nPossible locations for bases and expansions are predetermined by the map. Furthermore, each base or expansion is self-contained, with individual buildings placed on a fixed grid behind protective walls. The limited size of each base places strategic limitations on the makeup of the player's army.\n\nExperience points in \"Dragonshard\" are assigned to a global pool. The player spends experience points at unit-producing structures to level up captains. Once the player levels up a captain type, all captains of that type belonging to the player are leveled up, and new captains of the type start at the upgraded level. To train a captain above level two, the player must build two or more unit-producing structures of the same type in the same group of four building pads. To reach the maximum captain level of five, the player must fill a group of four building pads with four unit-producing structures of the same type. Instead of filling a group of four pads to maximize a captain's level, the player may opt to build one or more monuments that grant bonuses to all unit types produced from adjacent buildings. Champions do not level up but they can be upgraded in campaign mode with \"Champion Artifacts.\"\n\n\"Dragonshard\" has single-player campaigns for the Order of the Flame and Lizardfolk factions, each of which includes seven missions, plus single-player and multiplayer skirmish maps. Single-player campaign maps feature main quest goals that advance the storyline and optional side-quests that provide bonuses such as inventory items, experience points, gold, and Champion Artifacts. Unused items are stored in an item vault between missions. Upon completion of a campaign map, players earn \"Reward Points\" depending on how skillfully they played. Reward Points can be spent between campaigns to buy items from the item vault or upgrade champions with additional Champion Artifacts.\n\nSingle-player and multiplayer skirmish games have one mandatory and three optional win conditions:\n\n\"Dragonshard\" takes place in the world of Eberron. In the creation myth of Eberron, the dragon Khyber warred with his sister Siberys and shattered her body to pieces. In his anger, Khyber's brother Eberron wrapped him in his coils, trapping Khyber. The bodies of the three dragons became the three parts of Eberron's world: the surface Eberron, the Ring of Siberys that encircles Eberron, and the underworld of Khyber. The three world parts produce dragonshards, crystal and rock fragments imbued with magic power.\n\nThe Heart of Siberys is the largest dragonshard in Eberron. When it fell from the Ring of Siberys to the continent of Xen'drik, it created a storm-swept mountain range known as the Ring of Storms and caused a city to sink into the earth. Its immense magical force caused the natural creatures of the Ring of Storm to evolve into the Lizardfolk. To this day, the Heart draws factions into conflict over control of its power.\n\nIn addition to the playable races, Eberron is populated by a number of neutral non-player factions and creatures, including the illithids, longtime foes of the Umbragen, a host of golems constructed by an extinct elven race, ettins, and thri-kreen.\n\n\"Dragonshard\" is the first video game set in the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign setting of Eberron. Eberron's creator Keith Baker wrote the storyline for \"Dragonshard\". However, some discrepancies exist between the game and the canonical \"Eberron Campaign Setting\". Siberys dragonshards should be gold in color, but they are blue in the game. Building new warforged is forbidden under the Treaty of Thronehold that ended the Last War — the only sources for new warforged are Merrix d'Cannith's illegal forge in Sharn and the Lord of Blades' forge in the Mournland. However, in the game, the Order faction can build Warforged Titans.\n\nThe Order of the Flame is the military wing of the Church of the Silver Flame, an organization dedicated to banishing evil. The Order of the Flame is an alliance of cultures and traditions including humans, dwarves, halflings, and celestials. Led by the cleric Lady Marryn and guided by the Dwarven shaman Amathor, the Order travelled to the Ring of Storms to capture the Heart of Siberys and claim its magical power, but were annihilated by the Lizardfolk in a cataclysmic battle for the Heart of Siberys. Amathor, the Titan Bastion and barely an eighth of the original population of the Order's followers escaped to their spaceports so that they could evacuate from Eberron and set course for pastures new. The Order of the Flame can recruit Archons of the heavens, mighty Warforged Titans, fierce Sorcerers and Deathless Guardians.\n\nThe Umbragen are rumored to be the remnants of a race of elves that inhabited the ancient city Qalatesh. Qalatesh was destroyed and sank into Khyber after an apocalyptic shard storm, some survivors of the storm fled into Khyber. To survive against the horrors of Khyber, these elves harnessed Khyber's dark energies and integrated them into their culture, becoming the Umbragen. Led by the evil Satros, their goal is to drain the Heart of its power and use it to unlock the secrets of the ruins of Qalatesh. The Umbragen has dark shadow creatures, including flying demons and knights of darkness.\n\nThe lizardfolk are the native inhabitants of the Ring of Storms. They are rumored to have been placed in the region by dragons to protect the Heart of Siberys. Over time, exposure to the energies of the Heart altered them and granted them sentience. They were united by the hero Darroc, who sacrificed his life to defend the Heart from Order of the Flame invaders. The lizardfolk lived in peace for centuries since Darroc's death, but the Order and Umbragen incursions forced them to take up arms again. Darroc was resurrected later on by the four greatest living heroes of the Lizardfolk people; Redfang the Drakelord, Silverblade the Yuan-ti Pureblood, Wowen the High Shaman and Blackclaw the Master of Decay, and oversaw the bonding of the War Feldrakes for use in the coming war, but was later destroyed for the second and last time when the Ilithid Enchanter Orobus pulled down an especially huge Dragonshard that smashed Darroc's avatar to pieces. Lizardfolk focus on brute force, with units such as giant turtles and dragons.\n\nDragonshard received generally positive reviews from the gaming press. The game was praised for blending traditional real-time strategy with \"D&D\" role-playing elements. The main criticism for the game was that it had a short single-player mode, underscored by the complete lack of an Umbragen campaign.\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" named \"Dragonshard\" the sixth-best computer game of 2005. They wrote, \"As an attempt at recapturing the energy of those dorky all-night \"D&D\" sessions, it knocks more ideas out of the park than most games even bother to swing at.\"\n\n"}

He is also known for his collaborations with Grammy Award-Nominated Electronic/Dance artist Nadia Ali, which include their 2006 duet \"Something To Lose\" for Ultra Records, and the song \"Promises\" on Ali's 2009 solo album \"Embers.\"\n\nPaul Bosko began collaborating on house music projects in 2003 with New York-based DJ/producers John Creamer & Stephane K, and when Creamer and his club scene counterparts nicknamed him \"Rosko,\" it eventually stuck and became his moniker as a recording and performing artist in the electronic and dance music industry.\nHe should not be confused with DJ Emperor Rosko.\n\nPaul Bosko's musical work, ranging from folk-pop to alternative dance, sometimes featured DJ/producer Lance Jordan in a co-producing role, and occasionally as co-writer and lead guitarist as well. Bosko and Jordan met in 2001 at a Music and Internet Expo sponsored by mp3.com at Madison Square Garden.\nIn 2003 the duo were shopping an album they made together, \"Paul Bosko/Dressed To Play,\" when they began searching for remixers, and caught the attention of Creamer & K, who had just been named 2002 Remixers of the Year by \"Remix\" Magazine. C & K joined the project as producers, and in 2004 the label NY Love Records was created as a vehicle for releasing their original material.\n\nThe 2005 anthem Love Is A Drug would become his first big hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, going all the way to #1. The fusion of Rosko's bluesy, classic guitar-rock style, combined with the pioneering house music grooves of the production team, is self-described as \"Rock/House\" (as in \"rock the house,\" or \"to infuse house music with rock and roll elements\"). Rosko has cited artists like New Order and Depeche Mode, as well as the 70s music of Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac, as major influences.\n\n\"Love Is A Drug\" went on to appear on several dance compilations, including Grammy Award-winning Peter Rauhofer's 2006 album \"I Love New York.\" The single was followed by another Creamer and K collaboration, this time a duet with Nadia Ali of iio, titled \"Something To Lose.\" The duet was signed by Ultra Records, and championed on the UK's BBC Radio 1 by influential DJ and tastemaker Pete Tong. Subsequently, Ultra quickly licensed the record to Roger Sanchez's \"Release Yourself vol. 5,\" as well as to the Global Underground solo debut of DJ/Producer Sharam (of the Grammy Award-winning duo Deep Dish), titled \"Dubai.\" Another Rosko single, \"Milkbone,\" was released in September 2006 by Lance Jordan's own independent label, Dusk Recordings.\n\nRosko performed as Singer and Keyboardist in Nadia Ali's 2006–2007 World Tour which stretched from North Africa to Eastern Europe and ended in Central America. Along the way, the two shared the stage with Tiësto, Armand Van Helden, and John Creamer & Stephane K, among others.\n\n\n\n"}

Cortlandt Manor is situated directly east, north and south of Peekskill, and east of three sections of the Town of Cortlandt, Croton-on-Hudson, Crugers, and Montrose. Most of the area is made up of residential homes. Cortlandt Manor also encompasses Cortlandt Estates.\n\nThe term \"Cortlandt Manor\" derives from the history of Westchester County. Until the Revolutionary War, Westchester County was split into six manors, one of which was van Cortlandt Manor of the van Cortland family.\n\nUntil 1991, this area shared a mailing address and ZIP Code (10566) with the city of Peekskill. Although it now has its own ZIP code, 10567, many directories and censuses still do not include Cortlandt Manor, because it is an unincorporated section of the Town of Cortlandt. The 10567 zip code was created by the US Postal Service to differentiate this part of the Town of Cortlandt from Cortland, New York, which is located hours away in upstate NY.\n\nCortlandt Manor residents are served by Hendrick Hudson Central School District, Lakeland Central School District, and Putnam Valley Central School District. Two schools in Hendrick Hudson Central School District are located in Cortlandt Manor: Furnace Woods Elementary School and Blue Mountain Middle School, which are separated by several soccer fields.\nTwo of the Lakeland Central School District schools are located in Cortlandt Manor: Van Cortlandtville Elementary School and Walter Panas High School.\n\nThe Aaron Copland House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\nThe Van Cortlandt Upper Manor House is located off Oregon Road in Cortlandt just outside the Peekskill city limits. The Upper Manor House was part of the estate of Stephanus Van Cortlandt, the colonial aristocrat and patroon who owned nearly all of northern Westchester County in the late 17th century. The more familiar centerpiece of the old estate, Van Cortlandt Manor, is located in the nearby village of Croton-on-Hudson.\n\n"}

Prior to this, she wrote a cookery column both for \"The Spectator\" and for the Oldie.\n\nThe pair were famous for their rich traditional meals made from scratch. Paterson was known for her liberal use of butter and cream, remarking on her television show in her usual manner with a shake of the hand, that yoghurt was only fit for vegetarians and those with \"a poor tummy\". They travelled to filming locations throughout the UK on Paterson's Triumph Thunderbird motorbike with Dickson Wright occupying the sidecar.\n\nPaterson came from an Army family, of which she later wrote, \"My mother had no idea of how to cook and no wish to learn, existing on gorgonzola, coffee, and chocolates after the demise of any form of servant. My father, having gone through two World Wars, was far too frightened to put on a kettle and my brothers, who married young to very good wives... never showed any signs of wanting to whip up something delicious for a treat.\"\n\nPaterson was expelled from convent school at 15 for being disruptive. Paterson later became a matron at a girls' boarding school near Reading before ending up as a cook for the Ugandan Legation in London and becoming a well-known figure on the London party circuit. She worked on the ITV show \"Candid Camera\" and later became a food writer for \"The Spectator\"; for 15 years, she provided weekly lunches for personalities, including the Prince of Wales. She later wrote a book of recipes and reminiscences from her time at \"The Spectator\" entitled \"Feast Days, Recipes from The Spectator\", in the introduction to which the English writer A. N.

The band played punk and R&B songs as well as covers like \"You Really Got Me\" by the Kinks and \"Peaches\" by the Stranglers, but Gill and Balfe changed their musical views, dissolving the band to go in a far more experimental direction.\n\nGill and Balfe next founded the experimental band Dalek I Love You in December 1977, along with David Hughes and Chris Teepee.\n\nGill was also an influential member of the Teardrop Explodes, playing lead guitar and co-writing their biggest hit \"Reward\" with frontman Julian Cope, which reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart. Gill performed on their 1980 gold-selling album \"Kilimanjaro\". He was an influence on Cope, as documented in the latter's 1994 autobiography \"Head On\", in which Cope described Gill as his \"guru\", turning him from \"tense to loose to slack in three months\". Gill introduced Cope to LSD before leaving the band to concentrate on Dalek I Love You.\n\nAfter Dalek I Love You released their final album, Gill turned to film scoring, most notably for the 1985 film \"Letter to Brezhnev\" in which he worked with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1985, Gill also formed the cassette-only Bop-a-dub label, which released the Dalek I Love You album \"Naïve\". In 1991, Gill scored the film \"Blonde Fist\". Also that year, Gill acted as engineer for legendary British folk musician Davey Graham. Part of Graham's album \"Playing in Traffic\" was recorded at Gill's studio in Raby Mere, Wirral. Around this time Gill became disillusioned with the hard-edged music business and retreated from the music scene completely, notably not picking up a guitar for 15 years.\n\nGill's band inspired the title of \"Dalek I Love You\", a radio drama which premiered on the British digital radio station BBC Radio 7 on 11 February 2006. The story centred on a man obsessed with \"Doctor Who\" who falls in love at a science fiction convention. The band also inspired the title of \"Dalek I Loved You\", an autobiography by the journalist Nick Griffiths about his life as a \"Doctor Who\" fan, published in 2007.\n\nIn 2009, a Dalek I Love You track, \"The World\", was featured on the soundtrack to the film \"Awaydays\". Gill's guitar, painted by himself in a tribal style, is played by main protagonist Elvis in one scene. In 2010, Gill, along with Balfe and Gary Dwyer (minus Cope), picked up a Mojo \"inspiration\" award for the Teardrop Explodes at the MOJO Awards in London. Afterward, Gill immersed himself in music again and embarked on a new band project called the Most High, with Simon Walthew (bass), Ikem Washner (drums) and Phil Channell (keyboards and flute).\n\n"}

He has lived in Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois and New York City, New York. Stratton currently resides in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nBeginning violin lessons at the age of 8, Stratton followed quickly with lessons in the cello, piano, and guitar. It was through the piano that Stratton discovered a passion for writing and performing songs. After graduating from Michigan's Interlochen Arts Academy, Stratton moved to Los Angeles to pursue his career. His first album release on a major label, \"\"Standing at the Edge\"\" for Sony Music Entertainment received positive reviews in magazines like People and Billboard.\n\nCasey began writing songs at the age of 11. He first performed his own songs live while attending Interlochen Arts Academy at the age of 16. The response lead Casey to begin contemplating becoming a professional singer/songwriter. It was also during this time period that he began performing in Coffeehouses in Michigan.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles in 1995, Casey quickly signed an independent recording contract with Magic Records. Work then began on the recordings that would eventually become his first full-length release, \"The Giver and the Grave Digger\", which was released in 1996. In late 1995 Magic Records released \"Driving to the Moon EP\" which garnered considerable critical acclaim and exposure in the Los Angeles music scene. This led to a string of live performances at the now defunct Luna Park venue.\n\nIn 1997, after deciding not to renew his contract with Magic Records, Casey began his first self-produced album, \"Lily Sleeps\". This project marked an experimental phase for Casey. Over 90 tracks were written and recorded during this time. While the album was never released in CD format, it is now available in the DIGITAL MUSIC STORE at www.caseystratton.com.\n\nAlso in 1997, Casey recorded a cover of the song \"Regret\" for \"Blue Order - A Trance Tribute to New Order\".\n\nThe songs from \"Lily Sleeps\" gained some industry attention and Casey signed a publishing contract with Rondor Music Publishing in 1997. It was during this time that Casey began recording \"Whirlwind Medusa\". This is also when the first recordings of future favorites \"Hollow\" and \"House of Jupiter\" were completed. In 1999 Casey was informed that his contract with Rondor Music Publishing would not be renewed. This led to a dark period in the performer's life. In the summer of 2000 Stratton moved to Chicago where he began a nearly two-year hiatus from the record industry. He immersed himself in writing and recorded an independent album called \"The Winter Children\". Many of these tracks would be re-recorded later and included on his Sony release \"Standing at the Edge\".\n\nCasey returned to the recording industry in 2002. Shortly after moving to New York City, Stratton inked a deal with Sony Music. in January 2003 he flew to Los Angeles to begin recording \"Standing at the Edge\" with legendary producer Patrick Leonard. Originally intended for an August 2003 release, \"Standing at the Edge\" was initially delayed until October 2003. Eventually the album would be delayed yet again and ultimately released in on January 20, 2004.\n\nAfter \"Standing at the Edge\", Stratton gained further success when the Junior Vasquez remix of \"\"House Of Jupiter\"\" went to #1 on the Billboard Dance chart, and remained there for 20 weeks in 2005. This was followed by Vazquez's remix of \"Blood\". Casey left Sony Music in December 2004. Stratton's 6th studio album, \"\"DIVIDE\"\", was released in October 2005 on Stratton's independent label, Sleeping Pill Music (ASCAP).

A tour was being planned but was eventually scrapped due to financial concerns. Casey frequently discusses the strains of being an independent musician in these times and is in strong opposition to music piracy.\n\nCasey's album, \"Orbit\", was digitally released on February 5, 2008. This was followed by \"Signs of Life\" which was digitally released in August 2008 and physically released on CD in November. \"Messages Sending\" digitally released in April 2009. No plans are in place for a CD release at this time.\n\nCasey started a Podcast in May 2008 in which he discusses his career and life in addition to live performances.\n\n\"Memories and Photographs\" was released in September 2009, followed by \"A Winter Moon\", an album of holiday music, in December 2009.

He is the shy, long-suffering assistant of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, and is likewise named after a piece of laboratory equipment.\n\nDuring the first season of \"The Muppet Show\", Dr. Honeydew presented the Muppet Labs segments by himself; Beaker was added as his lab assistant from the second season on. Beaker has bulging eyes, a shock of red hair, and a drawbridge mouth which serves as a frown. He was originally puppeteered and voiced by Richard Hunt until Hunt's death in 1992, when the role was taken over primarily by Steve Whitmire. After Whitmire was fired in 2016, David Rudman took over the character.\n\nBeaker is a magnet for disaster; he routinely experiences mishaps such as being blown up, electrocuted, eaten by large monsters, or afflicted with awkward side effects caused by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's experiments. Beaker communicates in a nervous, high-pitched squeak that sounds like \"Mee-mee-mee mee\". In books and merchandise, the sound is spelled \"Meep\". In \"The Muppet Movie\", he \"meeps\" Honeydew's line \"sadly temporary\". Rarely he can say normal words, such as \"Bye-bye.\" Otherwise, his tone or expression helps to communicate his meaning.\n\nBeaker rapidly became a favorite with audiences, who both sympathized with and enjoyed laughing at his humorous sufferings. Occasionally, Beaker was able to take revenge, particularly in a segment when he inadvertently made numerous copies of himself and spent the rest of the episode chasing Dr. Honeydew around the theater. (This segment of \"Muppet Labs\" was from the Mac Davis episode.) In the 2008 TV special, \"\", Beaker is even more fortunate when he tests a wish machine and gets the company of model Petra Němcová, and not only refuses Honeydew's order to send her back, but then also successfully teleports away with her to apparently enjoy his first wish for the rest of the story.\n\nBeaker has also appeared as a musical performer, singing \"Danny Boy,\" \"Carol of the Bells,\" and \"Habanera\" with the Swedish Chef and Animal, and \"Feelings\" and \"Dust in the wind\" solo. He also sang \"Ode to Joy\" with his clones who were accidentally formed by Dr. Honeydew's copying machine. The \"Danny Boy\" performance was marked by the Chef's singing in his trademark gibberish and Animal's inability to remember anything but the first three words. For \"Feelings,\" Animal had to shush the increasingly unruly crowd (who tormented the Muppets throughout the episode) so Beaker could finish: \"QUIET!!...Thank you.\" In the 2011 film \"The Muppets\", Beaker sang a comedic a cappella version of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as part of a barbershop quartet with Sam the Eagle, Rowlf the Dog and Link Hogthrob. Because of Disney's designation of the Muppets franchise as being for family audiences, Beaker was given a crucial role replacing the song's more questionable lines like \"a mulatto\" and \"my libido\" with \"mee-mee-mee-mo.\"\n\nThe two scientists were later incorporated into the \"Muppet Babies\" animated series. Howie Mandel (during early seasons) and Dave Coulier voiced Bunsen, and Frank Welker provided Beaker's squeaky meeps. Beaker was performed by Kevin Clash in \"The Muppet Show Live\". An animated Beaker was also voiced by Richard Hunt, his usual performer during that period, when he appeared in the short lived \"Little Muppet Monsters\" series.\n\nBeaker's \"meep\" sound has become a well-known catchphrase, and is referenced in various media.\n\nIn a 2004 Internet poll sponsored by the BBC and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew were voted Britain's favourite cinematic scientists. They beat Mr. Spock, their closest rival, by two-to-one, winning a third of the total votes.\n\nBeaker features in an episode of WWE Raw, assisting Santino Marella ringside in his match with Jack Swagger by providing him with a special energy drink formulated by Dr. Honeydew. In the same episode, Beaker is revealed to be distantly related to WWE wrestler Sheamus.\n\nUK politicians Danny Alexander\nand Ed Miliband have both been disparagingly likened to Beaker in appearance. Due to the enormity and length of his head, Fionnán Sheahan (the spouse of Averil Power and Independent News & Media loyalist) is often likened to and referred to as Beaker. It is, however, worth noting that Sheahan's forehead is significantly more pronounced than the Beaker Muppet character and the overall head shape when closely observed is that of a crescent.\n\n\n"}

Gilmor's daring raids, such as The Magnolia Station Raid through north-central Maryland in July 1864 during the third major Confederate invasion of the North gained his partisans fame as \"Gilmor's Raiders\".\n\nGilmor was born at \"Glen Ellen\", the Jacobethan/English Tudor-styled \"Castle\" family estate, near the village of Warren, (now beneath the surface waters of the Loch Raven Reservoir), just north of Towsontown in central Baltimore County, Maryland.

Benjamin F. Butler of the 6th & 8th Massachusetts state militia in May 1861. Upon his release, he traveled South and eventually rejoined the fighting serving, for a while, under General Turner Ashby. He was again captured during the Maryland Campaign and spent five months in prison. During the Gettysburg Campaign of June–July, 1863, Major Gilmor was assigned command of the First Maryland Cavalry and Second Maryland Cavalry, supporting Brig. Gen. George Steuart's infantry brigade. Gilmor was the provost marshal of the town of Gettysburg while it was occupied by the Confederates July 1–4.\n\nAs part of the third major Confederate invasion of the North, this under commanding Gen. Jubal Early with several corps of troops on a mission to attack the national capital at Washington, D.C. and possibly liberate Southern prisoners-of-war at Camp Point Look-Out in southern Maryland at the confluence of the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River in St. Mary's County. After the Battle of the Monocacy, along the Monocacy River on July 9, 1864, southeast of Frederick in Frederick County, Maryland, Colonel Gilmor's command, along with Frederick's Brig. Gen. Bradley T. Johnson's Maryland Confederate infantry and cavalry, made a series of raids around Baltimore going as far east as Magnolia Station in Harford County, Maryland and Fork, Maryland. On July 10, 1864, Major Harry Gilmor of the 2nd Maryland Cavalry was given 135 men of the 1st and 2nd Maryland, and directed to cross northern Baltimore County into Harford County at Jerusalem Mill, and destroy the railroad bridge of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad at Magnolia Station, across the Gunpowder River, northeast of the city, in Harford County. In the meantime, while crossing his home county, he stopped and visited his family at the family estate \"Glen Ellen\", then near the former village of Warren, now beneath the surface of Loch Raven Reservoir. Early on July 11, Gilmor's advance group passed the home of Ishmael Day on Sunshine Avenue in Fork. Day, a strong Union sympathizer, had hung a large United States flag to greet Gilmor's troops. Sergeant Eugene Fields, a member of the advance guard unit, told Day to take the flag down. Day refused, so Sgt. Fields dismounted to do it himself. Day shot Field at close range with a shotgun. Day immediately fled, hiding under an apple cider press for days until the passing troops were gone. Gilmor's men then burned Day's home and barn. Maj. Gilmor sent Sgt. Field to Wright's Hotel (operated by W.O.B. Wright on the Harford Road), where he later died.\n\nAt about 8:40 in the morning on July 11, Gilmor's cavalrymen reached the station and proceeded to stop two northbound trains from Baltimore. After evacuating the passengers, the troopers set fire to the second train and backed it down the tracks and onto the bridge. The train burned through the draw section of the bridge and effected much damage to the area around it. Aboard the first train was a convalescing Union Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin. This raid was regarded as one of the most daring during the war by detached cavalry on either side.\n\nGilmor was eventually ordered to take his command to Hardy County, West Virginia, and attack the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. There, he was captured on February 4, 1865 by Major Henry Young, chief of scouts for Major General Philip Sheridan, and was held as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren in Boston Harbor until July 24, 1865, three and a half months after Lee's surrender at Appomattox.\n\nAfter the war, Gilmor moved to New Orleans, where he married Miss Mentoria Nixon Strong, daughter of Jasper Strong and Eliza Julia Nixon. Gilmor and his wife had three children.\n\nGilmor wrote his war memoirs, entitled \"\"Four Years in the Saddle\"\" (published in New York, Harper & Bros., 1866). He soon returned to Maryland and was elected a colonel of the cavalry in the reorganized Maryland National Guard. He also served as the Baltimore City Police Commissioner from 1874 to 1879, (a position which his Civil War predecessor, Police Marshal George Proctor Kane was arrested by Federal authorities in 1861, he also later was elected as Mayor of Baltimore). Gilmor died in Baltimore, plagued by complications from a war injury to his jaw. He was buried in Loudon Park Cemetery in the southwest section of the city between Frederick Road and Wilkens Avenue, in an area of the cemetery now known as \"Confederate Hill.\" At his death, Baltimore City Police Department central and district stations flew their flags at half-staff. Gilmor's funeral was a large local ceremonial event with many dignitaries present to honor this war hero.\n\nThere is also a Gilmor Street laid out between Calhoun Street running south to Cole Street in West Baltimore's Upton, Sandtown-Winchester, Poppleton neighborhoods.\n\n"}

Nostromo is a unique name, but was also the title of the main starship in the 1979 \"Alien (film)\" and the 1904 novel \"Nostromo and the Razer Nostromo, also a gaming keypad\".\n\nIt can be considered a keyboard/joystick/mouse hybrid, which allows for a more convenient control method for many video games. In \"extremetech\"'s reviewthey point out how the Nostromo SpeedPad n52 was different than its competitors and the standard keyboard. \nIt can also be used outside of games, for example to support cartographic software. It is the followup to the older SpeedPad n50, and is also intended to replace the keyboard during gaming.\n\nThe device is currently supported under Windows 98, 2000, ME, XP (both 32- and 64-bit versions), and Vista (both 32- and 64-bit versions). Additionally, the Windows Vista driver can be used to install the device on a Windows 7 system and retain all functionality.\n\nIt is also supported under Mac OS 9.04 or later, and Mac OS X v10.1.2 up to 10.4.8. The programming software does work on Intel-based Macs. Intel Mac drivers are supplied. The n52 requires a Pentium 233 MHz or equivalent with 32MB RAM, as well as 30MB free hard drive space.\n\nThe n52 is made in a black and silver design with a few orange accents. It features a rubber-coated base, and is weighed down with a metal weight for stability. The user must place his left hand on the device to use it, as it was designed for right-handed people, who usually use a mouse with their right hands. The n52 has a movable hand rest which can be set to 2 locations or removed to create 3 different hand positions to better suit various hand sizes by means of lifting the rest off the unit.\n\nA large space is used for a keyboard-like section with 14 keyboard keys, numbered 1 through 14, by default used to represent the WASD space on regular keyboards in the case of first-person shooters, one of the intended target audiences of the n52. These keys can be controlled with the users second to fifth fingers. Below where the thumb rests, there is a slightly wider keyboard-style button, labeled 15, similar in use to the shift key on regular keyboards.\n\nOn the right side of the device, there is a scroll wheel, like those normally found on mice, which can be controlled with the index finger. To the right of that, there is a round button, as well as an 8-way D-pad normally found on gamepads, intended to be used with the thumb.\n\nAll of these controls can be programmed with the included \"Nostromo Array Programming Software\" to emulate any keyboard function or keyboard macro. They can also be programmed to change the device's \"state\". The n52 has 4 different color-coded states, indicated by 3 LEDs below the fifteenth button. If a user changes the state of the device from the normal one, the red, green, or blue LED lights up, and all other controls now represent a different function. The state-button can be set to act as a temporary shift button that works while it is pressed, a toggle button, or it can be set to work until it is pressed again. In total, this allows up to 104 different functions. The software can recognize games by their executable filenames, and automatically load the appropriate profile when that game is started. User-created profiles, which are technically single files, can be submitted to Belkin via e-mail, making them available for others to download.\n\nThe ability to add macros allows users to more easily work with data in spreadsheets and similar programs by creating a row of: Cut, Copy, Paste, and Enter keys, and by making the D-pad emulate the arrow keys.\n\nStarting January 2008 (delayed from November 2007) an updated version called the Belkin n52te will be sold. This version does not feature the word \"Nostromo\", and has the additional \"te\", meaning \"tournament edition\". The device is black and has a blue backlit keypad and scroll wheel. The user can \"hot-swap\" player profiles, a capability supported by built-in memory. The device runs software created by Razer.\n\nSince the n52te was released however, many fans of the original have voiced their concerns that the n52te is lacking several features that were present in the original n52, mostly within the profiling software produced by Razer which has been criticized by owners of the original as being significantly less sophisticated than the original Belkin software.\n\nExamples of missing features are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2331877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331877", "title": "Sikhism and sexual orientation", "text": "Sikhism and sexual orientation\n\nSikhism has no specific teachings about homosexuality and the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, does not explicitly mention heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality.\n\nThe universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of factors like race, caste, color, creed, gender or sexuality. Within the last few years, the topic of homosexuality has become much more discussed in religions all over the world, making the once-taboo topic of homosexuality now a subject for open discussion among adherents.\n\nGiani Joginder Singh Vedanti of the Akal Takht (the temporal Sikh authority in India) has condemned homosexuality. In March 2005, he told visiting Sikh-Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs) that they had a religious duty to oppose same-sex marriage: \"The basic duty of Sikh MPs in Canada should be to support laws that stop this kind of practice [homosexuality], because there are thousands of Sikhs living in Canada, to ensure that Sikhs do not fall prey to this practice\".\n\nThe divide between supporters and opponents of LGBT rights has become increasingly clear, creating a largely generational rift between older conservatives and younger liberals. Many Sikhs believe there is nothing wrong with being LGBT or supporting LGBT rights more generally, including same-sex marriage. These Sikhs believe that the view of some preachers in the Akal Takht is flawed.\n\nThe Sikh Rehat Maryada emphasizes the importance of a family lifestyle, and many Sikhs believe that since same-sex partners can't reproduce and make a family that homosexuality should be condemned. This heteronormative way of viewing the family is questioned by those who believe Sikhism is more tolerant of people not viewed as “normal”. Many Sikh adherents believe the Rehat Maryada is meant to be interpreted and applied to life liberally rather than treated as a binding contract.\n\nThe Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, details what behaviour is expected of all Sikhs. It frequently encourages a married life. Marriage in Sikhism is seen as a union of souls, and the soul is seen as genderless, with the outward appearance of human beings (man, woman) being a temporary state. Same-sex marriage advocates refer to this as support for marriage equality in Sikhism. The Laavaan, the main part of Anand Karaj, are read at Sikh weddings for the union of two souls through marriage. In these hymns there is no mention of gender, but rather the participants are regarded as souls that are genderless. Marriage is seen as a spiritual journey to achieving lasting happiness through committing to the faith.\n\nAlthough the topic of homosexuality in Sikhism is tabooed, the younger generation is looking to the internet for answers. The internet has become a new way for young Sikhs born inside and outside of India to discuss the religion and current issues anonymously through the internet. The internet allows people to get the information they need without the discomfort of talking about it within the community. The internet has become a tool for young Sikhs to get information about current issues that may not be discussed directly within their communities.\n\nThere are some individuals that are using the power of the internet to discuss issues of homosexuality in the community. Junaid Asif, also known as Sikh Knowledge, openly speaks about his queer identity. He uses his platform to discuss his experience as a sexual minority within the Sikh community and how he believes that there is a conversation that needs to be had. He did an interview with Kevin Newman where he discussed the lack of discussion about homosexuality in the Sikh and Punjabi community. This is the first time homosexuality in Sikhism has ever been discussed on live television on a Western news channel, and it addressed a topic that isn't normally discussed in the community. Another Sikh named Manjinder Singh is using YouTube to open up about his experiences as a gay Sikh man. He's creating his own platform on YouTube to reach a wider audience and is trying to get dialogue in the community started by defining what it means to be queer. In one of his videos, he has a conversation with his mother about homosexuality in Punjabi. This video defines what it means to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, and being transgender in Punjabi and is targeted to the audience that doesn't necessarily understand the different sexual and gender identities. Other famous Sikh YouTube stars such Sikh Canadian comedian Jus Reign (Jasmeet Singh), have openly voiced their support for LGBT rights.\n\nBoth the Sikh identity and sexual identities affect a person's self concept and how they relate to their community. Like other religions, Sikhism strives to cultivate a sense of identity through religious practices, but in Sikhism, there is a shared common physical identity too. Through the process of identity formation, people begin to build a sense of individuality that allows them to find communities of people that they identify with. Identity formation at the intersection of Sikh and sexual identities has not been a focus of many studies. As the Sikh diaspora starts forming in places like Britain, some researchers are interested in understanding how these ethnic, religious, and sexual identities affect one's self-concept. Many queer Sikhs find it difficult to reconcile their religious identity with their sexual identity.\n\nSome research is aiming to understand how the Sikh narrative and the narrative of sexuality coincide and conflict with one another. In an article written by David Mair for the University of Birmingham, David examines the life narrative of an openly gay, practicing Sikh named Daljeet. This study aimed to understand how clashing narratives affect one's self-concept and relationship to the community at large. After having an in-depth conversation with Daljeet, David found that many of the struggles that he faced were because of the clash of narratives in his own life. Daljeet's narratives of Indian masculinity, ethnicity, religion, and sexuality conflicted with one another and his self-concept is deeply affected by it. Those who do not conform to heteronormative and binary definitions of gender and sexuality are tasked with creating a new narrative that incorporates all aspects of their identity in an encompassing way.\n\n\n"}

Century decided to import the WASR to meet U.S. demand for AK-style firearms. U.S. federal code 18 USC 922R stipulates that no more than ten major components of a firearm categorized by federal law as a \"semi-automatic assault weapon\" could be manufactured outside the U.S. The WASR-series rifles take their name from the 1996 Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral export control regime (MECR), the purpose of which is to monitor and limit the proliferation of certain conventional weapons and dual-use technologies.\n\nThe WASR-series rifles use a Romanian-made receiver, but lack the dimples (used to center the magazine) above the magazine well seen in the other AK series of rifles. Instead WASRs use internally welded spacer plates to center the magazine. The arrangements of the rivets on the receiver and front and rear trunnions are also different from many other AK derivatives. There are no known clones of the WASR series rifles to date. The lack of dimple and rivet layout allows for positive ID in the many different stock configurations.\n\nWASR-series rifles are manufactured with stamped sheet metal receivers that were originally intended for single-stack magazines. Featuring hard chrome-lined barrels, side-mount scope rail and wooden stocks, WASR-series rifles are commonly imported to the United States by Century International Arms.\n\nIn Romania the rifles are manufactured to conform with certain United States firearms regulations including Title 18, Chapter 44, of the United States Code, which defines laws for manufacturing and importing firearms such as semi-automatic only fire. Century Arms modifies the weapon with upgraded fire control groups (i.e. trigger), pistol grips, and plastic folding or collapsible stocks manufactured by TAPCO of Georgia.\n\nOlder WASR-series rifles commonly produced \"trigger slap\", which is caused by the bolt slamming backward into the trigger assembly and causing significant pain to the shooter's trigger finger. Beginning in 2007, Century International Arms has installed the TAPCO Intrafuse AK G2 trigger group, eliminating the painful trigger slap problem. Rifles with this trigger group will have \"TAPCO USA G2\" stamped on the left side of the trigger. Some of these rifles may exhibit canted front sight blocks and gas tubes.\n\nWASR-series rifles are inexpensive and easily customized, with hundreds of aftermarket stocks, muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, telescopic sights, and other accessories available.\nThe WASR-10 is a post-ban version of the AKM rifle in 7.62×39mm caliber. Factory-original rifles only support single-stack, low-capacity magazines (10-rounds). After import, Century Arms offered WASR rifles modified to accept double-stack, standard-capacity magazines (machining burrs on the magazine well may cause some magazines to fit improperly if the burrs are not removed). Pistol grip and thumbhole stocks were both commonly fitted to WASR rifles.\n\nAfter the sunset of the 1994 assault weapons ban, importers were able to legally equip WASR-10s with compensators, bayonet lugs, and folding stocks, thus making the GP WASR-10 (with GP standing for general purpose). Some advantages of this rifle are the reliability of the gun and the availability of standardized aftermarket parts.\n\nThe GP WASR-10/63 was built using the same newly-manufactured single-stack receiver and chrome-lined barrel as the GP WASR-10, and the two models are cosmetically similar. However, while the GP WASR-10 was made with new parts, all parts on the GP WASR-10/63 (other than the receiver and barrel) came from a former Romanian military rifle. The original year of manufacture can be seen engraved on the left side of the trunion (the trunion is visible where it protrudes through the receiver on the left side, near the front), along with the original rifle's serial number. Dates seem to range from the early 1960s to the 1980s. Most or all small metal parts are marked with the last few digits of the original serial number. As with other WASR models imported into the United States, Century Arms modified these rifles to accept normal 30-round magazines.\n\nThe pistol grip, trigger group, slant muzzle brake and gas piston were replaced with U.S.-made substitutes to comply with U.S. regulations.\n\nThere are rumors that the GP WASR-10/63 was built from rejected parts. This is not true. All parts had passed inspection and the original rifle had been accepted into actual military service.\n\nBecause the GP WASR-10/63 originated as a Romanian military rifle, Century Arms sold them with many of the original rifle's accessories, such as a bayonet, oil bottle, magazine pouch and cleaning kit.\n\nThe WASR-22 or AK-22 Trainer is a .22 Long Rifle, semi-automatic cadet rifle loosely based upon the AK-47 and manufactured in Romania by Cugir Arms Factory. Unlike the AK-47, it uses a simple blowback method of operation. As such, it has no gas system and the internal components have been modified accordingly. While designed to be a cadet rifle for basic firearms and marksmanship training for the Romanian Army, it was never used as such. Instead, it was sold on the civilian market, primarily in the United States in collaboration with Century International Arms. Because of its cheap ammo and low recoil, it is marketed as a “starter” or “trainer AK”. It is usually shipped with two 10-round magazines and is currently sold with the price ranging from $200 to $500 USD.\n\nThe WASR-2 is essentially a WASR-10 chambered in 5.45×39mm, and usually does not come with any accessories (muzzle brake, bayonet), especially if it is ordered straight from Century Arms.\n\nSpare parts were difficult to come by until the import of AIMS74 kits were imported around 2018. These parts were often a direct match. While some suffered from reliability issues due to parts made on old tooling and loose tolerances, most were reliable.\n\nThis commercial export version of the WASR is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO (which can also safely fire the .223 Remington round). It usually comes in the same configuration as the WASR-2. These have known problems with jamming or failure to feed. This may be due to low quality magazines, or their followers. The WASR-3 was originally supplied with surplus 5.45×39mm AK-74 magazines, which do not reliably feed the 5.56/.223 cartridge. People have used Wieger magazines with some success. Century Arms eventually began including Romanian copies of the reliable Wieger magazine with these rifles. Some switch the follower of an AK-74 magazine with one from Robinson Arms. Israeli Galil steel magazines are also known to work without modification in the WASR-3. Some owners have also modified the rifle to accept Bulgarian Circle-10 5.56 magazines, or Polish Beryl 5.56 magazines. These sometimes require some material to be removed from the receiver center support bar.\n\n\n"}

A number of modern reproductions of the original moraharpa have been made since the 1980s, and the name \"moraharpa\", in addition to referring to a single, specific instrument, has come to mean a type of nyckelharpa similar in design to the original moraharpa.\n\nThe instrument has an inscription on the back with the date 1526, but it is unlikely to have been made that early.

{"id": "2331898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331898", "title": "Into the Music", "text": "Into the Music\n\nInto the Music is the 11th studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, and was released in August 1979. It includes \"Bright Side of the Road\", which peaked at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart, and other songs in which Morrison sought to return to his more profound and transcendent style after the pop-oriented \"Wavelength\". The record received favourable reviews from several music critics and was named as one of the year's best albums in the Pazz & Jop critics' poll.\n\n\"Into the Music\" was recorded in early 1979 at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, with Mick Glossop as engineer.\n\nDuring the recording of the album, one of the musicians, trumpet player Mark Isham, referred Morrison to Pee Wee Ellis who lived nearby. Morrison brought him in to do the horn charts for \"Troubadours\", but Ellis remained and worked on the entire album. The band also included Toni Marcus on strings, Robin Williamson on penny whistle, and Ry Cooder playing slide guitar on \"Full Force Gale\".\n\nAccording to \"Hymns to the Silence\" author Peter Mills, \"Into the Music\" was titled after Ritchie Yorke's 1975 biography of the same name on Morrison, while the book had been titled in reference to his song \"Into the Mystic\" (1970).\n\nMorrison wrote most of the songs while he was staying with Herbie Armstrong in the Cotswold village of Epwell, England, and the sense of place is reflected in the spirit of the music. During this time, he would often walk through the fields with his guitar composing the future album's songs.\n\nErik Hage commented that after the favourable commercial reception of \"Wavelength\", Morrison was inspired to \"return to something deeper, to once again take up the quest for music, that was spontaneous, meditative, and transcendent—music that satisfied the other side of his artistic nature.\" Morrison was quoted on his opinion of the album, \"\"Into the Music\" was about the first album where I felt, I'm starting here...the \"Wavelength\" thing, I didn't really feel that was me.\" (1988) \"That's when I got back into it. That's why I called it \"Into the Music\".\" (1984)\n\nThe opening track, \"Bright Side of the Road\" peaked at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart. The healing power of music would be subtly introduced on \"And the Healing Has Begun\", and would be a continuing theme in Morrison's music. Although celebration of love and life was the predominant theme of the album, this was especially true of \"Troubadours\", \"Steppin' Out Queen\" and \"You Make Me Feel So Free\". \"Troubadours\" is an uplifting celebration of the singer-songwriter from ancient days, walking through towns \"singin songs of love and chivalry\". \"Rolling Hills\" is a joyful song in which the singer directly refers to Christianity and to living his life \"in Him\" and reading the Bible. The album is notable for its interpolation of an elegiac version of the fifties pop hit \"It's All in the Game\", which was voted 813rd on Dave Marsh's list of 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made. It was a B-side of the Morrison song \"Cleaning Windows\".\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Rolling Stone\", Jay Cocks hailed \"Into the Music\" as a daring \"record of splendid peace\" and \"vastly ambitious attempt to reconcile various states of grace: physical, spiritual and artistic\". \"That's what this album is about, proudly and stunningly and with no apologies\", Cocks wrote. \"Resurrection. Real Hope.\" Tom Bentkowski from \"New York\" found Morrison's spirituality casually but confidently expressed in songs that are \"introspective, impressionistic\", and \"charged by the author's overwhelming belief in them\". \"High Fidelity\" was impressed by Morrison's ability to explore a diversity of universal emotions and called the album \"the full-circle complement to his most cosmic, allegorical work\", veering from gospel-rooted R&B and Gaelic songs to rock and roll blended with \"heartfelt religious fervor\". \"There's a general sense of happiness and clarity here\", the magazine wrote, \"as if Morrison has finally distilled his feelings down to their most essential musical level.\" In \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau deemed \"Into the Music\" his best record since 1970's \"Moondance\" while writing that like Bob Dylan, Morrison had \"abandoned metaphorical pretensions, but only because he loves the world\". Morrison's simple odes to rural life, he believed, were made vivid and deeper by backing musicians such as Marcus and \"by his own excursions into a vocalese that has never been more various or apt.\" Christgau viewed \"It's All in the Game\" as the album's only great song, however, and was somewhat critical of the \"lightweight rockers\" and \"You Know What They're Writing About\", which he felt sounded tedious halfway through.\n\nDon Snowden of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described \"Into the Music\" as \"a more personal, more definitely Van Morrison album than \"Wavelength\"\", but complained that \"Bright Side of the Road\" and \"You Make Me Feel So Free\" lacked the \"rhythmic punch and melodic substance\" of the artist's early-1970s R&B songs and that elsewhere, \"tempos often drag when they should push and few of the melodies make any lasting impression.\" Snowden also wrote: \"Despite sporadically interesting passages, the four songs on the second side carry on far too long.\" Reviewing for the \"NME\", Paul Rambali welcomed Morrison's return to \"Veedon Fleece\"-style musical arrangements but said, with the exception of \"Full Force Gale\" and \"Rolling Hills\", they lacked the precision that Jeff Labes had brought to the artist's earlier work and instead \"merge the songs into a jaunty, lightweight mass\". He also said that Morrison's singing lacked conviction and concluded: \"I hate records like this – neither particularly good nor especially bad but just, well, pleasant. They hang there frustrating you in the run-off grooves ... And I hate this even more because Van Morrison made it, and because he set out with the right idea this time, too.\"\n\n\"Into the Music\" was voted the sixth-best album of 1979 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide; Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it fourth on his own year-end list. In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (1983), Dave Marsh later said the second half's suite of nocturnal ballads was \"the greatest side of music Morrison has created since \"Astral Weeks\"\". Morrison biographer Erik Hage called the record \"a fully fleshed-out musical vision that often surrenders to rapturous moments of pure beauty\".\n\nAfter the release of \"Into the Music\" and before his next release \"Common One\" in 1980, Morrison appeared at the Montreux Jazz Festival with a fleshed-out band. He performed two of the songs from the album, \"Troubadours\" and \"Angeliou\". These two songs featured Morrison interacting with the brass section, composed of Pee Wee Ellis and Mark Isham. Erik Hage describes this musical relationship between Morrison and the two brass musicians as \"simply stunning\". Morrison's 2006-released DVD, \"Live at Montreux 1980/1974\", contained these performances of the two songs.\n\nThe 29 January 2008 reissued and remastered version of \"Into the Music\" contains alternative takes of \"Steppin' Out Queen\" and \"Troubadours\".\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison, unless noted.\n\n\n\n\nMusicians\n\nProduction\n\nBillboard\nUK Album Chart\n"}

The school is known for its International Baccalaureate student program, but also runs French Immersion programs and visual art, music, and co-operative education programs.\n\nDespite being designed for over two thousand students, Merivale High School's population has fallen to an all-time low of 650 students for the 2013-14 school year. This is attributed to changing neighborhood demographics, as well as new schools in the subdivision of Barrhaven. It was announced in October 2016 that Merivale High School will be adding both grades 7 and 8 to increase student enrollment for the 2016/2017 school year. With the addition of grade 7 and 8 students from various feeder schools, the student body increased to around 1200.\n\nThe school's sports moniker is the Marauders, and the school's colours are maroon and gold.\n\nOn March 12, 1963, then Board Chairman John Dawson announced that plans were being prepared by architects McLean and MacPhadyen for the new $1,800,000 Merivale High School and should be handed in for tender call by April 15. Mr. Dawson stated that although the school was slated to open in 1964, it could be possible to open one of its wings for the upcoming school year should there be a shortage of space in other schools. The new high school will ultimately serve 1,400 students with 900 expected to attend in 1964. It was planned to have thirteen classrooms, nine laboratories, four shops a library, a gymnasium, combined cafeteria-auditorium and administration rooms.\n\nThe school was first built in 1964. According to aerial photos taken in these time periods and old yearbook photos, the school opened with the \"A\" Wing and \"B\" Wing (the main front building), \"E\" Wing and \"T\" wing constructed. The school then received an expansion of an added \"D\" Wing and \"L\" Wing by 1965. The buildings were completed by December and were to include the English, Geography, History, and commercial classes which were at the time held in the Gym, Cafeteria and basement. By 1968 all the current buildings were complete. In 1970 the Library, in between the two \"D\" and \"E\" wings, would be added on.\n\nThe school has witnessed many changes around its premises, such as the re-alignment of Viewmount Road (back then Borden Side Road) and the increase of commercial enterprises like Merivale Mall in the 1960s and 1970s. Construction and development slowed down in the 1980s and 1990s but in 2002 a new shopping complex was built across the street as well as a Harvey's nearby, providing students many more places to go during lunch.\n\nDue to its location on the increasingly commercially developed Merivale strip, and its reduced importance since the completion of John McCrae Secondary School in Barrhaven, efforts had been made by the province to close the school in the late 1990s as a means of saving money. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to a large amount of community and student body support for the school. In 2005, with the closure of Laurentian High School and J. S. Woodsworth High Schools, Merivale took in the remaining students as well as remaining school equipment and staff from both schools, maintaining a strong solid student population.\n\nIn early December 2005 an electrical fire destroyed the interiors of the main office, student services and guidance departments. The damage was estimated at CA$100,000 and a temporary wall had to be constructed to facilitate reconstruction. The new office opened in 2006.\n\nThe school is currently under review by parent groups and the school board over how the school will continue running in the future, such as how the school's grade system and programs will work (either making it into a combined 7-12 hybrid system like the new Longfields-Davidson Heights school, keeping it the same, or re-routing students to a different location altogether).\n\nThe school is among the top schools in Ontario for academics and Fine Arts. In 2000, a team of Merivale students won the \"Reach for the Top\" national championship; in 2003, the school was named champion on the CBC television series \"SmartAsk\".\n\nThe school's music program is considered one of the best in the Ottawa area: the school's ensembles regularly win \"gold\" standings at regional MusicFest competitions, and won 5 golds when they attended the 2000 national finals at York University. The school also competed in the 2006 national MusicFest competition with 7 ensembles, all achieving a grade of silver or higher.\n\nMerivale is active in dramatic arts. Their musical production of \"Lucky Stiff\" was nominated thirteen times for the Ottawa-area Cappie awards in 2005-2006, an awards ceremony for high school productions. It took home eight awards, the most of any school that year. Recently, Merivale has won the Cappies Favourite Musical two years in a row with \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" (2011) and \"Fame\" (2012) under the direction of Cynthia Wood.\n\nIn 1999, the student newspaper, \"The Vanguard\", won First Place (for a credit course newspaper) in the Toronto Star High School Newspaper Awards, a first for the publication. \"The Vanguard\" had previously won multiple first place awards in a similar competition held by the \"Ottawa Citizen\".\n\nAs well, the school also holds a yearly Art Show in May/June, showcasing student artwork as well as technology and carpentry, under the direction of the Fine Arts Head of Department, Irving Osterer.\n\nIncluding both varsity and club teams, the school has over thirty athletic groups sporting the Marauder name.\n\nThe Merivale High School boys football team won the City Championship in 2005, competing in the Tier 2 division.\n\nFollowing a year in which the school was forced to suspend its football program, an influx of athletes from the recently closed J.S Woodsworth Secondary helped the program en route to a successful season in which the team went undefeated.\n\nIn 2008, Merivale High School placed first overall in the NCSSAA Swim Meet in early December.\n\nIn 2010–11, the Varsity Boys Hockey team won the Tier 2 city championships, coming from behind to defeat Louis Riel 2 games to 1, winning the clinching game in front of a packed home arena. The team was led by senior Stephen Byford, and rookie goaltender Caleum Tweedale.\n\nIn September 2011, the school had to cancel its football program for good.\n\nAfter an athletic year off in 2012–13 due to the province-wide work to rule motion, athletics returned in 2013–14. The school holds an annual Athletic Banquet at the end of the year.\n\nIn both 2014 and 2017, the girls field hockey team made it to OFSAA after an undefeated season where they placed top 8th in the province\n\n\n"}

After playing college football with the Washington State Cougars, he was selected by the Lions in the second round of the 1992 NFL Draft with the 56th overall pick. Hanson holds the NFL record for the most seasons played with one team and also holds multiple kicking and scoring records.\n\nBorn in Spokane, Washington, Hanson graduated from Mead High School in 1988, where he lettered in football, basketball, and soccer. As a senior, Hanson won All-Greater Spokane League honors as both a kicker and punter and was named a first team All-State honoree by the Washington Sportswriters Association. In the classroom at Mead, he maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point average. \n\nHanson attended Washington State University in Pullman, where he walked-on as a freshman in 1988 and made an immediate impact with the Cougars; he was named to \"The Sporting News\" Freshman All-America team. Hanson set or tied many NCAA records, and his percentage of 57.1 for field goals from 50 yards or greater remains a Pac-12 Conference record. He holds the record for most field goals from 50 yards or more (20), and 40 yards or more (39). Hanson's school records include most points scored (328), longest field goal (62 yards), most games with two or more field goals (20), field goals (63), and PATs (139). He was also the punter at WSU during his final two seasons, and was a teammate of quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who arrived in 1990. Hanson earned a bachelor of science degree from WSU in pre-med studies, with 3.78 grade point average.\n\nHanson was selected in the second round of the 1992 NFL Draft by the Lions, the 56th overall pick. He retired from the Lions in 2013; no NFL player played as many games (327) with the same team as Hanson, breaking the old record of 296 held by Bruce Matthews in Week 2 of the 2011 season vs. the Kansas City Chiefs. At the beginning of the 2012 season, he set the record for most years with the same club with 21 seasons.\n\nOn December 14, 2008, against the Indianapolis Colts, Hanson passed Morten Andersen for most 50+ yard field goals in NFL history. Hanson again had a good year, ending the 2008 NFL season 21-for-22 on field goal attempts (including 8 for 8 from 50+ yards) and 25-for-26 on extra point attempts. Statistically, this was the second best season of Hanson's career with respect to field goal attempts; he missed only one. After the late 2010 NFL season, Hanson had missed only eight extra points in his career, five of which were blocked.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, the Lions placed him on injured reserve due to an injured right knee.\n\nHanson was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Month for September 2011 after kicking a perfect 8 of 8 field goals. It was his fifth-career Special Teams Player of the Month award and his first since November 2003.\n\nHanson is the team's all-time leader in scoring, with 2,150 points, and in field goals with 495, and holds a variety of other team records for kicking and scoring. He represented the NFC in the Pro Bowl in 1998 and 1999, and was an alternate in 1997 and 2008. He has booted 17 game-winning field goals in his career; eight in regulation and nine in overtime.\n\nOn April 4, 2013, Hanson announced his retirement. At the time of his retirement, he was the oldest active player in the NFL, the last player to have played for the same team he played for prior to the advent of free agency, and the last active player to play at Milwaukee County Stadium.\n\nHanson was named the 2002 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association/Pro Football Writers Association's Media-Friendly \"Good Guy\" Award. The Good Guy Award is given yearly to the Detroit Lions player who shows consideration to, and cooperation with the media at all times during the course of the season.\n\nThe Detroit Lions inducted him into the Ring of Honor in fall 2013 at Ford Field for his success and dedication to Detroit Lions football.\n\n\nHanson and his wife, Kathleen, were married in 1992 and have three children. His younger brother Travis was a kicker for the rival University of Washington Huskies, and was a member of the 1991 national championship team. Hanson is a Christian. \nJason Hanson's eldest son, Ryan, is best known for winning three Intramural Championships in one year: Men's Soccer, Coed Soccer, and Coed Badminton. Ryan has continued his career at Oakland University, winning Dodgeball Tournaments as well as pick-up basketball games. However more recently he’s known for blowing a 4-1 lead in big ball to his friends. \n\n"}

He also played keyboards on and co-produced the first Echo & the Bunnymen and Teardrop Explodes albums, as well as managing both bands with Bill Drummond for the years from their inception to their early success.\n\nBalfe and Drummond, having met while playing together in Big in Japan, founded the Zoo record yassslabel in 1978 in order to release Big in Japan's posthumous EP \"From Y to Z and Never Again\". The label went on to sign and release the early work of the Teardrop Explodes and Echo & the Bunnymen.\n\nBalfe and Drummond did their production work under the name of The Chameleons, and also released the singles \"Touch\" and \"The Lonely Spy\" – credited to Lori and The Chameleons – on the Zoo label, later licensing them to Sire/Korova.\n\nAlthough they released a few other artists, the Teardrop Explodes and Echo & the Bunnymen grew to take up most of their time. Eventually, due to lack of finance, they signed both bands to major London Record Companies and continued to manage them, while letting the label fade into inactivity.\n\nBalfe and Drummond's publishing company, Zoo Music, signed many of the above and below artists, as well as multi-million selling acts the Proclaimers in 1987 and Drummond's later band the KLF.\n\nBalfe began as the Teardrop Explodes' label head, manager and producer, but after their first single, on the departure of their original keyboard player, Paul Simpson, Balfe stepped in for what turned into four years in and out of the band, having a famously tempestuous relationship with their singer, Julian Cope. He played keyboards on their Top 10 single, \"Reward\", and their two gold albums, \"Kilimanjaro\" (1980) and \"Wilder\" (1981).\n\nAfter the Teardrop Explodes disbanded in 1983, Balfe moved to London where, after managing Strawberry Switchblade (UK top 5 Hit, \"Since Yesterday\") and Brilliant (the post-Killing Joke band of subsequently famous producer Youth), he then founded the Food record label in 1984.\n\nFood, initially funded by Balfe alone, signed Voice of the Beehive, Zodiac Mindwarp (both of whom moved on to major labels, while Balfe continued to manage them for many years), Crazyhead, and Diesel Park West, before signing a deal with EMI to fund and distribute the label worldwide while retaining creative independence.\n\nThey then signed Jesus Jones who went on to have a number one album in the UK and multi-million sales internationally with their second album, \"Doubt\", and a number one single in the U.S. with \"Right Here Right Now\". A year after signing Jesus Jones they signed Blur.\n\nBalfe, along with later label partner Andy Ross, convinced the band to change their name from 'Seymour' to Blur on signing in 1989.\n\nBalfe also directed Blur's first two music videos, \"She's So High\" and \"There's No Other Way\".\n\nDisenchanted with the alternative scene in the years of grunge, Balfe decided to sell the Food label to EMI in 1994, and semi-retire with his young family to the country – inspiring Damon Albarn to pen Blur's first No. 1 hit, \"Country House\".\n\nBalfe returned to the music business to take up a position at Sony Music from 1996 to 1999 as General Manager and Head of A&R of the Columbia label. His most notable success of that period was the million-selling Kula Shaker.\n\nSince then Balfe has received a BA in Creative Writing from the University of Bedfordshire in 2003 and, in 2006, an MA in screenwriting from the University of Westminster.\n\nIn June 2010, Balfe received the \"Mojo Magazine\" 'Inspiration Award' on behalf of the Teardrop Explodes. It was presented by Alex James from Blur.\n\nIn May 2018, Balfe was elected as a Labour councillor for Eastbrook Ward in Adur.\n\n"}

{"id": "2331922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331922", "title": "Luminous paint", "text": "Luminous paint\n\nLuminous paint or luminescent paint is paint that exhibits luminescence. In other words, it gives off visible light through fluorescence, phosphorescence, or radioluminescence. There are three types of luminous paints.\n\nFluorescent paints offer a wide range of pigments and chroma which also 'glow' when exposed to the long-wave \"ultraviolet\" frequencies (UV). These UV frequencies are found in sunlight and some artificial lights, but they—and their glowing-paint applications—are popularly known as black light and 'black-light effects', respectively.\n\nIn fluorescence the visible light component—sometimes known as \"white light\"—tends to be reflected and perceived normally, as colour; while the UV component of light is modified, 'stepped down' energetically into longer wavelengths, producing additional visible light frequencies, which are then emitted alongside the reflected white light. Human eyes perceive these changes as the unusual 'glow' of \"fluorescence\".\n\nThe fluorescent type of luminescence is significantly different from the natural bioluminescence of bacteria, insects and fish such as the case of the firefly, etc. Bio-luminescence involves no reflection at all, but living generation of light (via the chemistry of Luciferin).\n\nThere are both visible and invisible fluorescent paints. The visible appear under white light to be any bright color, turning peculiarly brilliant under black lights. Invisible fluorescent paints appear transparent or pale under daytime lighting, but will glow under UV light in a limited range of colors. Since these can seem to 'disappear', they can be used to create a variety of clever effects.\n\nBoth types of fluorescent painting benefit when used within a contrasting ambiance of clean, matte-black backgrounds and borders. Such a \"black out\" effect will minimize other awareness, so cultivating the peculiar luminescence of UV fluorescence. Both types of paints have extensive application where artistic lighting effects are desired, particularly in \"black box\" entertainments and environments such as theaters, bars, shrines, etc. The effective wattage needed to light larger empty spaces increases exponentially, with narrow-band light such as UV wavelengths being rapidly scattered in outdoor environments.\n\nPhosphorescent paint is commonly called \"glow-in-the-dark\" paint. It is made from phosphors such as silver-activated zinc sulfide or doped strontium aluminate, and typically glows a pale green to greenish-blue color. The mechanism for producing light is similar to that of fluorescent paint, but the emission of visible light persists long after it has been exposed to light. Phosphorescent paints have a sustained glow which lasts for up to 12 hours after exposure to light, fading over time.\n\nThis type of paint has been used to mark escape paths in aircraft and for decorative use such as \"stars\" applied to walls and ceilings. It is an alternative to radioluminescent paint. Kenner's \"Lightning Bug Glo-Juice\" was a popular non-toxic paint product in 1968, marketed at children, alongside other glow-in-the-dark toys and novelties. Phosphorescent paint is typically used as body paint, on children's walls and outdoors.\n\nWhen applied as a paint or a more sophisticated coating (e.g. a thermal barrier coating), phosphorescence can be used for temperature detection or degradation measurements known as phosphor thermometry.\n\nRadioluminescent paint is a self-luminous paint that consists of a small amount of a radioactive isotope (radionuclide) mixed with a radioluminescent phosphor chemical. The radioisotope continually decays, emitting radiation particles which strike molecules of the phosphor, exciting them to emit visible light. The isotopes selected are typically strong emitters of beta radiation, preferred since this radiation will not penetrate an enclosure. Radioluminescent paints will glow without exposure to light until the radioactive isotope has decayed (or the phosphor degrades), which may be many years.\n\nBecause of safety concerns and tighter regulation, consumer products such as clocks and watches now increasingly use phosphorescent rather than radioluminescent substances. Radioluminescent paint may still be preferred in specialist applications, such as diving watches.\n\nRadioluminescent paint was invented in 1908 by Sabin Arnold von Sochocky and originally incorporated radium-226. Radium paint was widely used for 40 years on the faces of watches, compasses, and aircraft instruments, so they could be read in the dark. Radium is a radiological hazard, emitting gamma rays that can penetrate a glass watch dial and into human tissue. During the 1920s and 1930s, the harmful effects of this paint became increasingly clear. A notorious case involved the \"Radium Girls\", a group of women who painted watchfaces and later suffered adverse health effects from ingestion. In 1928, Dr von Sochocky himself died of aplastic anemia as a result of radiation exposure. Thousands of legacy radium dials still owned by the public and the paint can still be dangerous if ingested in sufficient quantities, which is why it has been banned in many countries.\n\nRadium paint used zinc sulfide phosphor, usually trace metal doped with an activator, such as copper (for green light), silver (blue-green), and more rarely copper-magnesium (for yellow-orange light). The phosphor degrades relatively fast and the dials lose luminosity in several years to a few decades; clocks and other devices available from antique shops and other sources therefore are not luminous any more. However, due to the long 1600 year half-life of the Ra-226 isotope they are still radioactive and can be identified with a Geiger counter.\n\nThe dials can be renovated by application of a very thin layer of fresh phosphor, without the radium content (with the original material still acting as the energy source); the phosphor layer has to be thin due to the light self-absorption in the material.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, radium was progressively replaced with promethium-147. Promethium is only a relatively low-energy beta-emitter, which, unlike alpha emitters, does not degrade the phosphor lattice and the luminosity of the material does not degrade so fast. Promethium-based paints are significantly safer than radium; the half-life of Pm however, is only 2.62 years, it is therefore not too suitable for long-life applications.\n\nPromethium-based paint was used to illuminate Apollo Lunar Module electrical switch tips and painted on control panels of the Lunar Roving Vehicle.\n\nThe latest generation of the radioluminescent materials is based on tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with half-life of 12.32 years that emits very low-energy beta radiation. The devices are similar to a fluorescent tube in construction, as they consist of a hermetically sealed (usually borosilicate-glass) tube, coated inside with a phosphor, and filled with tritium. They are known under many names – e.g. gaseous tritium light source (GTLS), traser, betalight.\n\nTritium light sources are most often seen as \"permanent\" illumination for the hands of wristwatches intended for diving, nighttime, or tactical use. They are additionally used in glowing novelty keychains, in self-illuminated exit signs, and formerly in fishing lures. They are favored by the military for applications where a power source may not be available, such as for instrument dials in aircraft, compasses, lights for map reading, and sights for weapons.\n\nTritium lights are also found in some old rotary dial telephones, though due to their age they no longer produce a useful amount of light.\n\n"}

He was a second-round pick of the Detroit Lions in the 2001 NFL Draft, and played his entire 14-year career for the Lions of the National Football League (NFL). Prior to that he played college football for the University of Nebraska and earned All-American.\n\nIn June 2016, Raiola was hired by the Detroit Lions as a strength and conditioning assistant coach.\n\nRaiola was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He attended Saint Louis School in Honolulu, and played for the Saint Louis Crusaders high school football team. One of his teammates was Olin Kreutz, two years his senior. The Crusaders were undefeated in his last three years at the school; in 1996, his senior year, the team won its 11th straight Prep Bowl. That same year, St. Louis High was nationally ranked as the 15th-best team in the United States.\n\nRaiola attended the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, where he played for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team from 1998 to 2000. In his first year, he became the first freshman offensive lineman to start a game for the Cornhuskers since 1991. In 1999, he became the first sophomore center for the team since Dave Rimington to participate in postseason play, and set a school record for knockdowns, which he bettered in 2000. Following his junior season in 2000, he won the Rimington Trophy as the best center in college football, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American.\n\nRaiola was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 2001 NFL Draft in the second round. He was the highest selected Nebraska offensive lineman since Zach Wiegert in the 1995 NFL Draft, and the highest selected center since Dave Rimington in 1983. He was also the first center drafted by the Lions since Jeff Hartings in 1996.\n\nRaiola started to get game time as a replacement center in the latter half of the season in a game against the San Francisco 49ers in November; it was his first game in that position. He was selected as a member of \"Pro Football Weekly's\" All-Rookie squad during that season.\n\nIn 2002, Raiola started all 16 games of the season, winning the Chuck Hughes Most Improved Player award. He was a key member of the offensive line which allowed only 20 quarterback sacks for the season, the lowest in the NFL and then a franchise record. Raiola protected both quarterback Joey Harrington and running back James Stewart.\n\nIn 2003, Raiola was a 16-game starter and a key part of the offensive line. During that season, the offensive line allowed just 11 sacks, a new record for the franchise. He also played more special teams, and became the long snapper when Bradford Banta broke his clavicle against the San Diego Chargers.\n\nIn 2004, Raiola started at center in all 16 games. The Lions' offensive line helped the team's rushing attack to be ranked second for the seven last games of the season. He again became responsible for long snapping after Jody Littleton incurred a hamstring injury against the Washington Redskins in the middle of November. His reliability and strong performance led to the Lions offering him a five-year contract extension in March 2005.\n\nOn December 9, 2008, he was fined $7,500 by the Lions organization after he made an obscene gesture towards heckling Lions fans after Detroit fell to 0–13 with a 20–16 loss to the Minnesota Vikings at Ford Field.

The deal includes $9 million in guarantees.\n\nOn November 1, 2009, he had another small run-in with fans who were heckling rookie quarterback Matthew Stafford. Raiola had a few choice words to some fans in the stands as he defended Stafford from their jeers.\n\nFollowing the 2009 season, Raiola was named the recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association/Pro Football Writers Association's Media-Friendly \"Good Guy\" Award. The Good Guy Award is given yearly to the Detroit Lions player who shows consideration to, and cooperation with the media at all times during the course of the season.\n\nFollowing a game against the New England Patriots on November 23, 2014, the \"Detroit Free Press\" reported that Raiola admitted to taking a cheap shot at Patriots defensive tackle Zach Moore on last play of the game. The Patriots ran for a late touchdown when they could have taken three kneel-downs and ended the game with a 27–9 win over the Lions, and that decision rankled Raiola. Raiola said after the game that he tried to cut-block Moore on the Lions' final offensive snap as retaliation for the score, which resulted in an even more lopsided 34–9 loss for Detroit. \"I cut him,\" Raiola said. \"We took a knee, so I cut the nose (tackle). They went for six. They went for a touchdown at two minutes. They could have took three knees and the game could have been over. It's football. He wants to keep playing football, let's play football. Not a big deal. It's football.\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick responded during a press conference the following day, saying, \"Sure there was a lot of frustration there with Raiola. He's never beaten us. Tough day for him.\"\n\nNFL spokesman Michael Signora said the following Wednesday that Raiola was fined $10,000 for unnecessary roughness, but not for his cut block on Zach Moore on the game's final play. Instead, it was for a play against Moore earlier in the drive, when Moore beat him and Raiola appeared to try to club him from behind.\n\nIn the 2014 Thanksgiving Day game, Raiola became the first player in Detroit Lions history to start 200 games.\n\nIn December 2014, Raiola stepped on the ankle of the Chicago Bears' Ego Ferguson. The NFL suspended Raiola for one game without pay, and said that it was Raiola's sixth \"safety-related rules violation since 2010\".\n\nRaiola was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Tony and Wendy Raiola. He has a younger sister, Nicole, and a younger brother, Donovan, who played center for the Washington Redskins in 2011. His father, a native of Hawaii, was a defensive lineman for the University of Miami in the mid-1970s, but saw his career cut short due to a shoulder injury in 1977.\n\nAfter on-the-field warm-ups at the October 6, 2013, game at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, several members of the University of Wisconsin Marching Band accused Raiola of making verbal assaults including homophobic slurs and comments about the band members' weight. The Detroit Lions subsequently issued an apology to the band and reported the behavior was against team policy, but added Raiola would not be disciplined by the team. Many fans of the NFL commented that the reported apology was articulate and professional in nature and therefore was not written by Raiola but instead was written by a member of the Lions public relations staff. Raiola stated to the media that he has more important things to worry about, like wins and losses.\n\n"}

{"id": "2331947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331947", "title": "Common One", "text": "Common One\n\nCommon One is the twelfth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1980. The album was recorded over a nine-day period at Super Bear Studios, near Nice, on the French Riviera. Its title comes from the section of the song \"Summertime in England\", where Morrison sings the lyrics \"Oh, my common one with the coat so old and the light in her head\".\n\n\"Common One\" was not well received by critics. Its 2008 re-issued and re-mastered version of the album contains an alternative take of \"Haunts of Ancient Peace\" and \"When Heart is Open\".\n\nMorrison has cited \"Common One\" as his favourite of his own albums.\n\nAccording to Mick Cox the early stages of the album were rehearsed during November and December 1979. The songs \"Summertime in England\" and \"Haunts of Ancient Peace\" were rehearsed by Morrison and the band during small gigs in January 1980. Cox thought that \"some of these performances at the rehearsals were far better than the final recordings.\" Speaking of the recording sessions at Super Bear, Cox said: \"We were all ensconced in a very, very intense, highly charged situation for those eleven days, but it did bring out that album.\" Jef Labes recalled about his arrangements on the album: \"...but what I always tried to do with string arrangements for him was to just try to mimic what he was singing, 'cause he was such a song instrument.\"\n\nIn contrast to many of his previous albums, \"Common One\" ventures more into the realms of free jazz than the usual Van Morrison R&B, with the sax playing of Pee Wee Ellis coming to the fore. The songs are also somewhat longer than on his previous albums. Morrison said that the original concept was even more esoteric and was heavily influenced by his reading of nature poets.\n\nThe opening track, \"Haunts of Ancient Peace\" was named from a (1902) book by Alfred Austin (Poet Laureate 1896–1912), and features the twin brothers of Morrison's voice against the answering saxophone of Pee Wee Ellis, with the trumpet of Mark Isham.\n\n\"Summertime in England\" was the longest track and proved to be a successful live performance for some time to come. Morrison said it \"was actually a part of a poem I was writing and the poem and the song sort of merged.\" The lyrics include images of Wordsworth and Coleridge \"smokin' up in Kendal\" (Brian Hinton says they are \"smokin' with poetry not spliffs\"). It ends with the music being brought down to nothing and the words, \"Can you feel the silence?\"\n\n\"Spirit\" played with sudden tempo changes and the ending fifteen-minute track, \"When Heart is Open\" was experimental in form with no discernible melody or tempo (presaging the era of New-age music).\n\nThe album was generally not well-received upon release and some of the reviews were scathing and merciless. Graham Locke reviewed it in \"NME\" calling it \"colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality\". Dave McCullough wrote in \"Sounds\": \"For the fan, as I am myself, it's not even possible to romanticize and say that Morrison has lost his way temporarily, so stern and so acute is his departure.\" \"Rolling Stone\" critic Tom Carson named \"Satisfied\" as the record's only \"masterpiece\", in which \"the simplicity that Morrison is striving for arrive as something natural and effortless, as a gift of grace\". Clinton Heylin contends that Morrison was bruised by the reaction and \"would not attempt anything quite so ambitious again.\" In 1982, Lester Bangs argued for a reassessment, saying, \"Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics.\" \n\nAmerican critics voted it the 27th best album of 1980 in \"The Village Voice\"s annual Pazz & Jop poll. In an accompanying essay, poll supervisor Robert Christgau wrote, \"As somebody who considers \"Moondance\" an apotheosis and has never gotten \"Astral Weeks\", I think this is his worst since \"Hard Nose the Highway\" – sententious, torpid, abandoned by God. I know lots of \"Astral Weeks\" fans who agree. But Morrison has a direct line to certain souls, and they still hear him talkin'.\" In retrospect, he deemed \"Satisfied\" and \"Summer in England\" to be the record's highlights. AllMusic later wrote, \"No wonder the rock critics of the time didn't get it; this is music outside the pop mainstream, and even Morrison's own earlier musical territory. But it retains its trancelike power to this day.\" In 2009, Erik Hage said \"the dominant critical reaction represented it as prohibitive, sententious, and inaccessible, when in fact it is filled with much melody and beauty.\"\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Billboard\" (North America)\nUK Album Chart\n"}

He studied at the School of Plant Biology, University of North Wales from October 1966–Nov. 1969 and was awarded a PhD under Prof. P. Greig Smith. Ph.D.\n\nHe worked in the Biology Department at Addis Ababa University from 1963, serving as a graduate assistant, assistant lecturer, and assistant professor. He was appointed dean of the Faculty of Science in 1974, and served in this capacity until 1978, when he was appointed Associate Professor of Biology. In 1978 he also began working part time with the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission as Leader of the IDRC-UNU sponsored research project \"Research and Development in Rural Settings\".

In this time he built up a strong group of well-prepared African negotiators who began to take the lead in the G77 and China Group. Africa came out with united, strong, progressive positions, such as no patents on living materials and the recognition of community rights. This strengthened the G77 and China's negotiating positions.\n\nTewolde was instrumental in securing recommendations from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) encouraging African countries to develop and implement community rights, a common position on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, and a clear stance against patents on life. Tewolde also guided the drafting of the OAU model legislation for community rights, which is now used as the common basis for all African countries.\n\nAt the 1999 biosafety negotiations in Cartagena, Colombia, Tewolde was the spokesperson for the majority of the G77 countries, called 'the Like Minded Group'. These negotiations ended in deadlock, but reached a successful conclusion in Montreal in January 2000. Tewolde's leadership of the Like Minded Group in the negotiations played a key role in achieving an outcome against strong US and EU opposition - that protects biosafety and biodiversity and respects traditional and community rights in developing countries.\n\nTewolde Berhan is also named one of the 2006 winners of the United Nations top environmental prize, Champions of the Earth.\n\nHe is a member of the World Future Council.\n\n\n\n"}

As a teenager, he would shop for music at Gramaphone Records on Clark Street in Chicago. His brother, Rich Raddon, became an entrepreneur and film producer. He attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah from 1989 to 1990, working on his DJ skills in his dorm room. At age 19, Raddon served a two-year full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Japan. Following his mission, in 1992, he moved to Salt Lake City to attend the University of Utah, eventually graduating with a degree in communications. While attending school, Kaskade and his close friend Jodi Call ran a record store in Salt Lake City called Mechanized.\n\nIn 1995, Raddon began DJing his first monthly Monday night party at a basement venue called Club Manhattan. He used this additional income to purchase studio essentials. In May 2000, Raddon moved to San Francisco with his wife where he got a job working as an A&R assistant to John Elkins at Om Records, a house and electronic label. To Raddon's benefit, San Francisco was an emerging site of a new deep house movement. While at OM records he continued DJing and producing music. Soon after, Raddon created his alter ego, Kaskade, which his wife worried would remind people of the dish detergent.

Limbo, a three-barreled mortar similar to the earlier Squid which it superseded, was developed by the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment in the 1950s. Its mounting was stabilised in pitch and roll. Squid was loaded manually, which was difficult on a pitching deck in heavy seas with no protection from the elements; in contrast, Limbo was loaded and fired automatically with all the crew under cover. It was commonly installed on the quarterdeck of Royal Navy escort ships from 1955 to the mid-1980s. Australian–built versions of the destroyer all carried Limbo as did the Australian . Limbo was also widely employed by the Royal Canadian Navy, being incorporated into all destroyer designs from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, including the , , , and classes. Limbo was carried on the Type 12 President Class Frigates built for the South African Navy in the 1960s.\n\nThe firing distance of the mortars was controlled by opening gas vents; rounds could be fired from . The weapon was linked to the sonar system of the ship, firing on command when the target was in range. The rounds were projected so that they fell in a triangular pattern around the target. Limbo could fire in any direction around the ship and is reported to have been very accurate. The weapon was used in the 1982 Falklands War, and remained in service in the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies until the 1990s. A surviving system is preserved at Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower in Gosport, Hampshire.\n\nThe firing of the Mortar Mk 10 was controlled by the Type 170 (and later the 502) attack sonar from the Sonar Control Room (SCR), which was generally located next to the operations room in the warship.\n\nThe 170 sonar had three operators who maintained sonar contact with the target and effectively aimed the weapon in bearing, range and depth. The operators were controlled by the SC (Sonar Controller) who was in charge of the SCR.\n\nWhen a contact had been confirmed as a hostile submarine, the SC manually fired the Mortar Mk 10 from the SCR upon receiving the order from the captain in the operations room. The firing was done by means of a pistol grip and trigger mounted to the deckhead immediately behind the operators.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2331978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331978", "title": "History of Hinduism", "text": "History of Hinduism\n\nHistory of Hinduism denotes a wide variety of related religious traditions native to the Indian subcontinent. Its history overlaps or coincides with the development of religion in the Indian subcontinent since the Iron Age, with some of its traditions tracing back to prehistoric religions such as those of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. It has thus been called the \"oldest religion\" in the world. Scholars regard Hinduism as a synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder.\n\nThe history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development. The first period is the pre-Vedic period, which includes the Indus Valley Civilisation and local pre-historic religions, ending at about 1750 BCE. This period was followed in northern India by the Vedic period, which saw the introduction of the historical Vedic religion with the Indo-Aryan migrations, starting somewhere between 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE. The subsequent period, between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, is \"a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions\", and a formative period for Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Epic and Early Puranic period, from c. 200 BCE to 500 CE, saw the classical \"Golden Age\" of Hinduism (c. 320-650 CE), which coincides with the Gupta Empire. In this period the six branches of Hindu philosophy evolved, namely Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta. Monotheistic sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism developed during this same period through the Bhakti movement. The period from roughly 650 to 1100 CE forms the late Classical period or early Middle Ages, in which classical Puranic Hinduism is established, and Adi Shankara's influential consolidation of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nHinduism under both Hindu and Islamic rulers from c. 1200 to 1750 CE, saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement, which remains influential today. The colonial period saw the emergence of various Hindu reform movements partly inspired by western movements, such as Unitarianism and Theosophy. The Partition of India in 1947 was along religious lines, with the Republic of India emerging with a Hindu majority. During the 20th century, due to the Indian diaspora, Hindu minorities have formed in all continents, with the largest communities in absolute numbers in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nWestern scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions.\nAmong its roots are the historical Vedic religion, itself already the product of \"a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations\", which evolved into the Brahmanical religion and ideology of the Kuru Kingdom of Iron Age northern India; but also the Sramana or renouncer traditions of northeast India, and mesolithic and neolithic cultures of India, such as the religions of the Indus Valley Civilisation, Dravidian traditions, and the local traditions and tribal religions.\n\nAfter the Vedic period, between 500-200 BCE and c. 300 CE, at the beginning of the \"Epic and Puranic\" c.q. \"Preclassical\" period, the \"Hindu synthesis\" emerged, which incorporated śramaṇic and Buddhist influences and the emerging \"bhakti\" tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the \"smriti\" literature. This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism. During the Gupta reign the first Puranas were written, which were used to disseminate \"mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation.\" The resulting Puranic Hinduism differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmaśāstras and the \"smritis\". Hinduism co-existed for several centuries with Buddhism, to finally gain the upper hand at all levels in the 8th century.\n\nFrom northern India this \"Hindu synthesis\", and its societal divisions, spread to southern India and parts of Southeast Asia, as courts and rulers adopted the Brahmanical culture. It was aided by the settlement of Brahmins on land granted by local rulers, the incorporation and assimilation of popular non-Vedic gods, and the process of Sanskritization, in which \"people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms\". This process of assimilation explains the wide diversity of local cultures in India \"half shrouded in a taddered cloak of conceptual unity.\"\n\nJames Mill (1773–1836), in his \"The History of British India\" (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into \"ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods\", although this periodization has also received criticism.\n\nRomila Thapar notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to \"ruling dynasties and foreign invasions,\" neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity. The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim-conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth century, while the south was never completely conquered. According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on \"significant social and economic changes,\" which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers.\n\nSmart and Michaels seem to follow Mill's periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the \"ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods\" periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:\n\nThe earliest prehistoric religion in India that may have left its traces in Hinduism comes from Mesolithic as observed in the sites such as the rock paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older, as well as Neolithic times. Some of the religious practices can be considered to have originated in 4,000 BCE. Several tribal religions still exist, though \"[w]e must not assume that there are many similarities between prehistoric and contemporary tribal communities\".\n\nSome Indus valley seals show swastikas, which are found in other religions worldwide. Phallic symbols interpreted as the much later Hindu linga have been found in the Harappan remains. Many Indus valley seals show animals. One seal shows a horned figure seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position and surrounded by animals was named by early excavators \"Pashupati\", an epithet of the later Hindu gods Shiva and Rudra. Writing in 1997, Doris Meth Srinivasan said, \"Not too many recent studies continue to call the seal's figure a \"Proto-Siva,\" rejecting thereby Marshall's package of proto-Shiva features, including that of three heads. She interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man. According to Iravatham Mahadevan, symbols 47 and 48 of his Indus script glossary \"The Indus Script: Texts, Concordance and Tables\" (1977), representing seated human-like figures, could describe the South Indian deity Murugan.\n\nIn view of the large number of figurines found in the Indus valley, some scholars believe that the Harappan people worshipped a mother goddess symbolizing fertility, a common practice among rural Hindus even today.\nHowever, this view has been disputed by S. Clark who sees it as an inadequate explanation of the function and construction of many of the figurines.\n\nThere are no religious buildings or evidence of elaborate burials... If there were temples, they have not been identified. However, House - 1 in HR-A area in Mohenjadaro's Lower Town has been identified as a possible temple.\n\nThe early Dravidian religion refers to a broad range of belief systems which existed in South Asia before the arrival of Indo-Aryans. Scholars do not share a uniform consensus on early Dravidian religion but many scholars associated it with Neolithic societies of South Asia which was later assimilated into migrating Indo-Aryan society leading to formation of early Indian religious and cultural synthesis. Some scholars suggest early Dravidian religion were either historically or are at present Āgamic. and have been dated either as post-vedic or as pre-vedic compositions which were assimilated to the Vedic fold.\n\nThe commonly proposed period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to 2nd millennium BCE. Vedism was the sacrificial religion of the early Indo-Aryans, speakers of early Old Indic dialects, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian peoples of the Bronze Age who lived on the Central Asian steppes.\n\nThe Vedic period, named after the Vedic religion of the Indo-Aryans of the Kuru Kingdom, lasted from c. 1750 to 500 BCE. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-European language family, which many scholars believe originated in Kurgan culture of the Central Asian steppes. Indeed, the Vedic religion, including the names of certain deities, was in essence a branch of the same religious tradition as the ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians, and Germanic peoples. For example, the Vedic god Dyaus Pita is a variant of the Proto-Indo-European god *Dyēus phter (or simply *Dyēus), from which also derive the Greek Zeus and the Roman Jupiter. Similarly the Vedic Manu and Yama derive from the PIE *Manu and *Yemo, from which also derive the Germanic Mannus and Ymir.\n\nAccording to the Indo-European migration theory, the Indo-Iranians were the common ancestor of the Indo-Aryans and the Proto-Iranians. The Indo-Iranians split into the Indo-Aryans and Iranians around 1800-1600 BC.\n\nThe Indo-Aryans were pastoralists who migrated into north-western India after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization, The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. The roots of this culture go back further to the Sintashta culture, with funeral sacrifices which show close parallels to the sacrificial funeral rites of the \"Rig Veda\".\n\nDuring the Early Vedic period (c. 1500 - 1100 BCE) Indo-Aryan tribes were pastoralists in north-west India. After 1100 BCE, with the introduction of iron, the Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the western Ganges Plain, adapting an agrarian lifestyle. Rudimentary state-forms appeared, of which the Kuru-tribe and realm was the most influential. It was a tribal union, which developed into the first recorded state-level society in South Asia around 1000 BCE. It decisively changed their religious heritage of the early Vedic period, collecting their ritual hymns into the Veda-collections, and developing new rituals which gained their position in Indian civilization as the orthodox srauta rituals, which contributed to the so-called \"classical synthesis\" or \"Hindu synthesis\".\n\nThe Indo-Aryans brought with them their language and religion. The Indo-Aryan and Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\", which borrowed \"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\" from the Bactria–Margiana Culture. At least 383 non-Indo-European words were borrowed from this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink Soma. According to Anthony,\nThe oldest inscriptions in Old Indic, the language of the \"Rig Veda\", are found not in northwestern India and Pakistan, but in northern Syria, the location of the Mitanni kingdom. The Mitanni kings took Old Indic throne names, and Old Indic technical terms were used for horse-riding and chariot-driving. The Old Indic term r'ta, meaning \"cosmic order and truth\", the central concept of the \"Rig Veda\", was also employed in the mitanni kingdom. And Old Indic gods, including Indra, were also known in the Mitanni kingdom.\n\nTheir religion was further developed when they migrated into the Ganges Plain after c. 1100 BCE and became settled farmers, further syncretising with the native cultures of northern India. The Vedic religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions, such as the Yaksha cults, and was itself the product of \"a composite of the indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations\". David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who \"have emphatically demonstrated\" that Vedic religion is partially derived from the Indus Valley Civilizations. \n\nIts liturgy is preserved in the three Vedic Samhitas: the Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda and the Yajur-Veda. The Vedic texts were the texts of the elite, and do not necessarily represent popular ideas or practices. Of these, the Rig-Veda is the oldest, a collection of hymns composed between ca. 1500-1200 BCE. The other two add ceremonial detail for the performance of the actual sacrifice. The Atharva-Veda may also contain compositions dating to before 1000 BCE. It contains material pertinent to domestic ritual and folk magic of the period.\n\nThese texts, as well as the voluminous commentary on orthopraxy collected in the Brahmanas compiled during the early 1st millennium BCE, were transmitted by oral tradition alone until the advent, in the 4th century AD, of the Pallava and Gupta period and by a combination of written and oral tradition since then.\n\nThe Hindu samskaras\nThe earliest text of the Vedas is the Rigveda, a collection of poetic hymns used in the sacrificial rites of Vedic priesthood. Many Rigvedic hymns concern the fire ritual (Agnihotra) and especially the offering of Soma to the gods (Somayajna). Soma is both an intoxicant and a god itself, as is the sacrificial fire, Agni. The royal horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha) is a central rite in the Yajurveda.\n\nThe gods in the Rig-Veda are mostly personified concepts, who fall into two categories: the devas – who were gods of nature – such as the weather deity Indra (who is also the King of the gods), Agni (\"fire\"), Usha (\"dawn\"), Surya (\"sun\") and Apas (\"waters\") on the one hand, and on the other hand the asuras – gods of moral concepts – such as Mitra (\"contract\"), Aryaman (guardian of guest, friendship and marriage), Bhaga (\"share\") or Varuna, the supreme Asura (or Aditya). While Rigvedic \"deva\" is variously applied to most gods, including many of the Asuras, the Devas are characterised as Younger Gods while Asuras are the Older Gods (pūrve devāḥ). In later Vedic texts, the Asuras become demons.\n\nThe Rigveda has 10 Mandalas ('books'). There is significant variation in the language and style between the family books (RV books 2–7), book 8, the \"Soma Mandala\" (RV 9), and the more recent books 1 and 10. The older books share many aspects of common Indo-Iranian religion, and is an important source for the reconstruction of earlier common Indo-European traditions. Especially RV 8 has striking similarity to the Avesta, containing allusions to Afghan Flora and Fauna, e.g. to camels (\"\" = Avestan \"uštra\"). Many of the central religious terms in Vedic Sanskrit have cognates in the religious vocabulary of other Indo-European languages (\"deva\": Latin \"deus\"; \"hotar\": Germanic \"god\"; \"asura\": Germanic \"ansuz\"; \"yajna\": Greek \"hagios\"; \"brahman\": Norse \"Bragi\" or perhaps Latin \"flamen\" etc.). In the Avesta, Asura (Ahura) is considered good and Devas (Daevas) are considered evil entities, quite the opposite of the Rig Veda.\n\nEthics in the Vedas are based on the concepts of Satya and Rta. Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute. Ṛta is the expression of Satya, which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks: \nThe term \"dharma\" was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of Rta. The term rta is also known from the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples prior to the earliest Vedic (Indo-Aryan) and Zoroastrian (Iranian) scriptures. \"Asha\" (\"aša\") is the Avestan language term corresponding to Vedic language ṛta.\n\nThe 9th and 8th centuries BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads. Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Veda). The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the rituals, however, a philosophical and allegorical meaning is also given to these rituals. In some later Upanishads there is a spirit of accommodation towards rituals. The tendency which appears in the philosophical hymns of the Vedas to reduce the number of gods to one principle becomes prominent in the Upanishads. The diverse monistic speculations of the Upanishads were synthesised into a theistic framework by the sacred Hindu scripture \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\n\"Brahmanism\", also called \"Brahminism\", developed out of the Vedic religion, incorporating non-Vedic religious ideas, and expanding to a region stretching from the northwest Indian subcontinent to the Ganges valley. Brahmanism included the Vedic corpus, but also post-Vedic texts such as the \"Dharmasutras\" and \"Dharmasastras\", which gave prominence to the priestly (Brahmin) class of the society. The emphasis on ritual and the dominant position of Brahmans developed as an ideology developed in the Kuru-Pancala realm, and expanded into a wider realm after the demish of the Kuru-Pancala realm. It co-existed with local religions, such as the Yaksha cults.\n\nIn Iron Age India, during a period roughly spanning the 10th to 6th centuries BCE, the Mahajanapadas arise from the earlier kingdoms of the various Indo-Aryan tribes, and the remnants of the Late Harappan culture. In this period the \"mantra\" portions of the Vedas are largely completed, and a flowering industry of Vedic priesthood organised in numerous schools (shakha) develops exegetical literature, viz. the Brahmanas. These schools also edited the Vedic \"mantra\" portions into fixed recensions, that were to be preserved purely by oral tradition over the following two millennia.\n\nIncreasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or sramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals. Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c. 563-483 BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. According to Heinrich Zimmer, Jainism and Buddhism are part of the pre-Vedic heritage, which also includes Samkhya and Yoga:\nThe Sramana tradition in part created the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara, and the concept of liberation, which became characteristic for Hinduism.\n\nPratt notes that Oldenberg (1854-1920), Neumann (1865-1915) and Radhakrishnan (1888-1975) believed that the Buddhist canon had been influenced by Upanishads, while la Vallee Poussin thinks the influence was nihil, and \"Eliot and several others insist that on some points the Buddha was directly antithetical to the Upanishads\".\n\nThe Mauryan period saw an early flowering of classical Sanskrit Sutra and Shastra literature and the scholarly exposition of the \"circum-Vedic\" fields of the Vedanga. However, during this time Buddhism was patronised by Ashoka, who ruled large parts of India, and Buddhism was also the mainstream religion until the Gupta period.\n\nThe post-Vedic period of the Second Urbanisation saw a decline of Brahmanism. With the growth of cities, which threatened the income and patronage of the rural Brahmins; the rise of Buddhism; and the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great (327-325 BCE), the rise of the Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE), and the Saka invasions and rule of northwestern India (2nd c. BC - 4th c. CE), Brahmanism faced a grave threat to its existence. In some later texts, Northwest-India (which earlier texts consider as part of \"Aryavarta\") is even seen as \"impure\", probably due to invasions. The Karnaparva 43.5-8 states that those who live on the Sindhu and the five rivers of the Punjab are impure and dharmabahya.\n\nVedism as the religious tradition of a priestly elite was marginalised by other traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism in the later Iron Age, but in the Middle Ages would rise to renewed prestige with the Mimamsa school, which as well as all other \"astika\" traditions of Hinduism, considered them authorless (\"apaurusheyatva\") and eternal. A last surviving elements of the Historical Vedic religion or Vedism is Śrauta tradition, following many major elements of Vedic religion and is prominent in Southern India, with communities in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, but also in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states; the best known of these groups are the Nambudiri of Kerala, whose traditions were notably documented by Frits Staal.\n\nThe decline of Brahmanism was overcome by providing new services and incorporating the non-Vedic Indo-Aryan religious heritage of the eastern Ganges plain and local religious traditions, giving rise to contemporary Hinduism. Between 500–200 BCE and c. 300 CE the \"Hindu synthesis\" developed, which incorporated Sramanic and Buddhist influences and the emerging \"bhakti\" tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the \"smriti\" literature. This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nAccording to Embree, several other religious traditions had existed side by side with the Vedic religion. These indigenous religions \"eventually found a place under the broad mantle of the Vedic religion\". When Brahmanism was declining and had to compete with Buddhism and Jainism, the popular religions had the opportunity to assert themselves. According to Embree, \nThis \"new Brahmanism\" appealed to rulers, who were attracted to the supernatural powers an the practical advice Brahmis could provide, and resulted in a resurgence of Brahmanical influence, dominating Indian society since the classical Age of Hinduism in the early centuries CE. It is reflected in the process of Sanskritization, a process in which \"people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms\", a process sometimes called Sanskritization. It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts.\n\nThe Brahmins response of assimilation and consolidation is reflected in the \"smriti\" literature which took shape in this period. The \"smriti\" texts of the period between 200 BCE and 100 CE proclaim the authority of the Vedas, and acceptance of the Vedas became a central criterium for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas. Most of the basic ideas and practices of classical Hinduism derive from the new \"smriti\" literature.\n\nOf the six Hindu darsanas, the Mimamsa and the Vedanta \"are rooted primarily in the Vedic \"sruti\" tradition and are sometimes called \"smarta\" schools in the sense that they develop \"smarta\" orthodox current of thoughts that are based, like \"smriti\", directly on \"sruti\"\". According to Hiltebeitel, \"the consolidation of Hinduism takes place under the sign of \"bhakti\"\". It is the \"Bhagavadgita\" that seals this achievement. The result is an \"universal achievement\" that may be called \"smarta\". It views Shiva and Vishnu as \"complementary in their functions but ontologically identical\".\n\nThe major Sanskrit epics, \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", which belong to the \"smriti\", were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. They contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The later Puranas recount tales about devas and devis, their interactions with humans and their battles against rakshasa. The Bhagavad Gita \"seals the achievement\" of the \"consolidation of Hinduism\", integrating Brahmanic and sramanic ideas with theistic devotion.\n\nIn early centuries CE several schools of Hindu philosophy were formally codified, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta.\n\nThe Sangam literature (300 BCE – 400 CE), written in the Sangam period, is a mostly secular body of classical literature in the Tamil language. Nonetheless, there are some works, significantly Pattupathu and Paripaatal, wherein the personal devotion to God was written in the form of devotional poems. Vishnu, Shiva and Murugan were mentioned gods. These works are therefore the earliest evidence of monotheistic Bhakti traditions, preceding the large bhakti movement, which was given great attention in later times.\n\nDuring this period, power was centralised, along with a growth of near distance trade, standardization of legal procedures, and general spread of literacy. Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but orthodox Brahmana culture began to be rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty, who were Vaishnavas. The position of the Brahmans was reinforced, the first Hindu temples dedicated to the gods of the Hindu deities, emerged during the late Gupta age. During the Gupta reign the first Puranas were written, which were used to disseminate \"mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation\". The Guptas patronised the newly emerging Puranic religion, seeking legitimacy for their dynasty. The resulting Puranic Hinduism, differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmasastras and the \"smritis\".\n\nAccording to P. S. Sharma, \"the Gupta and Harsha periods form really, from the strictly intellectual standpoint, the most brilliant epocha in the development of Indian philosophy\", as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side. Charvaka, the atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India before the 8th century CE.\n\nThe Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries) saw a flowering of scholarship, the emergence of the classical schools of Hindu philosophy, and of classical Sanskrit literature in general on topics ranging from medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, to astrology and astronomy and astrophysics. The famous Aryabhata and Varahamihira belong to this age. The Gupta established a strong central government which also allowed a degree of local control. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict caste system, or class system. The peace and prosperity created under Gupta leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors.\n\nThe Pallavas (4th to 9th centuries) were, alongside the Guptas of the North, patronisers of Sanskrit in the South of the Indian subcontinent. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha. Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram, Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets, who are as famous as Kalidasa.\n\nThe practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture (see Vastu Shastra).\nThis period saw the emergence of the Bhakti movement. The Bhakti movement was a rapid growth of \"bhakti\" beginning in Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars (4th to 10th centuries CE) and the Vaisnava Alvars (3rd to 9th centuries CE) who spread \"bhakti\" poetry and devotion throughout India by the 12th to 18th centuries CE.\n\nHindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. At this time, India started to strongly influence Southeast Asian countries. Trade routes linked India with southern Burma, central and southern Siam, lower Cambodia and southern Vietnam and numerous urbanised coastal settlements were established there.\n\nFor more than a thousand years, Indian Hindu/Buddhist influence was, therefore, the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pali and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, Brahmanism and Hinduism, were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature, such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics.\n\nFrom the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful Indian colonial empires and became extremely active in Hindu and Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence.\n\nLangkasuka (-\"langkha\" Sanskrit for \"resplendent land\" -\"sukkha\" of \"bliss\") was an ancient Hindu kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula. The kingdom, along with Old Kedah settlement, are probably the earliest territorial footholds founded on the Malay Peninsula. According to tradition, the founding of the kingdom happened in the 2nd century; Malay legends claim that Langkasuka was founded at Kedah, and later moved to Pattani.\n\nFrom the 5th to 15th centuries Sri Vijayan empire, a maritime empire centred on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras. The Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the Chola rulers of India. The Majapahit Empire succeeded the Singhasari empire. It was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in maritime Southeast Asia.\n\nFunan was a pre-Angkor Cambodian kingdom, located around the Mekong delta, probably established by Mon-Khmer settlers speaking an Austroasiatic language. According to reports by two Chinese envoys, K'ang T'ai and Chu Ying, the state was established by an Indian Brahmin named Kaundinya, who in the 1st century CE was given instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat a Khmer queen, Soma. Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nagas, married Kaundinya and their lineage became the royal dynasty of Funan. The myth had the advantage of providing the legitimacy of both an Indian Brahmin and the divinity of the cobras, who at that time were held in religious regard by the inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe kingdom of Champa (or \"Lin-yi\" in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central Vietnam from approximately 192 through 1697. The dominant religion of the Cham people was Hinduism and the culture was heavily influenced by India.\n\nLater, from the 9th to the 13th century, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. Angkor was at the centre of this development, with a temple complex and urban organisation able to support around one million urban dwellers. The largest temple complex of the world, Angkor Wat, stands here; built by the king Vishnuvardhan.\n\nAfter the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with \"countless vasal states\". The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. \"The great king was remote, was exalted and deified\", as reflected in the Tantric Mandala, which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.\n\nThe disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry. Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of \"Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism\" was diminished. Rural and devotional movements arose, along with Shaivism, Vaisnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, though \"sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development\". Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords. Buddhism lost its position after the 8th century, and began to disappear in India. This was reflected in the change of puja-ceremonies at the courts in the 8th century, where Hindu gods replaced the Buddha as the \"supreme, imperial deity\".\n\nThe Brahmanism of the Dharmashastras and the \"smritis\" underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of Puranic Hinduism, \"which like a colossus striding across the religious firmanent soon came to overshadow all existing religions\". Puranic Hinduism was a \"multiplex belief-system which grew and expanded as it absorbed and synthesised polaristic ideas and cultic traditions\". It was distinguished from its Vedic Smarta roots by its popular base, its theological and sectarioan pluralism, its Tantric veneer, and the central place of \"bhakti\".\n\nThe early mediaeval Puranas were composed to disseminate religious mainstream ideology among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. With the breakdown of the Gupta empire, gifts of virgin waste-land were heaped on brahmanas, to ensure profitable agrarian exploitation of land owned by the kings, but also to provide status to the new ruling classes. Brahmanas spread further over India, interacting with local clans with different religions and ideologies. The Brahmanas used the Puranas to incorporate those clans into the agrarian society and its accompanying religion and ideology. According to Flood, \"[t]he Brahmans who followed the puranic religion became known as \"smarta\", those whose worship was based on the \"smriti\", or \"pauranika\", those based on the Puranas.\" Local chiefs and peasants were absorbed into the varna, which was used to keep \"control over the new \"kshatriyas\" and \"shudras\".\"\nThe Brahmanic group was enlarged by incorporating local subgroups, such as local priests. This also lead to stratification within the Brahmins, with some Brahmins having a lower status than other Brahmins. The use of caste worked better with the new Puranic Hinduism than with the Sramanic sects. The Puranic texts provided extensive genealogies which gave status to the new \"kshatriyas\". Buddhist myths pictured government as a contract between an elected ruler and the people. And the Buddhist \"chakkavatti\" \"was a distinct concept from the models of conquest held up to the \"kshatriyas\" and the Rajputs\".\n\nMany local religions and traditions were assimilated into puranic Hinduism. Vishnu and Shiva emerged as the main deities, together with Sakti/Deva. Vishnu subsumed the cults of Narayana, Jagannaths, Venkateswara \"and many others\". Nath:\nThe transformation of Brahmanism into Pauranic Hinduism in post-Gupta India was due to a process of acculturation. The Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. The tenets of Brahmanism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream \"Hinduism\" that overshadowed all earlier traditions.\n\nRama and Krishna became the focus of a strong \"bhakti\" tradition, which found expression particularly in the \"Bhagavata Purana\". The Krishna tradition subsumed numerous Naga, yaksa and hill and tree-based cults. Siva absorbed local cults by the suffixing of \"Isa\" or \"Isvara\" to the name of the local deity, for example, Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara. In 8th-century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas. This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThe first documented bhakti movement was founded by Karaikkal-ammaiyar. She wrote poems in Tamil about her love for Shiva and probably lived around the 6th century CE. The twelve Alvars who were Vaishnavite devotees and the sixty-three Nayanars who were Shaivite devotees nurtured the incipient bhakti movement in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDuring the 12th century CE in Karnataka, the Bhakti movement took the form of the Virashaiva movement. It was inspired by Basavanna, a Hindu reformer who created the sect of Lingayats or Shiva \"bhaktas\". During this time, a unique and native form of Kannada literature-poetry called Vachanas was born.\n\nShankara (8th century CE) consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. Shankara propounded a unified reality, in which the innermost self of a person (\"atman\") and the supernatural power of the entire world (\"brahman\") are one and the same. Perceiving the changing multiplicity of forms and objects as the final reality is regarded as \"maya\", \"illusion,\" obscuring the unchanging ultimate reality of \"brahman.\"\n\nShankara himself, and his grand-teacher Gaudapada, were influenced by Buddhism. Gaudapda took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (\"vijñapti-mātra\") and \"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation\". Gaudapada \"wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the \"Mandukya Upanishad\", which was further developed by Shankara\". Gaudapada also took over the Buddhist concept of \"ajāta\" from Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy. Shankara succeeded in reading Gaudapada's \"mayavada\" into Badarayana's \"Brahma Sutras\", \"and give it a \"locus classicus\"\", against the realistic strain of the \"Brahma Sutras\".\n\nShankara is the founder of the \"Dashanami Sampradaya\" of Hindu monasticism and \"Shanmata\" tradition of worship. Shankara is also regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smarta tradition. According to Hinduism-guide.com:\nIn modern times, due to the influence of western Orientalism and Perennialism on Indian Neo-Vedanta and Hindu nationalism, Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.\n\nHindu and also Buddhist religious and secular learning had first reached Persia in an organised manner in the 6th century, when the Sassanid Emperor Khosrau I (531–579) deputed Borzuya the physician as his envoy, to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to the Academy of Gundishapur. Burzoe had translated the Sanskrit Panchatantra. His Pahlavi version was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Moqaffa under the title of \"Kalila and Dimna\" or \"The Fables of Bidpai\".\n\nUnder the Abbasid caliphate, Baghdad had replaced Gundishapur as the most important centre of learning in the then vast Islamic Empire, wherein the traditions, as well as scholars of the latter, flourished. Hindu scholars were invited to the conferences on sciences and mathematics held in Baghdad.\n\nThough Islam came to the Indian subcontinent in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders, it started impacting Indian religions after the 10th century, and particularly after the 12th century with the establishment and then expansion of Islamic rule. Will Durant calls the Muslim conquest of India \"probably the bloodiest story in history\". During this period, Buddhism declined rapidly while Hinduism faced military-led and Sultanates-sponsored religious violence. There was a widespread practice of raids, seizure and enslavement of families of Hindus, who were then sold in Sultanate cities or exported to Central Asia. Some texts suggest a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. Starting with the 13th century, for a period of some 500 years, very few texts, from the numerous written by Muslim court historians, mention any \"voluntary conversions of Hindus to Islam\", suggesting the insignificance and perhaps rarity of such conversions. Typically enslaved Hindus converted to Islam to gain their freedom. There were occasional exceptions to religious violence against Hinduism. Akbar, for example, recognized Hinduism, banned enslavement of the families of Hindu war captives, protected Hindu temples, and abolished discriminatory Jizya (head taxes) against Hindus. However, many Muslim rulers of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, before and after Akbar, from the 12th to 18th centuries, destroyed Hindu temples and persecuted non-Muslims. As noted by Alain Daniélou:\n\nHinduism underwent profound changes, aided in part by teachers such as Ramanuja, Madhva, and Chaitanya. Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman, which the philosopher Adi Shankara consolidated a few centuries before, with emotional, passionate devotion towards the more accessible Avatars, especially Krishna and Rama. According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and the 16th century, \"certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the 'six systems' (\"saddarsana\") of mainstream Hindu philosophy.\" Michaels notes that a historicization emerged which preceded later nationalism, articulating ideas which glorified Hinduism and the past.\n\n\"Eastern Ganga\" and \"Surya\" were Hindu polities, which ruled much of present-day Odisha (historically known as Kalinga) from 11th century till mid-16th century CE. During the 13th and 14th centuries, when large parts of India were under the rule of Muslim powers, an independent Kalinga became a stronghold of Hindu religion, philosophy, art, and architecture. The Eastern Ganga rulers were great patrons of religion and the arts, and the temples they built are considered among the masterpieces of Hindu architecture.\n\nThe fall of Vijayanagar Empire to Muslim rulers had marked the end of Hindu imperial assertions in the Deccan. But, taking advantage of an over-stretched Mughal Empire (1526–1857), Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the Maratha Empire, from 1674 to 1818.\n\nThe Vijayanagar Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty, which originated as a political heir of the Hoysala Empire, Kakatiya Empire, and the Pandyan Empire. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the south Indian powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. According to one narrative, the empire's founders Harihara Raya I and Bukka Raya I were two brothers in the service of the Kampili chief. After Kampili fell to the Muslim invasion, they were taken to Delhi and converted to Islam. They were sent back to Kampili as the Delhi Sultan's vassals. After gaining power in the region, they approached Vidyaranya, who converted them back to the Hindu faith.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show. The kings used titles such as \"Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya\" (literally, \"protector of cows and Brahmins\") and \"Hindurayasuratrana\" (lit. \"upholder of Hindu faith\") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress. The empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout Shaivas (worshippers of Shiva), but made grants to the Vaishnava order of Sringeri with Vidyaranya as their patron saint, and designated \"Varaha\" (the boar, an avatar of Vishnu) as their emblem. Over one-fourth of the archaeological dig found an \"Islamic Quarter\" not far from the \"Royal Quarter\". Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara. The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord Venkateshwara (Vishnu) at Tirupati. A Sanskrit work, \"Jambavati Kalyanam\" by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha \"Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani\" (\"protective jewel of Karnata Empire\"). The kings patronised the saints of the dvaita order (philosophy of dualism) of Madhvacharya at Udupi.\nThe Bhakti (devotional) movement was active during this time, and involved well known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time. Like the Virashaiva movement of the 12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the \"Vyasakuta\" and \"Dasakuta\", the former being required to be proficient in the Vedas, Upanishads and other Darshanas, while the \"Dasakuta\" merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language to the people in the form of devotional songs (\"Devaranamas\" and \"Kirthanas\"). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vyasatirtha, Vadirajatirtha and others. Vyasatirtha, the \"guru\" (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, Purandaradasa (Father of Carnatic music) and Kanakadasa earned the devotion of King Krishnadevaraya. The king considered the saint his \"Kuladevata\" (family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this time, another great composer of early carnatic music, Annamacharya composed hundreds of \"Kirthanas\" in Telugu at Tirupati in present-day Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor. The empire reached its peak during the rule of Sri Krishnadevaraya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya.\n\nVijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the Battle of Talikota (1565). After the death of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur Sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee – all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.\n\nThe official state religion of Mughal India was Islam, with the preference to the jurisprudence of the Hanafi Madhhab (Mazhab). Hinduism remained under strain during Babur and Humanyun's reigns. Sher Shah Suri, the Afghan ruler of North India was comparatively non-repressive. Hinduism came to fore during the three-year rule of Hindu ruler Hemu Vikramaditya during 1553–1556 when he had defeated Akbar at Agra and Delhi and had taken up the reign from Delhi as a Hindu 'Vikramaditya' after his 'Rajyabhishake' or coronation at Purana Quila in Delhi. However, during Mughal history, at times, subjects had the freedom to practise any religion of their choice, though non-Muslim able-bodied adult males with income were obliged to pay the jizya, which signified their status as dhimmis.\nAkbar, the Mughal emperor Humayun's son and heir from his Sindhi queen Hameeda Banu Begum, had a broad vision of Indian and Islamic traditions. One of Emperor Akbar's most unusual ideas regarding religion was Din-i-Ilahi (Faith of God), which was an eclectic mix of Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism and Christianity. It was proclaimed the state religion until his death. These actions, however, met with stiff opposition from the Muslim clergy, especially the Sufi Shaykh Alf Sani Ahmad Sirhindi. Akbar's abolition of poll-tax on non-Muslims, acceptance of ideas from other religious philosophies, toleration of public worship by all religions and his interest in other faiths showed an attitude of considerable religious tolerance, which, in the minds of his orthodox Muslim opponents, were tantamount to apostasy. Akbar's imperial expansion acquired many Hindu states, many of whom were Hindu Rajputs, through vassalage. The Rajput vassals maintained semi-autonomy in running religious affairs. Many Hindu Rajput vassals built monumental Hindu temples during the period, such as Chaturbhuj Temple and Lakshmi Temple at Orchha, by the Mughal vassal, the Hindu Rajput Orchha State.\n\nAkbar's son, Jahangir, half Rajput, was also a religious moderate, his mother being Hindu. The influence of his two Hindu queens (the Maharani Maanbai and Maharani Jagat) kept religious moderation as a centre-piece of state policy which was extended under his son, Emperor Shah Jahan, who was by blood 75% Rajput and less than 25% Moghul.\nReligious orthodoxy would only play an important role during the reign of Shah Jahan's son and successor, Aurangzeb, a devout Sunni Muslim. Aurangzeb was comparatively less tolerant of other faiths than his predecessors had been; and has been subject to controversy and criticism for his policies that abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism, citing his introduction of the jizya tax, doubling of custom duties on Hindus while abolishing it for Muslims, destruction of Hindu temples, forbidding construction and repairs of some non-Muslim temples, and the executions of Maratha ruler Sambhaji and the ninth Sikh guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, and his reign saw an increase in the number and importance of Islamic institutions and scholars. He led many military campaigns against the remaining non-Muslim powers of the Indian subcontinent – the Sikh states of Punjab, the last independent Hindu Rajputs and the Maratha rebels – as also against the Shia Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan. He also virtually stamped out, from his empire, open proselytisation of Hindus and Muslims by foreign Christian missionaries, who remained successfully active, however, in the adjoining regions: the present day Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa.\n\nThe Hindu Marathas long had lived in the Desh region around Satara, in the western portion of the Deccan plateau, where the plateau meets the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats mountains. They had resisted incursions into the region by the Muslim Mughal rulers of northern India. Under their ambitious leader Shivaji, the Maratha freed themselves from the Muslim sultans of Bijapur to the southeast and, becoming much more aggressive, began to frequently raid Mughal territory, eventually sacking the wealthy Mughal port of Surat in 1664. After substantial territorial gains, Shivaji was proclaimed 'Chhatrapati' (Emperor) in 1674; the Marathas had spread and conquered much of central India by Shivaji's death in 1680. Subsequently, under the able leadership of Brahmin prime ministers (Peshwas), the Maratha Empire reached its zenith; Pune, the seat of Peshwas, flowered as a centre of Hindu learning and traditions. The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan ) in the north, and Bengal and Andaman Islands in the east. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa Madhavrao I's Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India.\n\nIn 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan. Ten years after Panipat, the Peshwa Madhavrao I's Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India. In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, he gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, which created a confederacy of Maratha states. They became known as the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of the Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar & Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which became the First Anglo-Maratha War. The Marathas remained the preeminent power in India until their defeat in the Second Anglo-Maratha War which left the East India Company in control of most of India.\n\nKing Prithvi Narayan Shah, the last Gorkhali monarch, self-proclaimed the newly unified Kingdom of Nepal as Asal Hindustan (\"Real Land of Hindus\") due to North India being ruled by the Islamic Mughal rulers. The proclamation was done to enforce Hindu social code Dharmashastra over his reign and refer to his country as being inhabitable for Hindus. He also referred Northern India as \"Mughlan\" (Country of Mughals) and called the region infiltrated by Muslim foreigners.\n\nAfter the Gorkhali conquest of Kathmandu valley, King Prithvi Narayan Shah expelled the Christian Capuchin missionaries from Patan and revisioned Nepal as \"Asal Hindustan\" (\"real land of Hindus\"). The Hindu Tagadharis, a Nepalese Hindu socio-religious group, were given the privileged status in the Nepalese capital thereafter. Since then Hinduisation became the significant policy of the Kingdom of Nepal. Professor Harka Gurung speculates that the presence of Islamic Mughal rule and Christian British rule in India had compelled the foundation of Brahmin Orthodoxy in Nepal for the purpose building a haven for Hindus in the Kingdom of Nepal.\n\nPortuguese missionaries had reached the Malabar Coast in the late 15th century, made contact with the St Thomas Christians in Kerala and sought to introduce the Latin Rite among them. Since the priests for St Thomas Christians were served by the Eastern Christian Churches, they were following Eastern Christian practices at that time. Throughout this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. This led to the formation of the Latin Catholics in Kerala.\n\nThe Goa Inquisition was the office of the Christian Inquisition acting in the Indian city of Goa and the rest of the Portuguese empire in Asia. St. Francis Xavier, in a 1545 letter to John III, requested for an Inquisition to be installed in Goa. It was installed eight years after the death of Francis Xavier in 1552. Established in 1560 and operating until 1774, this highly controversial institution was aimed primarily at Hindus and wayward new converts.\n\nThe Battle of Plassey would see the emergence of the British as a political power; their rule later expanded to cover much of India over the next hundred years, conquering all of the Hindu states on the Indian subcontinent, with the exception of the Kingdom of Nepal. While the Maratha Empire remained the preeminent power in India, making it the last remaining Hindu empire, until their defeat in the Second Anglo-Maratha War which left the East India Company in control of most of India; as noted by acting Governor-General Charles Metcalfe, after surveying and analyzing the conditions in India, in 1806 wrote: \"India contains no more than two great powers, British and Mahratta.\" During this period, Northeastern India was divided into many kingdoms, most notable being the Kingdom of Manipur, which ruled from their seat of power at Kangla Fort and developed a sophisticated Hindu Gaudiya Vaishnavite culture, later the kingdom became a princely state of the British. The Kingdom of Mysore was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War by the British East India Company, leading to the reinstatement of the Hindu Wadiyar dynasty in Mysore as a princely states. In 1817, the British went to war with the Pindaris, raiders who were based in Maratha territory, which quickly became the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the British government offered its protection to the mainly Hindu Rajput rulers of Rajputana from the Pindaris and the Marathas. The mainly Hindu Palaiyakkarar states emerged from the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, and were a bastion of Hindu resistance; and managed to weather invasions and survive till the advent of the British. From 1799 to 1849, the Sikh Empire, ruled by members of the Sikh religion, emerged as the last major indigenous power in the Northwest of the Indian subcontinent under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, alienating Hindu vassals and Wazirs, and leading to the conflict with the British East India Company, marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British. The entire subcontinent fell under British rule (partly indirectly, via princely states) following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nWith the onset of the British Raj, the colonization of India by the British, there also started a Hindu Renaissance in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west. Indology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max Müller and John Woodroffe. They brought Vedic, Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western orientalist searched for the \"essence\" of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas, and meanwhile creating the notion of \"Hinduism\" as a unified body of religious praxis and the popular picture of 'mystical India'. This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by Hindu reform movements as the Brahmo Samaj, which was supported for a while by the Unitarian Church, together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, the idea that all religions share a common mystic ground. This \"Hindu modernism\", with proponents like Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan, became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of new religious movements, partly inspired by the European Romanticism, nationalism, scientific racism and esotericism (Theosophy) popular at the time (while conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on European culture with Orientalism, \"Hindoo style\" architecture, reception of Buddhism in the West and similar). According to Paul Hacker, \"the ethcial values of Neo-Hinduism stem from Western philosophy and Christianity, although they are expressed in Hindu terms.\"\n\nThese reform movements are summarised under Hindu revivalism and continue into the present.\n\nAn important development during the British colonial period was the influence Hindu traditions began to form on Western thought and new religious movements. An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was Arthur Schopenhauer who in the 1850s advocated ethics based on an \"Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest\", as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly \"Jewish\" spirit. Helena Blavatsky moved to India in 1879, and her Theosophical Society, founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.\n\nThe sojourn of Vivekananda to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission, a Hindu missionary organisation still active today.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include Maximiani Portaz – an advocate of \"Aryan Paganism\" – who styled herself \"Savitri Devi\" and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, founder of the German Faith Movement. It was in this period, and until the 1920s, that the swastika became a ubiquitous symbol of good luck in the West before its association with the Nazi Party became dominant in the 1930s.\n\nHinduism-inspired elements in Theosophy were also inherited by the spin-off movements of Ariosophy and Anthroposophy and ultimately contributed to the renewed New Age boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term \"New Age\" itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888 \"The Secret Doctrine\".\n\nInfluential 20th-century Hindus were Ramana Maharshi, B.K.S. Iyengar, Paramahansa Yogananda, Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON), Sri Chinmoy, Swami Rama and others who translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, raising the profiles of Yoga and Vedanta in the West and attracting followers and attention in India and abroad.\n\nHinduism is followed by around 960 million people in India. Other significant populations are found in Nepal (23 million), Bangladesh (15 million) and the Indonesian island of Bali (3.9 million). The majority of the Vietnamese Cham people also follow Hinduism, with the largest proportion in Ninh Thuận Province.\n\nIn modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indian and western understanding of Hinduism via Neo-Vedanta. Vivekananda was an advocate of Smarta-views, and Radhakrishnan was himself a Smarta-Brahman. According to iskcon.org,\n\nInfluential in spreading Hinduism to a western audience were Swami Vivekananda, Paramahansa Yogananda, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (Hare Krishna movement), Sri Aurobindo, Meher Baba, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (Transcendental Meditation), Jiddu Krishnamurti, Sathya Sai Baba, Mother Meera, among others.\n\nIn the 20th century, Hinduism also gained prominence as a political force and a source for national identity in India. With origins traced back to the establishment of the Hindu Mahasabha in the 1910s, the movement grew with the formulation and development of the Hindutva ideology in the following decades; the establishment of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925; and the entry, and later success, of RSS offshoots Jana Sangha and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in electoral politics in post-independence India. Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubnotes\nPrint\n\n\nWeb\n\n"}

Featuring two teams from the Arena Football League's Southern Division, the game went as a Southern Division game might be expected to: a low-scoring, largely defensive struggle. In the end, however, Orlando Predator kicker David Cool converted a 19-yard field goal as time expired to give the Predators a 41-38 victory over the Nashville Kats and their second ArenaBowl title in three years.\n\nThe Orlando Predators got out to a fast start in ArenaBowl XIV, opening the game with a safety and following with a pair of touchdowns to take a 15-0 lead. Though Nashville quarterback Andy Kelly would soon connect with Jeff Russell to pull within 15-7, Predators quarterback Connell Maynor answered with two more touchdown passes of his own, putting Orlando ahead 29-7 with 10 minutes to play in the first half. The score remained that way for nearly eight minutes until Nashville's William Gaines recorded a safety, seemingly awakening the Kats and beginning a furious comeback.\n\nKelly threw for two touchdowns in the final minute of the first half, pulling the Kats within six at halftime, and took a 30-29 lead by opening the second half with a touchdown pass to lineman James Baron. A field goal by Orlando's David Cool was followed by a touchdown pass from Maynor to Bret Cooper (though, critically, Cool missed the extra point), giving the Predators a 38-30 advantage early in the fourth quarter. Nashville's momentum was further slowed by the loss of Kelly, who left with a knee injury and was replaced by rookie backup James Brown. Brown threw an interception on his first possession but, after Cool missed a 22-yard field goal, quickly atoned for the mistake by finding Darryl Hammond for a 45-yard score, and connected with Cory Fleming for the two-point conversion, tying the game at 38 with 6:26 to play. Defense again took over as the game went scoreless until the Predators drove down the field to set up a potentially game-winning 19-yard field goal by Cool as time expired.

In each case, readers were advised that the magazine's lyrics could be sung \"to the tune of\" the original compositions' titles. Following the magazine's publication, several music corporations sued E.C. Publications, Inc. (the publisher of \"Mad\" magazine) over 25 of the 57 parodies.

The court ruled in E.C.'s favor on all but two of the parodies—\"There's No Business Like No Business\" and \"Always\"—whose lyrics were considered to revolve around the key words \"business\" and \"always,\" and thus hewed too closely to the originals. For those two songs, the court denied summary relief to both parties. The other 23 parodies, such as \"Louella Schwartz...\", \"The First Time I Saw Maris\" and \"The Horse That I'm Betting,\" were judged sufficiently distinct to qualify under \"fair use.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit, which ruled in \"Mad\"'s favor for \"all\" 25 songs, not just the 23 that had been cleared by the trial court. In his decision, Circuit Court Judge Irving Kaufman wrote:\nThe music companies sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to grant certiorari and so sustained the circuit court's ruling.\n\nFollowing the ruling, \"Mad\" went on to publish many hundreds of song parodies over the decades, including paperback collections. In 2009, the magazine's most prolific rhyming parodist, Frank Jacobs, appeared in the sixth chapter of the PBS documentary \"Make 'em Laugh: The Funny Business of America\" singing \"Blue Cross,\" his parody of Berlin's \"Blue Skies\" (and health insurance) that had appeared in the original 1961 collection.\n\nWritten by Irving Berlin: \nWritten by Jerome Kern: \nWritten by Cole Porter: \nWritten by Richard Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart or Oscar Hammerstein II: \n\nThe plaintiffs held the publishing rights to 30 of the 57 songs that had been parodied by \"Mad\". Other than the six parodies specifically cited in the two judges' rulings -- \"The First Time I Saw Maris\", \"Louella Schwartz Describes Her Malady\", \"I Swat You Hard on the Skin\", \"Blue Cross\", \"Always\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\"—it is unclear which 19 of the plaintiffs' remaining 24 songs were in dispute.\n\nFrank Jacobs wrote 23 of the parodies, whose topics ranged from nuclear physics to automation to the Philadelphia Phillies. Larry Siegel wrote another 23, on subjects from overcrowded classrooms to the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy debate to books about Hitler. The remaining 11 song parodies were credited to \"The Editors.\" All of Jacobs' contested parodies were later included in the 2015 book collection \"MAD's Greatest Writers: Frank Jacobs\".\n\n"}

They continue somewhat to the south in Westchester County and Rockland County, respectively.\n\nNorth to south they fall between Newburgh Bay and Haverstraw Bay, the latter forming the northern region of the New York - New Jersey Highlands.\n\nThe Hudson River enters this region in the south at Dunderberg Mountain near Stony Point, and from the north in the vicinity of Breakneck Ridge and Storm King Mountain near Cornwall, New York. These highlands played a significant role in America's military, cultural and environmental history.\n\nThe bedrock of the Highlands is part of the Reading Prong and more than a billion years old, formed during the Grenville Orogeny. It represents the very core of the Appalachian range, which has been formed by successive mountain-building events (orogenies). The present mountains have been exposed by the process of isostasy through the late Cenozoic Era. The hills were given their rounded form when glaciers cut through the Appalachian Mountains here. The Highlands are among the lowest summits in that range, and the Appalachian Trail reaches its lowest elevation in the Trailside Zoo between Bear Mountain State Park and Bear Mountain Bridge. Conversely, the river becomes narrower and deeper through the Highlands, reaching its deepest point of 216 feet (66 m), near Garrison. Many stretches are challenging to navigate, earning nicknames like \"World's End.\"\n\nPrior to European exploration, the Hudson highlands were inhabited by Native American Lenape people. Henry Hudson and his crew on the \"Half Moon\" were the first known to see the Highlands when they explored the river in 1609.\n\nThe mountains became strategically important during the American Revolutionary War, when it was important for the Continental Army to hold the river valley and prevent the British from cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. During the Revolutionary War, to prevent British shipping from using the river, the Hudson River Chain was forged at an iron works in Orange County, New York. From 1778 to 1782, the chain was stretched across the river from the Fort Clinton at West Point. The site of the fort is today the easternmost point of the grounds of the United States Military Academy.\n\nSeveral decades after independence, Thomas Cole started an artistic movement by painting America's wild and rugged landscapes— especially, at first, the Highlands— with the stark contrasts and shadows they offered, in a way that suggested raw nature, a world reborn. After the movement had faded, a critic derisively referred to the movement as the Hudson River School; the name stuck as the label for the new nation's first homegrown artistic movement.\n\nIn the early 20th century, in response to damage caused by quarrymen and loggers in the Highlands, local conservationists began to press for public ownership of the area's woods and mountains. Their efforts paid off in the first of several state parks that now blanket the chain.\n\nLater that century, an ambitious power-generating plan that would have dug into Storm King Mountain led to a landmark lawsuit by environmental groups that made history when the judge ruled that aesthetic impacts of such large projects could be considered and that a coalition of citizen groups had legal standing. This landmark lawsuit formed the basis for a large body of case law concerning environmentalism.\n\nEast (north to south)\n\nWest (north to south)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332031", "title": "Dimitris Salpingidis", "text": "Dimitris Salpingidis\n\nDimitris Salpingidis ( ; born 18 August 1981) is a former Greek professional footballer who played as a winger or a striker. He was known to be \"a very quick and useful tool on the counter attack.\"\n\nBorn in Zagliveri, Salpingidis started out as a Greco-Roman wrestler before discovering his calling in football. Salpingidis started his career through the youth ranks of PAOK FC. Before football Salpingidis was participating in wrestling in which he was very good at, with a dream of competing in the Olympics. He didn't make it as a wrestler but his dream came true as footballer in 2004. On 30 September 1999 he marked his official debut against FC Lokomotivi Tbilisi with a goal in a 2–0 win. Acknowledging his potential and in order to gain much needed experience, the team soon loaned him for two successive seasons to Kavala FC where he finished top scorer of the Second Division. His plea for a return to PAOK FC was granted by his mentor, Angelos Anastasiadis and he became an integral part of the team. On 25 August 2002 he made his league debut for PAOK in a 4–1 win against Panathinaikos. He scored his first league goal in 2-3 away win against OFI Crete.\n\nDespite playing out of position as a right midfielder he managed to earn a place in the starting line-up, just a few months after returning from loan. Plagued with financial problems, the next season saw the club experiencing an exodus of its top players such as striker Ioannis Okkas and ex-Newcastle United forward Giorgos Georgiadis, Salpingidis, at the age of 21, then became first-choice striker and captain of the team. The 2003–2004 season proved to be the best in many years, as the club finished an unexpected 3rd, qualifying for the Champions league, despite running on a very low budget. His significance for PAOK FC was such that in the summer 2004 he was given permission to miss a match with the Greek Olympic team so that he could participate in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers against Maccabi Tel Aviv. The elimination at the hands of the Israeli team, followed by the sack of coach Anastasiadis and subsequent financial turmoil hit the team badly, resulting in his exodus less than 2 years later. In the 2005–06 season he was top-scorer in the league with 17 goals.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, as the club's president Giannis Goumenos was desperate to cash in, he was openly chased by Olympiacos, AEK and Panathinaikos. Salpingidis publicly refused the offer of bitter rivals Olympiacos despite being the most profiting one among the three. On 16 August, after a lengthy negotiation period, he finally agreed to sign a four-year contract to Panathinaikos. He transferred for a fee of €1.8 million, with PAOK additionally receiving 3 players (Sandor Torghelle, Kostas Chalarambidis and Athanasios Tsigas). This was the third most expensive transfer between Greek teams at that time, estimated at €5 million. This transfer caused heavy turmoil amid PAOK fans, branding Salpingidis a traitor and ungrateful to the pains they had taken to keep him in the club. This tense situation brought about the demise of Goumenos' troubled presidency soon after. His debut with Panathinaikos was on 20 August 2006 in an away win with 4–1 against Aigalaio where he scored three goals.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Salpingidis was a key player during the victorious march to the Greek championship.\n\nAfter four very successful seasons with Panathinaikos (including a double-winning 2009–2010 season), in the summer of 2010 Salpingidis joined PAOK once again. On 16 June 2010, it was officially announced that he signed a four-year contract with PAOK FC, after his contract with Panathinaikos had expired. This club means everything for him as he explained : \"\"I first played for the club in the 1990s and I feel very good there. My whole family and my childhood friends live in the town and I'm playing football for a team with big ambitions. PAOK are one of a select group of clubs with the most fanatical supporters in Europe. Throughout the whole of the north of Greece, people live for the team alone and nothing else.\"\"\n\nOn 9 January 2011, he scored his 100th goal in the Greek Superleague against Asteras Tripoli with a header. On 3 November 2011, Salpingidis became the Greek player with the most goals in Europe. On 30 November he scored a header, beating Heurelho Gomes, in a 2–1 win against Tottenham Hotspur F.C. at White Hart Lane, after a cross from Giorgios Georgiadis, in the Europa League.\n\nIn the start of the 2012–13 season he changed his squad number from 9 to his favourite 14. On July 2012,\nFortuna Düsseldorf are in the process of trying to sign Dimitris Salpingidis from PAOK. The newly promoted Bundesliga side's general manager, Werner Wolf, claimed last week that there would be no more new arrivals at the Esprit Arena before the start of the 2012–13 campaign. However, \"Goal.com\" has learned that Fortuna are currently trying to agree a fee with PAOK for Salpingidis, who was one of the stars of Greece's surprise run to the quarter-finals of Euro 2012. The versatile attacker is on a net salary of €800,000 with his hometown club and Fortuna are not in a position to match those terms. However, they are prepared to make Salpingidis one of their highest earners and it is believed that the player is willing to take a pay cut in order to at last try his luck in the Bundesliga, having been often linked with a move to Germany in recent seasons.\n\nIn the late February and early March 2013 he was in superb form scoring 6 goals in 4 matches. On 17 March 2013 he put pen to paper on a 4-year deal to stay at the club until 2017, hoping to finish his career with his beloved team.\nHe scored two scissor kicks on 23 February 2013 against Kerkyra in a 3–1 home win. On 20 March 2013 he assumed the team captaincy after Pablo Garcia left the club. For the first time in his career, he received a red card in an away match against Platanias in which PAOK won 1–2. On 17 April 2013 he went on to score the winning goal in a thrilling 2–1 victory over Asteras Tripoli in the first leg of the Greek Cup semi-finals.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, Dimitris Salpingidis takes the field in PAOK FC's final Group L game, at home to AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, making his 67th appearance in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League. Not a particularly attractive number, but one that carries a certain significance for the 32-year-old forward since it will move him up to fourth place in the competition's all-time appearances list. Two more in the round of 32 would take him level with FC Internazionale Milano's two-time UEFA Cup-winning goalkeeper Walter Zenga in third. Moreover, a third group stage goal this season would lift him to seventh in the overall scorers rankings on 24 goals, alongside Mladen Petrić and Claudio Pizarro. The tournament has played a significant role in Salpingidis's career; his maiden goal for PAOK came on his first-team debut when he was introduced as a substitute for Zisis Vryzas – now PAOK's president – in a UEFA Cup game against FC Lokomotivi Tbilisi on 30 September 1999. Meanwhile, his 100th goal for the 'Two-Headed Eagle Of The North' arrived in PAOK's first meeting with AZ of the current campaign. Oddly enough, both landmark goals were scored under Dutch coaches: Arie Haan in 1999 and Huub Stevens in 2013.\n\nOn 26 April 2014, Salpingidis unsuccessfully tried to win his second trophy with PAOK in the Greek Cup final against Panathinaikos. PAOK settled, though, and with half-time their forward forays began to carry real menace. Salpingidis had twice gone close to an equaliser, rattling the bar with a header, and, right before the interval, was millimetres away from turning in Miroslav Stoch's cross with the goal at his mercy. Eventually his club defeated by 1-4.\n\nThe 2014–15 season did not start well for the Greek international. Dimitris Salpingidis has an additional year contract with the club, but there are a few problems appeared in the season and it seems that the final discussion will take place at the end of it. On 29 May 2015, just before the Superleague Greece play-offs, the international striker made a special program due to the discomfort in his operated toe, but could not be ready to help his club in the remaining games. Salpingidis is added to the list of players who missed this season, having to play since mid-March. The 34-year-old striker was not in his best physical condition, but Giorgos Georgiadis, coach of PAOK hoped that he could be able to give some solutions, mainly because of his experience. Salpingidis will be ready to help his teammates from the beginning of next season.\n\nOn 24 August 2015, PAOK and Dimitris Salpingidis have gone their separate ways. The 34-year-old winger's contract with the Greek club has been terminated.\n\nSalpingidis has made 82 appearances and scored 13 times for the Greece national football team, including the winning goal in the away leg of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-offs against Ukraine, which sent Greece through to the final tournament. He made his debut for the national team on 17 August 2005 against Belgium.\nOn 17 June 2010, in a 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Nigeria, he scored Greece's first ever World Cup goal with a shot from outside the area deflected off in Lukman Haruna.\nOn 8 June 2012, Salpingidis came on as a substitute and scored Greece's first goal in the Euro 2012 tournament, in the opening match, a 1–1 draw against Poland, becoming the first ever Greek player who scored in both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro. \nLater in the quarterfinals against Germany, he assisted Giorgos Samaras' goal and also scored the last goal with a penalty against Manuel Neuer, a match that ended 4–2, resulting Germany proceeding to the semi-finals.\n\nSalpingidis’ next goal is to reach new international heights in Brazil three months from now, with Colombia, Japan and Côte d'Ivoire awaiting Greece as Group C opponents. \"“Of course, my team-mates and I are already very excited,”\" he explained. \"“We can’t wait – it’s the biggest and best tournament in the world, and it’ll be a huge football party. Every child dreams of playing at a World Cup.”\" The forward continued: \"“I hope I can enjoy it. We were in South Africa four years ago and won the first World Cup match in our history there, but we went out after the group stage. This time, our aim is to reach the last 16. We’re in a finely balanced group with no major favourites. It won’t be easy, but we can do it.”\" Yet Salpingidis, who with four goals from nine games was his country’s second-highest scoring player in qualifying, does not want to hog the spotlight. \"“I’m nothing special in the team, just a part in the machine,”\" he stressed. \"“We don’t have any huge stars; we’re all the same and all have one target.”\"\n\nPAOK\n\nPanathinaikos\n\n\n"}

He wrote and spoke about many issues including apartheid, civil rights, economics, foreign policy, journalistic control and ethics, and medicine. While attending the London School of Economics in the 1960s Schechter became an anti-apartheid activist and made trips to South Africa on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC). Later he would help musician Steven Van Zandt assemble other performers to form Artists United Against Apartheid who released the album \"Sun City\" in 1985. Schechter produced and directed six nonfiction films about Nelson Mandela from the time Mandela was a political prisoner to his election and service as President of South Africa.\n\nSchechter's first job in media was with WBCN-FM in Boston, Massachusetts during the 1970s where he became known as \"Danny Schechter, the news dissector\", a nickname that stuck throughout his life. He continued to work in media with ABC and the start-up cable television news station CNN until he abandoned corporate media and founded TV and film production company Globalvision with his friend and longtime associate Rory O'Connor. Globalvision produced \"South Africa Now\" which was a television show that focused on the anti-apartheid struggle and news and culture from South Africa. He authored over 14 books.\n\nSchechter was born in New York City, in 1942. His mother, Ruth Lisa Schechter (née Lubin), was a secretary and a published poet; his father, Jerry Schechter, was a garment center pattern maker and a sculptor. Grandson of Russian Jewish immigrant socialists, Schechter grew up in the Bronx, in the garment union-sponsored Amalgamated housing cooperative development. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School, and graduated in 1964 from Cornell University, where he wrote for the \"Cornell Daily Sun\" and was a member of the Quill and Dagger society. He later received a master's degree from the London School of Economics and an honorary doctorate from Fitchburg State University.\n\nDuring his time in London, Schechter met Ruth First and other anti-apartheid activists. He joined the African National Congress (ANC) as a part of the organization's \"London Recruits\", who were tasked with entering South Africa undetected by authorities and conveying communication between exiled members of the ANC and members still in South Africa. While in South Africa Schechter attended the funeral of Albert Lutuli who was the President of the African National Congress from 1952 to 1967.\n\nSchechter was a civil rights worker and the communications director of the Northern Student Movement, and served as a community organizer in a War on Poverty program. He also worked as an assistant to the Mayor of Detroit in 1966.\n\nHe was a Nieman Fellow in Journalism at Harvard University, where he taught in 1969, and an adjunct professor at the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.\n\nHis media career began at Boston radio station WBCN-FM where he would start his show with the line, \"This is Danny Schechter, your news dissector\". The nickname was given to him by accident as he was introduced on-air by a colleague as \"the news inspector, the news digester, the news dissector\". Schechter recalled, 'news dissector' that sounded pretty unique and good, so I basically latched onto it\". He would eventually rise to the position of news director for WBCN-FM. Dissecting the news to Schechter meant he reported on the facts of a story, laid the background for the issue and then asserted why media outlets failed to accurately report on the story. Schechter described himself as \"a participatory journalist, a down-with-the-movement reporter, a manic media maven.\" Among his many interviews was one with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in June 1973.\n\nSchechter joined the start-up staff at CNN as a producer and later was a producer for the ABC newsmagazine \"20/20\", responsible for 50 segments of the program; he won two Emmy Awards and was nominated for two others including for a 1983 investigation of President Reagan's plans to fight and recover from all-out nuclear war co-produced with Bill Lichtenstein.\n\nSchechter assisted musician Steven Van Zandt and record producer Arthur Baker in creating Artists United Against Apartheid, which was a group of musicians who released a protest album in 1985 entitled \"Sun City\".\nAfter working in corporate media Schechter decided to found Globalvision, a New York City-based television and film production company, with Rory O'Connor. There Schechter created and executive-produced the series \"South Africa Now\". According to O'Connor the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) declined to distribute the program because of its anti-apartheid advocacy. However, Globalvision circumnavigated PBS and went directly to individual public television stations where it was carried in over 150 markets. Crew for \"South Africa Now\" were banned from South Africa itself, which made production of the show more difficult.\n\nSchechter and O'Connor later co-produced \"Rights & Wrongs: Human Rights Television\", which aired on American public television stations and in over 60 countries from 1992 to 1996. He was the recipient of the Society of Professional Journalists' 2001 Award for Excellence in Documentary Journalism. Schechter's film \"WMD: Weapons of Mass Deception\" won the Austin Film Festival's Documentary Film Award in 2004.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2010, Schechter was also the executive editor and \"blogger-in-chief\" at the now-defunct MediaChannel.org, for which he wrote a nearly-3000-word daily blog on media and society. Known for his sharp criticism of corporate media, Schechter was just as scathing in his opinions about PBS, who rejected several of his ideas for documentaries including a biography for \"American Masters\" on economist John Kenneth Galbraith. In a 2002 column for \"Current\" Schechter wrote, \"PBS is a land of niches and bailiwicks, a Japanese-style employment system topped with execs who seem to have cushy jobs for life if they play it safe. They are thus very risk-averse and barely accountable to the public in whose name they are paid.”\n\nSchechter died of pancreatic cancer on March 19, 2015 in New York City.\n\n\nSchechter produced and directed many television specials and documentary films, including:\n\nSchechter's books include:\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"White Stripe in the Waves\", he ranks 30th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Zhang Shun as six \"chi\" tall, fair in complexion and having a beautiful beard. Nicknamed \"White Stripe in the Waves\", he is a consummate swimmer who could stay under water for long periods of time.\n\nZhang Shun and his elder brother Zhang Heng live at Jieyang Ridge (揭陽嶺; believed to be in present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) near the Xunyang River. They use a trick to rob travellers who take their boat without taking lives. Zhang Shun would disguise himself as a passenger whom Zhang Heng would throw overboard when he pretends to be unwilling to hand over his valuables. Zhang Shun would make it to shore while the other travellers are so frightened that they surrender all they have. Zhang Shun later moves to Jiangzhou alone (江州; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) where he becomes a fishmonger. \n\nSoon after he reached the prison camp of Jiangzhou, Song Jiang, in exile from Yuncheng as a mitigated sentence for killing his mistress, becomes friend of the chief warden Dai Zong and jailer Li Kui. They go to dine at a riverside restaurant. Song Jiang suddenly craves for fish, but those available in the restaurant are not fresh. Li Kui immediately goes to the riverside market to get him some. The fishermen refuse to sell him any before the chief fishmonger comes. Too impatient to wait, Li Kui tries to grab fishes from the underwater cages and inadvertently releases them into the river. Zhang Shun, the fishmonger, arrives and fights Li. But he is no match for the burly guy. Fortunately Song Jiang and Dai Zong come by and stop Li Kui from hammering him further. Although Zhang slips away, he challenges Li Kui from a boat. Li jumps onto the boat, which is immediately overturned by Zhang. In the water, Li Kui is completely at the mercy of the fishmonger, who keeps him submerged. As one is fair-skinned and the other dark, their stark contrast in complexion amuses the onlookers each time they bob above the water.\n\nEarlier, when on his way to Jiangzhou, Song Jiang met Zhang Heng at the Jieyang River, who asked him to deliver a letter to his brother. Upon knowing the guy is Zhang Shun, Song calls out his name and mentions the letter. Hearing that, Zhang Shun stops toying with Li Kui and pulls him back to land. He makes peace with Li and the four laugh over the fight.\n\nSong Jiang is arrested and sentenced to death for composing a seditious poem, which he wrote on the wall of a restaurant after getting drunk. The outlaws from Liangshan Marsh hurry to Jiangzhou, storm the execution ground and rescue him and Dai Zong, who is implicated following his attempt to rescue Song. After fleeing Jiangzhou, the group is stranded at a riverbank. Luckily, Zhang Shun, Zhang Heng and other friends of Song Jiang from the Jieyang region arrive in boats on their way to rescue him. Determined to get back at Huang Wenbing, the minor official who reported the seditious poem to the authorities, Song plans an attack on the Wuwei Garrison where Huang lives. Huang is not at home but he runs into Zhang Shun while crossing a river as he hurries back upon seeing his town is on fire. Zhang overturns the boat and captures him in water. Song Jiang kills Huang and joins Liangshan, taking with him the Zhang brothers and others.\nWhen Song Jiang is attacking Daming Prefecture (大名府; present-day Daming County, Hebei) with a force to rescue Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu, he suddenly falls very ill with a tumour on his back. A fever comes on and never subsides, causing him to fall into delirium. Back in Liangshan with the force withdrawn, Song continues to be bedridden, with his condition deteriorating and all medicines to no avail. Zhang Shun, who grew up in the Yangtze region, remembers that his mother once suffered from a similar illness and was healed by a physician An Daoquan. He volunteers to find An in Jiankang Prefecture (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) and bring him to Liangshan.\n\nZhang Shun comes to the Yangtze and boards the boat of the pirate Zhang Wang. Midway across the river, Zhang Wang pounces on him when he is asleep, ties him up and throws him into the river. An excellent swimmer, Zhang Shun frees himself under water and gets to the opposite bank, where he finds the inn of Wang Dingliu. Wang's father provides him dry clothes and lodgings and introduces his son saying the young man wishes to join Liangshan. Zhang Shun however has to go to Jiankang first to get An Daoquan.\n\nZhang Shun finds An Daoquan but the physician is unwilling to leave a prostitute called Li Qiaonu whom he is besotted with. Just when Zhang is wondering how to get An to Liangshan, he discovers Li is also patronised by Zhang Wang, who visits the woman one night when An is drunk at her place. Zhang Shun budges in and kills Li when the two are making out but Zhang Wang gets away. Remembering what Wu Song did in Mengzhou, Zhang Shun writes with the blood of Li on the wall a proclamation attributed to An declaring himself to be the killer. When An recovers from his stupour, he has no choice but to go with Zhang Shun to Liangshan.\n\nAt Wang Dingliu's inn, Zhang Shun plots with the young man to get back his own on Zhang Wang. Wang Dingliu finds Zhang Wang and hires him as their ferryman. When the boat is midstream, Zhang Shun, who has been hiding his face, overcomes the boatman with the help of Wang Dingliu, ties him up and dumps him into the river. Wang follows Zhang Shun and An Daoquan to Liangshan, where the physician cures Song Jiang of his life-threatening illness.\n\nZhang Shun is appointed as one of the commanders of Liangshan‘s flotilla after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly.\n\nZhang Shun's swimming skill is pivotal in Liangshan's battle against the army led by Grand Marshal Gao Qiu to wipe out the stronghold. He reaches Gao's ships by swimming underwater unnoticed with his men and knock holes in their hulls, causing them to sink. As a result, Gao is captured.\n\nAfter the Liangshan outlaws received amnesty from Emperor Huizong, Zhang Shun participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory ordered by the court.\n\nIn the battle of Hangzhou in the campaign against Fang La, Zhang Shun attempts to sneak into the city by climbing over the sluice gate of Yongjin (). However, Fang Tianding, Fang La's son, spots him and orders his archers to rain arrows on him. Though killed, Zhang Shun possesses Zhang Heng's body, seeks out Fang Tianding and kills him with the hand of his brother. His spirit leaves Zhang Heng's body after the revenge.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332072", "title": "Zipper (ride)", "text": "Zipper (ride)\n\nThe Zipper is an amusement ride invented by Joseph Brown under Chance Rides in 1968. Popular at carnivals and amusement parks in the United States, Canada, Australia, Mexico and New Zealand, it features strong vertical G-forces, numerous spins, and a noted sense of unpredictability. Chance Rides has manufactured more than 200 units since the ride's debut.\n\nMost models of the Zipper follow a similar basic format: A long, rotating, oval boom with a cable around its edge that pulls 12 cars around the ride. Except at peak times, most operators will only fill half of the cars at one time with riders. Like most carnival equipment, the ride is designed to be portable; it can be disassembled onto a truck and transported from site to site.\n\nThough a staple of amusement parks and carnivals, the original models of the Zipper garnered a reputation for being unsafe due to their rough nature, and a series of deaths on the rides in the late 1970s after cabin doors came unlatched led to a series of revisions, primarily restructuring of the door lock system. Nevertheless, the ride has amassed a cult following over its decades in operation, and was named by \"Popular Mechanics\" as one of the strangest amusement park rides in the world.\n\nThe Zipper was created by Joseph Brown under Chance Rides in 1968 in Wichita, Kansas, and registered under patent 3,596,905 in 1971. The ride's basic design was based on an earlier ride called The Swooper, invented in 1928, which also featured a series of cars being pulled along a cable around an oblong framework. The central difference between The Swooper and the Zipper was the ability of the Zipper's frame to rotate as the cars travel along it by cable.\n\nThe Zipper has a long oblong frame (the boom) that rotates like a Ferris wheel, with free-flipping cars suspended on off-center axes that move around the sides of the boom via a pulley system. Each passenger capsule is essentially a bench seat that snugly fits two people, built into a compartment of metal mesh contoured to protect the riders' entire bodies. The odd, apostrophe-shaped capsules, spaced evenly along the perimeter of the boom, look very much like the rows of interlocking teeth on a zipper, the characteristic for which the ride was named.\n\nThe passenger capsules travel around the perimeter of the boom at 4 revolutions per minute (rpm), not particularly fast, but the \"flip\" around the end of the oblong frame causes a sudden burst of speed and sends the compartments flipping end over end. The boom itself rotates at 7.5 rpm in the same direction as the pulley system. This combined but offset rotation provides each capsule with a unique and unpredictable experience. Zippers rotate both clockwise and counter-clockwise, and most are run with several rotations in each direction constituting \"one ride\".\n\nIf the riders shift enough body weight in one direction, they may be able to flip the car even when the boom and the attached cable are motionless. Each car allows limited space for riders. The restraint system for the riders are a lap bar and bars to hang on to. Not holding on to this bar when the ride suddenly jerks can cause a rider's head to hit the door in front of them. Riders also have the ability to attempt to shift their weight to try to flip their car as many times as possible during the ride, even with the little extra space available in the car.\n\nThe first fourteen Zippers manufactured spun at much higher speeds than modern models. The boom rotated at 11 rpm and the cable system at 7 rpm. These first-generation rides kept the passenger compartments spinning on their axes constantly, creating unsafe g-forces and causing impact-related injuries such as whiplash, bruises and back injuries. The safety hazard was quickly discovered and the mechanical rpms were permanently lowered to current speeds.\n\nOn September 7, 1977, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a public warning, urging carnival-goers not to ride the Zipper after four deaths occurred due to compartment doors opening mid-ride. The safety restraints being attached to the door itself, riders are left unrestrained whenever the door is open. The four victims all died after falling from their compartments. The failure was traced to original spring-close latches on the doors wearing out and not being replaced. Compartments on currently operating Zippers are secured using the original latch, a redundant latch approved by the CPSC, and a large R-Key pin as a second backup.\n\nDespite these new safety features, the same scenario was repeated in July 2006 in Hinckley, Minnesota when two teenage girls were ejected from their compartment as the door swung open. Their door was apparently not properly closed by the operator who admitted to local law enforcement that he had not inserted the safety pin (R-Key) before starting the ride. Both of the victims, Erica Matrious and Breanna Larsen, survived the incident despite facing some serious injuries. On November 2, 2006, the girls were interviewed.\n\nMany newer models of Zipper have solved this problem by completely restructuring the door lock system, also eliminating the need for an R-key. These newer models have also increased the weight of the compartments, reducing the spinning, which decreases pressure on the door latches.\n\nZipper operators are encouraged to employ a \"no single rider\" policy. The manufacturer's concern was that a person riding alone might turn sideways in the seat and remove their legs from underneath the lap bar, risking serious injury as the capsule spun. The manufacturer sent out a bulletin to Zipper owners in 1995 pointing out the risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·In 2012, a documentary titled \"ZIPPER: Coney Island's Last Wild Ride\" was made, dealing with the ride's eventual removal at Coney Island and the economical reasons behind it.\n\nLegendary recording artist Michael Jackson operated a Zipper at his Neverland Ranch. After Jackson's death in 2009, the ride—among several others— was auctioned with his estate, and began traveling with carnivals across the country, advertised as a piece of history.\n\nIn \"\", Greg Heffley rides a version of the Zipper called \"Cranium Shaker”. The ride also appears in the movie version, but the ride is different from its book counterpart, as it is a Skyscraper instead.\n\nThe ride appears in the video game \"Planet Coaster\" as the thrill ride \"Kick Flip\". It is billed as \"A modern take on a fairground classic.\"\n\nThe ride appears in the 2019 film, \"Toy Story 4\" as seen in the carnival.\n\n"}

{"id": "2332078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332078", "title": "Cigar box guitar", "text": "Cigar box guitar\n\nThe cigar box guitar is a simple chordophone that uses an empty cigar box as a resonator. The earliest had one or two strings; modern models typically have three or more. Generally, the strings are connected to the end of a broomstick or a 1 x 3 inch wood slate and to the cigar box resonator.\n\nCigars were packed in boxes, crates, and barrels as early as 1800, but the small boxes that we are familiar with today did not exist prior to around 1840. Until then, cigars were shipped in larger crates containing 100 or more per case. After 1840, cigar manufacturers started using smaller, more portable boxes with 20–50 cigars per box.\n\nTrace evidence of cigar box instruments exists from 1840 to the 1860s. The earliest known illustration of a cigar box instrument is an etching copyrighted in 1876 of two American Civil War soldiers at a campsite, one of whom is playing a cigar box fiddle. The etching was created by illustrator and artist Edwin Forbes, who, under the banner of \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\", worked for the Union Army. The etching was included in Forbes's work \"Life Stories of the Great Army\". In the etching, the fiddle clearly shows the brand \"Figaro\" on the cigar box.\n\nIn addition to the etching, plans for a cigar box banjo were published by Daniel Carter Beard, co-founder of the Boy Scouts of America, in 1884 as part of \"Christmas Eve with Uncle Enos\". The plans, retitled \"How to Build an Uncle Enos Banjo\", were included in the 1890 edition of Beard's \"American Boy's Handy Book\" as supplementary material at the back of the book. These plans omitted the story but still showed a step-by-step description of a playable five-string fretless banjo made from a cigar box.\n\nIt would seem that the earliest cigar box instruments would be crude and primitive, but this is not always the case. According to William Jehle, curator of The Cigar Box Guitar Museum and the author of \"\", the museum acquired two cigar box fiddles built in 1886 and 1889 that seem very playable and well built. The 1886 fiddle was made for an 8-year-old boy and is certainly playable, but the 1889 fiddle has a well-carved neck and slotted violin headstock. The latter instrument was made for serious playing.\n\nCigar box guitars and fiddles were also important in the rise of jug bands and blues. As most of these performers were black Americans living in poverty, many could not afford a \"real\" instrument. Using these, along with the washtub bass (similar to the cigar box guitar), jug, washboard, and harmonica, black musicians performed blues during socializations.\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s saw a resurgence of homemade musical instruments. Times were hard in the American South, and sitting on the front porch singing away the blues was a popular pastime. Musical instruments were beyond the means of most people, but with an old cigar box, a piece of broom handle and a couple of wires from the screen door, a guitar was born.\n\nA modern revival of these instruments (also known as the Cigar Box Guitar Revolution) has been gathering momentum with an increase in the number of cigar box guitar builders and performers. A loose-knit group of underground musicians tour the East Coast of the United States each summer under the banner \"Masters of the Cigar Box Guitar Tour.\" These musicians include Doctor Oakroot, Johnny Lowebow, Tomi-O and many others. A growing number of primitive luthiers are adding cigar box guitars to their items for sale. The Top cigar box guitar builders of today are Shane Speal, Mike Snowden, Del Puckett and Peter Lake of Heavy Fog Guitars.\n\nThe modern revival is sometimes due to interest in jug bands and the DIY culture, as a cigar box is inexpensive in comparison with other factors, such as strings and construction time. Many modern cigar box guitar makers can be seen as practitioners of a type of lutherie and implement various personal touches, such as the addition of pickups and resonator cones.\nThe modern revival of cigar box guitars is documented in the 2008 film \"Songs Inside the Box\", which was shot primarily at the Cigar Box Guitar Extravaganza, an annual event held in Huntsville, Alabama.\nThe Cigar Box Guitar Museum, a free display dedicated to cigar box guitars, is located in Speal's Tavern, a small blues club in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania. It is curated by cigar box guitarist Shane Speal and contains over 60 antique and modern cigar box guitars.\n\nMany different tunings can be used for cigar box guitars.

This is a challenging process as it requires meticulous attention to time and temperature to avoid over- or under-cooking the meat.\n\nIn a \"pakki\" biryani, the meat is marinated for a shorter time and cooked before being layered with the rice and cooked in a dough-sealed vessel. In \"pakki aqni\" (with cooked gravy), the ingredients are cooked before baking.\n\nThe gravy is redolent of mace, ittar and kewra. Saffron and cardamom are also used.\n\nThere is also a vegetarian version of the biryani which is made using vegetables such as carrots, peas, cauliflower, potatoes, and cashews.\n\nA biryani is usually served with dahi chutney and mirchi ka salan. Baghaar-e-baingan is a common side dish. The salad includes onion, carrot, cucumber, and lemon wedges.\n\n\n\n"}

Kroft (born August 22, 1945) is an American journalist (now retired), best known as a long-time correspondent for \"60 Minutes\". His investigative reporting has garnered him acclaim that includes three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, one of which was an Emmy for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nKroft was born on August 22, 1945, in Kokomo, Indiana, the son of Margaret and Fred Kroft. Kroft attended Syracuse University, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1967. At Syracuse, he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. After his graduation, he was drafted into the United States Army and served in the Vietnam War. He was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division in Cu Chi, where he was a reporter for the Armed Forces Network; he covered the Division's participation in the invasion of Cambodia. Kroft won several Army journalism awards for his work and a Bronze Star for \"Meritorious Achievement\". When the Division was redeployed, he was reassigned to the military newspaper \"Stars and Stripes\" as a correspondent and photographer.\n\nShortly after receiving an honorable discharge from the army in 1971, he began his broadcast journalism career as a reporter for WSYR-TV in Syracuse, New York. Kroft returned to academics in 1974, enrolling at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and earning his master's degree in 1975. Upon graduation Kroft moved to Florida, where he worked for two stations owned by the Washington Post Company. As an investigative reporter for WJXT in Jacksonville, his reports on local corruption led to several grand jury investigations and established his reputation. In 1977 he moved to WPLG-TV in Miami, where his work came to the attention of CBS News.\n\nKroft joined CBS News in 1980 as a reporter in its Northeast bureau, based out of New York City. The next year, he was named a correspondent and the network soon moved him to its \nSouthwest Bureau in Dallas, where he stayed until 1983. That year, Kroft returned to Florida after CBS reassigned him to its Miami bureau. He was soon making frequent visits to the Caribbean and Latin America, covering the civil war in El Salvador and the U.S. invasion of Grenada.\n\nIn 1984, Kroft landed a job as a foreign correspondent at the CBS London bureau, where he traveled extensively to cover stories in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Many of his assignments involved international terrorism and sectarian violence, including the hijackings of TWA Flight 847 and Achille Lauro, the Rome and Vienna airport attacks of the Abu Nidal Organization, the Lebanese Civil War, and the violence in Northern Ireland. His report for the \"CBS Evening News\" on the assassination of Indira Gandhi won him an Emmy. In 1986, CBS News brought Kroft back to the United States to become a principal correspondent on a new magazine show called \"West 57th\". He stayed in that position until the program was cancelled in the spring of 1989.\n\nThat September, Kroft and Meredith Vieira, a \"West 57th\" colleague, joined \"60 Minutes\". In 1990, he became the first American journalist to be given extensive access to the contaminated grounds of the Chernobyl nuclear facility, and his story won an Emmy. After allegations of infidelity surfaced in the 1992 presidential election, then-Governor Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, gave an exclusive interview to Kroft. The interview was one of the defining moments in the election.\n\nKroft continued to file groundbreaking reports for \"60 Minutes\". A 1992 segment which detailed a friendly fire incident in the Gulf War won him his first Peabody Award. Two of Kroft's stories in 1994, a profile of Senator Bob Dole and an exposé on the Cuban government's quarantine policy for people infected with AIDS, won Emmy awards. In 2003, he and the rest of the \"60 Minutes\" team were awarded Emmys for lifetime achievement.\n\nKroft asked Clint Eastwood how many children he has while interviewing the highly secretive actor in 1997. When Eastwood responded \"I have a few,\" Kroft broached the subject with a declarative question: \"Seven kids with five women, right?\"—actually a conservative estimate, but at the time an unprecedented statement. Eastwood did not answer and stared at Kroft in silence for 30 seconds.\n\nIn May 2019, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" disclosed Kroft will retire from \"60 Minutes\" on May 19, 2019, his 30th season on the show.\n\nKroft has been corrected by Gallup.com on public opinion he cited while interviewing U.S. President Barack Obama on December 13, 2009. He stated in the interview that \"Most Americans right now don't believe this war's worth fighting\". He then questioned President Obama, about why he was conducting the war without public support. Gallup Editor in Chief Frank Newport challenged his statement and presented data, that indicated that Americans were split on the War in Afghanistan.\n\nIn March 2009, Kroft asked Obama, who was laughing while discussing the recession, \"Are you punch drunk?\"\n\nRegarding the interview of Obama and Hillary Clinton on January 27, 2013, Conor Friedersdorf of \"The Atlantic\" argues that Steve Kroft's softball interview technique diminishes \"60 Minutes\". Peggy Noonan, in a column titled \"So God Made a Fawner\" in \"The Wall Street Journal\", says that Kroft's interview was as \"soft as a sneaker full of puppy excrement.\"\n\nKroft lives in New York City with his wife, Jennet Conant, who is a journalist and author. They have one son, John Conant Kroft, who, as of 2012, attends the Juilliard School. According to several reports, Kroft has admitted to an affair with Lisan Goines, a married Manhattan lawyer, who is a graduate of Columbia Law School.\n\nHe appeared as himself on an episode of \"Murphy Brown\". He played himself again in Woody Allen's 2000 movie \"Small Time Crooks\", in which he interviewed Allen's character for a segment on \"60 Minutes\".\n\n\n\n"}

The area is also known as Pecinan or Chinatown since the Dutch colonial era, and is considered the biggest in Indonesia. Majority of the traders and residents of Glodok are Chinese descent. The area dates back to colonial times when in November 1740, Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) designated Glodok as a residential area for ethnic Chinese. Administratively, the area is a \"kelurahan\" under the Taman Sari subdistrict, West Jakarta.\n\nOne of the biggest trading center for electronic goods in Jakarta is located within the area now.\n\nThe word Glodok came from the Sundanese word \"Golodog\", meaning entrance to a house, as Sunda Kalapa (Jakarta) is the gateway to the ancient Sundanese Kingdom. It was also thought that the name came from the \"grojok grojok\" sound that water makes coming out of a waterspout in the yard of the Cityhall (Stadhuis), now the Jakarta Museum. A waterspout was built on this site in 1743 and was used for daily needs such as a watering hole for horses.\n\nIn Batavia (now Jakarta), Dutch East India Company created commercial opportunities which attracted immigrants from many areas of what is now Indonesia. This economic activity also lured thousands of Chinese people to Java. Swift immigration challenged the city's limited infrastructure and created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations.\n\nOn 9 October 1740, 5,000 Chinese were massacred and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were ghettoized in Glodok outside the city walls. In 1998, Glodok was badly scarred during rioting. Because some \"Pribumi\" Indonesians accused Chinese Indonesians of hoarding the nation's wealth, and because of the large concentration of Chinese Indonesians residing there, Glodok also suffered severe violence during the Jakarta Riots of May 1998.\nIn 2006, practitioners of Falun Gong were reportedly \"assaulted\" during a meditation session. A Falun Gong representative suggested that the assailants were sent by the Chinese embassy, though a local news organization noted another possible motivation: that Falun Gong practitioners had been \"disrupting business\" by distributing pamphlets.\n\nAs for shopping centre, most of the vendors in Glodok are Chinese Indonesian. Glodok is the biggest Chinatown area in Indonesia, and one of the biggest Chinatowns in the world. China town covers three main areas, namely Gang Gloria (Gloria alley), Jalan Pancoran and Petak Sembilan. The Chinese came to Jakarta since the 17th century as traders and labourers. Most of them came from Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China. Centred on Pintu Besar Selatan Road, it has become a commercial hub for the relatively prosperous Chinese community. Assimilation between Chinese and \"pribumi\" made a language known as Betawi language.Chinese New Year celebrations and Cap Go Meh celebrations held in the area is attraction. The area is now a spot to buy Chinese food, traditional Chinese medicine and cheap electronic goods.\n\nGlodok and contiguous of Mangga Dua are one of the biggest shopping centres in Southeast Asia. It stretches from Pancoran street to Gunung Sahari street and has approximately 500,000 m2 of shopping centres. Beside sale of electronic consumer goods, Glodok is the biggest market for CD and DVD cassettes. Some of the shopping centers in this area are,\nOther than shopping, Glodok is a spot to buy Chinese food, traditional Chinese medicine and cheap electronic goods. Gang Gloria is a famous place for a wide array of dishes, including gado-gado (mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce), soto betawi (beef cooked in coconut milk), ketupat sayur (rice cakes served with coconut milk and vegetables), sek ba (pork offal stewed in soy sauce) and more. Established in 1927, the legendary Kopi Es Tak Kie coffee shop specializes in iced coffee. Rujak Shanghai Encim (boiled cuttlefish, radish, cucumber, and water spinach with red sauce and peanut sprinkle) this fresh salad was established around 1950s. This kind of dish is very rare, and only able find it at Glodok. \n\nThere are three temples in the area, namely Dharma Bhakti Temple, Dharma Sakti Temple and Hui Tek Bio temple. Dharma Bhakti temple, which was established in 1650 is the oldest temple in Jakarta.\nSanta de Fatima Catholic Church, which is built in Chinese architecture located at Jl. Kemurnian III.\n\nThere are many bus services provided by TransJakarta, PPD, Mayasari Bakti, and city transport.

{"id": "2332124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332124", "title": "Dai Zong", "text": "Dai Zong\n\nDai Zong is a fictional character in \"Water Margin\", one of the Four Great Classical Novels in Chinese literature. Nicknamed \"Magic Traveller\", he ranks 20th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Dai Zong as having a broad face, a squarish mouth and a lean body. He can cover 800 \"li\" in a day on foot by incanting a magical spell to activate power in two talismans tied to his legs. Because he is an incredibly fast runner, he is nicknamed \"Magic Traveller\".\n\nA chief warden of a prison in Jiangzhou (江州; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), Dai Zong is a good friend of Wu Yong, the chief strategist of the outlaw band at Liangshan Marsh.\n\nWhen Song Jiang is exiled to Jiangzhou as a mitigated sentence for killing his mistress Yan Poxi, he passes by Liangshan and meets Wu Yong, who writes a letter for him to take to Dai Zong. The letter requests Dai to treat Song well. In Jiangzhou, Dai initially wants Song Jiang to bribe him in exchange for lenient treatment. After reading Wu Yong's letter, Dai Zong apologises and makes all efforts to ensure Song has a comfortable life in prison. In fact Song can go in and out of the prison camp at will. He also comes to know and develop a strong bond with Dai Zong's subordinate, the jailer Li Kui.\n\nOne day Song Jiang, feeling miserable over his misfortunes, writes a poem on the wall of a restaurant after getting drunk. The seditious poem is discovered by a petty official Huang Wenbing, who reports it to Cai Jiu, the prefect of Jiangzhou. Cai orders Dai Zong to take Song to him. Dai tells Song to pretend to be insane to suggest the poem is the scribble of a mad man. However, Huang Wenbing sees through the pretence and suggests giving Song a sound beating to make him \"sober\". Song eventually admits that his mind is sound.\n\nViewing the case as a grave matter, Cai Jiu writes a letter to his father, the Grand Tutor Cai Jing, in the imperial capital Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan), to seek advice. Dai Zong is assigned to deliver the letter. When resting at an inn of Liangshan run by Zhu Gui, Dai is drugged. Luckily the letter on him reveals his identity. He is brought to Chao Gai, the chief of Liangshan, and Wu Yong. Wu suggests faking a letter by Cai Jing to order Cai Jiu to send Song Jiang to Dongjing for punishment. The plan is to rescue Song midway. But he needs the help of the scholar Xiao Rang, who could imitate Cai Jing‘s distinctive and universally recognised handwriting, and the engraver Jin Dajian, who could fabricate Cai‘s personal seal. Dai Zong hurries to call on the two men and lies to them that their skills are needed in the renovation of a temple. Xiao and Jin are brought near to Liangshan, where they are kidnapped. The two have no choice but to join the stronghold and participate in Wu Yong's plan.\n\nCai Jiu nearly falls for the ruse. However, Huang Wenbing points out that the seal on the letter is not an appropriate one between father and son -- a sign that the letter is fake. Furious that Dai Zong has betrayed him, Cai Jiu orders his arrest. At Huang‘s urging, Cai Jiu sentences both Dai and Song to death. Meanwhile, Wu Yong has realised the mistake in the letter. He sends several chieftains to rescue the two in Jiangzhou. Just when the executioners are about to swing their knives in the public execution, Li Kui jumps out and kills them. The Liangshan chieftains surrounding the place also rush forth to fight off the soldiers. Dai Zong follows the outlaws back to Liangshan.\n\nDai Zong serves Liangshan well with his running speed, which is especially important in an emergency situation. For example, when Song Jiang is thwarted by the sorcery of Gao Lian in his military attack on Gaotangzhou (高唐州; around present-day Gaotang County, Shandong) to rescue Chai Jin, Dai Zong is despatched to Jizhou (薊州; present-day Ji County, Tianjin) with Li Kui to locate the Taoist magician Gongsun Sheng, who could rival Gao. Gongsun has left Liangshan to visit his mother and has failed to return. Li Kui is enabled to travel in the same pace as Dai, but he could not make a brake when propelled by Dai into dizzying speeds after he infringed the latter's order to keep to vegetarian food. They eventually find Gongsun and the three speed to Gaotangzhou. In another instance, Dai brings the physician An Daoquan speedily back to Liangshan to cure Song Jiang of a deadly tumour. Dai's speed is also crucial in the collection and conveyance of intelligence when Liangshan faces a hostile force. His speed could help make friendship too, such as when Yang Lin notices his unusual pace and calls out his name. \n\nDai Zong is appointed as the chief of Liangshan's scouting team after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.\n\nDai Zong is one of the few Liangshan heroes who survive the run of campaigns. He is awarded an official post in Yanzhou (兗州; around present-day Jining, Shandong). But he soon resigns and lives as a recluse in a Taoist temple, where he dies shortly.\n\n"}

His companies employ more than 2,000 people throughout North America and Europe.\n\nRarely seen without his trademark Panama hat, Roush is known on the NASCAR circuit as \"The Cat in the Hat\".\n\nRoush was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame on April 27, 2006. In 2008, Roush was elected to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and was inducted on September 13, 2010, in Novi.\nOn May 23, 2018, Jack Roush was selected as one of the five inductees for the 2019 NASCAR Hall of Fame class.\n\nRoush was born in Covington, Kentucky and grew up in Manchester, Ohio. He earned a Mathematics degree with a minor in physics from Berea College, and a masters in Scientific Mathematics from Eastern Michigan University.\n\nRoush worked at Ford after graduating in 1966, and left in 1970 to pursue his own company. He worked for a year at Chrysler before leaving to open his own engineering business. Roush then went on to partner with Wayne Gapp to race in NHRA, IHRA, and AHRA drag racing events.\n\nThroughout much of his career Roush offered for sale the parts that he developed for his own team. In 1982, he partnered with German firm Zakspeed to develop road racing vehicles for Ford. This led to a very successful run in the Trans-Am series and IMSA Camel GT in the 1980s and early 90s. In 1988, Roush moved south and founded a NASCAR Winston Cup Series team with driver Mark Martin.\n\nRoush Fenway Racing currently fields two cars in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (driven by Chris Buescher, and Ryan Newman), and two cars in the NASCAR Xfinity Series (the #16 driven by Ryan Reed and the #60 shared between Austin Cindric and Ty Majeski). The Xfinity team was shut down after the 2018 NASCAR season. Roush has won eight championships as a car owner in NASCAR's top three series: two Cup titles (2003 with Matt Kenseth and 2004 with Kurt Busch), five Xfinity Series titles (2002 with Greg Biffle, 2007 with Carl Edwards, 2011–2012 with Stenhouse Jr., and 2015 with Chris Buescher and a Camping World Truck Series title in 2000 with Biffle. Roush has two Daytona 500 victories as a car owner, both with driver Kenseth in 2009 and 2012. Since Roush entered NASCAR competition his team has 283 wins and 212 poles.\n\nThroughout his NASCAR career Roush has been an outspoken opponent of Toyota's NASCAR operations. Roush is vocally loyal to Ford and throughout his career has made cracks against Toyota being in NASCAR. One time in 2003 when asked for a reaction to Toyota's interests in joining NASCAR as a manufacturer team, Roush compared it to Pearl Harbor and called them \"Ankle-biting chihuahuas.\" In 2007 Roush entered a verbal feud with Toyota team leader Lee White during the Toyota controversy following the rocket fuel incident. Though he and White are close friends and former business partners,\n\nRoush Performance sells a variety of vehicles, parts, and high-performance crate engines. Perhaps best known for the line of upfitted Ford Mustangs, they have more than 16,000 vehicles on the roads today. Typical improvements on the base chassis include appearance packages (body kit, wheels, etc.), suspension and handling upgrades, and horsepower boosts through the use of a ROUSHcharger supercharger system. ROUSH Performance sells versions of their Mustang with as much as 727 horsepower and 610 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe company has a line of more than 1,500 high-performance parts that fit a variety of vehicles including the Mustang, F-150, Focus and others. The crate engines can be customized per owner preference and are the choice of many hot rod and Cobra replicar builders such as Chip Foose, Roy Brizio, and Superformance.\n\nBy 2008, Roush had expanded into offering propane-autogas-fueled vehicles designed for fleet usage. The company product offerings include propane autogas fuel system technology for medium-duty Ford commercial vehicles, and Type A and Type C Blue Bird Corporation school buses. Most vehicle kits offer multiple tank configurations.\n\nPropane autogas is a domestically produced alternative fuel which costs less than conventional fuels. Over the past 30 years, propane autogas has cost, on average, 30 percent less than gasoline and 40 percent less than diesel. More than 90 percent is produced in the U.S. (and an additional 7 percent from Canada), which lessens American dependency on foreign oil. The fuel burns substantially cleaner than gasoline or diesel.\n\nROUSH CleanTech's propane autogas-fueled vehicles have the same horsepower, torque and towing capacity as their gasoline-powered equivalents. The shift to a dedicated liquid propane fuel system does not affect vehicle functionality. Ford's factory warranty remains intact on the ROUSH CleanTech vehicles. Propane emits fewer greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides than gasoline, diesel, heavy fuel oil or E85 ethanol per unit of energy.\n\nIn 2011, ROUSH CleanTech began production on propane autogas-fueled vehicles for Frito-Lay. In 2012, the company started to manufacture propane fuel systems for Blue Bird Type C and Micro Bird Type A school buses. In 2017, ROUSH CleanTech developed the first propane autogas engine available in class 4 – 7 vehicles certified to the California Air Resources Board’s optional low nitrogen oxide level of .05 g/bhp-hr.\n\nAcross the nation, companies such as Bimbo Bakeries, DISH, SuperShuttle and ThyssenKrupp Elevator; hundreds of school districts, including Broward County and Los Angeles Unified School District; and transit agencies such as SMART in Michigan, West Palm Beach Transit and Flint Mass Transit, have experienced reduced fuel and operating costs while lowering their carbon footprint with propane autogas vehicles.\n\nAs of 2017, ROUSH CleanTech has deployed almost 15,000 Ford trucks and vans and Blue Bird school buses fueled by propane autogas to fleets throughout the United States. More than 90 percent of all propane school buses currently operating in the U.S. are equipped with a ROUSH CleanTech fuel system. School districts choose propane over diesel to accommodate tighter budgets and help improve air quality.\n\nROUSH CleanTech developed the industry's first propane autogas engine with nitrogen oxide emissions of 0.05 grams per brake horsepower-hour—below the current U.S. EPA limit of 0.2 g/bhp-hr.\n\nROUSH CleanTech's president Joe Thompson blogs about alternative fuels at Fleet Owner's IdeaXchange and Green Fleet's Fuel for Thought.\n\nOn April 19, 2002 (his 60th birthday), Roush almost lost his life when his private plane, an Aircam, went down in a lake in Troy, Alabama. Roush was underwater and unconscious, suffering from a concussion, when Larry Hicks, a retired Marine in a nearby boat, rescued Roush from under water, pulled him to safety, and administered CPR. Shortly afterwards, Roush was flown to UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, where he was treated for a head injury, broken ribs, and a shattered left leg. Hicks was injured as a result of the rescue, suffering cramps in both his arms and first degree chemical burns on his body from the fuel.\n\nOn July 27, 2010, Roush crashed his Hawker Beechcraft Premier 390 jet (registration N6JR) during an approach to the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) AirVenture Fly-In in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in the late afternoon. He walked out of the plane and was taken to a nearby hospital. His condition was listed at serious but stable that evening. On August 3, Roush was upgraded to fair condition. On August 13, Roush made his first at track appearance since the incident at the Michigan International Speedway. During that time he confirmed that he fractured his back, broke his jaw, and lost vision in his left eye as a result. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the cause of the crash to pilot error, specifically, \"pilot's decision not to advance the engines to takeoff power during the go-around, as stipulated by the airplane flight manual, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude.\"\n"}

{"id": "2332130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332130", "title": "Nemesis (Resident Evil)", "text": "Nemesis (Resident Evil)\n\nThe Nemesis, also called the Nemesis-T Type, the Pursuer or the , is a fictional character in Capcom's \"Resident Evil\" franchise. Although smaller than other Tyrant models, the creature dwarfs a typical human, and possesses vastly superior intelligence and physical dexterity to its undead peers. It features in \"\" as a titular main villain before later emerging in other titles and cameo roles. It is also featured on various merchandise and in the 2004 film \"\". The character is voiced by Tony Rosato in the original game and Gregg Berger in \"\", and portrayed by Matthew G. Taylor in the film. In the Resident Evil 3 2020 remake, the character is voiced by David Cockman, while Neil Newbon provided the motion capture performance.\n\nSince the Nemesis' introduction, the character has received a positive reception, and has come to be regarded as one of the series' most popular characters. Some publications have praised its role as an intimidating villain, while others have noted it as one of their favourite and most terrifying monsters in video games.\n\nIntroduced in \"Resident Evil 3\", the Nemesis-T Type was designed under the concept of a \"huge, overpowering monster that could use weapons and intelligently track you anywhere.\" During development, many different designs were considered. Although some elements remained constant among them, the early designs featured several different degrees of surface damage, as well as different options for clothing such as a protective vest instead of a coat or a nude design similar to the original Tyrant from \"Resident Evil\".\n\nIn the series' story, the Nemesis-T Type is the result of infecting a T-103 model Tyrant — a humanoid bio-weapon created to be the ultimate lifeform—with the Nemesis Alpha parasite (or \"NE-α\") designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black trousers, an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a rocket launcher mounted on its left arm. To emphasize its design as a prototype, the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye. Upon spotting its target, it says the target's name out loud and attacks.\n\nThe secretions from the parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which result in the creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it \"will\" repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin and the emergence of additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In \"Resident Evil 3\", the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked to try to make it appear as unique as possible.\n\nThe Nemesis, named after the Goddess of Vengeance from Greek mythology, first appears in the 1999 PlayStation game \"\" as the game's title character and primary antagonist. The product of years of research, the prototype is deployed by the Umbrella Corporation as a field test to hunt and kill the STARS police team before they can expose Umbrella's activity in the Arklay mountains. The game’s protagonist, Jill Valentine, first encounters the Nemesis outside Raccoon City’s police station where it kills Brad Vickers and then pursues her, uttering \"\"STARS...\"\" on sight. The Nemesis continues to stalk Valentine throughout the game, attacking with physical blows and grabs, and later, armed with a rocket launcher. After losing its overcoat as a result of heavy damage, the Nemesis mutates, and gains the ability to attack with long, extendable tentacles. Despite later being doused in acid, the Nemesis continues its pursuit, and mutates into a much larger, tentacled monster after absorbing a dead Tyrant, gaining the ability to spew poison. Jill finally defeats the Nemesis using a rail cannon, and then depending on the choice of the player, she either kills it once and for all by unloading her weapons into it, or leaves it to die in the nuclear explosion that destroys Raccoon City.\n\nThe Nemesis also appears in \"\", chasing the player if they fail to complete a level before the time limit expires and killing them instantly if it hits them; it can also be fought as a secret boss armed with a rocket launcher if the player has met the proper conditions upon completing the game. The Nemesis returns for the \"Resident Evil 3\" chapter of \"\", in which it pursues Jill in the same manner as the original game and mutates into its secondary form as a boss. Alongside Jill, the Nemesis also appears in the Capcom title \"Under the Skin\", and serves as a boss the player must steal coins from in a Raccoon City-inspired level. Character cards for the Nemesis additionally appear in \"\" and its Nintendo DS sequel. In an interview, \"\" producer Ryouta Niitsuma stated a desire to use the Nemesis in the title as a \"monster-type\" character from the \"Resident Evil\" series, but was dropped after considering it too \"grotesque and disgusting\" and in consideration of ESRB ratings. The character would instead appear briefly in the game's ending sequence for the Hulk. However, despite the initial concerns about his inclusion, the Nemesis appears as a playable character in \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\", an updated version of \"Marvel vs. Capcom 3\". The Nemesis returns as a playable character in \"\". In the game's story, following the Convergence, it is captured by A.I.M.brella leader M.O.D.O.K. and reprogrammed as his enforcer; it later battles and is defeated by Chris Redfield and Mike Haggar. The Nemesis also appears in \"\". In the game, the Nemesis' programming is damaged and the USS is tasked with finding a NE-Alpha parasite to repair it. Once the parasite is found, the players must defeat the Nemesis and inject it with the parasite. The Nemesis in the game uses a gatling gun for the fight and is mainly based on his film counterpart; however once the mission is completed, the Nemesis awakes to find his rocket launcher and utters his famous line, \"STARS...\" The Nemesis also appears in the tactical role-playing game \"Project X Zone\" as a rival unit. The Nemesis also appears in the 2020 remake of \"Resident Evil 3: Nemesis\", called \"Resident Evil 3\", which in the first boss fight, wields a flamethrower.\n\nThe Nemesis is featured in the 2004 film, \"\", portrayed by Matthew G. Taylor. The character's design was left relatively unchanged, brandishing a rocket launcher and similar attire, but with the addition of a forearm-mounted rail gun, modeled after a heavily modified minigun. Writer and producer Paul W. S. Anderson noted that the gun's addition was inspired by the idea of the Nemesis \"walking around with a gigantic, powerful weapon in each hand and almost indecisive as to which one to use\". The costume for Nemesis was created by Kropserkel Inc. and PJFX Studios, and stands roughly tall, weighing nearly . After production of \"Apocalypse\" was completed, the costume was restored and put on display at Kropserkel's offices.\n\nWhile The Nemesis' design remained similar, the character itself was expanded upon, now portrayed as a tragic villain. Formerly Matt Addison (portrayed by Eric Mabius), a survivor of the events of the first film, he was infected with the T-virus after being scratched by a Licker and later captured and experimented upon by the Umbrella Corporation. Transformed into the Nemesis, he is sent to kill the surviving members of STARS, but remembers his humanity after fighting Alice, and fights alongside the protagonists towards the film's conclusion. The Nemesis is eventually crushed beneath a crashing helicopter, and is later killed by the nuclear explosion that destroys Raccoon City.\n\nThe Nemesis appears in a 1999 Hong Kong manhua adaptation of \"Resident Evil 3\" by Lee Chung Hing, \"Biohazard 3: Last Escape\", which is named after the game's Japanese title. The 27-issue series adds to the Nemesis' backstory, detailing its origin by showing the infection and transformation of the original Tyrant by the Nemesis parasite. Some elements are changed for its design, such as the Nemesis retaining both eyes initially, and then losing the right eye and gaining cranial staples only after an encounter with Jill. The comic also introduces characters from \"Resident Evil 2\" into the storyline, which results in a face-off between the Nemesis and the mutated William Birkin towards the end of the series.\n\nIn 2000, Simon & Schuster published a novelization of \"Resident Evil 3\", written by S. D. Perry. Though left unchanged for the most part, the Nemesis is immediately recognized as a modified Tyrant in the novel, which Jill Valentine dubs the \"Nemesis\" after thinking about why it hunts her. Instead of mutating due to having taken damage, the Nemesis transforms voluntarily towards the conclusion of the story in its pursuit of Jill, with its second form from the game being its actual appearance beneath the coat.\n\nA novelization of \"Apocalypse\" was released in 2004, written by Keith R. A. DeCandido. In the book, Matt and the Nemesis act as separate personalities in the same body, both aware, but with the Nemesis dominant. Matt eventually regains control after his body is impaled on a metal shard while fighting Alice, by showing the Nemesis his memories of Umbrella's experimentation upon \"them\". The Nemesis is later mentioned in the 2007 novelization of \"\", in which antagonist Doctor Isaacs considers the Nemesis both his greatest success and his greatest failure, hating mention of it and blaming its defection and destruction upon Umbrella's desire to immediately field test it.\n\nNemesis appears on the cover of every version of \"Resident Evil 3\", and is mentioned prominently on flyers for \"Resident Evil: Survivor 2\". Capcom has also released commercial products modeled on the character, such as an adult size Halloween mask, and later a silver ring modeled after Nemesis's head available for purchase through their Japanese online store. Palisades Toys used its likeness to create a posable action figure (packaged with a base and equipable rocket launcher) and a mini bust, which were released alongside several other \"Resident Evil\"-based merchandise. Moby Dick released its own line of \"Resident Evil\" action figures bundled in pairs of a playable character and enemy. Included in the series were Nemesis's first and second form, with the first form featuring an alternate head and equipable rocket launcher. Each set additionally includes a part of an action figure of Nemesis's third form, which measures 24 inches (60 cm) long when completed.\n\nFollowing the game's debut in 1999, the Nemesis became one of the most recognizable and popular characters in the \"Resident Evil\" series. G4's \"Filter\" named the Nemesis one of the top ten videogame villains of all time as selected by viewers, placing fifth on the list. IGN noted it as their favorite aspect of \"Resident Evil 3\", stating, \"The point is, he's a bad-ass, and he's got plenty of surprises in store for you besides just fast feet and a big gun\". In another article, IGN noted the Nemesis as one of their favorite video game monsters of all time, but felt disdain for its presentation in the film. They also named him one of the series' best bosses, calling it \"what may be Umbrella's most fearsome creation ever\" and comparing it to \"\"s T-1000, and later one of the top 100 video game villains of all time, placing 59th and described as horrific not for its appearance or attacks but its persistence. 1UP.com named the battle against the Nemesis one of the \"25 of the Most Badass Boss Fights of All Time\", saying \"There are plenty of bosses worth mentioning from the \"Resident Evil\" series... but the one that to this day most people point to as the biggest badass of the bunch is Nemesis\".\n\n\"GamePro\" ranked the Nemesis 29th on their list of the \"47 Most Diabolical Video Game Villains of All Time\", noting the character \"made \"RE3\" memorable even among the other, superior installments in the series\". It ranked fourth on \"Electronic Gaming Monthly's\" \"Top Ten Badass Undead\" article, which described its role as a simple, yet effective villain. GameSpot featured Nemesis in a \"Reader's Choice\" edition of their \"Top 10 Video Game Villains\" article, placing eighth on the list and noting the character's high popularity among fans when compared to the Tyrant. He has also been voted by GamesRadar's readers as the 99th \"most dastardly ne'er-do-wells\" villain in video games in their \"top 100\". GameDaily listed it as one of their favorite Capcom characters of all time, stating \"The \"Resident Evil\" series has a slew of memorable bad guys to choose from... but Nemesis is our favorite.\" The Nemesis additionally ranked fifth on their list of \"Top 25 Scariest Video Game Monsters\". \n\n"}

Barbarossa had been ordered to kidnap her by Ibrahim Pasha, the Ottoman Grand Vizier. Pasha's plan was to add her to the sultan's harem and supplant Roxelana, the sultan's wife. \nShe escaped, and Barbarossa, frustrated, massacred the populations of Fondi and nearby Sperlonga, though he was repulsed at nearby Itri. She fled into the night, accompanied by a single knight. \nShe later had the knight killed because she had been nearly nude during her escape and he had seen too much. \nThere is also speculation that Barbarossa's attempt may have been motivated by members of the Colonna family wishing to recover their lands after Vespasiano Colonna's death.\n\nGiulia Gonzaga joined a convent in Naples in 1535 (at age 22), and there met Juan de Valdés in 1536. \nThis encounter and subsequent correspondence brought her to the attention of the Inquisition, for example leading her to write a letter in 1553 to cardinal Ercole Gonzaga to express her lack of agreement with the later writings of de Valdés.\n\nGiulia Gonzaga died at age 53 in 1566. After her death, her correspondence with Pietro Carnesecchi led to the latter's being burned at the stake for heresy (in 1567).\n\n\n\n"}

Dressed like a Taoist priest and often carrying a hand fan made of crane feathers, Zhu Wu is good in devising military stratagems and deploying soldiers in formation for pitched battle. He is thus nicknamed \"Resourceful Strategist\".\n\nOriginally from Dingyuan (定遠; present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui), Zhu Wu leads a band of outlaws on Mount Shaohua (少華山; southeast of present-day Hua County, Shaanxi), assisted by Chen Da and Yang Chun. Whenever their food stock runs low, the three would go plunder the nearby counties and villages. \n\nOne day Chen Da suggests raiding the quite well-stocked Huayin County for food.

This operation is done for benign conditions that cause urinary retention, as well as for prostate cancer and for other cancers of the pelvis.\n\nThere are two main types of prostatectomies. A simple prostatectomy (also known as a subtotal prostatectomy) involves the removal of only part of the prostate. Surgeons typically carry out simple prostatectomies only for benign conditions. A radical prostatectomy, the removal of the entire prostate gland, the seminal vesicles and the vas deferens, is performed for malignant cancer.\n\nThere are multiple ways the operation can be done: with open surgery (via a large incision through the lower abdomen), laparoscopically with the help of a robot (a type of minimally invasive surgery), through the urethra or through the perineum.\n\nOther terms that can be used to describe a prostatectomy include: \n\nIndications for removal of the prostate in a benign setting include acute urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, uncontrollable hematuria, bladder stones secondary to bladder outlet obstruction, significant symptoms from bladder outlet obstruction that are refractory to medical or minimally invasive therapy, and chronic kidney disease secondary to chronic bladder outlet obstruction.\n\nA radical prostatectomy is performed due to malignant cancer. For prostate cancer, the best treatment often depends on the risk level presented by the disease. For most prostate cancers classified as 'very low risk' and 'low risk,' radical prostatectomy is one of several treatment options; others include radiation, watchful waiting, and active surveillance. For intermediate and high risk prostate cancers, radical prostatectomy is often recommended in addition to other treatment options. Radical prostatectomy is not recommended in the setting of known metastases when the cancer has spread through the prostate, to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Prior to decision making about the best treatment option for higher risk cancers, imaging studies using CT, MRI or bone scans are done to make sure the cancer has not spread outside of the prostate.\n\nThese would be same as the contraindications for any other surgery.\n\nThere are several ways a prostatectomy can be done:\n\nIn an open prostatectomy, the prostate is accessed through a large single incision through either the lower abdomen or the perineum. Further descriptive terms describe how the prostate is accessed anatomically through this incision (retropubic vs. suprapubic vs. perineal). A retropubic prostatectomy describes a procedure that accesses the prostate by going through the lower abdomen and behind the pubic bone. A suprapubic prostatectomy describes a procedure cuts through the lower abdomen and through the bladder to access the prostate. A perineal prostatectomy is done by making an incision between the rectum and scrotum on the underside of the abdomen.\n\nRobotic-assisted instruments are inserted through several small abdominal incisions and controlled by a surgeon. Some use the term 'robotic' for short, in place of the term 'computer-assisted'. However, procedures performed with a computer-assisted device are performed by a surgeon, not a robot. The computer-assisted device gives the surgeon more dexterity and better vision, but no tactile feedback compared to conventional laparoscopy. When performed by a surgeon who is specifically trained and well experienced in CALP, there can be similar advantages over open prostatectomy, including smaller incisions, less pain, less bleeding, less risk of infection, faster healing time, and shorter hospital stay. The cost of this procedure is higher, while long-term functional and oncological superiority have yet to be established.\n\nAny surgical procedure has risks associated with it. Complications that occur in the period right after any surgical procedure, including a prostatectomy, include a risk of bleeding, a risk of infection at the site of incision or throughout the whole body, a risk of a blood clot occurring in the leg or lung, a risk of a heart attack or stroke, and a risk of death.\n\nSevere irritation takes place if a latex catheter is inserted in the urinary tract of a person allergic to latex. That is especially severe in case of a radical prostatectomy due to the open wound there and the exposure lasting e.g. two weeks. Intense pain may indicate such situation.\n\nA 2005 article in the medical journal \"Reviews in Urology\" listed the incidence of several complications following radical prostatectomy: mortality <0.3%, impotence >50%, ejaculatory dysfunction 100%, orgasmic dysfunction 50%, incontinence <5%-30%, pulmonary embolism <1%, rectal injury <1%, urethral stricture <5%, and transfusion 20%. Long term complications that are common and specific to a prostatectomy include the following:\n\nSurgical removal of the prostate contains an increased likelihood that patients will experience erectile dysfunction. Radical prostatectomy is associated with greater decrease in sexual function than external beam radiotherapy. Nerve-sparing surgery reduces the risk that patients will experience erectile dysfunction. However, the experience and the skill of the nerve-sparing surgeon, as well as any surgeon are critical determinants of the likelihood of positive erectile function of the patient.\n\nFollowing a prostatectomy, patients will not be able to ejaculate semen due to the nature of the procedure, resulting in the permanent necessity of assisted reproductive techniques in case of desires of future fertility. Preservation of normal ejaculation is possible after TUR prostatectomy, open or laser enucleation of adenoma and laser vaporisation of prostate. However, retrograde ejaculation is a common problem. Preservation of ejaculation is the aim of some new techniques. Once the prostate and vesicles are removed, even if partial erection is achieved, ejaculation is a very different experience, with little of the compulsive release that is common to ejaculation with those organs intact.\n\nProstatectomy patients have an increased risk of leaking small amounts of urine immediately after surgery, and for the long-term, often requiring urinary incontinence devices such as condom catheters or diaper pads. A large analysis of the incidence of urinary incontinence found that 12 months after surgery, 75% of patients needed no pad, while 9%-16% did. Factors associated with increased risk of long-term urinary incontinence include older age, higher BMI, more comorbidities, larger prostates surgically excised, as well as experience and technique of the surgeon. One study proved that radical prostatectomy was associated with more urinary incontinence than external beam radiotherapy, an alternative treatment.\n\nSurgical management options for urinary incontinence secondary to prostatectomy include implantation of perineal slings and artificial urinary sphincters. Although there are limited data on the long-term outcomes in males, perineal slings are offered for mild-to-moderate post-prostatectomy incontinence. In a retrospective study the success rate of perineal sling placement in urinary incontinence following prostatectomy achieved 86% at a median follow-up of 22 months. Artificial urinary sphincters are offered for moderate-to-severe urinary incontinence in males and have shown good long-term efficacy and safety. The use of artificial urinary sphincters for post-prostatectomy incontinence is supported by the recommendations of European Association of Urology and International Consultation on Incontinence.\n\nTransurethral injection of bulking agents have little role in the management of post-prostatecromy incontinence and there is weak evidence that these agents can offer any improvement. Pelvic floor muscle training can speed recovery of urinary incontinence following prostatectomy.\n\nVery few surgeons will claim that patients return to the erectile experience they had prior to surgery. The rates of erectile recovery that surgeons often cite are qualified by the addition of Viagra to the recovery regimen.\n\nRemedies to the problem of post-operative sexual dysfunction include:\n\nThe use of radical prostatectomy as treatment for prostate cancer increased significantly from 1980 to 1990. As of 2000, the median age of men undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was 62.\n\nThough a very common procedure, the experience level of the surgeon performing the operation is important in determining the outcomes, rate of complications, and side effects. The more prostatectomies performed by a surgeon, the better the outcomes. This is true for prostatectomies done as open procedures and those done using minimally invasive techniques.\n\nWilliam Belfield, MD is generally credited for performing the first intentional prostatectomy via the suprapubic route in 1885, 1886 or 1887 at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. Hugh H. Young MD in collaboration with William Stewart Halsted MD developed the open, radical and perineal prostatectomies in 1904 at Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute, the first version of the procedure that became generally feasible. The Irish surgeon Terence Millin, MD (1903–1980) developed the radical retropubic prostatectomy in 1945. American urologist Patrick C. Walsh, MD (1938—present) developed the modern nerve-sparing, retropubic prostatectomy with minimal blood loss. The first laparoscopic prostatectomy was performed in 1991 by William Schuessler, MD and colleagues in Texas.\n\nA 2014 survey of prostatectomy fees for uninsured patients at 70 United States hospitals found an average facility fee of $34,720 and average surgeon and anesthesiologist fees of $8,280.\n\n\n"}

American officials allege that he has ties to al Qaeda, and have sought his extradition to the United States, which is supported by the British Government. After his internment in Broadmoor Hospital in 2008, in 2010 the European Court of Human Rights blocked efforts to extradite Aswat due to concerns over the conditions of his potential imprisonment in the United States. This decision was upheld on 11 September 2013, meaning that he can not be extradited while under treatment for paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nHaroon Rashid Aswat, a British Gujarati Muslim, was born in the UK in 1979 (some sources quote dates as early as 1974), to a South Asian family, and was raised in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, on leaving school he moved to Wood Green, London.\n\nFrom 1995 he became associated with Abu Hamza al-Masri and the Finsbury Park Mosque. There, he helped to organise 200 British-based men of Pakistani origin to engage in terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. The group later deployed to Bosnia to join Abdelkader Mokhtari's new battalion Harkat ul-Ansar, based in Zenica.\n\nIn 1999 together with Abu Hamza and American-born convert James Ujaama, the three attempted to buy land in Oregon, United States to build a training camp for young Muslims. During this period Aswat lived in Seattle, Washington for over a month, and it is alleged that he was an MI6 informant.\n\nAfter the project failed, he began a period of travel around the world. By 2002 he was at a religious school in Lahore, hosted by Mohammed al-Ghabra. In November 2004 he met in Pakistan with the ringleader of the London 7/7 attack, Mohammad Sidique Khan, and accomplice Shehzad Tanweer.\n\nBy late 2004/early 2005 Aswat was resident in South Africa. US authorities tried to extradite him with regards the Oregon camp project, but as he was a British Citizen who had committed no crimes in South Africa, the South African authorities refused the extradition request. After the London 7/7 bombings, local South African newspapers reported that Aswat had been living a quiet life there for at least five months. Neighbors and co-workers described Aswat as \"a family man\" and said that he showed no apparent interest in radical Islamic politics.\n\nIn late June 2005 he arrived in the UK, through the Port of Felixstowe. He then left again via Heathrow Airport on 7 July 2005 for India, hours before the July 2005 London bombings.\n\nAmerican counter-terrorism officials state that they began investigating Aswat in 2002. In reporting on Oussama Kassir's 2009 trial \"Oregon Live\" described Lebanese-born Swedish militant Kassir and Aswat taking a bus from the east coast to Oregon. According to The Sunday Herald, by 1999, Aswat was calling himself a \"hit man\" for bin Laden. \n\nAmerican and British counter-terrorism officials stated that they found Aswat's passport on a man killed in action in Afghanistan in early 2003, and believed him to be Aswat.\n\nIn the first two weeks following the 7 July 2005 bombings, police sources initially told newspapers that Aswat made some 20 mobile phone calls to two of the suspected bombers just hours before the blasts. On 31 July 2005, following a more thorough forensic analysis of the remains of the bombers' phones, \"The Times\" reported that: \"British investigators, examining whether telephone calls were made between the London bombers and Aswat before the attacks of 7/7, caution that the calls may have been made to a phone linked to Aswat, rather than the man himself.\"\n\nThe \"New York Times\" quoted unnamed security officials that when Aswat's presence was brought to the attention of American authorities, that they wanted to subject him to an extraordinary rendition.\nThe \"New York Times\" sources said British officials objected, stating that \"He's got U.K. papers, and they said you can't render somebody with U.K. papers.\"\n\nOn 29 July 2005, during an interview on \"Fox News\" a former US prosecutor named John Loftus, asserted that Aswat was a double agent, backed by MI6. Loftus claimed that MI6 intervened to protect Aswat while he was trying to evade capture.\n\nHaving travelled via Pakistan, Aswat was arrested in Zambia on 20 July 2005. He was deported from Zambia to the UK on 7 August 2005 and arrested on his arrival. Following Aswat's capture his family issued a press release, stating that Aswat \"has not lived at this house and we have not had contact with him for many years... there is no story that we can provide.\"\n\nOnce Aswat was transferred to the United Kingdom, he was held in detention on a U.S. arrest warrant. American justice officials sought to try Aswat for his alleged role in setting up the Oregon training camp in 1999.\n\nA British judge approved Aswat's extradition on 30 November 2006, discounting the concern Aswat's lawyers expressed that there was \"a real risk\" Aswat would face inhumane treatment in U.S. custody. But in 2008 he was transferred to Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric hospital after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nIn 2010 the European Court of Human Rights blocked the extradition orders of Aswat, Abu Hamza, Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan.\n\nOn 16 April 2013, the European Court of Human Rights decided that Aswat's extradition to the U. S. would violate his right for protection against inhumane treatment, given his mental state. The UK Government appealed for the case to be reconsidered by the court's Grand Chamber, but on 11 September 2013 that was rejected, making the decision became final that Aswat cannot now be extradited.\n\n"}

Battle Harbour was for two centuries the economic and social centre of the southeastern Labrador coast. Mercantile saltfish premises first established there in the 1770s developed into a thriving community that was known as the \"Capital of Labrador\". It fell into decline following reductions in the cod fishery and a major fire in 1930, and was abandoned as a permanent settlement following government resettlement activity in the 1960s.\n\nThe Battle Harbour Historic Trust was given the fishing premises and other properties on the island, which it has preserved and operates as a museum. The facilities at Battle Harbour provide a commemoration of the life and society created there by Newfoundlanders and Labradorians during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The site has been declared a National Historic Site of Canada.\n\nBattle Harbour is located on Battle Island, facing a sheltered narrow strait separating that island from Great Caribou Island. It is thought that \"Battle Harbour\" is derived from the Portuguese word \"batal\", boat as depicted on Portuguese maps c. 1560. Battle Harbour is also known as \"Ca-tuc-to\" by the Inuit who had inhabited this part of Labrador.\n\nThe waterfront was the setting of much bustle and activity. It was used for the landing of marine resources harvested by local fishers, the processing of cod, salmon, seals and herring, the production of barrels, the packaging of fish products, the mending of nets and the production of saltfish. The \"flake\" or fish drying platform at Battle Harbour was the biggest such structure in all of Labrador. The Salt Store, the area's main warehouse for the salt used in the processing of several species, could hold up to 1,500 tons. The reconstructed waterfront buildings are reminiscent of an era now past but retain the history of years gone by and they also house an impressive collection of fisheries-related artifacts.\n\nThe Battle Harbour Historic District was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996. The ocean vistas and craggy rock outcrops are a dramatic backdrop for the small wooden church and houses that dot the landscape. Battle Harbour's \"hub\" is the wharf and the waterfront premises; rustic, wooden and shingle-clad buildings erected by English and Newfoundland-based merchants in the late 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe mercantile saltfish premises at Battle Harbour were established by the firm of John Slade and Company of Poole, England in the early 1770s. Lying just north of the old French Shore, Battle Harbour served as the gateway for Newfoundlanders seeking to fish in the resource rich waters of Labrador. The local population increased rapidly after 1820 when Newfoundland fishing schooners adopted Battle Harbour as their primary port of call and made it the recognized capital of the Labrador floater fishery. Battle Harbour remained in the hands of Slade and Co. until 1871, and during this time became a settled community, dominated by the fish merchants, but with its own evolving institutions, especially schools and churches.\n\nIn 1871 the Slades sold Battle Harbour to Baine, Johnston and Company Ltd. who operated the site in much the same manner until 1955. The activity of these two firms at Battle Harbour serve as an accurate microcosm of the history of Newfoundland and Labrador's fishery over almost two centuries.\n\nIn 1955 Baine, Johnston and Company Ltd. sold the premises to The Earle Freighting Service Ltd. who continued the site's operation until the decline in the inshore fishery at the start of the 1990s. At that time the site was donated to the Battle Harbour Historic Trust. The community's permanent residents had been relocated under a government-sponsored resettlement program from 1965 to 1970, although a number of families still use the site as a seasonal home.\nAccording to legend, Montagnais Indians, aided by the French, fought their final battle against the Inuit (c. 1760) at Battle Harbour. A burial mound is supposed to mark the site and some attribute its name from this historic event.\n\nThe exact time by which Battle Harbour became a European settlement is unknown, but it is believed that the French did not fish north of Cape Charles before 1718. Captain George Cartwright first visited Battle Harbour in May and June 1775, and recorded in his journal that a privateer had sacked Twillingate and \"came to Battle Harbour on this coast and had taken a sloop of Mr. Slade's with about twenty-two tuns of seals' oil on board and destroyed his goods there\". Later, in 1785, Cartwright had his provisions brought from Battle Harbour to Slink Point aboard a shallop belonging to the firm of Noble and Pinsent whose firm is believed to have had extensive fishery operations on the Labrador coast with base of operations at Chateau.\n\nA year after Dr. Wilfred Grenfell's visit to Battle Harbour in 1892 he built a hospital there. One of the first in Labrador, it opened for year-round service with a qualified doctor and nurse on staff in 1893. In 1896 a new wing was added from the remains of two wrecked vessels.\n\nIn the fall of 1930 Battle Harbour was destroyed by fire so devastating that, Grenfell stated, \"even the Marconi Pole on the top of the hill was burned\". The new school and the hospital were rebuilt at Mary's Harbour.\n\nIn 1851 Bishop Edward Field describes Battle Harbour as probably the oldest, as well as the largest settlement on the Labrador coast. The men who came and stayed there were generally from the Island of Newfoundland that used to bring with them servants from Dorset. Some of the first permanent residents were fishermen, carpenters and coopers from Poole, Dorset, Fogo Island and New World Island. As the community grew, there became an increasing need for supplies and merchants took full advantage of that where in some cases local residents paid as much as 100% beyond the regular cash price for goods. The exclusive monopoly was not challenged until 1918, when Battle Harbour's first co-operative was set up, through the initiative of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell.\n\nIn 1905 the first Newfoundland government lighthouse in Labrador, called Double Island Light, was set up at Battle Harbour, and in 1921 there was telegraph service installed.\nAfter the devastating fire of 1930 and the drastic decline of the fishery in 1950 and the prospect of employment elsewhere led to the resettlement of Battle Harbour in Mary's Harbour, Happy Valley and Epworth under the Fisheries Household Resettlement Programme of 1966.\n\nSince 1966 Battle Harbour has been a summer fishing station and in 1980 it was the site of a year-round government weather station.\n\nIn 1973 the St. John Ambulance originated their successful First Level Health Care Programme at Battle Harbour. This programme, based on teaching self-help health care and life-saving techniques to the people of isolated communities, received international recognition during its brief tenure, and was used as a model programme in over thirty countries in Africa, the Caribbean, the South Pacific and the Middle East.\n\n\n"}

He dons a suit of red armour and a helmet topped with a red feather when he goes into a battle. He is best known for the use of flaming substances in attacks, aided by five hundred soldiers trained in the technique. For this skill in setting his foes on fire, he is nicknamed \"General of Holy Fire\".\n\nGuan Sheng volunteers to take the fight to Lingzhou when Liangshan learns that Wei Dingguo and Shan Tingguo have been appointed by the Song court to eliminate them following their successful rescue of Lu Junyi in Daming which involved a city-wide rampage. The two instructors are recommended to Emperor Huizong by Grand Tutor Cai Jing.\n\nIn the first battle outside Lingzhou, Guan Sheng is rattled by the capture of his two lieutenants Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen by Wei Dingguo and Shan Tingguo. Xuan has been lured to ride into the ranks of Wei's soldiers, who quickly encircled and seized him. \n\nMeanwhile, Li Kui has sneaked out of Liangshan after being forbidden by Song Jiang to join Guan Sheng in the attack on Lingzhou.

While with Bao, they rescue Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen as the convoy escorting them to Dongjing for punishment passes Mount Deadwood. \n\nAt Lingzhou, the battle continues with Guan Sheng fighting Shan Tinggui one-on-one on horseback. Then Guan lures Shan to chase after him till they reach a remote spot where he turns and swings his big sabre to whack the latter off his horse. Instead of moving in to kill, Guan gets off his horse and shows Shan kind treatment, winning over the man. \n\nLeft standing alone, Wei Dingguo injures many of Guan's soldiers when his men unleash on them combustible materials such as sulphur. Just then, Li Kui, assisted by Jiao Ting, Bao Xu, Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen, attacks a gate of Lingzhou, causing the city to fall, when Wei is still outside of it. Wei flees to a nearby county and is determined to make his last stand there. Knowing that Wei would rather die than be humiliated, Shan Tinggui goes alone into the county to promise him dignified treatment if he gives in. But Wei insists that Guan Sheng come personally and unaccompanied to show sincerity. Guan obliges, thus convincing Wei to join Liangshan. \n\nWei Dingguo is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny come together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.\n\nIn the campaign against Fang La, Wei Dingguo and Shan Tinggui assist Lu Junyi in taking Xuanzhou (宣州; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) and Huzhou. They are later assigned to lead the attack on Shezhou, where they are lured into the finding its gate open and no one barring the way.

{"id": "2332247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332247", "title": "Pilot light", "text": "Pilot light\n\nA pilot light is a small gas flame, usually natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas, which serves as an ignition source for a more powerful gas burner. Originally, a pilot light was kept permanently alight; however, this is wasteful of gas. Now it is more common to light a burner electrically, but gas pilot lights are still used when a high energy ignition source is necessary, as in when lighting a large burner.\n\nThe term \"pilot light\" is also used occasionally for an electrical indicator light that illuminates to show that electrical power is available, or that an electrical device is operating. Such indicators were originally incandescent lamps or neon lamps, but now are usually LEDs.\n\nCommon applications include household water heaters, central heating systems, fireplaces, flamethrowers, and hot air balloons. While most commercial kitchens still rely on pilot lights for burners, ovens, and grills, current residential systems utilize an electrical ignition. This is more commonly known as standby on modern remote control fires.\n\nIn natural gas furnaces, water heaters, and room heating systems, a safety cut-off switch is normally included so that the gas supply to the pilot and heating system is shut off by an electrically operated valve if the pilot light goes out. This cut-off switch usually detects the pilot light in one of several ways:\n\nOther units use a non-electrical approach, where the pilot heats a bimetallic element or a gas-filled tube to exert mechanical pressure to keep the gas valve open. If the pilot fails, the valve closes. To restart the system, the valve must be held open manually and the pilot lit, and then the valve must be held open until the element heats up enough to hold the valve open. Non-electrical schemes are appropriate for systems that do not use electricity.\n\nThe above methods are examples of the use of \"fail-safe\" safety protection.\n\nIn domestic heating systems with pilot lights it has been estimated that half of the total energy usage is from the pilot light, with each pilot light on average using between 70 and 500 watts of gas power (between 8 and 16 gigajoules/year). The heat from a pilot light in many appliances (furnaces, space heaters, water heaters) is generally released in the same chamber as the primary burner.\nThe energy loss is much smaller for pilot lights in space heaters than other products, because space heaters heat a smaller enclosed space and contribute more significantly to heating the room. The appliance efficiency of a gas fired balanced flue local space heater in pilot light mode is almost equal with the appliance efficiency measured at the reduced power of the appliance, which efficiency is between 65 – 95% based on the low calorific value of the consumed gas, making part of the pilot light's energy consumption into a useful heat.\n\nAn alternative to the pilot light is a system to create a high voltage electrical arc or spark between two electrodes, in order to light the gas flowing to the burner. Fail-safe design for such a system requires the burner flame to be detected by passing an electric current through the flame, which is received by the flame rectification circuit inside an ignition controller connected to the gas valve. Flame rectification occurs when electrons flow through the flame burning, which the ignition controller senses and knows the flame is there, keeping the gas valve open. If the appliance loses gas or the flame goes out, the ignition controller doesn't see the flame, closing the gas valve.\n\nA red-hot surface can also be used to provide ignition. Such igniters are often made of silicon carbide, silicon nitride, or another material that is durable under prolonged exposure to extreme heat. Hot-surface igniters are commonly used in cooking ovens, boilers, and modern gas furnaces.\n\nA disadvantage to modern alternatives requiring high voltage is that the appliances are rendered useless during a power outage. Pilot light solutions work independently of the electrical system. However, some appliances can be lit with an external flame source during a power outage. This may include cooking stoves and ovens, but not heating boilers that are either room-sealed or rely on electricity to operate pumps.\n\nAnother disadvantage of using burning appliances connected to natural draught chimneys without pilot lights is the lack of the starting draught in the chimney. Without a pilot light the chimney can cool down completely to the outside temperature, therefore there is no chimney draught this case at all, or there can be even a negative chimney draught if the outside temperature is higher than the inner temperature in the house. This case there is a backflow in the chimney. This is the reason of feeling the smell of soot at summertime at the chimneys openings. If there is a backflow in the chimney, it is possible that the cool air and the hot flue gases both entering into the appliance’s room via the openings of the gas appliance draught diverter, which can cause high level of carbon-monoxide in the air of the room, resulting possible deaths or permanent disability. In such a situation there is no strong physical effect which would drive the flue gases into the chimney, so the power, which cause the backflow in the chimney can be determinative. According to statistics the “starting draught” in chimneys assured by the permanent pilots has an important role to prevent an increase in the number of carbon monoxide poisonings. So in case of open fired appliances and natural draught chimneys the goals of the energy savings and the safety aspects are opposite.\n"}

Nicknamed \"General of Sacred Water\", he ranks 44th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and eighth among the 72 Earthly Fiends.\n\nA military instructor in his hometown Lingzhou (凌州; in present-day Dezhou, Shandong) alongside Wei Dingguo, San Tinggui is a tough warrior who rides a black steed and fights with a long sabre. He dons a suit of black armour and a helmet topped with a black feather when he goes into a battle. He is best known for damming and diverting waterways to flood his enemies, aided by five hundred soldiers trained in the techniques. For this skill in channeling water to drown his foes, he is nicknamed \"General of Sacred Water\", \n\nGuan Sheng volunteers to take the fight to Lingzhou when Liangshan learns that Shan Tingguo and Wei Dingguo have been appointed by the Song court to eliminate them following their successful rescue of Lu Junyi in Daming which involved a city-wide rampage. The two instructors are recommended to Emperor Huizong by Grand Tutor Cai Jing.\n\nIn the first battle outside Lingzhou, Guan Sheng is rattled by the capture of his two lieutenants Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen by Wei Dingguo and Shan Tingguo. Hao has been lured to ride into the ranks of Shan's soldiers, who quickly encircled and seized him.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Kui has sneaked out of Liangshan after being forbidden by Song Jiang to join Guan Sheng in the attack on Lingzhou. He befriends Jiao Ting while on his way, who takes him to Bao Xu, who leads a bandit group at Mount Deadwood. While with Bao, they rescue Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen as the convoy escorting them to Dongjing for punishment passes Mount Deadwood.\n\nAt Lingzhou, the battle continues with Guan Sheng fighting Shan Tinggui one-on-one on horseback. Then Guan lures Shan to chase after him till they reach a remote spot where he turns and swings his big sabre to whack the latter off his horse. Instead of moving in to kill, Guan gets off his horse and shows Shan kind treatment, winning over the man.\n\nLeft standing alone, Wei Dingguo injures many of Guan's soldiers when his men unleash on them flaming materials. Just then, Li Kui, assisted by Jiao Ting, Bao Xu, Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen, attacks a gate of Lingzhou, causing the city to fall, when Wei is still outside of it. Wei flees to a nearby county and is determined to make his last stand there. Knowing that Wei would rather die than be humiliated, Shan Tinggui goes alone into the county to promise him dignified treatment if he gives in. But Wei insists that Guan Sheng come personally and unaccompanied to show sincerity. Guan obliges, thus convincing Wei to join Liangshan.\n\nShan Tinggui is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny come together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.\n\nIn the campaign against Fang La, Shan Tinggui and Wei Dingguo assist Lu Junyi in taking Xuanzhou (宣州; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) and Huzhou. They are later assigned to lead the attack on Shezhou, where they are lured into the city finding its gate open and no one barring the way.

{"id": "2332260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332260", "title": "Greengates School", "text": "Greengates School\n\nGreengates School () is a British-style international school located in the Balcones de San Mateo neighbourhood in Naucalpan, located north-west of Mexico City metropolitan area, in the State of Mexico. As of 2015, it has approximately 1,150 students of some 60 nationalities, derived mainly from the diplomatic and international business communities. During forms 4 and 5 (grades 9 and 10 in the American System), students study for the IGCSE (International General Certificate of Secondary Education) examinations, while in their last two years of high school (Sixth form), students prepare for the International Baccalaureate Diploma.\n\nThe school preserves the philosophy of its founding statement: \"...to provide an education for students which seeks not only to impart knowledge by the means of acquiring knowledge; to develop character and personality through self-discipline and service; to equip its pupils not only to earn their living but also to live creatively and happily in the world which they must inherit\". The campus is perhaps the most international area in Mexico, catering for some 60 different nationalities. \n\nRecently the school has acquired more land, modernised its facilities and has leading edge technology, without increasing the number of students.\n\nGreengates School is nowadays regarded as more of an academic school in Mexico with satisfactory achievements in both IGCSE and IB courses.\n\nGreengates School was founded by Edward Foulkes and his partner Frank Whitbourn in a house in Lomas de Chapultepec in 1951. Originally, the school had no uniform and only one school bus. Over the years, it moved several times to accommodate an increasingly larger enrolment. The school, originally meant to cater to the sons of British and Commonwealth diplomats and citizens in Mexico City, was becoming more popular with wealthy Mexicans living in Lomas de Chapultepec who sought a high standard of education for their children, which they found at Greengates.\n\nIn 1961, Foulkes left to start a new school, what would become the Edron Academy in the south-west region of the city. Henry Coelho bought his stake and began transforming the school. Soon afterwards, Andre Desouches bought Whitbourn's stake, and the Coehlo and Desouches families continue to own the majority of the school. Henry Coelho stepped down as managing director in 2007, a post he held for over 40 years, and was replaced by Dr Clarisa Desouches, university professor of sociology and the daughter of Andre Desouches.\n\nThe initial parcel of land upon which the current San Mateo campus was built was bought in 1964. The project, designed by architect Innes Webster, broke ground December 1969, with the first brick laid by HE the British Ambassador Sir Peter Hope, while Andre Desouches was headmaster. The final project was completed in 1971, although the school has undergone major renovation and expansion. A domed room, called 'The Dome', used as an alternate concert venue to the gymnasium and as the biggest examination hall, was built as a third floor on top of the science laboratories in 1997. In 2001, a further six-room expansion was made at the back of the Senior Block.\n\nIn 2010, a plot of land was purchased at the end of the school to increase green spaces. The land underwent turfing and several picnic tables were placed on the new lawn. In addition, a huge structure designed by famous organic architect Prof Javier Senosiain, named \"Moctezuma's Lion\" was placed to the right of the lawn and was designed to integrate a piece of art with a playground so children can climb and play on its stylised benches, steps and slides, which represent the arms, legs, and body of the lion.\n\nKinder 1–3, as well as Junior 1, form the infant school. The Kinders finish school at 13:30, while the rest of the school ends at 14:45. They study subjects such as mathematics and English.\n\nThe primary school consists of the years Junior 2–5, and no longer follows the PYP. The IPC has now been implemented at the school.\n\nIn recent years, a number of \"firsts\" have been achieved. For example, the first overnight trip, the first play, first \"museum\" show, among other major projects. In addition, the outgoing primary schoolers enjoy an \"Experience Day\", where they get a taste of the life in secondary school.\n\nForms I-III take part of the secondary School and offer traditional disciplines like mathematics, the sciences, music, art, French, and English.\n\nForm IV, form V, lower VI, and upper VI are the continuation and are a part of the secondary school, equivalent to a four-year high school in the American system. The third formers choose their IGCSE subjects towards the end of the year, and concentrate on their options over the next two years, before becoming IGCSE candidates at the end of Form V (except for advanced mathematians, who take the extended IGCSE Mathematics examinations at the end of Form IV, before taking the additional mathematics papers at the end of Form V). Students are expected to sit eight to ten IGCSEs, and must pass five in order to pursue the IB at the school.\n\nThe Lower/Upper VIs study the IB. They choose six subjects according to the IB programme, and many top students opt to take four higher level courses, as opposed to the standard three. Subjects offered at the IB level include French literature, Japanese literature, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, economics, psychology, history etc. Other subjects, such as anthropology, film studies, and business & management, are offered based on teacher availability and demand from prospective candidates.\n\nThere are four school houses: Whitbourne (yellow), Foulkes (white), Brightman (blue), and Edinburgh (red). The first two are named in honour of the founders, the third after the first headmaster and the fourth in honour of Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, who visited the school at its original Lomas de Chapultepec location in 1965. Every year, pupils compete in different sports such as football, basketball, track and field events, rugby, and swimming competitions for the House Cup, which is awarded on Speech Day, the last day of school.\n\nOne of the most important annual events the school organises is the International Fair, where thousands of students, teachers, and parents from different nationalities unite to create a day filled with music, dancing, food, and culture from all around the globe. The Fair features national stands, staffed by the school's families and teachers, which offer national clothes, toys and trinkets for sale as well as the country's culinary delicacies. Some of the permanent stands include the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Brazil, Israel, Vietnam, Argentina, Poland, United States, India, South Korea, Spain, France, Sweden, and Canada. Other stands change every year, such as El Salvador, Chile, China, Denmark, Nigeria, Pakistan and Switzerland, due to the smaller presence of these countries at the school.\n\nGreengates School is recognised for its students' consistent high scores on the IGCSE and IB programmes, and its graduates gaining regular acceptance into top universities all over the world such as Yale, Princeton, Stanford and UC Berkeley in the United States and Cambridge, St Andrews, Imperial and LSE in the United Kingdom, among many others.\n\nStudents also attend top universities in Mexico City like ITESM, UNAM, ITAM, Universidad Iberoamericana and Escuela Libre de Derecho with Medicine, Law, Economics and Business Management being the most popular career choices.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332270", "title": "North and South (Gaskell novel)", "text": "North and South (Gaskell novel)\n\nNorth and South is a social novel published in 1854 by English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. With \"Wives and Daughters\" (1865) and \"Cranford\" (1853), it is one of her best-known novels and was adapted for television three times (1966, 1975 and 2004). The 2004 version renewed interest in the novel and attracted a wider readership.\n\nGaskell's first novel, \"Mary Barton\" (1848), focused on relations between employers and workers in Manchester from the perspective of the working poor; \"North and South\" uses a protagonist from southern England to present and comment on the perspectives of mill owners and workers in an industrializing city. The novel is set in the fictional industrial town of Milton in the north of England. Forced to leave her home in the tranquil, rural south, Margaret Hale settles with her parents in Milton. She witnesses the brutal world wrought by the Industrial Revolution, seeing employers and workers clashing in the first strikes. Sympathetic to the poor (whose courage and tenacity she admires and among whom she makes friends), she clashes with John Thornton: a \"nouveau riche\" cotton-mill owner who is contemptuous of his workers. The novel traces her growing understanding of the complexity of labour relations and their influence on well-meaning mill owners and her conflicted relationship with John Thornton. Gaskell based her depiction of Milton on Manchester, where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister.\n\n\"North and South\" originally appeared in 20 weekly episodes from September 1854 to January 1855 in \"Household Words\", edited by Charles Dickens. During this period Charles Dickens dealt with the same theme in Hard Times (also a social novel), which was published in the same magazine from April to August 1854.\n\n\"Hard Times\", which shows Manchester (the satirical Coketown) in a negative light, challenged Gaskell and made the writing of her own novel more difficult; she had to ascertain that Dickens would not write about a strike. Gaskell found the time and technical constraints of serialized fiction particularly trying. She had planned to write 22 episodes but was \"compelled to desperate compression\" to limit the story to 20. \"North and South\" was less successful than \"Hard Times\". On 14 October 1854, after six weeks, sales dropped so much that Dickens complained about what he called Gaskell's \"intractability\" because she resisted his demands for conciseness. He found the story \"wearisome to the last degree\".\n\nThe novel's title (imposed by Dickens) focuses on the difference in lifestyle between rural southern England, inhabited by the landed gentry and agricultural workers, and the industrial north, populated by capitalist manufacturers and poverty-stricken mill workers; the north-south division was cultural and geographical. The story centers on haughty Margaret Hale, who learns to overcome her prejudices against the North in general and charismatic manufacturer John Thornton in particular. Gaskell would have preferred to call the novel \"Margaret Hale\" (as she had done in 1848 for her novel \"Mary Barton\"), but Dickens prevailed. He wrote in a 26 July 1854 letter that \"North South\" seemed better, encompassing more and emphasizing the opposition between people who are forced by circumstances to meet face-to-face.\n\nWorking on the final chapters of the novel in December at Lea Hurst, Florence Nightingale's family home near Matlock in Derbyshire, Gaskell wrote that she would rather call her novel \"Death and Variations\" because \"there are five dead, each beautifully consistent with the personality of the individual\". This remark, although probably a joke, emphasizes the importance of death in the story. Death affects Margaret profoundly, gradually encouraging her independence; this allows Gaskell to analyse the character's deep emotions and focus on the social system's harshness in the deaths of Boucher and Bessy.\n\nChapman & Hall (London) first published the novel in 1855 as two volumes of 25 and 27 chapters each. That year, Harper and Brothers published it in New York and Tauchnitz published the more-complete second edition in Leipzig as part of a \"Collection of English Writers\". Many editions were published during Gaskell's lifetime.\n\nThe text in the book, particularly the ending, differs significantly from that of the serialized episodes. Gaskell included a brief preface saying that due to the restrictive magazine format, she could not develop the story as she wished: \"Various short passages have been inserted, and several new chapters added\". She tried to eliminate the limitations of a serialized novel by elaborating on events after the death of Mr. Hale and adding four chapters: the first and last chapters and two chapters on the visits by Mr. Bell to London and by Margaret and Mr. Bell to Helstone. This edition also adds chapter titles and epigraphs. The preface concludes with a quotation from the conclusion of John Lydgate's Middle-English fable, \"The Churl and the Bird\" (spelling modernised).\n\nLoreau and Mrs. H. of Lespine, \"with the authorization of the Author,\" translated the novel into French using the first revised edition. It was published in Paris by Hachette in 1859, and reprinted at least twice: in 1860 as \"Marguerite Hale (Nord et Sud)\" and in 1865 as \"Nord et Sud.\"\n\nNineteen-year-old Margaret Hale lived for almost 10 years in London with her cousin Edith and her wealthy Aunt Shaw, but when Edith marries Captain Lennox, Margaret happily returns home to the southern village of Helstone. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother Henry, an up-and-coming barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone as a matter of conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend from Oxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns the property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and is in the middle of the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organized strikes.\n\nMargaret initially finds the bustling, smoky town of Milton harsh and strange, and she is upset by its poverty. Mr. Hale (in reduced financial circumstances) works as a tutor; one of his pupils is the wealthy and influential manufacturer John Thornton, master of Marlborough Mills. From the outset, Margaret and Thornton are at odds with each other; she sees him as coarse and unfeeling, and he sees her as haughty. He is attracted to her beauty and self-assurance, however, and she begins to admire how he has risen from poverty.\n\nDuring the 18 months she spends in Milton, Margaret gradually learns to appreciate the city and its hard-working people, especially Nicholas Higgins (a union representative) and his daughter Bessy, whom she befriends. Bessy is ill with byssinosis from inhaling cotton dust, which eventually kills her.\n\nA workers' strike ensues. An outraged mob of workers breaks into Thornton's compound, where he has his home and his factory, after he imports Irish workers as replacements. Thornton sends for soldiers, but before they arrive, Margaret begs him to talk to the mob to try to avoid bloodshed. When he appears to be in danger, Margaret rushes out and shields him; she is struck by a stone. The mob disperses, and Thornton carries the unconscious Margaret indoors.\n\nThornton proposes; Margaret declines, unprepared for his unexpected declaration of love and offended by assumptions that her action in front of the mob meant that she cares for him. Thornton's mother, wary of Margaret's haughty ways, is galled by Margaret's rejection of her son.\n\nMargaret's brother Frederick (who lives in exile as he is wanted for his part in a naval mutiny) secretly visits their dying mother. Thornton sees Margaret and Frederick together and assumes that he is her lover. Leonards, Frederick's shipmate, later recognizes Frederick at the train station. They argue; Frederick pushes Leonards away, and Leonards dies shortly afterward. When the police question Margaret about the scuffle she lies and says she was not present. Thornton knows that Margaret lied, but in his capacity as magistrate declares the case closed to save her from possible perjury. Margaret is humbled by his deed on her behalf; she no longer only looks down on Thornton as a hard master and begins to recognize the depth of his character.\n\nNicholas, at Margaret's prodding, approaches Thornton for a job and eventually obtains one. Thornton and Higgins learn to appreciate and understand each other. \n\nMr. Hale visits his oldest friend, Mr. Bell, in Oxford. He dies there, and Margaret returns to live in London with Aunt Shaw. She visits Helstone with Mr. Bell and asks him to tell Thornton about Frederick, but Mr. Bell dies before he can do so. He leaves Margaret a legacy which includes Marlborough Mills and the Thornton house.\n\nThornton faces bankruptcy due to market fluctuations and the strike. He learns the truth about Margaret's brother from Nicholas Higgins and comes to London to settle his business affairs with Margaret, his new landlord. When Margaret offers Thornton the loan of her money, he realizes that her feelings toward him have changed, and he again proposes marriage. Since she has learned to love him, she accepts.\n\n\nIn her introduction to \"The Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell\" (2007), a collection of essays representing current Gaskell scholarship, Jill L. Matus stresses the author's growing stature in Victorian literary studies and how her innovative, versatile storytelling addressed the rapid changes during her lifetime. It was not always that way; her reputation from her death to the 1950s was dominated by Lord David Cecil's assessment in \"Early Victorian Novelists\" (1934) that she was \"all woman\" and \"makes a creditable effort to overcome her natural deficiencies but all in vain\".\n\nContemporary reviews were critical, similar to those of \"Mary Barton\". A scathing, unsigned critique in \"The Leader\" accused Gaskell of making errors about Lancashire which a resident of Manchester would not make and said that a woman (or clergymen and women) could not \"understand industrial problems\", would \"know too little about the cotton industry\" and had no \"right to add to the confusion by writing about it\".\n\nAfter reading the fifth episode, Charlotte Brontë believed that it was only about the church and \"the defense of those who in conscience, disagree with it and consider it their duty to leave\". However, Brontë acknowledged that her friend \"understands the genius of the North\". Although Richard Holt acknowledged some interest in the novel in \"The Critical Review\", he complained that its plot is disjointed and the characters change by leaps and bounds \"in the manner of kangaroos\". George Sand said that the novel could interest a gentleman while being accessible to a young woman.\n\nGaskell's novels, with the exception of \"Cranford\", gradually slipped into obscurity during the late 19th century; before 1950, she was dismissed as a minor author with \"good judgment and feminine sensibilities\". Archie Stanton Whitfield wrote that her work was \"like a nosegay of violets, honeysuckle, lavender, mignonette and sweet briar\" in 1929, and Cecil said that she lacked the \"masculinity\" necessary to properly deal with social problems. However, the tide began to turn in Gaskell's favor when, in the 1950s and 60s, socialist critics like Kathleen Tillotson, Arnold Kettle and Raymond Williams re-evaluated the description of social and industrial problems in her novels, and—realizing that her vision went against the prevailing views of the time—saw it as preparing the way for vocal feminist movements.\nIn the early 21st century, with Gaskell's work \"enlisted in contemporary negotiations of nationhood as well as gender and class identities\", \"North and South\", one of the first industrial novels describing a conflict between employers and workers, is seen as depicting complex social conflicts and offering more satisfactory solutions through Margaret Hale: spokesperson for the author and Gaskell's most mature creation.\n\nThe change in title of Gaskell's fourth novel from \"Margaret Hale\" to Dickens' suggested \"North and South\" underscores its theme of modernity versus tradition. Until the end of the 18th century, power in England was in the hands of the aristocracy and landed gentry based in the south. The Industrial Revolution unsettled the centuries-old class structure, shifting wealth and power to manufacturers who mass-produced goods in the north. Cities such as Manchester, on which Gaskell modeled her fictional Milton, were hastily developed to house workers who moved from the semi-feudal countryside to work in the new factories. The south represents the past (tradition): aristocratic landowners who inherited their property, collected rent from farmers and peasants and assumed an obligation for their tenants' welfare. The north represents the future (modernity): its leaders were self-made men like Gaskell's hero, John Thornton, who accumulated wealth as working, middle-class entrepreneurs. In their view, philanthropy or charity – giving something for nothing – was a dangerous imbalance of the relationship between employers and employees (which was based on the exchange of cash for labour).\n\nRebellion against an authority seen as unfair is woven throughout the story. Established institutions are seen as inhumane or selfish, and therefore fallible; Mr. Hale breaks with the church on a matter of conscience, and Frederick Hale participates in a mutiny against the navy and is forced into exile because the law would hang him for what he considered a just cause. His rebellion parallels the strike by workers who take up the cause to feed their children. Both are impotent and engaged in a struggle (a war, in the eyes of the workers) whose terms are dictated by those who maintain their power by force: the law and the mill masters. Margaret rebels in ways that express her liberty: ignoring social proprieties and challenging authority by lying to the police to protect her brother, from whom she learns that arbitrary, unjust, and cruel power can be defied not for oneself but on behalf of the unfortunate. Even Mrs. Hale rebels in her own way; she is \"prouder of Frederick standing up against injustice, than if he had been simply a good officer\".\n\nThe theme of power is also central. Thornton represents three aspects of power and the authority of the ruling class: a manufacturer respected by his peers (economic power), a magistrate (judicial power) and someone who can summon the army (political power) to quell the strike. There is energy, power and courage in the struggle for a better life by Milton's residents. Margaret demonstrates power in her verbal jousting with Thornton, forcing him to reflect on the validity of his beliefs and eventually change his view of workers from mere providers of labour to individuals capable of intelligent thought. When she reaches age 21, Margaret takes control of her life, resolves to live as she chooses, and learns how to manage wealth inherited from Mr. Bell.\n\nThe notion of separate spheres dominated Victorian beliefs about gender roles, assuming that the roles of men and women are clearly delineated. Public life (including work) is within the masculine domain, and private life (domesticity) is within the feminine. The expression of feelings is considered feminine, and aggression is seen as masculine. Resolving conflict with words is feminine, and men are likely to resort to physical resolution (including war). The mistress of the home is the guardian of morality and religion and \"The Angel in the House\". The public sphere is considered dangerously amoral and, in the work of authors such as Dickens, disasters ensue when characters do not conform to contemporary standards.\n\nThis notion is questioned in \"North and South\". In Margaret Hale, the separation is blurred and she is forced by circumstances to assume a masculine role, organizing the family's departure from Helstone and assuming much of the responsibility for the family in Milton (including encouraging her father). She carries the load alone, behaving like a \"Roman girl\" because Mr. Hale is weak and irresolute. When Higgins slips away and her father trembles with horror at Boucher's death, Margaret goes to Mrs. Boucher, breaks the news of her husband's death, and cares for the family with dedication and efficiency. She summons her brother Frederick, a naval officer who is crushed with grief at the death of his mother. To protect her brother, Margaret later lies about their presence at the train station on the day of his departure.\n\nThornton and Higgins, while not denying their masculinity, demonstrate compassion. Higgins in particular, whom Thornton considers among \"mere demagogues, lovers of power, at whatever costs to others\", assumes the responsibility for raising the Boucher children and embodies maternal tenderness (lacking in Mrs. Thornton) and strength (not possessed by Mrs. Hale) and dignity. Gaskell endows John Thornton with tenderness (a soft spot, according to Nicholas Higgins). Although Thornton's pride hides this capacity from public view, he shows it in his affection for his mother and his quiet attention to the Hales. He expresses it more obvious when he later develops relations with his workers beyond the usual cash-for-labour, builds a canteen for the workers, and sometimes shares meals with them. Margaret and Thornton's evolution eventually converges and, after learning humility, they are partially freed from the shackles of separate spheres; he develops friendly relations at the mill, and she asserts her independence from her cousin's life. Margaret initiates their business meeting, which he interprets as a declaration of love. In the final scene, she controls the financial situation and he reacts emotionally. They now meet as man and woman, no longer the manufacturer from the north and the lady from the south. The blurring of roles is also evident among the workers, many of whom (like Bessy) are women.\n\nCertain family relationships are emphasized (Margaret and her father, Higgins and Bessy, Mrs. Hale and Frederick), all interrupted by death. The tie between Thornton and his mother is particularly deep and, on Mrs. Thornton's side, exclusive and boundless: \"her son, her pride, her property\". Ordinarily cold, she tells him: \"Mother's love is Given by God, John. It holds fast forever and ever\". Parent-child relationships are often metaphors for relations between employers and workers in Victorian literature. In chapter XV, \"Men and Master\", Margaret rejects this paternalistic view (expressed by Thornton) as infantilizing the worker. She favors, instead, helping workers grow and become emancipated. Friendships between people of different social classes, education and cultural backgrounds (between Mr. Hale and Thornton, Margaret and Bessy, and Thornton and Higgins) prefigure Gaskell's desired human relations which blur class distinctions. Margaret performs \"lowly\" tasks and Dixon a confidante of Mrs. Hale, who develops a relationship of respect, affection, and understanding with the maid.\n\nGaskell, the daughter, and wife of a pastor, did not write a religious novel, although religion plays an important role in her work. Unitarians interpreted biblical texts symbolically, rather than literally. They did not believe in original sin or that women were guiltier or weaker than men, and were more liberal than Methodists, Anglicans or Dissenters. \"North and South\" presents a typical picture of Unitarian tolerance in one evening scene: \"Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the Dissenter, Higgins the Infidel, knelt down together\". The Thorntons do not invoke religion as the Hales do, although Mrs. Thornton reads Matthew Henry's \"Exposition of the Old and New Testaments\". Although the re-institution in 1850 by Pope Pius IX of a Roman Catholic hierarchy in England was generally strongly condemned, Gaskell has an open mind about Catholicism and Frederick Hale converts to his Spanish wife's religion.\n\nBiblical references appear in several forms. Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); there is an allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity (\"that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own\") from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: \"It won't be division enough, in that awful day, that some of us have been beggars here, and some of us have been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ\". Margaret and Thornton follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their \"unworthiness\". Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes. Francis de Sales encourages her to seek \"the way of humility\", despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimize and rationalize her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, on the brink of ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation (\"Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very\") and gives fervent thanks for the \"great blessing\" his existence gives her.\n\nThe influence of Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" on \"North and South\" is frequently noted. In \"The Politic of Stories in Victorian Fiction\" (1988), Rosemarie Bodenheimer writes that she prefers to study the novel's relationship with Charlotte Brontë's \"Shirley\" but sees in the \"description of strong domestic qualities\" and \"social optimism\" an industrial \"Pride and Prejudice\". Patricia Ingham also compares \"North and South\" to \"Shirley\". Ann Banfield compares \"North and South\" to \"Mansfield Park\" for two reasons: Margaret Hale, like Fanny Price, is transplanted in a place she conquers, and the novel is built on an opposition of places on a larger scale.\n\nThe novel has three beginnings, two of them illusory: the first is the wedding preparation in London, the second the heroine's return to Helstone and the third (often considered the real start of the story) narrates the departure for Milton in chapter seven. The first chapters, according to Martin Dodsworth, are false leads of what the novel is about rather than the author's clumsiness; they tell the reader what the story is \"not\" about. Bodenheimer interprets the early chapters not as false starts but as demonstrating Gaskell's theme of societal and personal \"permanent state(s) of change\" and integral to the novel. The early chapters in different places have been interpreted as presenting a theme of mobility. In moving from one place to another Margaret better understands herself and the world, advancing Gaskell's intention to place her in the public sphere.\n\nThe opening chapters of \"North and South\" indicate an apparent novel of manners in the style of Jane Austen, with preparations for the marriage in London of a silly bride and a lively, intelligent heroine; in the country village of Helstone (a fictional place in the English county of Hampshire), a bachelor in search of fortune (Henry Lennox) woos – and is rejected by – Margaret. Deirdre David, in \"Fictions of Resolution in Three Victorian Novels\" (1981), suggests that Margaret's abandonment of London society indicates that she is out of place in the south and her adjustment to the north is plausible.\n\nGaskell's novel of manners has the broader context of an industrial novel about the north-west of England, where young girls (like Bessy) die of \"cotton consumption\"; capitalists disregard legal obligations, and workers refuse prophylactic facilities, instigate strikes and foment riots. It can be criticized, as by Martin Dodsworth, for giving the love affair precedence over the industrial context and for dwelling on the emotional conflict between Margaret and Thornton. However, \"North and South\" is not simply an industrial \"Pride and Prejudice\" Margaret acquires stature and a public role, challenging the Victorian idea of separate spheres. She befriends Bessy Higgins (a young, working-class woman), gradually abandons her aversion to \"shoppy people\" and, recognizing Thornton's qualities, crosses social classes to consider herself \"not good enough\" for him. Although the novel ends in Harley Street (where it began), Margaret's estrangement from the vain, superficial world of her cousin Edith and Henry Lennox is emphasized by her choice of Thornton and Milton.\n\nAs the chapter titles \"First Impressions\", \"Mistakes\", \"Mistakes Cleared Up\", \"Mischances\" and \"Atonement\" indicate that \"North and South\" is peppered with Margaret's blunders and problematic situations with other characters which create misunderstandings. Some of Margaret's blunders stem from ignoring customs, some from not understanding them and still others from rejecting Milton's social customs (such as a frank, familiar handshake). Other characters fail to carry out important actions: Dixon does not tell Margaret that Thornton attended her mother's funeral, and Mr. Bell dies before he can explain to Thornton why Margaret lied. Margaret feels misunderstood, unable to take control of her life and explain a world she does not understand.\nOther gaffes are due to Margaret's ignorance; accustomed to London's chic salons, she is unaware that she is seen as wearing her shawl \"as an empress wears her drapery\" and serving tea with \"the air of a proud reluctant slave\". She receives marriage proposals awkwardly: Henry Lennox's declaration of love is \"unpleasant\" and makes her uncomfortable, and she feels \"offended\" and assaulted by John Thornton's proposal. Margaret naively believes that the rioters can be negotiated with and is unaware that she and her brother, Frederick, resemble a loving couple on a train-station platform (O'Farrell, 1997, p. 68). Bodenheimer sees this \"mistakenness\" as purposeful: \"In its every situation, whether industrial politics or emotional life, traditional views and stances break down into confusing new ones, which are rendered in all the pain of mistakenness and conflict that real human change entails\". Perhaps this is why Margaret's blunders do not always have negative consequences; when she admits she is disappointed that Thornton has refused to hire Higgins, she is ashamed that he hears her remark. Thornton reconsiders, eventually offering Higgins a job. In the final chapter, she does not seem to realize that a \"simple proposition\" to bail out the factory (a business arrangement) could hurt Thornton's pride or be seen as shocking from a \"lady\". Bodenheimer interprets scenes like this as \"deep confusion in a time of personal change and revision\" which brings the lovers together.\n\nThe first description of Marlborough Mills in Chapter XV is through Margaret's eyes and thoughts, and the omniscient narrator delves into the inner thoughts of her main characters and occasionally interjects her observations. Thornton \"thought that he disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly, but he was mistaken. It was a stinging pleasure to be in the room with her ... But he was no great analyzer of his own motives, and was mistaken as I have said\". The narrative sometimes slips into free indirect discourse; Mrs. Thornton silently calls Margaret's embroidery of a small piece of cambric \"flimsy, useless work\" when she visits the Hales.\n\nBodenheimer believes that the narrator is interested in the psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of \"interiority\" (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' \"trance of passion\". The phrase \"as if\" appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration: \"Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk\" and \"[Thornton] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical\". The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: \"As if she felt his look, she turned to him\"; \"He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it\", and \"She lifted up her head as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown\". Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins: \" ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart\".\n\nAccording to Bodenheimer, \"North and South\" narrative may sometimes appear melodramatic and sentimental (\"But, for all that—for all his savage words, he could have thrown himself at her feet, and kissed the hem of her garment\" in chapter 29)—particularly in the riot scene—but she sees Gaskell's best writing as \"done with the unjudging openness to experience\" which the author shares with D. H. Lawrence. Jill L. Matus finds Gaskell's vocabulary \"Gothicized\" in its descriptions of the characters' agonized inner life—their responses to suffering and pain—which may appear melodramatic out of context. However, \"the language of shock and horror is absorbed into the realist texture of the novel's narration\" and is consistent with the extreme conditions of the novel's external world.\n\nA number of 19th-century authors were interested in native dialects: Scottish for Sir Walter Scott, Irish for Maria Edgeworth. Gaskell, influenced by her husband's work, did not hesitate to give her Milton workers Mancunian expressions and vocabulary without going as far as Emily Brontë's transcription of Yorkshire pronunciation or Dickens' Yarmouth fishermen in \"David Copperfield\". She developed a reputation for the skilful use of dialect to indicate status, age or intimacy between speakers.\n\nMargaret's adaptation to the culture is demonstrated through language. When her mother reproaches her for using Milton's vulgar provincialisms (such as \"slack of work\"), Margaret replies that since she lives in an industrial city, she must speak its language when called on to do so. She cites a word which may be vulgar but which she finds expressive (\"knobstick\") and uses a local term (\"redding up\" – tidying) to Boucher's small children: \"redding up the slatternly room\". Gaskell begins each chapter with a poetic quote to accentuate a relevant theme, such as interior conflicts (\"My heart revolts within me, and two voices / Make themselves audible within my bosom\"—\"Wallenstein\", chapter XVIII), duality (\"On earth is known to none / The smile that is not sister to a tear.\" Elliott, chapter XXI), courtship, duty, suffering, steadfast courage, honesty, time and change.\n\nGaskell lived during the period of upheaval which followed the Industrial Revolution, and was aware of the difficult conditions of daily life and the health problems suffered by the workers of Manchester. \"North and South\" has been interpreted by Roberto Dainotto as \"a kind of apocalyptic journey into the inferno of the changing times—modern poverty, rage, desperation, militant trade unionism and class antagonism\". The strike described in \"North and South\" resembles the Preston strike, which occurred the year before the novel was published. The strike's slogan was \"ten percent and no surrender\", and it was led by George Cowell and Mortimer Grimshaw. Lasting nearly seven months (from September 1853 to April 1854), it was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe strike is described in detail, with intelligent leaders like Higgins, the desperate violence and savagery of the rioters, and the reactions of both sides. Through the eyes of Margaret, a horrified, compassionate outsider, Gaskell illustrates the social misery of the slums Margaret visits, misery occasionally documented in parliamentary papers (blue books) with suggestive illustrations which resulted in the Factory Act of 1833.\n\nGaskell uses a cause of conflict between masters and workers (the installation of ventilators in the carding rooms) to illustrate the greed of one and the ignorance of the other, making social progress difficult, and calls attention to anti-Irish prejudice in a city where the Irish are a small minority. She exposes the beliefs and reasoning of manufacturers in Thornton's defense of a theory approaching social Darwinism: capitalism as naturally (almost physically) obeying immutable laws, a relentless race to progress in which humanity is sacrificed; the weak die, whether they are masters or workers. Mrs. Thornton expresses the middle-class view of the working class as \"a pack of ungrateful hounds\".\n\n\"North and South\" belongs to the canon of \"condition of England\" novels (also known as social-problem, industrial or social novels) which analyse Victorian social realities, offering \"first-hand detailed observations of industrialism, urbanism, class, and gender conflicts\". It attempts to answer questions posed by contemporary changes positioning itself between the individual worker freedom championed by John Stuart Mill (author of \"The Claims of Labor\", published in the \"Edinburgh Review\" in 1845) and developed by Thornton in Chapter 15 and the responsibility of employers to their employees promoted by John Ruskin and Arthur Helps. It represents a certain paternalism, challenging the cutoff between public and private spheres, freedom and responsibility, workplace and family life, trying to define a balance in relations between employers and workers. Through Margaret and her father, Gaskell criticizes the autocratic model which infantilizes workers and is defended by Thornton (who does not feel accountable to his workers for his actions or decisions). She advocates for an authority which takes into account the needs of workers, a social and economic contract as advocated by John Locke in \"Two Treatises of Government\", where masters and workers are in solidarity. After the strike, Thornton finally acknowledges that \"new forms of negotiation between management and labor are part of modern life\"; the strike, which ruined him, was \"respectable\" because the workers depend on him for money and he depends on them to manufacture his product.\n\nIn the class struggle which victimizes some (such as Boucher and Bessy), Gaskell does not offer definitive conflict resolution: Thornton's hope for strikes, for instance, is that they no longer be \"bitter and venomous\". He and Higgins reach a level of understanding beyond a \"cash nexus\" through Margaret's \"ongoing involvement in the process of social change\" by urging communication between masters and workers. If the holders of economic power agree to talk to their workers, to consider them as human beings (not tools of production), it may not eliminate social conflicts but will reduce their brutality. The protagonists experience personal transformations which unite them in the end, what Stoneman calls a \"balanced emancipation\".\n\nAccording to Catherine Barnes Stevenson, Gaskell may have found women doing factory work problematic; she often referred to \"masters and men\" and used one dying factory worker (Bessy) to represent women workers, who constituted more than half the factory workers at the time. Stevenson wrote that Gaskell's relative silence on female factory workers may reflect her struggle with the \"triumph of the domestic ideology\" by the middle class of the mid-1800s. Gaskell hints at the difficulties families such as the Hales have keeping female domestic workers (like Dixon) in their proper – subordinate – place and becoming like members of the family (blurring class differences), a scenario facing industrial workers as well.\n\nIn the first television adaptation (in 1966), Richard Leech played Mr. Thornton and Wendy Williams played Margaret Hale.\n\nIn the second television adaptation (in 1975), Patrick Stewart played Mr. Thornton and Rosalie Shanks played Margaret Hale. Tim Pigott-Smith, who played Mr. Hale in the 2004 adaptation, played Frederick (his son) in the 1975 version.\n\nIn 2004 the BBC aired \"North & South\", a four-episode serial with Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage in the lead roles. Sandy Welch wrote the screenplay, and Brian Percival directed.\n\nA pastiche, \"Nice Work\" by David Lodge, was published in 1988. A Sunday Express Book of the Year winner, it was adapted as a television series by the BBC in 1989.\n\n\n\n"}

He married in 1947. He attended Centenary College on the G.I. Bill and earned an M.A. in history from Louisiana State University, working with Francis Butler Simkins. He received his Ph.D. in history from Columbia University in New York, working with David Herbert Donald.\n\nMcWhiney's dissertation dealt with Confederate General Braxton Bragg. McWhiney became a noted specialist on the American Civil War era, as well as southern social and economic history. He coauthored \"Attack and Die\" with his doctoral student Perry Jamieson. He published \"Braxton Bragg and Confederate Defeat\", in two volumes, as well as many scholarly and popular articles and reviews. He lectured frequently to both academic and popular audiences.\n\nMcWhiney and Forrest McDonald were the authors of the \"Celtic Thesis,\" which holds that most Southerners were of Celtic ancestry (as opposed to Anglo-Saxon), and that all groups he declared to be \"Celtic\" (Scots-Irish, Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Cornish) were descended from warlike herdsmen, in contrast to the peaceful farmers who predominated in England. They attempted to trace numerous ways in which the Celtic culture shaped social, economic and military behavior. \n\n\"Attack and Die\" stressed the ferocity of the Celtic warrior tradition. In \"Continuity in Celtic Warfare.\" (1981), McWhiney argues that an analysis of Celtic warfare from 225 BC to 1865 demonstrates cultural continuity. The Celts repeatedly took high risks that resulted in lost battles and lost wars. Celts were not self-disciplined, patient, or tenacious. They fought boldly but recklessly in the Battles of Telamon (225 BC), Culloden (1746) and Gettysburg (1863). According to their thesis, the South lost the Civil War because Southerners fought like their Celtic ancestors, who were intensely loyal to their leaders but lacked efficiency, perseverance, and foresight.\n\nIn 1993 he argued the fundamental differences between North and South developed during the 18th century, when Celtic migrants first settled in the Old South. Some of the fundamental attributes that caused the Old South to adopt anti-English values and practices were Celtic social organization, language, and means of livelihood. It was supposedly the Celtic values and traditions that set the agrarian South apart from the industrialized civilization developing in the North.\n\nHowever, McWhiney's theories do not address large-scale Irish immigration to New York, Boston, and other northern cities. They also ignore the degree to which the Southern planter class resembled the English gentry in lineage, religion, and social structure. Furthermore his work avoids mentioning or acknowledging the fact that the largest group of pre-Revolution immigrants to the Southern colonies were English indentured servants who vastly outnumbered the \"Celtic\" settlers both in numbers and in cultural influence.\n\nMcWhiney taught at Troy State University, Millsaps College, the University of California, Berkeley, Northwestern University, the University of British Columbia, Wayne State University, the University of Alabama, Texas Christian University, The University of Southern Mississippi, and McMurry University. Over a 44-year career, he trained 19 history Ph.Ds.\n\nMcWhiney founded the Grady McWhiney Research Foundation, located in Abilene, Texas.\n\nMcWhiney was a former director of the League of the South, but he had broken with the group prior to his death.\n\nAs historian C. David Dalton has pointed out, he was \"Controversial. Unconventional. Influential. These are words easily applied to one of the South's most prominent scholars, Grady McWhiney.

The two friends struggle with adult career and relationship problems, all the while defiantly clinging to the geeky science fiction pop culture of their youth and seeking advice from their greatest hero, William Shatner.\n\nShatner plays a campy caricature of himself as he works on a one-man musical version of \"Julius Caesar\" in hopes of finally being taken seriously as a dramatist and musical performer. Hip-hop artist \"The Rated R\", joined by Shatner, provides the concluding musical number \"No Tears for Caesar\", a pastiche of famous lines from the play set to a rap rhythm. The film's score was produced by Scott Spock.\n\n\nKay Reindl, a friend of Mark A. Altman and Robert Meyer Burnett, and a television writer on \"Millennium\" and \"The Twilight Zone\", felt that they could make a film out of their clique's obsession with \"Star Trek\". Burnett remembered that one day Altman called him and read a scene where he was beaten up in junior high school for wearing a \"Trek\" uniform. William Shatner appeared to him as a vision and told him to fight back. Altman wrote the first draft and then Burnett rewrote it.\n\nWhen Altman and Burnett approached Shatner about being in \"Free Enterprise\" he was not interested: \"I had played my [Kirk] persona as far as I wanted to go and probably as far as anybody wants me to go.\" Undaunted, Altman and Burnett tweaked his character to be more like Peter O'Toole's in \"My Favorite Year\". They also incorporated several anecdotes from Shatner's actual life.\n\n\"Free Enterprise\" had a tiny theatrical release in only nine Los Angeles theaters in 1998 with little promotion. Burnett said, \"Nobody went to see it. It was really disheartening\". In his review for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Kevin Thomas said that the film brought \"new life into the Hollywood-set romantic comedy genre\" and was \"funny, sharp and engaging\". The \"L.A.

Williams was the lead vocalist for R&B/Soul group Tower of Power. As a soloist, Williams made several hit recordings, including 1978's \"Cause I Love You\" and 1977's \"Choosing You\".\n\nWilliams was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and moved to Oakland, California, at a young age. Learning to play the trumpet in elementary school fueled his interest in music; his skills as a vocalist were first nurtured by singing in gospel choirs and groups around the Bay Area. He worked with several notable artists, such as Sly Stone, Andraé Crouch, Billy Preston and members of the Hawkins family, Edwin, Walter and Tramaine.\n\nAfter winning several local talent contests, Williams signed his first recording contract with Fantasy Records. He cut two singles for the label, including \"Lisa's Gone\" and \"Feelin Blue\", written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival. In 1972, Williams joined the emerging funk band Tower of Power. A string of hits followed, including \"So Very Hard to Go\", \"What Is Hip\", \"Don't Change Horses (In The Middle of the Stream)\" and \"Willing To Learn\". During his two years with the group, Williams participated in three albums: \"Back To Oakland\", \"Urban Renewal\" and the gold LP \"Tower of Power\". Williams and Tower of Power toured throughout the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\nWhile still with Tower of Power, he recorded his first solo album \"Pray for the Lion\" for Warner Bros. Records in 1974. At the end of 1975, Williams left the band and returned to his solo projects. Initially signing with Motown Records in 1975, he later moved to ABC Records in 1977 (which was then purchased by MCA Records in 1979). With producer Frank Wilson at the helm and songwriters such as Judy Wieder, Clay Drayton, Terry McFadden, and John Footman, over the next four years, he scored ten chart hits, including \"Shoo Doo FuFu Ooh\", \"Choosing You\", \"You Got Me Running\", \"Love Hurt Me Love Healed Me\", \"Here's to the Lady,\" and \"Midnight Girl\". Williams recorded four more albums from 1977 to 1980: \"Choosing You\", his first gold LP; \"Spark of Love\" (contains the hits \"You Got Me Running\", and \"Cause I Love You\" as well as \"Midnight Girl\"); \"Love Current\"; \"Taking Chances\" and \"Let's Do It Today\".\n\nAfter leaving MCA, Williams recorded for the independent record labels, Rockshire and Knobhill. In 1986, he was invited to sing vocals on \"Don't Make Me Wait For Love\", a track from \"Duotones\", a multi-platinum recording by Kenny G. The song became a Top 20 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and R&B hit the following year.\n\nHis 1978 hit song \"Cause I Love You\" was sampled by Havoc of Mobb Deep for the track \"Nothing Like Home\", and by Kanye West for the songs \"Overnight Celebrity\" by Twista and \"I Got A Love\" by Jin. The track was sampled a fourth time in 2007 by Scarface for his single \"Girl You Know\" featuring Trey Songz & Young Jeezy sampled \"Let's Talk It Over\" for his single \"I Do\" featuring Jay-Z and Andre 3000. His song \"Half Past Love\" was also sampled by The Coup for their 2006 single \"My Favorite Mutiny\" featuring Black Thought of The Roots and Talib Kweli of Black Star.\n\nSince that time, Williams has continued his solo career, touring the US, Europe and South Africa, and has also expanded his career to include acting, starring in several stage plays, including \"Love on Lay Away\" starring Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Martha Wash, \"What Men Don't Tell\" starring Kenny Lattimore, Chante Moore, and Dottie Peoples, and \"When A Woman's Fed Up\". He is also one of the featured artists on Urbanland Music's DVD \"The Big Show\", recorded at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 29, 2002.\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Lenny Williams among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332305", "title": "WJW (TV)", "text": "WJW (TV)\n\nWJW, virtual and VHF digital channel 8, is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Its second digital subchannel serves as an owned-and-operated station of the classic TV network Antenna TV. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WJW's studios are located on Dick Goddard Way (named for the station's longtime weatherman—previously known as South Marginal Road) just northeast of downtown Cleveland near the shore of Lake Erie, and its transmitter is located in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, Ohio.\n\nThe television station first signed on the air on December 19, 1949 as WXEL, originally broadcasting on VHF channel 9. It was founded by the Empire Coil Company, a wartime manufacturer of radio coils and transformers. In its early years, WXEL was a primary DuMont affiliate, and later became a secondary provider of ABC programs, sharing that affiliation with WEWS (channel 5). WXEL also carried a number of CBS programs that WEWS declined to air. Some of the daytime shows originated at Cinecraft Productions on Franklin Boulevard in Ohio City. WXEL also carried an affiliation with the short-lived Paramount Television Network, and in fact was one of that network's strongest affiliates. The station aired such Paramount Network programs as \"Hollywood Wrestling\", \"Bandstand Revue\", and \"Time for Beany\". During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nFollowing the 1952 release of the Federal Communications Commission' s \"Sixth Report and Order\", a realignment of VHF channels in the Midwest forced WXEL to move to channel 8 on December 10, 1953. Its former channel 9 allocation was moved to Steubenville and given to a new station, WSTV-TV (now WTOV); the switch took place only two weeks before WSTV-TV went on the air.\n\nIn 1954, Empire Coil sold two of its television interests—WXEL and KPTV in Portland, Oregon, the United States' first UHF station—to Storer Broadcasting. George B. Storer, the company's founder and president, was a member of the board of directors of CBS, and used his influence to take the CBS television affiliation from WEWS in March 1955. WEWS became an exclusive ABC affiliate (and remains so to this day), while the DuMont network shut down operations in 1955.\n\nStorer changed channel 8's call letters to WJW-TV on April 15, 1956, to complement WJW radio (AM 850, now WKNR, and FM 104.1, now WQAL), respectively. All three stations later moved to the former Esquire Theater building at 1630 Euclid Avenue, near Playhouse Square.\n\nOn November 16, 1963, approximately 30 WJW radio and television personalities went on strike, forcing both stations to use supervisory and production personnel in those roles, many from parent company Storer Broadcasting stations in Atlanta and Miami. The main bargaining point was Storer's attempt to institute a new, drastically reduced fee schedule for performers. On November 20, WJW-TV broadcast a taped panel segment that offered the striking performers the opportunity to state its case, since management had presented its side two nights earlier. After nearly reaching agreement on November 23 before talks collapsed, the two sides finally came to an agreement on November 27.\n\nOn November 2, 1975, the station moved to its present studios at 5800 South Marginal Road, which were built with a more modern approach than Storer's usual exterior studio design; the building features a number of columns framed by windows in the front, though the large front was not of the usual Georgian or Colonial mansion-esque design common with WJW's sister stations. While WJW-FM (104.1 FM, now WQAL) was sold in the late 1960s, Storer kept WJW (850 AM, now WKNR) until late 1976, when the group sold the radio station to Lake Erie Broadcasting. The AM station's new owners were allowed to keep the WJW call letters, forcing channel 8 to change theirs, per a since-repealed FCC rule that prohibited radio and television stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same base call letters. As a result, channel 8 changed its callsign to WJKW-TV on April 22, 1977. (The added \"K\" did not stand for anything.)\n\nOn September 16, 1985, the station reacquired the WJW-TV callsign (eventually shortened to simply WJW), as had changed its callsign following the radio station's own transfer of ownership to Booth American Broadcasting (the aforementioned call letter rule was still in effect then). After Storer Broadcasting was bought out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1985, the station underwent a series of ownership changes. KKR sold the stations to Gillett Communications in 1987; shortly thereafter, SCI Television was spun off from Gillett to take over the stations after Gillett's bankruptcy.\n\nOn February 17, 1993, one day after SCI purchased WTVT in Tampa from Gillett Holdings in a separate agreement for $163 million, New World Pictures purchased a 51% ownership stake in SCI Television from Gillett for $100 million and $63 million in newly issued debt; the film and television production company folded WJW and its six sister stations—fellow CBS affiliates WTVT, WAGA-TV in Atlanta, WJBK-TV in Detroit and WITI-TV in Milwaukee, NBC affiliate KNSD in San Diego and independent station WSBK-TV in Boston—into a new broadcasting subsidiary, New World Communications.\n\nOn May 23, 1994, as part of an overall deal in which network parent News Corporation also purchased a 20% equity interest in the group, New World signed a long-term affiliation agreement with Fox to switch 13 television stations that it owned or was acquiring from one of the three major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC and NBC) to Fox once their existing affiliation contracts expired. The deal was motivated by the National Football League (NFL)'s awarding of the rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) television package to Fox on December 18, 1993, in which the conference's broadcast television rights moved to the network effective with the 1994 NFL season, ending a 38-year relationship with CBS.\n\nAt the time the agreement was signed, the affiliation contract of WJW-TV was set to expire on or shortly after September 1, 1994, giving CBS only five months to land another Cleveland affiliate. The agreement with New World concerned CBS executives, as New World planned to switch several of the network's stronger-performing affiliates in other markets to Fox, a move that often forced CBS to affiliate with either a former Fox affiliate or a lower-profile independent station. To prevent such a situation from happening in Cleveland, CBS approached Scripps-Howard Broadcasting in an attempt to sign its WEWS as the network's new Cleveland affiliate.\n\nOn June 16, however, Scripps-Howard signed a long-term deal with ABC that would keep WEWS as its Cleveland outlet. CBS would reach an agreement with Malrite Communications to move its programming to Fox charter affiliate WOIO (channel 19). WJW switched to Fox on September 3, 1994, becoming the first New World station to switch to the network under the agreement; WOIO concurrently switched to CBS.\n\nOn July 17, 1996, News Corporation announced that it would acquire New World in an all-stock transaction worth $2.48 billion, bringing its ten Fox affiliates under network ownership. Under Fox ownership, WJW added stronger first-run syndicated shows as well as stronger off-network sitcoms to the programming mix. It was the only fully network owned-and-operated station among the \"Big Four\" network outlets in the Cleveland area, and was the only Fox-owned station to carry a historic 1920s three-letter call sign. It remains the only Fox television affiliate to utilize a three-letter call sign.\n\nOn December 22, 2007, Fox sold WJW-TV and seven other owned-and-operated stations to Local TV for $1.1 billion; the sale was finalized on July 14, 2008. On July 1, 2013, the Tribune Company acquired the Local TV stations for $2.75 billion; the sale was completed on December 27.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Under its original structure, the deal – following regulatory approval by the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division – would have given Sinclair ownership or operational management of television stations in six of Ohio's nine television markets, with Lima and Zanesville (both markets with only one news operation) and Youngstown (locked up by Nexstar Media Group and the locally based Maag family) becoming the only remaining markets in the state where it does not have a presence (Sinclair already owns ABC affiliates WSYX in Columbus and WKEF in Dayton, NBC affiliates WTOV-TV in Steubenville and WNWO-TV in Toledo, and the Cincinnati duopoly of CBS affiliate WKRC-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WSTR-TV; through shared services agreements, it also operates Fox affiliate WTTE and CW affiliate WWHO in Columbus, and Fox affiliate WRGT-TV in Dayton).\n\nOn April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that WJW would be one of 23 stations sold to obtain approval for the merger, though it was one of seven stations for which a buyer was not disclosed. On May 9, 2018, it was officially announced that Fox Television Stations would buy back WJW, as part of a $910-million deal that also involved six other Tribune-owned stations (Fox affiliates KTXL in Sacramento, KSWB-TV in San Diego, KDVR in Denver, KSTU in Salt Lake City and KCPQ in Seattle, and CW affiliate WSFL-TV in Miami). With eight different owners since 1985, the deal would result in WJW having had the most successive owners of any television station in the Cleveland market.\n\nThree weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The termination of the Sinclair sale agreement places uncertainty for the future of Fox's purchases of WJW and the other six Tribune stations included in that deal, which were predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger. Sinclair ultimately entered Cleveland via its acquisition of Fox Sports Networks, bringing Fox Sports Ohio and SportsTime Ohio under the Sinclair umbrella.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal—which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019—would put WJW under common ownership with Nexstar's existing properties elsewhere in Ohio (NBC affiliate WCMH-TV in Columbus, NBC affiliate WDTN and CW-affiliated SSA partner WBDT in Dayton and CBS affiliate WKBN-TV, Fox affiliate WYFX-LD and ABC-affiliated SSA partner WYTV in Youngstown; this also includes CBS affiliates in Wheeling, West Virginia (WTRF-TV) and Huntington, West Virginia (WOWK-TV) that cover Southeastern Ohio); additionally, it would also make WJW sister stations with adjacent-market ABC affiliate WJET-TV and Fox-affiliated LMA partner WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania. However, reports preceding the purchase announcement stated that, as it did during the group's failed purchase by Sinclair, Fox Television Stations may seek to acquire certain Fox-affiliated stations owned by Tribune—with WJW potentially being a candidate for resale—from the eventual buyer of that group. It was later reported that, as part of Fox's affiliation renewal with Nexstar-owned stations, it was indeed looking at reacquiring WJW alongside KDVR and KCPQ from the previous Sinclair-Tribune-Fox deal, with the remaining stations either remaining with Nexstar (KTXL and KSWB-TV) or being sold to WEWS parent E. W. Scripps Company (KSTU and WSFL-TV); WKYC parent Tegna Inc. is also buying stations from Nexstar. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019. After the sale closed, it was reported that Fox had decided against reacquiring WJW, keeping the station with Nexstar permanently.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWJW shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 31 to VHF channel 8.\n\nThe former temporary channel 31 transmitter has remained in a functional, though dormant state since the transition; Tribune Broadcasting donated the transmitter to the National Association of Broadcasters, which it used to conduct a six-month test of the \"Futurecast\" ATSC 3.0 standard advanced by LG Electronics and GatesAir beginning in May 2015, as WI9X3Y. The transmitter remained active for the duration of the 2016 World Series (which the Indians played in), broadcasting in 4K UHD to the Cleveland area using the ATSC 3.0 standard with Dolby AC-4 Audio (though the audio standard has not been completely finalized yet, with AC-4 and competitor MPEG-H as the remaining options for audio). This station also broadcasts brief, intermittent ATSC 1.0-compatible signals during parts of the day for reception comparisons under the callsign of WI9XJY.\n\nIn addition to the Fox network schedule, syndicated programs broadcast on WJW include \"Judge Judy\", \"Daily Mail TV\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"The Real\" and \"The Dr. Oz Show\".\n\nSince it joined the network in September 1994, channel 8 has only aired Fox's prime time, late night, news and sports programming, with the only content it has aired involving Fox's children's programming having been of fall preview specials and network promotions for those blocks that aired within the network's prime time lineup for the final twelve years that Fox carried programming aimed at that demographic. The only notable program preemption outside of the network's children's blocks has been that of the secondary Sunday morning NFL pre-game show \"Fox NFL Kickoff\", of which WJW has declined carriage on the station's main channel since the program moved to Fox from Fox Sports 1 in September 2015; WJW instead airs a half-hour extension of its Sunday morning newscast and paid real estate programming in the program's network-recommended time slot, deferring \"Fox NFL Kickoff\" to the station's second digital subchannel.\n\nLike most of its sister stations, channel 8 preempted portions of the CBS schedule, usually the late morning daytime shows. In the 1990s, WJW-TV and its fellow New World stations prepared to launch their own morning newscasts, and as a result, channel 8 began to preempt \"CBS This Morning\" as well. The station also gained notoriety in September 1993 by being one of the few CBS affiliates that chose to air the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on a half-hour tape delay, in favor of airing \"Murphy Brown\" reruns immediately following its 11:00 p.m. newscast. Despite the preemptions, CBS was generally satisfied with WJW, which was one of the network's strongest affiliates.\n\nAs with most of its sister stations under its former New World ownership (with the subverted exception of St. Louis sister station KTVI), WJW has always declined carriage of Fox's children's programming; it opted not to run the Fox Kids weekday and Saturday blocks when it affiliated with the network, airing children's programs acquired via syndication on Saturday mornings instead (the pre-emptions of Fox Kids by the New World stations led the network to change its carriage policies to allow Fox stations uninterested in carrying the block the right of first refusal to transfer the local rights to another station, restructuring Fox Kids as a network-syndicated program package; by 2001, affiliates were no longer required to run the Fox Kids lineup even if Fox had not secured a substitute carrier). WBNX-TV (channel 55, now an independent station) carried Fox Kids – along with its successor blocks FoxBox and 4Kids TV – from the September 1994 switch until Fox ceased supplying children's programming within the network's schedule on December 28, 2008. On September 13, 2014, WJW began carrying \"Xploration Station\", a live-action educational program block distributed by Steve Rotfeld Productions that is syndicated primarily to Fox stations, on Saturday mornings through an agreement involving Tribune's Fox-affiliated stations.\n\nIn its early years, the station lagged behind its competitors in producing local programming, perhaps because its studio was located at the transmitter in Parma, while the other stations had studios downtown. A young Alan Freed, previously at WAKR radio in Akron, worked for WXEL starting in 1949. Freed hosted an afternoon movie and performed live commercials for several years before he became the self-titled \"father of \"rock and roll\"\" while as an evening host on WJW radio, before moving on to radio jobs in New York City. Soupy Sales, then known as Soupy Hines, had a weekday variety program called \"Soup's On\" where he started his pie-in-the-face routines. In 1961, WJW-TV became the broadcast rights holder of the Cleveland Indians. Channel 8's partnership with the team continued through 1979, when the Indians moved to then-independent station WUAB (channel 43). WJW also carried Indians games that were part of the CBS, and later, Fox network packages of Major League Baseball games.\n\nOne of the most memorable programs produced by WJW-TV was the Friday late night horror movie hosted by \"Ghoulardi\", a character created by Ernie Anderson. Wearing a bad fright wig and phony beard and a pair of sunglasses with only one lens, he interacted with the movies and created an ongoing patter and rehearsed skits during the movie breaks. The program began on January 11, 1963 as \"Shock Theater\" and created a generation of fans who could recite catch phrases such as \"Turn Blue\", \"Stay Sick\", \"Camera Four\" and \"Ova Dey.\" Before Ghoulardi, Anderson had a weekday morning program on channel 8 starting in 1961 called \"Ernie's Place\" with sidekick Tim Conway (then credited as \"Tom Conway\"), that included live skits reminiscent of Bob and Ray.\n\nWhen Anderson left for lucrative voice-over work in Hollywood in September 1966, the Friday night movie slot was succeeded by \"The Hoolihan and Big Chuck Show\"—cohosted by Bob \"Hoolihan\" Wells, who did the station weather forecasts as \"Hoolihan the Weatherman\"; and Charles \"Big Chuck\" Schodowski, a station engineer who had risen to director and had appeared in some of Ghoulardi's skits. After Bob Wells departed channel 8 in September 1979, his position was filled by local jeweler and little person \"Lil' John\" Rinaldi, who had also previously performed in skits on the show. The program was renamed \"The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show\", and it continued airing on Friday nights before moving to Saturday nights in the early 1990s. The show ended its run on June 16, 2007, as Chuck Schodowski retired after a 47-year career at channel 8. At the time of its conclusion, \"The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show\" had been the only locally produced television show in the Cleveland market that was primarily entertainment, that is not news or informational (Big Chuck and Lil' John made a comeback of sorts when they began hosting a new half-hour, weekly program featuring their classic skits that WJW premiered on September 10, 2011).\n\nWJW-TV has long history of broadcasting Cleveland sports teams, whether it is produced in-house or broadcast through CBS or Fox.\n\nChannel 8 was one of two stations involved in the deal between Fox and New World which was located in a market served by an NFL franchise that is not a member of the National Football Conference (NFC); the Cleveland Browns—whose games had occasionally aired on the station dating back to its tenure with CBS—are part of the American Football Conference (AFC), which at the time of the switch, had most of their over-the-air game telecasts carried on WKYC-TV by way of NBC's broadcast rights to the AFC (WDAF-TV, located in the home market of the AFC's Kansas City Chiefs, was the only other New World station in a non-NFC market that switched to Fox). Channel 8 first broadcast Browns games in 1956, when CBS (which WJW-TV was affiliated with then), gained the TV broadcast rights to the pre-merger NFL; all Browns games would exclusively on channel 8 until 1969. Since 1970 (with the completion of the AFL/NFL merger, and the Browns' subsequent move to the newly-formed AFC, and with exception of the team's three-year operational hiatus that began in 1996), channel 8 has carried at least two Browns games per year, usually consisting of interconference games in which the team plays host to an NFC team at FirstEnergy Stadium; in addition, with the institution of the league's \"cross-flex\" broadcast rules in 2014, any games that are arbitrarily moved from WOIO will be shown on WJW if Fox acquires the regional telecasting rights.\n\nChannel 8 was also the home station for the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers from 1976 to 1980; it also aired Cavaliers games aired via CBS' NBA broadcast contract from 1973 to 1990.\n\nIn addition, the station has aired Cleveland Indians games via CBS' MLB coverage from 1990 to 1993, and since 1996, through Fox's broadcast rights.\n\nWJW presently broadcasts 68 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11½ hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 5½ hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the largest local newscast output among any station in the state of Ohio, and one of the highest weekly newscast totals of any television station in the United States.\n\nDuring its early years of operation, channel 8 broadcast a popular and unique 11:00 p.m. newscast, \"The Sohio Reporter\", featuring a Western Reserve University speech professor named Warren Guthrie who delivered the entire newscast from memory, speaking directly into the camera long before the days of the teleprompter. In September 1963, WJW-TV was one of the first stations to employ a two-man news anchor team, Joel Daly and Doug Adair, in the studio together. The station retitled its evening newscasts as \"City Camera News\", in a format which had reporters equipped with Polaroid cameras to photograph news events, so that pictures could be quickly broadcast when they returned to the studio. Station programming also featured \"Adventure Road\", hosted by Jim Doney, which presented filmed travelogues narrated by the filmmakers.\n\nDick Goddard came to channel 8 as its chief weatherman in 1966, following a prior five-year tenure at WKYC-TV (Goddard went along with nearly all of Westinghouse's former Cleveland staffers following a reversal of a 1956 station swap with NBC that saw Westinghouse Broadcasting reacquire WRCV-TV in Philadelphia and move the KYW-TV calls there, but returned to Cleveland after only a few months). Goddard said that the incentive for joining WJW-TV was the fact that CBS carried Cleveland Browns games through its contract with the National Football League (the rights to which were ironically lost to WKYC in 1970 upon the team's move to the AFC). Goddard later became the team's statistician, a position he held until 2011. Goddard—who was honored for his 50 years of broadcasting in the Cleveland market, with the renaming of the stretch of South Marginal Road that runs in front of the WJW studios as \"Dick Goddard Way\" in May 2011—remained with WJW until his retirement on November 22, 2016.\n\nDaly and Adair reigned as Cleveland's top news team until June 1967, when Daly was hired away by ABC-owned WBKB (now WLS-TV) in Chicago. Adair remained at channel 8 through July 1970, when he joined WKYC, which was then owned by NBC. Later in 1964, WJW-TV was the first full CBS affiliate in Ohio, and the first Cleveland TV station, to start local color broadcasts. Following Daly's departure, Martin Ross became Adair's on-air news partner for the next three years, then teamed with Murray Stewart when Adair left. The duo worked together until Ross's death from cancer in April 1973. Jeff Maynor had filled in when Ross was undergoing treatment, and continued in that role for the next four months until Jim Hale teamed with Stewart beginning on September 11, 1973. Just over a year later, Stewart asked to be taken off the broadcast, citing health problems, and was later reassigned to the noon news, with Maynor taking his place on the nightly broadcast. Stewart committed suicide on August 3, 1976, overdosing on Nembutal in a suburban Cleveland motel.\n\nShortly after the callsign change to WJKW, the station hired former WKYC-TV and NBC Radio news anchor Virgil Dominic as its news and public affairs director (a position which he held until 1983 when he became the general manager for WJKW/WJW until his retirement in 1995), and also began to pump considerable money into its news operation. The name of the newscasts even underwent a transition as well, going from \"City Camera News\" to \"Newscenter 8\" around the summer of 1977. Within a year, channel 8 had overtaken longtime leader WEWS as the highest-rated news station in Cleveland – a lead it kept for almost 20 years. Tim Taylor joined WJW-TV as consumer reporter in the summer of 1977, having been hired away from WEWS, where he held a similar role. The following year, Taylor became Judd Hambrick's partner on the station's 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. weeknight newscasts. For much of Taylor's 27-year run as an anchor at WJW (the second longest in Cleveland television history, behind Ted Henry, who worked at WEWS for 37 years from 1972 to 2009), he served alongside several female anchors (including Tana Carli, Denise D'Ascenzo, Robin Swoboda, Denise Dufala and Wilma Smith). Taylor retired from broadcasting on December 23, 2005, after which he was replaced by fellow longtime Cleveland TV newsman Lou Maglio; one month prior, Taylor and Goddard were reunited with Swoboda and former sports anchor Casey Coleman in a special segment during \"Fox 8 News in the Morning\". The foursome has been quoted as one of \"Cleveland's most successful news teams\" during the 1980s, and helped lead \"Newscenter 8\" to number one in the Cleveland market during that decade.\n\nIn 1991, WJW implemented the \"24-Hour News Source\" concept that was originally developed the year prior by rival WEWS, positioning itself as \"Cleveland's Own 24 Hour Newsroom\". At that time, the station began producing news updates of 30 seconds in length during local commercial break inserts within syndicated and CBS network programs at or near the top of each hour in time periods when the station was not carrying regularly scheduled, long-form newscasts or the half-hourly updates it aired during \"CBS This Morning\". After WJW became a Fox affiliate on September 3, 1994, the station underwent a major shift in its programming philosophy that more heavily emphasized its local news programming. The station initially expanded its news production to over 40 hours a week, and through the years continued expanding, eventually reaching 65½ hours per week by 2015.\n\nIn October 1995, WJW retired the \"\"Newscenter 8\"\" branding and the \"24-Hour News Source\" concept, and adopted a hard-hitting format that saw the implementation of the phrase \"\"eiht is News\"\" as the title of its newscasts (the \"\"eiht\"\" logo was itself based on a logo used by WJW from 1966 to 1977 that was first used to herald the station's switch to color broadcasts). Consequently, the station used \"\"Fox is eiht\"\" as a generalized branding to promote the station's non-news programming, in particular, those offered through its new Fox affiliation (thereby, becoming one of the first New World outlets to fully include network references in its branding). This accompanied a change in format for harder-edged news; viewers did not respond positively to either the format changes, or the constant branding reinforcement (to the point that a story in the \"Cleveland Plain Dealer\" began with the lede \"WJW Channel 8's constant repetition of its ubiquitous 'EI8HT Is News' slogan has some viewers squawking that Eight Is Enough, Already\" ). They instead turned to the more traditional WEWS; WKYC was likewise busy trying to find an audience after years of being used as NBC's 'farm' station. The \"\"eiht is News\"\" branding ended upon Fox's purchase of the station, after which it was replaced by \"\"Fox 8 News\"\", which remains in use to this day as the station's news branding.\n\nOne triumph for WJW was its weekday morning newscast, as, without a national morning news program supplied by Fox, WJW could produce an all-local, 3½-hour-long program to fill part of the time period. Many Cleveland viewers preferred the local show over the national broadcasts aired on WKYC, WEWS and WOIO. This was especially true since WEWS' long-running local show \"The Morning Exchange\" was moved to 9:00 a.m. around the time of the Fox/CBS switch. With the exception of a brief period from late 1994 through late 1995 when it was titled \"Good Day Cleveland\", \"Fox 8 News in the Morning\" has constantly been Cleveland's top rated morning newscast since the time of its debut. Another advantage of the affiliation switch was the shift of the late newscast from 11:00 p.m. to 10:00, which also resulted in the program's expansion into a one-hour-long broadcast; with conversion of the news department launched six years earlier by WUAB to serve as a joint operation with newly minted CBS outlet WOIO and the balancing act of managing both stations, along with the unproven lead-in of WUAB's new UPN and WB network programming, WJW quickly overtook WUAB's longer-established prime time newscast at 10:00 p.m. without much issue.\n\nIn news programming, the station retook the top position from WEWS in 2001. By mid-2002, all of WJW's newscasts placed first. This continued until January 2004, when viewers began turning away from WJW's hard-hitting style to the more traditional WKYC-TV. Even \"Fox 8 in the Morning\" lost its top spot to WKYC's morning newscast for about two months. As a result of the overall decline, WJW replaced longtime 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. lead anchors Wilma Smith and Tim Taylor, with Bill Martin and Stacey Bell at 10:00 p.m., hoping the two would attract a younger audience to the program. The change paid off for channel 8, and today its newscasts frequently rank number-one in the ratings.\n\n\n\n"}

At its peak population in the late 1970s, the region had a population of just over 22,000. A reduction in iron mining operations in the late 20th century caused a major decline in jobs and population.\n\nAs of 2011, Wabush's population was 1,861. Most residents continue to work in the nearby mine: Iron Ore Company of Canada, now a unit of Rio Tinto Mines.\n\nCompanies in and around Wabush include:\n\n\nWhile remote, the town contains modern amenities. A shopping centre includes a post office, bank, a restaurant, a bar, and a snowmobile store. There is also a recreational centre, which includes a bowling alley, gymnasium, swimming pool, a teen centre, and a weight lifting room; an ice arena, a library, a legion building that serves alcoholic beverages, a furniture store, several playgrounds, a school, a church, two corner stores, a hotel (which also includes a restaurant, a barber shop, and a bar). Nearby Labrador City has a modern indoor shopping centre, which includes a Walmart, Mark's Work Wearhouse and Canadian Tire.\n\nIn 2017, MHA Graham Letto and Labrador City Mayor Wayne Button stated that the municipal governments of Labrador City and Wabush are looking into the idea of amalgamation.\n\nAir transportation needs for the twin communities are served by Wabush Airport and seasonally by Wabush Water Aerodrome. It used to receive more frequent service by Air Gaspé, which was acquired by Quebecair in 1973.

Currently the area is serviced by Air Canada (Air Canada Express & Exploits Valley Air Services), Provincial Airlines, Pascan Air and Air Inuit.\n\nLike most of Labrador, Wabush has a subarctic climate (Köppen \"Dfc\") with precipitation much higher than usual for this type of climate due to the persistent Icelandic Low, which give the region some of the rainiest and snowiest weather in all of Canada. Especially in summer, cloudiness is very high due to the lakes nearby and the unstable northerly airstreams that prevail, but because the town is relatively far from the open sea, sunshine is higher than even in St. John's due to the absence of fog from the Labrador Current. Snow usually melts off in May.\n\n\nWabush appears in the John Wyndham post-catastrophe novel \"The Chrysalids\" under the name of Waknuk.\n\n"}

{"id": "2332327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332327", "title": "Gastrointestinal cancer", "text": "Gastrointestinal cancer\n\nGastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.\n\nOverall, the GI tract and the accessory organs of digestion (pancreas, liver, gall bladder) are responsible for more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other system in the body. There is significant geographic variation in the rates of different gastrointestinal cancers.\n\nEsophageal cancer is the sixth-most-common cancer in the world, and its incidence is increasing. Some three to five males are affected for each female. An \"esophageal cancer belt\", in which the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is more than a hundred times that of adjacent areas, extends from northeastern China through central Asia to northern Iran. Ethiopia also has a notably high incidence. There are two main types of esophageal cancer—adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Worldwide, the incidence of each type is about the same, but in developed countries like North America and Europe adenocarcinoma is the more common.\n\nCancer of the esophagus is often detected late inasmuch as there are typically no early symptoms. Nevertheless, if the cancer is caught soon enough, patients can have a five-year survival rate of 90% or above. By the time esophageal cancer is usually detected, though, it might have spread beyond the esophageal wall, and the survival rate drops significantly. In China, the overall five-year survival rate for advanced esophageal cancer is about 20%, and in the United States it is about 15%.\n\nCancer of the stomach, also called gastric cancer, is the fourth-most-common type of cancer and the second-highest cause of cancer death globally. Eastern Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia) is a high-risk area for gastric cancer, and North America, Australia, New Zealand and western and northern Africa are areas with low risk. The most common type of gastric cancer is adenocarcinoma, which causes about 750,000 deaths each year. Important factors that may contribute to the development of gastric cancer include diet, smoking and alcohol consumption, genetic aspects (including a number of heritable syndromes) and infections (for example, \"Helicobacter pylori\" or Epstein-Barr virus) and pernicious anemia. Chemotherapy improves survival compared to best supportive care, however the optimal regimen is unclear.\n\nPancreatic cancer is the fifth-most-common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and the seventh most common in Europe. In 2008, globally there were 280,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer reported and 265,000 deaths. These cancers are classified as endocrine or nonendocrine tumors. The most common is ductal adenocarcinoma. The most significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer are advanced age (over 60) and smoking. Chronic pancreatitis, diabetes or other conditions may also be involved in their development. Early pancreatic cancer does not tend to result in any symptom, but when a tumor is advanced, a patient may experience severe pain in the upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back. Another symptom might be jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes.\n\nPancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5%. By the time the cancer is diagnosed, it is usually at an advanced, inoperable stage. Only one in about fifteen to twenty patients is curative surgery attempted. Pancreatic cancer tends to be aggressive, and it resists radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\nPeople get liver cancer (also called \"hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC\" or \"hepatoma)\" typically from a prolonged Hepatitis B or C infection or as a result of cirrhosis from chronic alcoholism. Liver cancer may bring about yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), itching (pruritus), or cause a buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites). A person may feel an enlarging mass, or the cancer might be revealed by abnormal liver function tests.\n\nAn attending practitioner might order a biopsy, an MRI or a CT scan, and a patient might be monitored through blood tests (including alpha-fetoprotein, liver-function tests or ultrasound. These cancers are typically treated according to their TNM stage and whether or not cirrhosis is present. Options include surgical resection, embolisation, ablation or a liver transplant.\n\nCancers of the gallbladder are typically adenocarcinomas, and are common in elderly women. Gallbladder cancer is strongly associated with gallstones, a porcelain gallbladder appearance on ultrasound, and the presence of polyps within the gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer may manifest with weight loss, jaundice, and pain in the upper right of. It is typically diagnosed with ultrasound and staged with CT. The prognosis for gallbladder cancer is poor.\n\n\nColorectal cancer is a disease of old age: It typically originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it is often associated with hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.\n\nUse of a colonoscope can find these cancers, and a biopsy can reveal the extent of the involvement of the bowel wall. Removal of a section of the colon is necessary for treatment, with or without chemotherapy. Colorectal cancer has a comparatively good prognosis when detected early.\n\nAn important anatomic landmark in anal cancer is the pectinate line (dentate line), which is located about 1–2 cm from the anal verge (where the anal mucosa of the anal canal becomes skin). Anal cancers located above this line (towards the head) are more likely to be carcinomas, whilst those located below (towards the feet) are more likely to be squamous cell carcinomas that may ulcerate. Anal cancer is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and the sexually transmissible infections HPV and HIV. Anal cancer may be a cause of constipation or tenesmus, or may be felt as a palpable mass, although it may occasionally present as an ulcerative form.\n\nAnal cancer is investigated by biopsy and may be treated by excision and radiotherapy, or with external beam radiotherapy and adjunctive chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate with the latter procedure is above 70%.\n\nA gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor is a rare, slow-growing form of cancer that affects certain cells in the lining of the stomach and intestines. The cells it affects make hormones that regulate the production of digestive juices and muscles that move food through the stomach and intestines. This kind of cancer usually occurs in the appendix, small intestine, or rectum. Its presence is associated with an increased risk of cancers affecting the other parts of the digestive system. It is usually treated with surgery.\n\nA ‘‘field defect’’ or ‘‘field cancerization’’ is a region of tissue that precedes and predisposes to the development of cancer. Field defects occur in progression to gastrointestinal tract cancers. These field defects may contain visible gross manifestations, epigenetic alterations and/or mutations.\n\nAdenocarcinomas of the esophagus tend to arise in a field defect called Barrett's esophagus, a red patch of tissue in the generally pink lower esophagus. A diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus is confirmed by a metaplastic change of the esophageal mucosa from squamous to columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. Barrett's esophagus is the dominant pre-malignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and has prevalent epigenetic alterations.\n\nEsophageal squamous-cell carcinomas may occur as second primary tumors associated with head and neck cancer, due to field cancerization (i.e. a regional reaction to long-term carcinogenic exposure). A field defect associated with progression towards squamous cell carcinoma can be identified with epigenetic markers.\n\nGastric cancer develops within areas (field defects) of the stomach with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia: these lesions represent the cancerization field in which (intestinal-type) gastric cancers develop. In one study, the field defect was clearly demonstrated in gastric carcinogenesis using miRNA high throughput data from normal gastric mucosa (from patients who had never had a gastric malignant neoplasm), non-tumor tissue adjacent to a gastric cancer, and gastric cancer tissue. Greater than 5-fold reductions were found in four miRNAs in tumor-adjacent tissues and gastric cancers as compared to those miRNA levels in normal gastric tissues.\n\nWhen a segment of the large intestine, containing a cancer, is removed, the area adjacent to the cancer (and removed with it) may show additional neoplasia in the form of polyps (see image). This is visual evidence of a field defect. Some of these polyps may be premalignant neoplastic tumors. As shown by Hofstad et al., when polyps are allowed to remain in the colon and are observed for three years, about 40% of polyps are seen to grow larger, likely progressing towards cancer. Luo et al. summarized the substantial body of evidence that field cancerization occurs in the colon, often due to aberrant DNA methylation.\n\n"}

Beginning as a housewright, he evolved into an architect whose work transitioned from Federal style architecture to the later Greek Revival. Parris taught Ammi B. Young, and was among the group of architects influential in founding what would become the American Institute of Architects. He is also responsible for the designs of many lighthouses along the coastal Northeastern United States.\n\nParris was born in Halifax, Massachusetts. At the age of 16, he apprenticed to a housewright in Pembroke, but talent led him towards architecture. Married to Silvina Bonney Stetson in 1800, he moved to Portland, Maine, which was then experiencing a building boom. The city had been bombarded during the Revolution by the Royal Navy, reducing three-quarters to ashes in 1775. But following the war, its trade recovered, almost challenging Boston as the busiest port in New England. Parris received numerous residential and commercial commissions, working in the fashionable style of architect Charles Bulfinch. Like most housewrights of the era, he often used elements derived directly from English architectural books, or those published in the United States by Asher Benjamin. Unfortunately, some of his designs were lost in the Great Fire of 1866, but early photographs and Parris' surviving drawings bespeak works of neoclassical artistry and taste.\nThe boom would end, however, with Jefferson's Embargo of 1807, which lasted 14 months and devastated Portland's mercantile base. Merchants went bankrupt. The Portland Bank, its building designed by Parris, failed. By 1809, construction in the city had come to a halt. Parris left for Richmond, Virginia, where he designed the Wickham House and the Executive Mansion. But architect Benjamin Latrobe examined Parris' preliminary plans for the Wickham House, which resembled his previous Federal style works in Portland, and gave it a blistering review. Latrobe's advice left a profound imprint on the future work of Parris, beginning with the building's revised design. Consequently, the Wickham House is considered a watershed design by Parris, marking the shift from his earlier Adamesque period towards his later, more severe, monumental and architectonic period. In the War of 1812, he served in Plattsburgh, New York as a Captain of the Artificers (engineers), gaining knowledge of military requirements for engineering.\n\nIn 1815, he moved to Boston, where he found a position in the office of Charles Bulfinch. Like his famous employer, Parris produced refined residences, churches and commercial buildings. When in 1817 Bulfinch was called to Washington to work on the U.S. Capitol Building, Parris helped complete the Bulfinch Building home of the Ether Dome at Massachusetts General Hospital. With Bulfinch's departure, Parris soon became the city's leading architect, and a proponent of what would be called \"Boston Granite Style,\" with austere, monolithic stonework. Around 1818-1823 he kept an office on Court Street. He belonged to the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association.\n\nIn 1824, however, he began a twenty-year association working for the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown. He would end his career as chief engineer at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. With the federal government as patron, Parris produced plans for numerous utilitarian structures, from storehouses to ropewalks, and was superintendent of construction at one of the nation's first drydocks, located at the Charlestown base. Today, he is fondly remembered for his stalwart stone lighthouses, commissioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. They are often of a tapered form termed \"windswept.\"\n\nParris balanced the delicacy of his \"superb draftsmanship,\" as it was called, with the coarseness of his building material of choice: granite. His most famous building, Quincy Market, is made of it. Parris died in Pembroke, where he is interred in the Briggs Burying Ground.\n\n\n\n"}

The court consists of nine justices nominated by a state commission and appointed by the governor.\n\nMembers of the court are required to be nonpartisan and are prohibited from a number of political activities including campaign contributions.\n\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court was created by the ratification of the Oklahoma Constitution in 1907.\n\nAfter the construction on the Oklahoma State Capitol, which was completed in 1917, the Oklahoma Supreme Court offices and chamber were housed in the building. Plans to move the offices began in 2006. In 2011, the Oklahoma Supreme Court moved its offices from the Oklahoma State Capitol to the Oklahoma Judicial Center.\n\nThe court consists of a chief justice, a vice-chief justice, and seven associate justices, who are nominated by the Oklahoma Judicial Nominating Commission and are appointed by the governor. After appointment, the justices serve until the next general state election. At that time, they must face a retention election. If retained, they begin a six-year term. After their first term, justices must file for direct election by the people of Oklahoma to retain their position.\n\nThe Oklahoma Constitution specifies the size of the Oklahoma Supreme Court; however, it also grants the state legislature the power to change the number of justices by statute. According to Article VII, section 2, of the Oklahoma Constitution, the court shall consist of nine justices, one justice from each of the nine judicial districts of the state.\n\nEach justice, at the time of his or her election or appointment, must be at least thirty years old, a registered voter in the Supreme Court judicial district they represent for at least one year before filing for the position and a licensed practicing attorney or judge (or both) in Oklahoma for five years before appointment. The potential justice must maintain certification as an attorney or judge during his or her tenure in office in order to main their position.\n\nQualified nominees must submit their names to the Oklahoma Judicial Nominating Commission to verify that they will serve if appointed. In the event of a vacancy on the court, after reviewing potential justices, the commission must submit three names to the governor, of whom the governor appoints one to the Supreme Court to serve until the next general state election. If the governor fails to appoint a justice within sixty days, the chief justice may appoint one of the nominees, who must certify their appointment to Secretary of State of Oklahoma.\n\nEach time a justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court is elected to retain his or her position in the general state elections, he or she continues to serve for another six years in office with a term beginning on the second Monday in January following the general election. Justices appointed to fill vacancies take office immediately and continue to serve in their appointed posts until the next general election. To be eligible to stand for reelection, justices must, within sixty days before the general election, submit their desire to stand for reelection to the Secretary of State.\n\nThe justice is then put to election by the people of Oklahoma. If the majority votes to maintain the justice, the justice will serve for another six-year term. However, if the justice declines reelection or the voters vote the justice down, the seat on the Supreme Court shall be considered vacant at the end of the current term and the Judicial Nominating Commission must search for a potential replacement. Justices who have failed to file for reelection or were not retained by the people in the general election are not eligible to immediately succeed themselves.\n\nRetention in office may be sought for successive terms without limit as to number of years or terms served in office.\n\nSection 4 of Article VII of the Oklahoma Constitution outlines the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is co-extensive with that of the state's borders. The court's jurisdiction applies to all cases \"at law and in equity,\" except criminal cases, in which the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction. If there is a conflict in determining which court has jurisdiction, the Oklahoma Supreme Court is granted the power to determine which court has jurisdiction, with no appeal from the court’s determination.\n\nAlong with Texas, Oklahoma is one of two states to have two courts of last resort; the Oklahoma Supreme Court decides only civil cases, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals decides criminal cases. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has only immediate jurisdiction with respect to new first-impression issues, important legal issues, and cases of great public interest. In addition to appeals from the trial courts, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all lower courts, excluding the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary, and the Oklahoma Senate, when that body is sitting as a Court of Impeachment. Judgments of the Oklahoma Supreme Court with respect to the Oklahoma Constitution are considered final.\n\nThe court's authority includes the power to temporarily reassign judges. The Oklahoma Supreme Court also maintains the power to appoint an administrative director and staff. The director serves at the pleasure of the court to assist the chief justice in his administrative duties and to assist the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary when it calls upon the office’s administrative powers.\n\nThe court has power to issue, hear and determine writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto, certiorari, prohibition and other remedial writs provided in statute and can be given further authority through statute. A justice of the court can issue the writ of habeas corpus to individuals held in custody if petitioned. Writs can be made to appear before any judge in the state.\nAside from hearing cases, the court is also responsible for administering the state's entire judicial system, establishing rules of operation for the state's other courts. The Oklahoma Supreme Court formulates the rules for the practice of law, which govern the conduct of attorneys, and it administers discipline in appropriate cases. Many of the justices make personal appearances to speak to members of the bar, civic clubs, and educational groups. These appearances are made to help citizens understand the court's workings and decision-making process. Justices are also called upon to administer official oaths of office to public officials.\n\nJudicial officers are charged with maintaining the integrity and independence of the judiciary. Justices are required to be nonpartisan and are prohibited from using their office or powers to promote or assist any private interest. Justices may not hold offices in political parties, make speeches for candidates, or contribute to campaigns for political office.\n\nJustices are also forbidden from campaigning for their own re-election unless there is an active opposition to their retention in office. Even if justices or judges are actively campaigning for retention, they can not personally raise funds for their campaign.\n\nThe Justices of the Oklahoma Supreme Court are:\n\nThis graphical timeline depicts the length of each current Supreme Court justice's tenure (but not seniority) on the Court:\n\nThe Chief Justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court is the highest ranking judicial officer in the State and is tasked with administering the state judiciary. Unlike the Supreme Court of the United States where one justice is specifically appointed to be chief, the office of Chief Justice rotates among the justices. The justice elect from among their members a chief justice and a vice chief justice to serve a two-year term. There are no term limits or age restrictions on the position.\n\nThere are currently five living retired justices of the Oklahoma Supreme Court: Daniel J. Boudreau, Steven W. Taylor, Joseph M. Watt, Patrick Wyrick and John Reif. As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court.\n\nMany of the internal operations of the Court are organized by seniority of justices, with the chief justice is considered the most senior member of the court followed by the vice-chief justice, regardless of the length of their service. The other justices are then ranked by the length of their service. During the sessions of the Court, the justices sit according to seniority, with the Chief Justice in the center, the Vice-Chief Justice to chief's immediate right, and the most senior Justice to the chief's immediate left. The remaining justices alternate sides, with the most junior justice being to the chief's furthest left. Thus, as of 2019, from the perspective of the audience, the justices sit as follows:\n\nThe court has nine seats for active justices, numbered in the order in which they were filled. Justices who retire into senior status have no role in the operations of court except as authorized by the court itself. That seat is filled by the next justices appointed by the governor.\n\nBeginning in 1968 with an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution approved in 1967, seats on the Supreme Court ceased being filled by partisan election and instead were filled by non-partisan appointment by the Governor of Oklahoma upon nomination by the Oklahoma Judicial Nominating Commission. Justices serve until the next general election following their appointment at which they are retained or rejected. If retained, they serve for an additional six-years until the next retention election.\nNote 1: <br>\nNote 2: <br>\nNote 3: <br>\nBar key: \nThe Kauger Court is the time since 2011 during which the Oklahoma Supreme Court has been led by Senior Justice Yvonne Kauger, who was appointed by Governor George Nigh in 1984.

Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission\", Oklahoma citizens challenged the placement of a Ten Commandments Monument on the grounds of the Oklahoma State Capitol under Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The Court ruled, \"We hold that the Ten Commandments Monument violates Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, is enjoined, and shall be removed\". The 7-2 ruling overturns a decision by a district court judge who determined the monument could stay. It prompted calls by a handful of Republican lawmakers for impeachment of the justices who said the monument must be removed. Since the original monument was erected in 2012, several other groups have asked to put up their own monuments on the Capitol grounds. Among them is a group that wants to erect a 7-foot-tall statue that depicts Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, wings and a long beard. A Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group, and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster also have made requests.\n\n"}

Schefferville is in the heart of the Naskapi and Innu territory in northern Quebec, less than 2 km from the border with Labrador on the north shore of Knob Lake. It is located within the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality and has an area of . Schefferville completely surrounds the autonomous Innu community of Matimekosh, and it abuts the small community of Lac-John Reserve. Both of the latter communities are First Nations Innu reserves. Schefferville is also close to the Naskapi reserved land of Kawawachikamach.\n\nThe isolated town is not connected to the provincial road network but is accessible by airplane via the Schefferville Airport or by train. Schefferville is the northern terminus of Tshiuetin Rail Transportation (formerly operated by the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway) with service to Sept-Îles.\n\nMcGill University operates the McGill Subarctic Research Station in Schefferville.\n\nSchefferville was established as a town in 1954 by the Iron Ore Company Of Canada to support the mining of rich iron ore deposits in the area. The original settlement was called \"Burnt Creek\" and was located some miles to the north of the current location of the town of Schefferville. When the plans were drawn up for the town, it was originally called \"Knob Lake\", after a prominent iron ore outcropping visible on a prominent hill south of the town site. The name Schefferville was adopted in honour of (Roman Catholic) Bishop Lionel Scheffer, who served as the Vicar Apostolic of Labrador from March 14, 1946, until his death on October 3, 1966.\n\nAt the time of the town's founding, Innu from Maliotenam and Naskapi from Fort Chimo were resettled to Schefferville to assist with geological exploration work and the railway construction. Following many years of neglect, in which they suffered destitute poverty, in 1968 parts of the town were set aside for them as a reserve. By 1972, housing units had been built. Most of the Naskapi and Innu moved to this new site, known today as Matimekosh Reserve.\n\nFor some years in the late 1950s, NORAD operated a radar station in Schefferville as part of the Mid-Canada Line, part of North America's defences against possible Soviet attack across the arctic.\n\nAt its peak in the late 1960s, Schefferville counted some 5,000 residents. But iron ore mining ceased there in 1982, on orders from Brian Mulroney, president of the Iron Ore Company. He later was elected as Prime Minister of Canada. When mine operations ceased, most of the 4,000 or so non-aboriginal occupants left. The remainder were mostly aboriginal people who had settled there in the preceding 30 years.\n\nIn 1986, the town ceased to exist as an incorporated legal entity, but this decision was reversed in 1990. Some houses and public facilities were demolished, while other parts of the infrastructure were added to the Matimekosh Reserve. Many of the remaining houses in the town are used as company housing by businesses active in the iron industry.\n\nAt the Canada 2011 Census, Schefferville had a population of 213 inhabitants, an increase of 5.4 percent from the 2006 census total of 202. In comparison, Matimekosh had a population of 540 and Lac-John, 21. The town counted 110 private dwellings occupied by usual residents out of a total of 178.\n\nMany Naskapi first nation people live mostly in the village of Kawawachikamach, northwest of Schefferville. They are mostly Anglican and Protestant and speak English as their second language. The Innu people reside mainly in Schefferville and Matimekosh. They are largely Roman Catholic and speak French as their second language.\n\nThe Naskapi and Montagnais/Innu languages are, generally, mutually intelligible. Most local inhabitants are able to speak varying amounts of all the local languages, and code-switching is common in conversation. The breakdown of mother tongues is:\n\nPopulation trend:\n\nAs a result of increased demand for steel and iron ore, two official projects are underway in the early 21st century to re-establish mining operations out of Schefferville.\n\nThe first is the LabMag Iron Ore Project, 30 kilometres west of Schefferville. The objective is to develop mining and concentrating near Schefferville that will mine 33 million tonnes of crude iron ore per year, in order to produce 10 million tonnes per year of concentrate and pellets for a minimum of 20 years. Mining production began in 2011. The Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach owns 20% of the LabMag Iron Ore Project.\n\nIn addition, Anglesey Mining had applied for final operational permits on its former Iron Ore Company of Canada deposits. Production was scheduled to start during late summer 2010, with output rising to two or three million tons of ore a year by 2012 before further deposits are developed. Innu protesters blocked access to Schefferville in July 2010. They delayed the start of mining with demands for increased compensation for the commercial exploitation of their traditional homelands.\n\nSchefferville has a subarctic climate (Köppen \"Dfc\"). Schefferville has cool summers relative to its latitude and inland location.\n\nThe cold winters are caused in part by the ice cover of Hudson Bay eliminating maritime moderation, causing an inland area between the Rockies and the Atlantic on the latitude. Although, Schefferville is nearer the Atlantic, the cold Labrador Current brings cold air also from the east. In summer, the Hudson Bay water is cold after just thawing, whereas the Labrador waters remains cool and prone to low-pressure systems under the Icelandic Low. As a result, even the vast landmass seldom builds up heat and remains extremely chilly for the latitude. Areas west of Hudson Bay on similar or higher latitudes are way warmer also in this time of the year as a result.\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

The tornado struck at approximately 2.30pm BST in the Sparkbrook area of the city, also affecting King's Heath, Moseley and Balsall Heath as it carved 7 kilometre-long path through the city. Its main effects were felt in the Ladypool Road which bore the brunt of the damage. Ladypool Primary School was extensively damaged and lost its distinctive Martin & Chamberlain tower.

Produced by Hal B. Wallis, the film stars Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Lizabeth Scott and features Kirk Douglas in his film debut.\n\nThe film was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival. In 1974, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\n\nOn a rainy night in 1928 in a Pennsylvania factory town called Iverstown, thirteen-year-old Martha Ivers tries to run away from the guardianship of her wealthy, domineering aunt, Mrs. Ivers, with her friend, the street-smart, poor Sam Masterson. She is caught and brought home where Martha's tutor, Walter O'Neil Sr., presents his timid son, Walter Jr., as the one responsible for Martha's recovery. Scolded by her aunt, Martha defiantly states her name is not Ivers, but Smith, her father's name.\n\nDuring a power failure, Sam comes for her, but Martha's aunt hears her calling to him from downstairs. While Sam slips out unnoticed, Mrs. Ivers starts beating Martha's kitten with her cane. Martha wrestles it away from her and strikes her across the head, causing her to fall down the staircase and die. When the power comes back on, Martha lies about the incident to Walter. Even though Walter Jr. saw everything, he backs her up. The greedy Walter Sr. makes it clear to both Walter Jr. and Martha that he knows what happened, but that as long as he and his son stand to benefit, he will play along. Sam leaves town.\n\nIn 1946, the elder Walter is now dead. Walter Jr. is now Iverstown's district attorney and is married to Martha, who has used her inheritance to expand the Ivers milling empire. Their marriage is one-sided; he loves her, but Walter knows that she does not love him.\n\nSam, now a former soldier and itinerant gambler, drives into the small town by chance and, after an accident, leaves his car to be repaired. While waiting, he goes to look at his old home, now a boarding house. He meets Antonia \"Toni\" Marachek, who has just been released from jail. She is later picked up for violating her probation by not returning to her hometown. Sam asks Walter to use his influence to get Toni released.\n\nWalter is convinced Sam has blackmail in mind. Sam then learns that Walter Sr. had presented Martha's version of the 1928 accidental murder to the police: that an intruder murdered Martha's aunt. With his leverage, Walter Sr. had made Martha marry his son. When the police identified a former employee of the aunt as the murderer, the two Walters and Martha had helped convict him, and he was hanged.\n\nWhen Martha reacts with joy at seeing Sam, a jealous Walter forces Toni to set him up. Sam is beaten up and driven out of town, but he is too tough to be intimidated. When all else fails, Walter makes a halfhearted attempt to kill Sam himself, but is easily disarmed. Martha then inadvertently blurts out the couple's fears of blackmail, only to learn that Sam did not witness the death. Martha breaks down and laments that he left without her all those years ago, taking with him her only chance for love and freedom.\n\nSam is torn between his old love and his new one with Toni. Although he eventually forgives Toni for betraying him, he and Martha spend an idyllic day together, rekindling his feelings for her.\n\nWalter arranges to meet Sam to finally settle matters. Before Sam arrives, Walter gets drunk and Martha finds out about the meeting. When Walter falls down the stairs, Martha urges Sam to kill her unconscious husband. Sam instead brings Walter around. Martha pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot Sam in \"self defense\" as an intruder. Sam tells her it would work, if she can get Walter to corroborate her story. Sam turns his back on her and leaves.\nWalter embraces and kisses Martha, then points the gun at her midriff. Oddly relieved, she puts her hand over his hand on the trigger and presses. As she is dying, she defiantly states her name is not Martha Ivers, but Martha Smith. Outside, Sam hears the shot. He runs back toward the mansion, but sees Walter, holding Martha's body, shoot himself. Sam and Toni drive away together.\n\nCast notes\n\nDirector Lewis Milestone left the film for several days in sympathy with a set decorators' strike which was going on at the time. In his absence, the film was directed by Byron Haskin, who did not receive screen credit. Stanwyck had considerable influence on how she was lit, and was not shy about putting her fellow actors on notice that she did not like to be upstaged. When she saw the coin trick Van Heflin had learned – at Milestone's suggestion, to show that Heflin's character was a professional gambler – she informed him he should make sure he did not do it during any of her important lines, since she had a bit of business that would upstage him, if she had to. With that she raised her skirt high and adjusted her garter. The result was that Heflin only used the trick once in a scene with her. Kirk Douglas later wrote that Stanwyck was indifferent to him at first, until at one point she focused on him and told him, \"Hey, you're pretty good.\" Douglas, smarting from having been ignored previously, replied, \"Too late, Miss Stanwyck,\" but the two got on well after that.\n\nSix months after the film's release, Milestone gave an interview in which he said he would never work for producer Hal B. Wallis again, because Wallis had wanted re-shoots in order to get more closeups of Lizabeth Scott. Milestone refused, telling Wallis to shoot them himself, and, according to the director, Wallis did.\n\nThe film's ad campaign consisted only of teasers before its release: Newspapers ran ads reading \"Whisper her name!\", while radio spots had a woman repeatedly whispering \"Martha Ivers\".\n\nJohn Patrick received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Original Motion Picture Story.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

From January 5 – November 30, 2012, he served as Senate Republican Caucus Chair, the second-ranking leadership position among Senate Republicans.\n\nHarman earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Kansas State University in 1963. Upon graduating, Harman joined the United States Army and became a lieutenant in the 4th Infantry Division. After completing his tour of duty, he entered Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, finishing near the top of his class and earning his J.D. in 1968.\n\nUpon graduating from Loyola, Harman joined the Long Beach law firm of Lucas & Deukmejian, whose partners were future California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and future Governor George Deukmejian.\n\nHarman and his wife, Dianne, moved to Huntington Beach in the 1970s to start a family. After the birth of his children, Michael and Michelle, Harman wanted to spend more time with his family, so he left Lucas & Deukmejian and started his own law firm, which he remained with for 27 years.\n\nIn 1995, Harman was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Huntington Beach City Council. City residents elected Harman to a full term in 1996. At the conclusion of his term, Harman was elected to the State Assembly with 62% of the vote in 2000 to represent the 67th District. He was re-elected with 69% of the vote in 2002 and 64% of the vote in 2004.

It was founded by Sir Wilfred Grenfell in 1892 as a branch of The Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen based in Britain. \n\nThe medical staff and volunteers of the Grenfell Mission were from many countries in addition to Canada, such as the United States, Scotland, and England. Roads between settlements did not exist during much of the time that the Grenfell Mission supplied services, so in summer, nurses and doctors travelled to patients by boat, and in the winter, by dog team or (in later years) airplane. Certain drugs and medical supplies were not available in the Mission's remote setting, so staff were obliged to use inventive procedures.\n\nTuberculosis occurred at epidemic proportions in the 1940s in northern Newfoundland and Labrador. \"The role that the Grenfell Mission played in the near eradication of tuberculosis was indeed one of its most outstanding achievements\".\n\nIn 1914, the Mission Incorporated as the International Grenfell Association. The organization was governed by a Board of Directors with representatives of the five supporting organizations - the Grenfell Association of America (New York), the New England Grenfell Association (Boston), the Grenfell Association of Great Britain and Ireland (London), the Grenfell Labrador Medical Mission (Ottawa), and the Grenfell Association of Newfoundland (St. John's). It functioned in this capacity until 1981, when responsibility for health services in the region transferred to the provincial government. In 2005, the Labrador-Grenfell Regional Authority was formed with the support of the provincial government to continue to provide care to around 37,000 people in northern Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThe Grenfell Mission established a Village Industry Department prior to 1930. Artists came from abroad to support the artistic endeavors of the residents of northern Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThe Grenfell Mission was famous for its burlap rugs, which were sold to hospitals in the United States and Britain. Encouraged and promoted by Dr. Grenfell, the rugmakers of the mission sometimes used designs created by Mrs. Grenfell. Beginning in the early 20th century, the International Grenfell Association (IGA) hired Jessie Luther of Providence, Rhode Island, to set up and direct the Grenfell Industrial Department. Grenfell established retail shops in England and in several U.S. cities. These shops were staffed by volunteers and augmented by travelling salesmen.

This tree is in the same genus as the coihue. It regenerates easily after fires. The wood is of good quality, moderate durability, and is easy to work with. It is used in furniture, shingles and construction and sometimes as a substitute for American black cherry in the manufacturing of cabinets.\n\nIn southern Patagonia it grows to a height of up to 30 m (100 ft), and attains a trunk diameter of 1.5 m (5 ft). In more northern regions it grows only at heights above 1000 meters (3300 ft) in the form of a shrub. The leaves are dark green, elliptic toothed and 2–4 cm long, with irregularly lobed margins, and turn to yellow and reddish tones in autumn. The fruit is a small nut 4–7 mm long.\n\nThe lenga beech can be found in the Torres del Paine National Park, Tierra del Fuego National Park, Los Alerces National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park among other places. In its southerly range it occurs in dense stands as far south as Navarino Island. It grows in areas with low temperatures and abundant snow; therefore, in the north half of its distribution it is found only in the Andes Range and at sea level on its southernmost natural environment. It tolerates temperatures −30 °C (−22 °F) and lower, and frosts all seasons of the year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332399", "title": "Mandalay Palace", "text": "Mandalay Palace\n\nThe Mandalay Palace (, ), located in Mandalay, Myanmar, is the last royal palace of the last Burmese monarchy. The palace was constructed between 1857 and 1859 as part of King Mindon's founding of the new royal capital city of Mandalay. The plan of Mandalay Palace largely follows the traditional Burmese palace design, inside a walled fort surrounded by a moat. The palace itself is at the centre of the citadel and faces east. All buildings of the palace are of one storey in height. The number of spires above a building indicated the importance of the area below.\n\nMandalay Palace was the primary royal residence of King Mindon and King Thibaw, the last two kings of the country. The complex ceased to be a royal residence and seat of government on 28 November 1885 when, during the Third Anglo-Burmese War, troops of the Burma Field Force entered the palace and captured the royal family. The British turned the palace compound into Fort Dufferin, named after the then viceroy of India. Throughout the British colonial era, the palace was seen by the Burmese as the primary symbol of sovereignty and identity. Much of the palace compound was destroyed during World War II by allied bombing; only the royal mint and the watch tower survived. A replica of the palace was rebuilt in the 1990s with some modern materials.\n\nToday, Mandalay Palace is a primary symbol of Mandalay and a major tourist destination.\n\nThe Mandalay Palace's formal name in Burmese is \"Mya Nan San Kyaw\" ( ; \"The Famed Royal Emerald Palace\"). It is also known as (), or the \"Great Golden Royal Palace\".\n\nThe Mandalay Palace was constructed as part of King Mindon's founding of Mandalay in February 1857. Large parts of the palace were reconstructed from the palace at Amarapura, which was relocated to Mandalay. The master plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned city, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the centre by Mandalay Hill. The 413-hectare royal palace compound was surrounded by four 2 km (6666 ft) long walls and a moat 64 m (210 ft) wide, 4.5 m (15 ft) deep. Along the wall were bastions with gold-tipped spires at intervals of 169 m (555 ft). The walls had three gates on each side, twelve in total, each presenting a zodiac sign. The citadel had five bridges to cross the moat.\n\nIn June 1857, the construction of the palace began. After the disastrous Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, the shrunken Burmese kingdom had few resources to build a new ostentatious palace. The former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay Hill. The construction of the palace compound was officially completed on Monday, 23 May 1859.\n\nThe British invaded and ransacked the palace and burned down the royal library.The royal regalia of Burma were removed as military booty and displayed in the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A Museum, London). In 1964 they were returned to Burma as a gesture of goodwill The British renamed the palace compound Fort Dufferin and used it to billet troops. During World War II, the palace citadel was turned into a supply depot by the Japanese and was carelessly burnt to the ground by Allied bombing. Only the royal mint and the watch tower survived.\n\nReconstruction of the palace began in 1989, initiated by the Department of Archaeology. Because government funds were insufficient, the Mandalay Committee for the palace Reconstruction was formed, with funds coming from the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which patronized this project. The regional governments of Mandalay, Magwe and Sagaing Divisions were responsible for drawing up architectural plans and constructing various parts of the palace:\n\nWhile the overall design was faithful, the construction process incorporated both traditional and modern building techniques. Corrugated sheet metal was used for the roofing of most buildings, while concrete was extensively used as a building material (the original palace was built using only teak.\n\nOne of the halls was dismantled during the rule of King Thibaw and rebuilt as Shwenandaw Monastery. It is the single remaining major structure of the original wooden palace today.\n\nThe palace citadel's four 2 km long walls form a perfect square, complete with a total of 48 bastions with gold tipped \"pyatthats\" or spires at regular intervals of 169 m (555 ft) and surrounded by a moat 64 m (210 ft) wide, 4.5 m (15 ft) deep. The walls, built with the common Burmese bricks set in mud mortar, are 3 m (10 ft) thick at the base and 1.47 m (4 ft 10 in) at the top; 6.86 m (22.5 ft) in height, excluding the merlons, and 8.23 m (27 ft) with the merlons. The embrasures are 0.84 m (2 ft 9 in) in width. To give access to the battlements in cases of alert and at the same time to strengthen the wall, an earthen rampart on a moderately inclined plane has been thrown up behind it. Its summit forms a platform 1.83 m (2 ft) wide, paved with bricks and running all along the walls behind the crenelles.\n\nOn each face of the walls are three gateways placed at equal distances (508 m; 1666.5 ft) one from the other and from the corners.\nEach of the twelve gates, represented by its own zodiac sign, is 4.8 m (15.75 ft) wide and flanked on both sides by one-half of a bastion which supports the post of a many-tiered pavilion or pyatthat that rises over the gateway. The pyatthats over middle gates, used by the royalty, have seven tiers while those on the rest have only five. Of these twelve gates, the main one was the central gate in the east wall, facing the Great Hall of Audience and the Lion Throne in the Palace.\n\nThe bastion projects 7 m (23 ft) from the face of the wall, and is 10.36 m (34) ft in breadth on each side of the gateway. It is ornamented on the outside, with simple mouldings and simple plaster carvings, but on the inner face which forms the prolongation of the gateway itself, it rises abruptly without any plinth or mouldings, from the ground level. Two flights of steps, one on each side of the gateway, provide access to the top of the bastion and the wall. Each gateway was equipped with a thick wooden door of two leaves, (which were removed after the British annexation).\n\nThe entrance to each gateway is protected by a masonry screen or barbican erected a few metres away from the moat in front of the entrance. It is 17.5 m (57 ft 5 in) in length, 5.2 m (17 ft) thick, 1.5 m (1 ft 8 in) in height, raised on a low plinth, and battering to the top. The summit is crowned by crenellated battlements on three sides only, the inner side facing the gate being left open and free. Access to the top could be gained by means of ladders, no other means of going up having been provided. It served as an advanced defence work protecting both the gate and the bridge a few feet away. By the side of this screen is a huge teak pillar resting on a brick plinth stepped off on two sides, and carrying near the top a wooden board on which is carved an inscription giving the name of the gate, and the year and date on which it was built.\n\nEach of the four walls has 13 bastions for a total of 48 bastions. (Bastions at each corner are merged into one, hence 48 in total.) All the intermediate bastions are surmounted by a quintuple-roof pavilion. The barge-board of these many-gabled roofs are covered with carvings.\n\nSurrounding the walls, at a distance of about 18 m (60 ft) from them, is a moat 64 m (210 ft) wide, and of an average depth of 4.5 m (15 ft). In the case of foes armed with ancient weapons, this moat would no doubt have presented a rather formidable obstacle to the besieging army, whose crafts would have been completely exposed to the missiles of the warriors protected by the merlons on the ramparts and on the barbicans.\n\nThe moat was originally spanned over by five wooden bridges, four of which lead to the four principal or middle gates, that is one to each face of the walls. The fifth leads up to the south-western gate, used during the times of monarchy for \"amingala\" or inauspicious occasions such as to carry off dead bodies. The British constructed two additional bridges one at the south-west and the other at the north-west corner, to allow of materials and supplies for the troops into the fort.\n\nThe five original bridges are similar in design and are in unison with the defensive character of the fort and the moat. Two earthen embankments encased within brick walls form the abutments running into the moat from both banks. The space between is spanned over by teak logs of natural size — the length of two of these logs making up the length of the bridge resting, at both extremities on transversal beams supported by five posts partially encased in the masonry of the abutments; the extremities of the logs which meet in the middle of the bridge are likewise supported by five huge wooden pillars the heads of which are joined together by means of two large wooden plates which rest on cleats so constructed that the whole structure could be taken down and removed rapidly in case of danger.\n\nEntering the Palace grounds from the east, on the right or north sits the Clock Tower, or \"Bahozin\" (). It is a simple building, consisting of a high square plinth; on the top of this four columns sustain a wooden platform surmounted by a double-roof; the whole is crowned by a small finial and a hti or umbrella. It is from this platform that the passing of time was made known to the city by sounding regularly a gong and a very large drum at each watch, that is, every third hour; the day and the night were each divided into four watches. The time was marked by a water-clock. This consisted of a large water jar on the water of which was placed a brass bowl; in the bottom of the latter was pierced a tiny hole, its size so calculated that the bowl filled with water and dropped to the bottom of the jar at exact recurring intervals, which were the hours.\n\nTo the south of the Clock Tower, nearly facing it across the road is \"Swedawzin\" () or the Tooth-Relic Tower. A good example of traditional Burmese architecture, the Relic Tower has three parts — first a low basement; second a rectangular block or terrace rising from the first and third a relic-chamber surmounted by a three-tiered roof (pyatthat); the whole is crowned by the usual finial and the hti. Along the four sides of both basement and terrace runs a battlemented parapet formed of lozenge ornaments; at the four corners of each are small square pillars each surmounted by a marble manussiha or winged leogryph; the monster has a human head and two bodies.\n\nThe relic-chamber on the terrace is square; the only entrance into it is on the west, facing the flight of stairs by which access is obtained to the top of the terrace; these narrow steps are enclosed between two brick walls, ornamented with copings in three tiers; the lower end of each coping is terminated by a large and graceful volute; this kind of ornamental stairs, with minor\ndifferences in details, may be seen all over Burma, either in brick or wood. The walls and roofs of the relic-chamber are adorned with graceful plaster carvings.\n\nAlthough the building is called the Tooth Relic Tower, there never was any tooth-relic enshrined in it. The tower was built\nsimply because it was the tradition to have such a tower at the royal city, a tradition from the time of King Bayinnaung.\n\nThe \"Hluttaw\" (, ) or the Supreme Court was where the official business of the court was conducted. The Lion Throne (Sihasana) was the chief throne of eight in the palace. The hall consists of two three-roofed wooden structures, richly decorated with figures and flowers, and supported by massive teak pillars painted red at the bottom and gilded above. Therein was a Lion-Throne (Sihasana) for the King.\n\nDue north from the Clock Tower is a cluster of Mausoleums erected to the memory of some members of the Royal family. The most important historically is that of King Mindon, who died in 1878. It was originally a brick pyatthat, plastered over and whitewashed, erected by King Thibaw to the memory of his father, as soon as the grave had been built. The Sawbwa of Yawnghwe, decorated the king's tomb with glass mosaic. It is a square structure surmounted by a septuple roof terminating as usual in a hti. Other mausoleums include those of three wives of Mindon: Chief Queen; Queen Laungshe, mother of King Thibaw; Queen Hsinbyumashin, mother of Queen Supayalat.\n\nThe Royal Mint is located a few hundred metres to the northeast of the mausoleums. It was where the first Burmese coin was minted in 1865. After the British annexation, the Mint was used as bakery for the troops for some years. It was one of few buildings in the palace that survived allied bombing during World War II.\n\nThe palace grounds are dominated by the 24 m (78 ft) tall \"Nanmyintsaung\" () or Watch Tower, topped by a seven tiered \"pyatthat\". It was the spot from which to view the city. The King and Queen sometimes ascended the tower to witness the beautiful panorama of the country around, with its river, the bills and lakes. They also, from its summit, contemplated the magnificent spectacle of the illumination of the town at the Thadingyut festival at the end of Vassa ('Buddhist Lent'). It is said that Queen Supayalat witnessed, from there, the entry of the British troops who took Mandalay in November 1885. The Watch Tower also survived the allied bombing during World War II.\n\nThe road from the Eastern Gate, which passes between the Clock Tower and the Relic Tower, leads to the Mye-Nandaw, and the Golden Spire over the Lion Throne Room, which marks the centre of the city. All the Palace buildings stood on the platform. The latter consists of three distinct parts: on the east, the Great Audience Hall and the Lion Throne Room are erected on an earthen basement contained by a brick wall; the whole of the western portion, from the western most extremity up to and including the Hman-nan or Glass Palace, is likewise an earthen basement surrounded by a masonry wall; these two basements are connected, from the Hman-nan up to the Lion Throne Room, by a plank flooring of the same level supported by numerous teak posts. The whole of this platform, in its greatest length, measures 306 m (1,004 ft); in its greatest width, 175 m (574 ft). The height of the basement is 2 m (6 ft 9 in), the surrounding or retaining wall rising to a height of 3 m (10 ft 9 in) from the surrounding ground, and forming a parapet 1.2 m (4 ft) from the basement. Access to the top of the basement was obtained by thirty-one flights of steps, some large and some quite small, the principal of which are those at the eastern and western extremities.\n\nThis Hall itself is made up of three parts: the North (or Left) Audience Hall, and the South (or Right) Audience Hall; they were so called because, when the King was seated on the Throne, facing the east, the first was to his left and the second to his right. These two parts or wings are connected by a transept running east to west from the flight of steps up to the railing around the throne; this transept was called the Central Audience Hall, because it was flanked by the Right and Left Halls. The Great Audience Hall as a whole measures, from north to south, 77.1 m (253 feet).\n\nBelow the Palace platform, on each side of the flight of steps, on the east, may be seen a few old pattern European cannons and near them some heaps of cannonballs; a few other guns of the same pattern are placed also on the sides of the steps on the west front of the Palace.\n\nThe Great Audience Hall was built with a special eye to external effect, and this object was attained by carving and gilding all the wooden parts of the roofs-except the panels between the two roofs, which were merely gilt-that is, the gables, barge-boards and eaves-boards. The carving is in low relief and consists principally of a lotus and foliage-band on the eaves-boards; the barge-boards are ornamented with a plain scroll design and surmounted by flamboyant which are very effective as a decoration. But the wealth of ornamentation is lavished on the corners of the hipped roofs and the points of the gables as well as their lower extremities. The corners of the hipped (lower) roofs are surmounted by two wooden boards, made up of several joined pieces\nand meeting so as to form a right angle at the corner; the chief motifs are flamboyant, foliage, lotus-bands and guilloches.\n\nThe angle represents a stylized peacock—the emblem of royalty—is surmounted by a finial; below the eaves-boards is a pendant turned in the lathe. This same peacock is everywhere found at the points of the gables, forming a hip-knob, with the pendant below. All these carvings, besides being gilt, were also decorated with simple glass mosaic. The details above given apply mostly to all the other apartments.\n\nThere were eight thrones in the Palace, of which the Lion Throne (, \"Sihasana Palanka\") was the greatest, and as such much more elaborately sculptured and finished than the others; an exact replica of the one in the Palace was formerly in the Hluttaw. The King alone, of course, had a right to sit on it; and for anybody else to do so would be considered a case of high treason; the fact indeed was that anybody sitting on this throne was practically the King, if he could keep the rightful owner off. The base is a lotus throne formed of two lotuses, the upper one inverted on the top of the other; this pattern in no way differs from an ordinary altar supporting a Buddha image; but in the centre, where it is narrowest, that is, at the point where the two lotuses meet, is a small band containing a row of niches, with a somewhat larger one above it; in these niches were small figures of lions, besides the two large ones which may be seen now at each side of the Throne. Access to the Throne was obtained by means of a flight of steps in the room behind it from which it is shut off by a sliding door of gilt iron lattice work.\n\nThe other thrones were the Hintha Throne (), Elephant Throne (\"Gajasana\") in the Byedaik (Privy Council Hall), Thinga Throne, Deer Throne (\"Migasana\"), Peacock Throne (\"Marurasana\"), Lily Throne (), and Bee Throne (\"Bhamarasana\").\n\nThe original Lion Throne was saved from destruction in the bombings of World War II, because it was transported by the British authorities to India in 1885 after the Third Anglo-Burmese War, and later returned. It is now exhibited in the National Museum of Myanmar in Yangon.\n\n\"Hmannandawgyi\" () or Glass Palace, is the largest and considered one of the most beautiful apartments of the Palace. It is believed to be King Mindon's principal living apartment of the palace. Like all the Throne rooms, it is divided by a wooden partition into two rooms.\n\nIn the east room is the Bee Throne (Bhamarasana), so called because it was adorned with figures of bees in the small niches at the bottom of the pedestal. This was where the ceremony for the nomination of the Chief Queen and the Royal nuptial were held. It was also where the king and queen celebrated the Burmese New Year, and where the formal ear piercing of young princesses took place. The body of King Mindon was laid out in this room for viewing after his death in 1878.\n\nThe west room, which was formerly divided into several smaller ones, was the principal living room of Mindon, and no other persons were allowed to sleep there except the four principal queens, to each of whom was appointed a room near the royal bed-chamber, which consisted of a small room surmounted by a pyatthat, or small spire consisting of seven superposed roofs similar to the Golden Spire over the Lion Throne Room on the cast of the Palace. This pyatthat was of gilt copper. On each side of this spired-room were constantly kept open two white umbrellas. The ladies-in-waiting of the Glass Palace were, by turns, stationed around the west room to wait upon. Their Majesties; they, whether princesses or minor queens, were not allowed to enter this room with slippers on or with their golden umbrellas: they had to leave these at the entrance with their attendants.\n\nIn the time of King Thibaw, Queen Supayalat had a small room to herself in this west room of the Hmannan.\n\n"}

It was the band's second new album to be released in 2002, and it marked quite a few changes. After releasing records (and cassettes) on small record labels such as Shrimper, Ajax, and Emperor Jones, \"Tallahassee\" was the first Mountain Goats album to be released on a widely known independent label, the British alternative rock label 4AD. It was also the first Mountain Goats album to have an official single released, for the song \"See America Right.\"\n\n\"Tallahassee\" is the first record to feature what could be considered a full \"band,\" with fuller instrumentation and a percussion section. Up to this point, most recordings under the Mountain Goats name have either been solo recordings by leader John Darnielle or higher-quality recordings featuring Rachel Ware on bass, and other supporting instrumentalists. On \"Tallahassee\", Darnielle is joined by two past collaborators, multi-instrumentalists Peter Hughes and Franklin Bruno. It was co-produced, recorded, and mixed by producer Tony Doogan at Tarbox Studios in Cassadaga, New York, assisted by Michael Ivins of The Flaming Lips. The album was recorded in six days.\n\n\"Tallahassee\" is completely devoted to two of Darnielle's recurring characters, a married couple constantly on the edge of divorce. As such, the lyrics tend to focus on the dysfunction in their relationship. The couple is known to fans as \"the Alpha Couple,\" as many of the previous songs about them have titles beginning with the word \"Alpha\" (e.g. \"Alpha Incipiens,\" \"Alpha Desperation March\"). The final song on the album is titled \"Alpha Rats Nest\" as a nod of sorts to the other songs.\n\nIn the songs on this album, the Alpha Couple move into a house on Southwood Plantation Road in Tallahassee, Florida. The house is falling apart, a metaphor for their crumbling marriage. Sick of themselves and each other, yet unwilling to part, they begin drinking themselves to death.\n\nThe album's liner notes, presumably written from the husband's point of view, add another dimension to the story, as does the album's (now defunct) promotional website, written by Darnielle and designed by his wife Lalitree.\n\nThe music online magazine \"Pitchfork\" gave \"Tallahassee\" a 6.7 out of 10 when it first released, as well as putting it at number 176 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.

{"id": "2332422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332422", "title": "Carcinogenesis", "text": "Carcinogenesis\n\nCarcinogenesis, also called oncogenesis or tumorigenesis, is the formation of a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. The process is characterized by changes at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and abnormal cell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost all tissues and under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form of apoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues and organs. According to the prevailing accepted theory of carcinogenesis, the somatic mutation theory, mutations in DNA and epimutations that lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by natural selection in the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.\n\nVariants of inherited genes may predispose individuals to cancer. In addition, environmental factors such as carcinogens and radiation cause mutations that may contribute to the development of cancer. Finally random mistakes in normal DNA replication may result in cancer causing mutations. A series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell. On average, for example, 15 \"driver mutations\" and 60 \"passenger\" mutations are found in colon cancers. Mutations in genes that regulate cell division, apoptosis (cell death), and DNA repair may result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer.\n\nCancer is fundamentally a disease of regulation of tissue growth. In order for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered. Genetic and epigenetic changes can occur at many levels, from gain or loss of entire chromosomes, to a mutation affecting a single DNA nucleotide, or to silencing or activating a microRNA that controls expression of 100 to 500 genes. There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by these changes. Oncogenes may be normal genes that are expressed at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties. In either case, expression of these genes promotes the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are often disabled by cancer-promoting genetic changes. Finally Oncovirinae, viruses that contain an oncogene, are categorized as oncogenic because they trigger the growth of tumorous tissues in the host. This process is also referred to as viral transformation.\n\nThere is a diverse classification scheme for the various genomic changes that may contribute to the generation of cancer cells. Many of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. There are also many epigenetic changes that alter whether genes are expressed or not expressed. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change that is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis. Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal region, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.\n\nDNA damage is considered to be the primary cause of cancer. More than 60,000 new naturally-occurring instances of DNA damage arise, on average, per human cell, per day, due to endogenous cellular processes (see article DNA damage (naturally occurring)).\n\nAdditional DNA damage can arise from exposure to exogenous agents. As one example of an exogenous carcinogenic agent, tobacco smoke causes increased DNA damage, and this DNA damage likely cause the increase of lung cancer due to smoking. In other examples, UV light from solar radiation causes DNA damage that is important in melanoma, \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection produces high levels of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and contribute to gastric cancer, and the \"Aspergillus flavus\" metabolite aflatoxin is a DNA damaging agent that is causative in liver cancer.\n\nDNA damage can also be caused by substances produced in the body. Macrophages and neutrophils in an inflamed colonic epithelium are the source of reactive oxygen species causing the DNA damage that initiates colonic tumorigenesis, and bile acids, at high levels in the colons of humans eating a high-fat diet, also cause DNA damage and contribute to colon cancer.\n\nSuch exogenous and endogenous sources of DNA damage are indicated in the boxes at the top of the figure in this section. The central role of DNA damage in progression to cancer is indicated at the second level of the figure. The central elements of DNA damage, epigenetic alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.\n\nA deficiency in DNA repair would cause more DNA damage to accumulate, and increase the risk for cancer. For example, individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) are at increased risk of cancer, with some defects causing an up to 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations). Such germline mutations are shown in a box at the left of the figure, with an indication of their contribution to DNA repair deficiency. However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about \"one percent\" of cancers.\n\nThe majority of cancers are called non-hereditary or \"sporadic cancers\". About 30% of sporadic cancers do have some hereditary component that is currently undefined, while the majority, or 70% of sporadic cancers, have no hereditary component.\n\nIn sporadic cancers, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene; much more frequently, reduced or absent expression of DNA repair genes is due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence gene expression. This is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level from the top. For example, for 113 colorectal cancers examined in sequence, only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration).\n\nWhen expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, this causes a DNA repair deficiency. This is shown in the figure at the 4th level from the top. With a DNA repair deficiency, DNA damage persists in cells at a higher than typical level (5th level from the top in figure); this excess damage causes an increased frequency of mutation and/or epimutation (6th level from top of figure). Experimentally, mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in Homologous recombinational repair (HRR). Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR-defective cells During repair of DNA double-strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damage, incompletely-cleared repair sites can cause epigenetic gene silencing.\n\nThe somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations caused by DNA damage and deficiencies in DNA repair accumulate in field defects. Field defects are normal-appearing tissues with multiple alterations (discussed in the section below), and are common precursors to development of the disordered and over-proliferating clone of tissue in a cancer. Such field defects (second level from bottom of figure) may have numerous mutations and epigenetic alterations.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the initial cause for most specific cancers. In a few cases, only one cause exists: for example, the virus HHV-8 causes all Kaposi's sarcomas. However, with the help of cancer epidemiology techniques and information, it is possible to produce an estimate of a likely cause in many more situations. For example, lung cancer has several causes, including tobacco use and radon gas. Men who currently smoke tobacco develop lung cancer at a rate 14 times that of men who have never smoked tobacco: the chance of lung cancer in a current smoker being caused by smoking is about 93%; there is a 7% chance that the smoker's lung cancer was caused by radon gas or some other, non-tobacco cause. These statistical correlations have made it possible for researchers to infer that certain substances or behaviors are carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke causes increased exogenous DNA damage, and this DNA damage is the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. Among the more than 5,000 compounds in tobacco smoke, the genotoxic DNA-damaging agents that occur both at the highest concentrations, and which have the strongest mutagenic effects are acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene.\n\nUsing molecular biological techniques, it is possible to characterize the mutations, epimutations or chromosomal aberrations within a tumor, and rapid progress is being made in the field of predicting certain cancer patients' prognosis based on the spectrum of mutations. For example, up to half of all tumors have a defective p53 gene. This mutation is associated with poor prognosis, since those tumor cells are less likely to go into apoptosis or programmed cell death when damaged by therapy. Telomerase mutations remove additional barriers, extending the number of times a cell can divide. Other mutations enable the tumor to grow new blood vessels to provide more nutrients, or to metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body. However, once a cancer is formed it continues to evolve and to produce sub-clones. It was reported in 2012 that a single renal cancer specimen, sampled in nine different areas, had 40 \"ubiquitous\" mutations, found in all nine areas, 59 mutations shared by some, but not all nine areas, and 29 \"private\" mutations only present in one area.\n\nThe lineages of cells in which all these DNA alterations accumulate are difficult to trace, but two recent lines of evidence suggest that normal stem cells may be the cells of origin in cancers. First, there exists a highly positive correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.81; P < 3.5 × 10−8) between the risk of developing cancer in a tissue and the number of normal stem cell divisions taking place in that same tissue. The correlation applied to 31 cancer types and extended across five orders of magnitude. This correlation means that if normal stem cells from a tissue divide once, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 1X. If they divide 1,000 times, the cancer risk is 1,000X. And if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide 100,000 times, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 100,000X. This strongly suggests that the main factor in cancer initiation is the fact that \"normal\" stem cells divide, which implies that cancer originates in normal, healthy stem cells. \n\nSecond, statistics show that most human cancers are diagnosed in older people. A possible explanation is that cancers occur because cells accumulate damage through time. DNA is the only cellular component that can accumulate damage over the entire course of a life, and stem cells are the only cells that can transmit DNA from the zygote to cells late in life. Other cells, derived from stem cells, do not keep DNA from the beginning of life until a possible cancer occurs. This implies that most cancers arise from normal stem cells.\n\nThe term \"field cancerization\" was first used in 1953 to describe an area or \"field\" of epithelium that has been preconditioned by (at that time) largely unknown processes so as to predispose it towards development of cancer. Since then, the terms \"field cancerization\" and \"field defect\" have been used to describe pre-malignant tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.\n\nField defects have been identified in association with cancers and are important in progression to cancer. However, it was pointed out by Rubin that \"the vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors in vivo, or on discrete neoplastic foci in vitro. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion…\" More than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. It would also be expected that many of the epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.\n\nIn the colon, a field defect probably arises by natural selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells at the base of one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells by natural selection. This may cause a patch of abnormal tissue to arise. The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. Below the photo there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur, so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to its neighbors, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally, forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer). In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3 cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated (in the diagram below the photo) by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon. In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose its inner surface and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.\n\nIf the general process by which sporadic colon cancers arise is the formation of a pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality, reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) would reflect the earliest event in formation of a malignant neoplasm.\n\nIn experimental evaluation of specific DNA repair deficiencies in cancers, many specific DNA repair deficiencies were also shown to occur in the field defects surrounding those cancers. The table below gives examples for which the DNA repair deficiency in a cancer was shown to be caused by an epigenetic alteration, and the somewhat lower frequencies with which the same epigenetically-caused DNA repair deficiency was found in the surrounding field defect.\n\nSome of the small polyps in the field defect shown in the photo of the opened colon segment may be relatively benign neoplasms. In a 1996 study of polyps less than 10mm in size found during colonoscopy and followed with repeat colonoscopies for 3 years, 25% remained unchanged in size, 35% regressed or shrank in size and 40% grew in size.\n\nCancers are known to exhibit genome instability or a \"mutator phenotype\". The protein-coding DNA within the nucleus is about 1.5% of the total genomic DNA. Within this protein-coding DNA (called the exome), an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein altering mutations, of which about 3 or 4 may be \"driver\" mutations, and the remaining ones may be \"passenger\" mutations. However, the average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome (including non-protein-coding regions) within a breast cancer tissue sample is about 20,000. In an average melanoma tissue sample (melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency),) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000. These high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defect giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in the preceding section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. Large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to about 10 cm on each side of a cancer) are found to frequently have epigenetic defects in two or three DNA repair proteins (ERCC1, ERCC4 (XPF) and/or PMS2) in the entire area of the field defect. When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damage accumulates in cells at a higher than normal rate, and this excess damage causes an increased frequency of mutation and/or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damage to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis of some of the damaged areas may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of this accumulated DNA damage may give rise to epimutations. These new mutations and/or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage.\n\nThere are a number of theories of carcinogenesis and cancer treatment that fall outside the mainstream of scientific opinion, due to lack of scientific rationale, logic, or evidence base. These theories may be used to justify various alternative cancer treatments. They should be distinguished from those theories of carcinogenesis that have a logical basis within mainstream cancer biology, and from which conventionally testable hypotheses can be made.\n\nSeveral alternative theories of carcinogenesis, however, are based on scientific evidence and are increasingly being acknowledged. Some researchers believe that cancer may be caused by aneuploidy (numerical and structural abnormalities in chromosomes) rather than by mutations or epimutations. Cancer has also been considered as a metabolic disease, in which the cellular metabolism of oxygen is diverted from the pathway that generates energy (oxidative phosphorylation) to the pathway that generates reactive oxygen species. This causes an energy switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg's hypothesis), and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress (\"oxidative stress theory of cancer\").\n\nA number of authors have questioned the assumption that cancers result from sequential random mutations as oversimplistic, suggesting instead that cancer results from a failure of the body to inhibit an innate, programmed proliferative tendency. A related theory suggests that cancer is an atavism, an evolutionary throwback to an earlier form of multicellular life. The genes responsible for uncontrolled cell growth and cooperation between cancer cells are very similar to those that enabled the first multicellular life forms to group together and flourish. These genes still exist within the genomes of more complex metazoans, such as humans, although more recently evolved genes keep them in check. When the newer controlling genes fail for whatever reason, the cell can revert to its more primitive programming and reproduce out of control. The theory is an alternative to the notion that cancers begin with rogue cells that undergo evolution within the body. Instead, they possess a fixed number of primitive genes that are progressively activated, giving them finite variability. Another evolutionary theory puts the roots of cancer back to the origin of the eukaryote (nucleated) cell by massive horizontal gene transfer, when the genomes of infecting viruses were cleaved (and thereby attenuated) by the host, but their fragments integrated into the host genome as immune protection. Cancer thus originates when a rare somatic mutation recombines such fragments into a functional driver of cell proliferation.\n\nOften, the multiple genetic changes that result in cancer may take many years to accumulate. During this time, the biological behavior of the pre-malignant cells slowly changes from the properties of normal cells to cancer-like properties. Pre-malignant tissue can have a distinctive appearance under the microscope. Among the distinguishing traits of a pre-malignant lesion are an increased number of dividing cells, variation in nuclear size and shape, variation in cell size and shape, loss of specialized cell features, and loss of normal tissue organization. Dysplasia is an abnormal type of excessive cell proliferation characterized by loss of normal tissue arrangement and cell structure in pre-malignant cells. These early neoplastic changes must be distinguished from hyperplasia, a reversible increase in cell division caused by an external stimulus, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation.\n\nThe most severe cases of dysplasia are referred to as \"carcinoma in situ.\" In Latin, the term \"in situ\" means \"in place\"; \"carcinoma in situ\" refers to an uncontrolled growth of dysplastic cells that remains in its original location and has not shown invasion into other tissues. Carcinoma in situ may develop into an invasive malignancy and is usually removed surgically when detected.\n\nJust as a population of animals undergoes evolution, an unchecked population of cells also can undergo \"evolution\". This undesirable process is called somatic evolution, and is how cancer arises and becomes more malignant over time.\n\nMost changes in cellular metabolism that allow cells to grow in a disorderly fashion lead to cell death. However, once cancer begins, cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: the few cells with new genetic changes that enhance their survival or reproduction multiply faster, and soon come to dominate the growing tumor as cells with less favorable genetic change are out-competed. This is the same mechanism by which pathogenic species such as MRSA can become antibiotic-resistant and by which HIV can become drug-resistant), and by which plant diseases and insects can become pesticide-resistant. This evolution explains why a cancer relapse often involves cells that have acquired cancer-drug resistance or resistance to radiation from radiotherapy).\n\nIn a 2000 article by Hanahan and Weinberg, the biological properties of malignant tumor cells were summarized as follows:\n\nThe completion of these multiple steps would be a very rare event without:\n\nThese biological changes are classical in carcinomas; other malignant tumors may not need to achieve them all. For example, given that tissue invasion and displacement to distant sites are normal properties of leukocytes, these steps are not needed in the development of leukemia. Nor do the different steps necessarily represent individual mutations. For example, inactivation of a single gene, coding for the p53 protein, will cause genomic instability, evasion of apoptosis and increased angiogenesis. Further, not all the cancer cells are dividing. Rather, a subset of the cells in a tumor, called cancer stem cells, replicate themselves as they generate differentiated cells.\n\nNormally, once a tissue is injured or infected, damaged cells elicit inflammation by stimulating specific patterns of enzyme activity and cytokine gene expression in surrounding cells. Discrete clusters (\"cytokine clusters\") of molecules are secreted, which act as mediators, inducing the activity of subsequent cascades of biochemical changes. Each cytokine binds to specific receptors on various cell types, and each cell type responds in turn by altering the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways, depending on the receptors that the cell expresses and the signaling molecules present inside the cell. Collectively, this reprogramming process induces a stepwise change in cell phenotypes, which will ultimately lead to restoration of tissue function and toward regaining essential structural integrity. A tissue can thereby heal, depending on the productive communication between the cells present at the site of damage and the immune system. One key factor in healing is the regulation of cytokine gene expression, which enables complementary groups of cells to respond to inflammatory mediators in a manner that gradually produces essential changes in tissue physiology. Cancer cells have either permanent (genetic) or reversible (epigenetic) changes to their genome, which partly inhibit their communication with surrounding cells and with the immune system. Cancer cells do not communicate with their tissue microenvironment in a manner that protects tissue integrity; instead, the movement and the survival of cancer cells become possible in locations where they can impair tissue function. Cancer cells survive by \"rewiring\" signal pathways that normally protect the tissue from the immune system.\n\nOne example of tissue function rewiring in cancer is the activity of transcription factor NF-κB.\nNF-κB activates the expression of numerous genes involved in the transition between inflammation and regeneration, which encode cytokines, adhesion factors, and other molecules that can change cell fate. This reprogramming of cellular phenotypes normally allows the development of a fully functional intact tissue. NF-κB activity is tightly controlled by multiple proteins, which collectively ensure that only discrete clusters of genes are induced by NF-κB in a given cell and at a given time. This tight regulation of signal exchange between cells protects the tissue from excessive inflammation, and ensures that different cell types gradually acquire complementary functions and specific positions. Failure of this mutual regulation between genetic reprogramming and cell interactions allows cancer cells to give rise to metastasis. Cancer cells respond aberrantly to cytokines, and activate signal cascades that can protect them from the immune system.\n\nThe role of iodine in marine fishes (rich in iodine) and freshwater fishes (iodine-deficient) is not completely understood, but it has been reported that freshwater fishes are more susceptible to infectious and, in particular, neoplastic and atherosclerotic diseases, than marine fishes. Marine elasmobranch fishes such as sharks, stingrays etc. are much less affected by cancer than freshwater fishes, and therefore have stimulated medical research to better understand carcinogenesis.\n\nIn order for cells to start dividing uncontrollably, genes that regulate cell growth must be dysregulated. Proto-oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and mitosis, whereas tumor suppressor genes discourage cell growth, or temporarily halt cell division to carry out DNA repair. Typically, a series of several mutations to these genes is required before a normal cell transforms into a cancer cell. This concept is sometimes termed \"oncoevolution.\" Mutations to these genes provide the signals for tumor cells to start dividing uncontrollably. But the uncontrolled cell division that characterizes cancer also requires that the dividing cell duplicates all its cellular components to create two daughter cells. The activation of anaerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), which is not necessarily induced by mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, provides most of the building blocks required to duplicate the cellular components of a dividing cell and, therefore, is also essential for carcinogenesis.\n\nOncogenes promote cell growth through a variety of ways. Many can produce hormones, a \"chemical messenger\" between cells that encourage mitosis, the effect of which depends on the signal transduction of the receiving tissue or cells. In other words, when a hormone receptor on a recipient cell is stimulated, the signal is conducted from the surface of the cell to the cell nucleus to affect some change in gene transcription regulation at the nuclear level. Some oncogenes are part of the signal transduction system itself, or the signal receptors in cells and tissues themselves, thus controlling the sensitivity to such hormones. Oncogenes often produce mitogens, or are involved in transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which creates the proteins and enzymes responsible for producing the products and biochemicals cells use and interact with.\n\nMutations in proto-oncogenes, which are the normally quiescent counterparts of oncogenes, can modify their expression and function, increasing the amount or activity of the product protein. When this happens, the proto-oncogenes become oncogenes, and this transition upsets the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, making uncontrolled growth possible. The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, even if this were possible, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis of the organism. It is only when they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.\n\nOne of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the ras oncogene. Mutations in the Ras family of proto-oncogenes (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% of all human tumours. Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised that not only is this gene present in the human genome but also, when ligated to a stimulating control element, it could induce cancers in cell line cultures.\n\nProto-oncogenes promote cell growth in a variety of ways. Many can produce hormones, \"chemical messengers\" between cells that encourage mitosis, the effect of which depends on the signal transduction of the receiving tissue or cells. Some are responsible for the signal transduction system and signal receptors in cells and tissues themselves, thus controlling the sensitivity to such hormones. They often produce mitogens, or are involved in transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which create the proteins and enzymes responsible for producing the products and biochemicals cells use and interact with.\n\nMutations in proto-oncogenes can modify their expression and function, increasing the amount or activity of the product protein. When this happens, they become oncogenes, and, thus, cells have a higher chance of dividing excessively and uncontrollably. The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis of the body. It is only when they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.\nIt is important to note that a gene possessing a growth-promoting role may increase the carcinogenic potential of a cell, under the condition that all necessary cellular mechanisms that permit growth are activated. This condition also includes the inactivation of specific tumor suppressor genes (see below). If the condition is not fulfilled, the cell may cease to grow and can proceed to die. This makes identification of the stage and type of cancer cell that grows under the control of a given oncogene crucial for the development of treatment strategies.\n\nTumor suppressor genes code for anti-proliferation signals and proteins that suppress mitosis and cell growth. Generally, tumor suppressors are transcription factors that are activated by cellular stress or DNA damage. Often DNA damage will cause the presence of free-floating genetic material as well as other signs, and will trigger enzymes and pathways that lead to the activation of tumor suppressor genes. The functions of such genes is to arrest the progression of the cell cycle in order to carry out DNA repair, preventing mutations from being passed on to daughter cells. The p53 protein, one of the most important studied tumor suppressor genes, is a transcription factor activated by many cellular stressors including hypoxia and ultraviolet radiation damage.\n\nDespite nearly half of all cancers possibly involving alterations in p53, its tumor suppressor function is poorly understood. p53 clearly has two functions: one a nuclear role as a transcription factor, and the other a cytoplasmic role in regulating the cell cycle, cell division, and apoptosis.\n\nThe Warburg hypothesis is the preferential use of glycolysis for energy to sustain cancer growth. p53 has been shown to regulate the shift from the respiratory to the glycolytic pathway.\n\nHowever, a mutation can damage the tumor suppressor gene itself, or the signal pathway that activates it, \"switching it off\". The invariable consequence of this is that DNA repair is hindered or inhibited: DNA damage accumulates without repair, inevitably leading to cancer.\n\nMutations of tumor suppressor genes that occur in germline cells are passed along to offspring, and increase the likelihood for cancer diagnoses in subsequent generations. Members of these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The tumor types are typical for each type of tumor suppressor gene mutation, with some mutations causing particular cancers, and other mutations causing others. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that an affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from the other. For instance, individuals who inherit one mutant \"p53\" allele (and are therefore heterozygous for mutated \"p53\") can develop melanomas and pancreatic cancer, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Other inherited tumor suppressor gene syndromes include \"Rb\" mutations, linked to retinoblastoma, and \"APC\" gene mutations, linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer. Adenopolyposis colon cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in colon while young, leading to colon cancer at a relatively early age. Finally, inherited mutations in \"BRCA1\" and \"BRCA2\" lead to early onset of breast cancer.\n\nDevelopment of cancer was proposed in 1971 to depend on at least two mutational events. In what became known as the Knudson two-hit hypothesis, an inherited, germ-line mutation in a tumor suppressor gene would cause cancer only if another mutation event occurred later in the organism's life, inactivating the other allele of that tumor suppressor gene.\n\nUsually, oncogenes are dominant, as they contain gain-of-function mutations, while mutated tumor suppressors are recessive, as they contain loss-of-function mutations. Each cell has two copies of the same gene, one from each parent, and under most cases gain of function mutations in just one copy of a particular proto-oncogene is enough to make that gene a true oncogene. On the other hand, loss of function mutations need to happen in both copies of a tumor suppressor gene to render that gene completely non-functional. However, cases exist in which one mutated copy of a tumor suppressor gene can render the other, wild-type copy non-functional. This phenomenon is called the \"dominant negative effect\" and is observed in many p53 mutations.\n\nKnudson's two hit model has recently been challenged by several investigators. Inactivation of one allele of some tumor suppressor genes is sufficient to cause tumors. This phenomenon is called haploinsufficiency and has been demonstrated by a number of experimental approaches. Tumors caused by haploinsufficiency usually have a later age of onset when compared with those by a two hit process.\n\nIn general, mutations in both types of genes are required for cancer to occur. For example, a mutation limited to one oncogene would be suppressed by normal mitosis control and tumor suppressor genes, first hypothesised by the Knudson hypothesis. A mutation to only one tumor suppressor gene would not cause cancer either, due to the presence of many \"backup\" genes that duplicate its functions. It is only when enough proto-oncogenes have mutated into oncogenes, and enough tumor suppressor genes deactivated or damaged, that the signals for cell growth overwhelm the signals to regulate it, that cell growth quickly spirals out of control. Often, because these genes regulate the processes that prevent most damage to genes themselves, the rate of mutations increases as one gets older, because DNA damage forms a feedback loop.\n\nMutation of tumor suppressor genes that are passed on to the next generation of not merely cells, but their offspring, can cause increased likelihoods for cancers to be inherited. Members within these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from another. Because mutations in tumor suppressors act in a recessive manner (note, however, there are exceptions), the loss of the normal copy creates the cancer phenotype. For instance, individuals that are heterozygous for p53 mutations are often victims of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and that are heterozygous for Rb mutations develop retinoblastoma. In similar fashion, mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene are linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer, with thousands of polyps in the colon while young, whereas mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.\n\nA new idea announced in 2011 is an extreme version of multiple mutations, called \"chromothripsis\" by its proponents. This idea, affecting only 2–3% of cases of cancer, although up to 25% of bone cancers, involves the catastrophic shattering of a chromosome into tens or hundreds of pieces and then being patched back together incorrectly. This shattering probably takes place when the chromosomes are compacted during normal cell division, but the trigger for the shattering is unknown. Under this model, cancer arises as the result of a single, isolated event, rather than the slow accumulation of multiple mutations.\n\nMany mutagens are also carcinogens, but some carcinogens are not mutagens. Examples of carcinogens that are not mutagens include alcohol and estrogen. These are thought to promote cancers through their stimulating effect on the rate of cell mitosis. Faster rates of mitosis increasingly leave fewer opportunities for repair enzymes to repair damaged DNA during DNA replication, increasing the likelihood of a genetic mistake. A mistake made during mitosis can lead to the daughter cells' receiving the wrong number of chromosomes, which leads to aneuploidy and may lead to cancer.\n\n\"Helicobacter pylori\" can cause gastric cancer. Although the data varies between different countries, overall about 1% to 3% of people infected with \"Helicobacter pylori\" develop gastric cancer in their lifetime compared to 0.13% of individuals who have had no \"H. pylori\" infection. \"H. pylori\" infection is very prevalent. As evaluated in 2002, it is present in the gastric tissues of 74% of middle-aged adults in developing countries and 58% in developed countries. Since 1% to 3% of infected individuals are likely to develop gastric cancer, \"H. pylori\"-induced gastric cancer is the third highest cause of worldwide cancer mortality as of 2018. \n\nInfection by \"H. pylori\" causes no symptoms in about 80% of those infected. About 75% of individuals infected with \"H. pylori\" develop gastritis. Thus, the usual consequence of \"H. pylori\" infection is chronic asymptomatic gastritis. Because of the usual lack of symptoms, when gastric cancer is finally diagnosed it is often fairly advanced. More than half of gastric cancer patients have lymph node metastasis when they are initially diagnosed. \n\nThe gastritis caused by \"H. pylori\" is accompanied by inflammation, characterized by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages to the gastric epithelium, which favors the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). The substantial presence of ROS/RNS causes DNA damage including 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). If the infecting \"H. pylori\" carry the cytotoxic cagA gene (present in about 60% of Western isolates and a higher percentage of Asian isolates), they can increase the level of 8-OHdG in gastric cells by 8-fold, while if the \"H. pylori\" do not carry the cagA gene, the increase in 8-OHdG is about 4-fold. In addition to the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG, \"H. pylori\" infection causes other characteristic DNA damages including DNA double-strand breaks. \n\n\"H. pylori\" also causes many epigenetic alterations linked to cancer development. These epigenetic alterations are due to \"H. pylori\"-induced methylation of CpG sites in promoters of genes and \"H. pylori\"-induced altered expression of multiple microRNAs.\nAs reviewed by Santos and Ribeiro \"H. pylori\" infection is associated with epigenetically reduced efficiency of the DNA repair machinery, which favors the accumulation of mutations and genomic instability as well as gastric carcinogenesis. In particular, Raza et al. showed that expression of two DNA repair proteins, ERCC1 and PMS2, was severely reduced once \"H. pylori\" infection had progressed to cause dyspepsia. Dyspepsia occurs in about 20% of infected individuals.. In addition, as reviewed by Raza et al., human gastric infection with \"H. pylori\" causes epigenetically reduced protein expression of DNA repair proteins MLH1, MGMT and MRE11. Reduced DNA repair in the presence of increased DNA damage increases carcinogenic mutations and is likely a significant cause of \"H. pylori\" carcinogenesis.\n\nFurthermore, many cancers originate from a viral infection; this is especially true in animals such as birds, but less so in humans. 12% of human cancers can be attributed to a viral infection. The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, \"acutely transforming\" or \"slowly transforming\". In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is obligatory part of retroviruses, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral promoter or other transcription regulation elements, in turn, cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene, which, in turn, induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming virus, which already carries the viral-oncogene.\n\nViruses that are known to cause cancer such as HPV (cervical cancer), Hepatitis B (liver cancer), and EBV (a type of lymphoma), are all DNA viruses. It is thought that when the virus infects a cell, it inserts a part of its own DNA near the cell growth genes, causing cell division. The group of changed cells that are formed from the first cell dividing all have the same viral DNA near the cell growth genes. The group of changed cells are now special because one of the normal controls on growth has been lost.\n\nDepending on their location, cells can be damaged through radiation, chemicals from cigarette smoke, and inflammation from bacterial infection or other viruses. Each cell has a chance of damage. Cells often die if they are damaged, through failure of a vital process or the immune system, however, sometimes damage will knock out a single cancer gene. In an old person, there are thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of knocked-out cells. The chance that any one would form a cancer is very low.\n\nWhen the damage occurs in any area of changed cells, something different occurs. Each of the cells has the potential for growth. The changed cells will divide quicker when the area is damaged by physical, chemical, or viral agents. A vicious circle has been set up: Damaging the area will cause the changed cells to divide, causing a greater likelihood that they will suffer knock-outs.\n\nThis model of carcinogenesis is popular because it explains why cancers grow. It would be expected that cells that are damaged through radiation would die or at least be worse off because they have fewer genes working; viruses increase the number of genes working.\n\nOne thought is that we may end up with thousands of vaccines to prevent every virus that can change our cells. Viruses can have different effects on different parts of the body. It may be possible to prevent a number of different cancers by immunizing against one viral agent. It is likely that HPV, for instance, has a role in cancers of the mucous membranes of the mouth.\n\nCertain parasitic worms are known to be carcinogenic. These include:\n\n\nEpigenetics is the study of the regulation of gene expression through chemical, non-mutational changes in DNA structure. The theory of epigenetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes to DNA can lead to alterations in gene expression. Normally, oncogenes are silent, for example, because of DNA methylation. Loss of that methylation can induce the aberrant expression of oncogenes, leading to cancer pathogenesis. Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to chromosomal DNA at specific locations. Classes of medications, known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, can re-regulate the epigenetic signaling in the cancer cell.\n\nEpimutations include methylations or demethylations of the CpG islands of the promoter regions of genes, which result in repression or de-repression, respectively of gene expression. Epimutations can also occur by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation or other alterations to histones, creating a histone code that represses or activates gene expression, and such histone epimutations can be important epigenetic factors in cancer. In addition, carcinogenic epimutation can occur through alterations of chromosome architecture caused by proteins such as HMGA2. A further source of epimutation is due to increased or decreased expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). For example, extra expression of miR-137 can cause downregulation of expression of 491 genes, and miR-137 is epigenetically silenced in 32% of colorectal cancers>\n\nA new way of looking at carcinogenesis comes from integrating the ideas of developmental biology into oncology. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that the different kinds of cells in a heterogeneous tumor arise from a single cell, termed Cancer Stem Cell. Cancer stem cells may arise from transformation of adult stem cells or differentiated cells within a body. These cells persist as a subcomponent of the tumor and retain key stem cell properties. They give rise to a variety of cells, are capable of self-renewal and homeostatic control. Furthermore, the relapse of cancer and the emergence of metastasis are also attributed to these cells. The cancer stem cell hypothesis does not contradict earlier concepts of carcinogenesis. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has been a proposed mechanism that contributes to tumour heterogeneity.\n\nWhile genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes change the behavior of cells, those alterations, in the end, result in cancer through their effects on the population of neoplastic cells and their microenvironment. Mutant cells in neoplasms compete for space and resources. Thus, a clone with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene will expand only in a neoplasm if that mutation gives the clone a competitive advantage over the other clones and normal cells in its microenvironment. Thus, the process of carcinogenesis is formally a process of Darwinian evolution, known as somatic or clonal evolution. Furthermore, in light of the Darwinistic mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it has been theorized that the various forms of cancer can be categorized as pubertal and gerontological. Anthropological research is currently being conducted on cancer as a natural evolutionary process through which natural selection destroys environmentally inferior phenotypes while supporting others. According to this theory, cancer comes in two separate types: from birth to the end of puberty (approximately age 20) teleologically inclined toward supportive group dynamics, and from mid-life to death (approximately age 40+) teleologically inclined away from overpopulated group dynamics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2332430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332430", "title": "Coattail effect", "text": "Coattail effect\n\nThe coattail effect or down-ballot effect is the tendency for a popular political party leader to attract votes for other candidates of the same party in an election. For example, in the United States, the party of a victorious presidential candidate will often win many seats in Congress as well; these Members of Congress are voted into office \"on the coattails\" of the president.\n\nThis theory is prevalent at all levels of government. A popular statewide candidate for governor or senator can attract support for down ballot races of their party as well.\n\nThis is prevalent in the United Kingdom and Canada especially in a general election. People have a tendency to vote on the basis of a political party instead of the MP for their area.\n\nThis also refers to the phenomenon that members of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are more likely to be voted for on a year of the presidential election than a midterm.\n\nThe \"coattail effect\" is not usually caused by a popular candidate convincing swing voters to cast their ballots for their party, although this is not unheard of. Rather, the effect often stems from popular candidates driving voter turnout among their own party base, people who are likely to vote for down-ballot party candidates anyway.\n\nThe \"coattail effect\" has also been used to derogatorily describe the effect of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) in Singapore, where candidates for Parliament run on a party slate of 3 to 6 candidates. This allows weak candidates to get elected \"riding on the coattails\" of strong candidates on their slate.\n\nRiding the coattails is a metaphor that refers to one who achieves some level of success or notability primarily through association with someone else. This can often be used as a generic phrase for anyone that hangs onto another person as they forge ahead, without effort from the hanger-on.\n\nPresidential coattails is the ability of a presidential candidate to bring out supporters who then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. In effect, the other candidates are said to ride on his coattails. Before the introduction of the secret ballot in the late 19th century, voters cast their ballots by taking a ticket provided by a party worker and putting it in the ballot box. The party-column ballot listed all candidates of the party in a single column and allowed the voter to mark off the party box at the top, which encouraged straight-party voting and the coattails effect. Straight-party voting was the norm, and winners in presidential elections often had long coattails. They almost always began their term with majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nIn modern times voting machines have replaced the party-column ballot with the office-column ballot: candidates are grouped by office rather than party. Often there is no way to cast a party-line vote, and each office must be voted on separately. The proportion of voters choosing House and presidential candidates of different parties increased from 13 percent in 1952 to more than 40 percent in the elections of 1972, 1980, and 1988. Consequently, Presidential coattails have been virtually eliminated in most elections, and a number of Presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, have begun their terms with one or both chambers of Congress controlled by the opposition party.\n\nPresidents may suffer from a \"reverse coattail\" effect in which their party's candidates for the House or Senate get more votes than the presidents themselves. In 1976, for example, Jimmy Carter won the White House with 40,831,881 votes, but Democratic candidates for the House that year received 41,749,411 votes. In 1992, almost all Democrats elected to Congress won more votes in their congressional districts than the party's presidential candidate, Bill Clinton; that may have had to do with the presence of a strong third-party presidential candidate, Ross Perot.\n\nThere is also the \"negative coattail\" effect in which a controversial presidential candidate may hurt candidates on the party's ticket running for lower offices. Goldwater's poor showing in the presidential election of 1964 led to the defeat of dozens of Republicans in the House of Representatives, leaving Johnson a large Democratic majority to pass his agenda. The negative coattail effect is also common in midterm elections - when a President associated with unpopular policies is not up for re-election, the electorate will often respond by punishing Congressional candidates from the President's own party. The Presidential elections of 1948 and 1952 are the most recent elections in which the same party both won the White House and took control of the House from their opponents. Since 1952, control of the House has changed hands five times, all of which were in midterm elections (1954, 1994, 2006, 2010 and 2018) and all of which were at the expense of the incumbent President's party. \n\nSince the end of World War II, there have been a total of five American presidential elections that had coattail effects: Harry Truman in 1948, Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nSingapore introduced the GRC system in 1969, where candidates for Parliament run and are elected on a slate of 3 to 6 candidates in some constituencies, with a minimum of one minority candidate on each slate. The purported aim was to ensure minority representation in Parliament. However, it resulted in a \"coattail effect\" where unpopular and even unknown candidates are elected because they ran together with popular candidates (usually Ministers) on the same slate.\n\nDespite the official reason cited, it was later stated by former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong that it was used to recruit able people to join politics, particularly since the GRC system reduced the losses of the ruling party. In Singapore, the ruling People's Action Party maintains almost total dominance in Parliament with the GRC system. As of 2015, there were only 6 fully elected Opposition MPs in the 89-seat Parliament.\n\n"}
{"id": "2332440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332440", "title": "Louis Plamondon", "text": "Louis Plamondon\n\nLouis Plamondon (born July 31, 1943) is a Canadian politician who has represented Bécancour—Nicolet—Saurel (formerly known as Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour and Richelieu) in the House of Commons since 1984, making him the Dean of the House, the longest-serving current member of the House of Commons.\n\nPlamondon has won his seat in ten consecutive federal elections, winning twice as a Progressive Conservative before becoming a founding member of the Bloc Québécois in 1990, after which he has been reelected eight more times. He, along with six other Bloc MPs, resigned from the Bloc's caucus to sit as an independent MP on February 28, 2018 citing conflicts with the leadership style of Martine Ouellet. He rejoined the Bloc Québécois caucus on September 17, 2018.\n\nPlamondon was born in Saint-Raymond-de-Portneuf, Quebec and is the brother of lyricist Luc Plamondon. He has a teaching certificate from L'École normale Maurice L. Duplessis (1964), a Bachelor of Arts degree from Laval University (1968), and a B.A.An. from the University of Montreal (1976). He was a math teacher and restaurant owner before entering political life. Plamondon supported the \"oui\" side in Quebec's 1980 referendum on sovereignty.\n\nPlamondon was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1984 federal election, defeating Liberal Party incumbent Jean-Louis Leduc in Richelieu. The Progressive Conservatives won a landslide majority government in this election under Brian Mulroney's leadership, and Plamondon entered parliament as a government backbencher. He was associated with the Quebec nationalist wing of his party and soon became known as a maverick. In 1986, he criticized justice minister John Crosbie for appointing an anglophone to replace the sole francophone judge on the Ontario Court of Appeal. He later criticized industry minister Sinclair Stevens for awarding a multimillion-dollar untendered contract to a shipbuilding company in Quebec City. Plamondon also expressed sympathy with fellow MP Robert Toupin, who left the Progressive Conservatives in May 1986 to sit as an independent.\n\nPlamondon was on the socially liberal wing of the Progressive Conservative Party. He voted against a motion to re-introduce capital punishment in 1987 and later opposed efforts to restrict abortion services. He strongly supported the Mulroney government's efforts to strengthen official bilingualism and criticized dissident anglophone Tory MPs who tried to weaken the government's reforms.\n\nPlamondon was also one of the more pro-labour members of the Tory caucus. In 1985, he promoted a partnership between the federal and Quebec governments and the Quebec Federation of Labour's Solidarity Fund. Two years later, he stood with striking letter carriers in Sorel and criticized his own government's decision to approve replacement workers. He was prominent among a group of Quebec Tory MPs who tried to reduce the party's reliance on corporate donations. Ricardo López, a right-wing Quebec Tory MP, once suggested that Plamondon would be more suited to the social democratic New Democratic Party.\n\nPlamondon was re-elected without difficulty in the 1988 federal election, as the Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government across the country. Over the following year, he became even more strongly aligned with the Quebec nationalist wing of his party. He supported Quebec premier Robert Bourassa's use of the Canadian constitution's notwithstanding clause to prohibit outdoor English-language signs, and expressed regret that the ban was not extended to indoor signs. He also criticized D'Iberville Fortier, Canada's official languages commissioner, for suggesting that Quebec was acting in an unjust manner toward its anglophone minority.\n\nConsistent with his nationalist views, Plamondon was a vocal supporter of the Mulroney government's proposed Meech Lake Accord on constitutional reform and opposed Jean Charest's efforts to modify the accord in early 1990. During this period, Plamondon speculated that sovereignty-association between Quebec and Canada would be \"logical and reasonable\" if the accord failed and added that he might become a \"Quebec-only MP\" in that event. When the accord was rejected in June 1990, Plamondon resigned from the Progressive Conservative caucus and informed the House of Commons that he could no longer support a united Canada.\n\nPlamondon was one of a group of Progressive Conservative and Liberal MPs from Quebec who left their parties after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. This group soon coalesced as the Bloc Québécois under the leadership of Lucien Bouchard. The Bloc was not initially given official recognition in the House of Commons, and its members were designated as independent MPs. Plamondon was recognized as the Bloc's house leader in 1992.\n\nIn its original form, the Bloc Québécois was a loose alliance of parliamentarians rather than a formal political party. Plamondon was one of the first Bloquistes to promote the creation of a strong party organization to challenge the Progressive Conservative Party's Quebec machine in the next federal election. Others, including Lucien Bouchard, initially favoured a weaker party structure that would simply allow Bloc candidates to have their party designation appear on the ballot. The vision favoured by Plamondon ultimately won out, and the Bloc became a strong political organization throughout Quebec.\n\nShortly after joining the BQ, Plamondon asked the federal government to apologize to the province of Quebec and provide financial compensation for those who were wrongly arrested under the War Measures Act in the 1970 FLQ Crisis. He later spoke against a bid by Izzy Asper to bring his Global Television Network to Montreal, arguing that the market was already saturated. In 1992, he described Mordechai Richler's book \"Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!\" as hate literature.\n\nPlamondon was charged with attempting to hire a prostitute during an undercover sting operation in April 1993. He claimed innocence, saying that the charge was the result of a \"bad joke between friends which lasted 45 seconds,\" but nonetheless resigned as his party's house leader pending resolution of the matter. He was renominated as the Bloc candidate for Richelieu despite the controversy.\n\nPlamondon was re-elected without difficulty in the 1993 federal election, as the Bloc won fifty-four out of seventy-five seats in Quebec to become the official opposition in the House of Commons. The Liberal Party won a majority government under the leadership of Jean Chrétien. At his own request, Plamondon was left out of the Bloc's initial shadow cabinet. He pleaded guilty to the charge against him in April 1994, maintaining his innocence but adding that he simply wanted to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. He received an absolute discharge and does not have a criminal record.\n\nPlamondon co-chaired a funding and membership drive for the Bloc in early 1995. He opposed finance minister Paul Martin's austerity budget in the same year, arguing that it placed an unfair financial burden on the provinces to fight the federal deficit. He personally opposed the Chrétien government's gun registry legislation, which the Bloc supported, and he absented himself from the parliamentary vote that led to its passage.\n\nAfter a narrow federalist victory in Quebec's 1995 referendum on sovereignty, Lucien Bouchard left the Bloc Québécois to become leader of its provincial counterpart, the Parti Québécois (PQ). Plamondon initially favoured Bernard Landry to become the Bloc's new leader, arguing that he was the best positioned of all candidates to unite the party's different factions. Landry decided not to run, and Gilles Duceppe eventually succeeded Bouchard as leader.\n\nPlamondon supported the Chrétien government's choice of Dyane Adam to become Canada's official language commissioner in 1998, saying that she would be \"tougher\" than her predecessor Victor Goldbloom (whom he nonetheless acknowledged had done good work on education matters). He endorsed Adam's criticism of the Chrétien government in 2000, when she wrote that it was not sufficiently committed to defending official bilingualism. Plamondon strongly opposed the Clarity Act legislation introduced by intergovernmental affairs minister Stéphane Dion in 1999, arguing that it would create confusion in any future referendum on Quebec sovereignty.\n\nPaul Martin replaced Jean Chrétien as Liberal Party leader and prime minister in late 2003. Shortly before he was sworn in, Plamondon published a short book entitled \"Le mythe Paul Martin\". As its title implies, the work was highly critical of its subject: Plamondon accused Martin of damaging Quebec's interests during his time in the Chrétien cabinet. He also argued that Martin would become an ally of United States president George W. Bush, neglect the low-income citizens of Canada and Quebec, and favour the interests of English Canada. The Bloc distributed one thousand free copies of the book, and a further fifteen hundred copies were put on sale in bookstores. Martin's supporters dismissed the work as a negative campaign ploy lacking any progressive vision, and Liberal MP Don Boudria asked the speaker of the House of Commons to investigate whether Plamondon had broken parliamentary rules by using publicly funded research staff to help compile the book.\n\nIt was initially believed that Paul Martin's Liberals would win a majority of seats in Quebec at the expense of the Bloc, but the Liberal Party's fortunes were instead damaged by the sponsorship scandal, in which some advertising revenues approved by the Chrétien government to promote Canadian federalism in Quebec were found to have been misused. The Bloc soon re-established itself as the dominant federal party in Quebec, and the Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 2004 federal election. Plamondon was chosen as BQ caucus chair in the new parliament.\n\nWhen Bernard Landry resigned as Parti Québécois leader in 2005, rumours circulated that Gilles Duceppe would run to succeed him. Plamondon said that most Bloc MPs wanted Duceppe to stay in federal politics but would respect his decision one way or the other. Duceppe chose to remain with the Bloc, and André Boisclair became PQ leader.\n\nPlamondon was elected to a seventh term in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservative Party won a minority government under the leadership of Stephen Harper. Widely respected as an electoral strategist, Plamondon later prepared an internal brief examining why the Bloc lost seats in the Quebec City area to the Conservatives. He remained as the Bloc's caucus chair.\n\nAndré Boisclair resigned as Parti Québécois leader after a poor showing in the 2007 provincial election, and rumours again circulated that Duceppe would run to succeed him. This time, Plamondon told reporters that Duceppe should run for the provincial leadership to impose discipline on the notoriously unruly party. Some in the PQ objected to this comment, which galvanized resistance to a Duceppe candidacy. Duceppe eventually entered the leadership contest, but withdrew after only one day due to poor polling and a growing sense that the sovereigntist movement would be divided if he won. He stayed as leader of the Bloc, and Plamondon helped ensure his successful transition back to the federal scene.\n\nWhen Brian Mulroney released his memoirs in September 2007, he alleged that Lucien Bouchard had conspired with Jacques Parizeau to create the Bloc Québécois while still a federal cabinet minister. Plamondon rejected this, arguing that Bouchard was loyal to Mulroney until resigning in protest against the government's handling of the Meech Lake Accord. Plamondon also criticized Jean Chrétien later in the year, when Chrétien wrote in his memoirs that he would not have recognized a narrow sovereigntist victory in the 1995 referendum.\n\nPlamondon was re-elected to an eighth term in the 2008 election as the Conservatives won a second consecutive minority government. He was again chosen as BQ caucus chair and, as the longest-serving member of the House of Commons, was also recognized as Dean of the House. Plamondon presided over the Commons when it re-elected Peter Milliken as its speaker in October 2008 and acknowledged the irony that an MP from a sovereigntist party would hold this position.\n\nPlamondon was returned by the narrowest margin of his career in the 2011 federal election following a strong challenge from the New Democratic Party (NDP). Gilles Duceppe was personally defeated in his riding and subsequently resigned as party leader. Plamondon was chosen as the Bloc's acting house leader and, in the absence of a full-time leader, became its main parliamentary spokesperson. He remains Dean of the House and presided over the Commons when it chose Andrew Scheer to be Milliken's successor as speaker on June 2, 2011.\n\n\nPlamondon was the Bloc candidate in his riding for the 2015 Canadian federal election, and was the only Bloc MP elected in 2011 to be running under the party banner again. He was re-elected to a tenth term in the House of Commons, presiding over the House as it elected Geoff Regan as Speaker. He was reelected to an 11th term in October 2019, to retain his position as Dean of the House and preside over the election of Anthony Rota as Speaker.\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Double-headed Serpent\", he ranks 34th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Xie Zhen as seven \"chi\" tall, powerfully built and having a purplish face, wide shoulders and a narrow waist. Nicknamed \"Double-headed Serpent\", Xie Zhen usually wears the hide of a tiger or a leopard as his outer garment. Skilled in martial arts, agile in climbing hills and able to endure bad weathers, Xie Zhen and his younger brother Xie Bao each use a bronze forked spear in hunting, which is also their weapon in combat. \n\nThe governor of Dengzhou (登州; in present-day eastern Shandong) orders Xie Zhen and Xie Bao, the best among local hunters, to hunt down a tiger in three days which has preyed on travelers on a ridge, failing which they would face severe punishment. On the second night, the brothers trap the tiger, corner it on a cliff, and fire poison arrows at it. The tiger falls off the cliff and lands in the backyard of the mansion of one Squire Mao. As they are clambering down the hill, Squire Mao orders his son Mao Zhongyi to take the tiger, now dead, to the governor to claim reward.\n\nFinding no tiger, the brothers are infuriated and smash the furniture in Mao's mansion before leaving. They run into Mao Zhongyi, who lures them back to his home where they are seized in an ambush. They are sent to the governor who jails them on the charge of theft. Squire Mao bribes the chief warden to murder them in prison.\n\nYue He, a jailer in the prison, happens to be related to them, his sister being the wife of Sun Li, whose brother Sun Xin is married to Gu Dasao, a cousin of the Xies. Sun Li is the commandant of Dezhou's garrison. Yue takes the news of the Xies to Sun Xin and Gu Dasao. The couple rope in Zou Yuan and Zou Run to help in the rescue. They also pressure Sun Li to join in. On the day of rescue, Yue He opens the prison gate to let in Gu Dasao, who pretends to bring food to the Xies. After admitting her, Yue unlocks the manacles that shackle the Xies to a bed.

Nicknamed \"Twin-tailed Scorpion\", he ranks 35th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Xie Bao as seven \"chi\" tall, dark-complexioned and having a round face. Each of his ankles is tattooed with a flying yaksha. Nicknamed \"Twin-tailed Scorpion\", Xie Bao usually wears the hide of a tiger or a leopard as his outer garment, just like his elder brother Xie Zhen. Skilled in martial arts, agile in climbing hills and able to endure bad weathers, the brothers each use a bronze forked spear in hunting, which is also their weapon in combat. When he is enraged, Xie Bao could shake things around him with his roar. \n\nThe governor of Dengzhou (登州; in present-day eastern Shandong) orders Xie Zhen and Xie Bao, the best among local hunters, to hunt down a tiger in three days which has preyed on travelers on a ridge, failing which they would face severe punishment. On the second night, the brothers trap the tiger, corner it on a cliff, and fire poison arrows at it. The tiger falls off the cliff and lands in the backyard of the mansion of one Squire Mao. As they are clambering down the hill, Squire Mao orders his son Mao Zhongyi to take the tiger, now dead, to the governor to claim reward.\n\nFinding no tiger, the brothers are infuriated and smash the furniture in Mao's mansion before leaving. They run into Mao Zhongyi, who lures them back to his home where they are seized in an ambush. They are sent to the governor who jails them on the charge of theft. Squire Mao bribes the chief warden to murder them in prison.\n\nYue He, a jailer in the prison, happens to be related to them, his sister being the wife of Sun Li, whose brother Sun Xin is married to Gu Dasao, a cousin of the Xies. Sun Li is the commandant of Dezhou's garrison. Yue takes the news of the Xies to Sun Xin and Gu Dasao. The couple rope in Zou Yuan and Zou Run to help in the rescue. They also pressure Sun Li to join in. On the day of rescue, Yue He opens the prison gate to let in Gu Dasao, who pretends to bring food to the Xies. After admitting her, Yue unlocks the manacles that shackle the Xies to a bed. Once released, the Xies are like tigers released, charging out of their cell and smashing the chief warden to death as Gu creates havoc in the jail compound.

The band reunited in 2018, twenty years after originally disbanding with a new single and EP.\n\nThe band was formed in Norway in 1989 by guitarist Tore Østby, singer Dag Østby, drummer Werner Skogli and bassist Freddy Samsonstuen. The following year, Arve Heimdal replaced Werner Skogli and Ingar Amlien replaced Freddy Samsonstuen, not long after the band recorded their first demo tape. A few months later, Dag Østby quit, and the band began auditioning new singers, eventually settling on Roy Khan, a classically trained opera singer from Elverum. During early concerts, Khan famously had to wear a wig because he did not feel comfortable with having the longer hair associated with the genre. The band also hired keyboard player Hans Gjestvang soon after, who was eventually replaced by Trond Nagell-Dahl in 1994.\n\nAfter failing to secure a record deal, the band formed their own label, CSF Records, and recorded their first album, \"The Last Sunset\", in a home studio.\n\nFollowing its 1991 release, however, the band was discovered and signed by German label Noise Records in 1993, where they recorded their second album \"Parallel Minds\", released the same year. The following year Noise also reissued their debut album. In 1995, the band released their third album, \"In Your Multitude\" and their fourth album, \"Flow\", in 1997.\n\nThe band was characterized by a unique sound in the power/progressive metal genre, notable for Østby's occasional integration of elements of flamenco (which he would continue in his later work with Ark) and Khan's unique, operatic vocals.\n\nConception disbanded in 1998, after Roy Khan was invited to join American symphonic power metal band Kamelot as their new lead singer. He went on to release several albums with the band, before departing in 2010 due to health issues, and retiring from music indefinitely. Østby devoted his focus to Ark, a progressive metal band he had formed in 1999 along with Jørn Lande and John Macaluso. They disbanded in 2002 and reunited from 2009 to 2011. Ingar Amlien formed the death metal band Crest of Darkness, who have released six studio albums as of 2018, and remain active. Drummer Arve Heimdal retired from music in 1999, making a one-off return for the band's 2005 reunion.\n\nConception reunited in 2005, playing the important American prog metal festival ProgPower USA on September 16 and Norwegian Scream Magazines 15 Years & 100 Issues Festival on October 1, bringing the final five-man line-up together again.\n\nIn April 2018, rumours began circulating that the band were planning a comeback, after reports of rehearsals in Gjøvik, followed by fan photos of the band together. Just a few days earlier, lead singer Roy Khan had posted a new track to his personal YouTube channel, his first known recording since 2010. This track, however, had no connection to Conception.\n\nA few weeks later, the band officially confirmed their reunion via their official Facebook site, and announced the recording of a brand new EP titled \"My Dark Symphony\" which was released on November 23, 2018. The reunion included the classic four-piece line-up, with Heimdal and Khan both coming out of retirement.\n\nOn February 20, 2020, the band announced their fifth studio album \"State of Deception\", which was released on April 3, 2020. The first single off of the album, \"Waywardly Broken\" was released on March 6, 2020, along with an accompanied lyric video.\n\nThe band had originally announced on July 1, 2019, that they would be embarking upon their first European headline tour in twenty-three years in April on the same year the new album was released. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band had postponed the tour into 2021. The band is set to perform an exclusive North American show at ProgPower USA XXI in September 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332464", "title": "High-κ dielectric", "text": "High-κ dielectric\n\nThe term high-κ dielectric refers to a material with a high dielectric constant (κ, kappa), as compared to silicon dioxide. High-κ dielectrics are used in semiconductor manufacturing processes where they are usually used to replace a silicon dioxide gate dielectric or another dielectric layer of a device. The implementation of high-κ gate dielectrics is one of several strategies developed to allow further miniaturization of microelectronic components, colloquially referred to as extending Moore's Law.\nSometimes, these materials are called \"high-k\" (spoken high kay), instead of \"high-κ\" (high kappa).\n\nSilicon dioxide (SiO) has been used as a gate oxide material for decades. As metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) have decreased in size, the thickness of the silicon dioxide gate dielectric has steadily decreased to increase the gate capacitance and thereby drive current, raising device performance. As the thickness scales below 2 nm, leakage currents due to tunneling increase drastically, leading to high power consumption and reduced device reliability. Replacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with a high-κ material allows increased gate capacitance without the associated leakage effects.\n\nThe gate oxide in a MOSFET can be modeled as a parallel plate capacitor. Ignoring quantum mechanical and depletion effects from the Si substrate and gate, the capacitance \"C\" of this parallel plate capacitor is given by\n\nWhere\n\n\nSince leakage limitation constrains further reduction of \"t\", an alternative method to increase gate capacitance is alter κ by replacing silicon dioxide with a high-κ material. In such a scenario, a thicker gate oxide layer might be used which can reduce the leakage current flowing through the structure as well as improving the gate dielectric reliability.\n\nThe drain current \"I\" for a MOSFET can be written (using the gradual channel approximation) as\n\nWhere\n\nThe term \"V − V\" is limited in range due to reliability and room temperature operation constraints, since a too large \"V\" would create an undesirable, high electric field across the oxide. Furthermore, \"V\" cannot easily be reduced below about 200 mV, because leakage currents due to increased oxide leakage (that is, assuming high-κ dielectrics are not available) and subthreshold conduction raise stand-by power consumption to unacceptable levels. (See the industry roadmap, which limits threshold to 200 mV, and Roy \"et al.\" ). Thus, according to this simplified list of factors, an increased \"I\" requires a reduction in the channel length or an increase in the gate dielectric capacitance.\n\nReplacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with another material adds complexity to the manufacturing process. Silicon dioxide can be formed by oxidizing the underlying silicon, ensuring a uniform, conformal oxide and high interface quality. As a consequence, development efforts have focused on finding a material with a requisitely high dielectric constant that can be easily integrated into a manufacturing process. Other key considerations include band alignment to silicon (which may alter leakage current), film morphology, thermal stability, maintenance of a high mobility of charge carriers in the channel and minimization of electrical defects in the film/interface. Materials which have received considerable attention are hafnium silicate, zirconium silicate, hafnium dioxide and zirconium dioxide, typically deposited using atomic layer deposition.\n\nIt is expected that defect states in the high-k dielectric can influence its electrical properties. Defect states can be measured for example by using zero-bias thermally stimulated current, zero-temperature-gradient zero-bias thermally stimulated current spectroscopy, or inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS).\n\nThe industry has employed oxynitride gate dielectrics since the 1990s, wherein a conventionally formed silicon oxide dielectric is infused with a small amount of nitrogen. The nitride content subtly raises the dielectric constant and is thought to offer other advantages, such as resistance against dopant diffusion through the gate dielectric.\n\nIn 2000, Gurtej Singh Sandhu and Trung T. Doan of Micron Technology initiated the development of atomic layer deposition high-k films for DRAM memory devices. This helped drive cost-effective implementation of semiconductor memory, starting with 90-nm node DRAM.\n\nIn early 2007, Intel announced the deployment of hafnium-based high-k dielectrics in conjunction with a metallic gate for components built on 45 nanometer technologies, and has shipped it in the 2007 processor series codenamed Penryn. At the same time, IBM announced plans to transition to high-k materials, also hafnium-based, for some products in 2008. While not identified, the most likely dielectric used in such applications are some form of nitrided hafnium silicates (HfSiON). HfO and HfSiO are susceptible to crystallization during dopant activation annealing. NEC Electronics has also announced the use of a HfSiON dielectric in their 55 nm \"UltimateLowPower\" technology. However, even HfSiON is susceptible to trap-related leakage currents, which tend to increase with stress over device lifetime. This leakage effect becomes more severe as hafnium concentration increases. There is no guarantee however, that hafnium will serve as a de facto basis for future high-k dielectrics. The 2006 ITRS roadmap predicted the implementation of high-k materials to be commonplace in the industry by 2010.\n\n\n"}

It also took a significant interest in the private lives of the characters.\n\nWhile many Crawford Productions police dramas combined videotaped interiors with location footage shot on 16mm film, \"Cop Shop\" was shot entirely on video, including external scenes.\n\nTwo one-hour episodes were broadcast each week and featured a specific police investigation and a guest cast whose stories formed a self-contained narrative block. Alongside this the ongoing narratives of the regular characters continued in longer, more open-ended soap opera-style story threads. This same soap opera-drama series hybrid format was also used in the series \"Skyways\", \"A Country Practice\" and \"Carson's Law\".\n\nAfter a run of seven years, the show completed taping its last episode on 22 December 1983 and the final episodes were screened in the first half of 1984.\n\nCop Shop won many awards including Logie Awards for most popular series and most popular actors, with Peter Adams and Paula Duncan winning multiple times.

The school was established by Phra Mongkut Klao Chaoyuhua - King Rama VI who is also known as King Vajiravudh. It was originally named the Royal Pages College (in Thai:Ma-had-lek-luang) then the king shifted Thai King College students to Royal Pages College and rename as Vajiravudh College. \nIn the college, the students are accommodated in houses (Ka-na) which are generally in primary and secondly education houses. The primary students stay in 3 houses called Sanamchan, Nandhauthayan and Saranrom. The secondary students are divided into 6 houses called School House, Dusit House, Chitlada House, Phyathai House, Chongruk-Bhakdi House and Saksri-Mongkol House. Overall, the college support students to balance sports and music or arts activities with academic education. \nNormally boys enter the school at Prathom 4 (Year 5) and stay on until they finish high school - Mathayom 6 (Year 13).\n\nThe royal policy of His Majesty King Rama VI, the founder, was\n\"\"In the Royal Pages Colleges, what I want is not so much to turn out model boys, all of the same Standard, all brilliant “Madhayom” Scholars with thousands of marks each, as to turn out efficient young men, _ young men who will be physically and morally clean, and who will be looking forward keenly to take up whatever burden the future may lay upon them. _I do not want monument of learning who have passed all your exams with flying colours. I do not want a walking school books. What I want are just manly young men, honest, truthful, clean in habit and thoughts; and I would not break my heart about it if you told me that such or such a fellow writes with difficulty, can't do compound fraction, or does not know any geometry, if I only knew that he has learnt enough at my school to know the difference between true manliness and effeminacy. I never want again to hear “clever” people complaining that \"ปัญญาท่วมหัวเอาตัวไม่รอด\". At the Mahadlek College, what I want is that Education should mean the turning of a boy into a fine young man and a good citizen, not to crush out all individuality under the weight of Syllabus and System!_ and I want Education to be interesting to the boys, so that they would in later days be able to look back upon School life as something peculiarly pleasant to have passed through. My College is not to be compared to other schools, where the aim is different. If I had wanted just the ordinary kind of school, I would have founded a day school, not a boarding one.\"\" \n\nThe College was founded on 29 December 1910 to provide education but also as \"reign monastery\". Normally, the King would build a temple as his reign monastery, but because as there were already many temples the King decided to build a school instead based on the system of Public School in England.\n\nIn establishing, His Majesty donated his wealth to build a temporarily wooden study building on his land at Suan Krajung near Khlong Prem Prachakon at Dusit district. Then moved in the Royal Pages's students which were temporarily located near Brahman ceremony hall in Royal Palace at 11 June 1911. Then later in 1915 His Majesty donated his wealth to build a permanent Royal Pages's study building, which were composed of an assembly hall and four houses at the four corners of the school. Then His Majesty set the first stone at 20 December 1915, then in 1916 Ratchavittayaluy from Ministry of Justice was moved onto his caring. His Majesty also established Chiang Mai Royal Pages College at Chiang Mai in 1917. Now the college in Chiang Mai is known as Yupparaj Royal's College.\n\nThe expanding of this school was stopped by the heavenly rest of Phra Mongkut Klao Chaoyuhua King Rama VI on 25 November 1925. In the next reign Siam (the name of Thailand at that time) was having economic problems, caused Phra Pokklao Chaoyuhua Rama VII to cut His Majesty's expenses. To keep the country's money in balance, His Majesty decided to close Royal Pages College and King's College (in Thai Ra-ja-vi-ta-ya-lai) and merge them all with Royal Pages College in Bangkok in 1926. Then His Majesty gave the school a new name, Vajiravudh College, in the honor of Phra Mongkut Klao Chaoyuhua King Rama VI or King Vajiravudh.\n\nVajiravudh College is a Leading Boarding School that would provide general education from primary to secondary level, including moral training in the style of British public schools. A board of directors was founded to manage the school, and this tradition continues to the present day.\n\nThe all-boys boarding is also exclusive for boys. Here, the school introduces more discipline something like military boarding style so that they can really change themselves to become responsible citizens in the future. The school provides students with high standards of academic instruction, opportunities for service to others, and a well-rounded program of activities directed toward the development of their skills, talents, and self-confidence for lifelong learning. Its facilities provide students with ample scope for supervised leisure and sport as well as studies. The school prepares students to become leaders in meeting the ever-changing needs of the world and equips them with the knowledge to face challenges in a cross-cultural environment.\n\nStudents normally stay in the school for 12 days and back to the parents for 2 days .There are 9 boarding houses in the school (Ka-na) and separated into senior and junior zone. There are 6 Senior houses that each house are accommodated about 80 students and equally divided for each grade from year 8 to year 13 and 3 Junior houses that are accommodated around 40 students from year 5 to year 7. Most of them were named after the royal palaces in Thailand, where King Rama VI used to stay in. Every boarding house has its own house color as a symbol.\n\nSenior Houses:\nThe regularity in senior houses mainly are arranged by prefects that given authorities by the Headmaster and Head of house. The system is described as \"good leadership come from good flower experiences\".\n\n\nJunior Houses:\nThe regularity in junior houses are different from senior houses that authorities are given to head of house and teachers.\n\n\nTime Schedule\n6.00 am Wake up and preparation for class\n7.00 – 7.50 am Study first period\n8.00 am Breakfast\n8.30 am Assemble and pray\n9.00 am Study from second period to sixth period\n13.30 am Lunch \n14.00-15.00 am Music or arts activities\n16.00-17.30 am Sports\n17.30 am Preparation for dinner\n18.15 am Dinner\n19.00 - 20.45 am PREP : Study and do homework\n20.45-21.00 am Preparation for bedtime\n21.00 am pray\n21.30 am Bedtime for junior students\n22.00 am Bedtime for senior students\n\nAll Vajiravudh students are required to do some kinds of sports every day from 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. according to the schedule. In each semester there are competitions between houses.\n\nFirst semester, Rainy season (Visakha), there are badminton and rugby competitions.\n\nSecond semester, Winter Season (Pavarana), there are basketball, football and swimming competitions.\n\nThird semester, Summer season (Makha), there are tennis, athletics, fives and squash competitions.\n\nThe school's main sport is rugby, which it is dominant in Thai's under-15, under-17 and under-19 rugby tournaments for years. The reason that rugby becomes school's main sport is that Phra Mongkut Klao Chaoyuhua King Rama VI thought that rugby would teach men sportsmanship, would teach them how to be a gentlemen as rugby is described from the English as \"Sport played in heaven\". A traditional friendly fixture against Malay College Kuala Kangsar of Malaysia is held annually since 1960.

Essentially it is an Under-17 boys of MCKK up against the Under-19 boys, over the years being conducted to be in favour of the school.\n\nEach time school hosts a traditional ceremony or going to a ceremony all students will have to dress the uniform given by King Vajiravudh. The purpose of King Vajiravudh for having the uniform is the students to dress\n\n1. White overcoat suit with covers for two upper pockets and two lower pockets on each sides. With five of silver Phra Mongut buttons.\n\n2. Dark blue velvet shirt collar with a one centimetre wide silver stripe.\n\n3. Dark blue shorts covering half of the knees.\n\n4. Dark blue triangle cap with two silver buttons.\n\n5. Long black socks reaching the knees, with black leather shoes.\n\nEach of the school's songs would be sung in important ceremony.\n\nMaha Vajiravudh Rajsadudee \"Praise the Great Vajiravudh\" written by Madam Dusadee Malakul na Ayuthaya, rhythm Chaloke Netre-suit. This song would be sung for praising the greatness of King Vajiravudh the school's founder.\n\nRao dek nai luang \"We Royal Page\" is a song written by King Vajiravudh. The words are to remind students the important of being royal page students. The song is sung in old Thai style melody, and played by Thai traditional musical instruments.\n\nEek see sip pe \"Forty Years On\" is the song adapted from the song Forty Years On of Harrow School. Changing its words to fit into the school by Madam Dusadee Malakul na Ayuthaya. The song is to remind the old boys and the current students about the life in school days.\n\nGraduates Song Goodbye is an English song words and melody by F.Rico. The song is sung by the graduating students, the song is to think about the student's future life after graduation. Jan ya nak kee la \"Sportsmanship\" is the song sung before each of the competitions between houses. The song is to remind the students of the sportsmanship. The rhythm of the song is in old Thai rhythm.\n\nBuildings in the school are mainly Thai style constructed e.g. Assembly hall, Clock Tower, Vajiramongkud (also called white building) and the houses. Phachatipok building is sciences and mathematics education building. Bejaratana building was the science center but now it use for language classes. The Kongbangkabkarn building is for computer science and foreign languages center; Vajiramongkud is for Thai language and social science; Vejsukamsatid is for arts. Suwattana is for music center and mathematic classes. Humanity and information resource center is for Recreation. There are new gymnasium and music buildings.\n\nHeadmaster is given the authority in the name of King to manage and lead the school accordingly to the royal policy.\n\n\nVajiravudh College has established the Global Collaboration and International Programs with over 20 schools from countries, including United States, England, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, India, and Singapore.\n\nThe variety international programs was developed, including an international school cooperation and academic exchange, foreign teacher employment, school joint cooperation, teaching staff going abroad and other international cooperation matters. Collaboration with other international schools benefits by increasing the opportunities available to students and teachers, as well as building strong foundations for dealing with academic collaboration and cultural exchange program. \n\nMessage from the head master, Dr. Saroj Leesavan, \"the 100th year anniversary of foundation of the school is held from 29 December 2010. Since the school was named as ‘Royal Pages College’ that was the beginning of the Royal policy and the modern education system from the King Rama VI that will lead the country to better development. The education create a ‘young gentlemen who will be physically and morally clean’ who will help country and society. After 100 of years, the direction from the King still stay in the student's heart and many graduated students are admitted and respected to work in important role especially working in the name of the King Rama IX which maintain the purpose of the school.\"\n\n"}

Storage Resource Managers (SRMs) address such issues by coordinating storage allocation, streaming the data between sites, and enforcing secure interfaces to the storage systems (i.e. dealing with special security requirements of each storage system at its home institution.) For example, in a production environment, using SRMs has reduced error rates of large-scale replication from 1% to 0.02% in the STAR project. Furthermore, SRMs can prevent job failures. When running jobs on clusters some of the local disks get filled before the job finishes, resulting in loss of productivity, and therefore a delay in analysis. This occurs because space was not dynamically allocated and previous unneeded files were not removed. While there are tools for dynamically allocating compute and network resources, SRMs are the only tool available for providing dynamic space reservation, guaranteeing secure file availability with lifetime support, and automatic garbage collection that prevents clogging of storage systems.\n\nThe SRM specification has evolved into an international de facto standard, and many projects have committed to use this technology, especially in the HEP and HENP communities, such as the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Computing Grid (WLCG) that supports ATLAS and CMS.\nThe SRM approach is to develop a uniform standard interface that allows multiple implementations by various institutions to interoperate. This approach removes the dependence on a single implementation, and permits multiple groups to develop SRM systems for their specific storage resources. This approach became crucial to the interoperation of storage systems for such large scale projects that have to manage and distribute massive amounts of data efficiently and securely. Without such a unifying technology, such projects cannot scale, and are bound to fail. This problem will only grow over time as computing facilities move into the petascale regime.\n\nAnother important problem that SRMs address is storage clogging. Storage clogging is a critical problem for large scale shared storage systems, since the removal of files after they are used is not automated. This increases the cost of storage, and slows the analysis and discovery process. SRMs help unclog temporary storage systems, by providing lifetime management of accessed files. This capability is crucial to efficient usage of storage under cost constraints.\n\nSRMs also serve as gateways to secure data access. By limiting external access to all storage systems through a standard SRM interface, one can assure not only authenticated access, but also the enforcement of authorized access to files.\nThe SRM technology was highly successful in SciDAC-1, and is currently used in production in several large collaborations. SRM implementations that interoperate have been developed at LBNL, FNAL and TJNAF, as well as several sites in Europe. Furthermore, this technology increases the scientist’s productivity by eliminating the tedious and time consuming tasks of managing storage, performing robust data movement, and dealing with security requirements at various storage sites.\n\nIn addition to leading the SRM standard development by coordinating with multiple institutions, the LBNL team has developed SRM systems to disk storage and mass storage systems, including HPSS. These SRMs have been used in several application domains, including multiple projects at the SDM center, Earth System Grid, the STAR experiment, and the Open Science Grid (OSG). As data sets continue to grow and become ever more complex, these projects depend on the continued development and support of the SRM implementations from LBNL. It is essential to capitalize on the SciDAC-1 successes and sustain current projects that depend on the SRM technology, further improving and deploying SRMs in additional projects and application domains, and continued evolution of the SRM standard. Specifically, based on past experience, we have identified important features that require further development and coordination. These include sophisticated aspects of resource monitoring that can be used for performance estimation, authorization enforcement, and accounting tracking and reporting for the purpose of enforcing quota usage in SRMs. Another aspect that needs further development is SRMs for multi-component storage systems. Such systems, made of a combination of multiple disk arrays, parallel file systems, and archival storage are becoming more prevalent as the volume of data that need to be managed grow exponentially with petascale computing.\n\nThe SRM interfaces have been cooperatively defined and multiple implementations developed in the US and Europe. LBNL has introduced the concepts and subsequently led a coordinated effort of defining a community-based common interface. Several implementations have been deployed in various applications including HEP, HENP, ESG as well as new application domains, such as Fusion simulation, biology, and others. Some specifics of SRM usage to date are:\n\n\nList of Storage Resource Manager software:\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Sick Guan Suo\", he ranks 32nd among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nGood-looking with thick eyebrows, eyes like those of a fenghuang and a sparse beard on his chin, Yang Xiong, whose body is covered with tattoes of flowers, resembles Guan Suo but has a pale complexion. He is thus nicknamed \"Sick Guan Suo\". Guan Suo is a character in Chinese folklore said to be the son of Guan Yu of the Three Kingdoms era and imaged to look like his father. A skilled fighter from Henan, Yang Xiong works as a chief prison warden and executioner in Jizhou (薊州; present-day Ji County, Tianjin).\n\nOne day, after beheading a criminal, Yang Xiong is showered with gifts from grateful onlookers as he makes his way back to his office through a busy street. A group of hooligans intent on snatching away the gifts suddenly spring on and restrain him, catching him off-guard. Shi Xiu, who is stranded in Jizhou and happens to come by carrying firewood which he sells for a living, rushes to his aid. The two together drive away the thugs. Yang is grateful to Shi Xiu and requests they become sworn brothers.\n\nYang Xiong invites Shi Xiu to live with him and sets up a meat shop for him to run. Shi Xiu is sharp-eyed and soon detects that Yang's wife Pan Qiaoyun is having a secret affair with the monk Pei Ruhai. He informs Yang Xiong about it. However, Yang goes to dine with his colleagues after the tip-off and in a drunken state chastises his wife for being unchaste when he gets home. He forgets the scolding the next day, which allows the woman to turn the table on Shi Xiu before Yang questions her. She lies that she has rejected Shi's advances, inducing Yang to conclude that Shi has bad-mouthed her so as to save himself. Believing his wife, Yang signals to Shi that their ties are severed by closing the meat shop. Knowing he has been maligned, Shi is determined to clear his name.\n\nOne night, Shi Xiu ambushes and kills Pei Ruhai in a deserted lane outside Yang Xiong's house when the monk is leaving it after a tryst with Pan. He then takes the monk's robe and other personal effects to show to Yang Xiong. Now quite convinced by Shi, Yang Xiong lures Pan Qiaoyun to Mount Cuiping (翠屏山; in present-day Jizhou, Hebei) under the pretext of visiting his ancestors' graves. On the hill, he and Shi Xiu confront her and demand she tells the truth. Scared, Pan admits her wrongdoings. Instigated by Shi, Yang kills her as well as her maid, who has acted as a lookout in the adultery.\n\nYang Xiong and Shi Xiu decide to seek refuge at the outlaw stronghold of Liangshan Marsh. They are joined by Shi Qian, who has chanced upon the killings while stealing from graves at Mount Cuiping. Along the way, they rest in an inn owned by the Zhu Family Manor. Shi Qian steals the inn's only rooster to cook for meal as the place has nothing nice to offer, sparking off a fight between the three and the innkeeper. Shi Xiu burns down the inn as the innkeeper fetches men to seize them. Shi Qian is caught in a trap as they flee. Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu stumble into the neighbouring Li Family Manor, where they run into Du Xing, who has once received help from Yang in Jizhou. Du takes them to his master Li Ying, who agrees to help them get Shi Qian freed. Li submits the request in two consecutive letters to the Zhu Family Manor, but the Zhus refuse both times. When Li Ying goes to confront them, he is injured by an arrow. Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu then proceed to Liangshan, their only hope to save Shi Qian. After three offensives, Liangshan overruns the Zhu Family Manor and releases Shi Qian.\n\nYang Xiong is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. \n\nHe survives the run of campaigns but dies from a tumour on his back when returning to the imperial capital Dongjing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332535", "title": "Forced suicide", "text": "Forced suicide\n\nForced suicide is a method of execution where the victim is coerced into committing suicide to avoid facing an alternative option they perceive as much worse, such as suffering torture or having friends or family members imprisoned, tortured, or killed. Another common form historically has been deliberately providing a condemned individual with a weapon and a brief period in which to commit honourable suicide if he or she chooses before being executed.\n\nForced suicide was a common means of execution in ancient Greece and Rome. As a mark of respect it was generally reserved for aristocrats sentenced to death; the victims would either drink hemlock or fall on their swords. Economic motivations prompted some suicides in ancient Rome. A person who was condemned to death would forfeit property to the government. People could evade that provision and let the property pass to their heirs by committing suicide prior to arrest.\n\nThe most well-known forced suicide is that of the philosopher Socrates, who drank hemlock after his trial for allegedly corrupting the youth of Athens. The Stoic philosopher Seneca also killed himself in response to an order by his pupil, the Roman Emperor Nero, who himself was forced to commit suicide at a later date. Other famous forced suicides include those of Brutus, Mark Antony, Emperor Otho, and the Roman General Corbulo.\n\nThe Hindu practice of sati, in which a recently widowed woman would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre, is not generally considered a type of honor killing. However, the extent up to which Sati was a purely voluntary act or one that was coerced is actively debated. There have been some incidents in recent times, such as the Roop Kanwar case, in which forced sati was suspected. Additional cases are under investigation, though no evidence of forced suicide has yet been found.\n\nJapanese seppuku falls into this category. The culture practiced by the samurai expected them to ritually kill themselves if found disloyal, sparing a \"daimyō\" or \"shōgun\" the indignity of executing a follower. This was especially the case in the Edo period, and Asano Naganori was a clear example.\n\nA forced suicide may be a substitute for an honour killing when a woman violates the \"namus\" in conservative Middle Eastern societies. In 2006, the United Nations investigated reports of forced suicides of women in southeastern Turkey.\n"}

{"id": "2332542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332542", "title": "School District of Philadelphia", "text": "School District of Philadelphia\n\nThe School District of Philadelphia (SDP) is the school district that includes all public schools in Philadelphia. Established in 1818, it is the 8th largest school district in the nation, by enrollment, serving over 200,000 students.\n\nThe school board was created in 1850 to oversee the schools of Philadelphia. The Act of Assembly of April 5, 1867, designated that the Controllers of the Public Schools of Philadelphia were to be appointed by the judges of the Court of Common Pleas. There was one Controller to be appointed from each ward. This was done to eliminate politics from the management of the schools.\n\nEventually, the management of the school district was given to a school board appointed by the mayor. This continued until 2001 when the district was taken over by the state, and the governor was given the power to appoint a majority of the five members of the new School Reform Commission. In July 2018, the School Reform Commission (SRC) was disbanded and control of the district was returned to the city and its newly selected Philadelphia School Board.\n\nThe School District of Philadelphia operates 214 of the city's 300 public schools, including 149 elementary schools, 16 middle schools, and 49 high schools.\n\nThe remaining 86 public schools are independently operated charter schools. Charter schools are authorized by the School District of Philadelphia, and are accountable to it.\n\nEnrollment in Philadelphia's district schools was 203,225 students as of September 2019.\n\nAs of the 2014–2015 school year, there were 107 languages other than English spoken at home by district students. The largest group of students with families using languages other than English at home was the Spanish speakers, with 6,260 students, making up 52% of the school district's other than English at home population. The other languages, in descending order, were Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Vietnamese, Khmer, various English and French-based Creoles and Pidgins, Russian, French, Portuguese, Nepali, Cantonese Chinese, Pashto, Malayalam, Ukrainian, Albanian, Bengali, and 82 other languages.\n\nEnrollment in the city's charter schools was 60,774 students (December 2013).\n\n 66% of all students of the School District of Philadelphia were black; this number was proportionally high since whites of all economic backgrounds had a tendency to use private schools, with wealthier whites using elite private schools and lower income whites using Catholic schools. Wealthier blacks chose not to use private schools because their neighborhoods were assigned to higher quality public schools.\n\nPrior to August 2012, the district was organized into academic division (AD) offices, each with its own Assistant Superintendent. As a part of the Chief Academic Office Reorganization/Transition Proposal, the AD structure was abolished. Schools are organized into Principal Learning Teams (PLTs), each with its own peer-selected Coordinator and all schools now report to the Chief Academic Office through the Office of School Performance Management.\n\nThe School District of Philadelphia is governed by a nine-member Board of Education. All members are appointed by the Mayor of Philadelphia and approved by Philadelphia City Council. The Board of Education was re-established in July 2018 after seventeen years of governance by a School Reform Commission.<br>\n\nLeadership<br>\nThe following is the current district leadership.\n\nBoard of Education\n\nIn 1967, high school students demonstrated in front of the Board of Education building, demanding better treatment, especially for African-American students, and better funding. The demonstrators were met with force by the Philadelphia Police Department, and the resulting riot left 22 injured and 57 arrested.\n\nThe state takeover of the district had its roots in the chronic low test scores of district students and a history of inequitable financing which left the district with substantial and perpetual deficits. In 1975, Pennsylvania provided 55 percent of school funding statewide; in 2001 it provided less than 36 percent. An analysis determined that increased district spending was limited by a state system which relies heavily on property taxes for local school funding. As a result, wealthier school districts with proportionately more property owners and more expensive real estate have more funds for schools. The result is great disparities in school system expenditures per student. In 2000, the Philadelphia school district spent $6,969 a year per student. Seventy percent of Philadelphia's students are at or near the poverty line. This contrasts with expenditures per student in wealthier suburban school districts: Jenkintown, $12,076; Radnor, $13,288; and Upper Merion, $13,139.\n\nIn February 1998, then-superintendent David Hornbeck threatened to close the city's schools if the state did not provide the funds needed to balance his proposed budget.\n\nState lawmakers responded to the threat with fast-moving legislation, Act 46, on April 21, approving a school funding package that included a takeover plan. The legislature's plan was a reaction to Hornbeck's threatening to shut down the schools because of a financial crisis.\n\"Holding students and their parents and teachers hostage in an effort to gain additional funding is certainly bold but not very wise\", commented Representative Dwight Evans, Democratic chair of the House Appropriations Committee and prime architect of the takeover bill.\n\nTwo lawsuits were filed by the city and the Philadelphia School District in 1997 and 1998 to address what they considered inadequate funding levels. The first, filed by the school district, the city and community leaders, contended that Pennsylvania did not provide a \"thorough and efficient\" education; it was dismissed outright by the state court. The second case, a civil rights suit filed in Federal District Court, by the district, the city, and other interested parties, contended that the state's funding practices discriminated against school districts with large numbers of non-White students; the School District of Philadelphia was a key complainant in this case. The city agreed to put this case on hold when Mayor Street negotiated the \"friendly\" state takeover of the district, with the promise of additional funding from the state.\n\nIn June 2000, under increasing pressure to find a solution to the fiscal and academic problems facing the district, school superintendent David W. Hornbeck ended his six-year tenure. Hornbeck said he did not have the financial support of state and city officials to continue his school reform program (and a year later launched a statewide advocacy organization, Good Schools Pennsylvania, to mobilize citizens in support of improved state funding for public education). He called improving public education \"one of the great civil rights battles of this generation.\"\nThe Board of Education then implemented a new management structure, replacing the superintendent's position with two new positions, a chief academic officer, Deidre Fambry, and a chief executive officer.\n\nIn 2001, the district had a projected deficit of $216.7 million in its current $1.7 billion budget. There was a crisis in making the school payroll and paying $30 million in vendor bills. In recognition of the assistance, Mayor Street agreed to postpone for three months a 1998 federal lawsuit brought by the city claiming racial discrimination in the way the state funds the Philadelphia school district. In a study released in July by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, Pennsylvania was ranked as having the sixth most segregated schools in the United States. Under the legislation enacted in 1998, in 2001 Governor Mark Schweiker took control of the schools. The state takeover of what was then the fifth largest school district in the United States was seen as the most radical reform ever undertaken in a large urban school district. This move was opposed by Mayor John F. Street and many members of the city of Philadelphia. The negotiations dragged on because of the state's insistence that the city pay its fair share, while the city fought to retain some control over the governance. Also at stake was the control of patronage jobs controlled by the mayor in the district's central administration.\n\nIn the end, the city put up an additional $45 million for the schools instead of the $15 million initially offered and the state provided an additional $75 million. In return, the mayor gets to appoint two commission members rather than just one under the governor's initial plan.\n\nThe schools were clearly failing, but the state and the city could not agree on reform and local governance issues. As negotiation continued, a coalition of labor unions and community groups called the \"Coalition to Keep Our Public Schools Public\", filed a lawsuit to stop the state from signing a contract for Edison Schools to manage city schools. The state backed off on a hostile takeover and negotiated with the city. One of the chief concerns was the complete privatization of the school district.\n\nThe reform plan was opposed by the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers. Protestors like J. Whyatt Mondesire of the NAACP vowed \"... to shut down the streets\", in protest. Members of the NAACP and a group of black ministers blocked an intersection in front of City Hall during rush-hour traffic. The day before, several hundred students walked out of classes. And earlier a crowd consisting mostly of unionized district employees marched on City Hall, where they disrupted the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony and drowned out the choir with their chants.\n\nOn December 21, 2001, Secretary Charles Zogby of the Pennsylvania Department of Education signed a \"Declaration of Distress\" for the district. This triggered the state takeover of the school district from the City of Philadelphia. The state of Pennsylvania formed the \"School Reform Commission\" to oversee the troubled public school system.\n\nThis action was the end result of a months long negotiation under the legislation enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in April 1998. The takeover plan had six main elements: putting the district under the control of a School Reform Commission; hire a CEO; enable the CEO to reform the teaching staff by hiring non-certified staff, reconstitute troubled schools by reassigning or firing staff; allow the commission to hire for-profit firms to manage some schools; convert some schools to charter schools; and reallocate and redistribute school district resources.\n\nAt the time of the takeover, it was expected that Edison Schools, Inc. would be one of the prime beneficiaries of the partial privatization. It had been involved in developing the plan for privatization commissioned by then governor Tom Ridge. Edison was not given as many schools as it had hoped, primarily because of conflict of interest concerns Youth organizers from the Philadelphia Student Union staged protests, and engaged in civil disobedience to prevent the School District from handing over control of the central administration to Edison. Youth leaders were ultimately successful in preventing a takeover of the central office, and also prevented the take-over of any high schools by for-profit companies. As of 2007 the company had not delivered the promised improvements.\n\nAfter the state takeover, the district adopted what is known as the \"diverse provider\" model, turning over the management of some of the lowest-achieving schools to for-profit and nonprofit organizations and two local universities and providing additional resources to the private managers.\nThe most controversial of the 2001 reforms the partnership program saw \"educational management organizations\" (EMOs) Edison Schools, Foundations Inc., Victory Schools, Universal Companies, Temple University, and University of Pennsylvania brought in to manage some of the district's lowest-performing schools.\n\nTo date, the schools managed by private providers were doing neither better nor worse than district-wide achievement trends. District-managed schools given additional resources but no specific intervention were likewise doing about as well as other schools in the district. In contrast, district-managed schools given additional resources and a \"restructuring\" intervention showed larger achievement gains in mathematics.\n\nIn June 2013 the school district cut over three thousand employees. Two thousand and two of them were aides that ensured the safety of the students during the school day. This budget cut angered parents, students, and employees. Governor Corbett had until the end of the month to approve the budget, so many took to protesting outside his office. UNITE HERE, the union which represented the laid off workers, helped organize a hunger strike. On June 17 two parents and two cafeteria workers began a hunger strike and the protest was named \"Fast for Safe Schools\". The protesters received a lot of support from the community as well as politicians. On June 28 fifteen politicians fasted for twenty-four hours to show their support. On the same day members of the community delivered a petition with more than one thousand signatures to Governor Corbett. Governor Corbett did finally add $140 million to the budget even though it was less than what was requested by the community. The community celebrated this victory that they achieved through nonviolent protest. However, by the time school was starting in August, the safety staff had not been hired back. On August 14 over one hundred community members resumed the hunger strike for a twenty four-hour period. As a result, most of the staff was rehired.\n\nBeginning in 2001 the district required all schools to enact school uniforms or strict dress codes. Some schools had already adopted uniforms prior to 2001.\n\nThe Philadelphia School District rates and categorizes schools based on performance. Vanguard schools are considered the leading performing schools within the district and require a special admission process for students. Non-vanguard schools that make adequate yearly progress are considered traditional district schools. Empowerment schools are schools that are struggling. Traditionally, failing schools are privatized and are called renaissance schools.\n\nUnder the strategic plan, the district allows principals to hire teachers and staffs and create incentives for high performing teachers and schools, such as tenure. The district also created tracking tools, performance indicators, to gauge the progress of schools and how schools affect student achievement. The district increased the staffs and accessibility of its call centers to provide services and allow parents and community to report directly to the headquarters..\n\nThe district's many parent and community engagement policies are combined in a central office called the Office of Parent Family, Community, Engagement, and Faith-Based Partnerships. Between 2004 and 2009, outside funding for parent engagement was provided by the William Penn Foundation for the Parent Leadership Academy (PLA) and The PA Department of Education for the Parent Volunteers Program (PVP). The district has implemented various different programs to engage families in the education of their children. In collaboration with the PA Parent Information Resource Center (PIRC), the district designated October as Parent Appreciation Month beginning in 2006. Parent Appreciation Month activities included Parent Appreciation Day, Superintendent's Closet Fashion Shows, Take a Parent to Work Day and Superintendent's Home Visits. Parent Assistance Desks (PADs) offered a way for parents to feel welcomed upon entering schools by having a parent from the community sit in an office or at a desk at the front door to provide needed resources and information. The Title I Parents 'R' Equal Partners (PREP) Program helped PREPare parents for effective partnerships with principals and administrators by conducting monthly workshops and trainings. In 2009, The Superintendent's Roundtable discussions were held to hear (firsthand) from many parents who felt that their children were not receiving the quality education they deserved. In 2010, School Advisory Councils (SACs) were modeled after the PA Governor's Institute of Parental Involvement to invite parents, family and community members to share decision-making with school-based staff.\n\nThe Parent University of Philadelphia, offered a variety of free courses to parents, such as basic computer skills, lessons on legal rights of parents, English as a second language, and other evidence-based knowledge and skills enhancement courses. Parent University was funded heavily by Federal Stimulus grant. The district also set up citywide resource centers where parents can get resources seek help from the district on issues that could not be resolved at the school, such as bullying problems or complaints. The number of Parent Ombudsmen, school based staff who works directly with parent, were increased to serve 173 schools. Many of the programs have received local and national attentions for pioneering the field of parent engagement.\n\nThe school district has an art collection that contains about 1,125 paintings, photos, sculptures and other pieces that are displayed in schools or are stored in an undisclosed facility. The estimated worth was $30 million in 2003, but district spokesperson Fernando Gallard estimates the collection is worth $2 million in 2013. Much of this art disappeared when Paul Vallas was Superintendent of the Philadelphia School District.\n\nPennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the School Reform Commission for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the School Reform Commission (school board) no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The Commission must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.\n\nIn 2013, the average teacher salary in Philadelphia School District was $70,789.54 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $29,120.55 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $99,910.10.

The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007–08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. According to PSBA, the median superintendent salary rose to over $130,000 in 2011.\n\nIn 2010, the district's per-pupil spending had increased to $14,132.04, ranking 192 of PA's 500 public school districts for per-pupil spending. In 2011, Pennsylvania's per-pupil spending was $13,467, ranking 6th in the United States. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was reported as $12,759.\n\nAccording to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Philadelphia School District receives 48.8% of its annual revenue from the state.\n\nFor the 2014–15 school year, Philadelphia School District will receive $984,000,794 in State Basic Education funding (BEF). The district will also receive $21,639,578 in Accountability Block Grant funding and $12,101,631 in new Ready To Learn Block grant. When coupled with various other state funding like Social Security payment reimbursements, Special Education funding, transportation funding, and various state grants, the district will receive a total of $1,328,105,855 in state funding. The State's enacted Education Budget includes $5,526,129,000 for the 2014–2015 Basic Education Funding. The Education budget also includes Accountability Block Grant funding at $100 million and $241 million in new Ready to Learn funding for public schools that focus on student achievement and academic success. The State is paying $500.8 million to Social Security on the school employees behalf and another $1.16 billion to the state teachers pension system (PSERS). In total, Pennsylvania's Education budget for K-12 public schools is $10 billion. This was a $305 million increase over 2013–2014 state spending and the greatest amount ever allotted by the Commonwealth for its public schools.\n\nIn the 2013–2014 school year, Philadelphia School District received a 1.6% increase or $983,928,923 in State Basic Education Funding. This is $15,793,043 more than its 2012–2013 state BEF to the district. Additionally, Philadelphia School District received $21,639,578 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement and level funding for special education services. The district has the option of applying for several other state and federal grants to increase revenues. The Commonwealth's budget increased Basic Education Funding statewide by $123 million to over $5.5 billion. Most of Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts received an increase of Basic Education Funding in a range of 0.9% to 4%. Eight public school districts received exceptionally high funding increases of 10% to 16%. The highest increase in state funding was awarded to Austin Area School District which received a 22.5% increase in Basic Education Funding. The highest percent of state spending per student is in the Chester-Upland School District, where roughly 78 percent comes from state coffers. In Philadelphia, it is nearly 49 percent. As a part of the education budget, the state provided the PSERS (Pennsylvania school employee pension fund) with $1,017,000,000 and Social Security payments for school employees of $495 million.\n\nFor the 2012–13 school year, Philadelphia School District received $968,135,880 in BEF. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012–2013 included $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which was an increase of $49 million over the 2011–12 budget. In addition to BEF dollars, the Commonwealth provided $100 million for the Accountability Block Grant (ABG) program. Philadelphia School District received $21,639,578 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The state also provided a $544.4 million payment for School Employees’ Social Security and $856 million for School Employees’ Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount was a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011–2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010–11 school year.\n\nIn the 2011–2012 school year, Philadelphia School District received a $968,133,666 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, Philadelphia School District received $21,639,581 in Accountability Block Grant funding and $43,382,470 in Social Security payment reimbursement. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011–2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount was a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010–2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District of Allegheny County, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011–12. In 2010, the district reported that 125,332 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. Some public school districts experienced a reduction in funding due to the loss of federal stimulus funding which ended in 2011.\n\nIn the 2010–2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 6.35% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $1,075,020,639 to the Philadelphia School District. This was a $64,189,949 increase over 2009–2010 BEF. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase for the 2010–2011 School year, went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County, which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. Fifteen (15) Pennsylvania public school districts received a BEF increase of greater than 10%. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even when enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some public school districts at a far greater rate than others. This was the final state education budget negotiated by the Rendell Administration.\n\nIn the 2009–10 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided an 8.39% increase in state Basic Education Funding for a total of $1,010,830,689. This was a $78,225,094 increase over 2008–2009 BEF. Ninety (90) Pennsylvania public school districts received the base 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each public school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal.\n\nIn 2008–2009 school year, the state Basic Education Funding to the Philadelphia School District was $932,606,246. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 136,938 district students received free or reduced- price lunches due to low family income in the 2007–2008 school year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000. This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.\n\nAll Pennsylvania school districts also receive additional funding from the state through several other funding allocations, including Reimbursement of Charter School Expenditures; Special Education Funding; Secondary Career & Technical Education Subsidy; PA Accountability Grants – $47,495 to Camp Hill in 2010; and Educational Assistance Program Funding. Plus all Pennsylvania school districts receive federal dollars for various programs including Special Education and Title I funding for children from low income families. In 2010, Pennsylvania spent over $24 billion for public education – local, state and federal dollars combined.\n\nBeginning in 2004–2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $2 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher skills training; All Day Kindergarten; lower class size in Kindergarten through 3rd grade; literacy and math coaching programs (provides teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction); before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010–11, the district applied for and received $58,735,223 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide Full Day kindergarten and preschool funding. In 2009, 100% of the kindergarteners in the Philadelphia School District attended full-day kindergarten.\n\nBeginning in the 2014–2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for: school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs.\n\nPhiladelphia School District will receive $12,101,631 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, Special Education funding, Accountability Block Grant funding, PreK Counts funding, reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees and other state grants which the district must apply to receive.\n\nPhiladelphia School District receives state funding to provide taxpayer-funded preschool at the elementary schools. For the 2013–14 school year, Philadelphia School District received a Pre K Counts grant of $19,900,120. For the 2011 school year, Philadelphia School District was a high priority for funding due to the high poverty level of children in the district's attendance area. In 2011 the district received $20,512,350 in PreK Count grant funding to fund 2,406 children attending prechool. Enrollment for Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts is targeted to children living in families earning up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nFor 2014, the state's PreK Counts program received a $10 million increase to $97,284,000. In 2013, the state's PreK Counts program received $87,284,000. In 2010, the PreK Counts program received $83.6 million statewide in Governor Corbett's education budget. In 2007–08 the state funded Pre-K Counts at $75 million. Philadelphia School District received funding in 2007–08. In 2009–10, the Philadelphia School District received $20,512,350 to provide preschool to 2,406 children.\n\nIn addition to PreK Counts funding, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also supplements the federal Head Start preschool program with an additional funding on an annual basis. In 2014–2015 this will be $39,178,000. The program is available to low-income children residing within the district through private providers. In 2013, Pennsylvania contributed $39,178,000 to Head Start. In 2010, Head Start received $37.6 million in Pennsylvania state education dollars. Since 2003, Pennsylvania has more than doubled the number of preschoolers in publicly funded pre-kindergarten through a multipronged system including: school-based pre-kindergarten, Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts through private providers, Early Intervention, Head Start and Head Start Supplemental, and the school district's use of Accountability Block Grants. Over 100,000 Pennsylvania preschoolers participate in state taxpayer funded pre-kindergarten programs. In 2013, the federal government spends $8 billion for preschool programs nationwide. In 2013, Pennsylvania was awarded a $51.7 million federal grant to fund early learning programs. The funding will be used to create 50 Early Childhood Education Community Innovation Zones in areas where the lowest-performing public schools, including charter schools, exist. The federal dollars will not be used to provide seats for children in preschools. Instead the money will be used to build bureaucracy and added training for teachers/providers.\n\nThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The School District received $886,699 in 2006–07. In 2007–08, Philadelphia School District received an additional $1,688,149. The district received $6,834,225 in 2008–09. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District – $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009–10 state budget.\n\nAndrew Hamilton Elementary School and Overbrook Elementary School successfully applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008–09. For the 2008–09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools statewide reaching 66,973 students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program was a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills. To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training. The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. The school district administration was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006–07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated for the program. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008–09 budget. The grant was discontinued in the state's 2011 budget by Governor Edward G. Rendell.\n\nThe Philadelphia School District did not participate in: 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant or 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants.\n\nThe Philadelphia District received an extra $587,979,707 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) – Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.\n\nDistrict officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided tens of millions of additional federal dollars, to improve student academic achievement. due to the low academic outcomes in the district they were eligible for an additional $750 per child. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of other PA public school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.\n\nIn July 2003, Philadelphia School District received a federal grant which is run by the PDE. The grant calls for the establishment and sustainability of community learning centers that provide additional educational services to students in high-poverty and low-performing schools. The grant was competitive. Applications for the grants were reviewed and scored by a panel of representatives from the educational field and professional grant writers. The district received $2 million in 2003. The School District was also funded from 2010 to 2013. The district received the highest funding available: $750,000 (2010), $500,000 (2011), and $500,000 (2012) While 101 entities applied for the funding, only 66 were approved including eight charter schools.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332545", "title": "WALB", "text": "WALB\n\nWALB, virtual and VHF digital channel 10, is a dual NBC/ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Albany, Georgia, United States and serving Southwestern Georgia. Owned by Gray Television, it is sister to low-powered CW+ affiliate WGCW-LD, channel 36 (which WALB simulcasts on its fourth digital subchannel). The two stations share studios on Stuart Avenue in Albany; WALB's transmitter is located east of Doerun, along the Colquitt–Worth county line.\n\nThe station signed on the air on April 7, 1954, and was owned by Gray Communications (now Gray Television) along with WALB radio (1590 AM) and \"The Albany Herald\". It is one of only two full-power stations to have been built and signed on by the company, the other being WCAV-TV in Charlottesville, Virginia. When the radio station's studios were built back in 1953, Stuart Avenue was a dirt road running through a pecan grove. For its first three years on-air, WALB-TV transmitted an analog signal on VHF channel 10 from a tower at its studios. As the first television outlet in Albany, it was a primary NBC affiliate with secondary relations with ABC and DuMont.\n\nThe latter network was dropped in 1955 when it shut down and ABC remained on WALB until 1980 when WVGA (now WSWG) started up in Valdosta. The station moved to a tower near Doerun was built in 1957. The radio station was sold in 1960 to Allen Woodall, Sr. and became known as WALG to distinguish itself from the television station. In March 1976, a fire destroyed WALB's main broadcasting facilities but did not damage its offices.\n\nWALB was a major beneficiary of a quirk in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s plan for allocating stations. In the early days of broadcast television, there were twelve VHF channels available and 69 UHF channels (later reduced to 55 in 1983). The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced.\n\nAfter the FCC's \"Sixth Report and Order\" ended the license freeze and opened the UHF band in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses. Under this plan, almost all of the country would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one noncommercial channel. Most of the rest of the country (\"1/2\") would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas would be designated as \"UHF islands\" since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The \"2\" networks became CBS and NBC, \"+1\" represented non-commercial educational stations, and \"1/2\" became ABC (which was the weakest network usually winding up with the UHF allocation where no VHF was available).\n\nHowever, Albany is sandwiched between Dothan (channels 2 and 4) to the west, Columbus (channels 3, 7, and 9) and Macon (channel 13) to the north, Tallahassee (channels 6 and 11) to the south, and Savannah (channels 3, 9, and 11) and Jacksonville/Brunswick (channels 4, 7, and 12) to the east. This created a large \"doughnut\" in southwestern Georgia where there could only be \"one\" VHF license. Although there were no stations on channels 5 or 8 in the immediate area, channel 5 was occupied in Atlanta and Gainesville while channel 8 was allocated to Waycross (which is part of the Jacksonville market); these cities are too close to Albany to reallocate. As a result, WALB remained the only television station in Southwest Georgia until WXGA-TV began broadcasting from Waycross in 1961 (although that station serves the Jacksonville area).\n\nUntil 1983, WALB was the default NBC affiliate for Tallahassee. Although WTWC-TV has been that area's affiliate since then, WALB still provides city-grade coverage to almost all of the Georgia side of the Tallahassee market and Grade B coverage to the city itself. WALB dropped the -TV suffix to its call sign in 1993, even though channel 10 and its radio sister had gone their separate ways three decades earlier. As a result of flash flooding caused by Tropical Storm Alberto, WALB stayed on-the-air with non-stop 24-hour coverage to alert citizens and provide a vital link between the public and government agencies.\n\nIn 1996, Gray bought WCTV in Tallahassee. The Federal Communications Commission told Gray that it could not keep both WCTV and WALB due to channel 10's aforementioned coverage in Tallahassee; indeed, WCTV had long claimed Albany as part of its secondary coverage area. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of two stations with large signal overlaps, and would not even consider a waiver for a city-grade overlap. As a result, Gray sold WALB to Cosmos Broadcasting, the broadcasting division of Liberty Corporation, in 1998.\n\nLiberty sold off its insurance business in 2000, and Cosmos came directly under the Liberty banner. However, Gray continued to maintain its Albany administrative offices (located in the \"Albany Herald\" building), until 2015. It returned to its hometown in WSWG in Valdosta that serves Albany. WALB's original digital signal on UHF channel 17 started operating from the Doerun tower in 2001.\n\nIn June 2002, WALB donated over 1,600 cans of newsfilm to The Walter J. Brown Media Archives & Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia. The collection contains raw news footage from Albany and surrounding areas from 1961 to 1978, including coverage of the Albany Movement.\n\nWALB launched NBC Weather Plus in 2005 on a new second digital subchannel. Known as \"WALB 24/7 Weather\", the service gave continuous forecasts for up to thirty cities around Southwestern Georgia. After NBC Weather Plus shut down in December 2008, WALB-DT2 became part of This TV.\n\nLiberty merged with Raycom Media in 2005. Raycom already owned Fox affiliate WFXL, and could not keep both stations because Albany has only four full-power stations–not enough to legally permit a duopoly. Raycom opted to keep WALB and sell WFXL and eleven other stations to Barrington Broadcasting.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, a military chopper traveling from Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah to Fort Rucker in Alabama for a training mission hit a guy wire connected to WFXL's tower resulting in a crash. While the tower remained standing and intact (other than the guy wire), the station was forced to temporarily cease its over-the-air signal although broadcasts on cable were not affected. If its tower collapsed, this could have also caused the tower of WALB to topple as both were only apart. As a result, Raycom (which at that time still operated WFXL while the sale to Barrington awaited FCC approval) acquired auxiliary transmitters and antennas for both WALB and WFXL which were installed at the tower at WALB's studios in Albany. On June 7, WFXL's tower was demolished but in doing so one of the tower's guy wires wrapped around one for WALB's tower as feared. As a result, WALB's tower collapsed in an incident shown on live television. Since both stations were already transmitting signals from the tower at the WALB studios, the two were still on-the-air although at low-power. Thirteen months later, WALB and WFXL's new tower in Doerun was completed and began broadcasting on July 3, 2007 at 11:35 p.m.\n\nIt was announced on November 19, 2010 that WALB would begin airing ABC on its second digital subchannel scheduled to begin in early 2011. The subchannel officially joined ABC on April 27, 2011; prior to this, WTXL-TV had been carried on most cable systems in Southwestern Georgia since January 1992, when a plane crash forced WVGA to initially cease operations (some cable customers received ABC programming via the network's affiliates in Columbus, Atlanta, and Gainesville). Raycom affiliated 26 stations including WALB for multiple years with Bounce TV at the network's fall 2011 launch.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Gray Television announced its intent to acquire Raycom for $3.65 billion, pending regulatory approval. The sale was approved by the FCC on December 20. The sale was completed on January 2, 2019, returning WALB to the original ownership that brought it on the air.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWALB shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 17 to VHF channel 10 for post-transition operations.\n\nFor many years, WALB was the only big three affiliate to produce local news that actually focused on Albany. For most of WSWG's early tenure as a CBS affiliate, it served as a semi-satellite of WCTV in Tallahassee and simulcasted that station's newscasts with no Southwestern Georgia-specific segments. This changed when Gray sold off WSWG after reacquiring WALB; WSWG has since launched its own news operation.\n\nIn 2004, WALB gave its news operation a complete makeover renaming itself from \"NewsCenter 10\" to \"WALB News 10\". It also changed its logo as part of a graphics change. However, it kept the \"little one, big zero\" 10 which has been part of the logo since the late 1970s at the earliest. This is similar to sister station WIS in Columbia, South Carolina. The station also changed its music from \"The Team to Watch\", composed by VTS Productions to \"The Tower\", composed by 615 Music, which was used by many other NBC affiliates. Continuing its modernization, WALB built a new set in 2005 replacing the previous one used for at least twelve years.\n\nIts weekday morning show, \"Today in Georgia\", was expanded to a full two hours (from 5 to 7 a.m.) beginning September 10, 2007 coinciding with the expansion of \"Today\" to a four-hour program. On August 4, 2012, WALB upgraded local news production to high definition level. The change made it the second station in the market to perform the upgrade (WSWG's simulcast of WCTV's news programs was first back on August 3, 2009).\n\nWith the addition of ABC to WALB-DT2, there are simulcasts of local newscasts from the main NBC channel. More specifically, this includes the second hour of \"Today in Georgia\", its midday show at noon, as well as weeknight newscasts at 6 and 11. In addition, the area's first prime time broadcast at 7 was added on weeknights that is exclusive to the ABC subchannel. Weekend newscasts are simulcast on both of WALB's NBC and ABC channels although there can be a delay or pre-emption on one due to network obligations.\n\nOn September 6, 2016, WALB added a half-hour of news at 4 p.m., \"WALB News 10 – First News at 4.\"\n\n"}

Population: \n\nThe town is located northwest of Tver, in the Valdai Hills, between the Tvertsa and Tsna Rivers, on the watershed between the basins of the Volga and the Baltic Sea. Hence the town's name is translated from Russian as \"Upper Portage\".\n\nThe portage between the Tsna and the Tvertsa existed from the medieval times as confirmed by archaeological artifacts found in the area. Vyshny Volochyok as a settlement was mentioned in chronicles in 1471. In 1703-1722, Peter the Great had a canal constructed to link the two rivers (Vyshny Volochyok Waterway). In the 1740, the road connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg was built. These two events gave a start to the fast economic development of Vyshny Volochyok, which later also became a major center of textile manufacture and glass production. In 1772, the first fair was held, and in the first half of the 19th century the road was rebuilt in stone. In 1851, the railroad construction followed.\n\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Vyshny Volochyok was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. On May 28, 1770 Vyshny Volochyok was granted town rights, and on April 2, 1772 Vyshnevolotsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate was established, with the seat in Vyshny Volochyok. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Vyshny Volochyok was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed into Tver Governorate.\n\nOn July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Vyshnevolotsky District, with the administrative center in Vyshny Volochyok, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Vyshny Volochyok was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Vyshny Volochyok serves as the administrative center of Vyshnevolotsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Vyshny Volochyok Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Vyshny Volochyok Okrug is incorporated as Vyshny Volochyok Urban Okrug.\n\nThe economy of Vyshny Volochyok is based on timber, glassmaking, and textile industries.\n\nThe railroad connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg passes through Vyshny Volochyok.\n\nThe M10 highway, which connects Moscow and St. Petersburg, passes through the city as well. A road connecting to Maksatikha, Bezhetsk, and Rybinsk branches out east. There are local roads as well, with the bus traffic originating from Vyshny Volochyok.\n\nThe Tvertsa and the Msta are connected by the Vyshny Volochyok Waterway, constructed in the 18th century to provide for a waterway connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg, in particular, the Neva and the Volga. Currently, there is no passenger navigation.\n\nVyshny Volochyok contains twenty-four cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally forty-four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are the canals, dams, and embankments of the Vyshny Volochyok Waterway, the former Serdykov Estate related to the visits of Peter the Great to Vyshny Volochyok, as well as a number of buildings in the city center, including the trading arcades.\n\nVyshny Volochyok hosts a local museum which was open in 1932 (formally, it is a division of the Tver State United Museum). There is also a theater.\n\nIn the episode Limerick of Cabin Pressure, Vyshny Volochyok is mentioned at the start and has a limerick devoted to it near the end.\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Daredevil Third Brother\", he ranks 33rd among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nBrought up in Jiankang Prefecture, which is present-day Nanjing in Jiangsu, Shi Xiu has learnt martial arts since childhood. Intolerant of bullying, he often jumps into frays to help the party being victimised, even at the risk of his own life. He is thus nicknamed \"Daredevil Third Brother\". He travels around with his uncle, a tradesman always on the move. After his uncle died, he suffers losses and could not afford the journey home. He ends up in Jizhou (薊州; present-day Ji County, Tianjin), where he makes a living by selling firewood. \n\nOne day, when passing a busy street carrying firewood, Shi Xiu comes upon Yang Xiong, the chief warden of Jizhou's prison, being attacked by a group of hooligans. Yang has just executed a prisoner and is showered with gifts by cheering onlookers as he heads back to office. Coveting the gifts, the thugs pretend to greet him and then lunge forth to restrain him. Seeing that Yang is ambushed and outnumbered, Shi plunges into the scuffle and helps him drive away the attackers. Grateful to Shi Xiu, Yang Xiong requests that they become sworn brothers.\n\nYang Xiong invites Shi Xiu to live with him and sets up a meat shop for him to run. Shi Xiu is sharp-eyed and soon detects that Yang's wife Pan Qiaoyun is having a secret affair with the monk Pei Ruhai. He informs Yang Xiong about it. However, Yang goes to dine with his colleagues after the tip-off and in a drunken state chastises his wife for being unchaste when he gets home. He forgets the scolding the next day, which allows the woman to turn the table on Shi Xiu before Yang questions her. She lies that she has rejected Shi's advances, inducing Yang to conclude that Shi has bad-mouthed her so as to save himself. Believing his wife, Yang signals to Shi that their ties are severed by closing the meat shop. Knowing he has been maligned, Shi is determined to clear his name.\n\nOne night, Shi Xiu ambushes and kills Pei Ruhai in a deserted lane outside Yang Xiong's house when the monk is leaving it after a tryst with Pan. He then takes the monk's robe and other personal effects to show to Yang Xiong. Now quite convinced by Shi, Yang Xiong lures Pan Qiaoyun to Mount Cuiping (翠屏山; in present-day Jizhou, Hebei) under the pretext of visiting his ancestors' graves. On the hill, he and Shi Xiu confront her and demand she tells the truth. Scared, Pan admits her wrongdoings. Instigated by Shi, Yang kills her as well as her maid, who has acted as a lookout in the adultery. \n\nYang Xiong and Shi Xiu decide to seek refuge at the outlaw stronghold of Liangshan Marsh. They are joined by Shi Qian, who has chanced upon the killings while stealing from graves at Mount Cuiping. Along the way, they rest in an inn owned by the Zhu Family Manor. Shi Qian steals the inn's only rooster to cook for meal as the place has nothing nice to offer, sparking off a fight between the three and the innkeeper. Shi Xiu burns down the inn as the innkeeper fetches men to seize them. Shi Qian is caught in a trap as they flee. Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu stumble into the neighbouring Li Family Manor, where they run into Du Xing, who has once received help from Yang in Jizhou. Du takes them to his master Li Ying, who agrees to help them seek the release of Shi Qian. Li writes two consecutive letters to the Zhu Family Manor asking them to free the man, but the Zhus refuse both times. When Li Ying goes to confront them, he is injured by an arrow. Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu then proceed to Liangshan, their only hope to save Shi Qian. \n\nBefore the first battle between Liangshan and the Zhu Family Manor, Shi Xiu sneaks into the village disguised as a firewood seller. He finds out how to navigate the maze of roads winding among trees outside the manor from an aged villager. That lead helps the force of Song Jiang to get out when they lose their way among the trees in the first offensive. When the Zhus are not completely convinced that Sun Li has come to help them, Shi Xiu seals their trust by pretending to be captured by Sun in a one-on-one combat on horseback. When the Zhus lower their guard, Sun Li and his group attack them from within their ranks, seizing victory for Liangshan.\n\nThe story of Lu Junyi, a wealthy squire and a consummate fighter, starts with Liangshan setting him up to appear to be a rebel against the government. Lu is arrested in Daming prefecture, where he lives, and is sentenced to exile at Shamen Island. Lu's steward Li Gu, who takes over his property as well as his wife, bribes his two escorts to murder him on the way. But Lu is rescued by his servant Yan Qing, who kills the two guards. However, Lu, weak from days of torture, is caught again in an inn when Yan goes look for food. This time Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, the governor of Daming, immediately sentences him to death. Meanwhile, Yan Qing, who is rushing to Liangshan to seek help, runs into Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu, who are going to Daming to check on Lu. Yang returns to Liangshan with Yan while Shi Xiu continues on to Daming. Shi is shocked to learn that Lu is to be beheaded soon. He goes to the second floor of a restaurant where he could overlook the execution ground. Just as Cai Fu, the executioner, is about to chop off Lu‘s head, Shi Xiu leaps off from the building, shouting \"Liangshan heroes are here!\", which stuns everyone at the scene. He drags Lu away through the panicked crowd . But they are outnumbered and captured.\n\nWhen Shi Xiu is brought before Liang Shijie, he berates the official in a booming voice, calling him \"a slave of a slave's slave\". Shocked by Shi's fearless look and defiant words, Liang decides to keep them alive as they could be used as bargaining chips if Liangshan attacks. After some fruitless battles with Daming, Liangshan sends some chieftains to infiltrate the city on the night of Lantern Festival. They break into the jail and rescue Shi and Lu.\n\nShi Xiu is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. \n\nIn the battle of Yuling Pass (昱嶺關; near present-day Zhupu Village, She County, Anhui) in the campaign against Fang La, Shi Xiu is shot dead in an ambush by the archers of Pang Wanchun.\n\n"}

Specifically, an indicator chart records the pressure of steam versus the volume of steam in a cylinder, throughout a piston's cycle of motion in a steam engine. The indicator diagram enables calculation of the work performed and thus can provide a measure of the power produced by the engine.\n\nThe indicator diagram was developed by James Watt and his employee John Southern (1758–1815) to improve the efficiency of engines. In 1796, Southern developed the simple, but critical, technique to generate the diagram by fixing a board so as to move with the piston, thereby tracing the \"volume\" axis, while a pencil, attached to a pressure gauge, moved at right angles to the piston, tracing \"pressure\".\n\nThe gauge enabled Watt to calculate the work done by the steam while ensuring that its pressure had dropped to zero by the end of the stroke, thereby ensuring that all useful energy had been extracted. The total work could be calculated from the area between the \"volume\" axis and the traced line. The latter fact had been realised by Davies Gilbert as early as 1792 and used by Jonathan Hornblower in litigation against Watt over patents on various designs. Daniel Bernoulli had also had the insight about how to calculate work.\n\nWatt used the diagram to make radical improvements to steam engine performance and long kept it a trade secret. Though it was made public in a letter to the \"Quarterly Journal of Science\" in 1822, it remained somewhat obscure, John Farey, Jr. only learning of it on seeing it used, probably by Watt's men, when he visited Russia in 1826.\n\nIn 1834, Émile Clapeyron used a diagram of pressure against volume to illustrate and elucidate the Carnot cycle, elevating it to a central position in the study of thermodynamics.\n\nLater instruments (\"illus.\") used paper wrapped around a cylindrical barrel with a pressure piston inside it, the rotation of the barrel coupled to the piston crosshead by a weight- or spring-tensioned wire.\n\n"}

From 1725 to 1747 he held the tobacco monopoly in Austria, and had the power to establish factories and regulate prices. When in 1747 he asked the government to return to him a part of the money that he had deposited on account of the revenues, the empress Maria Theresa replied: \"This appears to me just.

Individual participants must raise at least $2,300 to walk 60 miles (96 km) over a three-day weekend.\n\nAs of 2013, the events are held in seven US cities. Seven additional cities included in previous years have been dropped due to a 37% decline in participation.\n\nThe 3-Day is a series of three-day, 60-mile walks that raise millions of dollars for breast cancer research, education, and community health programs. 3-Day participants raise a minimum of $2,300 and walk an average of 20 miles a day, educating thousands of people about breast health. Walkers must be at least 16 years old or be accompanied by an adult. Crew members must be at least 18 years old, and volunteers must be at least 10 years old. A program called Youth Corps allows children ages 10–16 who have been affected by breast cancer to get involved, by providing the walkers with a youthful, energetic helping hand. The Komen 3-Day supports its participants before the event by providing coaches, training assistance, fundraising advice and a personal fundraising webpage.\n\nThe net proceeds fund breast cancer research, education, and community outreach programs. Since its inception, more than $860 million has been raised, but only approximately 15% of funds Komen received goes towards the cancer research the organization exists to raise money for.\n\nThe first concept for a three-day walk for breast cancer was created and produced in 1998 by Dan Pallotta and Pallotta TeamWorks benefitting the Avon Foundation. In late Aug 2002 Avon introduced its own two-day walk (the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a 39.3-mile walk over two days). The first day of the Avon walk is the distance of a marathon, 26.2 miles, and the second day is a half-marathon, 13.1 miles, for a total of 39.3 miles. In 2003, the Breast Cancer 3-Day debuted with event manager and beneficiary, National Philanthropic Trust, and primary beneficiary, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. The event is now managed by Event 360, is simply referred to as the Susan G. Komen 3-Day, and has as its exclusive beneficiary, Susan G.

Arizona, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., however, have been cut from the said event. But the 2013 3-Day events went on in those areas as planned. The event planners said in their official Facebook page, \"The difficult decision to exit these markets was not made lightly, as we know this bold and empowering event has touched the lives of thousands of participants like you.

Indeed, the term is used by people all across the political spectrum to refer to the journalists and political operatives who see themselves as the arbiters of conventional wisdom. As such, the notion of \"chattering classes\" can be seen as an antonym to the older idea of an unrepresented silent majority, made notable by the U.S. Republican Party President Richard Nixon.\n\nIn the United States, the term has come to be used by both the right and left to describe political opponents, with Stephen Perrault of the Merriam-Webster dictionary suggesting that the term has \"connotations of idleness, of useless talk, that the noun 'chatter' does. ... These people don't amount to much — they like to hear themselves talk.\"\n\n"}

On 8 December 1756, he married Sarah (Simha) Mendes da Costa (born c.1742, died 5 May 1763), daughter of Moses Mendes da Costa, who is reported to have brought him a fortune of £150,000. She was the mother of his two legitimate daughters. He also had a son. He succeeded to his father's title and fortune in 1759, and for a time lived in luxurious style with twenty servants at the Broad Street Buildings. By the time of the American Revolutionary War, however, d'Aguilar had lost an American estate of 15,000 acres (61 km²).\n\nSubsequently, he became known as a miserly and eccentric person, giving up his mansion in Broad Street as well as his country houses at Bethnal Green, Twickenham, and Sydenham. His establishment at Colebrook Row, Islington, was popularly styled \"Starvation Farm\", because of the scanty food provided for the cattle. He came a freemason in 1778. Upon his death there in 1802, d'Aguilar left a fortune valued at £200,000 hidden throughout the dwelling to his two daughters who survived him.\n\nD'Aguilar held various positions in his community, and served as treasurer of the Portuguese Synagogue; the minutes of the proceedings of the Mahamad bear the signature of Ephraim d'Aguilar. He was elected warden in 1765, but declined to serve, and refused on technical grounds to pay the fine. D'Aguilar was given eight days to accept the position or to submit to the penalty. He evidently submitted, since on 5 March 1767 he married Rebecca, née Lamego (dsp 30 November 1795), daughter of Isaac Lamego and widow of Benjamin Mendes da Costa, the elder (the father of Benjamin Mendes da Costa?), Chairman of the Committee of Diligence. He would not have been able to marry her had he been lying under the ban. When d'Aguilar took up his eccentric life, however, the couple separated. After twenty years, a partial reconciliation took place between the baron and his wife, but only for a short time. d'Aguilar was again elected to office in 1770, and for some years thereafter remained a member of the synagogue.\n\n"}

In 1853 it was promoted as Diocese of Roermond and gained territory from the Belgian Diocese of Liège.\n\nDuring the sixties of the twentieth century, the relatively strong demarcation between the Catholic south on one side and the Calvinist west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. In the second half of the twentieth century a rapid secularization and strong loss of religious affiliation have taken place in Limburg.\n\nThe diocese has roughly 817,000 registered Roman Catholics (about 72.3% of the population of Limburg). Roughly 3 percent of the population in the Diocese Roermond attends Mass on Sundays (as per official Church (KASKI) data).

In the novel, a group of five disaffected citizens, each representing a different ideological persuasion and personality type, conspire to overthrow the Russian imperial regime through a campaign of sustained revolutionary violence. The film, set in contemporary Paris and largely taking place in a small apartment, is structured as a series of personal and ideological dialogues dramatizing the interactions of five French university students — three young men and two young women — belonging to a radical Maoist group called the \"Aden Arabie Cell\" (named after the novel \"Aden, Arabie\" by Paul Nizan).\n\nThe five members are Véronique (Anne Wiazemsky), Guillaume (Jean-Pierre Léaud), Yvonne (Juliet Berto), Henri (Michel Semeniako) and Kirilov (Lex de Bruijin). A black student named Omar (Omar Diop), \"Comrade X\", also makes a brief appearance. The two main characters, Véronique and Guillaume Meister (the latter named after the titular hero of Goethe's famous 1795 bildungsroman \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\"), discuss the issue of revolutionary violence and the necessity of political assassination to achieve revolutionary goals. As an advocate of terrorism as a means of bringing about the revolution, Veronique roughly corresponds to the character of Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky in \"The Possessed\". Véronique and Guillaume are engaged in a personal relationship, with Véronique as the more committed, dominant partner.\n\nYvonne is a girl from the country who occasionally works as a prostitute for extra money to purchase consumer goods (much like Juliette Janson, the principal character in Godard's previous film, \"Two or Three Things I Know About Her\"). Yvonne does most of the housecleaning in the apartment and, together with Guillaume, she acts out satirical political skits protesting American imperialism in general, and U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policy in particular.\n\nHenri is eventually expelled from the group for his apparent backsliding Soviet revisionism, comically suggested by his defense of the 1954 Nicholas Ray movie \"Johnny Guitar\". In this sense he loosely corresponds to the character of Ivan Shatov in \"The Possessed\", a student who is marked for assassination because he has abandoned the tenets of leftist radicalism.\n\nKirilov is the only character in the film who actually takes his name from a character in Dostoyevsky's novel; in \"The Possessed\", Kirillov is a suicidal Russian engineer who has been driven to nihilism and insanity by the failure of his philosophical quest. True to his literary namesake, Godard's Kirilov also descends into madness and ultimately commits suicide.\n\nEventually, Véronique's once tender feelings toward Guillaume sour, and she uses a declaration of \"unlove\" to teach him (and the audience) the Maoist lesson of \"struggle on two fronts\". Véronique then leaves the apartment alone and sets off for what will prove to be a botched attempt to kill the Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union during his official diplomatic visit to France.\n\nOn the train ride \"en route\" to the planned assassination, Véronique is engaged in a discussion with the political philosopher, Francis Jeanson (Jeanson was actually Anne Wiazemsky's philosophy professor at the Paris X University Nanterre during 1966–67; a few years earlier, he had once been a communist and the head of a network which supported the Algerian national liberation movement. This led to his highly publicized arrest and trial by the French government in September 1960.)\n\nIn the scene on the train, Jeanson argues against the use of violence as a means to shut down the French universities. However this does not dissuade Véronique (for her dialogue in this scene, Godard fed Anne Wiazemsky her lines through an earpiece). The appearance of Francis Jeanson in the film seems to correspond with the character of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky (Pyotr's father and Stavrogin's surrogate father) in \"The Possessed\". Indeed, much like Stepan Trofimovich, Jeanson is an intellectual and philosopher who serves as a kind of father-figure/mentor to Véronique — and his early example as a supporter of terrorism makes him responsible for influencing much of the destruction which is to follow.\n\nEventually the train arrives at its destination, and Véronique sets off to the hotel where the Soviet Minister of Culture is staying. She mistakenly reverses the digits of the room number and ends up killing the wrong man. As in \"The Possessed\", the revolutionary activities of the Aden Arabie cell have proved unsuccessful.\n\nThematically, \"La Chinoise\" concerns the 1960s New Left political interest in such historical and ongoing events as the legacy of Lenin's October 1917 Russian Revolution, the escalating U.S. military activities in the increasingly unstable region of southeast Asia, and especially the Cultural Revolution brought about by the Red Guards under Mao Zedong in the People's Republic of China. The film also touches upon the rise of anti-humanist poststructuralism in French intellectual life by the mid-1960s, particularly the anti-empiricist ideas of the French Marxist, Louis Althusser.\n\nGodard likewise portrays the role that certain objects and organizations — such as Mao's Little Red Book, the French Communist Party, and other small leftist factions — play in the developing ideology and activities of the Aden Arabie cell. These objects and organizations appear to become repurposed as entertainment products and fashion statements within a modern consumer-capitalist society — the very society which the student radicals hope to transform through their revolutionary project.\n\nThis paradox is illustrated in the various joke sunglasses that Guillaume wears (with the national flags of the USA, USSR, China, France and Britain each filling the frames) while reading Mao's Little Red Book, as well as the sight gag of having dozens of copies of the Little Red Book piled in mounds on the floor to literally create a defensive parapet against the forces of capitalist imperialism, and a jaunty satirical pop song, \"Mao-Mao\" (sung by Claude Channes), heard on the soundtrack. Godard suggests that the students are at the same moment both serious committed revolutionaries intent on bringing about major social change.\n\n\"La Chinoise\" is not one of Godard's most widely seen films, and until 2008 was unavailable on DVD in North America. However a number of critics such as Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris and Renata Adler have hailed it as among his best. Given that the film was made in March 1967 — one year before violent student protest became a manifest social reality in France — \"La Chinoise\" is now regarded as an uncannily prescient and insightful examination of the New Left activism during those years.\n\nAlong with \"Pierrot le fou\", \"Masculin, féminin\", \"Two or Three Things I Know About Her\" and \"Week End\", \"La Chinoise\" is often seen as signaling a decisive step towards Godard's eventual renunciation of \"bourgeois\" narrative filmmaking. By 1968 he had switched to an overtly-political phase of revolutionary Maoist-collectivist didactic films with Jean-Pierre Gorin and the Dziga Vertov Group, which lasted for the next six years until 1973.\n\n"}

Pierre's passion is flying, and he flies his own private plane, after previously having been an air force pilot. Pierre has a young son, Nicolas, from his first marriage, which dissolved when his wife left him for another man. Pierre, Charlotte, and Nicolas live together in a modern apartment outside Paris. Charlotte spends her days going to cafes, shopping, swimming, at the cinema, reading women's fashion magazines, or with her lover, Robert, an actor. Pierre believes that Charlotte's affair is over, having previously confronted her with evidence from a private investigator.\n\nAs the film opens, Charlotte and Robert are in a Paris love nest that Robert has rented. They make love, and he repeats an earlier request that Charlotte divorce Pierre to marry him. Leaving the apartment, Robert drives Charlotte to the department store Printemps, where she says she is going buy new bras. (Indeed, the film is permeated by shots of advertisements for bras and Charlotte's monologues or dialogues about breast size and body image.) However, instead of shopping, she cuts through the store and Charlotte takes a series to taxis to avoid a private investigator who she thinks is still following her, and she goes to collect her stepson from school. They go to an airport to collect Pierre and his colleague, the filmmaker Roger Leenhardt, who have returned from Germany in Pierre's private plane. While in Germany, Pierre and Roger attended sessions of the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, and both men have an interest in the Holocaust. They go back to the couple's apartment for dinner. After dinner they discuss the Holocaust and move to the question of memory and one's relationship to the past and present. After Roger's departure, Charlotte and Pierre play-fight and make love.\n\nThe next morning, the maid tells Charlotte a story of a ribald love-making session with her own husband. For this narrative, Godard borrowed from Louis-Ferdinand Céline's \"Death on Credit\", which he acknowledges indirectly in the film. Charlotte then attends a fashion photo-shoot at a swimming pool and eavesdrops at a nearby café as two teenage girls discuss their love lives and first sexual encounters.\n\nCharlotte goes to the doctor and learns that she is pregnant. She does not know which man is the father and asks the doctor about contraception, leading to a discussion of the relationship between love, sexual pleasure, and conception.\n\nCharlotte then goes to Orly Airport for an assignation with Robert, as previously arranged, before he has to fly to Marseille to act in a production of Racine's \"Bérénice\". They meet in the back of the airport's cinema, during a screening of \"Night and Fog\", Alain Resnais's documentary about the Holocaust. Partway through the film, they leave the theater separately and rendezvous at the airport hotel to make love. During their time together, Charlotte questions Robert about love. They hold hands on the mattress of the bed, echoing the opening shots of the movie. As Robert prepares to leave, they both say – one after the other – \"C'est fini\" (\"It's over.\").\n\nWhilst in Cannes in May 1964 Godard met Luigi Chiarini, the director of the 1964 Venice Film Festival, and offered to make a film that would be completed in three months in time to premiere at Venice – the festival would run from August 27 to September 10. The film would be the story of a woman, her husband, and her lover, and the woman would find out that she is pregnant and not know whose child it is. The situation was mirrored to a great extent in François Truffaut's \"La Peau Douce\", a film Godard admired, that had been based on the story of Truffaut's own infidelity. Godard wrote to Truffaut telling him he would take his film in a different direction if he thought his project too similar. Yet while Truffaut's film was a 'compact, classical melodrama' Godards would be 'an explicitly and stringently modernist film', the melodrama subordinated 'to a surprisingly abstract style of filming'. Having liked André Cayatte's pair of films, \"\"/\"\" – \"L'Amour conjugale\", 1963, Godard chose Macha Méril, an actress who had featured in both in a supporting role, to play Charlotte.\n\n\"The Married Woman\" – Godard's original title for his film – was shown at the Venice Film Festival on 8 September 1964. It was well received. Michelangelo Antonioni, whose first colour film \"Red Desert\" was also being shown in competition, went up to Godard after the screening and congratulated him. And it was praised by French critics. \"Cahiers du cinéma\", which had not praised \"Bande à part\", greeted \"The Married Woman\" as a major artistic and intellectual work. In September however, the Commission de Controle (the censorship board) voted 13-5, with two abstentions, to ban the film. Objections centred on the title, which the board said implied all married women were adulterous, and on the film's devotion 'to the salacious illustration of scenes of sexuality.' The commission's reasons were not made public but were relayed to the minister of information, Alain Peyrefitte. He agreed to meet Godard and months of debate and negotiation followed. Godard believed the real problem was political and that 'The people of the commission have sensed that my film attacks a certain mode of life, that of air conditioning, of the prefabricated, of advertising'. Ultimately, Godard made a few changes, including the title, though he refused to remove references to concentration camp inmates that Peyrefitte had wanted. The film was released on December 5.\n\nThe credits are accompanied by a Beethoven string quartet – one of five that are heard in the course of the film. \"Quand le film est triste\", sung by Sylvie Vartan, accompanies a montage of magazine advertising images.\n"}

As a reward Babur gave his daughter in marriage to him. He also married Humayun`s niece who is the daughter of Pir Haibat, of Kandahar which ultimately leads to his death during Akbar's reign. Raja Shadi Khan Khan, was a contemporary and feudatory of the Emperors Babur, Humayun and Akbar; and he ruled over the districts of Bhimbar and Nowshera, within the present limits of Jammu and Kashmir. In consideration of services rendered to the Emperor Akbar in Kandahar, he was made Governor of Kashmir with the title of Shadab Khan. He also served as governor of kandhar during Akbar reign. His tribe, the Chib Rajputs of Kashmir and Punjab, come to his shrine in Jandi Chontra in Bhimber to pay their respects and ritualistically celebrate the births of their children. In the last few decades, the popularity of the shrine has grown among non-tribe members due to the belief that visiting the shrine will help childless couples to bear children.\n\nOriginally Rajput, the ruling family embraced Islam at a later date which is uncertain, but probably not later than the time of Babar, from whom the head of the family, named Shadi, is said to have received a confirmation for his possessions. He took the name of Shadab Khan, and is said to have accompanied Humayun on some of his expeditions, and was finally killed by one, Pir Haibat, of Kandahar, and has ever since been venerated as a saint. His tomb is near Bhimbar, and is a place of pilgrimage to which both Hindus and Muslims resort. The shrine is called Sur Sadi Shahid. At his shrine every Chib child must be presented on attaining a certain age, so that the lock of hair, specially retained for the purpose, may be cut off with much ceremony; without this he cannot become a true Chib.\n"}

He succeeded his relative Danilo I as Metropolitan in 1735, having served as Danilo's coadjutor since the 1719, when he was consecrated by Serbian Patriarch Mojsije I.\n\nSava was a lesser memorable figure in Montenegrin history, having served during a period of constant and bitter tribal rivalries and power struggles in tribal leadership.\n\nA contemplative who was happier as a studious monk than resolving conflicts, Sava preferred to leave his countrymen as they had been in the past, dependent on Venice and thus necessarily paying taxes to the Ottoman \"beys\".\n\nIn 1735, the year in which Sava officially became the Metropolitan (\"vladika\", rendered as \"prince-bishop\") of Cetinje, a new war broke out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, which Austria soon entered on Russia's side. Predictably this was welcomed by the Serbs in Austria-Hungary, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro in particular, who were ready to sacrifice everything in their long struggle for total independence. \"hajduk\" (bandit and rebel) activity increased, threatening not only Ottoman-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina but also the coastal territory of Dalmatia ruled by Venice and by neighbouring Republic of Ragusa. Unable to impose firm leadership, Sava obviously had little or no influence on events that transpired; he still continued to seek some sort of appeasement with Venice, a policy that suited his conservative nature. Sava's goal was to secure more open borders for Montenegro, which was already suffering under blockades imposed by its invading Western and Eastern neighbours on all sides.\n\nThe Austrian government had induced the Serbs to leave their villages and towns and join the Austrian army. The good will of the Serbian hierarchy was needed by the Austrians in the continuing wars against the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, early Austrian successes in the campaign against the Ottomans, supported by Serb volunteers, were followed by serious reverses, after which Austria was forced to yield territory; by autumn 1739 the Austrians had been forced to sign the Treaty of Belgrade which saw the Kingdom of Serbia (including Belgrade), the southern part of the Banat of Temeswar and northern Bosnia to be ceded to the Ottomans (these were mostly gains in the wars of 1714-1718).\n\nIn Montenegro, the pattern of raids and counter-attacks continued unabated with Highlander tribes (in \"Brda\") taking the brunt of Ottomans reprisals. In 1740, the new Pasha of Scutari began preparations for an offensive in the region on a scale that appeared to make successful resistance impossible. Opting for negotiations instead of warfare, the Highlander tribes sent forty of their chieftains to an arranged location for talks only to have them captured and decapitated, and another 400 of their compatriots taken into slavery on the orders of the paša himself.\n\nHard-pressed, Sava decided to follow his predecessor's example by seeking help from Orthodox Russia, offering to provide troops to serve in the Imperial Russian armies in return for some form of Russian protectorate over Montenegro. At the end of September 1742 Sava set off in person, and on reaching St. Petersburg the following spring he presented Montenegro's case to the newly enthroned Empress Elizabeth. The empress promised financial aid, including further funds for the Cetinje monastery, but was unwilling to broach the question of a political arrangement that would afford Montenegro any military protection. Journeying back by way of Berlin, Frederick the Great gave him a beautiful golden cross, but such tokens of consideration, though well intended, fell short of meeting his hopes, and his journey far from proving a turning-point in Montenegro's fortunes, served rather to prompt his withdrawal from public life. From 1744 to 1766, Metropolitan Vasilije Petrović Njegoš, Sava's coadjutator, became effectively the highest authority in Montenegro and its representative abroad. After Vasilije died at St. Petersburg in 1766, Sava again resumed his duties as Metropolitan (Prince-Bishop).\n\nIn 1766 the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was banned by the Ottomans (the Greek clergy also applied pressure in this matter). Sava then responded by writing to the Moscow Metropolitan that \"\"the Serb Nation is under hard slavery\"\" and so asked the Holy Synod of Russia to help the Serbian Patriarch. Sava also wrote a letter to the Russian Empress asking \"\"Protect the Serbs from the Greek and Turkish intruding [...] We are ready to pay Russia in blood\"\". He enumerated the Montenegrins among this \"Serbian nation\".\n\nIn 1767, he wrote to the Republic of Ragusa that the Cetinje Metropolitanate was \"\"happy that the [Ragusan] government still used our Serbian language\"\".\n\nHe was succeeded as Metropolitan by Petar I Petrović-Njegoš.\n\n\n"}

It is based on the 1987 comic novel of the same name by Boyd Oxlade.\n\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 1991, \"Death in Brunswick\" won Film Score of the Year.\n\nSet and filmed in Brunswick, a Melbourne suburb, it deals with a humble chef, Carl (Neill) who gets a job at a sleazy nightclub owned by Yanni Voulgaris (Nicholas Papademetriou). He begins a relationship with the Greek-Australian barmaid, Sophie (Zoe Carides), which soon brings him into trouble with his employers and her strict father. His drug dealing Turkish-Australian co-worker, Mustafa (Nick Lathouris), is beaten up by the Greek-Australian owners. Thinking Carl told them, Mustafa attacks Carl. Carl accidentally stabs and kills him.\n\nHe calls his friend, Dave (Clarke), a grave digger, and they bury Mustafa. This leads to one of the most famous scenes in the film—Dave's idea that they bury the body in the opened grave of someone else whose husband will be buried above her the following day. Dave expects the coffin of the deceased to be comparatively empty, given how long it has been since she died. When he finds that the rate of decomposition is not what he expects, he begins to stomp and crush her body to make some room.\n\nLater, Mustafa's wife and son come to the restaurant and ask Carl if they know what happened to Mustafa. Carl denies having any knowledge and is wracked with guilt. He gives Mustafa's pay to his wife, even though Dave tells him that it might make him suspect. Later Mustafa's son sees him at a pool with Sophie. Knowing that Sophie is also having a relationship with one of the Greek owners, Mustafa's Turkish friends confront Carl.\n\nBelieving the Greek owners to be responsible, they get their revenge on them, ironically killing the one who was originally responsible for beating Mustafa in the first place. Carl leaves his job and is later comforted when he sees Mustafa in the church (albeit, in a dream) who offers him a friendly handshake. After his domineering mother suffers a stroke and is left a quadriplegic, Carl marries Sophie, despite her father's protests and the final scene from their wedding is reminiscent of the Last Supper.\n\n\nThe film was shot from 15 January to 5 March 1990.\n\nOriginal Music Score Composed and Produced by New Zealand-born musician Philip Judd.\n\nDavid Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz, film critics for \"The Movie Show\" awarded the film four-and-a-half stars out of five. Stratton described the film as \"a black comedy which isn't afraid to take risks, to shift moods, to push to the limit\".\n\n\"Sydney Morning Herald\" film critic, Rob Lowing praised the performances of Sam Neill, Zoe Carides and John Clarke. Lowing described the film as \"a gem of a black comedy and certainly the best that Australia has produced in years\".\n\n\"Death in Brunswick\" grossed $2,725,169 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $4,305,767\nin 2009 dollars.\n\n\n\n"}

Created in 1965, it is mandated to deal with high risk situations like hostage taking, emotionally disturbed persons, high risk arrests, warrant service, and protection details. The ETF mission profile also includes terrorism and counter-terrorism threats in some extreme cases.\n\nThe ETF was created in 1965. An earlier non-SWAT Riot and Emergency Squad emerged in 1961. Part of its role is now undertaken by the ETF, Public Safety and Emergency Management, and the Mounted Unit.\n\nThe Emergency Task Force currently comprises 82 officers from all units who are tactically trained. There are seven Special Weapons Teams consisting of 10 officers each. The teams are on-call 24 hours a day, every day of the week. Each tactical team has a team leader, assaulters, snipers, bomb technicians, and a negotiator. All team members are trained as assaulters, and thus are able to perform any necessary tasks requiring force.\n\nThe negotiation team consists of the two ETF Staff Sergeant supervisors. If a situation is not resolved by a member of a Special Weapons Team, who is a trained negotiator, the negotiation team will be called in to take over the negotiations. In more complex calls involving suicidal, homicidal-suicidal, or violent emotionally disturbed individuals, a forensic psychiatrist, who has been on the negotiation team for the past 22 years, can be called to the scene to advise the negotiators and/or incident commander.\n\nThe unit is located in Toronto, in a building that was built in 1989. It contains:\n\nThree of the TPS's specialized units compose the ETF. These include the special weapons teams (tactical), explosive disposal unit (EDU), and the emergency response unit (ERU). The ERU provides specialized equipment for the ETF, including high powered lights, crane, and the mobile command post.\n\nThe teams train at their Don Mills station, as well as at CFB Borden, a Canadian Forces (CF) base approximately an hour and a half drive north of Toronto. The unit also trains with members of the CF's counter-terrorism unit Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2), who are based at the Dwyer Hill Training Facility outside of Ottawa.\n\nIn a medical situation, Toronto EMS tactical paramedics in body armour work along with the ETF.\n\nThe ETF maintains a close working relationship with other police tactical teams of the Greater Toronto Area, including the York Regional Police Emergency Response Unit (ERU), the Durham Regional Police Tactical Support Unit (TSU) and the Peel Regional Police Tactical and Rescue Unit (TRU).\n\nThe ETF use the MP5A3 sub-machine gun, Remington 700 bolt-action sniper rifle, Remington 870 shotgun, and the Diemaco C8 carbine, while Glock 17 or 19 handguns are authorized as sidearms.\n\nLess than lethal options are also at the disposal of team members: these include X26 Tasers, pepper spray (OC Spray) and tear gas (CS Gas), and rubber bullets or bean bag rounds.\n\nETF also operates Northrop Grumman Remotec Andros MK V1A bomb disposal remote robots to defuse suspected bombs or suspicious objects. The newest robot used by the team is the Remotec Andros F6B.\n\nThe vehicles used by the team include the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition, Ford F150, Ford F550, Ford Explorer and Ford Taurus Police Interceptor. They also have a number of Chevrolet express vans as RDVs. Since the summer of 2005, the ETF also have an armoured car, the Armet Trooper, which can be used to rescue injured civilians or officers.\n\nCurrently, the Toronto Police Service does not have its own helicopter, but has access to the helicopters from York and Durham Regional Police, along with the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nETF responded to an operation that involved rescuing a hostage-taking situation on December 31, 1999.

A man with a history of domestic violence took a woman hostage, holding her at gunpoint during morning rush hour just outside Union Station in downtown Toronto. The incident ended when an ETF sharpshooter fired a shot, killing the man. The hostage was traumatized but unharmed.\n\nETF responded to another operation that involved an off-duty 33 Division Officer inside a CIBC bank on Lawrence and Victoria Park. On February 26, 2008, ETF, K-9 and officers from 33 Division were called to a bank robbery in progress. Unknown to the 16-year-old suspect, officers surrounded the bank and waited for the suspect to exit. The suspect left the bank only to be tackled by the off-duty officer and awaiting ETF.\n\nETF officers were involved with Project Fusion arrests. This was an investigation led by the Province of Ontario Guns and Gangs Task Force, whose officers were working hand-in-hand with other services, mainly the Durham Regional Police Drug and Gang Enforcement Units. These arrests happened on the morning of April 1, 2009 and saw over 120 locations raided by not only Toronto Police tactical officers, but officers from surrounding police services as well from as far away as Belleville and London, Ontario. In total, 38 police tactical units were used for these warrants. The centre of the raids was at the area of Markham and Eglinton, but also included locations in Peel and York Region, along with several locations in Durham Region.\n\nThe ETF responded to a call on board a TTC bus in which an EDP tried to hijack the bus at knife point on August 2, 2016. The ETF and their psychiatrist negotiated with the man for over 5 hours and were successful in getting him to surrender, they have been highly praised by the media for taking the time to resolve the scene peacefully.\n\nThe Canadian television series \"Flashpoint\", which aired in both Canada and the United States from 2008 to 2012, focused on a fictional version of the ETF called the \"Strategic Response Unit\" (SRU).\n\nFictional versions of the ETF and their officers have also been depicted in other police procedural television series which have been set in Toronto, notably \"Rookie Blue\" (2010-2015), \"The Bridge\" (2010), and \"Cracked\" (2013).\n\n\n"}

Some are architects and civil engineers, working on some of the more prominent buildings and construction projects in Hong Kong. Some are information technology professionals, and some are in professional services (accounting, culinary, dentistry, design, finance, law, music, pastoral ministry ) too. A significant proportion of those employed as domestic workers in Hong Kong have other professions in the Philippines, even those with university degrees work in Hong Kong because of better financial opportunities.\n\nThe first Filipinos to have worked professionally in Hong Kong were these groups who went to Hong Kong during the post-World War II years and following the fall of the Mainland to the Communists in 1949. Many Filipinos also work in service industries in the Central business district, and also in Hong Kong Disneyland as entertainers or other cast members.\n\nEastern District has the highest concentration of Filipino residents of any district in Hong Kong, with 3.24% of the district's population being of Filipino descent (14,596 people).\n\nMost Filipinos in Hong Kong communicate with the local population in English (usually a second language for both parties). However, they communicate with their own friends and community in Tagalog or in another Philippine language. Most of them have also picked up a few Cantonese phrases in everyday life. A few are adept at Cantonese usage.\n\nFilipinos haven't settled long enough in Hong Kong to have a large number who know Cantonese fluently, unlike some of the other ethnic minorities such as the Pakistanis and the Indians who often speak Cantonese as well as their Chinese neighbours. This is because most Filipino workers are transients who do not intend to settle in Hong Kong—each year, a large number of these leave Hong Kong permanently, to be replaced by a different set of Filipinos who have to learn Cantonese from the beginning.\n\nThe World-Wide House arcade in Central is popular with the Filipinos, as many of the shops inside the building are run by Filipinos. The wide assortment of typically small shops caters to their needs, selling telecommunications and banking services, to food, and magazines.\n\nOn Sundays, one can usually encounter a large number of Filipino maids gathered at various spots in Central, including the ground floor of the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building. Many maids in Hong Kong have Sunday as their fixed once-a-week working day off, during which they socialise, eat self-prepared food, sing, and even sell various items. This weekly gathering is such a long-standing practice that the \"No Littering\" signs in the vicinity are written in three languages: Chinese, English and Tagalog.\n\nMost Filipinos in Hong Kong are Christians, the majority Roman Catholic. There are also a sizable number who congregate in Protestant and non-denominational churches. A minority are Muslims or Buddhists. Many spend at least a part of their Sunday mornings attending Mass and various church services. Numerous Catholic parishes in Hong Kong offer Masses in Tagalog or English geared towards the Filipinos. According to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong (2011), there is an estimated 120,000 Filipino Catholics who make up a large part of the non-local parish membership.\n\nAside from the Catholics, there are significant congregations of Filipino Protestants who attend services in Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches. There is also a full fellowship of Aglipayans or members of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church) that attend mass at the St John's Cathedral in Central, an Anglican church. Rev. Fr. Dwight Dela Torre is the resident Filipino chaplain. \n\nIn past 30 years, Filipino evangelical Christians grew drastically in numbers especially with such fellowship as the Jesus is Lord (JIL) which number in the tens of thousands.\n\n\n"}

Nearly all infants exhibit a swallowing pattern involving tongue protrusion, but by six months of age most lose this reflex allowing for the ingestion of solid foods.\n\nSince 1958, the term \"tongue thrust\" has been described and discussed in speech and dental publications by many writers. Many school-age children have tongue thrust. For example, according to recent literature, as many as 67–95 percent of children 5–8 years old exhibit tongue thrust, which may be associated with or contributing to an orthodontic or speech problem. Up to the age of four, there is a possibility that the child will outgrow tongue thrust. However, if the tongue thrust swallowing pattern is retained beyond that age, it may be strengthened.\n\nFactors that can contribute to tongue thrusting include macroglossia (enlarged tongue), thumb sucking, large tonsils, hereditary factors, ankyloglossia (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also allergies or nasal congestion can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to tongue thrusting. In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (acute muscular dystonia) after use of neuroleptics (anti-psychotics). \n\nTongue extrusion is normal in infants.\n\nTongue thrusting can adversely affect the teeth and mouth. A person swallows from 1,200 to 2,000 times every 24 hours with about four pounds (1.8 kg) of pressure each time. If a person suffers from tongue thrusting, this continuous pressure tends to force the teeth out of alignment. People who exhibit a tongue thrust often present with open bites; the force of the tongue against the teeth is an important factor in contributing to \"bad bite\" (malocclusion). Many orthodontists have completed dental treatment with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case relapsed because of the patient's tongue thrust. If the tongue is allowed to continue its pushing action against the teeth, it will continue to push the teeth forward and reverse the orthodontic work.\n\nSpeech may be affected by a tongue thrust swallowing pattern. Sounds such as /s/, /z/, /t/, /d/, /n/, and /l/ are produced by placing the tongue on the upper alveolar ridge, and therefore a tongue thrust may distort these sounds . \n\nChewing and swallowing with dysfunctional muscle patterning (as in a tongue thrust) is not as effective as a normal chewing and swallowing motion. \n\nTreatment options for tongue thrust may include orthodontic spikes, prongs or other tongue reminders, which redirect the tongue rest posture and swallow. Orofacial myofunctional therapists teach oral rest posture and chewing/swallowing mechanics without appliances. \n\n\n"}

At first he was no chronicler but he did eventually write descriptions of the south-east Asia he saw in 1583–1591, and upon his return to England, in 1591, became a valuable consultant for the British East India Company.\n\nFitch's place of birth has long been a mystery but recent research indicates that he was most likely born in All Saints' parish, Derby. The first known documentary reference to him is in the archives of the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers, of which he was a Freeman and from which Company he received a loan of £50 for two years, 1575-77. In February 1583 he embarked in the \"Tyger\" for Tripoli (the seaport of Aleppo) in Syria, together with merchants John Newberry and John Eldred, a jeweller named William Leedes and a painter, James Story, all financed by the Levant Company. This was the latest in a series of English attempts to penetrate the trade of the Indian Ocean and Far East, going back to Anthony Jenkinson's travels in Central Asia in the 1550s. From Aleppo they reached the Euphrates, descended the river from Bir to Fallujah, crossed southern Mesopotamia to Baghdad, and dropped down the Tigris to Basra (May to July 1583). Here Eldred stayed behind to trade, while Fitch and the others sailed down the Persian Gulf to the Portuguese fortress and trading station at Ormuz, where they were promptly arrested as spies (at Venetian instigation, they claimed, as the Venetians resented the 16th-century Portuguese commercial monopoly in the Indian Ocean that called an end to centuries of Venetian, Genoese and Pisan – plus Catalan – dealings with Arab middlemen, down from the Middle Ages) and sent as prisoners to the Portuguese viceroy at Goa (September to October).\n\nThrough the sureties procured by two Jesuits (one being Thomas Stevens, formerly of New College, Oxford, the first Englishman known to have reached India by the Cape route in 1579), Fitch and his friends regained their liberty. Story chose to join the Jesuits, and the others managed to escape from Goa (April 1584). They travelled through the heart of India to the court of the Great Mogul Akbar, then probably at Agra. The jeweller Leedes obtained a remunerative post with Akbar while Fitch continued his journey of exploration. Fitch did the first leg of that journey, from Agra to Allahabad, by joining a convoy \"of one hundred and fourscore boates laden with Salt, Opium, Hinge (asafoetida), Lead, Carpets and diverse other commodities\" going \"downe the river jumna (Yamuna)\". He reached Allahabad sometime in November 1585, when work on Akbar's great Fort at Allahabad was nearing completion. In September 1585 Newberry decided to begin his return journey overland via Lahore. He disappeared, presumably being robbed and murdered, in the Punjab.\n\nFitch went on, descending the Jumna and the Ganges, to visit Allahabad, Benares, Patna, Kuch Behar, Hughli, Chittagong, etc. (1585–1586). He then pushed on by sea to Pegu and Burma. Here he visited the Rangoon region, ascended the Irrawaddy some distance, acquired a remarkable acquaintance with inland Pegu, and even penetrated to the Tai Shan states and the Tai kingdom of Lanna (December 1586 and January 1587).\n\nEarly in 1588 he visited Malacca, another of Portugal's great fortresses and the gateway to the Far East, but found the security too strict to get passage into the China Sea. In the autumn of this year he began his homeward travels, first to Bengal; then round the Indian coast, touching at Cochin and Goa, to Ormuz; next up the Persian Gulf to Basra and up the Tigris to Mosul (Nineveh); finally via Tirfa, Bir on the Euphrates. He was appointed the Levant Company's Consul in Aleppo and Tripoli, to the Mediterranean. He arrived back in London on 29 April 1591, eight years after he had left. Since no news of him had reached his family and friends in that time, he had been presumed dead after seven years and his will had been proved. He resumed his involvement with the Leathersellers' Company, becoming a Liveryman in 1599, serving as Warden in 1607 and joining the Company's Court of Assistants in 1608. His experience was greatly valued by the founders of the East India Company, including another of Elizabeth's adventurers Sir James Lancaster who consulted him on Indian affairs.\n\nFitch ranks among the most remarkable of Elizabethan adventurers. There is no evidence he ever married and the main beneficiaries of his final will in 1611 were eight nieces and two nephews.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Archive files are used to collect multiple data files together into a single file for easier portability and storage, or simply to compress files to use less storage space. Archive files often store directory structures, error detection and correction information, arbitrary comments, and sometimes use built-in encryption.\n\nArchive files are particularly useful in that they store file system data and metadata within the contents of a particular file, and thus can be stored on systems or sent over channels that do not support the file system in question, only file contents – examples include sending a directory structure over email.\n\nBeyond archival purposes, archive files are frequently used for packaging software for distribution, as software contents are often naturally spread across several files; the archive is then known as a package. While the archival file format is the same, there are additional conventions about contents, such as requiring a manifest file, and the resulting format is known as a package format. Examples include deb for Debian, JAR for Java, and APK for Android.\n\nFeatures supported by various kinds of archives include:\n\nSome archive programs have self-extraction, self-installation, source volume and medium information, and package notes/description. \n\nThe file extension or file header of the archive file are indicators of the file format used. Computer archive files are created by file archiver software, optical disc authoring software, and disk image software.\n\nAn archive format is the file format of an archive file. Some formats are well-defined by their authors and have become conventions supported by multiple vendors and communities.\n\n\nFilename extensions used to distinguish different types of archives include zip, rar, 7z, and tar.\n\nJava also introduced a whole family of archive extensions such as jar and war (\"j\" is for Java and \"w\" is for web). They are used to exchange entire byte-code deployment. Sometimes they are also used to exchange source code and other text, HTML and XML files. By default they are all compressed.\n\nArchive files often include parity checks and other checksums for error detection, for instance zip files use a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). RAR archives may include redundant error correction data (called recovery records).\n\nArchive files are sometimes accompanied by separate parity archive (PAR) files that allow for additional error detection and recovery, particularly in recovery of missing files in a multi-file archive.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332684", "title": "Altamura", "text": "Altamura\n\nAltamura (, ; ) is a town and \"comune\" of Apulia, in southern Italy. It is located on one of the hills of the Murge plateau in the Metropolitan City of Bari, southwest of Bari, close to the border with Basilicata. , its population amounts to 70,595 inhabitants.\n\nThe city is known for its particular quality of bread called Pane di Altamura, which is sold in numerous other Italian cities. The 130,000-year-old calcified Altamura Man was discovered in 1993 in the nearby limestone cave called \"grotta di Lamalunga\".\n\nThe area of modern Altamura was densely inhabited in the Bronze Age (La Croce settlement and necropolis). The region contains some fifty tumuli. Between the 6th and the 3rd century BC a massive line of megalithic walls was erected, traces of which are still visible in some areas of the city.\n\nThe city was inhabited until around the tenth century AD. Then it was reportedly looted by Saracens. There are no reliable sources confirming what the original name of Altamura was. Inside the Tabula Peutingeriana, only \"Sublupatia\" occurs, which may refer either to Santeramo in Colle, Altamura or to a small region nearby named \"Jesce\". \"Sublupatia\" implies that a city whose name was \"Lupatia\" was also present, even though there is no mention of \"Lupatia\" either in Tabula Peutingeriana or the Antonine Itinerary. Nevertheless \"Lupatia\" occurs in Ravenna Cosmography (Byzantine period) and in Guido of Pisa's work \"Geographica\" (Middle Ages).\n\nAccording to an ancient legend, appearing for the first time in the 13th century AD, Altamura's former name was \"Altilia\", from \"Alter Ilium\", the \"other Troy\". According to a legend, it was founded by a friend of Aeneas, Antellus, also a fugitive from the Asian city destroyed by the Greeks. Another legend attributes the foundation to Althea, queen of the Myrmidons. Ottavio Serena, as early as in 1880, rejected the above legends as well as the belief that the ancient name of Altamura was Altilia, as it lacked reliable sources. Serena suggested that this name may have originated with an unknown High Middle Ages scholar who tried to provide an explanation of the ruins found in that place.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries AD, Altamura was also mistaken for the ancient city of \"Petilia\". The belief that Petilia was the ancient name of Altamura at that time was so strong that on some Italian translations of Ptolemy's Geography, \"Petilia\" was translated as \"Petilia, now Altamura\", despite the coordinates given by Ptolemy unequivocally pointed toward today's Calabria.\nThe hypothesis that Altamura was the ancient city of Petilia probably originated with Raffaello Maffei, as he was the first known author that suggested it. Leandro Alberti, instead, was the first scholar who dismissed that Altamura was Petilia in his work \"Descrittione [sic] di tutta Italia\" (1550).\nAccording to modern scholars, Petilia probably refers to the archeological remains found on Monte Stella.\n\nA couple of centuries after Altamura was reportedly looted by the Saracens, it started to be inhabited again as emperor Frederick II refounded the city (1232) and ordered the construction of the large Altamura Cathedral, which became one of the most venerated sanctuaries in Apulia. In 1248, under pressure from Frederick, Pope Innocent IV declared Altamura exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Bari, making it a \"palatine church\", that is the equivalent of a palace chapel.\n\nAltamura was ruled by various feudal families, including the Orsini del Balzo and the Farnese (1538–1734), the latter responsible of the construction of numerous palaces and churches. In the past, Altamura also had a large castle, whose construction dated back to the 11th-13th century, which has been completely demolished and is not visible anymore. In 1748 Charles VII of Naples had a university built in the city.\nIn 1799, an important event in the history of Altamura, commonly labelled as Altamuran Revolution, took place. In February 1799, the city joined the Parthenopean Republic, after the king had fled to Palermo fearing for his safety. From 8 February 1799 to 9 May 1799, the city was self-governed and it joined the ideals spread by the French Revolution. On 9 May, Sanfedisti reached Altamura, and after a battle on the city walls, the rule of the Kingdom of Naples was restored in Altamura too. During the Risorgimento (19th century), Altamura was the seat of the Insurrection Bari Committee and, after the unification, the provisional capital of Apulia.\n\nDuring World War II, the transit camp known as P.G. 51 was located at Villa Serena in Altamura.\n\nThe city is located in the south-west area of the Metropolitan City of Bari, near the borders with the Province of Matera, in Basilicata. The bordering municipalities are Bitonto, Cassano delle Murge, Gravina in Puglia, Grumo Appula, Matera, Ruvo di Puglia, Santeramo in Colle and Toritto.\n\nSome of the communal territory are included in the Alta Murgia National Park.\n\nAltamura's main landmark is the Romanesque cathedral, begun in 1232 by Frederick II and restored in 1330 and 1521–47. It is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia, the others being the cathedral of Acquaviva delle Fonti, the Basilica of San Nicola in Bari and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano. The construction is influenced by that of Bari, but also with strong Gothic influences typical of the time of Frederick II. The orientation of the construction was probably changed during the 14th century restoration, to which also belongs the northern portal opening on the square; a second bell tower, the altar area and the sacristy are instead from the 16th century. Externally, the main features are the rose window, with 15 small columns radially intermingling, and the Gothic portal, set into the entrance portico standing on two stone lions. On the arch of portals are sculpted 22 panels with scenes from Jesus' life. The interior, with a nave and two aisles, has stone presepe by Altobello Persio (1587).\n\nThe medieval walls, erected by Frederick II, rest upon the megalithic walls of an ancient city of unknown name. These early walls are of rough blocks of stone without mortar.\n\nAncient tombs with fragments of vases and terracottas have also been found, of which there is a collection at the Museo Archeologico Statale di Altamura. There are caves which have been used as primitive tombs or dwellings, and a group of some fifty tumuli near Altamura.\n\nSome thirty thousand dinosaur footprints were recently discovered in Altamura's territory \"contrada Pontrelli\", making it a major site for the study of dinosaurs.\n\nA three-day renaissance fair called Federicus is held every year in the city, usually on the last weekend of April.\n\nBanca Popolare di Puglia e Basilicata, a cooperative bank of southern Italy, is based in Altamura. The bank is a successor of Banca Popolare della Murgia.\n\n\nThe city is crossed by the SS7 \"Via Appia\" national road.\n\nAltamura railway station, operated by the national company FS and by FAL, is located on the regional lines Rocchetta Sant'Antonio-Altamura-Gioia del Colle (FS), Bari-Altamura-Matera (FAL) and\n\nAltamura-Avigliano-Potenza (FAL). Also the municipal localities of Casal Sabini, Marinella and Pescariello have their own stations. The one of Sanuca was closed in the late 1990s.\nAltamura is twinned with:\n\nThe 31st tank regiment of the Italian Army is stationed at Altamura.\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally small pieces of boneless chicken baked using skewers on a brazier called angeethi after marinating in Indian spices and dahi (yogurt)—essentially a boneless version of tandoori chicken. The word \"tikka\" (Tike in Turkish, and Tikə in Azerbaijani) is a Hindi and Urdu word and means \"bits\" or \"pieces\". It is also a chicken dish served in Punjabi cuisine. The Kashmiri version of the dish, however, is grilled over red-hot coals, and does not always contain boneless pieces. The pieces are brushed with \"ghee\" (clarified butter) at intervals to increase its flavour, while being continuously fanned. It is typically eaten with green coriander and tamarind chutney served with onion rings and lemon, or used in preparing a chicken \"tikka masala\".\n\nA chicken \"tikka\" sizzler is a dish where chicken \"tikka\" is served on a heated plate with onions. The dish is also popular in Afghanistan, though the Afghan variant (like many other Persian, Turkish, and Arab dishes) is less spicy compared to the variants in the Indian subcontinent and uses beef and lamb in addition to chicken.\n"}

He published his first work while still a law-student at Toulouse, where he won a prize (1565) in the Académie des Jeux Floraux. It was a collection of lyrical pieces, now lost, entitled \"Plaintes amoureuses de Robert Garnier\" (1565). After some legal practice at the Parisian bar, he became \"conseiller du roi au siège présidial\" and \"sénéchaussée\" of Le Maine, his native district, and later \"lieutenant-général criminel\". His friend Lacroix du Maine says that he enjoyed a great reputation as an orator. He was a distinguished magistrate, of considerable weight in his native province, who gave his leisure to literature, and whose merits as a poet were fully recognized by his own generation.\n\nIn his early plays he was a close follower of the school of dramatists who were inspired by the study of Seneca. In these productions there is little that is strictly dramatic except the form. A tragedy was a series of rhetorical speeches relieved by a lyric chorus. His pieces in this manner are \"Porcie\" (published 1568, acted at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1573), \"Cornélie\" and \"Hippolyte\" (both acted in 1573 and printed in 1574). In Porcie the deaths of Cassius, Brutus and Portia are each the subject of an eloquent recital, but the action is confined to the death of the nurse, who alone is allowed to die on the stage. His next group of tragedies \"Marc-Antoine\" (1578), \"La Troade\" (1579), \"Antigone\" (acted and printed 1580) shows an advance on the theatre of Étienne Jodelle and Jacques Grévin, and on his own early plays, in so much that the rhetorical element is accompanied by abundance of action, though this is accomplished by the plan of joining together two virtually independent pieces in the same way. In 1592 The Countess of Pembroke wrote \"The Tragedy of Antonie\", an English version of Garnier's play.\n\nIn 1582 and 1583 he produced his two masterpieces \"Bradamante\" and \"Les Juives\". In Bradamante, which alone of his plays has no chorus, he cut himself adrift from Senecan models, and sought his subject in Ariosto, the result being what came to be known later as a tragicomedy. The dramatic and romantic story becomes a real drama in Garnier's hands, though even there the lovers, Bradamante and Roger, never meet on the stage. The contest in the mind of Roger supplies a genuine dramatic interest in the manner of Corneille.\n\n\"Les Juives\" is the moving story of the barbarous vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar on the Jewish king Zedekiah and his children. The Jewish women lamenting the fate of their children take a principal part in this tragedy, which, although almost entirely elegiac in conception, is singularly well designed, and gains unity by the personality of the prophet. (The critic M. Faguet says that of all French tragedies of the 16th and 17th centuries it is, with Athalie, the best constructed with regard to the requirements of the stage. Actual representation is continually in the mind of the author; his drama is, in fact, visually conceived.)\n\nGamier must be regarded as the greatest French tragic poet of the Renaissance and the precursor of the baroque theater of the 17th century. He exercised a major influence on the development of Elizabethan tragedy. Thomas Kyd is the likely author of an English translation of \"Cornélie\" published in England in the early 1590s.\n\n"}

She is the national spokesperson for the Campaign for a Landmine-Free World. Between 1997 and 2003, she served in the same capacity for the \"International Campaign to Ban Landmines\", which is affiliated with the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation.\n\nUng was born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the sixth of seven children and the third of four girls, to Seng Im Ung and Ay Choung Ung. At ten years of age, she escaped from Cambodia as a survivor of what became known as \"the Killing Fields\" during the reign of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime. After emigrating to the United States and adjusting to her new country, she wrote two books which related her life experiences from 1975 through 2003.\n\nToday, Ung is married and lives with her husband in Shaker Heights, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, US.\n\nUng's first memoir, \"First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers\", details her experiences in Cambodia from 1975 until 1980:\n\"From 1975 to 1979—through execution, starvation, disease, and forced labor—the Khmer Rouge systematically killed an estimated two million Cambodians, almost a fourth of the country's population. This is a story of survival: my own and my family's. Though these events constitute my own experience, my story mirrors that of millions of Cambodians. If you had been living in Cambodia during this period, this would be your story too\".\nPublished in the United States in 2000 by HarperCollins, it became a national bestseller, and in 2001 it won the award for \"Excellence in Adult Non-fiction Literature\" from the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association. \"First They Killed My Father\" has subsequently been published in twelve countries in nine languages and has a film adaptation. \n\nHer second memoir, \"Lucky Child: A Daughter of Cambodia Reunites with the Sister She Left Behind\", chronicles her adjustment to life in the U.S. with and without her family, and the experiences of her surviving family members in Cambodia during the ensuing warfare between Vietnamese troops and the Khmer Rouge. It covers the period of 1980 until 2003, and HarperCollins published it in 2005.\n\nIn both of her memoirs, Ung wrote in the first person and, for the most part, in the present tense, describing the events and circumstances as if they were unfolding before the reader's eyes: \"I wanted [the readers] to be there\".\n\nUng's father was born in the small village of Tro Nuon in Kampong Cham province in 1931. Her mother was from China and moved with her family to Cambodia when she was a little girl. They married against her family's wishes, and eventually came to live with their children in a third-floor apartment in the center of the bustling capital city of Phnom Penh. Due to his record of service in the previous government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Ung's father was conscripted into the government of Lon Nol, and became a high-ranking military police officer. Ung's mother supported her family as a homemaker. The family was relatively well-off and owned two cars and a truck, and their house used running water, a flushable toilet, and an iron bathtub. They also had telephones as well as the daily services of a maid, and often enjoyed films at the nearby theater and swimming in the pool at a local club. By her own account, Loung lived a happy and carefree life in a close-knit loving family, until April 17, 1975, when the Khmer Rouge gained control of Cambodia and evacuated Phnom Penh.\n\nLoung was playing near her home when trucks filled with Khmer Rouge troops rolled into her neighborhood. The populace of Phnom Penh, estimated at nearly two million people, was forced to evacuate. The Ungs abruptly left their home with what few belongings they could stow in their truck. When the truck ran out of fuel, they gathered the bare essentials that they could carry and began what became a seven-day trek toward Bat Deng in a throng of evacuees, harried by the bullhorns of the soldiers. Along the way, they stopped at night to sleep in the fields and to search for food. Seng Im Ung, posing as the father of a peasant family, was fortunate to get by a military checkpoint in Kom Baul without being detained; many evacuees who were perceived to be a threat to the new government, because of their previous education or political position, were summarily executed there. \nOn the seventh day, as the Ungs neared Bat Deng, Loung's uncle found them and arranged to bring them by wagon to his village of Krang Truop.\n\nUng and her family stayed only a few months in Krang Truop because Loung's father was afraid that newly arrived evacuees from Phnom Penh would reveal his identity. Thus, he made arrangements for the family to be transported to Battambang, the village of Loung's grandmother. However, this plan was thwarted by the Khmer Rouge soldiers. Instead, the Ung family was taken, along with about 300 other evacuees, to the village of Anglungthmor, where they stayed for five months. During that time, more than half of these new arrivals at Anglungthmor died of starvation, food poisoning, or disease. Malnourishment was severe. \nAgain fearing that discovery of his ties to the Lon Nol government was imminent, Loung's father pleaded to have his family relocated. The Khmer Rouge ordered them taken to Ro Leap, where about sixty other families arrived on the same day.\n\nRo Leap was Ung's home for the next eighteen months. Cut off from all outside communication and constantly in fear of soldiers who patrolled the village, the Ungs were forced by the Khmer Rouge to work long hours with very little food. Near-starvation and physical exhaustion became a way of life. A few months after their arrival, Loung's oldest brothers, eighteen-year-old Meng and sixteen-year-old Khouy, and her oldest sister, fourteen-year-old Keav, were sent away to work in different camps. Six months later, in August 1976, Keav died of food poisoning at the teenagers’ work camp at Kong Cha Lat. In December, two soldiers came to the Ungs' hut and demanded the help of Loung's father to free a stuck wagon; he was never seen or heard from again.\n\nLoung and her brother, eleven-year-old Kim, and her two sisters, nine-year-old Chou and four-year-old Geak, remained in Ro Leap with their mother until May 1977. During this time, they avoided starvation with the help of Meng and Khouy, who brought them what little food they could from their work camp, and by Kim, who risked his life late at night by stealing corn from the crops guarded by the soldiers. In May, agitated by screams in the night and the sudden disappearance of a neighboring family, Ay Ung sent Kim, Chou, and Loung away from Ro Leap with instructions to pretend they were orphans and never to come back. Kim separated from his sisters, while Loung and Chou found a nearby children's work camp where their guise as orphans was accepted. In time, Loung and Chou gained strength with improved food rationing, and in August 1977, Loung, now seven years old, was assigned to a training camp for child soldiers, and was forced to leave her sister Chou behind.\n\nFor the following seventeen months, Loung Ung learned how to fight the Vietnamese soldiers. In November 1978, she left her camp under cover of night without permission, and returned to Ro Leap to see her mother and sister. Upon arriving, she found the hut empty, although her mother's belongings were still there. The woman in the neighboring hut told her that Ay and Geak had been taken away by the soldiers. They also were never seen again.\n\nIn January 1979, the Vietnamese army gained control of Phnom Penh and continued their invasion westward. Mortar explosions in her camp forced Ung and her fellow villagers to flee for their lives. In the ensuing chaos, her brother Kim and sister Chou found her on the road, and they set out for Pursat City, stopping only to rest and find food. Several days later, they entered Pursat City, a refugee camp under the control of comparatively friendly Vietnamese troops, and eventually they were given shelter by families willing to take them in. The camp was sporadically attacked by Khmer Rouge soldiers, and Loung, nearly nine years old, saw more of the horrors of warfare.\n\nIn March 1979, Meng and Khouy, both of whom had also escaped their camps when the Vietnamese invaded, arrived at Pursat City. In April, the reunited Ungs set out on an eighteen-day trek to Bat Deng, where they stayed with their uncle Leang and his family. During this time Meng married Eang, a twenty-year-old Chinese girl who was separated from her family, in a ceremony arranged by Loung's uncle and aunt. In time, they learned that Eang's mother and father were safe in Vietnam, and Meng and Eang went to see them. With their aid, Meng and Eang devised a plan to get to Thailand via Vietnam, and then, they hoped, to the United States. Meng returned alone to Bat Deng. With limited resources, he could afford to take only one family member with him back to Vietnam; he chose Loung.\n\nIn October, Loung and Meng were smuggled into Vietnam via a fishing boat, and stayed with Eang and her family. In December, Loung, Meng, and Eang moved to a houseboat in Long Deang in preparation for their prearranged escape to Thailand. In February 1980, after a perilous three-day voyage across the Gulf of Thailand in the hands of paid professionals, they arrived at the Lam Sing refugee camp on the coast of Thailand. Among the thousands of refugees who were waiting for sponsorship to go to another country, the Ungs waited four months in Lam Sing before they found out that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Holy Family Church in Essex Junction, Vermont, would be their sponsors. In the middle of June 1980, Loung, Meng, and Eang boarded a plane at Bangkok International Airport and headed for their new home.\n\nTheir sponsors brought the Ungs by car from Burlington International Airport to Essex Junction, Vermont, and ushered them into a small one-bedroom apartment above a dentist's office at 48 Main Street. The dining room doubled as Loung's bedroom. Church members continued to help the Ungs adjust and provided tutoring in the English language. In a few months, Meng, whose grasp of English was good, obtained employment as an interpreter for newly arrived refugees in Vermont, and Eang found work at a local manufacturing company. In September, Loung, age ten, began her formal education in the United States in the third grade. The early years of her education were difficult for Loung because of the language barrier, and she continued to be tutored during those years. In the late stage of Eang's pregnancy, Meng abandoned his studies at a nearby college and began working at two jobs; on December 21, Meng and Eang's daughter Maria was born.\n\nIn 1983, Loung entered the ADL Intermediate School, and continued with English language learning and teaching (ESL) sessions. Meng and Eang both found employment with IBM on the evening shift, and Loung, now thirteen years old, cared for Maria after school until they returned home late at night. Meng sent money and packages, via the Asian community in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to his family in Cambodia as often as he could throughout the 1980s; some packages either did not arrive or arrived with some of the contents missing. In 1985, Eang gave birth to her second daughter, Victoria, and Loung entered Essex Junction High School as a freshman. A few months later, Meng and Eang were sworn in as naturalized citizens of the United States. In early 1986, the Ungs moved, with the help of their sponsors, into their own modest two-story home in a nearby neighborhood, and Loung, now nearly sixteen years old, delighted in having her own personal room.\n\nLater that year Loung's teacher praised her for a sophomore English class paper she had written about growing up in Cambodia, and he encouraged her to write the whole story. During her six years in the U.S., Loung had often dealt with bouts of sadness and loneliness. After attempting suicide, she took pencil and paper and began to write the story of her life in Cambodia, her family, and the Khmer Rouge. \nOver many months, her journal came to number hundreds of pages, and Loung continued to maintain a journal for many years. In retrospect, Loung has stated that untangling her feelings and putting them into words throughout those years was very therapeutic for her.\n\nIn 1989, Loung graduated from high school, and in the fall, she entered Saint Michael's College with the financial assistance of a full four-year scholarship provided by the Turrell Scholarship Fund. During her college years, she made a conscious decision to become an activist and met her future husband. In early 1992, Loung studied at Cannes International College as part of Saint Michael's curriculum. During that time, she was reunited with her youngest brother Kim, who had fled Cambodia to Thailand and was brought to France via Germany with the help of his Aunt Heng in 1985. In 1993, Loung graduated from Saint Michael’s College with an B.A in Political Science, and found work as a community educator at a shelter for abused women in Lewiston, Maine.\n\nIn 1995, Ung traveled back to Cambodia for the first time since she had fled fifteen years earlier. During this visit, she and Meng and his family reconnected with the family they had left behind, and learned of the murders of many of their relatives during the Khmer Rouge reign. Some time after returning to the U.S., Ung left Maine and moved to Washington, D.C., and in late 1996, joined the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF), an international humanitarian organization that provides physical rehabilitation clinics, prostheses, and mobility devices free of charge in many countries and in several provinces in Cambodia. In 1997, she was awarded a Herbert Scoville Jr. Peace Fellowship, where she worked at the Peace Action Education Fund researching weapons trafficking and landmine legislation. In 2005, Loung made her twenty-fifth trip to Cambodia as the VVAF's spokesperson for the \"International Campaign to Ban Landmines\". The VVAF has, since 1991, fitted more than 15,000 victims with the means to walk and enjoy a better quality of life. Bobby Muller, chairman of the foundation, has remarked that \"...what comes out [when Loung lectures] is just staggering. It rocks people. She's the best thing this organization has ever had to advance our agenda\". The campaign won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997.\n\nLoung, Meng and Kim returned to Bat Deng in 1998 for a large family reunion with Khouy, Chou and all their relatives, including their 88-year-old grandmother. The Ungs arranged a Buddhist ceremony to honor their parents, Sem and Ay, and their sisters, Keav and Geak, who had all died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge regime; the service was attended by many hundreds of relatives and friends. Two years later, her first memoir was published. In 2002, Loung married her college sweetheart, Mark Priemer, and bought two and a half acres of land in Cambodia just a short distance from her sister Chou's home. During commencement ceremonies at Saint Michael's College in May 2002, Loung was inducted into the inaugural class of the college's Alumnae Academic Hall of Fame: \"Saint Michael's is proud beyond measure to honor its 1993 graduate, Loung Ung\". In 2003, she was chosen by Saint Michael's to address the graduating class. Her second memoir was published in 2005.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the article \"Cambodian refugee had new difficulties after move to U.S.\", published by the \"Nashua Telegraph\" on Sunday, April 17, 2005.\n\n\"Ung recently moved to suburban Cleveland where her husband grew up. He knows, though, that someday he'll probably be living in Cambodia where Ung owns 2½ acres and plans to build a home. For now, she keeps plenty of reminders of the country in her fourth-floor home office — a statue of Buddha, a photograph of a palm tree and rice field that she feels captures the country's beauty. Her office overlooks a wood deck that has been painted rusty red to remind her of the soil of her native home. She's working on her first novel, set in 1148 in Cambodia. She's shy about revealing the plot. Again, she's sure it will only sell 10 copies.\"\n\nUng's first book has been criticized by members of the Cambodian community in the United States, a number of whom believe that it is more a work of fiction than an actual autobiography. She has also been accused of misrepresenting the Khmer race and playing on ethnic stereotypes for the purpose of self-aggrandizement and over-dramatization to increase sales and publicity.\n\nAmong the complaints that some Cambodians have about her works is that she was only five years old when the Khmer Rouge began its reign, and that she could not possibly have so vivid and detailed a memory of the events as they have been documented in her book. Her detractors also claim that, as a child of a Chinese mother and a Khmer father highly placed in the Phnom Penh government, she paints a very unfavorable picture of Khmer villagers.\n\nThere is a picture in \"First They Killed My Father\" that was supposedly taken \"on a family trip to Angkor Wat\" in 1973 or 1974. A civil war had been in progress in Cambodia since 1970 and the Khmer Rouge was in control of Siem Reap (the location of Angkor Wat) from 1973 onward. Critics state that it is not likely that Ung's family would be vacationing at that time in that region of Cambodia, that the picture was taken at Wat Phnom, which is in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and that Ung's memory is therefore unreliable.\n\nIn December 2000, Ung responded to the earliest of these criticisms.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332747", "title": "Samuel David Luzzatto", "text": "Samuel David Luzzatto\n\nSamuel David Luzzatto (; ) was an Italian Jewish scholar, poet, and a member of the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement. He is also known by his Hebrew acronym, Shadal ().\n\nLuzzatto was born at Trieste on 22 August 1800 (Rosh Hodesh, 1 Elul, 5560), and died at Padua on 30 September 1865 (Yom Kippur, 10 Tishrei 5626). While still a boy, he entered the Talmud Torah of his native city, where besides Talmud, in which he was taught by Abraham Eliezer ha-Levi , chief rabbi of Trieste and a distinguished pilpulist, he studied ancient and modern languages and science under Mordechai de Cologna, Leon Vita Saraval, and Raphael Baruch Segré, whose son-in-law he later became. He studied the Hebrew language also at home, with his father, who, though a turner by trade, was an eminent Talmudist.\n\nLuzzatto manifested extraordinary ability from his very childhood, such that while reading the Book of Job at school, he formed the intention to write a commentary thereon, considering the existing commentaries to be deficient. In 1811 he received, as a prize, Montesquieu's \"Considérations sur les Causes de la Grandeur des Romains,\" etc., which contributed much to the development of his critical faculties. Indeed, his literary activity began in that very year, for it was then that he undertook to write a Hebrew grammar in Italian; translated into Hebrew the life of Aesop; and wrote exegetical notes on the Pentateuch. The discovery of an unpublished commentary on the Targum of Onkelos induced him to study Aramaic.\n\nAt the age of thirteen Luzzatto was withdrawn from school, attending only the Talmud lectures of Abraham Eliezer ha-Levi. While reading the Ein Yaakov he came to the conclusion that the vowels and accents did not exist in the time of the Talmudists, and that the Zohar, speaking as it does of vowels and accents, must necessarily be of later composition. He propounded this theory in a pamphlet which was the origin of his later work \"Vikkuach 'al ha-Kabbalah.\"\n\nIn 1814 there began a most trying time for Luzzatto. As his mother died in that year, he had to do the housework, including cooking, and to help his father in his work as a turner. Nevertheless, by the end of 1815 he had composed thirty-seven poems, which form a part of his \"Kinnor Na'im,\" and in 1817 had finished his \"Ma'amar ha-Niqqud,\" a treatise on the vowels. In 1818 he began to write his \"Torah Nidreshet,\" a philosophico-theological work of which he composed only twenty-four chapters, the first twelve being published in the \"Kokhebe Yiẓḥaḳ,\" vols. 16-17, 21-24, 26, and the remainder translated into the Italian language by M. Coen-Porto and published in \"Mosé,\" i-ii. In 1879 Coen-Porto published a translation of the whole work in book form. In spite of his father's desire that he should learn a trade, Luzzatto had no inclination for one, and in order to earn his livelihood he was obliged to give private lessons, finding pupils with great difficulty on account of his timidity. From 1824, in which year his father died, he had to depend entirely upon himself. Until 1829 he earned a livelihood by giving lessons and by writing for the \"Bikkure ha-'Ittim\"; in that year he was appointed professor at the rabbinical college of Padua.\n\nAt Padua, Luzzatto had a much larger scope for his literary activity, as he was able to devote all his time to literary work. Besides, while explaining certain parts of the Bible to his pupils he wrote down all his observations. Luzzatto was the first Jewish scholar to turn his attention to Syriac, considering a knowledge of this language of significant importance for the understanding of the Targum. His letter published in Kirchheim's \"Karme Shomeron\" shows his thorough acquaintance with Samaritan.\n\nHe was also one of the first Jews who permitted themselves to emend the text of the Old Testament (others, though with a lesser degree of originality, include Samson Cohen Modon and Manassa of Ilya); many of his emendations met with the approval of critical scholars of the day. Through a careful examination of the Book of Ecclesiastes, Luzzatto came to the conclusion that its author was not Solomon, but someone who lived several centuries later and whose name was \"Kohelet\". The author, Luzzatto thinks, ascribed his work to Solomon, but his contemporaries, having discovered the forgery, substituted the correct name \"Kohelet\" for \"Solomon\" wherever the latter occurred in the book. While the notion of the non-Solomonic authorship of Ecclesiastes is today accepted by secular scholars, most modern scholars do not ascribe the work to an actual individual named \"Kohelet\", but rather regard the term as a label or designation of some kind, akin to the Septuagint's translation of \"Preacher.\"\n\nAs to the Book of Isaiah, in spite of the prevalent opinion that chapters 40-66 were written after the Babylonian captivity, Luzzatto maintained that the whole book was written by Isaiah. He felt that one of the factors that pushed scholars to post-date the latter portion of the book stemmed from a denial of the possibility of prophetic prediction of distant future events, and therefore was a heretical position. Difference of opinion on this point was one of the causes why Luzzatto, after having maintained a friendly correspondence with Rapoport, turned against the latter. Another reason for the interruption of his relations with the chief rabbi of Prague was that Luzzatto, though otherwise on good terms with Jost, could not endure the latter's extreme rationalism. He consequently requested Rapoport to cease his relations with Jost; but Rapoport, not knowing Luzzatto personally, ascribed the request to arrogance.\n\nLuzzatto was a warm defender of Biblical and Talmudical Judaism; and his strong opposition to philosophical Judaism (or \"atticism\" as he terms it) brought him many opponents among his contemporaries. However, his antagonism to philosophy was not the result of fanaticism nor of lack of understanding. He claimed to have read during twenty-four years all the ancient philosophers, and that the more he read them the more he found them deviating from the truth. What one approves the other disproves; and so the philosophers themselves go astray and mislead students. Another of Luzzatto's main criticisms of philosophy is its inability to engender compassion towards other humans, which is the focus of traditional Judaism (or, as Luzzatto terms it, \"Abrahamism\").\n\nFor this reason, while praising Maimonides as the author of the Mishneh Torah, Luzzatto blames him severely for being a follower of the Aristotelian philosophy, which (Luzzatto says) brought no good to himself while causing much evil to other Jews. Luzzatto also attacked Abraham ibn Ezra, declaring that Ibn Ezra's works were not the products of a scientific mind, and that as it was necessary for him in order to secure a livelihood to write a book in every town in which he sojourned, the number of his books corresponded with the number of towns he visited. Ibn Ezra's material, he declared, was always the same, the form being changed sometimes slightly, and at other times entirely. Luzzatto's pessimistic opinion of philosophy made him naturally the adversary of Spinoza, whom he attacked on more than one occasion.\n\nDuring his literary career of more than fifty years, Luzzatto wrote a great number of works and scholarly correspondences in Hebrew, Italian, German and French. Besides he contributed to most of the Hebrew and Jewish periodicals of his time. His correspondence with his contemporaries is both voluminous and instructive; there being hardly any subject in connection with Judaism on which he did not write.\n\n\n\nIsaiah Luzzatto published (Padua, 1881), under the respective Hebrew and Italian titles \"Reshimat Ma'amarei SHeDaL\" and \"Catalogo Ragionato degli Scritti Sparsi di S. D. Luzzatto,\" an index of all the articles which Luzzatto had written in various periodicals.\n\nThe \"\"Penine Shedal\"\" (\"The Pearls of Samuel David Luzzatto\"), published by Luzzatto's sons, is a collection of 89 of the more interesting of Luzzatto's letters. These letters are really scientific treatises, which are divided in this book into different categories as follows: bibliographical (numbers 1-22), containing letters on Ibn Ezra's \"Yesod Mora\" and \"Yesod Mispar\"; liturgical-bibliographical and various other subjects (23-31); Biblical-exegetical (32-52), containing among others a commentary on Ecclesiastes and a letter on Samaritan writing; other exegetical letters (53-62); grammatical (63-70); historical (71-77), in which the antiquity of the Book of Job is discussed; philosophical (78-82), including letters on dreams and on the Aristotelian philosophy; theological (83-89), in the last letter of which Luzzatto proves that Ibn Gabirol's ideas were very different from those of Spinoza, and declares that every honest man should rise against the Spinozists.\n\n\n"}

In the 1874 revision of the Federal Constitution it was given the task to oversee laws concerning the issuing of banknotes. In 1891, the Federal Constitution was revised again to entrust the Confederation with sole rights to issue banknotes. The Swiss National Bank was founded by virtue of the Federal Act on the Swiss National Bank, which entered into force on 16 January 1906. Business was started on 20 June 1907.\n\nSometime during World War I (1914–1917) the bank was instructed to release notes of small denomination, for the first time, by the Federal Council of Switzerland.\n\nThe Federal Council devalued the Swiss Franc during 1936, and as a result there was made available to the National bank an amount of monies, which the bank subsequently stored in a Währungsausgleichsfonds reserve for use in future situations of emergency.\n\nIn 1981 the bank participated in research involving Orell Füssli and an optical research group named Landis and Gyr, on matters of banknote design.\n\nDuring 1994 the Bank was described as a joint-stock company acting under the administration and supervision of the Confederation. It had eight branches and twenty sub-branches within cantons. The governing board had overall executive management of the Nationalbank, with supervision entrusted to its shareholders, the banks' council, the banks' committee, its local committees and auditing committee. The three members of the governing board together decided the monetary policy of the Nationalbank. Towards the end of 1993 it had 566 employees.\n\nWith the inception of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, in May 2004, the Nationalbank achieved formal independence.\n\nApproximately 55% of the share capital is held by public shareholders (cantons, cantonal banks, etc.). The remaining shares are largely in the hands of private persons. Shares of the SNB have been listed at the SIX Swiss Exchange since 1907.\n\nThe SNB announced on 6 September 2011 to set a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro and that it would \"enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination and is prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities\" in order to take measures to stem the development of a possible recession. The bank stated the 1.20 exchange rate was defendable as the bank could potentially proceed to mint enough banknotes to control the rate sufficiently. The SNB announced on 15 January 2015 the Euro currency arrangement would end as the Euro crisis had passed and the Europeans would be making financial policy changes.\n\nThe basic governing principles of the Nationalbank are contained within Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, which deals with matters of monetary policy. There are three numbered factors concerning principles explicitly mentioning the Nationalbank, of four altogether shown within the Article. The SNB is therefore obliged by constitutional statute law to act in accordance with the economic interests of Switzerland. Accordingly, the prime function of the Nationalbank is:\n\nThe Nationalbank publishes within its own site a list of research done as work in progress by staff members, which begin at 2004 (2 papers), to 2005 (2), 2006 (11), 2007 (17), 2008 (19), 2009 (16), 2010 (19), 2011 (14), 2012 (16), 2013 (11), 2014 (13), and to 1 August 2015 there is shown nine papers, a list of eight economic studies which relate to the tasks of the bank, listed from 2005, in addition to a bi-annually published update of research, listed from 2012 to the present.\n\nThe National Bank is entrusted with the note-issuing privilege. It supplies the economy with banknotes that meet high standards with respect to quality and security. It is also charged by the Confederation with the task of coin distribution.\n\nIn the field of cashless payment transactions, the National Bank provides services for payments between banks. These are settled in the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system via sight deposit accounts held with the National Bank.\n\nThe National Bank manages currency reserves. These engender confidence in the Swiss franc, help to prevent and overcome crises and may be utilized for interventions in the foreign exchange market.\n\nThe National Bank contributes to the stability of the financial system by acting as an arbiter over monetary policy. Within the context of this task, it analyses sources of risk to the financial system, oversees systemically important payment and securities settlement systems and helps to promote an operational environment for the financial sector.\n\nTogether with the federal authorities, the National Bank participates in international monetary cooperation and provides technical assistance.\n\nThe National Bank acts as banker to the Swiss Confederation. It processes payments on behalf of the Confederation, issues money market debt register claims and bonds, handles the safekeeping of securities and carries out money market and foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThe National Bank compiles statistical data on banks and financial markets, the balance of payments, the international investment position and the Swiss financial accounts.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank invests its assets, particularly in the stock market. In 2018, its share portfolio stood at 153 billion Swiss francs.\n\nAccording to its guidelines, it \"avoids shares in companies which produce internationally banned weapons, seriously violate fundamental human rights or systematically cause severe environmental damage\".\n\nSince 2016, environmental associations and academics criticize the fact that these investments do not take into account the Paris Climate Agreement (article 2) and are responsible for at least 50 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2017.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank pursues a monetary policy serving the interests of the country as a whole. It must ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments.\nMonetary policy affects production and prices with a considerable time lag. Consequently, it is based on inflation forecasts rather than current inflation.\n\nThe SNB's monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability (the SNB equates price stability with a rise in the national consumer price index of less than 2% per year), a medium-term conditional inflation forecast, and, at operational level, a target range for a reference interest rate, which is the Libor for three-month investments in Swiss francs.\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders is held once a year, usually in April. Owing to the SNB's public mandate, the powers of the shareholders' meeting are not as extensive as in joint-stock companies under private law.\n\nThe Bank Council oversees and controls the conduct of business by the Swiss National Bank and consists of 11 members. Six members, including the President and Vice President, are appointed by the Federal Council, and five by the Shareholders' Meeting. The Bank Council sets up four committees from its own ranks: an Audit Committee, a Risk Committee, a Remuneration Committee and an Appointment Committee.\n\nA list of the Bank Council members is published on the SNB website (see: http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/snb/bodies/id/snb_bodies_council)\n\nThe Swiss National Bank's management and executive body is the Governing Board. The Governing Board is responsible in particular for monetary policy, asset management strategy, contributing to the stability of the financial system and international monetary cooperation. The Governing Board consists of 3 members:\n\n\n\nThe SNB manages the official gold reserves of Switzerland, which as of 2008 amount to 1145 tonnes and are valued at 30.5 billion CHF. The gold is believed to be stored in huge vaults beneath the Federal Square (\"Bundesplatz\") to the north of the federal Parliament building in Bern, but the SNB treats the location of the gold reserves as a secret. Independent confirmation of the gold's location was obtained by the Bernese newspaper \"Der Bund\" in 2008. It published a photograph of the bullion that a keystone photographer was allowed to take at the SNB premises in Bern in 2001. \"Der Bund\" also quoted a retired official of the city's surveying office as saying that the gold vaults take up an area of roughly half the Federal Square and have a depth of dozens of meters, down to the level of the Aar river. The SNB says that the gold reserves are stored in different safe places in Switzerland (70% -mostly under the Bundesplatz in Berne and at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel) and abroad (i.e. Bank of England and Bank of Canada).\n\nFrom the latter years of the 1990s until sometime during 2005, the Nationalbank transferred from its possession (incompetently, when the gold price was at its historic low) half of its gold reserves, following the Nazi gold affair.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank provided 1.2 billion CHF to the Reichsbank, of this, a value of approximately 780 million CHF of the gold given to the Nationalbank was gold which had been looted by the forces of Germany. In addition the Nationalbank also exchanged between 1.2–1.6 billion CHF for gold from the Allied forces. During 20 April 1944, gold from the gold reserves of Italy arrived from Como at the railway station within Chiasso.\n\nThere is controversy over the role of the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank \"must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries\". This was confirmed by the Swiss Bergier commission in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources, of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted. The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jews executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.\n\n\n"}

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Counts of Wurmbrand-Stuppach gained notability in wars against the Turks in the Balkans. The Counts of Wurmbrand-Stuppach were highly decorated advisors to the Habsburg Emperors. During the 18th century the family had immediate status as ruling counts of a small territory of the Holy Roman Empire and as such, the family belonged to high nobility.\n\nThe founding of the house of Wurmbrand-Stuppach, and the origins of the name, occurred during the Crusades. The Count of Stuppach had disappeared seven years earlier fighting in the Holy Land, and the knights were getting impatient on waiting for his wife and successor to remarry. A lindworm (a mythological two-legged wyvern-like creature) had entered the county and began to terrorise the land. The knights demanded she marry a brave nobleman to fight it.\n\nThe Countess asked for four weeks' delay, and when that time had passed she said to the knights \"I asked God. He likes my husband to return to me, if he still lives. To my sadness he did not come. Give me still four weeks period.\" But the people would not have another four weeks delay due to the lindworm, so she instead announced that she would marry whoever slayed the beast.\n\nSilently, the knights left. Those which went to slay the lindworm did not return. One day, a poor farmer was on the Burglach making fences when the lindworm appeared. It lunged at the farmer, which speared the lindworm in the mouth with a stake he was using to build the fences. Other farmers who were nearby saw it, and they carried him to the countess to be married. The wedding lasted a week.\n\nThe family is first mentioned with \"Leupold dem Wurmbrant\" in 1194. They originate from the Bucklige Welt region in Lower Austria. At the end of the 12th century they received the fief of Stuppach castle near Gloggnitz which remained in their possession until 1659.\nIn 1600, they acquired Steyersberg castle near Warth, Lower Austria.\n\nEhrenreich the Elder (1558- c. 1620) became baron in 1607. His children became counts in 1682. Count Johann Josef Wilhelm (1670–1750), president of the Aulic Council, was honored by the Emperor by being made a personal (not yet hereditary) member of the \"Franconian count's bench\", a part of the college of Imperial Princes (\"Reichsfürstenrat\" or \"Fürstenbank\") in the Imperial Diet in 1726. Upon his admission he had to promise to purchase some immediate territory on the first occasion, since all of the family's possessions had no such status as they were located within the Archduchy of Austria. Finally a splinter share of the immediate \"County of Limpurg\" was inherited by Johann Josef Wilhelm's wife Countess Juliane Dorothea von Limpurg-Gaildorf, a territory around its residence Gaildorf, Swabia, that had been divided between a large number of heirs when its former rulers, the Counts \"\" extinguished in 1713, leaving ten daughters. With this splinter share, the acquisition of a territory with Imperial Immediacy was fulfilled and the head of the family became a hereditary member of the \"Swabian count's bench\". The county of Limpurg was mediatized in 1806 and became part of the Kingdom of Württemberg. The Mediatized Houses however kept their princely status.\n\nThe elder branch extinguished with count Degenhard in 1965, and his only daughter Leonora inherited Steyersberg castle; it is now owned by her son Dr Paul Miller. The headship of the house went to count Ernst Gundaccar (b. 1946) of the younger branch, formerly residing at Liblín (Czech Republic). His mother, the heiress of Schloss Frohsdorf, was princess Blanca Massimo, daughter of princess Beatrix, herself a daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Frohsdorf castle was sold in 1941, but the estate is still owned by count Ernst Gundaccar who has two sons. Schloss Stubenberg in Styria was bought in 1815 and given to the Catholic Church in 1925 as a monastery, when two daughters took the veil.\nThe third branch resided at Reitenau castle near Stambach (1602-1822) and at Gornja Radgona Castle (1789-1914). In 1694 they purchased Altschielleiten castle at Stubenberg, Styria, where the new Schielleiten Palace was built from 1730. When this branch extinguished in 1906, the palace was inherited by the Marchese Tacoli family.\n\n\nIn 1806 the count of Wurmbrand-Stuppach was mediatised.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Considered one of the greatest composers of Polish Baroque music, during his lifetime he was called the \"Polish Handel\".\n\nBorn in Rozbark near Bytom in Silesia, then Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia around 1665, little is known of his early life. Similarly little is known about his musical education; however, it is known that he attended the University of Prague, where he graduated from the department of Liberal Arts and Philosophy, and then attended the University of Vienna, where he gained a licentiate in theology. He arrived in Kraków in 1689 or 1690, where he then attended the Catholic Seminary. He was ordained on 22 March 1692.\n\nFollowing his ordination, he was appointed to the academy for missionary priests in Chełmno in Pomerania, where he lectured in rhetoric and poetry, as well as conducting the local orchestra. After two years, he returned to Kraków, where he was appointed curate of the cathedral, and performed in the cathedral orchestra. He was appointed conductor on 10 January 1698, and remained in this position until his death on 30 April 1734.\n\nThe earliest recorded information on any of Gorczycki's works comes from 1694, but he must have written a substantial amount before 1698 in order to be appointed \"Kapellmeister.\" Unfortunately none of his compositions were ever published during his lifetime, so most of them have been lost; 39 works can, however, be attributed to him with surety.\n\nGorczycki wrote mainly church music: unaccompanied compositions for choir, sometimes with b.c. accompaniment in the \"stile antico\" (motets, masses, songs), as well as vocal-instrumental works with b.c. accompaniment in the \"stile moderno\" featuring rich, concertato technique, multi-sectional and verse sacred concertos as well as ensemble cantatas.\n\nGorczycki is regarded as an outstanding Polish composer of the high baroque. He used the most advanced achievements of the compositional techniques of the time.\n\nHis work is essentially divided into three strands:\n\nThese are works for 4 part choir, either \"a cappella\" or with small accompanying ensemble. It is here we see Gorczycki's mastery of counterpoint; he wrote masses, as well as arrangements of introits, antiphons, offertories and hymns which all belong to this category.\n\nExamples include:\n\nThis style was more popular at the time, as opposed to the Renaissance style of the above works. These works were composed for small ensemble and choir.\n\nExamples include:\n\nWhilst this section of his work is small, it is known that Gorczycki did write instrumental pieces; in 1962 evidence of a \"Ball Polonaise\" was discovered, however only a violin part remains. There is also evidence that the orchestra of Wieluń had Gorczycki's \"Ouverture ex D\" in its repertory.\n\n"}
{"id": "2332790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332790", "title": "Bewcastle Cross", "text": "Bewcastle Cross\n\nThe Bewcastle Cross is an Anglo-Saxon cross which is still in its original position within the churchyard of St Cuthbert's church at Bewcastle, in the English county of Cumbria. The cross, which probably dates from the 7th or early 8th century, features reliefs and inscriptions in the runic alphabet. The head of the cross is missing but the remains are 14.5 feet (4.4 metres) high, and almost square in section 22 x 21 1/4 inches (56 x 54 cm) at the base. The crosses of Bewcastle and Ruthwell have been described by the scholar Nikolaus Pevsner as \"the greatest achievement of their date in the whole of Europe\".\n\nThe cross is similar in many respects to the Ruthwell Cross, though the inscriptions are simpler, and seem to have a memorial function; together they are the largest and most elaborately decorated Anglo-Saxon crosses to have survived mostly intact, and they are generally discussed together.\n\nThe dating of both remains controversial, though Éamonn Ó Carragaáin, writing in 2007, says that \"although there is lively discussion about the dates of these monuments, there is a growing consensus that both are to be dated to the first half of the eighth century: as it were, to the “Age of Bede” (who died in 735) or to the generation after his death\"\n\nThere have been suggestions that neither cross was originally a single piece of stone completed in one phase of work, and both have been proposed as the earlier. The theory that the cross is probably the work of the team of masons and sculptors brought in by Benedict Biscop from the 670s to expand the monastery of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey, then one of the leading centres of culture in the Kingdom of Northumbria is still supported by the Bewcastle website; this reflects the dating of scholars such as Meyer Schapiro.\n\nEach of the four sides of the cross is intricately decorated with reliefs divided into panels depicting figures (west side only), animals, chequers, vine scrolls, interlace knots, as well as a sundial. The north, west, and south sides of the cross feature runic inscriptions. The largest relief on the side with figures is, as at Ruthwell, Christ treading on the beasts, below Saint John the Baptist. At the bottom, below a panel of runes, is a much-discussed figure of a falconer, who is possibly St. John the Evangelist with his eagle in an unusual depiction, possibly misunderstood from a Syrian model of John with an oil-lamp.\n\nThe sundial on its surface, a canonical sundial, \"is by far earliest English sundial to survive\", divided into the four 'tides' which governed the working day in medieval times.\n\nScholars have contended that only the name \"Cyneburh\" is definitely decipherable on the cross. Cyneburh was a wife of Aldfrith but this was a common name at the time and might not refer to Aldfrith's wife. Alfredir was king of Northumbria, and died around 664.\n\nThe north side contains runes that are not easily decipherable, but may refer to Wulfere, among others, who was a son of Penda, and king of Mercia.\n\nThe inscription on the west side has been read as: \n\n\"\"thissig be(a)cn thun set(t)on hwa(e)tred waethgar alwfwolthu aft alcfrithu ean kuining eac oswiuing gebid heo sinna sawhula\"\"\n\"\"This slender pillar Hwætred, Wæthgar, and Alwfwold set up in memory of Alcfrith, a king and son of Oswiu. Pray for their sins, their souls\".\"\nReferring to Egfrid, son of Oswy and brother of Alhfrith (also Alchfrith or Ealhfrith), who ascended to the throne in 670, the south side inscription has been read as:\n\n\"\"In the first year (of the reign) of Egfrid, king of this kingdom [Northumbria]\".\"\nA replica of the cross, including a guess at the missing part, is in the churchyard of the neo-Romanesque St Mary's Church at Wreay near Carlisle. The Wreay cross differs in style and detail from the original and has been described as a \"reinvention\".\n\n\n"}

H. Foley, was an Irish sculptor, working in London. he is best known for his statues of Daniel O'Connell in Dublin, and of Prince Albert for the Albert Memorial in London.\n\nFoley was born 24 May 1818, at 6 Montgomery Street, Dublin, in what was then the city's artists' quarter. The street has since been renamed Foley Street in his honour. His father was a glass-blower and his step-grandfather Benjamin Schrowder was a sculptor. At the age of thirteen he began to study drawing and modelling at the Royal Dublin Society, where he took several first-class prizes. In 1835 he was admitted as a student in the schools of the Royal Academy in London. He exhibited there for the first time in 1839, and came to fame in 1844 with his \"Youth at a Stream\". Thereafter commissions provided a steady career for the rest of his life. In 1849 he was made an associate, and in 1858 a full member of the Royal Academy of Art.\n\nWhen, in 1851, inspired by the recently closed Great Exhibition, the Corporation of London voted a sum of £10,000 to be spent on sculpture to decorate the Egyptian Hall in the Mansion House, Foley was commissioned to make sculptures of \"Caractacus\" and \"Egeria\".\n\nIn 1864 he was chosen to sculpt one of the four large stone groups, each representing a continent, at the corners of George Gilbert Scott's Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens. His design for \"Asia\" was approved in December of that year. In 1868, Foley was also asked to make the bronze statue of Prince Albert himself, to be placed at the centre of the memorial, following the death of Carlo Marochetti, who had originally received the commission, but had struggled to produce an acceptable version.\n\nFoley exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1839 and 1861. Further works were shown posthumously in 1875. His address is given in the catalogues as 57, George St., Euston Square, London until 1845, and 19, Osnaburgh Street from 1847.\n\nFoley died at Hampstead, north London on 27 August 1874, and was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral on 4 September. He left his models to the Royal Dublin Society, where he had his early artistic education, and a large part of his property to the Artists' Benevolent Fund. He did not see the Albert Memorial completed before his death. A statue of Foley himself, on the front of the Victoria and Albert Museum, depicts him as a rather gaunt figure with a moustache, wearing a floppy cap.\n\nFoley's pupil Thomas Brock brought several of Foley's works to completion after his death, including his statue of Prince Albert for the Albert Memorial.\n\nFoley's articled pupil and later studio assistant Francis John Williamson became a successful sculptor in his own right, reputed to have been Queen Victoria's favourite. Other pupils and assistants were Charles Bell Birch, Samuel Ferris Lynn, Charles Lawes, and Richard Belt.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, a number of Foley's works were removed, or destroyed without notice, because the persons portrayed were considered hostile to the process of Irish independence. They included those of Lord Carlisle, Lord Dunkellin (in Galway) and Field Marshal Gough in the Phoenix Park. The statue of Lord Dunkellin was decapitated and dumped in the river as one of the first acts of the short-lived \"Galway Soviet\" of 1922.\n\n\"See also Works at Wikimedia Commons\"\n\nHis most notable works include:\n\nIn London:\n\nIn Ireland:\n\nElsewhere:\n\nThe Hereford Times makes special mention of John Henry Foley on 24 May 1873 in the published memoriam of Victorian era artist, Charles Lucy: \"Mr. Foley, the eminent sculptor, has taken a cast of the head and face of the deceased, whose fine expressive features are described as singularly beautiful in death.\" However, whether Mr. Foley made a sculpture from this cast remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n"}

The public image of Canada's armed forces took a \"severe beating\" in 1993. Canadian soldiers committed abusive behaviour, including racism, torture and murder in Somalia in March 1993 (two months prior to Gunther's killing in Bosnia). The Canadian political issue known as the Somalia Affair eventually lead the Jean Chrétien government to call a public inquiry in 1994. he resulting investigation affected all levels of the Department of National Defence. The public also responded to surveys released in 1993 also showed that soldiers were resistant to openly homosexual soldiers and that 26.5 per cent of female personnel reported sexual harassment.\n\nThe scandals contributed to increased debate about Canada's management of its armed forces, public accountability and participation in active war zones such as Bosnia. A parliamentary committee examined and wrote a report on the issue of peacekeeping missions in increasingly dangerous conflicts.\n\nCanada's role and management of peacekeeping units was an active topic for defence minister Kim Campbell who was competing to replace Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Gunther's death occurred two days after Mulroney's last appearance in the House of Commons and seven days prior to Campbell's first day as Prime Minister.\n\nMedia relations was a challenge for the Canadian Forces in this decade due to a number of military scandals, the growing complexity of their missions, and the newer model of in-the-field broadcast journalism (sometimes referred to as the \"CNN Era\") that required more media relations on the ground and could have a rapid impact on news and politics in the home country.\n\nCritics of the military believed the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces attempted to minimize the negative impacts on public opinion in order to avoid being forced to scale back its participation in increasingly violent peacekeeping missions. Canadian historian, and former head of the Canadian War Museum, Jack Granatstein has cited Gunther's death as an example of a general policy by defense headquarters to limit publicizing details.\n\nAbout a month after being assigned to Bosnia, Gunther was driving a UN-marked M113 armored personnel carrier (APC) in Buci, a village with high tension between Muslims and Croats that was about 20 kilometres northwest of Sarajevo on June 18, 1993.\n\nAt 12:40, just 40 minutes after a ceasefire was supposed to start at noon, Gunther stood up to look out the front of his APC, with his captain and sergeant at the back. The sun was directly overhead as he surveyed the land through binoculars. He saw a line of tracer fire arcing across the sky and when he turned to call out his report, a shot sounded from a nearby building. An anti-tank rocket, most probably an 82-millimeter Recoilless rifle, burst through Daniel's chest, and his head was torn from his body.\n\nA ceasefire between the Serbian, Croatian and Muslim forces was agreed upon to start at noon on June 18. The killing of Gunther occurred 40 minutes after the ceasefire began. The Bosnian army claimed he was killed by a Serb mortar round. The United Nations would not comment on the details of the killing or which side was responsible, which led to questions whether they were limiting public comments in order to avoid disrupting negotiations between the parties.\n\nCanadian officials also did not identify which group was responsible for the killing. Eventually, the rocket was attributed to Muslim militiamen.\n\nThe manner of his killing was inaccurately reported by the military to the public and Gunther's family which eventually caused a controversy in Canada.\n\nImmediately following his death, an incident report stating that he was the victim of a \"deliberate attack by an anti-tank rocket\" was sent to the National Defense Headquarters in Ottawa. The report was received within six hours of the incident and was in a daily briefing package for the deputy minister. The military's initial position was that Gunther was likely killed unintentionally by shrapnel from a distant mortar and that, as a new peacekeeper, he may have exposed himself by being outside the protection of his vehicle. The military's press release that evening read, \"Corporal Daniel Gunther ... was killed today when a mortar bomb fell close to his vehicle.\" A public-affairs officer also added, \"Corporal Gunther was probably halfway out of his vehicle when he was hit by shrapnel.\"\n\nBecause of the inaccurate publicity, some news publications were led to speculate whether the M113 APC was obsolete and unsafe for use in peacekeeping missions.\n\nThe conclusion of the incident report was justified by a unanimous, but classified, conclusions of an internal board of inquiry that were not made public until after it became a controversy. The official military account wasn't publicly challenged until December 1993, six months after the incident and two months after Kim Campbell's landslide election-loss. Two soldiers anonymously notified Scott Taylor, iconoclastic publisher of military watchdog magazine \"Esprit de Corps\", that the military knew that Gunther's killing was intentional but continued to avoid correcting their initial position to both the public and even to Gunther's family. The soldiers stated that it was an anti-tank rocket that had killed Gunther, implying it had not been a simple misfortune, but a deliberately aimed warhead that killed the Corporal driving a marked UN Peacekeeping vehicle.\n\nTaylor fed the tips to Peter Worthington of the \"Toronto Sun\" to bring the soldiers' accounts into the public eye.\n\nThe Ministry of National Defence attributed the error to initial information provided from the war zone.\n\n\"Esprit de Corps\" subsequently published a number of critical articles about the issue in the magazine and in books co-authored by Taylor.\n\nAfter the hostile nature of Gunther's killing became a controversy, some questioned whether Kim Campbell's campaign was a factor in downplaying the facts about his death. It was later demonstrated that she was not informed about the hostile nature of his death.\n\nGunther belonged to a military family. His father Peter Gunther was a Captain (who eventually spent 37 years in the military) and his maternal grandfather retired as a Sergeant. Daniel Gunther was born in Germany while his father was assigned to a military base there. In 1987, the year after he and his parents moved back to Montreal in the suburb of Brossard, Daniel Gunther enlisted in the army.\n\nIn April 1993, Daniel was placed on standby for duty in Bosnia. In May, he was assigned to Bosnia selected as an emergency reinforcement to replace an injured soldier in Bosnia, leaving his wife Marie-Josée Vincent and his ten-month-old son Alexandre in Quebec.\n\nIn addition to the perceived lengthy cover-up of the real nature of Gunther's killing, some slights by the military contributed to Gunther's parents criticizing the military publicly. In a period of time when Internet usage was somewhat novel, the family created webpages to honour and advocate for their son's memory.\n\nSince he had a one-year-old child, Gunther tried to amend his armed forces supplementary insurance policy from $100,000 to $250,000 prior to his departure to Bosnia. His unit, anxious to get him overseas immediately, told him he could do that once he got to Bosnia. He was killed days after he arrived and before he could make the necessary changes to his policy. The army commander, Lieutenant-General Baril, later admitted that Gunther had been given insufficient time to prepare for his tour but, without a signature, the policy stood at $100,000.\nInstead of providing in person the Silver Cross, an award given to families of all service personnel killed overseas, the military sent it to Gunther's mother by mail and it was tarnished, not new. When Gunther's mother went to the following year's Remembrance Day ceremony in Quebec City to lay a bouquet of flowers in her son's honour, she was denied access until after the ceremony had ended.\n\nSome years later, the military announced that Gunther's mother would be the Memorial Cross Mother who would lay flowers at the National Peacekeeping Monument during the Peacekeeping Day Ceremony on October 22, 2000. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Maurice Baril, also presented the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal to his widow, son, father and grandfather.\n\nGunther was posthumously awarded the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal and was mentioned in Roméo Dallaire's award-winning novel \"Shake Hands with the Devil\".\n\nCanadian Forces documents about circumstances surrounding his death are preserved in the National Defence Headquarters Directorate of History and Heritage.\n\n"}

The parish population taken at the 2011 census was 2,468.\n\nIt contains Imjin Barracks, the home of Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, which moved from Germany in 2010. Until 2008, it was best known for RAF Innsworth, the home of the RAF Personnel and Training Command, before its move to RAF High Wycombe to co-locate with RAF Strike Command, forming RAF Air Command.\n\nInnsworth like its neighbouring village, Churchdown, is split into two halves: the military housing side which ends at the junction of Ward Avenue and Swallow Crescent and also Thompson Way again with Swallow Crescent.\n\nMany of the housing association homes in Innsworth were either prefabricated, or rapidly built \"no fines\" structures, as was common in the mid- to late-1940s after the Second World War. The former were only intended to remain standing for two decades, they have now been up for close to 70 years. The majority have had the original prefabricated concrete removed and been refaced with two modern brick walls, some of the distinctive Wimpey and prefab houses still remain. Also in common with many developments at this time, these houses and bungalows are all on roads named according to a theme, in this case they are after birds. New housing developments in the village have followed the tradition with Tern Court at the north of Rookery Road and also Falcon Close 100 yards down the Rookery Road.\n\nInnsworth also used to be home to a local pub called The Bullfinch, known locally as \"The Bully\". The Bully was closed in late 2004 and knocked down in 2010/2011, to be replaced with social housing by the Severn Vale Housing Society. The old sign for the pub can still be found at the top of Bullfinch Way and its junction with Innsworth Lane.\n\nFollowing the Tewkesbury (Electoral Changes) Order 2018 the village falls in the 'Innsworth' electoral ward. This ward stretches between Twigworth, Innsworth and Longford. Two councillors represent the ward. \n\nIn 2016 3110 electors lived in the Innsworth ward. This is expected to grow to 3885 by 2022.\n\nThe village now has its own Community Hall on Rookery Road next to the Junior School, which is home to the village youth club and also to the bingo club which is held every Sunday evening and also many Severnvale Housing Association drop-in clinics. The village campaigned for many years to the local H/A and Borough Council for the Hall.\n\n"}

However, a conference in London in 1885 encouraged him to instead become a missionary. He was appointed a missionary in 1886, left the United Kingdom for China in 1887, and was posted to Yunnan province in 1888. He remained in China, as a missionary, until his death from typhoid.\n\nIn 1891 he was posted to a newly opened Bible Christian mission station in Zhaotong (referred to in contemporary sources in Wade–Giles as Chaotung), where he married Emmie Hainge. He began a Christian movement with the Big Flowery Miao in 1905 that spread to Zhaotong. Pollard also invented a script for the Miao languages called the Pollard Script (also sometimes called the \"Ahmao script\"). He credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabary, \"While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by James Evans, a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done\". He also gave credit to a non-Miao Chinese pastor, “Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system”.\n\nPollard never claimed any divine inspiration or vision in creating the script. Rather, he left a record of hard work, advice from others, and ideas from other scripts. At the beginning, he wrote, he “made an experiment in getting out a written language for the Miao”, even writing out some symbols in his diary. He credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabary (discussed above), “While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done”. He also gave credit to a Chinese pastor, “Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system”. In another document he wrote “Mr. Stephen Lee and I are attempting to reduce the Miao language to a simply system of writing. The attempt may succeed or it may end… stillborn”. He asked himself in his diary “How shall I manage to distinguish tones?” then later wrote how he had found the solution, adopting an idea from Pitman’s shorthand. In listing the phrases he used to describe the process of creating the script, there is clear indication of work, not revelation: “we looked about”, “working out the problem”, “resolved to attempt”, “assisted”, “at last we arrived at a system”, “adapting the system”, “we found”, “solved our problem”. In all of this, we see no hint of specific revelation or any vision, only intellectual labor.\n\nHe used it to translate the New Testament. The script was unique in the fact that it used the initial consonant of a syllable, with the vowel placed above or below it, in order to indicate which tone the vowel was.\n\nPollard received pressure from some British sources that if the Roman script was not suitable, he should consider using the Burmese alphabet. He did not accept this suggestions, but Pollard did leave the door open for switching over to Roman letters, writing in 1906, \"It is quite possible later on to turn our system into Romanised, where there is a successful Romanised system in use which will solve the tone difficulty\". A large part of Pollard’s motivation for creating his script was to have a way to adequately mark the sounds of the language, especially the tones. It has remained in use for 90 years, despite efforts to supersede it.\n\nDuring his mission he travelled extensively, founding churches, training other missionaries, performing the role of language examiner, and arguing the causes of Miao Christians.\n\nAfter Pollard's death in 1915, he was buried in the mountains near the Shimenkan mission station, contemporary Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County. The mission prospered for another 35 years until 1950, when the CCP ordered all English missionaries to cease proselytizing and leave the country. His grave and the county were closed to foreigners until 1995, when Xinhua announced that work had been taken to restore Pollard's tomb which they now declared to be a national monument.\n\nThe main building at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center in Nanjing, China is known as the Samuel Pollard Building. It houses the Center's library, classrooms and conference space, and administration offices.\n\nThe building was dedicated in 2007 as part of the Center's twentieth anniversary celebrations, which included keynotes by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was initially active at the court of Samuel Zborowski, between 1583 and 1585 also at the royal court of Stefan Batory.\n\nZborowski, Długoraj's first master, was so cruel that the lutenist fled his court. He found employment with a new master who treated him well, but was discovered and compelled to resume his duties with Zborowski. Długoraj was able to escape his plight when he found incriminating letters of his master's, which he transmitted to the king via Jan Zamoyski. Zborowski was eventually executed, but Długoraj was forced to flee to Germany for fear of Zborowski's heirs, who swore revenge. He apparently lived out his years abroad.\n\nDługoraj is notable for a number of fantasies, villanellas and dances. A large number of his works have been preserved in lute manuscripts.\n\n\n"}
