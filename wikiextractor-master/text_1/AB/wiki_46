He is a former member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for the Country Liberal Party.\n\nElferink was born in the Netherlands and moved to Australia with his parents and older siblings as a three year old in 1968. His family settled in Darwin, and he subsequently graduated from Casuarina High School.\n\nIn 1983, Elferink joined the Northern Territory Police as a cadet. He subsequently rose to the rank of Sergeant (Qualified to Senior Sergeant), and served in both Darwin and Alice Springs. While in the police force, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University in 1997, completing the course by distance education. In 2008 Elferink graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the University of New England. He was admitted to the bar in October 2009.\n\nIn 1997, Elferink won Country Liberal preselection for the rural electorate of MacDonnell after incumbent Labor member Neil Bell announced his retirement. On paper, Elferink faced daunting odds; the ALP held the seat with a majority of 16 points. However, the ALP preselected union organiser Mark Wheeler, thus prompting indigenous leader Kenneth Lechleitner to run as an independent and direct his preferences to the CLP. \nElferink picked up enough of Leichleitner's preferences to take the seat on a swing of 18.7 percent. Although a redistribution ahead of the 2001 election erased Elferink's majority and made Macdonnell a notional Labor seat, Elferink was re-elected even as a massive swing to Labor across the Territory allowed it to win government for the first time. He served in the Shadow Ministry under Opposition Leaders Denis Burke and Terry Mills.\n\nElferink became an increasingly prominent member of the shadow ministry during his first two years in a portfolio. However, by early 2003, Elferink became increasingly frustrated with Burke's leadership who was struggling to maintain his grip on the party at the time. In June 2003, Elferink resigned as Shadow Minister for Local Government and Indigenous Affairs and publicly slammed Burke's leadership, labelling him \"arrogant\" and calling for him to be replaced by rival Mills.\n\nHe later returned to the shadow ministry in September, taking on the portfolio of Police, Fire and Emergency Services.\n\nBy late 2004, Elferink was once again becoming a key member of the parliamentary party, and this was reflected when, on 12 October, he was made Opposition Whip. Elferink was subsequently rewarded for this support, being made Leader of Opposition Business and Shadow Minister for Community Development, Housing, Local Government, Sport and Recreation, Regional Development and Indigenous Affairs, while maintaining the position of Whip. Elferink stood for re-election at the 2005 election. However, facing star candidate and indigenous activist Alison Anderson, Elferink was heavily defeated, suffering a two-party swing of 20.6 percent. He later served as party director for the CLP.\n\nIn the years between his occupation of a seat in parliament, Elferink occasionally worked for the Centre for Democratic Institutions in the Pacific on a number of occasions. Working to help improve the democracies of Fiji and the Solomon Islands.\n\nElferink contested the seat of Port Darwin at 9 August 2008 Legislative Assembly general election, and defeated Labor Party incumbent Kerry Sacilotto. In opposition, he held the Shadow portfolios of Shadow Treasurer, Shadow Minister for Public Employment, Shadow Minister for Essential Services as well as being the Leader of Opposition Business in the Territory Assembly.\n\nWhen the CLP won the 2012 Northern Territory election, Elferink was made a minister in the Mills Ministry: Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, and Minister for Correctional Services. On 6 March, he was given the additional portfolios of Treasurer and Corporate and Information Services. For two years, he served in cabinet alongside Anderson, who crossed the floor to the CLP in 2011, but was dropped from the cabinet in 2013.\n\nElferink had courted controversy on a number of occasions with his hands on approach to involving himself in domestic violence occurrences being facetiously labelled \"Captain Justice\", by local press because of his propensity to personally intervene in domestic violence incidents when they occurred, on one occasion being assaulted himself in defence of domestic violence victim.\n\nAs Attorney General Elferink also embarked on an ambitious campaign of court reform in the Territory culminating in the abolition of the Magistrates Court and the effective introduction of a three tier court system in the Northern Territory giving quazi-judicial powers to the NT Civil Appeals Tribunal. These steps were welcomed by the legal fraternity of the Northern Territory. Further reforms included the construction of the new Supreme Court Building in Alice Springs and the introduction of the Children's Court in Darwin.\n\nFurther components of Elferink's Attorney Generalship included his personal drafting of the Pillars of Justice reform package. These changes were the most fundamental shake up of the Department of Justice and Attorney General since self-government, putting the structures in place that were necessary to form the basis of the future course of the justice system in the Northern Territory.\n\nElferink also introduced \"No Body No Parole\" laws in the NT, which prevents a convicted murderer from receiving parole when that murderer refused to identify the location of the body to authorities. An example of this in the Northern Territory was Bradley John Murdoch, who had been convicted of the murder of Peter Falconio but never revealed the location of the body.\n\nElferink also introduced controversial 'paperless arrest' laws that saw a substantial fall in the number of assaults occurring in the Darwin CBD. The laws were challenged in the High Court of Australia with the court ruling that the laws were not punitive in nature and were lawful. Throughout his time in parliament Elferink remained a strident critic of passive welfare and its effects. The paperless arrest system was in part a response to the negative impact and overwhelming anti-social behaviour which plagued the Northern Territory.\n\nAs Health Minister Elferink was tasked with commencing the long delayed Palmerston Hospital. Shortly after taking the portfolio Elferink had brought the Territory Government to a position where the Hospital was commenced under Elferink's stewardship.\n\nMental Health issues also were of deep concern to Elferink who took a number of steps to improve mental health services in the Northern Territory including the jurisdictions first mental health ward for juveniles. The court system was also supported with the addition of mental health workers as Court Clinicians. Elferink drove the introduction of the Northern Territory's first suicide action plan in an effort to reduce the Territory's tragically high suicide rate.\n\nAfter supporting Willem Westra van Holthe's attempted party-room coup against Giles on 2 February, Elferink was named deputy leader of the CLP, putting him on track to become Deputy Chief Minister. This challenge was brought undone less than a day later, but Elferink remained in cabinet.\n\nOn 18 November 2015, Elferink announced that he would retire at the next election to be held in August 2016.\n\nAfter announcing his retirement Elferink continued to pursue development for the NT in the surprising area of satellite launching capability with an Australian investor who wanted to buy the Sea Launch facility at Long Beach and bring it to Darwin. Elferink led the Northern Territory Government's mission in the negotiation processes.\n\nJohn Elferink is credited with substantial advances in the NT Corrections system, introducing the Northern Territory Corrections Industry banner and the Sentenced to a Job program that saw prisoners trained and skilled ready for the work place which they entered while still serving time. Chief Minister Adam Giles subsequently stated Elferink's role in prison reform should be applauded.\n\nOn 25 July 2016, footage of abuse to children as young as 13 years old within Darwin's Don Dale Youth Corrections Centre was aired in a Four Corners exclusive on the ABC. When Elferink was asked about the incidents by Four Corners journalists, he stated, in relation to the boy in the footage, Dylan Voller, that \"Where there has even been a suggestion of criminality we've looked at it. Unfortunately these kids come into the system, these juveniles come into the system pre-broken and we have to cope with them, particularly when they are violent.\" The release of the footage resulted in the appointment of the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory and the dismissal of Elferink as Corrections Minister on 26 July. He nevertheless retained all his other portfolios.\n\nSubsequent to Elferink's removal from the role, Chief Minister Adam Giles described his decision to remove him as the \"...wrong decision...\" citing Elferink's hard work in the corrections field and accusing the ABC's Four Corners program of bias.\n\nAs a result of the Royal Commission no criminal charges were brought to bear against any individual. Elferink's criticism of the ABC's 4 Corners program became more pointed as a result as 4 Corners had alleged torture and barbarism. “We have acted and always acted when in government with absolute probity, something 4 Corners had explained to them at length, something they chose not to run with and as a consequence they put out a story saying that we tortured children, that we acted with barbarism in our hearts and it made comparisons to Abu Ghraib,” Mr Elferink said.\n“All of those things are indictable offences, none of that was found to be true.”\n\nFormer Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett said that he believed that Elferink was the best Corrections Minister he'd ever encountered in politics.\n\nElferink had ordered that Don Dale be shut down in 2014 and detainees were moved into a new facility. This was a direct response to the Vita review and incidents in the Don Dale facility. Elferink publicly released the Vita review without any legal demand that he do so in the interest of full disclosure. In 2013 Elferink had also attempted to introduce international inspectors into the Northern Territory Corrections system by introducing legislation to ratify OPCAT (Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture). In 2016 he was forced to withdraw the bill from the House as the Federal Parliament had failed to ratify their part of the arrangement.\n\nIn October 2018 the Parole Board of the NT reported Elferink's reform programs continued to bear fruit. The COMMIT program which Elferink championed and drove was recognised by the Parole Board of the NT as being a significant contributor to prisoner rehabilitation in the NT.\n\nThroughout his political career Elferink remained open about the sexual abuse he'd suffered as a child. He always maintained his openness because he wanted to show people that a fully productive life was possible in spite of the challenges that people had to cope with from childhood. Elferink maintained the belief that waiting for perpetrator to apologise was to give that perpetrator ongoing power. \"The moment you say to another person, 'I cannot be happy or complete until you apologise', you have given away your ability to be happy and handed it to a third party.\" he said.\n\nIn 2015 Mr Elferink, then NT Attorney-General, reportedly told a Labor politician during a parliamentary debate he was \"really tempted to give her a slap right now, figuratively speaking,\". Mr Elferink apologised for his reaction saying the comment was \"unwise\" and only expressed it in the figurative sense meaning a rebuke.\n\nElferink is married to Dee Elferink and has two daughters Eleanor and Gwenevere. He enjoys riding his Royal Enfield motorbike in his leisure time.\n"}
{"id": "1972328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972328", "title": "Real estate bubble", "text": "Real estate bubble\n\nA real estate bubble or property bubble (or housing bubble for residential markets) is a type of economic bubble that occurs periodically in local or global real estate markets, and typically follow a land boom. A land boom is the rapid increase in the market price of real property such as housing until they reach unsustainable levels and then decline. This period, during the run up to the crash, is also known as froth. The questions of whether real estate bubbles can be identified and prevented, and whether they have broader macroeconomic significance, are answered differently by schools of economic thought, as detailed below.\n\nBubbles in housing markets are more critical than stock market bubbles. Historically, equity price busts occur on average every 13 years, last for 2.5 years, and result in about 4 percent loss in GDP. Housing price busts are less frequent, but last nearly twice as long and lead to output losses that are twice as large (IMF World Economic Outlook, 2003). A recent laboratory experimental study also shows that, compared to financial markets, real estate markets involve longer boom and bust periods. Prices decline slower because the real estate market is less liquid.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 was related to the bursting of real estate bubbles that had begun in various countries during the 2000s.\n\nAs with all types of economic bubbles, disagreement exists over whether or not a real estate bubble can be identified or predicted, then perhaps prevented. Speculative bubbles are persistent, systematic and increasing deviations of actual prices from their fundamental values. Bubbles can often be hard to identify, even after the fact, due to difficulty in accurately estimating intrinsic values.\n\nIn real estate, fundamentals can be estimated from rental yields (where real estate is then considered in a similar vein to stocks and other financial assets) or based on a regression of actual prices on a set of demand and/or supply variables.\n\nWithin mainstream economics, it can be posed that real estate bubbles cannot be identified as they occur and cannot or should not be prevented, with government and central bank policy rather cleaning up after the bubble bursts.\n\nAmerican economist Robert Shiller of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index of home prices in 20 metro cities across the United States indicated on May 31, 2011 that a \"Home Price Double Dip [is] Confirmed\" and British magazine \"The Economist,\" argue that housing market indicators can be used to identify real estate bubbles. Some argue further that governments and central banks can and should take action to prevent bubbles from forming, or to deflate existing bubbles.\n\nWithin mainstream economics, economic bubbles, and in particular real estate bubbles, are not considered major concerns. Within some schools of heterodox economics, by contrast, real estate bubbles are considered of critical importance and a fundamental cause of financial crises and ensuing economic crises.\n\nThe pre-dominating economic perspective is that increases in housing prices result in little or no wealth effect, namely it does not affect the consumption behavior of households not looking to sell. The house price becoming compensation for the higher implicit rent costs for owning. Increasing house prices can have a negative effect on consumption through increased rent inflation and a higher propensity to save given expected rent increase.\n\nIn some schools of heterodox economics, notably Austrian economics and Post-Keynesian economics, real estate bubbles are seen as an example of credit bubbles (pejoratively, speculative bubbles), because property owners generally use borrowed money to purchase property, in the form of mortgages. These are then argued to cause financial and hence economic crises. This is first argued empirically – numerous real estate bubbles have been followed by economic slumps, and it is argued that there is a cause-effect relationship between these.\n\nThe Post-Keynesian theory of debt deflation takes a demand-side view, arguing that property owners not only feel richer but borrow to (i) consume against the increased value of their property – by taking out a home equity line of credit, for instance; or (ii) speculate by buying property with borrowed money in the expectation that it will rise in value. When the bubble bursts, the value of the property decreases but not the level of debt. The burden of repaying or defaulting on the loan depresses aggregate demand, it is argued, and constitutes the proximate cause of the subsequent economic slump.\n\nIn attempting to identify bubbles before they burst, economists have developed a number of financial ratios and economic indicators that can be used to evaluate whether homes in a given area are fairly valued. By comparing current levels to previous levels that have proven unsustainable in the past (\"i.e.\" led to or at least accompanied crashes), one can make an educated guess as to whether a given real estate market is experiencing a bubble. Indicators describe two interwoven aspects of housing bubble: a valuation component and a debt (or leverage) component. The valuation component measures how expensive houses are relative to what most people can afford, and the debt component measures how indebted households become in buying them for home or profit (and also how much exposure the banks accumulate by lending for them). A basic summary of the progress of housing indicators for U.S. cities is provided by \"Business Week\". See also: real estate economics and real estate trends.\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of house \"price\" are also used in identifying housing bubbles; these are known as house price indices (HPIs).\n\nA noted series of HPIs for the United States are the Case–Shiller indices, devised by American economists Karl Case, Robert J. Shiller, and Allan Weiss. As measured by the Case–Shiller index, the US experienced a housing bubble peaking in the second quarter of 2006 (2006 Q2).\n\nThe crash of the Japanese asset price bubble from 1990 on has been very damaging to the Japanese economy. The crash in 2005 affected Shanghai, China's largest city.\n\n, real estate bubbles had existed in the recent past or were widely believed to still exist in many parts of the world, especially in Austria, the United States, Malta, Argentina, Britain, Jamaica, Micronesia, Ethiopia, Netherlands, Italy, Equatorial Guinea, Monaco, Turkey, Faroe Islands, Brazil, Denmark, Sweden, Philippines, Fiji, Dominica, Iceland, Nauru, Greenland, Liechtenstein, Canada, Germany, Portugal, New Zealand, Zaire, Latvia, Ireland, Spain, Sri Lanka, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Lebanon, Japan, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Luxembourg, Bangladesh, Tuvalu, Andorra, Azerbaijan, Jordan, Oman, Venezuela, Mexico, Gibraltar, Poland, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Israel, Greece, Outer Mongolia, Mozambique, Bahamas, Mali, El Salvador, Botswana, Algeria, Laos, Yemen, Bulgaria, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, North Korea, Baltic States, Thailand, Swaziland, India, Hong Kong, Romania, Zimbabwe, Vatican City, Ukraine, China and Croatia. Then U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in mid-2005 that \"at a minimum, there's a little 'froth' (in the U.S. housing market) … it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles.\" The \"Economist\" magazine, writing at the same time, went further, saying \"the worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history\". \nIn France, the economist Jacques Friggit publishes each year a study called \"Evolution of the price, value and number of property sales in France since the 19th century\", showing a high price increase since 2001. Yet, the existence of a real estate bubble in France is discussed by economists. \nReal estate bubbles are invariably followed by severe price decreases (also known as a house price crash) that can result in many owners holding mortgages that exceed the value of their homes. 11.1 million residential properties, or 23.1% of all U.S. homes, were in negative equity at Dec. 31, 2010. Commercial property values remained around 35% below their mid-2007 peak in the United Kingdom. As a result, banks have become less willing to hold large amounts of property-backed debt, likely a key issue affecting the worldwide recovery in the short term.\n\nBy 2006, most areas of the world were thought to be in a bubble state, although this hypothesis, based upon the observation of similar patterns in real estate markets of a wide variety of countries, was subject to controversy. Such patterns include those of overvaluation and, by extension, excessive borrowing based on those overvaluations.\nThe U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2010, alongside its impacts and effects on economies in various nations, has implied that these trends might have some common characteristics.\n\nFor individual countries, see:\n\n\"The Washington Post\" writer Lisa Sturtevant thinks that the housing market of 2013 was not indicative of a housing bubble. \"A critical difference between the current market and the overheated market of the middle of last decade is the nature of the mortgage market. Stricter underwriting standards have limited the pool of potential homebuyers to those who are most qualified and most likely to be able to pay loans back. The demand this time is based more closely on market fundamentals. And the price growth we’ve experienced recently is 'real.' Or 'more real.'\" Other recent research indicates that mid-level managers in securitized finance did not exhibit awareness of problems in overall housing markets.\n\nEconomist David Stockman believes that a second housing bubble was started in 2012 and still inflating as of February 2013. Housing inventory began to dwindle starting in early 2012 as hedge fund investors and private equity firms purchase single-family homes in hopes of renting them out while waiting for a housing rebound. Due to the policies of QE3, mortgage interest rates have been hovering at an all-time low, causing real estate values to rise. Home prices have risen unnaturally as much as 25% within one year in metropolitan areas like the San Francisco Bay Area and Las Vegas.\n\n\n"}

Aside from the original thick stone walls, the building demonstrates some architectural features common to Irish fortifications of the period (including a murder-hole), and some less common features (including a Sheela na gig).\n\nThe castle remained under continuous occupation and ownership by the (Mac)Egan families until it was confiscated and burned at the time of the Cromwellian conquest c.1650.\nThe site remained in ruin for over 300 years, with only the thick exterior walls standing, until Michael J. Egan, a Mayo lawyer, purchased and renovated the building in 1972. While the castle remains a private residence, terms of the Department of Finance \"Heritage/Cultural Tax Relief\" mean the castle is periodically open to the public during the summer months. It is a protected structure (ref S329) on the North Tipperary list of protected structures.\n\nThe castle hosted several \"Clan Egan\" rallies in 2000, 2004 and 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "1972332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972332", "title": "Scattering parameters", "text": "Scattering parameters\n\nScattering parameters or S-parameters (the elements of a scattering matrix or S-matrix) describe the electrical behavior of linear electrical networks when undergoing various steady state stimuli by electrical signals.\n\nThe parameters are useful for several branches of electrical engineering, including electronics, communication systems design, and especially for microwave engineering.\n\nThe S-parameters are members of a family of similar parameters, other examples being: Y-parameters, Z-parameters, H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters. They differ from these, in the sense that \"S-parameters\" do not use open or short circuit conditions to characterize a linear electrical network; instead, matched loads are used. These terminations are much easier to use at high signal frequencies than open-circuit and short-circuit terminations. Contrary to popular belief, the quantities are not measured in terms of power (except in now-obsolete six-port network analyzers). Modern vector network analyzers measure amplitude and phase of voltage traveling wave phasors using essentially the same circuit as that used for the demodulation of digitally modulated wireless signals.\n\nMany electrical properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as gain, return loss, voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), reflection coefficient and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to optical engineering than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers to the way in which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's characteristic impedance.\n\nAlthough applicable at any frequency, S-parameters are mostly used for networks operating at radio frequency (RF) and microwave frequencies where signal power and energy considerations are more easily quantified than currents and voltages. S-parameters change with the measurement frequency, so frequency must be specified for any S-parameter measurements stated, in addition to the characteristic impedance or system impedance.\n\nS-parameters are readily represented in matrix form and obey the rules of matrix algebra.\n\nThe first published description of S-parameters was in the thesis of Vitold Belevitch in 1945. The name used by Belevitch was \"repartition matrix\" and limited consideration to lumped-element networks. The term \"scattering matrix\" was used by physicist and engineer Robert Henry Dicke in 1947 who independently developed the idea during wartime work on radar. In these S-parameters and scattering matrices, the scattered waves are the so-called traveling waves. A different kind of S-parameters was introduced in the 1960s. The latter was popularized by Kaneyuki Kurokawa, who referred to the new scattered waves as 'power waves.' The two types of S-parameters have very different properties and must not be mixed up. In his seminal paper, Kurokawa clearly distinguishes the power-wave S-parameters and the conventional, traveling-wave S-parameters. A variant of the latter is the pseudo-traveling-wave S-parameters.\nIn the S-parameter approach, an electrical network is regarded as a 'black box' containing various interconnected basic electrical circuit components or lumped elements such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transistors, which interacts with other circuits through \"ports\". The network is characterized by a square matrix of complex numbers called its S-parameter matrix, which can be used to calculate its response to signals applied to the ports.\n\nFor the S-parameter definition, it is understood that a network may contain any components provided that the entire network behaves linearly with incident small signals. It may also include many typical communication system components or 'blocks' such as amplifiers, attenuators, filters, couplers and equalizers provided they are also operating under linear and defined conditions.\n\nAn electrical network to be described by S-parameters may have any number of ports. Ports are the points at which electrical signals either enter or exit the network. Ports are usually pairs of terminals with the requirement that the current into one terminal is equal to the current leaving the other. S-parameters are used at frequencies where the ports are often coaxial or waveguide connections.\n\nThe S-parameter matrix describing an \"N\"-port network will be square of dimension \"N\" and will therefore contain formula_1 elements. At the test frequency each element or S-parameter is represented by a unitless complex number that represents magnitude and angle, i.e. amplitude and phase. The complex number may either be expressed in rectangular form or, more commonly, in polar form. The S-parameter magnitude may be expressed in linear form or logarithmic form. When expressed in logarithmic form, magnitude has the \"dimensionless unit\" of decibels. The S-parameter angle is most frequently expressed in degrees but occasionally in radians. Any S-parameter may be displayed graphically on a polar diagram by a dot for one frequency or a locus for a range of frequencies. If it applies to one port only (being of the form formula_2), it may be displayed on an impedance or admittance Smith Chart normalised to the system impedance. The Smith Chart allows simple conversion between the formula_2 parameter, equivalent to the voltage reflection coefficient and the associated (normalised) impedance (or admittance) 'seen' at that port.\n\nThe following information must be defined when specifying a set of S-parameters:\n\nFor a generic multi-port network, the ports are numbered from 1 to \"N\", where \"N\" is the total number of ports. For port \"i\", the associated S-parameter definition is in terms of incident and reflected 'power waves', formula_4 and formula_5 respectively.\n\nKurokawa defines the incident power wave for each port as\n\nand the reflected wave for each port is defined as\n\nwhere formula_8 is the impedance for port \"i\", formula_9 is the complex conjugate of formula_8, formula_11 and formula_12 are respectively the complex amplitudes of the voltage and current at port \"i\", and\n\nSometimes it is useful to assume that the reference impedance is the same for all ports in which case the definitions of the incident and reflected waves may be simplified to\n\nand\n\nNote that as was pointed out by Kurokawa himself, the above definitions of formula_16 and formula_17 are not unique. The relation between the vectors a and b, whose \"i\"-th components are the power waves formula_16 and formula_17 respectively, can be expressed using the S-parameter matrix S:\n\nOr using explicit components:\n\nA network will be reciprocal if it is passive and it contains only reciprocal materials that influence the transmitted signal. For example, attenuators, cables, splitters and combiners are all reciprocal networks and formula_22 in each case, or the S-parameter matrix will be equal to its transpose. Networks which include non-reciprocal materials in the transmission medium such as those containing magnetically biased ferrite components will be non-reciprocal. An amplifier is another example of a non-reciprocal network.\n\nA property of 3-port networks, however, is that they cannot be simultaneously reciprocal, loss-free, and perfectly matched. \n\nA lossless network is one which does not dissipate any power, or: formula_23. The sum of the incident powers at all ports is equal to the sum of the reflected powers at all ports. This implies that the S-parameter matrix is unitary, that is formula_24, where formula_25 is the conjugate transpose of formula_26 and formula_27 is the identity matrix.\n\nA lossy passive network is one in which the sum of the incident powers at all ports is greater than the sum of the reflected powers at all ports. It therefore dissipates power: formula_28. Thus formula_29, and formula_30 is positive definite.\n\nThe S-parameter matrix for the 2-port network is probably the most commonly used and serves as the basic building block for generating the higher order matrices for larger networks. In this case the relationship between the reflected, incident power waves and the S-parameter matrix is given by:\n\nExpanding the matrices into equations gives:\n\nand\n\nEach equation gives the relationship between the reflected and incident power waves at each of the network ports, 1 and 2, in terms of the network's individual S-parameters, formula_34, formula_35, formula_36 and formula_37. If one considers an incident power wave at port 1 (formula_38) there may result from it waves exiting from either port 1 itself (formula_39) or port 2 (formula_40). However, if, according to the definition of S-parameters, port 2 is terminated in a load identical to the system impedance (formula_41) then, by the maximum power transfer theorem, formula_40 will be totally absorbed making formula_43 equal to zero. Therefore, defining the incident voltage waves as formula_44 and formula_45 with the reflected waves being formula_46 and formula_47,\n\nSimilarly, if port 1 is terminated in the system impedance then formula_38 becomes zero, giving\n\nThe 2-port S-parameters have the following generic descriptions:\n\nIf, instead of defining the voltage wave direction relative to each port, they are defined by their absolute direction as forward formula_57 and reverse formula_58 waves then formula_59 and formula_44. The S-parameters then take on a more intuitive meaning such as the forward voltage gain being defined by the ratio of the forward voltages formula_61.\n\nUsing this, the above matrix may be expanded in a more practical way\n\nAn amplifier operating under linear (small signal) conditions is a good example of a non-reciprocal network and a matched attenuator is an example of a reciprocal network. In the following cases we will assume that the input and output connections are to ports 1 and 2 respectively which is the most common convention. The nominal system impedance, frequency and any other factors which may influence the device, such as temperature, must also be specified.\n\nThe complex linear gain G is given by\n\nThat is the linear ratio of the output reflected power wave divided by the input incident power wave, all values expressed as complex quantities. For lossy networks it is sub-unitary, for active networks formula_65 . \nIt will be equal with the voltage gain only when the device has equal input and output impedances.\n\nThe scalar linear gain (or linear gain magnitude) is given by\n\nThis represents the gain magnitude (absolute value), the ratio of the output power-wave to the input power-wave, and it equals the square-root of the power gain.\nThis is a real-value (or scalar) quantity, the phase information being dropped.\n\nThe scalar logarithmic (decibel or dB) expression for gain (g) is:\n\nThis is more commonly used than scalar linear gain and a positive quantity is normally understood as simply a \"gain\", while a negative quantity is a \"negative gain\" (a \"loss\"), equivalent to its magnitude in dB. For example, at 100 MHz, a 10 m length of cable may have a gain of −1 dB, equal to a loss of 1 dB.\n\nIn case the two measurement ports use the same reference impedance, the insertion loss () is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the transmission coefficient expressed in decibels. It is thus given by:\n\nformula_68 dB.\n\nIt is the extra loss produced by the introduction of the device under test (DUT) between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. The extra loss may be due to intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive. The negative of insertion loss expressed in decibels is defined as insertion gain and is equal to the scalar logarithmic gain (see: definition above).\n\nInput return loss () can be thought of as a measure of how close the actual input impedance of the network is to the nominal system impedance value. Input return loss expressed in decibels is given by\n\nNote that for passive two-port networks in which , it follows that return loss is a non-negative quantity: . Also note that somewhat confusingly, return loss is sometimes used as the negative of the quantity defined above, but this usage is, strictly speaking, incorrect based on the definition of loss.\n\nThe output return loss () has a similar definition to the input return loss but applies to the output port (port 2) instead of the input port. It is given by\n\nThe scalar logarithmic (decibel or dB) expression for reverse gain (formula_71) is:\n\nOften this will be expressed as reverse isolation (formula_73) in which case it becomes a positive quantity equal to the magnitude of formula_71 and the expression becomes:\n\nThe reflection coefficient at the input port (formula_76) or at the output port (formula_77) are equivalent to formula_34 and formula_37 respectively, so\n\nAs formula_34 and formula_37 are complex quantities, so are formula_76 and formula_77.\n\nThe reflection coefficients are complex quantities and may be graphically represented on polar diagrams or Smith Charts\n\nSee also the Reflection Coefficient article.\n\nThe voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) at a port, represented by the lower case 's', is a similar measure of port match to return loss but is a scalar linear quantity, the ratio of the standing wave maximum voltage to the standing wave minimum voltage. It therefore relates to the magnitude of the voltage reflection coefficient and hence to the magnitude of either formula_34 for the input port or formula_37 for the output port.\n\nAt the input port, the VSWR (formula_88) is given by\n\nAt the output port, the VSWR (formula_90) is given by\n\nThis is correct for reflection coefficients with a magnitude no greater than unity, which is usually the case. A reflection coefficient with a magnitude greater than unity, such as in a tunnel diode amplifier, will result in a negative value for this expression. VSWR, however, from its definition, is always positive. A more correct expression for port \"k\" of a multiport is;\n\n4 Port S Parameters are used to characterize 4 port networks. They include information regarding the reflected and incident power waves between the 4 ports of the network.\n\nThey are commonly used to analyze a pair of coupled transmission lines to determine the amount of cross-talk between them, if they are driven by two separate single ended signals, or the reflected and incident power of a differential signal driven across them. Many specifications of high speed differential signals define a communication channel in terms of the 4-Port S-Parameters, for example the 10-Gigabit Attachment Unit Interface (XAUI), SATA, PCI-X, and InfiniBand systems.\n\n4-Port mixed-Mode S-Parameters characterize a 4 port network in terms of the response of the network to common mode and differential stimulus signals. The following table displays the 4-Port Mixed-Mode S-Parameters.\n\nNote the format of the parameter notation SXYab, where \"S\" stands for scattering parameter or S-parameter, \"X\" is the response mode (differential or common), \"Y\" is the stimulus mode (differential or common), \"a\" is the response (output) port and b is the stimulus (input) port. This is the typical nomenclature for scattering parameters.\n\nThe first quadrant is defined as the upper left 4 parameters describing the differential stimulus and differential response characteristics of the device under test. This is the actual mode of operation for most high-speed differential interconnects and is the quadrant that receives the most attention. It includes input differential return loss (SDD11), input differential insertion loss (SDD21), output differential return loss (SDD22) and output differential insertion loss (SDD12). Some benefits of differential signal processing are;\n\nThe second and third quadrants are the upper right and lower left 4 parameters, respectively. These are also referred to as the cross-mode quadrants. This is because they fully characterize any mode conversion occurring in the device under test, whether it is common-to-differential SDCab conversion (EMI susceptibility for an intended differential signal SDD transmission application) or differential-to-common SCDab conversion (EMI radiation for a differential application). Understanding mode conversion is very helpful when trying to optimize the design of interconnects for gigabit data throughput.\n\nThe fourth quadrant is the lower right 4 parameters and describes the performance characteristics of the common-mode signal SCCab propagating through the device under test. For a properly designed SDDab differential device there should be minimal common-mode output SCCab. However, the fourth quadrant common-mode response data is a measure of common-mode transmission response and used in a ratio with the differential transmission response to determine the network common-mode rejection. This common mode rejection is an important benefit of differential signal processing and can be reduced to one in some differential circuit implementations.\n\nThe reverse isolation parameter formula_35 determines the level of feedback from the output of an amplifier to the input and therefore influences its stability (its tendency to refrain from oscillation) together with the forward gain formula_36. An amplifier with input and output ports perfectly isolated from each other would have infinite scalar log magnitude isolation or the linear magnitude of formula_35 would be zero. Such an amplifier is said to be unilateral. Most practical amplifiers though will have some finite isolation allowing the reflection coefficient 'seen' at the input to be influenced to some extent by the load connected on the output. An amplifier which is deliberately designed to have the smallest possible value of formula_97 is often called a buffer amplifier.\n\nSuppose the output port of a real (non-unilateral or bilateral) amplifier is connected to an arbitrary load with a reflection coefficient of formula_98. The actual reflection coefficient 'seen' at the input port formula_99 will be given by\n\nIf the amplifier is unilateral then formula_101 and formula_102 or, to put it another way, the output loading has no effect on the input.\n\nA similar property exists in the opposite direction, in this case if formula_103 is the reflection coefficient seen at the output port and formula_104 is the reflection coefficient of the source connected to the input port.\n\nAn amplifier is unconditionally stable if a load or source of \"any\" reflection coefficient can be connected without causing instability. This condition occurs if the magnitudes of the reflection coefficients at the source, load and the amplifier's input and output ports are simultaneously less than unity. An important requirement that is often overlooked is that the amplifier be a linear network with no poles in the right half plane. Instability can cause severe distortion of the amplifier's gain frequency response or, in the extreme, oscillation. To be unconditionally stable at the frequency of interest, an amplifier must satisfy the following 4 equations simultaneously:\n\nThe boundary condition for when each of these values is equal to unity may be represented by a circle drawn on the polar diagram representing the (complex) reflection coefficient, one for the input port and the other for the output port. Often these will be scaled as Smith Charts. In each case coordinates of the circle centre and the associated radius are given by the following equations:\n\nRadius formula_112\n\nCenter formula_113\n\nRadius formula_116\n\nCenter formula_117\n\nwhere, in both cases\n\nand the superscript star (*) indicates a complex conjugate.\n\nThe circles are in complex units of reflection coefficient so may be drawn on impedance or admittance based Smith Charts normalised to the system impedance. This serves to readily show the regions of normalised impedance (or admittance) for predicted unconditional stability. Another way of demonstrating unconditional stability is by means of the Rollett stability factor (formula_119), defined as\n\nThe condition of unconditional stability is achieved when formula_121 and formula_122\n\nThe Scattering transfer parameters or T-parameters of a 2-port network are expressed by the T-parameter matrix and are closely related to the corresponding S-parameter matrix. However, unlike S parameters, there is no simple physical means to measure the T parameters in a system, sometimes referred to as Youla waves. The T-parameter matrix is related to the incident and reflected normalised waves at each of the ports as follows:\n\nHowever, they could be defined differently, as follows :\n\nThe RF Toolbox add-on to MATLAB and several books (for example \"Network scattering parameters\") use this last definition, so caution is necessary. The \"From S to T\" and \"From T to S\" paragraphs in this article are based on the first definition. Adaptation to the second definition is trivial (interchanging T for T, and T for T).\nThe advantage of T-parameters compared to S-parameters is that providing reference impedances are purely, real or complex conjugate, they may be used to readily determine the effect of cascading 2 or more 2-port networks by simply multiplying the associated individual T-parameter matrices. If the T-parameters of say three different 2-port networks 1, 2 and 3 are formula_125, formula_126 and formula_127 respectively then the T-parameter matrix for the cascade of all three networks (formula_128) in serial order is given by:\n\nNote that matrix multiplication is not commutative, so the order is important. As with S-parameters, T-parameters are complex values and there is a direct conversion between the two types. Although the cascaded T-parameters is a simple matrix multiplication of the individual T-parameters, the conversion for each network's S-parameters to the corresponding T-parameters and the conversion of the cascaded T-parameters back to the equivalent cascaded S-parameters, which are usually required, is not trivial. However once the operation is completed, the complex full wave interactions between all ports in both directions will be taken into account. The following equations will provide conversion between S and T parameters for 2-port networks.\n\nFrom S to T:\n\nWhere formula_134 indicates the determinant of the matrix formula_135,\n\nFrom T to S\n\nWhere formula_141 indicates the determinant of the matrix formula_142.\n\nThe S-parameter for a 1-port network is given by a simple 1 × 1 matrix of the form formula_144 where n is the allocated port number. To comply with the S-parameter definition of linearity, this would normally be a passive load of some type. An antenna is a common one-port network for which small values of formula_145 indicate that the antenna will either radiate or dissipate/store power.\n\nHigher order S-parameters for pairs of dissimilar ports (formula_146), where formula_147 may be deduced similarly to those for 2-port networks by considering pairs of ports in turn, in each case ensuring that all of the remaining (unused) ports are loaded with an impedance identical to the system impedance. In this way the incident power wave for each of the unused ports becomes zero yielding similar expressions to those obtained for the 2-port case. S-parameters relating to single ports only (formula_148) require all of the remaining ports to be loaded with an impedance identical to the system impedance therefore making all of the incident power waves zero except that for the port under consideration. In general therefore we have:\n\nand\n\nFor example, a 3-port network such as a 2-way splitter would have the following S-parameter definitions\n\nS-parameters are most commonly measured with a vector network analyzer (VNA).\n\nThe S-parameter test data may be provided in many alternative formats, for example: list, graphical (Smith chart or polar diagram).\n\nIn list format the measured and corrected S-parameters are tabulated against frequency. The most common list format is known as Touchstone or SNP, where N is the number of ports. Commonly text files containing this information would have the filename extension '.s2p'. An example of a Touchstone file listing for the full 2-port S-parameter data obtained for a device is shown below:\n\nRows beginning with an exclamation mark contains only comments. The row beginning with the hash symbol indicates that in this case frequencies are in megahertz (MHZ), S-parameters are listed (S), magnitudes are in dB log magnitude (DB) and the system impedance is 50 Ohm (R 50). There are 9 columns of data. Column 1 is the test frequency in megahertz in this case. Columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the magnitudes of formula_34, formula_36, formula_35 and formula_37 respectively in dB. Columns 3, 5, 7 and 9 are the angles of formula_34, formula_36, formula_35 and formula_37 respectively in degrees.\n\nAny 2-port S-parameter may be displayed on a Smith chart using polar co-ordinates, but the most meaningful would be formula_34 and formula_37 since either of these may be converted directly into an equivalent normalized impedance (or admittance) using the characteristic Smith Chart impedance (or admittance) scaling appropriate to the system impedance.\n\nAny 2-port S-parameter may be displayed on a polar diagram using polar co-ordinates.\n\nIn either graphical format each S-parameter at a particular test frequency is displayed as a dot. If the measurement is a sweep across several frequencies a dot will appear for each.\n\nThe S-parameter matrix for a network with just one port will have just one element represented in the form formula_2, where n is the number allocated to the port. Most VNAs provide a simple one-port calibration capability for one port measurement to save time if that is all that is required.\n\nVNAs designed for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk of this approach is that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be as close as possible to a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.\n\nAssuming that the extra loads are specified adequately, if necessary, two or more of the S-parameter subscripts are modified from those relating to the VNA (1 and 2 in the case considered above) to those relating to the network under test (1 to N, if N is the total number of DUT ports). For example, if the DUT has 5 ports and a two port VNA is connected with VNA port 1 to DUT port 3 and VNA port 2 to DUT port 5, the measured VNA results (formula_34, formula_35, formula_36 and formula_37) would be equivalent to formula_170, formula_171, formula_172 and formula_173 respectively, assuming that DUT ports 1, 2 and 4 were terminated in adequate 50 Ohm loads . This would provide 4 of the necessary 25 S-parameters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972343", "title": "The Runelords", "text": "The Runelords\n\nThe Runelords is a series of fantasy novels by American author David Farland of which the first part was published in 1998. In the universe of The Runelords, there exists a unique magical system which relies on the existence of distinct bodily attributes, such as brawn, grace, and wit. These attributes can be transferred from one individual (or animal) to another in a process known as \"giving an endowment\". Lords who have taken many endowments become extremely powerful, almost superhuman, and are known as Runelords.\n\nSeeking the hand of the Princess Iome Sylvarresta, Prince Gaborn Val Orden is sidetracked when the Wolf Lord Raj Ahten invades the Kingdom of Heredon, seeking to rule all of Rofehavan.\n\nRaj Ahten and the forces of Rofehavan strike an uneasy alliance as they join forces to battle a Reaver invasion at the walled city of Carris.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Carris, Gaborn leads the troops of Rofehavan against the fleeing Reaver horde, while Raj Ahten returns to Indhopal to protect his own kingdom from a separate Reaver invasion.\n\nGaborn Val Orden leads an expedition into the heart of the underworld to confront the One True Master of the Reavers, to decide in battle the fate of mankind and of the Earth itself.\n\nNine years after the events of \"The Lair of Bones\", Gaborn the Earth King finally succumbs to old age and passes on. In his wake, enemies of the Earth try to take control of the land, and Gaborn's eldest son Fallion, still only a child, must fight to protect his kingdom and his family.\n\nThe sixth book of The Runelords was released in the US on 21 September 2007.\n\nFallion returns to Mystarria and is tricked into combining his world with another, when he tries to restore a sapling of the 'One True Tree' which has been cursed by Lady Despair. Areth Sul Urstone, the mirror world incarnation of Fallion's father, Gaborn val Orden, is being held captive in the wyrmling lair, with Lady Despair eventually taking human form by using Areth as her host.\n\nThe seventh book in the series was released 16 September 2008.\n\nLord/Lady Despair tortures Fallion through many dedicates with a rune of compassion. Both sides vie for possession of the mountains of blood metal available on the combined world. Despair begins to accumulate new and evil accomplices from other worlds. Rhianna saves Fallion and the 'rescue party' by bypassing Despair's new found \"Earth Sense\", by not harming any wyrmlings during the rescue. Despair has 'Chosen' Fallion, and knows his whereabouts at all times. Vulgnash the death lord is sent by Despair to retrieve Fallion, and is confronted by the Wizard Sisel, who makes Vulgnash mortal and human rather than killing him. Fallion returns with Vulgnash to Despair in the wyrmling lair.\n\nThe eighth book in the series was released 13 October 2009.\n\nBorenson & Myrrima arrive back from Landesfallen following the binding of the worlds, at Ox Port, where they are hunted by the wyrmlings, but surreptitiously helped and protected by the local wyrmling leader, Crull-maldor, who hopes to aid Borenson/Aaath Ulber in his prophesied destruction of the emperor Zul-Torac, clearing the way for Crull-maldor to replace him as Lord Despair's side. The wight exacts vengeance on Borenson/Aaath Ulber after his successful, endowment aided, destruction of the wyrmling forces and lair, by murdering Myrrima.\n\n\"A Tale of Tales\" has not been released. In 2018, Farland suggested readers buy his writing courses as support so he can finish the series.\n\nThe universe of The Runelords is well fleshed out, populated by diverse beings, with rich backstories that assist the understanding of the events as described in the books.\n\nThere is a legend about the \"Sum of All Men\", a man with so many endowments and so beloved by the people that he became immortal and retained all of his endowments even after the deaths of his Dedicates. The strengths of the people supposedly flowed to him unrestrained, somehow without draining the dedicates themselves of the attributes. The books refer to Daylan of the Black Hammer as the Sum of All Men, although in the sixth novel it is revealed that Daylan is in fact a Bright One from the Netherworld, rather than a mortal man with many endowments. It is also revealed that Daylan has a mere four endowments of Brawn, in stark contrast to the legends which claim he has a huge number. Daylan himself claims to have started these legends, though his purpose for doing so has not been revealed.\n\nLike the Sum of All Men, the Earth King is a legendary figure among all cultures. The first human Earth King, for there have been Earth Kings of many races, was a man named Erden Geboren, who united humanity using wizardly powers granted to him by the god-like force of Earth to protect his followers from the Toth and reavers. The Toth were eliminated, but the reavers survived. Geboren's nation was eventually split up after his death, and the royal families of most human nations are directly descended from his most trusted lieutenants and related to Geboren through intermarriage. It has become common for small, homemade dolls and icons of the Earth King to be placed at doorways during Hostenfest, an annual harvest festival, to invite the power and blessings of the Earth King into one's home.\n\nThe Earth King is commonly given immense power in magics wielded by the Earth Wardens, the common wizards of the Earth. He can sleep buried under soil and commune with the Earth in his dreams or may be granted the knowledge of previously unknown runes and spells. Earth Kings are also known to have the magical \"Earth Sight,\" a gift which they can use to see across long distances or into the minds and souls of other people. Using this Earth Sight, they can judge who is worthy to save, and can Choose people. The Earth Kings sense danger approaching their Chosen, though do not know specifics, and can send telepathic warnings or other messages to their Chosen. The death of a Chosen is very painful to an Earth King. Legends say that Erden Geboren died without a single wound upon his body but with a heart broken from the swift deaths of many of his Chosen.\n\nThe Runelords universe has a number of races and groups:\n\nVery little is revealed about the Duskin in the course of the series, though it is known they were great Earth-wizards and craftsmen. The Duskin were smaller than humans but bore a general resemblance to human shape, having the same number of limbs and being bipeds. Duskin dwelt beneath the surface of the earth, but in caverns much closer to the surface then their ancient rivals, the Reavers.\n\nHumans are the dominant species of the surface world. They are identical to real humans, except they are not the first or only intelligent race to arise in the world. Humanity's survival has been placed at risk many times, just as other dominant species have been eliminated in the past.\n\nHumans reside mainly upon one continent, though more exist throughout the world. They are divided principally into the Rofehavanish, the Indhopalese, and the Inkarrans. They have produced wizards of all kinds, while many other species only have one or two different kinds of wizards. Individually, a single human might have slim to no chance of standing against the monstrous might of creatures such as the Reavers. However, in numbers and through the magical granting of endowments, humans have learned to consolidate their strength and stand against other species that could otherwise destroy them. They are also the most technologically advanced of the extant species.\n\nReavers are a massive species of subterranean creatures which bear no resemblance to any surface dwelling creature. Reavers are somewhat like insects, communicating through scents and having various \"castes\" which perform different functions within their \"hives\", though they do not have a collective intelligence. They are unchallenged masters of the Underworld.\n\nReavers are incredibly hard to kill due to their vast size, armor-like skin and crystalline bones. The best way to slay a Reaver is to attack its brain through the mouth or the \"sweet triangle\", an area on the back of the Reaver's head where its bone-plates do not quite meet.\n\nThe Toth are an extinct race of sorcerers that were thought to be in some way related to the Reavers, though they were more vaguely humanoid and significantly smaller. The Toth were an expansionistic race and were slain by King Fallion of Mystarria when he led the massed armies of humanity across the Caroll Sea to the Toth homeland. The only surviving Toth take the form of wights, deadly ghost-like spirits which dwell in dangerous, wild places and bring icy death with their touch. Generally only Toth sorcerers remain as wights, their spirits presumably having been stronger than their non-magical fellows.\n\nNomen are black-coated shaggy creatures that lumber on all fours in preference to an upright gait. They are crafty nocturnal hunters who prefer small packs to seeking prey alone. Their hands are clawed, and their eyes are red and seemingly glow in the dark. Nomen will drop on unwary travelers from a forest canopy rather than attempt a direct confrontation. They use basic weapons, favoring the spear most of all. Nomen can be found in the Dunwood and are said to inhabit the Hest Mountains beyond Inkarra in great numbers. In the distant past, they came north and invaded, but were slaughtered and their numbers greatly reduced.\n\nFrowth giants are extremely large, standing roughly twenty feet tall and eight feet wide at the shoulders. They are covered in a matted yellow fur, and their faces are dominated by a long snout. Their huge size and strength makes them useful in labor and in combat. Frowth giants sometimes wear armor, and they carry huge iron-bound staves as weapons. With sharp teeth, they will kill or eat carrion if it is available. They have a limited ability for speech.\n\nFerrin are small, ratlike humanoids who live across the temperate world. Some live out in the wild, foraging for food and protecting their warrens, while many others live in human cities. Those who live in human cities often filch food and hunt rats. Most consider them a minor nuisance at best and vermin to be exterminated at worst. They are somewhat intelligent, though not as intelligent as humans. They have a very basic language and understand clothing and tools, including simple weapons.\n\nThe Days are an ancient order of historians whose goal is to follow and observe Kings and Runelords in order to record their actions for future generations. Each Days records the events of their charge via a mind link with another of their order, created by exchanging an endowment of Wit with another Days. The Days serve beings known simply as the Time Lords, although little has been discovered about these Time Lords as of yet. \n\nWhile one Days follows their Lord, their counterpart lives in a monastery-type environment in the far north of Orwynne, kept away from anything other than their principal purpose, to compile the life journal of their chosen Runelord. The power of the Days order comes from knowing that at any given time they can find out what is happening to any particular noble at any place in the world. Therefore, should they wish to, the Days could influence events on a kingdom-wide scale. However, their service is completely focused upon observation, with a strict policy of noninterference – even in the face of cataclysmic war they would not act to save millions, nor would a Days stop to save a single drowning person. Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord. They also seem to use their knowledge to tear down lords who attempt to drive them away, sharing the lord's plans and secrets with his enemies.\n\nThe Days are easily identifiable by their simple brown robes.\n\nThe Knights Equitable are an order of knights and force soldiers who have forsworn their loyalties to their kings and lords. Instead, they organize in a loose brotherhood under a High Marshal, and hold themselves to a general devotion to eliminate Wolf Lords and evil from the world. No man in the Knights Equitable is a \"lord\" to another in the order, though they do have ranks, which anyone may advance through by merit, not birth. Skalbairn was the High Marshal of the Knights Equitable through the Earth King series, and as their leader holds as much military power as some kings. They are also known as the Righteous Horde.\n\nWights are the spirits of the dead, often human, Duskin, or Toth. Many hide in wild, out-of-the-way places away from the sight of humans. Some, such as the Duskin and human wights of the Dunnwood, are largely harmless. Others, like the Toth wights in the bogs in the south of Mystarria, loathe humans and do not hesitate to attack them. The chill touch of a wight is a slow and painful death.\n\nExistence as a wight provides something of a \"living\" afterlife upon the world. Many people of Rofehavan, as long as they love the land, may become one of the wights of the Dunnwood upon their death, reunited with lost loved ones.\n\nSeveral important creatures come from the Netherworld. They are intensely magical beings, of great power far surpassing anything in the normal world. Bright Ones are inhabitants of the Netherworld and are much mightier and wiser than mortal men. Glories are angelic beings of light, air, and fire that occasionally fight alongside humans, whereas Darkling Glories are Glories that serve destruction and evil. Loci are malevolent spirits which can possess the bodies of other beings.\n\nThe human world of the Runelords is divided up into the three realms of Rofehavan, Inkarra, and Indhopal. Rofehavan, which dominates the northern half of the continent, is most like medieval Europe in culture. Indhopal, which takes up most of the southern half of the continent, is much like the historical Middle East, though with a wide variety of societies in the region. Readers see the least of Inkarra, a land hidden behind the Alcair Mountains to the east of Indhopal and south of Rofehavan. Inkarra is most similar to the Congo region of Africa, with jungles, exotic creatures, and humans that are seen as separate from the others (just as Africans were viewed as separate by both Middle Easterns and Europeans)\n\nThe nations of Rofehavan are as follows:\n\nIndhopal dominates the southwest third of the continent, and much of it is known for its arid deserts. Other parts of Indhopal are rich and lush, covered in tropical rainforests. Raj Ahten has conquered all of Indhopal by the time the Runelords begins. The nations of Indhopal are as follows:\n\nOn maps a united realm, Inkarra is rife with kings great and small who constantly scheme for power and place. The greatest is the Storm King Zandaros, both the High King of Inkarra and perhaps the mightiest human Air Wizard. As High King, all other kings of Inkarra must pay tribute to Zandaros. The Inkarrans despise the Rofehavanish, who they call the Dayborn, considering them to be utter barbarians.\n\nThe border between Mystarria and Inkarra is a closed one, as some sixty years before, criminals and assassins crept across the border. Three such assassins were captured and executed outright, their bodies sent home as warning. Zandaros protested the executions and insulted the Mystarrians, and so a response was sent by skyrider that if the Inkarrans would not patrol the border and catch their own criminals, Mystarria could not be blamed for doing so themselves. Zandaros's own response to this message was to send the child skyrider's head back in a sack. Ever since, Rofehavanish from Mystarria have been forbidden to enter Inkarra on penalty of death, and Mystarria has forbidden any Inkarrans from ever entering the nation. Most other nations of Rofehavan tolerate Inkarran traders and traveling performers.\n\nThe Inkarrans call themselves the \"Night Children\" in their own language. They are a closely related offshoot of humanity, one that has become nocturnal. Skin and hair is often solid white, as are their \"ice white\" eyes, which can see perfectly in near total darkness. There are more than a few halfbreeds amongst the Inkarrans, called kutasarri in their language, who are often shunned because of their \"Dayborn\" appearance and night-blind eyes.\n\n\n\n\nThe world of the Runelords has two major forms of magic, both based upon runes of power: elemental magic, and endowments. Wizards wield the elemental magics (air, earth, fire, and water), while anyone who knows the proper chants and songs (along with a forcible of blood metal) can use the magic required to grant endowments.\n\nMost works of magic require the use of runes. These symbols each carry power, some greater than others. Common people can use some of them to minor effect, though they are most powerful when created by wizards. Anyone may draw runes of strength to make a stone keep durable, but those same runes drawn by a wizard will protect a fortress's walls for centuries.\n\nThe main magical system of the series relies on a system of attributes which are inherent to every living creature. These attributes are transferable to and from both man and animal, so brawn from a dog can be transferred to a man. Once an individual gives an attribute to another, the giver loses that particular attribute until the death of the recipient. Each person can only give one endowment in their lifetime. Endowments include brawn (physical strength), grace (physical dexterity), wit (memory and clearness of thought), metabolism (speed at which the body's processes operate), glamor, voice, stamina, sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, talent, will, bloodlust, and pain. Talent and will are more difficult to create and are only known by the Inkarrans. Bloodlust and pain are perverse in nature and were devised by the one true master of evil to strengthen her troops and torture the humans, specifically Fallion.\n\nEndowments are transferred with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast of a rare material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small branding iron. The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, is part of the duties of a special class of magician called a facilitator. When the forcible is ready, the facilitator invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. The facilitator touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert facilitator can tell whether the endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute. The forcible is expended by this process and may not be reused.\n\nA dedicate must give up his attribute willingly; the simple act of touching him with a forcible is not enough. However, unscrupulous Runelords can threaten a potential dedicate's friends and family to force cooperation. Dedicates are normally selected from individuals whose attributes are strong; one selects a strong man to dedicate his brawn, a person with excellent vision to dedicate sight, and so forth.\n\n\nA dedicate can vector endowments. That is, he can receive endowments of one particular variety from several dedicates, becoming extremely well endowed. Then he can himself dedicate that same endowment to another, who benefits from the endowment supplied by his dedicate and those supplied by all of that individual's dedicates. Each endowment requires space on the skin for the rune inscribed by the forcible; Runelords who intend to acquire hundreds of endowments (such as Raj Ahten) must vector them because there isn't sufficient room on their bodies otherwise.\n\n"}

He was a grandson of George Mason and represented the Confederate States of America as appointed commissioner of the Confederacy to the United Kingdom and France between 1861 and 1865, during the American Civil War.\n\nIn November 1861, Mason was among those captured by Federal troops during the Trent Affair while he was on a mission to England.\n\nHe was born on Analostan Island, now Theodore Roosevelt Island, in the District of Columbia. He was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (1818) and received a law degree from the College of William and Mary (1820).\n\nHe practiced law in Virginia and was a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 and a member of the House of Delegates. He was elected to the Twenty-fifth United States Congress in 1836 as a Jackson Democrat.\n\nIn 1847, he was elected to the Senate after the death of Isaac S. Pennybacker, and he was re-elected in 1850 and 1856. Mason famously read aloud the dying Senator John C. Calhoun's final speech to the Senate, on March 4, 1850, which warned of disunion and dire consequences if the North did not permanently guarantee the South equal representation in Congress. He also complained of personal liberty laws: \"Although the loss of property is felt, the loss of honor is felt still more.\"\n\nMason also drafted the (second) Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, enacted on September 18, 1850 as a part of the Compromise Measures of that year. Mason represented the majority view in leading the Senate committee that investigated the John Brown raid on Harper's Ferry in October 1859. (The document was published as the \"U.S. Congress, Senate Select Commission on the Harper's Ferry Invasion\" (June 15, 1860) but is often referred to as the Mason Report.)\n\nMason was President pro tempore of the Senate during the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth Congresses but was expelled from the Senate in 1861 for support of the Confederate States.\n\nWhile he was traveling to his post as Confederate envoy to Britain and France on the British mail steamer RMS \"Trent\", the ship was stopped by USS \"San Jacinto\" on November 8, 1861. Mason and John Slidell were confined in Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, precipitating the \"Trent\" Affair, which threatened to bring Britain into open war with the United States.\nThe US public erupted with a huge display of triumphalism at this dramatic capture. Even the cool-headed Lincoln was swept along in the celebratory spirit, but when he and his cabinet studied the likely consequences of a war with Britain, their enthusiasm waned. After some careful diplomatic exchanges, they admitted that the capture had been conducted contrary to maritime law and that private citizens could not be classified as \"enemy despatches.\" Slidell and Mason were released, and war was averted. The two diplomats set sail for England again on January 1, 1862. Mason represented the Confederacy there until April 1865. One of his first acts in London was to raise the issue of Union blockades.\n\nUntil 1868, he lived in Canada, and he then returned to the Clarens Estate near Alexandria, Virginia. He died at Clarens in 1871. He was interred in the churchyard of Christ Church, Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nMason married Eliza Margaretta Chew (1798–1874) on 25 July 1822 at Cliveden in Germantown, Pennsylvania. The couple had eight children:\n\n\nHe was a grandson of George Mason (1725–1792); nephew of George Mason V (1753–1796); grandnephew of Thomson Mason (1733–1785); first cousin once removed of Stevens Thomson Mason (1760–1803) and John Thomson Mason (1765–1824); son of John Mason (1766–1849) and Anna Maria Murray Mason (1776–1857); first cousin of Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), George Mason VI (1786–1834), and Richard Barnes Mason (1797–1850); second cousin of Armistead Thomson Mason (1787–1819), John Thomson Mason (1787–1850), and John Thomson Mason, Jr. (1815–1873); second cousin once removed of Stevens Thomson Mason (1811–1843); and first cousin thrice removed of Charles O'Conor Goolrick.

{"id": "1972352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972352", "title": "Richard Graves MacDonnell", "text": "Richard Graves MacDonnell\n\nSir Richard Graves MacDonnell (name in ) (3 September 1814 – 5 February 1881) was an Anglo-Irish lawyer, judge and colonial governor. His posts as governor included Governor of the British Settlements in West Africa, Governor of Saint Vincent, Governor of South Australia, Governor of Nova Scotia and Governor of Hong Kong. Several places around the world are named for him including MacDonnell Road in Hong Kong; and, the MacDonnell Ranges and Sir Richard Peninsula in Australia.\n\nRichard Graves MacDonnell was born in Dublin, 8 September 1814, the second son of Richard MacDonnell, the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and Jane Graves (1793–1882), second daughter of Richard Graves, Dean of Ardagh. He was a nephew of Robert James Graves and the brother of Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell. His first cousins included Lady Valentine Blake of Menlough, Sir William Collis Meredith, Edmund Allen Meredith, John Dawson Mayne and Francis Brinkley. MacDonnell entered Trinity College Dublin in 1830, was elected a scholar in 1833, and graduated B.A. (1835), M.A., (1836), LL.B., (1845), and LL.D.., (1862)\n\nMacDonnell was called to the Irish bar in 1838, and to the English bar, at Lincoln’s Inn, 25 January 1841. On 20 July 1843, he was appointed to the new post of Chief Justice of the Gambia. After four years there, amidst long breaks for his health travelling through the United States and Canada, he intended to hand in his resignation to Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey and resume practice at the English bar. But, on 1 October 1847, Grey persuaded him otherwise and appointed him Governor of the British settlements in Gambia, a post he held for a further four years.\n\nWhile in Gambia, MacDonnell (a cousin of the explorers Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton and Admiral Richard Charles Mayne) spent much of his time indulging his passion for exploration, and organising punitive campaigns against unruly native tribes. His expeditions opened up the interior of Africa from the Gambia River to the Senegal River. The military expeditions which he accompanied against native tribes who had long oppressed the traders of the river were a success and extended the limits of British commerce in the region. On one visit to a native king an ambush was laid for him, and he narrowly avoided being assassinated. In return, the British government sent four hundred men to inflict a summary chastisement, with MacDonnell acting as Captain of one of the volunteer companies.\n\nIn 1852, (when he was also gazetted Companion of the Order of the Bath) he was nominated as Lieutenant Governor of St. Lucia, but without taking up the post he was sent, 10 January 1853, to become administrator and Captain General of the island of St. Vincent. He was Lieutenant General of St Vincent from 1853 to 1854.\n\nDescribed as a 'dominant personality' and having gained a reputation for forthrightness and intolerance, MacDonnell was appointed the sixth Governor of South Australia, arriving 9 June 1855, and taking over from Boyle Travers Finniss who had been acting since the departure of Sir Henry Young. Shortly before leaving for Australia, in 1856 he was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George by Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Australia, MacDonnell was involved in heated debate over the composition of the legislature; MacDonnell favoured a single chamber while the majority of colonists preferred a two-house system, which brought him the support of the conservatives, but united the liberals and radicals against him. Eventually a two-house system prevailed, although the Upper House had a property franchise. Difficulties between MacDonnell and his officials led to several changes of government. He extended railway and telegraph communications within the colony and opened up valuable copper mines on the Yorke Peninsula, while increasing the progress in agricultural and pastoral pursuits.\n\nMacDonnell showed little concern for the Australian working class, claiming that charity fostered sloth and pauperism. He was particularly impressed with the settlers from Germany, and he predicted that the colony had a great future for producing wine. In his seven-year term the acreage under wheat doubled in South Australia and he argued that farmers with capital would succeed as long as their methods did not rob the soil.\n\nMacDonnell's passion for exploration greatly aided in opening up the interior of Australia, in particular the Murray River, and he developed many of the natural resources of the colony. He travelled widely in the colony and in 1859 led a small party to investigate country around the northern lakes and claypans, riding 1800 miles (2897 km) in three months. He maintained that Charles Sturt and Edward John Eyre were overrated as explorers as they seemed \"generally to have a knack of getting into the most dismal places and finding barrenness from Dan to Beersheba\". He instead urged the colonists to support the efforts of John McDouall Stuart to cross the continent.\n\nMacDonnell was regarded in Australia as both 'powerful and hospitable'. He was an enthusiastic member of local rifle and archery clubs and keenly interested in the volunteer defence movement. He also identified himself with most of the literary, artistic and philanthropic organizations. He saw himself as a leader and innovator, and though genial, at times his bustling energy dismayed Adelaide society. As a patron of South Australian culture he encouraged students who could not travel abroad to continue their post-primary schooling, and with his customary dash personally examined candidates and donated prizes, but his plan collapsed after he left the colony. He left South Australia, 4 March 1862, for a holiday in Ireland before taking up his next post.\n\nOn the recommendation of his predecessor, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby, MacDonnell was appointed Governor of Nova Scotia from 28 May 1864, until October 1865, taking up residence at Government House (Nova Scotia). His arrival coincided with the Confederation of Canada which he made no secret of being in opposition to, and he refused to become a tool of either the British Colonial Secretary or the Governor General of Canada, telling Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, \"You shall not make a mayor of \"me\", I can tell you!\" Confederation went ahead, making MacDonnell's tenure in Nova Scotia a short one. He was succeeded by one of Nova Scotia's most distinguished sons, General Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Kars.\n\nOn 19 October 1865, MacDonnell was appointed as the sixth Governor of Hong Kong, a position in which he served until 1872. During his tenure, MacDonnell developed Victoria Peak, which would eventually become the premier residential quarters in Hong Kong, accessible only to rich European merchants. MacDonnell also ordered the construction of a hospital which catered to the needs of the local Chinese population. In addition, he legalised gambling in Hong Kong which led to social problems and was later made illegal once again. In 1871 he was gazetted K.C.M.G.\n\nFinally, MacDonnell's administration was marred by a huge budget deficit, which resulted in the government asking the HSBC for a financial aid package. The administration was also damaged by the actions of the Canton Customs agency, who patrolled the waters off Hong Kong and boarded ships to search for smuggled goods. This was called by Hong Kong's British merchant community a blockade, and affected Hong Kong's economy for the next 20 years.\n\nIn 1847, MacDonnell married Blanche Ann, daughter of Francis Skurray of Beckington, Somerset, who lived at Stanhope Place, Hyde Park and Percy Cross Lodge, Fulham, before retiring to 5 Brunswick Square, Brighton. Sir Richard and Lady MacDonnell lived near Hyde Park in London and after his retirement in 1872 they spent much time in Italy and France, dying at Hyères, 5 February 1881.\n\nThey are buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, on the southern side. They died without children.\n\n\nNamed after Richard MacDonnell:\nMacDonnell Street in Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory\nNamed after Blanche MacDonnell:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972356", "title": "WYCC", "text": "WYCC\n\nWYCC, virtual channel 20 (UHF digital channel 25), is a First Nations Experience (FNX)-affiliated television station licensed to Chicago, Illinois, United States. Owned by not-for-profit broadcasting entity Window to the World Communications, Inc., it is a sister station to PBS member WTTW (channel 11) and commercial classical music radio station WFMT (98.7 FM). The three stations share studios in the Renée Crown Public Media Center, located at 5400 North Saint Louis Avenue (adjacent to the main campus of Northeastern Illinois University) in the city's North Park neighborhood; WYCC and WTTW share transmitter facilities atop the Willis Tower on South Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop. WYCC previously maintained studios at Kennedy–King College on South Union Avenue and Halsted Parkway in the Englewood neighborhood. There is no separate website for WYCC; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WTTW.\n\nOn October 25, 2017, WYCC, then owned by the City Colleges of Chicago, announced that it would terminate its affiliation with PBS, broadcasting MHz Worldview instead on subchannel 20.1 in the interim. The station ceased broadcast operations on November 27, 2017, but returned to the air on WTTW's spectrum on April 23, 2018. With MHz Worldview now transitioned to a streaming-only service, WYCC flipped to FNX on March 1, 2020.\n\nActing as the market's secondary outlet for the educational programming service, WYCC served as one of three PBS member stations serving the Chicago metropolitan area, alongside WTTW and Gary, Indiana-licensed WYIN (channel 56). Because the Chicago market is well-served by PBS' national programming from those two stations, WYCC's programming focused more on adult educational and other instructional programming, along with other programming obtained by producers outside of those associated with PBS, which account for only 13% of the programs provided as part of WYCC's weekly schedule.\n\nFunding for the station was provided by the usual mix of member donations, pledge drives and grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as funds allocated by the Illinois General Assembly and the city of Chicago through the City Colleges division. WYCC made the claim of being the largest public television station that is run by a minority operation, and reaches the 3.5 million households in the Chicago area, along with six million households across Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nOn the heels of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s recent lifting of its moratorium on new television station applications (the result of the agency's passage of the Sixth Report & Order of 1952) as well as the opening of additional channels on the UHF band, WIND Inc., a joint venture between the \"Chicago Daily News\" and the family of Ralph J. Atlass – one-time owners of radio stations WBBM (780 AM) and WIND (560 AM) petitioned the FCC for a construction permit to build a television station on UHF channel 20, which would be licensed to nearby Gary, Indiana. The group also applied for, and received the call letters WIND-TV for their new station, which was never signed on under their purview. On November 8, 1956, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation purchased the construction permit and WIND radio for $5.3 million.\n\nUHF stations struggled mightily during the 1950s, with many shutting down outright, due partly to the fact that manufacturers did not include UHF tuners in television sets (an issue that was remedied when the FCC made these tuners a requirement for sets made from 1964 onward through its passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act). By the end of the decade, Group W had soured on the idea of launching a station in the Chicago market; in late 1962, Group W offered the construction permit (allegedly sold for $1, although some reports list the selling price as $65,000) to Edward L. Ryerson, member of the board of the Chicago Educational Television Association (now Window to the World Communications and licensee of WTTW, channel 11).\n\nFirst conceived in 1953 and debuting in September 1955 as Chicago's first non-commercial educational television station, WTTW began to experience growing pains by the early 1960s. Gradually moving away from its original mission of providing classroom instructional courses as more and more of its broadcast day was filled first with programming from NET and later PBS and those distributed by other member stations, the idea of a second station seemed like the perfect answer to provide additional sources for the displaced educational programming.\n\nAccording to the quarterly \"WTTW Channel 11 News\" program guide from Winter 1963, hopes were high for the new station. Intending to devote its entire schedule to instructional programming (including the already established College of the Air telecourses), possibilities for the station—to be given the call letters WXXW—included special police training programs; police bulletins (including lineups); public health instruction in pre-natal and post-natal care; instructional programs for election judges; training for Army, Navy and Air Force reserve units; civil defense disaster training; programs for unskilled workers; professional information services for physicians and dentists; and seminar programs for various other professional groups.\n\nIn September 1965, the former construction permit for WIND-TV officially became Chicago's second UHF television station and second non-commercial outlet as WXXW on channel 20. However the station, known as \"the Classroom of the Air\", was essentially a failure. Plagued by a weak signal and a schedule filled with what former WTTW station manager Edward Morris called \"talking heads and a blackboard,\" WXXW limped along until it quietly went dark in 1974. Throughout its entire existence, WXXW was only able to transmit in black-and-white, making it and commercial independent station WCIU-TV (channel 26) the only television stations in the Chicago market that had not transitioned to color broadcasts in the early 1970s. The monochrome transmissions were just another nail in the station's coffin.\n\nIn 1977, a consortium known as the Chicago Metropolitan Educational Council acquired the long-dark WXXW license from WTTW general manager Bill McCarter (again, the license was allegedly purchased for $1, making it the cheapest television license ever in the Chicago area) and changed its call letters to WCME; however, the station never broadcast under the consortium's ownership. In 1982, Oscar Shabat, founding Chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago, asked the consortium to release the dormant license; on February 2, 1983, channel 20 was reborn as WYCC (standing for \"We are Your City Colleges\"). In its modern history, the station featured a variety of programming on three digital subchannels, including those provided by PBS, those produced locally, and international news and educational programs.\n\nOn October 25, 2017, a notice was posted on the station's website saying that subchannel 20.1 would broadcast MHz WorldView. The station is no longer affiliated with PBS. WTTW, the main PBS station in the Chicago area, began accepting WYCC members. \"The content on 20.2 and 20.3 will not change during this period.\" The period of time was not defined precisely.\n\nOn December 7, 2017, Window to the World Communications, owner of WTTW, announced that it was seeking to purchase WYCC from the City Colleges of Chicago, in a move that would put the two stations under the same corporate umbrella. However, the license assignment application was not submitted to the FCC until late January 2018, which disclosed that Window to the World Communications would acquire the WYCC license for $100,000. As part of the purchase, WYCC entered into a channel sharing agreement with WTTW. The sale was approved by the FCC on March 13, 2018, and was completed on April 20. As a part of MHz WorldView's closure on March 1, 2020, WTTW planned to move World programming to channel 20.1, while the original channel slot (11.3) would've broadcast Create. However, WTTW changed its plan to provide FNX programming instead.\n\nWYCC began carrying First Nations Experience, featuring programming focusing on Native American culture, on November 1, 2013 over digital subchannel 20.2.\n\nThe station began offering international programming from MHz Networks-owned MHz WorldView in 2010, over digital subchannel 20.2; the network moved to a newly created subchannel on digital channel 20.3 as a result of the addition of FNX on its second subchannel. The subchannel offers a wider variety of English language international news programs, expanding the number of news programs available to viewers who rely on \"over the air\" broadcasting instead of cable or satellite. Some of the programs aired on the subchannel are presented in English, while others are broadcast in their native foreign languages and accompanied by English subtitles, and in Spanish without subtitles. Programs include news programs from Asia, South America and the Middle East (such as Al Jazeera English, Bolivian News, Arab Net News and South Asia News).\n\nWYCC shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, at 6 a.m. on April 16, 2009. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 21. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 20. At the same time, the \"WYCC\" callsign was legally transferred from the now-defunct analog signal to digital channel 21, with the digital signal's pre-transition callsign \"WYCC-DT\" officially being discontinued.\n\nIn the FCC's incentive auction to make more spectrum available for wireless broadband, WYCC sold its spectrum for $15,959,957; at the time, the station indicated that it would enter into a post-auction channel sharing agreement. On September 13, 2017, WYCC announced in a letter to contributors that it would shut down October 25, 2017; most of the station's staff had been laid off following the conclusion of the auction in April. However, prior to September 22, 2017, WTTW approached WYCC with a channel sharing agreement to stay on the air. WYCC then announced in a letter to employees that it would remain on the air through November 24; if a channel sharing agreement was reached, operation of WYCC's channels would be handled by WTTW, with a tentative plan to use \"a combination of WYCC and WTTW brands and programming\". The deadline to file a plan with the FCC was November 24, 2017. In 2016, WYCC had an annual budget of $8.2 million, of which Chicago City Colleges provided $5.7 million. The station lost $732,000 in 2016 in its non-operating budget, despite funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the state of Illinois and private donors.\n\nThrough its ownership by the City Colleges of Chicago, WYCC provided distance learning courses as part of its late night schedule, which could be credited towards an associate degree—when viewed—at any of the City Colleges campuses. The colleges also used WYCC to air informational programs for neighborhood outreach and community service purposes.\n\nAs a PBS member station, WYCC also provided a relatively limited schedule of children's programming provided by the service as well as through independent distributors such as American Public Television, mainly airing on weekday mornings.\n\nThe station produced several locally based programs including the political talk show \"Beyond the Beltway\", which also airs nationally on radio. In 2013, WYCC debuted \"In the Loop\", a half-hour weekly public affairs show on Thursday evenings, hosted by Barbara Pinto and Chris Bury (both of whom formerly served as correspondents for ABC News); Robin Robinson and Lauren Cohn (both former anchors at Fox owned-and-operated station WFLD, channel 32) joined the program as rotating co-hosts starting in September 2015.\n\nThe station formerly produced the public affairs and editorial program \"Off 63rd with Garrard McClendon\". Airing on Thursday evenings, and funded by the McCormick Foundation and the Field Foundation, the show was hosted by professor and author Dr. Garrard McClendon. It also produced \"The Professors\", a half-hour weekly program on Sunday mornings featuring a panel of professors from the City Colleges of Chicago campuses discussing education-related issues.\n\nThe station has aired Pritzker Military Presents since 2006.\n\nIn 2010, the station began incorporating many \"how to\" shows on its weekday afternoon and Saturday midday schedules, featuring a mix of sewing, quilting, cooking, art/painting, gardening and home improvement programs from American Public Television and other distributors.\n\nWYCC broadcast numerous international programs.\n\nWYCC carried mystery programs from PBS' anthology series \"Masterpiece\", as well as twice weekly airing of those produced by BBC Worldwide Americas (such as \"DCI Banks\") in prime time on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Several British series have aired on the station, including \"The Café\" and \"Lead Balloon\".\n\nIn 2010, the station began carrying reruns of Canadian sitcom \"The Red Green Show\". WYCC also served as the Chicago-area broadcaster of \"Out of Ireland\". The station formerly carried other British and Irish imports including \"Tartan TV\" (which focuses on Scotland), \"Monarch of the Glen\", \"Last of the Summer Wine\", \"Are You Being Served?\", \"New Tricks\", \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", the Irish comedic soap opera \"Ballykissangel\", and (in 2010), the British serial drama \"Touching Evil\".\n\nWYCC and WTTW show a similar number of scripted British programmes, with both airing \"Antiques Roadshow\" and \"Masterpiece\", though at different air dates. WYCC has aired the BBC One programme \"Lark Rise to Candleford\" (which began in the UK in 2008) since 2009; and \"Midsomer Murders\" (which first aired in the UK in 1997) in November 2010. Mystery series presented on the station expanded in 2013 and 2014 to include \"Vera\", \"DCI Banks\", and the Australian series \"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries\". In the late 2010s, WYCC expanded their format with German, Swedish, and Norwegian mystery shows. With its large variety of mystery programs, WYCC runs two-day mystery marathons on some holidays, tied with fundraising.\n\nWYCC carried local news programs produced by undergraduate and graduate students from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, with students from the City Colleges of Chicago contributing in the production of these shows. WYCC also produced programs for the Illinois gubernatorial and Assembly elections during the 2010 and 2012 fall election seasons.\n\nIn the early 2010s, WYCC altered its program lineup, acquiring new program offerings from the BBC and using the English language international news shows available to offer news and opinions not provided elsewhere, particularly for viewers who watch broadcast television over-the-air in the Chicago area market. The station offered comprehensive international news coverage and national news discussion programs from DW TV's \"Journal\", France 24, \"NHK Newsline\", RT News and Euronews. The station also broadcasts news/talk shows programs distributed for public television syndication such as those hosted by Charlie Rose and Tavis Smiley.\n\nIn 2013, WYCC began airing the PBS series \"Just Seen It\", featuring various entertainment industry people providing reviews of movies and television programs, with a quick format reflecting the original Siskel/Ebert movie review program \"At the Movies\", recommending viewers to see, skip or stream the reviewed media.\n\nWYCC was one of the very few PBS stations not to air \"PBS Newshour\", as WTTW airs these newscasts.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972398", "title": "Araby (short story)", "text": "Araby (short story)\n\n\"Araby\" is a short story by James Joyce published in his 1914 collection \"Dubliners.\"\n\nThrough first-person narration, the reader is immersed at the start of the story in the drab life that people live on North Richmond Street, which seems to be illuminated only by the verve and imagination of the children who, despite the growing darkness that comes during the winter months, insist on playing \"until [their] bodies glowed.\" Even though the conditions of this neighbourhood leave much to be desired, the children's play is infused with their almost magical way of perceiving the world, which the narrator dutifully conveys to the reader:\n\nBut though these boys \"career\" around the neighbourhood in a very childlike way, they are also aware of and interested in the adult world, as represented by their spying on the narrator's uncle as he comes home from work and, more importantly, on Mangan's sister, whose dress “swung as she moved” and whose “soft rope of hair tossed from side to side.” These boys are on the brink of sexual awareness and, awed by the mystery of another sex, are hungry for knowledge.\n\nOn one rainy evening, the boy secludes himself in a soundless, dark drawing-room and gives his feelings for her full release: \"I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: O love! O love! many times.\" This scene is the culmination of the narrator's increasingly romantic idealization of Mangan's sister. By the time he actually speaks to her, he has built up such an unrealistic idea of her that he can barely put sentences together: “When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me if I was going to Araby. I forget whether I answered yes or no.” But the narrator recovers splendidly: when Mangan's sister dolefully states that she will not be able to go to Araby, he gallantly offers to bring something back for her.\n\nThe narrator now cannot wait to go to the Araby bazaar and procure for his beloved some grand gift that will endear him to her. And though his aunt frets, hoping that it is not “some Freemason affair,” and though his uncle, perhaps intoxicated, perhaps stingy, arrives so late from work and equivocates so much that he almost keeps the narrator from being able to go, the intrepid yet frustrated narrator heads out of the house, tightly clenching a florin, in spite of the late hour, toward the bazaar.\n\nBut the Araby market turns out not to be the most fantastic place he had hoped it would be. It is late; most of the stalls are closed. The only sound is \"the fall of the coins\" as men count their money. Worst of all, however, is the vision of sexuality—of his future—that he receives when he stops at one of the few remaining open stalls. The young woman minding the stall is engaged in a conversation with two young men. Though he is potentially a customer, she only grudgingly and briefly waits on him before returning to her frivolous conversation. His idealized vision of Araby is destroyed, along with his idealized vision of Mangan's sister—and of love. With shame and anger rising within him, he is alone in Araby.\n\n\"Araby\" touches on a great number of themes:\n\n\nThese themes build on one another entirely through the thoughts of the young boy, who is portrayed by the first-person narrator, who writes from memory.\n\n\"Araby\" contains many themes and traits common to Joyce in general and \"Dubliners\" in particular. As with many of the stories in the collection, \"Araby\" involves a character going on a journey, the end result of which is fruitless, and ends with the character going back to where he came from. \"Eveline\" is just one other story in \"Dubliners\" to feature a circular journey in this manner. Also, the narrator lives with his aunt and uncle, although his uncle appears to be a portrait of Joyce's father, and may be seen as a prototype for Simon Dedalus of \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" and \"Ulysses\". The scorn the narrator has for his uncle is certainly consistent with the scorn Joyce showed for his father, and the lack of \"good\" parents is pertinent.\n\nIn \"The Structure of Araby,\" Jerome Mandel notes the shared plot archetypes between “Araby” and traditional medieval romantic literature, positing that Joyce deliberately “structured with rigorous precision upon a paradigm of medieval romance.”\n\nAmong later writers influenced by \"Araby\" was John Updike, whose oft-anthologized short story, \"A&P\", is a 1960s American reimagining of Joyce's tale of a young man, lately the wiser for his frustrating infatuation with a beautiful but inaccessible girl. Her allure has excited him into confusing his emergent sexual impulses for those of honor and chivalry, and brought about disillusionment and a loss of innocence.\n\n\n"}

He served U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford in the White House in various positions from 1969 to 1976, including Counselor to the President, acting Special Counsel to Nixon for the last two years of his presidency, and U.S. Ambassador to the Third Committee at the United Nations.\n\nGarment was born in Brooklyn, New York. In 1949, he graduated from Brooklyn Law School and joined the law firm of Mudge, Stern, Baldwin, and Todd. He became the head of litigation and a partner in the late fifties. (Later the firm would be called Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander.) Garment met Richard Nixon when the politician joined the firm in 1963. He assisted with Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. In 1969, Garment became a part of Nixon's White House staff as special consultant to the president. He advised the president and worked on various special projects—particularly in the areas of civil and human rights, Indian affairs, and the arts.\n\nGarment was the author of two books: the autobiography \"Crazy Rhythm: From Brooklyn and Jazz to Nixon's White House, Watergate, and Beyond, \" and \"In Search of Deep Throat: The Greatest Political Mystery of Our Time\". Published in 2000, the latter book supported the theory that Deep Throat was John Sears. Before Deep Throat's identity was revealed in 2005 as being former FBI Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt, Garment himself was a suspect.\n\nFelt was listed as a possible Deep Throat in the book (as are many others), but was dismissed by Garment because the author believed the secret source had to have strong White House connections. He was mistaken in his selection of Sears, who told Garment explicitly that he was not Deep Throat. To prove his argument, Sears admitted that he was an anonymous source for Carl Bernstein, but Garment still didn't believe Sears, a longtime friend, was being truthful about not being Deep Throat.\n\nGarment had a long association with the arts, starting with his early career as a jazz saxophonist with Woody Herman's band playing with Alan Greenspan before he entered law school. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. More recently, he was one of the founders of the Jazz Museum in Harlem. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2005 as an arts advocate and patron. \nTim Russert credited Leonard Garment with getting him into the news business as Garment had a friend at NBC News who was looking to rebuild their news division. Garment and Russert had previously worked together in 1976 during the U.S. Senate election of Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\nGarment was a close associate of I. Lewis (\"Scooter\") Libby, as law partners, at Dechert, Price & Rhoads.\n\nGarment, who had been ill, died July 13, 2013, at his Manhattan home. He was 89.\n\n"}

Situated in the Dublin suburb of Inchicore, it is the home ground of League of Ireland side St Patrick's Athletic F.C. (also known as St Pat's). The area where the ground now stands was formerly used as a recreational area by the British Army, who were stationed at the nearby Richmond Barracks, both named after Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond the barracks having since been demolished.\n\nAfter the creation of the Irish Free State, and therefore the removal of the British Army, the ground lay idle for 3 years before League of Ireland club Brideville began using the ground in 1925. In 1930 Brideville were forced to move to Harolds Cross Greyhound Stadium to accommodate St Patrick's Athletic moving in. St. Pats continues to use and develop the ground until 1951 when they entered the League of Ireland. The league deemed the ground unsuitable and St. Pats were forced to use a variety of grounds in Dublin as they fought to upgrade Richmond Park. In 1960, after serious development, the ground played host to St Pats first home league game in Inchicore. The ground closed for redevelopment in May 1989, however due to St Pats hitting financially difficulties they did not return until 5 December 1993.\n\nThe ground lies behind a row of terraced housing in a natural valley and is often used for Republic of Ireland underage and women's teams. It staged the League of Ireland Cup final in 1982 and 2003. It has played host to a two Leinster Senior Cup finals, as well as many junior and intermediate finals. In 2001, 2002, 2003 and part of 2004 Shamrock Rovers played their home games in Richmond Park as tenants of St. Pats. In 2005, Dublin City played the first 10 games of their season in the ground, under a similar arrangement. Richmond Park is usually used by non-league clubs in surrounding areas when they qualify for the FAI Cup.\n\nIt staged its first European game in July 1996 when Slovan Bratislava visited in a 1996-97 UEFA Cup tie.\n\nIn 2005, the board of St. Patrick's Athletic F.C. spoke to their fans about a potential move to a new municipal stadium in Tallaght where they would share with Shamrock Rovers. Outraged by this, the club's fans revolted and a pressure group called 'Pats for Richmond' was set up to mobilise and organise opposition to the plan. In July 2006, St. Pats board of directors gave a clear indication of staying put by purchasing local pub Richmond House (also known as McDowells) in order to give the club's fans a social base.\n\nIn 2006 the club qualified for Europe for the first time since 2002 via the 2006 FAI Cup Final and with the club needing a bigger seating capacity to play in the UEFA Cup, the grass bank behind the Inchicore End goal was dug up and levelled out with concrete and a new temporary stand was built made up of a metal frame and wooden boards. In 2011, at the UEFA Europa League clash between Pats and ÍBV of Iceland, a supporter fell through one of the wooden boards while celebrating a goal. This led to the top half of the stand being closed for the next round against Shakhter Karagandy from Kazakhstan and the stand being closed entirely for the remainder of the 2011 season. Before the start of the 2012 season, any wooden boards that were deemed dangerous were swapped with safe ones from the top half of the stand that remained closed, and the bottom half of the stand was reopened for the Saints 5-1 hammering of Shamrock Rovers and remained open for the rest of the season. There was only two games that were an exception to the stand being open, the Europa League game, once again against ÍBV, when the UEFA delegate deemed the stand unsafe to use for supporters and the next round of the Europa League against Bosnian side Široki Brijeg when once again the UEFA delegate deemed the stand unsafe, but his decision was overruled by An Garda Síochána due to overcrowding in the Main Stand as a result of the tickets being oversold. Midway through the 2013 season, the St.Pat's Supporters Club, the Patron Saints, donated €50,000 to the club for the stand to be dismantled and rebuilt using metal flooring instead of wooden. The first time the new stand was used was a sold out fixture against Lithuanian side Žalgiris in the UEFA Europe League on 11 July 2013. the stand was officially opened on 27 July 2013 in front of Supporters, Players and Management and given the official name of 'The Patrons' Stand'.\n\nOn 11 April 2018, St Patrick's Athletic announced plans to leave their Richmond Park home in favour of a move across the road to the St Michael's Estate site, with plans to create a 12,000 seater state of the art stadium and shopping facility with the working name of the Richmond Arena, hoping to be ready to play in by 2022 pending Dublin City Council's decision on the site and planning permission being granted.\n\nThe main stand seats 1,800 people. Behind one goal, at the Inchicore end, the space was constructed into a new uncovered stand in time for the 2007 UEFA Cup campaign of St Patrick's Athletic F.C. This stand seats 1,000 and is known as the West (or 'New') Stand. The hardcore St. Pat's supporters have traditionally gathered at the other end, in the 'Shed End', though in more recent times the Shed has housed the away supporters while the more vocal Pat's fans have moved to the main stand. Although known locally as the \"Shed End\" the official name is the John Minnock stand, as it was financed with money received from his transfer to Charlton Athletic. It was originally a fully covered terrace, before half the roof was removed in the early 2000s and the other half in early 2020, leaving it as an uncovered terrace. The camac terrace, across from the main stand, is used by home fans, and named after the river that runs behind it. The Camac holds the ground's TV gantry.\n\nRichmond Park hosted Ireland's first ever outdoor rock festival on 4 September 1970. Headlined by Mungo Jerry, the lineup also featured one of the earliest performances of the then recently formed Thin Lizzy. A crowd of several thousand had been expected but, in the event, widespread rumours of a Garda drugs bust and poor weather kept the attendance to an estimated 800.\n\nList of full international players to have played at Richmond Park.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972432", "title": "Thurgood Marshall College", "text": "Thurgood Marshall College\n\nThurgood Marshall College (Marshall) is one of the six undergraduate colleges at the University of California, San Diego. The college, named after Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice and lawyer for the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, emphasizes \"scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of [one's] role in society.\" Marshall College's general education requirements emphasize the culture of community involvement and multiculturalism; accordingly Marshall houses the minors in Public Service and Film Studies for the campus. Significant academic programs and departments have come out of the college over many decades: Communication, Ethnic Studies, Third World Studies, African American Studies, Urban Studies & Planning, and Education Studies.\n\nFounded as Third College in 1970 amid the student activism of the period, TMC's original aim was to help students understand their own community through a critical examination of diversity and community in the United States. Marshall College's required writing program is called Dimensions of Culture (DOC), and is a 3 quarter (1 year) sequence that explores race, identity, imagination, tradition, and the law in the United States. For the last three years in a row, the White House has honored UC San Diego and Marshall College's Public Service minor and charter school outreach as exemplary community service institutions serving the United States.\n\nThe college is partnered with McDonald’s.\n\nIn November 1965, the College III Preliminary Planning Committee released the first substantial report on what form UCSD's third college would take. The committee, comprising faculty members George Backus, Henry Booker, Gabriel Jackson, C.D. Keeling, and committee chair Andrew Wright, suggested that College III should focus itself on history and theory.\n\nThe Wright Committee report suggested that the college have a muse—namely Clio, the Greek muse of history. History was chosen by the committee because it mixed humanism with science—College III would be a sort of \"common ground\" between the science of Revelle and the humanities of Muir.\n\nIn a quiet act of rebelliousness (or perhaps it was just individuality), the committee planned that College III students would only have to take three courses per quarter to graduate in four years, as opposed to the four it took at the other UCSD colleges. Citing the three-course \"full load\" at UC Santa Cruz, the committee suggested that taking four courses in one quarter would \"make the students ride off in all directions,\" and that three-in depth courses would be preferable.\n\nThe final note of the Wright Committee report described what the committee felt was needed in a College III Provost \"a paragon of intellectual vitality, scholarly accomplishment, and administrative talent... sympathetic with the aims of College III, but independent enough... to be able to shape the College in important ways.\" They asked that a provost be appointed as soon as possible.\n\nBy 1967, College III had found its first provost, Armin Rappaport, a history professor at U.C. Berkeley. It was appropriate that the provost of a college with Clio as its muse would be a historian, and Rappaport was that. By the time May rolled around, College III was now \"Third College.\"\n\nHowever, with the swirling political changes of the late 1960s, the college of Clio and Rappaport was never to be. Once the controversy and battles among students, faculty, and administration commenced—featuring lively figures such as Herbert Schiller, Herbert Marcuse, and Angela Davis—the future of Third College would be in a turmoil that didn't fully clear until it finally received its official name, Thurgood Marshall College, in 1993.\n\nChancellor William J. McGill persuaded Dr. Joseph Watson to become the first operational provost of Third College during this very turbulent time in 1970. Provost Watson's term lasted eleven years as he then assumed a higher campus position as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Professor Faustina Solís then followed as the second college administrator and was also the university's first Latina provost. She served in that capacity from 1981 to 1988. Solís established public health coursework for undergraduates and medical students, following years of social work and health care for under-served populations. She was honored in 1990 when Thurgood Marshall Lecture Hall was renamed the Faustina F. Solís Hall.\n\nAt its inception, students pushed for the new college to be named \"Lumumba-Zapata College\" in honor of the legendary twentieth century revolutionaries Patrice Lumumba and Emiliano Zapata. Unable to get approval for this name from UC Administration, the college was renamed Third College. This name did also inspire the idea that the student body would be one-third white students, one-third black students, and one-third definable minority students. Third College took up much of the activism that the campus was lacking, and the naming controversy was a catalyst for this movement. However, UCSD failed to attract enough black students for this plan to reach fruition and the UC Regents would not allow large scale deviation from the University of California's admission guidelines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, an attempt was made to name the college after Martin Luther King, but failed when UCSD students objected to naming the college after someone who was charged with plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation. More to the point, King's family announced that they would rather see a full-fledged King College built in the South, and preferably in Atlanta.\n\nIn 1993 UCSD's Third College finally received its official name in honor of the famous lawyer and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Before becoming the first African American Supreme Court Justice, Marshall argued the 1954 landmark civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education. Justice Marshall was widely known and recognized for his historic contributions to American life and dedication to breaking down barriers to education, civil rights, freedom of speech, women's rights, and the right to privacy. Today Thurgood Marshall College continues to honor the legacy of its namesake by promoting a curriculum and environment that empowers students to become both scholars and citizens.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Thurgood Marshall College created a core freshman writing program that provided a critical examination of identity and diversity in American culture. The intellectual program was inspired by the University of Chicago and Columbia University's freshman humanities programs. The program, Dimensions of Culture (DOC), periodically generated heated debates among students, families, and alumni, based on difficult political issues.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, a new curriculum controversy arose pertaining to DOC as students at TMC began protesting against the administrators of the college. The Lumumba-Zapata Coalition (which had resurfaced with the addition of graduate students) along with other students claimed that DOC had lost some of its original messages, protesting against what they termed a \"new and diluted\" core writing requirement with a decreased focus on race and the ethnic significance of the individual within society. The protests, including picketing, began with the controversial non-renewal of two DOC Teaching Assistants’ contracts for the subsequent year. Others believed that the coalition was pushing an agenda of political indoctrination that conflicted with the academic goals of the Dimensions of Culture Program and the sensibility of a science oriented campus.\n\nThe protests had mixed effects. In response to the complaints in regards to the curriculum a new committee was set up to review and change the curriculum accordingly with an emphasis on hiring tenured faculty to teach DOC. Student positions with voting rights were included on the permanent committee so an equitable curriculum will be created reflecting full community input from both students and faculty. Thurgood Marshall College Student Council (TMCSC) issued a report recommending that DOC have an upper division course which also sparked the public service course. In August 2009, Co-Director of the DOC Program, Robert Horwitz stated, \"Various criticisms were leveled at DOC in the last few years, and faculty and student investigations concluded that changes needed to be made. Those changes have been implemented and have resulted in a new DOC.” \n\nThurgood Marshall College has created more academic departments and programs than any other college at UCSD, including Third World Studies, Ethnic Studies, Education Studies, African American Studies Minor, and Urban Studies and Planning. TMC is now home to two UCSD Minors: the Public Service Minor and the Film Studies Minor.\n\nThe Public Service Minor encourages students to understand the history and practices of public service and to work towards the development of civic skills. Those skills and practices are essential cornerstones of participation in a democratic society regardless of one's chosen profession. The coursework for the minor emphasizes the history and emergence of the non-profit sector as a national institution distinct from the private and public spheres. The practicum aspects of the minor couples with the traditional academic work encourages students to see the connection between the deeds of charitable service and the historic worth of citizens participation in the common public franchise.\n\nThe Film Studies Minor provides students an exciting opportunity to examine the many facets of American and International cinema. Students interested in exploring cinema as a multidimensional art medium will engage in the analysis of cinematic works of various forms. Study of film genres, history, theories, directors, cultural perspectives and more allow students to gain a robust understanding of cinema as a historical and contemporary means of expression. The interdisciplinary nature of the minor provides investigation of cinematic art through its connection to related fields such as Communication, Literature, Sociology and Visual Arts. Students pursuing the Film Studies Minor exhibit a wide range of interests; from those who plan graduate study in film to those who simply wish to understand better this powerful and influential medium.\n\nThe Morehouse/Spelman Student Exchange Program was officially launched in the fall quarter of 1989. This formal exchange program with two distinguished Historically Black Colleges was developed by Thurgood Marshall College and is open to all UCSD undergraduates. Morehouse College and Spelman College are both located in Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe purpose of the program is to provide a unique opportunity for students to live and study at important institutions of higher learning that are significantly different from the social and educational environment typical of California state colleges and universities. Similarly, the exchange students coming to UCSD from Morehouse and Spelman will have an opportunity to experience an exciting and very different educational environment. Xavier University in New Orleans became the third historic Black college to have this exchange with Marshall College in 2016.\n\nThen Thurgood Marshall College Provost Cecil Lytle and Sociology Professor Bud Mehan were instrumental in founding the Preuss School at UCSD, which opened in 1999 on campus despite strong opposition. The project was seen by faculty as a deviation from UC San Diego's focus on science and medicine. However, providing the impetus for the founding of The Preuss School reflected the social justice oriented mission of Marshall College. Between 2007 and 2012 Preuss has consistently been listed among the top 50 American high schools by both Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report.\n\nAfter Preuss was established successfully, the idea and structure of the UCSD-supported charter school model was expanded to Gompers Preparatory Academy. Based on educational theories, the successes of Preuss should be able to be recreated in a different environment, which was why Gompers was selected. Gompers was historically one of the most dangerous and low performing schools in the district, and yet has been transformed into an academically rigorous school with 100% graduation rate with the transition to the charter school model.\n\nThe College maintains strong links to both charter schools by providing them with hundreds of undergraduate tutors and mentors every year from all six colleges. In addition, the College's Provost is a Preuss School Board Member.\n\nThe artist-in-residence program, begun in 2006, brings to campus leading performers and visual artists from San Diego and Southern California to UC San Diego. Each artist is featured for one year and given the opportunity to develop new showcase work, which often goes on to fuller production off campus. Marshall College is the first college at UCSD to commission public art on campus, and has contributed in the creation of a vibrant campus community. Allan Havis, a professor from the Theatre Department, launched these programs during his term as college provost from 2006 to 2016.\n\nMarshall College is home to an eclectic mix of student-led organizations, programs to facilitate students' success, and opportunities to give back to the Marshall community.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He reached a career-high ATP world No. 9 singles ranking in August 2005. His career highlight of reaching the final of the French Open in 2005 was marred by testing positive for the banned substance etilefrine in a drugs test directly after the French Open final, for which he received an eight-year doping ban.\n\nPuerta made his debut on the ATP Tour in 1997, and turned professional in 1998. He won his first ATP title in 1998 in Palermo, Italy. In 2000, Puerta achieved his highest year-end ranking of World No. 21, reaching five finals, and winning one of them (Bogotá). That same year, however, he underwent wrist surgery, which kept him off the tour for several months.\n\nBesides from not recovering his previous playing level, he was suspended from tennis for 9 months from October 2003 onwards for a doping offense (see section on doping controversies). Owing to the suspension he missed most of the 2004 season, and by August 2004 his world ranking had dropped to No. 440. He was reduced to playing Challenger-level tournaments for a while until he had earned enough points to return to the ATP Tour.\n\nIn 2005, Puerta made an eye-opening comeback on the Tour by winning the title in Casablanca and then making it to the final of the world's most prestigious clay court tournament, the French Open, where he eventually succumbed to Rafael Nadal in a close match (7–6, 3–6, 1–6, 5–7). By August 2005 he had climbed to a career-best World No. 9 in the ATP singles rankings, an advancement of 431 places in one year.\n\nIn December 2005, he was, again, suspended for a doping offense, this time for 8 years, effectively ending his professional career. This suspension was later reduced on appeal.\n\nOn June 6, 2007 Puerta returned to the professional circuit with a 6–4, 6–3 victory over Australian Joseph Sirianni at the Sassuolo Challenger, a tournament to which he was invited as a wild card since he had no ranking. In the second round, Puerta lost 6–3, 6–0 to Spaniard Marc López. Since returning to the tour, Puerta has only played on the ATP Challenger Tour, including winning the Bogota challenger in 2008 and reaching the final of the San Luis Potosi Challenger in 2008 without dropping a set, where he was forced to default the final, and the Cordenons challenger in 2007.\n\nPuerta is left-handed and uses a single-handed backhand. He is an excellent clay-court specialist with a game that revolves around very accurate and powerful groundstrokes off both wings with heavy topspin. His main weaknesses are his mental strength, slow court speed and comparatively weak serve, the latter two which significantly prevents his success on fast surfaces. He is also very capable at the net, having good volleys and quick reflexes despite his slow court speed. \n\nIn 2003, Puerta received a two-year doping suspension after testing positive for clenbuterol at Viña del Mar. In his defence, he argued that the substance had been administered to him by his doctor to combat asthma and that it had no performance-enhancing effect. The sanction was subsequently reduced to nine months suspension, effective from October 2003, and a $5600 fine.\n\nIn December 2005, Puerta was banned again, this time after it was revealed that he had tested positive for the use of the cardiac stimulant etilefrine following his 2005 French Open final loss to Rafael Nadal. The suspension was for eight years, the longest in tennis history at that time. As a result, Puerta was forced to forfeit all of his rankings points and prize money from the 2005 French Open onwards, and had all his 2005 results from after the French Open annulled. Puerta's finish as a finalist at the 2005 French Open was allowed to remain on the record books.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation tribunal noted, however, that \"The amount of etilefrine detected in the positive drugs test was too small to have any effect on his performance\". Puerta appealed against the ban, claiming on his web site that he only ingested trace amounts of it accidentally left over by his wife in a glass. On July 12, 2006 his suspension was reduced to two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, making him eligible to restart his career on June 5, 2007.\n\n\"Walkovers are neither official wins nor official losses\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972444", "title": "M-84", "text": "M-84\n\nThe M-84 is a Yugoslav third generation main battle tank, a variant of the Soviet T-72. The M-84 is still in service in Serbia, Kuwait, Croatia, Slovenia and other countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina use a minimal number.\n\nThe M-84 is based on the Soviet T-72 but with many modifications, including introducing domestic fire-control system that T-72 lacked, improved composite armor, and a 1000-hp engine. The M-84 entered service with the Yugoslav People's Army in 1984. The improved M-84A version entered service a few years later. Other variants where introduced later, most of them are modernization packages.\n\nThere were about 240 Yugoslav factories which directly participated in the production of the M-84 and about 1,000 others which participated indirectly.. Finalist was chosen to be in Đuro Đaković (company) Croatia by Josip Broz Tito, who was born in Croatia, among other proposed manufacturers in Serbia:Goša Smederevska Palanka and Mašinska Industrija Niš that where at time biggest producers of locomotives and wagons in Yugoslavia. Biggest manufacturers directly involved in production of M84 main battle tank in SFR Yugoslavia and Federal republic of Yugoslavia among former republics where:\n\n\nOf all this companies in former Yugoslavia only Serbia currently in 2020. has most capacity to design and built complete tanks including overhaul and modernization with minimal imported parts among following designers and manufacturers:\n\nSerbian version of the M-84 is the M-84AS was unveiled in 2004. It features a new fire control system, Kontakt-5 ERA armor, AT-11 Sniper anti-tank missiles, Agava-2 thermal sight, and the Shtora defensive suite. It is very similar to the Russian T-90S, both in appearance and in capability. Latest version from Serbia M-84AS1 unveiled in 2017. has new fire control system with domestic laser and radar warning system, RCWS 12.7mm and soft active protection suite with new version of domestic reactive armor - ERA.\n\nAbout 150 M-84 tanks were exported to Kuwait. The disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s prevented further exports of the M-84. All sales of M84 including negotiations of contracts with foreign partners where done through Yugoimport SDPR.\n\nThe M-84A is armed with a 125 mm smoothbore cannon derived from the Soviet 2A46. The fume extractor positioned in the middle of the barrel is shielded with a thermal coating that minimizes deformation of the barrel from high temperatures and ensures it is cooled at the same rate during rapid firing. The M-84 uses an automatic loader, which enables it to sustain a firing rate of 8 rounds per minute.\n\nThe cannon's ammunition is stowed underneath the turret (40 rounds) within the hull of the tank. This concept was inherited from the original Soviet design for T-72 and is both a strength and weakness of the tank. While the lower hull beneath the turret is one of the least likely place to be hit and penetrated by antitank rounds or mines it also means that in the event of penetration and secondary detonation of the ammunition the crew and tank are unlikely to survive the resulting catastrophic explosion.\n\nAlong with its primary armament, the M-84 is also armed with one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, and one 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on the commander's turret.\n\nAll versions of the M-84 have a crew of three. The commander sits on the right side of the turret, the gunner on the left, and the driver sits centrally at the front end of the vehicle. Like most Soviet derived vehicles, the M-84 series of tanks do not have a manual loader, due to the tank's autoloader system.\n\nThe basic tank has a cast steel turret with maximal thickness of 410mm; later, in the M-84A version, a segment made out of a non-metal, most likely rubber and boron carbide (see Chobham armour), was sandwiched between layers of steel. The glacis uses laminate armor, glass in plastic resin between two steel plates, in the A version a 16mm steel plate was welded on the glacis. Total armor protection ranges between 550mm-650mm for the glacis and 560mm-700mm for the turret. During the wars in Yugoslavia the M-84's frontal armor proved very effective against any type of AT threat. Side or rear hits often result in a catastrophic ammo explosion.\n\nTwelve smoke grenades are positioned in front of the turret in banks of five and seven grenades. Night vision and gunner's sight are positioned on the top-right side of the turret. The M-84 has a search light used in short-range combat situations.\n\nThe M-84 tank has nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection capabilities.\n\nThe base M-84 engine is a 12-cylinder water-cooled V46-6 diesel engine, rated at 574 kW (780 hp). The improved M-84A has a more powerful, V46-TK 735 kW (1,000 hp) engine. With maximum fuel capacity (1,200 litres) the tank's range is 450 km, and with external fuel tanks, this range can be extended to 650 km.\n\nThe Croatian-made variants have enhanced power plants. The M-84A4 \"Sniper\" model has a German-built 820 kW (1,100 hp) engine, while the M-84D has an 895 kW (1,200 hp) engine, the most powerful of all M-84 variants. The M-84D also has greater fuel capacity (1,450 litres).\n\nThe tank can ford 1.2 meters of water at any time, or up to 5 meters with a snorkel.\n\nM-84 (Yugoslavia) – The initial version based on the Soviet T-72M and produced between 1984 and 1987. Less than 150 units manufactured.\n\n\nPrior to the Persian Gulf War, Kuwait ordered 170 M-84ABs, 15 M-84ABI ARVs and 15 M-84ABK command tanks, from Yugoslavia. Four M-84A tanks were delivered; however, the Iraqi Army soon captured them after the occupation. Further deliveries were stopped for the duration of the war. The Kuwaiti 35th Al-Shaheed Armored Brigade was equipped with 70 M-84s. During the retaking of the country, the 35th Brigade did not directly take part in battles with Iraqi tanks because of the M-84s similarity to Iraqi T-72 or Asad Babils. The M-84 was however very effective against T-62s and T-55s but some unconfirmed reports claim that a few of them were damaged, but recovered and repaired.\n\nDuring the Ten-Day War, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) attempted to regain control over border crossings, airports and other strategic positions in Slovenia. The Slovenian Territorial Defence had no armored units of its own and JNA M-84s were commonly used to break through barricades. Slovenia inherited all the M-84s within its territory, once the ceasefire and Slovenia's independence was accepted.\n\nThe M-84 saw action in the Battle of Vukovar, where the JNA and Serbian forces deployed large columns of main battle tanks in urban areas without the adequate support of the infantry. Tanks and APCs found themselves extremely exposed and suffered significant losses mainly to RPGs.\nIt was noted by anti tank crews that the M-84s were extremely durable in comparison to other vehicles fielded by the JNA. One account from a team in the Battle of Vukovar noted that a single M-84 took 5 rounds from various launchers and direction with a 6th only knocking out its engine forcing its crew to bail out (its main gun being destroyed by a \"lucky\" AT shot from an RPG-7).\n\nDuring the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, M-84s saw little action, the mainstay of all three warring parties being the T-55.\nAt the beginning of the war, JNA units stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina had passed their equipment to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The VRS had several dozen M-84s, with the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina managing to capture only three M-84s. A number of M-84 tanks were used during the Siege of Sarajevo, as well as during smaller localized conflicts. The number of M-84 tanks destroyed during the Bosnian war is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-72 – M-84 – M-91 Vihor – M-84D – M-95 Degman & M-84AS\n\n"}

The bacterium also colonizes the human mouth, mucosae, oropharynx and upper respiratory tract.

Other typical uses are internal and external buses in microprocessors, computer memory, and peripherals. Many devices are controlled by an active-low input called (Output Enable) which dictates whether the outputs should be held in a high-impedance state or drive their respective loads (to either 0- or 1-level).\n\nThe term \"tri-state\" should not be confused with ternary logic (\"3-value\" logic).\n\nThe basic concept of the third state, high impedance (Hi-Z), is to effectively remove the device's influence from the rest of the circuit. If more than one device is electrically connected to another device, putting an output into the Hi-Z state is often used to prevent short circuits, or one device driving high (logical 1) against another device driving low (logical 0).\n\nThree-state buffers can also be used to implement efficient multiplexers, especially those with large numbers of inputs.\n\nThree-state buffers are essential to the operation of a shared electronic bus.\n\nThree-state logic can reduce the number of wires needed to drive a set of LEDs (tri-state multiplexing or Charlieplexing).\n\nMany memory devices designed to connect to a bus (such as RAM and ROM chips) have both (chip select) and (output enable) pins, which superficially appear to do the same thing. If is not asserted, the outputs are high impedance.\n\nThe difference lies in the time needed to output the signal. When chip select is deasserted, the chip does not operate internally, and there will be a significant delay between providing an address and receiving the data. (An advantage of course, is that the chip consumes minimal power in this case.)\n\nWhen chip select is asserted, the chip internally performs the access, and only the final output drivers are disabled by deasserting output enable. This can be done while the bus is in use for other purposes, and when output enable is finally asserted, the data will appear with minimal delay. A ROM or static RAM chip with an output enable line will typically list two access times: one from chip select asserted and address valid, and a second, shorter time beginning when output enable is asserted.\n\nWhen outputs are tri-stated (in the Hi-Z state) their influence on the rest of the circuit is removed, and the circuit node will be \"floating\" if no other circuit element determines its state. Circuit designers will often use pull-up or pull-down resistors (usually within the range of 1–100 kΩ) to influence the circuit when the output is tri-stated.\n\nThe PCI local bus provides pull-up resistors, but they would require several clock cycles to pull a signal high given the bus's large distributed capacitance. To enable high-speed operation, the protocol requires that every device connecting to the bus drive the important control signals high for at least one clock cycle before going to the Hi-Z state. This way, the pull-up resistors are only responsible for maintaining the bus signals in the face of leakage current.\n\nIntel refers to this convention as \"sustained tri-state\", and also uses it in the Low Pin Count bus.\n\nThe open collector input/output is a popular alternative to three-state logic. For example, the I²C bus protocol (a bi-directional communication bus protocol often used between devices) specifies the use of pull-up resistors on the two communication lines. When devices are inactive, they \"release\" the communication lines and tri-state their outputs, thus removing their influence on the circuit. When all the devices on the bus have \"released\" the communication lines, the only influence on the circuit is the pull-up resistors, which pull the lines high. When a device wants to communicate, it comes out of the Hi-Z state and drives the line low. Devices communicating using this protocol either let the line float high, or drive it low – thus preventing any bus contention situation where one device drives a line high and another low.\n\nEarly microcontrollers often have some pins that can only act as an input, other pins that can only act as a push–pull output, and a few pins that can only act as an open collector input/output. A typical modern microcontroller has many three-state general-purpose input/output pins that can be programmed to act as any of those kinds of pins.\n\nA three-state bus is typically used between chips on a single printed circuit board (PCB), or sometimes between PCBs plugged into a common backplane.\n\nUsage of three-state logic is not recommended for on-chip connections but rather for inter-chip connections.\n\nThree-state buffers used to enable multiple devices to communicate on a data bus can be functionally replaced by a multiplexer. That will help select output from a range of devices and write one to the bus.\n\n\n"}

It is one of several isomers of octane (CH). This particular isomer is the standard 100 point on the octane rating scale (the zero point is \"n\"-heptane). It is an important component of gasoline, frequently used in relatively large proportions to increase the knock resistance of the fuel.\n\nStrictly speaking, if the standard meaning of ‘iso’ is followed, the name \"isooctane\" should be reserved for the isomer 2-methylheptane. However, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is by far the most important isomer of octane and so, historically, it has been assigned this name.\n\nIsooctane is produced on a massive scale in the petroleum industry by alkylation of isobutene with isobutane. The process is conducted in alkylation units in the presence of acid catalysts.\nIt can also be produced from isobutylene by dimerization using an Amberlyst catalyst to produce a mixture of iso-octenes. Hydrogenation of this mixture produces 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.\nEngine knocking is an unwanted process that can occur during high compression ratios in internal combustion engines. Graham Edgar in 1926 added different amounts of \"n\"-heptane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane to gasoline, and discovered that the knocking stopped when 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was added. This work was the origin of the octane rating scale. Test motors using 2,2,4-trimethylpentane gave a certain performance that was standardized as 100 octane. The same test motors, run in the same fashion, using heptane, gave a performance which was standardized as 0 octane. All other compounds and blends of compounds then were graded against these two standards and assigned octane numbers.\n\nIn common with all hydrocarbons, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is flammable.\n\n\n"}

Reilly in 1931. According to Reilly's \"law,\" customers are willing to travel longer distances to larger retail centers given the higher attraction they present to customers. In Reilly's formulation, the attractiveness of the retail center becomes the analogy for size (mass) in the physical law of gravity.\n\nThe law presumes the geography of the area is flat without any rivers, roads or mountains to alter a consumer's decision of where to travel to buy goods. It also assumes consumers are otherwise indifferent between the actual cities. In analogy with Newton's law of gravitation, the point of indifference is the point at which the \"attractiveness\" of the two retail centres (postulated to be proportional to their size and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to them) is equal:\n\nWhere formula_2 is the distance of the point of indifference from \"A\", formula_3 is its distance from \"B\", and formula_4 is the relative size of the two centres. If the customer is on the line connecting \"A\" and \"B\", then if \"D\" is the distance between the centres, the point of indifference as measured from \"A\" on the line is\n\nAs expected, for centres of the same size, \"d=D/2\", and if \"A\" is larger than \"B\", the point of indifference is closer to \"B\". As the size of \"A\" becomes very large with respect to \"B\", \"d\" tends to \"D\", meaning the customer will always prefer the larger centre unless they're very close to the smaller one.\n\nIn addition to Newton's Law of Gravity in the physical sciences, there were other antecedents to Reilly's \"law\" of retail gravity. In particular, E.C. Young in 1924 described a formula for migration that was based on the physical law of gravity, and H.C. Carey had included a description of the tendency of humans to \"gravitate\" together in an 1858 summary of social science theory.\n\nReilly's law has many variations, and extensions and applications are numerous.

It is the oldest Irish organisation dealing with the EU, pre-dating Ireland’s membership of the EEC in 1973 by almost twenty years. The organisation is headed by Executive Director, Noelle O'Connell. Maurice Pratt acts as Chairman of the EM Ireland Board.\n\nOn 11 January 1954, one hundred people met in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin and founded the Irish Council of the European Movement. Signing the Articles of Association that founded the European Movement were seven pioneers of Ireland’s future in Europe. They were: Donal O’Sullivan, University Lecturer; Garret Fitzgerald, Economist; Louis P F Smith, Economist; Denis Corboy, Barrister-at-Law; George J Colley, Solicitor; Declan Costello, Barrister-at-Law; and Sean J Healy, Secretary.\n\nThese seven signatories laid the first stone paving Ireland’s way to full membership of the EU. The aim of the Irish Council was to inform Irish individuals and organisations about the EU. One of its primary objectives was for Ireland to gain membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), as the EU was then known. Former Taoisigh Garret Fitzgerald and Jack Lynch, and former President Mary Robinson backed the initiative and Ireland entered the European Communities in 1972.\n\nThe Irish Council later became European Movement Ireland. Today the organisation claims to act as source of information for Irish citizens regarding the work of the EU and its stated aim is to promote reasoned robust and fair debate about EU in Ireland.\nToday European Movement Ireland chiefly promote their aims through sending their speakers to influence public opinion through events such as the Mac Gill summer school in Donegal, using their contacts in the Irish print and radio media to portray the European Union in a favorable light, and by ensuring that the extent of anti European integration feeling in Ireland is hidden by commissioning highly partial polls through their affiliates in Red C and other polling companies and promoting the results at home and internationally.\n\nEuropean Movement Ireland is part of a pan-European network. European Movement International is a lobbying association that coordinates the efforts of associations and national councils with the goal of promoting European integration, and disseminating information about it. It seeks to encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens and civil society organisations in the European Union as it develops. The European Movement network is represented in over 41 countries and has over 20 international organisations as members. The current President of European Movement is German MEP Jo Leinen.

It is the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa. The camp is operated by U.S. Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia; CJTF-HOA is the most notable tenant command located at the facility as of 2008.\n\nCamp Lemonnier was originally established as garrison for the French Foreign Legion. The base was leased by Djibouti to the United States in 2001, along with the right to use the neighboring airport and port facilities. The base supports Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA) and is the centerpiece of a network of around six U.S. drone and surveillance bases stretching across the continent. The latter air bases are smaller and operate from remote hangars situated within local military bases or civilian airports. Due to its strategic location, Camp Lemonnier also serves as a hub for aerial operations in the Persian Gulf region.\n\nDjibouti is strategically located by the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which separates the Gulf of Aden from the Red Sea and controls the approaches to the Suez Canal. As a result, the country hosts many other foreign military bases, including a Chinese naval base, a French airbase, an Italian Support Base and a Japanese base. Unlike French troops, who are allowed to enter Djibouti city and interact with the locals, US troops may only leave Camp Lemonnier by special permission, and most of Djibouti City is off limits.\n\nCamp Lemonnier is located in the town of Ambouli on the southern side of the Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport, between the runway overflow areas and a French military munitions storage facility. After use by the French Foreign Legion, the facility was operated by the Djibouti Armed Forces. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. decided to start counter-terrorism efforts. At first, this was limited to focused attacks, but in 2002 the U.S. government realized that to reduce extremism would require long term engagement with the local governments and populations. As a result, it established the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa to conduct stability operations in the area. In November 2002, the CJTF-HOA staff, a Marine-based organization, arrived off the coast of Djibouti aboard , a naval command ship.\n\nWhile the intent was to move ashore, the Camp Lemonnier facilities which had not been in use for several years were in a state of disrepair. Some buildings were concrete shells and had been stripped of interior fixtures, pipes and wiring, while the roofs of several structures had collapsed. Goats roamed the property and birds had taken roost in several of the abandoned structures. The former swimming pool had been used as a trash dump. Some buildings that were closer to the Djiboutian Air Force controlled side of the airport were in better shape and required minimal renovation. As a result, the CJTF-HOA staff remained aboard the USS \"Mount Whitney\" as the U.S. Army (Bravo Company, 46th Engineer Battalion (CBT)(HVY)) began renovations. (Camp Physical Security was first established by Marines from 2D Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST Co) and was handed over to the 551st Military Police Company, 101st Airborne Division) This involved building new concrete pads, maintenance facilities and living areas. In May 2003, Camp Lemonnier was livable and CJTF-HOA transitioned from the \"Mount Whitney\" to the camp. The pool was cleaned, refurbished, and opened in spring of 2003.\n\nIn January 2007, it was announced Camp Lemonnier would be expanded from to nearly . As part of the process of moving Lemonnier from an \"expeditionary\" base to a long term facility, the camp built a billeting area with rows of Containerized Living Units (CLUs) with concrete sidewalks and gravel roads. As the CLU area expanded, the camp population moved from tents into the more durable berthing facilities.\n\nLemonnier originally belonged to the French military, and was named after General Émile-René Lemonnier. In 2009, after years of misspelling, the U.S. Navy officially changed the camp's name to properly reflect the spelling of General Lemonnier's name.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, US officials confirmed that US Navy SEALs had rescued two foreign hostages in Somalia, an American woman and Danish man, taking them to Camp Lemonnier. Demining workers, the captives had been abducted on 25 October 2011 in the north-central Galkayo area, allegedly by gunmen operating on behalf of a private source who threatened to sell them to Al-Shabaab if their demands were not met.\n\nAs of May 2013, the US had prepared plans for a $1.4 billion expansion of the base and to increase its special forces there to more than 1,000.\n\nIn May 2014, U.S. President Obama and Djiboutian President Guelleh agreed on a 20-year extension of the American lease, at $63 million a year in rent – about double its previous rate. The US is in the process of expanding the base and plans to spend $1.4 billion upgrading the facility over the next two decades.\n\nIn 2017, China opened a base nearby. From that military base laser beams originated, injuring the eyes of American Air Force pilots. China denied that they were the source of the lasers.\n\nCombined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) began moving all headquarters personnel and equipment from its flagship, USS \"Mount Whitney\", in the Gulf of Aden, into facilities at Camp Lemonnier on 6 May 2003.\n\nDjiboutian workers were instrumental in preparing the newly renovated camp for movement of the CJTF headquarters ashore. More than 1,200 local and third-country national construction and support personnel currently work at the camp. KBR administers the contract for facilities and support operations for the camp.\n\nOn 1 July 2006, the U.S. Marine Corps turned over responsibility for Camp Lemonnier to the U.S. Navy in a brief change of command ceremony. U.S. Navy Captain Robert Fahey assumed command of Camp Lemonnier from U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Gerard Fischer.\n\nIn early July 2006, the U.S. and Djiboutian governments also announced that a lease agreement had been signed to expand Camp Lemonnier from to nearly 500 acres (2 km²). The term of the lease was for five years, with options to renew. As part of the lease and expansion, physical improvements to the camp included fencing, additional billeting to replace existing tents, and compliance with various U.S. force protection standoff requirements.\n\nBy 2009, the base began expansion again. According to OSGEOINT, the base received a parallel taxi-way and a new auxiliary support apron. In the following year (2011), open source satellite imagery showed Camp Lemmonier with a new drone apron supporting the RQ/MQ-1 Predator. Furthermore, Camp Lemmonier has been described by \"The Economist\" as \"the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of Afghanistan\", with drones conducting missions in adjacent Yemen and Somalia.\n\nCamp Lemonnier became the hub for black and white SOF operations into nations such as Somalia and Yemen. Also based there is the SOCCE-HOA (Special Operations Command and Control Element-Horn of Africa) – which commands all SOCOM units assigned to training or operational missions in the region including elements of JSOTF-TS (Joint Special Operations Task Force-Trans Sahara) and Naval Special Warfare Unit 10. It also coordinates a rotational detachment of US Army Special Forces which conducts foreign Internal Defence training in counterinsurgency in both Djibouti and in countries such as Mali. In a separate secure compound within the base there are an estimated 300 JSOC personnel: special operators, intelligence and imagery analysts and a dedicated UAV cell. The UAV cell is commanded by a JSOC Major and tasks a flight of 8 MQ-1 Predators conducting operations over Somalia, Mali and Yemen, the Predators have been carrying out strikes and surveillance missions from Camp Lemonnier since late 2010. Prior to that, both CIA and JSOC had used the base as a temporary forward location for Predator and Reaper sorties into the region.\n\nIn October 2011, a squadron of USAF F-15E was deployed to the base and have flown numerous combat missions into Yemen in support of both Yemeni government forces and unilateral strikes directed by JSOC and the CIA targeting cells. Along with the UAV's and F-15E's, surveillance flights are conducted by Air Force Special Operations Command U-28As, that are outfitted with sophisticated signals intercept equipment and optical sensors, which can provide real-time intelligence for ground operators.\n\nIn 2013, the UAV's operating out of the base were moved to Chabelley Airport – which increased operational security and allayed local fears after a UAV and its Hellfire missile crashed in a Djibouti suburb.\n\nOn 1 October 2008, responsibility for the task force was transferred from the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) to United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM) as the latter assumed authority over the African theater of operations.\n\nGround forces\n\nCamp Lemonnier is operated by Commander, Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, which is responsible for its expansion, upkeep, and logistics support. Tenant units include the U.S. Marine Security Forces which provides the camp's external security, the CJTF-HOA commander and staff, a U.S. Navy Seabee battalion which conducts water-well drilling operations, U.S. Army units which provide additional security, military training, and Civil-military operations support, and several aircraft detachments.\n\nPast tenant units have included the U.S. Marine 9th Provisional Security Force; 2nd Battalion, 18th Field Artillery Regiment; and 1–65th Infantry Regiment, A Company, 1-16 Infantry, 1st Infantry division out of Kansas was there 2006–2007, Puerto Rico Army National Guard as well as the USAF's First Red Horse Group. 2nd 137th CAB from Kansas, had duties in Force Protection. While the 2-137 IN was there, the unit received a MUC for duties. The dates of deployment was from June 2010 to April 2011. The 3-124 CAV (R&S), a Texas Army National Guard unit, provided force protection for Camp Lemonnier and other support for the CJTF-HOA until being relieved by the 2-138th FAR from the Kentucky Army National Guard.\n\nAviation units\n\nThe 449th Air Expeditionary Group is U.S. Air Force component to CJTF-HOA and is assigned to Camp Lemonnier. The 449th AEG is currently composed of HC-130P Hercules aircraft assigned to the 81st Expeditionary Rescue Squadron and pararescuemen assigned to the 82nd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron. While deployed the group performed both combat and civil search and rescue missions.\n\nAircraft detachments include a U.S. Marine heavy-lift helicopter (CH-53) detachment, a U.S. Marine assault-support MV-22 Osprey detachment, a U.S. Navy P-3 detachment (technically a part of the US Navy's 6th Fleet – Commander Task Force 67), USAF aircraft include HC-130P Hercules, and, at times, a C-17 Globemaster III detachment.\n\n\n"}

The Institute is named after New Jersey Assemblyman John S. Watson, the first African American to serve as the state's Chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee.\n\nThomas Edison State College established the institute in response to the expressed needs of decision-makers across New Jersey to have a resource for researching public policy. The approach of the institute is to apply the resources of higher education to public policy decisions in a practical and hands-on manner. The institute provides practical research, technical assistance, and other expertise. It supports the capacity of decision-makers to address the most critical issues facing New Jersey. The institute's work is driven by the needs of the decision-makers themselves, not by the internal academic or political agenda of the college.\n\nThe Watson Institute places emphasis on developing long-term partnerships rather than short-term consulting relationships. The institute's goal is to support and strengthen partners' ability to address critical issues as they arise, rather than focusing narrowly on a particular crisis or \"hot issue\" and departing. Abstract, theoretical issues, and policy aftermaths are avoided, with the focus being on forward-looking solutions to practical issues.\n\nThe work at the institute has made various types of progress in the realm of public policy.\n\n\nIn responding to the needs of its partners, the Watson Institute is able to access the best available resources and expertise from across the state and throughout the nation. It is able to use the college's distance learning resources and apply them to the arena of public policy. The institute makes available the academic resources, databases, and analytic tools necessary to support appropriate action and respond to specific needs. This might include research into current \"best practices\" in a given public policy area, a study by an available expert into the effectiveness of current systems, or the collection and analysis of key data.\n\nThe Watson Institute also provides resources other than information to its partners. This includes strategic planning and organizational development assistance, helping to secure financial or volunteer labor resources, publishing and disseminating materials, and other assistance to facilitate effective policy making and action.\n\nThe institute enhances its partners' effectiveness by creating linkages and opportunities for collaboration.

She was named after Gerardus Mercator (1512–1594), a Belgian cartographer. She was designed by G.L. Watson & Co. and built in Leith, Scotland and launched in 1932.\n\nBesides being a training a ship, she was also used, mainly before World War II, for scientific observations, or as ambassador for Belgium on world fairs and in sailing events.\n\nIn 1961, she became a floating museum, first in Antwerp and, from 1964, in the marina of Ostend, just in front of the city hall. As of 2019, she remains open to visitors.\n\"Mercator\" is a composite rigging. The foremast carries square sails, the main mast and the mizzen mast are rigged with fore and aft-sails. Usually the Mercator carried 15 sails with a total surface of about 1600 m². By fair wind she could easily make 13 knots.\n\n\"Mercator\"'s real career started off in 1934 when the ship sailed from Pitcairn Island, Tahiti, Papeete, to the Marquis Islands and Honolulu for a Belgo-French scientific expedition. This was her seventh cruise and known to be a fairly remarkable one to those preceding World War Two. At the end of this expedition, two of the famous Easter Island statues were donated by the Chilean government, one to France and one to Belgium. Both statues were transported back to Europe on board the Mercator.\n\nIn 1936 Ostend's Mercator had the great honor of bringing home the remains of the Flemish missionary and apostle of the lepers, Pater Damiaan, from Molokai island.\n\nOn February 21, 1940, \"Mercator\" set out for her last cruise before World War 2. She sailed to Rio de Janeiro and afterward arrived in Boma.\n\nFrom early 1945 to mid 1947, the ship was under the custody of the British Admiralty as a \"Submarine Depot Ship\". Unfortunately after 1947 the once elegant ship would not be able to put to sea again until January 20, 1951. After her horrible experience in Great Britain, the ship went back to Belgium to receive extensive maintenance work.\n\nIn 1951, \"Mercator\" returned to service as a training ship and completed 41 voyages, sailing almost all seas. After that she performed quite a few scientific missions.

He was the son of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron and of Catherine, daughter of Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper.\n\nThe only resident peer in late colonial America, Fairfax administered his vast Northern Neck Proprietary — a Virginia land grant dating back to 1649 — from his wilderness estate at Greenway Court, Virginia. Various place names in Northern Virginia and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia are named for himmost notably Fairfax County, Virginia and the independent City of Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nBorn in Kent, England at Leeds Castle — owned by his maternal Culpeper ancestors since the 1630s — Lord Fairfax succeeded to his title in 1709. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford University between 1710 and 1713 and afterward held a commission in the Royal Horse Guards (1721–1733). He was a contributor to the early newspaper \"The Spectator\".\nIn 1719, Fairfax came into possession of the vast Culpeper family estates in Virginia's Northern Neck Proprietary between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers. These lands included a great portion of the Shenandoah and South Branch Potomac valleys, in all consisting of some 5,282,000 acres (21,380 km²). Struggling to keep up an expensive lifestyle and maintain Leeds Castle, Fairfax relied on the income from his Virginia tract, both from the sale of land and the annual quit rents, paid by planters who settled in the Northern Neck. These rents were collected by his resident land agent, Robert \"King\" Carter (1662–1732). In the fall of 1732, Fairfax read Carter's obituary in the London monthly \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" and was astonished to read of the vast personal wealth Carter had accumulated, which included £10,000 in cash: this at a time when the Governor of Virginia was paid an annual salary of £200. Rather than appoint another Virginian to the position, Lord Fairfax arranged to have his cousin Colonel William Fairfax move in 1734 from Massachusetts to Virginia to serve as his resident land agent.\n\nLord Fairfax travelled to Virginia for the first time between 1735 and 1737 to inspect and protect his lands. In 1738, about thirty farms were established as part of his Patterson Creek Manor near present-day Burlington, Mineral County, West Virginia. The northwestern boundary of his Northern Neck Proprietary, which had been contested by the English Privy Council, was marked in 1746 by the \"Fairfax Stone\" at the headwaters of the North Branch Potomac River. Returning to America in 1747, he first settled at Belvoir (present-day Fort Belvoir), an estate which had been completed by Col. Fairfax six years earlier. That year he also set aside land for his personal use at Swan Pond Manor (located near present-day Martinsburg, Berkeley County, West Virginia). He then became active in developing his lands and collecting ground rents.\n\nFairfax was the only resident peer in the Thirteen Colonies. In 1748, he made the acquaintance of George Washington, then a youth of 16, a distant relative of the Yorkshire Fairfax family. Impressed with Washington's energy and talents, Lord Fairfax employed him (Washington's first employment) to survey his lands lying west of the Blue Ridge.\n\nFairfax, a lifelong bachelor, moved out to the Shenandoah Valley in 1752. At the suggestion of his nephew Thomas Bryan Martin, he fixed his residence at a hunting lodge at Greenway Court, near White Post, Clarke County. \nHere he and Martin lived together in a style of liberal hospitality, frequently indulging in the diversion of the chase. He served as county lieutenant and as justice of the peace for Frederick County which then included Clarke.\n\nThough an avowed Loyalist, Fairfax kept quiet and was known to be close to Washington. He was never insulted or molested. Title to his domain, however, was confiscated during the hostilities by the Virginia Act of 1779. Less than two months after the 1781 defeat of the British army at Yorktown, the 88-year-old Fairfax died at his seat at Greenway Court. He was buried on the east side of Christ Church (Episcopal) in Winchester, Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}

On 21 September 2017, Rane voluntarily left Congress.\n\nOn 1 October 2017, Rane floated a new political party called the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha and indicated to ally with Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nRane launched the Marathi daily \"Prahaar\" on 8 October 2008, under the ownership of Rane Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. While he serves as the Consulting Editor, journalist Madhukar Bhave is the editor of the newspaper.\n\n\n\nIn August 2011, there was a dispute in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly alleging Rane’s involvement in the Adarsh Housing Society scam.\n\nPune-based RTI activist Ravindra Barhate said that Rane, during his tenure as revenue minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP Government in 1998, had returned a prime plot of land in Pune to a person who had already received compensation from the government under the Land Acquisition Act. In 1998 revenue minister Rane, in his position as a quasi-judicial authority, had decided in favour of Datta Bahirat who had given his power of attorney to Rohan Builders. Bahirat through Rohan Builders had sought to return his land that had been acquired by the government for housing flood-affected persons following the rupture of the Panshet Dam at Pune in 1961. Citing a 1994 High Court order, Rane gave back the unused 2.15 lakh sq feet of the 2.75 lakh sq feet to Bahirat on the repayment of '16 lakh to the government exchequer.\n\nIn Jan 2011, a delegation of Shiv Sena leaders met Maharashtra Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, demanding a separate inquiry into alleged land scams which took place during the tenure of the then revenue minister Rane. The Sena leaders alleged that the state lost revenue of crores of rupees after Rane de-reserved several government plots in favour of individuals or private companies. Most of the matters later landed in the court.\n\nIn February 2011, the Bombay High Court issued Rane a notice following allegations that an organisation headed by his wife Neelam misused a plot of land in Andheri leased to the organisation, and built a restaurant on it. A public interest litigation (PIL), filed by Ashok Karangutkar, alleged that the Sindhudurg Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, of which Neelam Rane is president, set up The Jail Restaurant & Lounge in Sindhudurg Bhavan at Four Bungalows, Andheri, on a plot given to it for educational activities.\n\n\n13. महाराष्ट्र : नारायण राणे की आत्मकथा आने की खबर से ही कई नेताओं के छूटे पसीने , ARLive News , 5 May 2019\n\n"}
{"id": "1972565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972565", "title": "Cryptochrome", "text": "Cryptochrome\n\nCryptochromes (from the Greek κρυπτός χρώμα, \"hidden colour\") are a class of flavoproteins that are sensitive to blue light. They are found in plants and animals. Cryptochromes are involved in the circadian rhythms of plants and animals, and possibly also in the sensing of magnetic fields in a number of species. The name \"cryptochrome\" was proposed as a \"portmanteau\" combining the cryptic nature of the photoreceptor, and the cryptogamic organisms on which many blue-light studies were carried out.\n\nThe two genes \"Cry1\" and \"Cry2\" code for the two cryptochrome proteins CRY1 and CRY2. In insects and plants, CRY1 regulates the circadian clock in a light-dependent fashion, whereas, in mammals, CRY1 and CRY2 act as light-independent inhibitors of CLOCK-BMAL1 components of the circadian clock. In plants, blue-light photoreception can be used to cue developmental signals. Besides chlorophylls, cryptochromes are the only proteins known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in vivo.\n\nAlthough Charles Darwin first documented plant responses to blue light in the 1880s, it was not until the 1980s that research began to identify the pigment responsible. In 1980, researchers discovered that the HY4 gene of the plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" was necessary for the plant's blue light sensitivity, and, when the gene was sequenced in 1993, it showed high sequence homology with photolyase, a DNA repair protein activated by blue light. By 1995, it became clear that the products of the HY4 gene and its two human homologs did not exhibit photolyase activity and were instead a new class of blue light photoreceptor hypothesized to be circadian photopigments. In 1996 and 1998, \"Cry\" homologs were identified in \"Drosophila\" and mice, respectively.\n\nCryptochromes (CRY1, CRY2) are evolutionarily old and highly conserved proteins that belong to the flavoproteins superfamily that exists in all kingdoms of life. All members of this superfamily have the characteristics of an N-terminal photolyase homology (PHR) domain. The PHR domain can bind to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor and a light-harvesting chromophore. Cryptochromes are derived from and closely related to photolyases, which are bacterial enzymes that are activated by light and involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. In eukaryotes, cryptochromes no longer retain this original enzymatic activity.\nThe structure of cryptochrome involves a fold very similar to that of photolyase, with a single molecule of FAD noncovalently bound to the protein. These proteins have variable lengths and surfaces on the C-terminal end, due to the changes in genome and appearance that result from the lack of DNA repair enzymes. The Ramachandran plot shows that the secondary structure of the CRY1 protein is primarily a right-handed alpha helix with little to no steric overlap. The structure of CRY1 is almost entirely made up of alpha helices, with several loops and few beta sheets. The molecule is arranged as an orthogonal bundle.\n\nIn plants, cryptochromes mediate phototropism, or directional growth toward a light source, in response to blue light. This response is now known to have its own set of photoreceptors, the phototropins.\n\nUnlike phytochromes and phototropins, cryptochromes are not kinases. Their flavin chromophore is reduced by light and transported into the cell nucleus, where it affects the turgor pressure and causes subsequent stem elongation. To be specific, \"Cry2\" is responsible for blue-light-mediated cotyledon and leaf expansion. \"Cry2\" overexpression in transgenic plants increases blue-light-stimulated cotyledon expansion, which results in many broad leaves and no flowers rather than a few primary leaves with a flower. A double loss-of-function mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana Early Flowering 3 (elf3) and Cry2 genes delays flowering under continuous light and was shown to accelerate it during long and short days, which suggests that Arabidopsis CRY2 may play a role in accelerating flowering time during continuous light.\n\nCryptochromes receptors cause plants to respond to blue light via photomorphogenesis. Cryptochromes help control seed and seedling development, as well as the switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage of development. In Arabidopsis, it is shown that cryptochromes controls plant growth during sub-optimal blue-light conditions.\n\nDespite much research on the topic, cryptochrome photoreception and phototransduction in \"Drosophila\" and \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is still poorly understood. Cryptochromes are known to possess two chromophores: pterin (in the form of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid (MTHF)) and flavin (in the form of FAD). Both may absorb a photon, and in \"Arabidopsis\", pterin appears to absorb at a wavelength of 380 nm and flavin at 450 nm. Past studies have supported a model by which energy captured by pterin is transferred to flavin. Under this model of phototransduction, FAD would then be reduced to FADH, which probably mediates the phosphorylation of a certain domain in cryptochrome. This could then trigger a signal transduction chain, possibly affecting gene regulation in the cell nucleus.\n\nA new hypothesis proposes that in plant cryptochromes, the transduction of the light signal into a chemical signal that might be sensed by partner molecules could be triggered by a photo-induced negative charge within the protein - on the FAD cofactor or on the neighbouring aspartic acid. This negative charge would electrostatically repel the protein-bound ATP molecule and thereby also the protein C-terminal domain, which covers the ATP binding pocket prior to photon absorption. The resulting change in protein conformation could lead to phosphorylation of previously inaccessible phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus and the given phosphorylated segment could then liberate the transcription factor HY5 by competing for the same binding site at the negative regulator of photomorphogenesis COP1.\n\nA different mechanism may function in \"Drosophila\". The true ground state of the flavin cofactor in \"Drosophila\" CRY is still debated, with some models indicating that the FAD is in an oxidized form, while others support a model in which the flavin cofactor exists in anion radical form, •. Recently, researchers have observed that oxidized FAD is readily reduced to • by light. Furthermore, mutations that blocked photoreduction had no effect on light-induced degradation of CRY, while mutations that altered the stability of • destroyed CRY photoreceptor function. These observations provide support for a ground state of •. Researchers have also recently proposed a model in which is excited to its doublet or quartet state by absorption of a photon, which then leads to a conformational change in the CRY protein.\n\nIn sponge eyes, blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is also expressed. Most animal eyes utilize photo-sensitive opsin proteins expressed in neurons to communicate information of the light environment to the nervous system, whereas sponge larvae use pigment ring eyes to mediate phototactic swimming. However, despite possessing many other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the fully sequenced genome of \"Amphimedon queenslandica\", a demosponge larva, apparently lacks a gene for a light-sensitive opsin pigment, suggesting that the sponge's unique eyes might have evolved a novel light-detection mechanism. Research using RNA probes indicated that one of the two cryptochromes, Aq-Cry2, was produced near the sponge's simple eye cells. Aq-Cry2 lacks photolyase activity and contains a flavin-based co-factor that is responsive to wavelengths of light that also mediate larval photic behavior. Defined as an opsin-clade GPCR, it possesses a conserved Shiff base lysine that is central to opsin function. Like other sponges, \"A. queenslandica\" lacks a nervous system. This indicates that opsin-less sponge eyes utilize cryptochrome, along with other proteins, to direct or act in eye-mediated phototactic behavior.\n\nStudies in animals and plants suggest that cryptochromes play a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms. Similarly, cryptochromes play an important role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms in plants. In \"Drosophila\", cryptochrome (dCRY) acts as a blue-light photoreceptor that directly modulates light input into the circadian clock, while in mammals, cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) act as transcription repressors within the circadian clockwork. Some insects, including the monarch butterfly, have both a mammal-like and a \"Drosophila\"-like version of cryptochrome, providing evidence for an ancestral clock mechanism involving both light-sensing and transcriptional-repression roles for cryptochrome.\n\n\"Cry\" mutants have altered circadian rhythms, showing that \"Cry\" affects the circadian pacemaker. \"Drosophila\" with mutated \"Cry\" exhibit little to no mRNA cycling. A point mutation in \"cry,\" which is required for flavin association in CRY protein, results in no PER or TIM protein cycling in either DD or LD. In addition, mice lacking \"Cry1\" or \"Cry2\" genes exhibit differentially altered free running periods, but are still capable of photoentrainment. However, mice that lack both \"Cry1\" and \"Cry2\" are arrhythmic in both LD and DD and always have high Per1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that cryptochromes play a photoreceptive role, as well as acting as negative regulators of Per gene expression in mice.\n\nIn \"Drosophila\", cryptochrome functions as a blue light photoreceptor. Exposure to blue light induces a conformation similar to that of the always-active CRY mutant with a C-terminal deletion (CRYΔ). The half-life of this conformation is 15 minutes in the dark and facilitates the binding of CRY to other clock gene products, PER and TIM, in a light-dependent manner. Once bound by dCRY, dTIM is committed to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n\nAlthough light pulses do not entrain, full photoperiod LD cycles can still drive cycling in the ventral-lateral neurons in the \"Drosophila\" brain. These data along with other results suggest that CRY is the cell-autonomous photoreceptor for body clocks in \"Drosophila\" and may play a role in nonparametric entrainment (entrainment by short discrete light pulses). However, the lateral neurons receive light information through both the blue light CRY pathway and the rhodopsin pathway. Therefore, CRY is involved in light perception and is an input to the circadian clock, however it is not the only input for light information, as a sustained rhythm has been shown in the absence of the CRY pathway, in which it is believed that the rhodopsin pathway is providing some light input. Recently, it has also been shown that there is a CRY-mediated light response that is independent of the classical circadian CRY-TIM interaction. This mechanism is believed to require a flavin redox-based mechanism that is dependent on potassium channel conductance. This CRY-mediated light response has been shown to increase action potential firing within seconds of a light response in opsin-knockout \"Drosophila\".\n\nCryptochrome, like many genes involved in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in mRNA and protein levels. In \"Drosophila\", \"Cry\" mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), with high levels in light and low levels in the dark. This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude. The transcription of the \"Cry\" gene also cycles with a similar trend. CRY protein levels, however, cycle in a different manner than \"Cry\" transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, CRY protein has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night. Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock at the transcriptional level and by light at the translational and posttranslational level.\n\nOverexpression of \"Cry\" also affects circadian light responses. In \"Drosophila\", \"Cry\" overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light. This light regulation of CRY protein levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.\n\nCryptochrome is one of the four groups of mammalian clock genes/proteins that generate a transcription-translation negative-feedback loop (TTFL), along with Period (PER), CLOCK, and BMAL1. In this loop, CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins are transcriptional activators, which together bind to the promoters of the \"Cry\" and \"Per\" genes and activate their transcription. The CRY and PER proteins then bind to each other, enter the nucleus, and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1-activated transcription.\n\nIn mice, \"Cry1\" expression displays circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a brain region involved in the generation of circadian rhythms, with mRNA levels peaking during the light phase and reaching a minimum in the dark. These daily oscillations in expression are maintained in constant darkness.\n\nWhile CRY has been well established as a TIM homolog in mammals, the role of CRY as a photoreceptor in mammals has been controversial. Early papers indicated that CRY has both light-independent and -dependent functions. A study in 2000 indicated that mice without rhodopsin but with cryptochrome still respond to light; however, in mice without either rhodopsin or cryptochrome, \"c-Fos\" transcription, a mediator of light sensitivity, significantly drops. In recent years, data have supported melanopsin as the main circadian photoreceptor, in particular melanopsin cells that mediate entrainment and communication between the eye and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). One of the main difficulties in confirming or denying CRY as a mammalian photoreceptor is that when the gene is knocked out the animal goes arrhythmic, so it is hard to measure its capacity as purely a photoreceptor. However, some recent studies indicate that human CRY may mediate light response in peripheral tissues.\n\nNormal mammalian circadian rhythm relies critically on delayed expression of \"Cry1\" following activation of the \"Cry1\" promoter. Whereas rhythms in \"Per2\" promoter activation and \"Per2\" mRNA levels have almost the same phase, \"Cry1\" mRNA production is delayed by approximately four hours relative to \"Cry1\" promoter activation. This delay is independent of CRY1 or CRY2 levels and is mediated by a combination of E/E'-box and D-box elements in the promoter and RevErbA/ROR binding elements (RREs) in the gene's first intron. Transfection of arrhythmic \"Cry1\" \"Cry2\" double-knockout cells with only the \"Cry1\" promoter (causing constitutive \"Cry1\" expression) is not sufficient to rescue rhythmicity. Transfection of these cells with both the promoter and the first intron is required for restoration of circadian rhythms in these cells.\n\nExperimental data suggests that cryptochromes in the photoreceptor neurons of birds' eyes are involved in magnetic orientation during migration. Cryptochromes are also thought to be essential for the light-dependent ability of \"Drosophila\" to sense magnetic fields. Magnetic fields were once reported to affect cryptochromes also in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" plants: growth behavior seemed to be affected by magnetic fields in the presence of blue (but not red) light. Nevertheless, these results have later turned out to be irreproducible under strictly controlled conditions in another laboratory, suggesting that plant cryptochromes do not respond to magnetic fields.\n\nCryptochrome forms a pair of radicals with correlated spins when exposed to blue light. Radical pairs can also be generated by the light-independent dark reoxidation of the flavin cofactor by molecular oxygen through the formation of a spin-correlated FADH-superoxide radical pairs. Magnetoreception is hypothesized to function through the surrounding magnetic field's effect on the correlation (parallel or anti-parallel) of these radicals, which affects the lifetime of the activated form of cryptochrome. Activation of cryptochrome may affect the light-sensitivity of retinal neurons, with the overall result that the animal can sense the magnetic field. Animal cryptochromes and closely related animal (6-4) photolyases contain a longer chain of electron-transferring tryptophans than other proteins of the cryptochrome-photolyase superfamily (a tryptophan tetrad instead of a triad). The longer chain leads to a better separation and over 1000× longer lifetimes of the photoinduced flavin-tryptophan radical pairs than in proteins with a mere triad of tryptophans. The absence of spin-selective recombination of these radical pairs on the nanosecond to microsecond timescales seems to be incompatible with the suggestion that magnetoreception by cryptochromes is based on the forward light reaction.\n\n"}

Although larger by volume than the photic zone, the bathyal zone is less densely populated. Sunlight does not reach this zone, meaning primary production, if any, is almost nonexistent. There are no known plants because of the lack of sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. It is known as the midnight (also twilight or dark) zone because of this feature.\n\nBecause of the lack of light, some species do not have eyes. Those possessing eyes in this zone include the viperfish and the frill shark. Many forms of nekton live in the bathyal zone, such as squid, large whales, and octopuses. In the bathyal, some of the world's largest whales feed. Sponges, brachiopods, sea stars, and echinoids are also common in the bathyal zone. Animals in the bathyal zone are not threatened by predators that can see them, so they do not have powerful muscles. This zone is difficult for fish to live in since it is especially hard to find nutrients. They have become very energy efficient, and many have slow metabolic rates to conserve energy. The fish are characterized by weak muscles, soft skin, and slimy bodies. The adaptations of some of the fish that live there include small eyes and transparent skin.\n\nExcept where the ocean is exceptionally deep, the bathyal zone extends to the benthic zone on the ocean bed of that part of the continental slope that lies between 1000 and 4000 meters deep.\nThe bathyal zone contains sharks, squid, octopuses, and many different species of fish.

Released by Columbia Records on October 28, 1994, at the peak of the initial stretch of Carey's career, between \"Music Box\" (1993) and \"Daydream\" (1995), the album features cover versions of popular Christmas tunes and original material. Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote all of the original tracks, as well as producing Carey's interpretations of the covered material. Three singles were released from the album, of which \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time and the best-selling holiday ringtone in the United States.\n\nCritical response to the album's contemporary holiday theme was mixed. Some music critics complimented the \"gospel and soul-inflected\" vocals and even called it \"Carey's best record\" to date. Re-released on multiple occasions in various formats since its debut, the album has sold 5.7 million copies in the United States as of December 2019 and has been certified six-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has sold 15 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling Christmas album of all time. On November 1, 2019, a new two-disc edition was released featuring live renditions, newer songs like \"Oh Santa!\" and \"The Star\", and numerous remixes in commemoration of the album's twenty-fifth anniversary.\n\nCarey has expressed her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, and felt the album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, \"Music Box\", there was speculation of a new project in the works; however it was not until October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that \"Billboard\" announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R&B stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.\n\nThroughout the album's development, Carey worked extensively with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she collaborated extensively on \"Emotions\" (1991) and \"Music Box\" (1993). Together, they wrote all three of the album's original songs, as well as producing most of the traditional tracks at The Hit Factory, in New York.\n\n\"Merry Christmas\" boasted a variety of musical arrangements, sounds and genres. Carey's goal was to provide an album that would have a \"Christmas feel\", providing a mixture of soulful tracks, as well as fun and joyous holiday treats. The song \"Jesus, Oh What a Wonderful Child\", produced by Carey, Afannasief, and Holland, was described as an arrangement of a traditional gospel standard that \"really took flight\". The song was recorded in a church, with many live back-up singers and children playing tambourines and other melodious instruments. The goal was to produce a \"real church flavored song\", in which Loris Holland played the keyboards and allowed Carey's voice to \"cut loose\". According to Chris Nickson, Carey's love of gospel music came through on the track, writing, \"[she] led the band without pushing herself forward, letting the song develop and work out, trading lines with the chorus until, after the crescendo, the musicians moved into a fast double time to the end.\"\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", the album's lead single, was described as an \"up-tempo love song, one that could have easily been written for Tommy Mottola\". \"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\", another one of the album's original tracks, was very different from its whimsical predecessor. The song was described as a \"sad ballad\", in line with many of Carey's previous hit singles. The song featured a synthesized orchestra, including keyboard notes courtesy of Afanasieff, during which Carey would sing to her \"long-gone lover, crystallizing the way that Christmas brought memories of the past into focus.\" According to Nickson, it was \"Jesus Born on This Day\", that was the most impressive original track on the album. It was described as a \"full-blown production number\", which again featured synthesized orchestra, as well as a live children's choir. The song's tune was described as \"solemn and hymn-like, but the arrangement, oddly, made it less religious and rather more glitzy, behind the lyrics that overtly praised Jesus.\"\n\nIn addition, Carey recorded a cover of \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\" by Darlene Love, as well as classics such as \"Silent Night\", \"O Holy Night\" and \"Joy to the World\". The latter song, which was used as a promotional single, was remixed several times and sent to various clubs; adding to the album's range of listeners. Record producer and composer, Loris Holland, co-produced some of the albums gospel flavored tracks, including \"Silent Night\", where he arranged the backing vocals and synthesizers. Carey's rendition of \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\", was deemed as \"one of the more playful tracks on the album\", alongside \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\".\n\nIn the \"Los Angeles Times\", Chris Willman wrote that Carey \"attempts her share of girl-group pop amid the quasi-gospel melisma, though still not evidencing as much personality as talent in either style\". \"New York Times\" journalist Jon Pareles was more critical in his review. \"Regardless of backup, Ms. Carey oversings, glutting songs with her vocal tics—like sliding down from the note above the melody note—and turning expressions of devotion into narcissistic displays.\" Chris Dickinson from the \"Chicago Tribune\" called the singer a \"trilling songbird\" and \"over-the-top irritant\" throughout the album, particularly on \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", where she \"sounds like a bush-league Petula Clark\". The newspaper later named it the seventh worst Christmas album ever.\n\nJ. D. Considine was more enthusiastic in \"The Baltimore Sun\". In his opinion, \"Merry Christmas\" \"may look like just another attempt to cash in on Christmas cheer, but is actually the work of someone who genuinely loves this music\". Considine said while Carey's gospel and soul-inflected vocal exercises worked well with the traditional songs, \"the album's real strength is the conviction she brings to otherwise corny fare like 'Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town', while the way she augments 'Joy to the World' with a bit of the Three Dog Night hit is pure genius.\" Steve Morse from \"The Boston Globe\" argued that it was perhaps Carey's best record, on which she abandoned the overly polished sound of her previous albums and \"cut loose with unbridled soul\".\n\nIn a retrospective review, Barry Schwartz of \"Stylus Magazine\" believed \"Merry Christmas\" may have been \"the definitive Mariah Carey album\", finding the singer at \"her absolute creative and commercial peak, her voice still a marvel, her songs and performances still undeniably brilliant\". AllMusic editor Roch Parisien deemed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" the record's highlight while lamenting Carey's \"high opera\" pretensions on \"O Holy Night\" and her dance/club rendition of \"Joy to the World\".\n\n\"Merry Christmas\" was released on November 1, 1994, in the United States and debuted at number thirty on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with 45,000 copies sold in its first week. In its fifth week, the album peaked at number three, with sales of 208,000 copies, but experienced its highest sales in its sixth week (when it was at number six), with another 500,000 copies sold. The album was the second best-selling holiday album that year with a total of 1,859,000 copies sold. It remained in the top twenty for eight weeks and on the \"Billboard\" 200 for thirteen weeks, reentering the chart three times; peaking at number 149 the first time, 115 the second and at 61 the third (it has spent a total of 87 weeks on the chart). On October 1, 2019, \"Merry Christmas\" was certified six-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of six million copies in the US. As of December 2019, the album has sold 5.7 million copies in the US and is one of the best-selling holiday albums in the United States.\n\nOutside the United States, the album experienced its highest sales in Japan, where it sold 2.8 million copies and became the fourth best-selling album by a non-Asian solo artist. In Europe, \"Merry Christmas\" experienced success, being certified Gold in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and United Kingdom. In Australia, the album was certified six-times Platinum, denoting shipments of 420,000 copies and finishing 11th on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) 1994 End of Year Chart.\n\n\"Merry Christmas\" has sold 15 million copies worldwide, and is the best-selling Christmas albums of all time.\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", the album's debut single, was released on October 29, 1994. It was written by Carey and Afanasieff, and was sent to top-forty and adult contemporary stations, with the video having been filmed the year before.\n\nAnother track they wrote, \"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\", was sent to R&B stations in November 1994 as the album's second single.\n\n\"Jesus Born on This Day\", another original song, was sent to Christian and gospel radio stations in 1994 as the first promotional single.\n\nOriginally released as the second promotional single in 1994, \"Joy to the World\" was later commercially released as the album's third single in Australia on November 27, 1995.\n\nCarey released a children's book based on \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" on November 10, 2015, which went on to sell over 750,000 copies.\n\nOn March 21, 2017, Carey announced via her Twitter account that a film based on \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is being developed. A musical film based on \"Merry Christmas\", the plot revolves around a small town—perhaps not unlike Carey's hometown of Huntington, New York—where a ruthless developer wants to turn the land into a large shopping plaza. \"Mariah doesn't want to let that happen,\" says her producing partner Benny Medina. \"Her character uses song and love to keep the Christmas spirit alive.\" According to Carey, the script will be written by \"High School Musical\" writer Peter Barsocchini, but is still in its early stages of production. However, Carey gave \"Daily News\" a few more details regarding the project, saying, \"Since I recorded the Christmas album, I've always wanted to make a movie to go with it, something that people could watch and hear and enjoy every year. I'm into it. I'm all about the holiday season.\"\n\nNotes\n\nSample credits\n\nCredits adapted from AllMusic.\n\nMusicians\n\nTechnical\n\n"}

Theories X, Y and various versions of Z have been used in human resource management, organizational behavior, organizational communication and organizational development.\n\nMcGregor's Theory X states that workers inherently dislike and avoid work and must be driven to it, in contrast to Theory Y which states that work is natural and can be a source of satisfaction when aimed at higher order human psychological needs.\n\nOne Theory Z was developed by Abraham H. Maslow in his paper \"Theory Z\" which was published in 1969 in the \"Journal of Transpersonal Psychology\".\n\nThe second one is the 3D theory which was developed by W. J. Reddin in his book \"Managerial Effectiveness\" (1970).\n\nAnd the other is William Ouchi's so-called \"Japanese management\" style which was explained in his book \"\" (1981); such style was popularized during the Asian economic boom of the 1980s.\n\nFor Ouchi, Theory Z focused on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life with a strong focus on the well-being of the employee, both on and off the job. According to Ouchi, Theory Z management tends to promote stable employment, high productivity, and high employee morale and satisfaction.\n\nAbraham Maslow, a psychologist and pioneer in human motivation, developed a theory of motivation based upon human needs that had three assumptions. First, human needs are never completely satisfied. Second, human behavior is purposeful and motivated by a need for satisfaction. Third, these needs can be classified according to a hierarchical structure of importance from the lowest to highest (Maslow, 1954):\n\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs theory helps the manager to understand what motivates an employee. By understanding what needs must be met in order for an employee to achieve the highest level of motivation, managers are then able to get the most out of production. \n\nTheory X and Theory Y were both developed by Douglas McGregor, a social psychologist interested in the characteristics of successful organizations. McGregor's book, \"The Human Side of Enterprise\" (1960), described Theory X and Theory Y based upon Maslow's original hierarchy of needs. McGregor grouped the hierarchy into a lower order (Theory X) needs and a higher-order (Theory Y) needs. He suggested that management could use either set of needs to motivate employees, but better results could be gained by the use of Theory Y, rather than Theory X (Heil, Bennis, & Stephens, 2000).\n\nLate in his career Maslow focused increasingly on self-transcendence as a human phenomenon and concern. As he explained in his seminal paper titled \"Theory Z\", the motivation for transcendence literally 'transcends' his original hierarchy of needs. So, for example, some people who achieve self-actualization — the highest level of his original pyramid — also achieve a transcendent life orientation, while other self-actualizers do not. On the other hand, some people, like the proverbial \"starving artist,\" value self-transcendence \"ahead\" of all material values, including self-actualization (in the sense of being materially \"successful.\") Hence transcendence for Maslow is not so much an extension of his original pyramid as an orthogonal dimension.\n\nTheory X, Y and Z all play a role in how a company should manage successfully. Maslow believed the ideal organization would harness the human drive for self-transcendence, as well as the motivations of his original pyramid.\n\n"}

Phototropins can be found throughout the leaves of a plant. Along with cryptochromes and phytochromes they allow plants to respond and alter their growth in response to the light environment. Phototropins may also be important for the opening of stomata and the movement of chloroplasts. These blue light receptors are seen across the entire green plant lineage. When Phototropins are hit with blue light, they induce a signal transduction pathway that alters the plant cells' functions in different ways.\n\nPhototropins are part of the phototropic sensory system in plants that causes various environmental responses in plants. Phototropins specifically will cause stems to bend towards light and stomata to open. Phototropins have been shown to impact the movement of chloroplast inside the cell. In addition phototropins mediate the first changes in stem elongation in blue light prior to cryptochrome activation. Phototropin is also required for blue light mediated transcript destabilization of specific mRNAs in the cell. They are present in the guard cell.\n\n"}

The aircraft operating the service was a Douglas DC-6A four-engined propeller airliner, registration first placed into service in 1955.\n\nWhile originally scheduled to depart at 2:45pm, delays due to snowfall pushed departure back to 6:01pm. At takeoff, with a nearly full complement of 95 passengers and 6 crewmembers (3 flight crew and 3 stewardesses), the plane weighed in at , just below maximum takeoff weight. Despite some sliding of the nosewheel on snow-covered pavement, the airplane was cleared to take off via runway 04 (040° magnetic heading), departing to the northeast of the field.\n\nAfter what was described as a normal takeoff roll, the aircraft lifted off. Upon establishing a positive rate of climb, the landing gear and wing flaps were retracted, and the engine power was reduced to the maximum except for takeoff (METO) setting. The aircraft was now gaining altitude, flying on instruments without outside visibility as it headed over Flushing Bay. While the aircraft's clearance instructed that it proceed northeast on a heading of 40° (runway heading), the airplane began a gradual turn to the left. When it had reached a heading of 285° (nearly due west), it overflew Rikers Island. Its altitude was insufficient to clear the trees on the island, and the aircraft crashed, coming to rest within 1,500 feet of the point of first impact. The duration of the flight from takeoff to crash was approximately 60 seconds. The crash resulted in 20 fatalities and 78 injuries among the passengers and several injuries but no fatalities among the crew.\n\nShortly after the crash, Rikers Island department personnel and prison trustees (inmates whose good behavior had earned the guards’ trust) alike ran to the crash in order to help survivors. As a result of their actions, of the 57 inmates who assisted with the rescue effort, 30 were released and 16 received a reduction of six months by the N.Y.C. Parole Board. Governor W. Averell Harriman also granted commutation of sentence to 11 men serving definite sentences: two received a six months reduction; one workhouse and eight penitentiary definites became eligible for immediate release.\n\nAn investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board was hampered by a lack of information about what transpired aboard the aircraft in its final minute, as flight data and cockpit voice recorders had not yet been routinely installed in commercial aircraft. The Board found that the probable cause of the accident was \"The failure of the captain to: 1) properly observe and interpret his flight instruments, and 2) maintain control of his aircraft.\" In layman's terms, the captain lost spatial awareness when he entered the clouds seconds after takeoff, and therefore didn't detect or correct the airplane's deviation from its desired course.\n\nThe flight was the featured story in a book on aviation written by Alvin Moscow, \"Tiger on a Leash\". Told from the hindsight of 1961, it discussed many aspects of passenger flight of the time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972584", "title": "Slipstream genre", "text": "Slipstream genre\n\nSlipstream is a kind of fantastic or non-realistic fiction that crosses conventional genre boundaries between science fiction, fantasy, and literary fiction. The term was coined by cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling in an article originally published in \"SF Eye\" #5, in July 1989. He wrote: \"... this is a kind of writing which simply makes you feel very strange; the way that living in the twentieth century makes you feel, if you are a person of a certain sensibility.\"\n\nSlipstream fiction has consequently been described as \"the fiction of strangeness\" or a form of writing that makes \"the familiar strange or the strange familiar\" through epistemological and ontological questionings about reality. Science fiction authors James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel, editors of \"\", argue cognitive dissonance is at the heart of slipstream, and it is not so much a genre as a literary effect, like horror or comedy. Similarly, Christopher Priest, in his introduction to Anna Kavan's genre-defying but arguably slipstream novel \"Ice\", writes \"the best way to understand slipstream is to think of it as a state of mind or a particular approach, one that is outside of all categorisation. ... slipstream induces a sense of 'otherness' in the audience, like a glimpse into a distorting mirror.\"\n\nSlipstream falls between speculative fiction and mainstream fiction. While some slipstream novels employ elements of science fiction or fantasy, not all do. The common unifying factor of these pieces of literature is some degree of the surreal, the not-entirely-real, or the markedly anti-real. According to Kelly and Kessel, however, there are three basic characteristics of a slipstream narrative: it disrupts the principle of realism; it is not a traditional fantasy story; and, it is a postmodern narrative. As an emerging genre, slipstream has been described as nonrealistic fiction with a postmodern sensibility.\n\nIn 2007, the first London Literature Festival at the Royal Festival Hall held a Slipstream night chaired by Toby Litt and featuring the British authors Steven Hall and Scarlett Thomas.\n\nIn her 2012 volume \"Walking the Clouds: An Anthology of Indigenous Science Fiction\", Grace Dillon identifies a current of Native American Slipstream that predates and anticipates slipstream, with examples including Gerald Vizenor's \"Custer on the Slipstream\" (1978).\n\n\n"}

Its name was derived from Azania, the ancient Greek name for Southern Africa.\n\nAzania is the name that has been applied to various parts of southeastern tropical Africa. In the Roman period and perhaps earlier, the toponym referred to a portion of the Southeast African coast extending from Kenya, to perhaps as far south as Tanzania.\n\nPoqo was founded in 1961 following the massacre of PAC-led protestors at the hands of police outside the Sharpeville police station the previous year. Potlako Leballo, the chairman of the PAC at the time of the formation of its military wing in the 1960s, modelled APLA on the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with Templeton Ntantala as his deputy.\n\nMembers of Poqo targeted the town of Paarl in the Western Cape on 22 November 1962, when a crowd of over 200 people armed with axes, pangas and other home-made weapons marched from the Mbekweni township into Paarl and attacked the police station, homes and shops. Two white residents, Frans Richard and Rencia Vermeulen were killed. This attack was followed by the murder of a family camping at Bashee River in the Transkei on 4 February 1963. Norman and Elizabeth Grobbelaar, their teenage daughters Edna and Dawn, together with Mr Derek Thompson, were hacked to death in their caravans.\n\nAfter the Soweto uprising in 1976, a number of students went into exile in APLA camps elsewhere on the African continent. In 1976, APLA received 500 recruits, including 178 Basotho, for a new Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), to be formed as an offshoot of the exiled-Basutoland Congress Party under the leadership of Matooane Mapefane, who was a senior instructor of APLA in Libya. Ntantala's original group of 70 APLA soldiers felt threatened by the influx of new recruits, leading Ntantala to attempt a coup against then commander, Potlako Leballo in Dar es Salaam. This was prevented by LLA soldiers, a move which exacerbated tensions within two PAC factions, the \"Diplomat-Reformist\" (DR) and \"Maoist-Revolutionary\" (MR) factions. Vusumzi Make's appointment as Leballo's successor sparked a mutiny at Chunya, an APLA camp in Tanzania, on 11 March 1980, during which several APLA forces were killed and the rest further factionalised and confined to different camps; many escaped to Kenya. Leballo himself relocated to Zimbabwe in late 1980 along with senior intelligence and air force personnel from the MR faction. Pressure from Tanzania, however, resulted in his deportation in May–June 1981, as well as the deportation or imprisonment of the others. Make was replaced by John Nyathi Pokela (who was released from Robben Island in 1980), but his ineffectual term of office was marred by further mutinies, executions and assassinations. Following Pokela’s death, Leballo made a comeback through support from Libya, North Korea and Ghana. After his sudden death in January 1986, the DR faction, outmaneuvered by the ANC, fell into disarray leaving behind the legacy of a semi-national socialist political front.\n\nAfter 1986, APLA rejected the MR faction's concept of the guerrilla as a social reformer and instead adopted an ultimately disastrous rallying cry of \"One Settler, One Bullet\". In the 1990–94 period, the organisation became known for its attacks on civilians despite the progress in negotiations at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. In 1993, the APLA’s chief commander, Sabelo Phama, declared that he \"would aim his guns at children - to hurt whites where it hurts most.\" Phama proclaimed 1993 as \"The Year of the Great Storm\" and sanctioned the following attacks on civilians:\n\n\nIn total thirty-two applications were received for attacks on civilians. In these incidents, 24 people were killed and 122 seriously injured.\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission has presently charged that PAC-sanctioned action directed towards white South Africans were \"gross violations of human rights for which the PAC and APLA leadership are held to be morally and politically responsible and accountable\".\n\nIn spite of their failure to achieve their goals at the negotiated settlements to end apartheid, the PAC decided to participate in the 1994 elections, and PAC leader Clarence Makwetu ordered APLA to end its armed struggle.\n\nIn 1994, APLA was disbanded and absorbed into the new South African National Defence Force, although members of the MR-faction refused to accept this agreement. Attempts by MR officers to regroup in Vietnam, North Korea, and China were unsuccessful, although links were maintained with the Tamil Tigers and Maoist groups in Nepal and India. Occasional propaganda leaflets distributed within South Africa focus on disparity of wealth and the issue of land.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972613", "title": "Siege of Corinth", "text": "Siege of Corinth\n\nThe siege of Corinth (also known as the first Battle of Corinth) was an American Civil War engagement lasting from April 29 to May 30, 1862, in Corinth, Mississippi. A collection of Union forces under the overall command of Major General Henry Halleck engaged in a month-long siege of the city, whose Confederate occupants were commanded by General P.G.T. Beauregard. The siege resulted in the capture of the town by Federal forces.\n\nThe town was a strategic point at the junction of two vital railroad lines, the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. Former Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Pope Walker called this intersection \"the vertebrae of the Confederacy\". General Halleck argued: \"Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategic points of the war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards\". Another reason for the town's importance was that, if captured by Union forces, it would threaten the security of Chattanooga and render Southern control of the track west of that East Tennessee bastion meaningless.\n\nThe siege ended when the outnumbered Confederates withdrew on May 29. This effectively cut off the prospect of further Confederate attempts to regain western Tennessee. The Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant took control and made it the base for Grant's operations to seize control of the Mississippi River Valley, and especially the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Grant later within his memoirs would recall the importance Corinth held in the cause to a Union victory in the region: \"Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold, and consequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of\". General C. S. Hamilton would later recount that the importance of Corinth was summed up as such: \"The Confederate armies had been driven from the Ohio River, almost out of the States of Tennessee and Kentucky a steadying back for a distance of 200 miles Federal occupation reaching the Gulf States where chivalrous foes had been sure Yankee would never set foot\". Sherman too would later write of the importance that Corinth held after the Second Battle of Corinth was concluded: \"In Memphis I could see its effects upon the citizens, and they openly admitted that their cause had sustained a death-blow\".\n\nWith the siege of Corinth completed, Federal troops had the opportunity to strike towards Vicksburg or Chattanooga, but it would be after the Second Battle of Corinth that October that Grant could strike for Vicksburg. The Siege of Corinth was described by General Sherman as a change in the tactics in West Tennessee: \"The effect of the battle of Corinth was very great. It was, indeed, a decisive blow to the Confederate cause in our quarter, and changed the whole aspect of affairs in West Tennessee. From the timid defensive we were at once enabled to assume the bold offensive\".\n\nFollowing the Union Army victory at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6–7, Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck amassed three Union armies —the Army of the Tennessee, the Army of the Ohio, and the Army of the Mississippi— for an advance on the vital rail center of Corinth, Mississippi. Made cautious by the staggering losses at Shiloh, Halleck embarked on a tedious campaign of offensive entrenchment, fortifying after each advance. By May 25, 1862, after moving five miles in three weeks, Halleck was in position to lay siege to the town. Confederate morale was low and Beauregard was outnumbered two to one. The water was bad. Typhoid and dysentery had felled thousands of his men. At a council of war, the Confederate officers concluded that they could not hold the railroad crossover. Sickness had claimed the lives of almost as many men as the Confederacy had lost at Shiloh.\n\nThe Department of the Mississippi, commanded by Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck, was divided into three wings. Each wing corresponded to one of the three armies under his command. It totaled 120,172 men “present for duty”.\n\n\nThe Army of Mississippi, commanded by General P. G. T. Beauregard, who also held overall command of all Confederate forces at Corinth, consisted of 45,440 men on April 30. It was divided into four corps:\n\n\nThe Army of the West, commanded by Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, consisted of 12,901 men under the divisions of Maj. Gen. Samuel Jones, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, and Maj. Gen. John P. McCown.\n\nOf Halleck's wing commanders John Pope proved to be the most aggressive during the campaign. Pope led the army's Left Wing and was furthest away from Halleck's headquarters. On May 3 Pope moved forward and captured the town of Farmington only a few miles from Corinth. Instead of moving the Center Wing under Don Carlos Buell forward, Halleck ordered Pope to withdraw and realign with Buell. General Pierre G. T. Beauregard ordered Earl Van Dorn to attack Pope's advanced wing on May 9. Pope made a successful withdrawal and rejoined with Buell. General Braxton Bragg of the Confederate States Army (CSA) had 25,000 men. The Union Army had 12,000 troops on hand. Van Dorn's corps, barely engaged, had 9 casualties. Daniel Ruggles's division on the other hand, which bore the brunt of the fighting, suffered casualties of 8 dead, 89 wounded and two missing or captured. The Union Army had 16 killed, 148 wounded and 14 missing or captured.\nThe 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment was ordered to draw the enemy out as to count their numbers and they withdrew to a swamp north of town. Wisconsin 8th reported 5 killed, 14 severely wounded, and 19 slightly wounded. Old Abe the Screaming Eagle accompanied the Wisconsin 8th Infantry.\n\nAs the wings of Halleck's army group began to align themselves in front of Corinth, Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman proposed a plan of attack against the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers, which had created a strong defensive position at the Russell house along the Confederate front lines. Sherman met with generals Halleck and George Henry Thomas on May 16 to discuss his plan. Sherman planned for the brigades of Colonel Morgan L. Smith and Brig. Gen. James W. Denver to lead the attack with Maj. Gen. Stephen A. Hurlbut's division lending support. On May 17 the attack commenced with Denver on the right, Smith in the center and Hurlbut's reserve to the right. Chalmers offered a stubborn resistance while some of his men fired from within the Russell house. The Confederates almost succeeded with a flank attack against Smith's right but were repulsed by Colonel Thomas Kilby Smith and the 54th Ohio Infantry. As soon as a battery from the 1st Illinois Artillery deployed the advantage was in favor of the Union forces. Chalmers retreated beyond Philips Creek near the Russell house property and Morgan Smith's brigade occupied high ground on which the house stood. Sherman's losses were 10 killed and 31 wounded all of which were from Smith's brigade. Confederate losses were unknown but Sherman reported 12 dead left on the field. That same day a division under Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Sherman drove off a Confederate force covering a crossing along Bridge Creek.\n\nOn May 21 Maj. Gen. William \"Bull\" Nelson ordered Colonel Thomas D. Sedgwick to conduct a reconnaissance-in-force against the Confederate trenches along Bridge Creek near Widow Surratt's farm Sedgwick moved forward from the Union trenches occupied by Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood's division and deployed the 20th Kentucky infantry at the edge of a clearing and the 1st Kentucky infantry to the left facing a densely wooded area. Shortly after deployment the Kentuckians came under fire. The Confederate resistance was so severe Sedgwick was forced to fall back. Sedgwick brought forward artillery and the 2nd Kentucky infantry while General Wood lent cavalry support from his division. The Confederates attempted a flank attack against the 1st Kentucky but the Union artillery (personally supervised by Captain Alvan C. Gillem of Buell's staff) and the 31st Indiana infantry in reserve stabilized the line. The Confederates made three more attempts to turn the Union flank until retiring to a creek beyond the Surratt farm. General Nelson ordered Sedgwick to hold his position until nightfall, then return to the Union camp. A week later General Buell would mount an attack to gain the high ground surrounding the Surratt farm.\n\nOn May 27 Halleck ordered Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman to drive the Confederates from a log house along the Corinth Road and make a strong demonstration against Corinth itself if possible. At the edge of a cotton field along Sherman's front was a double log house which the Confederates had converted into a block house by removing the chinking between the logs. Sherman formed an attacking column with Morgan L. Smith's brigade on the left and James W. Denver's brigade on the right. John A. Logan's brigade (from John A. McClernand's reserve corps) and James C. Veatch's brigade (from Stephen A. Hurlbut's division) were also brought up for support. Colonel Ezra Taylor fired several artillery rounds to signal the infantry attack. Denver and Smith quickly overtook the log house by storm and secured the hilltop position. The Confederates rallied and drove in Sherman's skirmishers but the counterattack was repulsed by the main line of infantry with artillery support. The following day the rest of Sherman's division and artillery moved forward to the new position which offered a good vantage point into Corinth itself. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and George H. Thomas were both present on the field during this engagement, giving approval for the behavior of operation.\n\nConfederate infantry had been using a hill in the vicinity of the Widow Surratt farm for picket outposts. With all his wings in line Halleck ordered Buell to clear the Confederates off the Surratt farm hill. Buell chose Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook's reserve division to seize the hill to be used as a staging point for a further attack against Corinth. On May 27 McCook organized his brigades into line of attack intending to overwhelm the Confederates by surprise and overwhelming force. The brigades of Brig. Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau and Brig. Gen. Richard W. Johnson would lead the advance, side by side. Colonel Frederick S. Stumbaugh's brigade followed in support of Johnson and Colonel Robert L. McCook's brigade (from Thomas W. Sherman's division) in support of Rousseau. Johnson's brigade encountered some heavy skirmishing but the hill was taken in short time. McCook's division entrenched and brought heavy artillery to the new position and immediately began to shell the Confederates. Beauregard's artillery responded with minimal effort. The engagement at the Surratt farm hill allowed Halleck to bring forward siege guns for the bombardment of Corinth.\n\nOn May 28 Maj. Gen. Nelson ordered Colonel Sedgwick to seize a Confederate-held crossing of Bridge Creek, a small tributary of the Tuscumbia River. Sedgwick moved his brigade out from the main Union trenches with the 2nd and 20th Kentucky infantry regiments in the lead. Sedgwick drove in the Confederate pickets then encountered a larger force guarding the bridge. The Kentucky infantry managed to gain hold of the eastern end of the bridge while Sedgwick ordered forward the 31st Indiana infantry and Captain John Mendenhall's artillery battery. These reinforcements and artillery forced the Confederates to abandon the bridge completely.\n\nWith the Federal army preparing to lay siege to the town, a Confederate council of war decided to retreat. Confederate commander General P. G. T. Beauregard saved his army by a hoax. Some of the men were given three days' rations and ordered to prepare for an attack. As expected, one or two went over to the Union with that news. The preliminary bombardment began, and Union forces maneuvered for position. During the night of May 29, the Confederate army moved out. They used the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to carry the sick and wounded, the heavy artillery, and tons of supplies. When a train arrived, the troops cheered as though reinforcements were arriving. They set up dummy Quaker Guns along the defensive earthworks. Camp fires were kept burning, and buglers and drummers played. The rest of the men slipped away undetected, withdrawing to Tupelo, Mississippi. When Union patrols entered Corinth on the morning of May 30, they found the Confederate troops gone. The Union forces took control and made it the base for their operations to seize control of the Mississippi River Valley, and especially the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n\nJohn Pope, whose aggressiveness exceeded his strategic capabilities, remarked in his memoirs that Halleck's cautious campaign failed to take full advantage of a glittering array of talented Union officers, including \"Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Thomas, McPherson, Logan, Buell, Rosecrans and many others I might mention.\"\n\nA Confederate army led by Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn attempted to retake the city in October 1862, but was defeated in the Second Battle of Corinth by a Union army under the command of Rosecrans. At times during the second battle, Confederate forces seemed to have the upper hand but would fail to follow up their successes leading to a devastating defeat for Confederate forces in that region. Rosecrans had the opportunity to crush rebel forces during the battle but failed to follow up his victory, allowing Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to escape from destruction. Corinth would ultimately lead to the operations that would open the Mississippi River valley which was considered by General Chief Henry W. Halleck as, \"the opening of the Mississippi River will be to us of more advantage than the capture of forty Richmonds\". Confederate Brigadier General Joseph L. Hogg, father of the famous future Texas governor Jim Hogg, contracted dysentery during the siege and died on May 16, 1862.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972625", "title": "John Stewart (comics)", "text": "John Stewart (comics)\n\nJohn Stewart, one of the characters known as Green Lantern, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics and was the first African-American superhero to appear in DC Comics. The character was created by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, and first appeared in \"Green Lantern (Volume 2)\" #87 (December 1971/January 1972). Stewart's original design was based on actor Sidney Poitier.\n\nJohn Stewart debuted in \"Green Lantern 2011\" vol. 2 #87 (December 1971/January 1972) when artist Neal Adams came up with the idea of a substitute Green Lantern. The decision to make the character black resulted from a conversation between Adams and editor Julius Schwartz, in which Adams recounts saying that given the racial makeup of the world's population, \"we ought to have a black Green Lantern, not because we’re liberals, but because it just makes sense.\" The character was DC's first black superhero.\n\nJohn Stewart has become a major recurring character in the Green Lantern mythos within the DC Universe. He became the primary character of \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2 from issues #182 through #200, when Hal Jordan relinquished his place in the Green Lantern Corps (1984–1986). He continued to star in the book when the title changed to \"The Green Lantern Corps\" from issue #201 to #224 (1986–1988). He would continue to make key appearances in \"Action Comics Weekly\" after \"The Green Lantern Corps\"' cancellation (1988). He starred in the comic \"\", which DC spun out of \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, with a four-part storyline titled \"Mosaic\" (issues #14–17). DC published 18 issues of the ongoing \"Green Lantern: Mosaic\" title between June 1992 and November 1993.\n\nJohn Stewart was featured as one of the lead characters on the television cartoon \"Justice League\" from 2001 until 2004. He continued to appear as a major character on the show's 2004–2006 sequel, \"Justice League Unlimited\". In 2011, John Stewart starred in the New 52 relaunch of \"Green Lantern Corps\" alongside Guy Gardner, and became the sole lead character of the title from 2013 until the series' conclusion in 2015. \"Green Lantern Corps\" was replaced by \"Green Lantern: The Lost Army\", which also stars John Stewart as the lead.\n\nJohn Stewart is an architect, later \"retconned\" into a veteran U.S. Marine from Detroit, Michigan, who was selected by the Guardians as a backup Green Lantern to then-current Green Lantern Hal Jordan, after the previous backup, Guy Gardner, was seriously injured after getting hit by a car while trying to save a civilian. Although Jordan objected to the decision after seeing that Stewart had a belligerent attitude to authority figures, the Guardians stood by their decision, and chided Jordan for his supposed bigoted outlook on the issue. Jordan explained that he just felt that even though Stewart might have the integrity for the task, he \"obviously would have a chip on his shoulder bigger than the rock of Gibraltar.\"\n\nJordan's opinion was that Stewart's first mission began badly. His assignment was to protect a racist politician, and Stewart, while averting an accident, took advantage of the situation to embarrass Jordan in the process. When an assassin shoots at the politician, Stewart does not intervene with Jordan in response to the attack, which initially makes Stewart seem suspect. However, it turns out Stewart had good reasons for this apparent dereliction of duty because he was stopping a gunman from killing a police officer in the outside parking lot at the event while Jordan was pursuing a decoy. When Jordan confronts Stewart about his actions, Stewart explains that the politician had staged the attack for political advantage. Jordan then concludes that Stewart was an excellent recruit and has proven his worth.\n\nFor some time, Stewart occasionally filled in as Green Lantern when Jordan was unavailable, including some missions of the Justice League.\n\nAfter Jordan gave up being Green Lantern in the 1980s, the Guardians selected Stewart for full-time duty. Stewart filled that role for some years. During that period he worked as an architect at Ferris Aircraft Company, battled many Green Lantern villains, and fought against the Anti-Monitor's forces during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. John was trained in usage of his power ring by Katma Tui, the Green Lantern of the planet Korugar. The duo went on many adventures together and eventually fell in love. Kat and John went on to serve within the Green Lantern Corps of Earth alongside Hal Jordan, Arisia, Kilowog, Salaak, and other alien Green Lanterns, during which time they were married.\n\nAfter John's ring was rendered powerless through the schemes of Sinestro, and Katma Tui was murdered at the hands of the insane Star Sapphire, Stewart's life began to unravel. First, he was falsely accused of killing Carol Ferris, Star Sapphire's alter ego, and then falsely accused of theft by South Nambia (a fictional nation within the DC universe similar to apartheid-era South Africa). Jailed and tortured in South Nambia for weeks, John freed himself with his old ring, now re-powered thanks to the efforts of Hal Jordan. In his escape, John inadvertently frees both a serial killer and a terrorist. When Jordan confronts John over his actions, the two friends come to blows until John realizes the \"revolutionaries\" he had been aiding intended to murder innocent civilians.\n\nAfterwards, John left Earth for space, where he participated in the Cosmic Odyssey miniseries event, and failed to prevent the destruction of the planet Xanshi by an avatar of the Anti-Life Equation. The incident earned him the ire of J’onn J’onzz the Martian Manhunter, who was with him at the time. This series of tragedies left John a shattered man on the brink of suicide and created the villainess known as Fatality. J'onn J'onzz has since, at least civilly, forgiven him.\n\nJohn finally forgave himself for his past mistakes and grew into a stronger, more complex hero when he became the caretaker of the \"Mosaic World\", a patchwork of communities from multiple planets that had been brought to Oa by an insane Guardian who had invaded John's mind. Although bitter and sullen at his assignment at first, he overcame this and, using his formidable intellect and talent for unconventional thinking, Stewart forged the Mosaic into a new society and eventually became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe, known as the Master Builder. As his reward for this new level of awareness, John was reunited with his late wife, Katma Tui. However, tragedy struck once again and Hal Jordan, possessed by Parallax, destroyed both the Guardians and the Central Power Battery, robbing John of his newfound powers and his resurrected wife.\n\nFollowing \"Emerald Twilight\" and the collapse of the Green Lantern Corps, Stewart was recruited by the Controllers to command the Darkstars, another interstellar peacekeeping force. Using the new resources at his command, Stewart evacuated the Mosaic cities from Oa prior to its destruction and served the Darkstars with distinction until he was crippled in battle with Grayven on the planet Rann. Stewart eventually regained the use of his legs as a parting gift from Jordan before Jordan sacrificed himself to destroy the Sun-Eater during the 1996 \"The Final Night\" storyline. As a result of Jordan healing him, he began to exhibit random bursts of energy from his hands that he was able to discharge on three different occasions. Though he had initially refused a new Green Lantern ring months prior, he eventually accepted a new one entrusted to Kyle Rayner by a time-lost Hal Jordan, and joined the Justice League to fill in for Rayner as he took an extended leave of absence from Earth.\n\nWith the return of Hal Jordan and the Guardians, the Corps has been reorganized. Each sector of space now has two Green Lanterns assigned to it, and Stewart and Jordan now share regular duty for Earth's sector, 2814. After the dissolution of the Justice League in the aftermath of the events depicted in the 2004 miniseries \"Identity Crisis\", and the destruction of their Watchtower headquarters on the moon, Stewart has begun playing a larger role in metahuman affairs, working with many former Justice Leaguers.\n\nDuring the \"52\" storyline, John Stewart alongside Hal Jordan are involved in one of the first post-Freedom of Power Treaty confrontations. After a battle with the Great Ten and Black Adam, John and Hal are escorted to Russian airspace by the Rocket Red Brigade.\n\nDuring the opening \"One Year Later\" storyline of \"Green Lantern\", Hal Jordan tells Green Arrow that John Stewart is on an off-world undercover mission. The details John Stewart disguised himself as the bounty hunter \"Hunger Dog\" to undercover in Europe. When John hears that Hal Jordan is being held captive by Amon Sur and Loragg, he goes off to rescue him. This led to a confrontation with Amon Sur, who turns out to be the son of their predecessor, Abin Sur. During the fight, Amon receives a ring from the Sinestro Corps and vanishes.\n\nIn \"Justice League of America\" vol. 2, #7, he and Wonder Woman designed one of the League's new headquarters, \"The Hall\". John later resumes his role as the League's resident Green Lantern upon Hal Jordan's request.\n\nIn the \"Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special\", the Green Lantern Corps are attacked by Bedovian, the sniper of the Sinestro Corps, who is capable of taking out a target from three sectors away, all from the inside of a red Sun-Eater. After Bedovian takes out several Green Lanterns, John Stewart uses his power ring as a scoped sniper rifle to track the nearby sectors. He eventually discovers Bedovian's hiding spot and shoots him. As Green Lantern Corps member were forbidden from killing sentient beings at that time, Bedovian survived the attack, as recently seen in the Blackest Night crossover. John and Guy Gardner are captured by Lyssa Drak and taken back to Qward, where the two Lanterns are held captive. Hal manages to defeat Lyssa and free John and Guy from their nightmares, while the Lost Lanterns recover Ion. The earth-based Lanterns then return home, only to find that New Earth, as the center of the Multiverse, is the Sinestro Corps' next target.\n\nThe Sinestro Corps and the Manhunters invade Earth. The Cyborg Superman and Superboy-Prime attack Superman, while Hal confronts Parallax, who has possessed Kyle Rayner, just before the latter is about to kill Hal's family. John orders Guy to retrieve a painting by Kyle Rayner's mother. When Parallax absorbs Hal inside himself, John looks on with sudden shock. Guy returns and shoves the painting into Parallax's eyesight, allowing Hal to use it to help Kyle overcome his fears and expel Parallax. Now in its original form, Parallax is then contained by Ganthet and Sayd within the Power Batteries of Hal, John, Guy, and Kyle. Ganthet and Sayd then reveal that they are no longer Guardians. Ganthet gives Kyle a new power ring and asks Kyle to become a Green Lantern again, to which he agrees. The four then race off to finish the fight. At Guy Gardner's suggestion, John and the other Lanterns use Warworld as a gigantic grenade, badly wounding the Anti-Monitor, who is then thrown into space by Superboy-Prime.\n\nJohn Stewart witnessed Guy being infected by the Sinestro Corps member who is a living virus, named Despotellis, and asked Soranik Natu to help Guy. Soranik used the Green Lantern Corps smallpox virus named Leezle Pon, who stops Despotellis. John Stewart was later approached by the Guardians to become one of the Alpha Lanterns, a new division of the Corps devoted to the internal affairs of the Corps. Stewart, desiring more information about the secrecy of the forbidden prophecies, declined the offer, to the extreme disappointment of the Guardians.\n\nIt has also been revealed that John served in the Marine Corps as a sniper prior to becoming an architect. While the idea of John being a former Marine was taken from the \"Justice League\" cartoon, the sniper angle is a new addition to the character's background. During his time in the Marines, John met the then young Hal Jordan when he was in the Air Force before they both join the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nDuring the \"Rage of the Red Lanterns\" story arc, John Stewart is one of the guards assigned to escort Sinestro to Korugar to face execution. However, the Green Lanterns are ambushed by the Sinestro Corps and then the Red Lantern Corps under Atrocitus. The Green Lanterns are left to die in space after Atrocitus captures Sinestro, but they are saved by Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps. John, however, is infected with the Red Lanterns' rage. Saint Walker conjures up a blue energy construct of Katma Tui, who heals John and calms him by showing him a vision of flying with Katma. John later tells Kilowog that he is going to see Katma again, saying that \"the universe said so\". In that same issue, Fatality is converted into a Star Sapphire, and orders her ring to locate John Stewart. When she tracks down John, she tells him she forgives him, and kisses him. Before departing, she encourages John to forgive himself for what happened to Xanshi.\n\nStewart appears in the \"Trinity\" series. He is the one to first attack the alien creature Konvikt, but when he's on the verge of defeating him, his concentration suddenly snaps, and starts muttering incoherently in binary code. A moment later, he spontaneously generates complex weapons from his body, by means unrelated to his ring. Later, he attempts to overexert himself to know how he generated those weapons by running a brutal training session against holographic Qwardian Thunderers, which does not work. He later shows Firestorm the machinery used to monitor the Cosmic Egg imprisoning Krona, but as he leaves again, he suffers from a relapse and start generating knives from his uniform, and it is revealed the entire system is broken.\n\nLater, on board the Antimatter Earth Crime Syndicate satellite, he again loses control and nearly brings down the satellite with his blasts. It is revealed these discharges are brought about due to John's absorption of a Qwardian superweapon, the Void Hound, which has been trying to escape its containment, or at least seize control of Stewart. After the sweeping, devastating effects of the spell engineered by Morgaine le Fey and Enigma, he is seen in an Earth under the control of a totalitarian Justice Society, where all Green Lanterns are forbidden to be. He eventually starts breaking down, and with the Void Hound gaining enough hold on him to force him to create a black hole which forces him back to Earth, he has no choice but to comply. The Void Hound is later revealed to be a servant of Krona, and its hold over John is broken when Krona is defeated.\n\nAfter a massive battle between the JLA and the Shadow Cabinet, John chooses to stay with the League despite many of its members choosing to leave. After Kimiyo Hoshi goes missing while tracking down Shadow Thief, John blackmails the armored vigilante Hardware into helping the team track her down. The League arrives in the Himalayas, discovering Kimiyo and Superman's friend Icon engaged in a fierce battle with the cosmic vampire known as Starbreaker. The JLA defeats Starbreaker, and John takes a leave of absence to go to Xanshi.\n\nWhen John visits the grave of planet Xanshi, thousands of black rings fly into the planetary debris, and reconstitute the entire planet. Xanshi itself then speaks to John, telling him \"I can help you save them.\" Against his better judgment, John descends to the planet's surface. Once reaching the surface, John finds himself confronted by Katma Tui and the entire population of Xanshi as Black Lanterns. While battling them all, Katma tries to weaken John by claiming that he caused the planet's destruction. However, John, spurred on by Fatality's words, says that he wasn't the cause of it all and successfully fights off the Black Lanterns. After escaping Xanshi's atmosphere, John realises that the planet is headed for Earth, along with every Black Lantern in the universe, and contacts Hal, warning him of the impending threat. Later, John is saved by combined efforts of the various Lanterns corps, who had just arrived to battle the Black Lanterns.\n\nIn the events of Brightest Day, John is seen on Oa, supervising the demolition of the buildings left in ruins after the Black Lanterns attack, and planning the reconstruction. Suddenly, he is called to the Guardians' chamber, where they order him to join Alpha Lantern Boodikka in a mission to robot planet Grenda, Stel's homeworld, where the communications ceased abruptly without explanation, and Lantern Stel and the population are missing. John agrees and departs with Boodikka.\n\nAfter arriving on the planet, the two confirmed the Guardians report: the entire population has mysteriously disappeared. John asks Boodikka if something of her older self remains despite being turned into an Alpha Lantern, after she asks him why he refused to join the Alpha Lanterns. Boodikka responds that her changes are only physical, and she still has her former personality; John doubts this affirmation. The two discover what seems to be a Green Lantern House Sector, that, according to Boodikka, is not registered. After entering inside, they discovered Green Lanterns Horoq Nnot and Stel; the last one tells John he must flee from the planet immediately. Suddenly, Boodikka turns against John and attacks him; John fights back, but he's surrounded by more rogue Alpha Lanterns and is defeated. It's revealed that the Alpha Lanterns have begun a revolt against the rest of the Corps, and have allied themselves with the Cyborg Superman (now with an Alpha Lantern battery), taking control of Grenda to use the planet as their hidden base to turn Green Lanterns into Alpha Lanterns. John Stewart is last seen wounded and bleeding, being taken to Henshaw by Boodikka. Cyborg Superman then begins the cosmetic surgery to turn John into another Alpha Lantern.\n\nBefore starting the operation, however, Henshaw connects Stewart's brain to his memories in order to see why he was turned into a cyborg. He also reveals to John, that, after being resurrected by the Manhunters after the Sinestro Corps War, he returned to Earth in the middle of the \"Blackest Night\", and pleaded to the Black Lanterns (among them are the former crew of his space shuttle) and Nekron to kill him, only to discover that because he did not have a physical heart, he was invisible to them. Angered for being ignored by death itself, the Cyborg Superman encountered the mysterious hooded stranger who abducted the entities of the Emotional Spectrum. He convinced him that Ganthet has the power and knowledge to turn Alpha Lanterns into normal beings again. John realizes that Henshaw organized the revolt of the Alpha Lanterns with the sole purpose to attract Ganthet to the planet Grenda and forced him to turn Henshaw into a mortal being again. Kyle and Soranik burst into the lab and manage to rescue John, but Ganthet is captured. They hide in a cave, where John informs them about the Cyborg Superman's true plan. They also discover the missing robot inhabitants of the planet, trapped in the depths of the cave by Henshaw. Mounting a defense, they battle against Henshaw and his forces, destroying the cyborg's body. Henshaw leaps into Boodikka's body, but her consciousness manages to defeat his, seemingly destroying him. John later joins Kyle Rayner and Ganthet in a mission to the anti-matter universe, in order to save Soranik Natu.\n\nOn their return to the matter universe, John and the others are affected by the return of Parallax to the Central Power Battery by Krona. Their previous experience with Parallax allows John, Kyle and Ganthet to escape its control, but they are forced to fight their fellow Green Lanterns. Affected by Parallax's fear powers, John and Kyle are forced to remove their rings and escape through Oa's underground. They then meet up with Guy and Hal, who has the rings of the other corps' leaders. John initially chooses Larfleeze's orange ring, but is convinced by Hal to use Indigo-1's ring instead due to the debilitating effects of the orange ring on the wearer's psyche. When the corrupted Green Lanterns attack, John has difficulty channeling the various corps powers through his ring. Things are made worse when Mogo joins the attack. While Hal and Guy go to remove Parallax from the Central Power Battery, John and Kyle attempt to free Mogo from Krona's control. On the way, John attempts to stop the flow of tainted rings sent by Mogo, but fails. As he and Kyle head for Mogo's core instead, they discover residual Black Lantern energy around it. John absorbs the Black Lantern energy, along with all the Green Lantern energy, and regretfully uses it to destroy Mogo, knowing that they lack the time to heal Mogo before Krona uses it to 'recruit' a wave of reinforcement Green Lanterns. In the fallout, the two regroup with Hal, Guy and Ganthet, using the full power of the emotional spectrum to crack open the Battery and release Parallax. Their job done, the Lanterns regain their original green rings, in preparation for the final confrontation with Krona.\n\nFollowing the War's conclusion, John assists a new Green Lantern from Sector 282 'selected' during the period when Mogo was under Krona's control in adjusting to the power of her ring despite the possibility that she will not be allowed to keep it by assisting her in halting a war taking place in her sector, the original Lantern for that sector having died during the war. When John is able to help the two sides find a peaceful resolution to their conflict, his new student reflects that, despite John's reputation after destroying two worlds, she now knows that nobody could regret that action more than John himself.\n\nAfter Hal's expulsion and Kyle's departure, John joins Guy Gardner and others in investigating recent attacks in a distant sector of space, which are revealed to be the result of an old Guardian experiment. At one point, John is forced to kill Kirrt Kallak, another Lantern who was about to give in to torture and reveal the access codes to the Oan defence network. John is approached by the Alpha Lantern to arrest him for that murder. He is found guilty for this crime and sentenced to death. However Guy Gardner and other fellow Lanterns free him before the execution, resulting in the destruction of the Alpha Lanterns when the Green Lanterns refuse to allow John to be executed. During the fights, the Alpha Lanterns (revealing to the reader that the Guardians set up these events as part of their plans to destroy the Corps) realize that all the Alpha Lanterns had become dangerously mentally unstable. Alpha Lantern Varix caused a reaction which killed all the Alpha Lanterns, including himself.\n\nDuring the \"Rise of the Third Army\" storyline, the Guardians contact John and state that Mogo's remains appear to be moving, The Guardians have come to the conclusion that Mogo is trying to reform and assign John to track it. While tracking the Mogo fragment's destination, he is discovered by Fatality, who is seeking a sundered love in danger. After they find Mogo's pieces – realizing that the endangered love is the male and female elements of Mogo's personality trying to come back together- John figures out that the Guardians want to use Mogo. After the villainous First Lantern is destroyed and the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, John begins a relationship with Fatality in-between on Mogo.\n\nAfter the invasion of Durlans, John discovered that a Durlan impersonated Fatality delectably throughout the months. John defeats the imposter and vows to search for the real Fatality. When John locates and reunites with her on the Durlan prison planet, Fatality attacks him. She revealed to him that the Zamarons had influenced her into becoming a Star Sapphire, forcing her to love him when she actually hated him. After John refuses to fight, Fatality leaves, telling John that he and the Star Sapphires are her enemies leaving John in sorrow.\n\nFollowing the \"DC Rebirth\" Event, John has become leader of the mixed Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps.\n\nAs a Green Lantern, John Stewart is semi-invulnerable, capable of projecting hard-light constructions, flight, and utilizing various other abilities through his power ring which are only limited by his imagination and willpower. John's unique combination of military and architecture expertise makes him one of the Corps most exceptional members.\n\nUnlike other Green Lanterns, John doesn't wear a physical Green Lantern ring. Following an attack by The Legion of Doom, and a confrontation with Sinestro, John has a Green Lantern symbol branded on his finger which allows his body to act as his power ring, with his heart functioning as his power battery. John's physical power ring was destroyed when Sinestro infused him with the Ultraviolet Light of the Invisible Spectrum down to the cellular level. John was able to overcome Umbrax's influence and turned his UV Lantern Corp tattoo ring into a Green Lantern tattoo ring. The full nature and extent of his capabilities are unknown.\n\n\nAs well as his obvious powers as a Lantern, John has also demonstrated a willingness to kill when he is certain the situation requires it, destroying Mogo in order to save the universe from the army of Krona-controlled Green Lanterns that Mogo would have created and later killing a fellow Lantern who was about to give in to torture and reveal vital information to their enemies.\n\nJohn Stewart is a member of the Green Lantern Marine Corps in \"\".\n\nJohn appeared as a reserve Green Lantern in \"Justice\". The Legion of Doom kidnapped all friends and relatives of the members of the League and mind-controlled the youngest generation of heroes to watch over them. John hadn't got a power ring at his disposal and was captured together with everyone else. \nEventually Green Arrow and Black Canary found the place where the Legion's hostages were locked and handed Hal's Power Ring to John. John quickly used the Ring to destroy the mindworms controlling Supergirl, Batgirl, Robin and other young heroes and wipe the knowledge of the League's identities from their enemies' minds. Afterwards he sent the Ring back to Hal when his friend was fighting Sinestro. \n\nJohn, known now as Power Ring, is shown to be a member of the anti-matter universe Crime Syndicate that attempts to kidnap Power Girl in \"\".\n\nIn the \"Flashpoint\" universe, John Stewart was a member of Team 7, an elite unit of soldiers led by Grifter. John and most of his teammates were ultimately killed during a botched attack on a terrorist training camp.\n\nThe later years of the animated version of John Stewart are detailed in a flashback story in \"Justice League Beyond\". It is revealed that sometime after the events of the series finale of \"JLU\", Vixen was murdered by a vengeful Shadow Thief on the night he planned to propose to her, forcing John to partner with Hawkgirl and Adam Strange in order to bring him to justice. John ultimately killed Shadow Thief via a gunshot wound to the skull, and was thus forced to resign from the Green Lantern Corps (with his ring later passing to a Chinese teenager named Kai-Ro decades later). After retiring from the Justice League, he ended up marrying Shayera and together they had a child, Warhawk.\n\nIn the distant future, the Book of Oa shows that John will one day become a United States Senator and marry Fatality.\n\nJohn appears in Year Two series where he is summoned to Oa to join other Green Lanterns. He discovers the Guardians are dispatching Lanterns to Earth to retrieve Superman, who has taken control of the world and enforced peace. When Hal Jordan renegades and tries to leave, John joins the others in subduing him. However, this is a front: he later helps Hal escape, believing Superman has only good intentions. He goes back to Earth with Hal and discovers him and his Regime facing the Lanterns, with Sinestro and his Corps aiding the Regime. Once the Green Lanterns are taken prisoner John joins the Regime in enforcing peace around the world. Once an entire armada of Green Lanterns come back seven months later, Guy Gardner tries to make peace before things get out of hand. Shocked when Superman coldly rebuffs him by breaking his arm, John tries to stop the war to the best of his ability, though he is stopped by Sinestro. Having realized the Regime is not as well intentioned as he thought, John is killed by Sinestro to make sure Hal at least remains steadfast, with Guy taking the fall for John's death and being killed in turn by Hal.\n\n\n\n\nIn the comic book continuation of the television series \"Smallville,\" Stewart is a member of the Green Lantern Corps who works as a police detective for the NYPD in his civilian identity. He helps train Clark Kent in the use of his power ring, and later teams up with the hero to defeat Parallax.\n\n\n\n\nIGN ranked John Stewart as the 55th greatest comic book hero of all time describing him as one of the first dominant African-American heroes in the pages of DC Comics; IGN also stated that John Stewart has gone from \"semi-obscurity in the mainstream to absolute recognition\" thanks to his starring role in the acclaimed Justice League cartoons.\n\n"}

Kilchoman was founded by Anthony Wills and remains an independent, family run distillery.

The distillery uses barley grown on site at Rockside Farm and malted at the distillery, as well as malt from the Port Ellen maltings and releases separate bottlings depending on the source of the grain.\n\nIt is one of only six Scottish distilleries still doing traditional floor-maltings, and is currently unique in completing all parts of the whisky making process – growing barley, malting, distilling, maturing and bottling – on Islay, making it the only true 'Barley to Bottle' experience in Scotland. \n\nThe distillery first filled casks on 14 December 2005 and the distillery began bottling 3-year-old single malt in September 2009. The first official Kilchoman, the \"Inaugural release\" was released in 2009 and the first 100% Islay whisky released in 2011.\n\nThe whisky produced by the Port Ellen maltings are peated to the same levels as Ardbeg 50 ppm, while the malt peated on their own floor maltings will be approximately 20 ppm.\n\nKilchoman releases several bottlings. The most important ones include:\n\n"}

It is the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile. The cathedral is named for Mary, mother of Jesus, under her title, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property to the Church Street East Historic District and Lower Dauphin Street Historic District and is listed on the Historic Roman Catholic Properties in Mobile Multiple Property Submission\n\nMobile’s Cathedral Parish was established on July 20, 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec. Bishop de Saint-Vallier named Father Roulleaux de La Vente, first pastor of the parish church, which was located at the French settlement of Mobile at the citadel of Fort Louis de la Louisiane. The parish is the first established on the Gulf Coast.\n\nWhen the Mobile settlement was relocated to its present site in 1711, a new parish church was built and was known as Notre Dame de la Mobile (Our Lady of Mobile). In 1781, during the Spanish occupation of Mobile, the parish took its current name, Immaculate Conception.\n\nMobile was elevated to a diocese in 1829, and Frenchman, Michael Portier, was named its first bishop. Bishop Portier’s first “cathedral” was a small wooden structure located in the Old Spanish Burying Ground, site of the present cathedral. Portier soon set out to construct a \"real\" cathedral.\n\nThe cathedral, designed in 1833, by Claude Beroujon, a former seminarian turned architect, is laid out in a Roman basilica design. Construction began in 1835, but the Panic of 1837, caused a shortage of funds and delayed progress. The cathedral was consecrated for public worship in 1850, by Bishop Portier, though Beroujon’s design was not yet fully realized. The portico and towers were to come later.\n\nThe classical portico, with eight massive columns of the Roman Doric order, was added in the 1870s, under the direction of Bishop John Quinlan. The two towers were completed in 1884, during the watch of Bishop Jeremiah O'Sullivan.\n\nLocated on South Claiborne Street in downtown, it is bounded by Dauphin Street on the north, Franklin Street on the west, and Conti Street on the south. The front of the church faces east, toward the Mobile River, and overlooks Cathedral Square.\n\nThe building, laid out in an east-west axis, is long and wide. The ceiling is at its highest point, and its twin towers rise to .\n\nOne of the cathedral’s finest attributes is its stained glass windows. The windows were made in Munich, Germany by Franz Mayer & Co., and installed beginning in 1890. The last window was installed in 1910, during the time of Bishop Edward Patrick Allen.\n\nThe twelve main windows, six on the south wall and six on the north wall, are approximately wide and tall. Each window depicts an event involving Mary in the life of her son, Jesus. The subjects of the south wall windows are \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\", the \"Presentation of Mary at the Temple\", the \"Annunciation\", the \"Visitation\", the \"Nativity of Jesus\", and the \"Holy Family\". The themes of the north wall are the \"Finding of the Child Jesus at the Temple\", the \"Marriage Feast of Cana\", the \"Crucifixion of Jesus\", \"Pentecost\", the \"Assumption of Mary into Heaven\", and the \"Coronation of Mary, Queen of Heaven\".\n\nTwo large windows flank the portico, one under each of the two towers. The \"Baptism of Jesus\" in the River Jordan, by John the Baptist is the subject of the window in the Reconciliation Room, under the north tower. The window under the south tower, in the stairway to the choir loft, appropriately depicts \"St. Cecilia\", patron saint of musicians.\n\nSmaller windows are found in each of the eight doors in the foyer, behind the cathedral’s main doors, at the church’s front entrance. These depict, from left to right, \"St. Augustine of Hippo\", \"Our Lady of Mount Carmel\", the \"Presentation of Mary at the Temple\", \"St. Louis IX, King of France\", \"St. Patrick\", \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\", \"St. Agnes of Rome, Virgin & Martyr \", and the \"Most Sacred Heart of Jesus\". Above the four middle doors is the Holy Spirit window.\n\nOver the course of time, the cathedral experienced its share of disasters, including an explosion, a fire, an airplane hit, and hurricanes.\n\nOn May 25, 1865, a Union Army ammunition depot exploded, killing some 300 persons, and burning much of Mobile. The windows and sashes on the north side of the cathedral were blown in by the explosion. Fortunately, there were no services being held in the cathedral at the time.\n\nDuring World War II, a pilot-in-training, flying low, clipped one of the towers, resulting in damage.\n\nDisaster struck on March 19, 1954, when a homeless man, seeking shelter in the church, caused a fire that destroyed the sanctuary. The church still stood, but the interior suffered damage from fire, smoke, and water from the firefighters’ attempt to control the blaze.\n\nAfter the 1954 fire, Bishop Thomas Joseph Toolen had the damaged stained glass windows sent to the Franz Meyer workshops in Munich for repair. Here the craftsmen used the original drawings as a guide in their restoration efforts. He replaced the fire-damaged cathedra and pulpit with new ones made of mahogany. A replacement organ, built by the Wicks Organ Company, was installed and is in use today. At this time, Toolen added a massive bronze baldachin above the altar, supported by four marble columns.\n\nIn the 1970s, Bishop John L. May made modifications to the sanctuary in compliance with the 1970 \"General Instruction of the Roman Missal.\" The altar was moved forward and the altar rails were removed. The cathedra was moved to its present location on the south end of the sanctuary facing the congregation. At this time, Bishop May also added a bronze representation of the Risen Christ above the baldachin and a large crucifix over the tabernacle.\n\nArchbishop Oscar Hugh Lipscomb led the most recent restoration effort in the 2000s. Under his direction, the cast iron fence was restored and repaired, and the cathedral exterior was cleaned and repaired. An interior overhaul, executed by Conrad Schmitt Studios, included a coffer ceiling above the main aisle. The coffers are decorated with alternating gold-leafed fleur-de-lis and shamrock, symbolically representing the Trinity, as well as the contributions of the French and Irish religious to the life of the Archdiocese. New lighting and a new color scheme brightens the interior. White marble flooring was installed in the aisles and the heart pine floors under the pews were refinished. Embedded in the marble floor of the main aisle are the coats-of-arms of the Mobile bishops and archbishops. A mural of the Tree of Jesse was installed above the pipe organ.\n\nIn 1962, Pope John XXIII elevated the cathedral to a minor basilica, a title bestowed, only by the pope, on churches of historical and spiritual importance. A basilica is entitled to have its own coat-of-arms. Other basilica insignia include Pope John XXIII's personal coat-of-arms installed above the cathedral entrance, the yellow and red \"umbracullum\" (umbrella) and \"tintinnabulum\" (bell) in the sanctuary.\n\nA gallery of photographs taken October 23, 1936, for the Historic American Buildings Survey.

It was first commercialized by the English company \"Pettit and Smith\" in 1856. The flame heats the air locally. This heated air then spreads by convection, thus heating the whole room. Today the same principle applies with outdoor patio heaters or \"mushroom heaters\" which act as giant Bunsen burners.\n\nBeginning in 1881 the burner's flame was used to heat a structure made of asbestos, a design patented by Sigismund Leoni, a British engineer. Later, fire clay replaced the asbestos because it is easier to mould. Modern gas heaters still work this way although using other refractory material. \n\nModern gas heaters have been further developed to include units which utilize radiant heat technology, rather than the principles of the Bunsen burner. This form of technology does not spread via convection, but rather, is absorbed by people and objects in its path. This form of heating is particularly useful for outdoor heating, where it is more economical than heating air that is free to move away.\n\nFlued heaters would always be permanently installed. The flue, if properly installed with correct overall height, should extract most heater emissions. A correctly operating flued gas heater is usually safe. \n\nNon-flued heaters – also known as unvented heaters, ventfree heaters or flueless fires may be either permanently installed or portable, and sometimes incorporate a catalytic converter. Non-flued heaters can be risky if appropriate safety procedures are not followed. There must be adequate ventilation, they must be kept clean, and they should always be switched off before sleeping. If operating correctly the main emissions of a non-flued gas heater are water vapour and carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.\n\nHome gas heating controls cycle using a mechanical or electronic thermostat. Gas flow is actuated with a valve. Ignition is by electric filament or pilot light. Flames heat a radiator in the air duct but outside the flue, convection or a fan may distribute the heat.\n"}

It was designed to accompany the Kolibri semi-auto pistol or single shot pistol, both marketed as self-defense weapons.\n\nThe name is derived from \"\", the German word for hummingbird, which is among the smallest of birds.\n\nThe cartridge weighs 5.3 grams (82 grains), measures 3 millimeters (0.12 in) at its widest point, and 11 mm (0.43 in) from the base of the primer to the tip of the bullet. The cartridge is headspaced on the mouth of the case. The bullet itself masses 0.2g (3 grains), and is estimated to have a normal muzzle velocity of , resulting in a muzzle energy of 4.0J (3 ft-lbs). For perspective, an average person's punch measures 10-15 joules, meaning that the round has less energy than a punch.\n\nThe round was not well accepted. The 2mm Kolibri's small size makes handling and loading individual cartridges difficult, and the bullet itself is fairly weak, with literature at the time suggesting the round was capable of penetrating only of pine board. The round also suffers some accuracy issues, since the technology of the time was incapable of applying rifling to the bore of such a small caliber, resulting in no spin on the bullet.\n\nDue to the weakness and inaccuracy of the firearm, the 2mm Kolibri was advertised as a ladies self-defense weapon that was small enough to fit inside a handbag. While probably not effective against a mugger if shot at the chest or limbs, it could potentially inflict some damage if shot at the attackers face.\n\nThe series, and most weapons by Franz Pfannl, were discontinued in 1938.\n\nAs with the related firearm series, this gun is now a collector's item with about 1000 ever produced. It is notable for being the smallest centerfire cartridge ever produced.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972641", "title": "Eastman Wind Ensemble", "text": "Eastman Wind Ensemble\n\nThe Eastman Wind Ensemble was founded by Frederick Fennell at the Eastman School of Music in 1952. It is often credited with helping re-define the performance of wind band music. At the time, concert bands used all their players for every piece, regardless of whether the composer had written a part for that instrument. If there was no part for an instrument you had in the band - a contrabass clarinet, perhaps or a string bass - the conductor or the publisher would have an arranger add one. Or you would simply have that instrument double another instrument - the string bass could play the tuba part, for instance. Also, bigger was better, and even though there would normally be three clarinet parts, many university concert bands would have 20 or 30 clarinets, or more.\n\nFennell turned these practices around. The Eastman Wind Ensemble would have one player on each part, and used only the instrumentation for each piece specified by the composer. Fennell coined the term \"wind ensemble\" to refer to this specific kind of wind band. The repertoire of the group included standard concert band pieces, but also chamber music for winds, and the instrumentation varied as required. In contrast to typical concert band practice, the Eastman Wind Ensemble kept its focus on original wind music rather than orchestral transcriptions. The Eastman Wind Ensemble has premiered over 150 works, including works by composers Bernard Rands and Joseph Schwantner.\n\nA series of commercial recordings on the Mercury label spread the influence of Fennell's \"wind ensemble\" concept far beyond the geographic reach of the group's concerts, and helped form a new generation of wind band educators and musicians far beyond Rochester. Many of these recordings are still commercially available (now on CD and download) almost seven decades after they were recorded. \n\nIn 1987, the Eastman Wind Ensemble was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance - Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra) for its 1986 album \"Carnaval\", a collaboration with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is the only first-person account of a \"freedom suit\" and one of the few post-Emancipation published slave narratives.\n\nThe memoir recounts her mother Polly Berry's legal battles in St. Louis, Missouri, for her own and her daughter's freedom from slavery. For her daughter's case, Berry attracted the support of Edward Bates, a prominent Whig politician and judge, and the future US Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. He argued the case of Lucy Ann Berry in court and won in February 1844. Their cases were two of 301 freedom suits filed in St. Louis from 1814 to 1860. Discovered in the late twentieth century, the case files are held by the Missouri Historical Society and searchable online.\n\nFor decades little was known of Lucy Ann Delaney beyond her memoir, but in the late twentieth century, both her and her mother's suits were discovered among case files for 301 freedom suits in St. Louis from 1814–1860. Related material is available online in a searchable database created by the St. Louis Circuit Court Historical Project, in collaboration with Washington University. In addition, scholars have done research into censuses and other historic material related to Delaney's memoir to document the facts.\n\nBorn into slavery in St. Louis, Missouri in 1830, Lucy Ann Berry was the daughter of slaves Polly Berry (born Polly Crocket) and a mulatto father whose name she did not note. They also had a second daughter, Nancy. Polly Crocket and Lucy's father were slaves owned by Major Taylor Berry and his wife, Frances. Lucy said that Polly Berry had been born free in Illinois, but was kidnapped when a child by slave catchers and sold into slavery in Missouri. (In her freedom suit, Polly Berry deposed that she was held as a slave in Wayne County, Kentucky by Joseph Crockett, and was brought by him to Illinois. There they stayed for several weeks while he hired her out for domestic work. As Illinois was a free state, he was supposed to lose his right to hold slave property by staying there, and Polly could have been freed. It was on this basis that she was later awarded freedom, as witnesses were found to testify as to her having been held illegally as a slave in Illinois.\n\nWhen Delaney wrote her memoir late in life, she remembered the Major and his wife Fanny Berry as kind slaveholders. The major told Polly and her husband that his slaves would be freed upon his death and the death of his wife. After the major died in a duel, Fanny Berry married Robert Wash, a lawyer later appointed as a Missouri State Supreme Court judge. When Fanny Wash died, the Berry slave family's fortunes changed. Judge Wash sold Lucy Ann's father to a plantation down the Mississippi River in the Deep South.\n\nPolly Berry became concerned for the safety of her daughters, and determined they should escape. Lucy Ann's older sister Nancy slipped away while traveling with a daughter of the family, Mary Berry Cox, and her new husband on their honeymoon in the North. Nancy left them at Niagara Falls, took the ferry across the river, and safely reached Canada and a friend of her mother's.\n\nAfter having conflict with Mary Cox in 1839, Polly Berry was sold to Joseph A. Magehan, but escaped about three weeks later. She made it to Chicago, but was captured by slave catchers. They returned her to Magehan and slavery in St. Louis.\n\nOn returning, Polly Berry (also known as Polly Wash after her previous master) sued for her freedom in the Circuit Court in the case known as \"Polly Wash v. Joseph A. Magehan\" in October 1839. When her suit was finally heard in 1843, her attorney Harris Sproat was able to convince a jury of her free birth and kidnapping as a child. Wash was freed. She remained in St. Louis to continue her separate effort to secure her daughter Lucy Ann Berry's freedom, for which she had filed suit in 1842, shortly after Berry fled her master.\n\nBy 1842, Lucy Ann was working for Martha Berry Mitchell, another of the Berry daughters. They had conflict in part because of the slave girl's inexperience at heavy domestic tasks, including laundry. Martha decided to sell her, and her husband David D. Mitchell arranged the sale. The day before she was to leave, Lucy Ann escaped and hid at the house of a friend of her mother's.\n\nThat week, Polly Wash filed suit in Circuit Court in St. Louis for Lucy Ann Berry's freedom, as a \"next friend\" to the minor girl. Since her own case had not been settled, Wash was still considered a slave with no legal standing, but under the slave law, she could bring suit on behalf of a minor. The law provided a slave with the status of a \"poor person\", with court-appointed counsel when the court determined the case had grounds. Delaney's memoir suggests that her mother's attorneys suggested her strategy of filing separate suits for her and her daughter, to prevent a jury's worrying about taking too much property from one slaveholder.\n\nThe case was prepared primarily by Francis Butter Murdoch, who litigated nearly one third of the freedom suits filed in St. Louis from 1840–1847. Francis B. Murdoch had served as the Alton, Illinois district attorney, and prosecuted the murder of the printer Elijah Lovejoy by anti-abolitionists. Wash also attracted the support of Edward Bates; a prominent Whig politician and judge, he argued Lucy Ann's case in court. Bates later served as the US Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhile waiting for trial, Lucy Ann Berry was remanded to the jail, where she was held for more than 17 months without being hired out, which was customary to offset expenses and earn money for slaves' masters. In February 1844 the case went to trial. By then her mother's case had been settled, and Polly Wash was declared free. In addition, Wash had affidavits from people who knew her and her daughter. Judge Robert Wash (Fanny Berry Wash's widower and Polly's previous master) testified that Lucy Ann was definitely Polly Berry Wash's child. The jury believed the case for freedom had been proved, and the judge announced Lucy Ann Berry was free. She was approximately 14 years old.\n\nLucy Ann and Polly Berry lived in St. Louis after gaining her freedom. They had to get certificates as free blacks and deal with other restrictions of the time. They worked together as seamstresses.\n\nIn 1845, Lucy Ann met and married steamboat worker Frederick Turner, with whom she settled in Quincy, Illinois, and her mother lived with them. Turner died soon after in a boiler explosion on the steamboat \"The Edward Bates\". (It was named for the lawyer who had helped secure Lucy Ann's freedom two years before.)\n\nPolly Wash and Lucy Ann moved back to St. Louis. In 1849, Lucy Ann met and married Zachariah Delaney. They were married for the rest of their lives, and her mother lived with them. Though the couple had four children, two did not survive infancy; the remaining children, a son and a daughter, both died in their early twenties.\n\nAs Delaney recounted in her memoir, she became active in civic and religious associations. Such organizations grew rapidly in both the African-American and white communities nationally in the years following the Civil War. She joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1855, founded in 1816 in Philadelphia as the first independent black denomination in the US. In addition, Delaney was elected president of the Female Union, an organization of African-American women. She also served as president of the Daughters of Zion, as well as a women's group affiliated with the Freemasons, to which her husband belonged. They often supported community education and health projects.\n\nDelaney belonged to the Col. Shaw Woman's Relief Corps, No. 34, a women's auxiliary to the Col. Shaw Post, 343, Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). The veterans' group was named after the white commanding officer of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first of the United States Colored Troops and a unit that achieved renown for courage in the Civil War. Delaney dedicated her memoir to the GAR, which had fought for the freedom of slaves.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, many blacks migrated to St. Louis from the Deep South for its industrial jobs. Delaney met with new arrivals to try to track down her father. Learning that he was living on a plantation 15 miles south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, she wrote and asked him to visit her. Her sister Nancy from Canada joined their reunion in St. Louis. Their father was glad to see them, but, with his wife Polly dead by then, he returned to Mississippi and his friends of 45 years.\n\nNothing was recorded about the year or circumstances of Lucy Delaney's death.\n\nIn 1891, Delaney published her \"From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom,\" the only first-person account of a freedom suit. The text is also a slave narrative, most of which were published prior to the Civil War and Emancipation. Delaney devoted most of her account to her mother Polly Berry's struggles to free her family from slavery. Though the story is Delaney's, she features her mother as the lead protagonist.\n\nThe narrative is steeped in spirituality. It celebrated what Delaney saw as God's benevolent role in her own life and she attacked the hypocrisy of Christian slave owners. \"From the Darkness\" shows the strength of the African Americans who suffered under slavery, rather than recount the horrors of the institution. By continuing her memoir after her gaining freedom at the age of 14, Delaney showed her fortitude following the death of her first husband, and later the deaths of each of her four children. She portrayed her mother Polly Berry as serving as an adviser and role model. By celebrating her own political and civic activities, Delaney argued for the place of African Americans in US democracy.\n\n\"From the Darkness\" was originally published in St. Louis in 1891 by J.T. Smith. After the rise of the 20th-century Civil Rights Movement and feminism, and new interest in historic black and women's literature, in 1988 the book was reprinted in the collection \"Six Women's Slave Narratives\" by Oxford University Press. It is carried online by Project Gutenberg, as well as by the University of North Carolina in its \"Documents of the American South\" .\n\nThe literary critic P. Gabrielle Foreman has suggested that the author Frances Harper based her character of \"Lucille Delaney\" in the novel \"Iola Leroy\" (1892) on the historic Delaney's memoir published the year before.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2009, an episode from \"Phineas and Ferb\", which he directed entitled \"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\", received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Special Class Short-format Animated Programs.\n\nMoncrief left Montvale, New Jersey in 1989 after graduating from Pascack Hills High School where his father was the vice principal. Among his classmates were Bruce Beresford-Redman and Rick Hurvitz, the executive producers and co-creators of the MTV reality show \"Pimp My Ride\", as well as CNN White House correspondent Dana Bash. Upon completion of high school, he decided to attend California Institute of the Arts, a Disney-funded college specializing in animation.\n\nHe gained an internship on an animated feature, \"The Pagemaster\", and moved on as an assistant animator on the film \"Cats Don't Dance\". While there, he sold a pilot to Fred Seibert (then president of MTV Networks and Hanna-Barbera), for the \"What a Cartoon!\" series titled \"Godfrey and Zeek\". This transitioned into doing story work for Hanna-Barbera's other series, \"Johnny Bravo\".\n\nMoncrief went on to open his own company, creating animation on several CD-ROMs, as well as a commercial work featuring Warner Bros.' Road Runner, the Carl's Jr. spot featuring Dennis Rodman, as well as animation for a GM-sponsored ride at Walt Disney World. Soon after, Seibert came calling again with a new series on Nickelodeon called \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\". There, Moncrief created the shorts \"Kitty the Hapless Cat\", \"Baxter and Bananas\", and also worked on other shorts such as \"The Fairly OddParents\" and the Emmy winning short \"Max and His Special Problem\". He spent his remaining time at Nickelodeon storyboarding in season one of the game-changing series, \"Dora the Explorer\".\n\nShortly thereafter, he was asked to teach at his alma mater (CalArts) and by Walt Disney Television Animation to storyboard on \"Teacher's Pet\", the series (and its theatrical release), as well as direct-to-videos for \"\", \"Kim Possible\", and the network's newest show, \"Brandy and Mr. Whiskers\".\n\nNext, it was off to help bring back a series that has continued to be one of the strongest animated sitcoms in television history, \"Family Guy\". The show's DVD sales had done so incredibly well that 20th Century Fox Television decided to bring the series back for season 4. Moncrief started as an Assistant Director and quickly moved into a Director role working on some of Seth MacFarlane's favorite episodes, such as \"The Griffin Family History\" and \"Barely Legal\". \n\nHe then followed fellow \"Family Guy\" director Dan Povenmire back to Disney again to help direct over 50+ episodes of the hit Disney television series \"Phineas and Ferb\". His job titles allowed him to be involved in every aspect from breaking stories to writing, from storyboarding to design and color, from editing to calling retakes. He was even involved in writing a few of the songs created for this groundbreaking show.\n\nAfter his long run at Disney, he spent three years working at Bento Box as the Supervising Director on Comedy Central's hit show \"Brickleberry\", while also helping to develop shows at Nickelodeon.\n\nIn December 2013, he joined Warner Bros. Animation to produce and revamp the twelfth series in the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise, titled \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\", which debuted in the fall of 2015.\n\nAfter producing close to 52 episodes and almost 2 seasons for Warner Bros., he joined the Nickelodeon family as a Supervising Producer in the fall of 2017 to help oversee and launch a cartoon series based on the hit Dan Schneider television show \"Henry Danger\". This new animated series, titled \"The Adventures of Kid Danger\", debuted on January 15, 2018 as a sneak peek, before its official premiere on January 19. Its ratings were constantly in the top 25, performing better than expected. On its final premiere episodes during the week of June 11–17, 2018, it was the #1 program for K6–11 (it received at 2.91 for boys aged 2–5 and a 3.15 for boys aged 6–11). The show is currently not slated for more episodes.\n\nHis latest adventure has been the lead on the television adaption of the popular Lego augmented reality game app \"Hidden Side\", with the title of supervising director. While working with Pure Imagination Studios, Moncrief created 19 different shorts for Lego, and launched off a 44 minute movie as a way to introduce its newest IP. This IP was ground breaking due to the incredible AR game that could be downloaded and used with the toys once they were built. The game would bring the toys to life when viewed for this interactive game. The television adaption is set to premiere sometime in 2020. \n\nIn 2007, Moncrief returned to Disney to work as a director and writer for \"Phineas and Ferb\". As of December 2012, he had directed over 50 episodes in the series and been credited on over 90+ different credits.\n\nIn 2005, Moncrief left Disney to become a director on the Fox television series \"Family Guy\" for Fox Animation Studios.

Example: If two separate entities can be said to be \"water\", then combining them into one entity will yield more \"water\". If two separate entities can be said to be \"a house\", their combination cannot be said to be \"a house\". Hence, \"water\" has cumulative reference, while the expression \"a house\" does not. The plural form \"houses\", however, \"does\" have cumulative reference. If two (groups of) entities are both \"houses\", then their combination will still be \"houses\".\n\nCumulativity has proven relevant to the linguistic treatment of the mass/count distinction and for the characterization of grammatical telicity.\n\nFormally, a cumulativity predicate \"CUM\" can be defined as follows, where capital \"X\" is a variable over sets, \"U\" is the universe of discourse, \"p\" is a mereological part structure on \"U\", and formula_1 is the mereological sum operation.\n\nformula_2\n\nIn later work, Krifka has generalized the notion to \"n\"-ary predicates, based on the phenomenon of \"cumulative quantification\".

He inherited his ancestors' peerage, \"Prince Yi of the First Rank\", in 1852 during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (r. 1820–50).\n\nZaiyuan took up important positions during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor (r. 1850–61), including a minister in the Imperial Clan Court and an imperial guard commander. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, Zaiyuan and Muyin (穆蔭) travelled to Tongzhou to replace Guiliang (桂良) in the peace negotiations with the British and French. When the negotiations failed, the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen captured the British diplomats Harry Smith Parkes and Henry Loch, Thomas William Bowlby (a journalist for \"The Times\"), and their escorts. The majority of the group – except the two diplomats – died from torture or disease; the survivors were released later. The Anglo-French expeditionary force closed in on Beijing.

He is well known for building immense temples out of recycled wood sheets (discarded from making toys and other punch-outs) for the Burning Man festivals, where they are then burnt to the ground in a spectacle of light and heat.\n\nBest received a master's degree in sculpture from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he first took classes at the age of six. His commitment to public art seems rooted in 1960s-era idealism. His works — ceramic sculpture, collages and more — have been shown at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Oakland Museum, the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, the San Jose Museum of Art, di Rosa and elsewhere.\n\nBest first began collaborating with others, 20 years ago, when he embarked upon a sideline: stripping down vehicles and giving them total sculptural makeovers, using recycled materials and found objects, often retrieved from dumps and dumpsters. Since then, he has created sculptures from the skeletons of 36 cars and two buses, and worked with more than 10,000 people.\n\nBest built his first Burning Man Temple in 2000, The Temple of the Mind. During construction it became a memorial to Michael Hefflin, a member of the crew who died in a motorcycle accident just prior to the event, and as such became a sacred space for remembering others. In 2001, Burning Man helped fund the Temple projects and David, along with Jack Haye who was also responsible for the construction of the Temple of the Mind, built the much larger Temple of Tears. 2001 marked the beginning of a new and profound ritual for the tens of thousands of participants who attend Burning Man each year. After days of writing prayers on the structures, of affixing offerings from one's life such as pictures, paintings, etc., or of leaving the ashes of loved ones, etc. the Temple was burned on Sunday night.\n\nIn 2002, Best returned with a new project: the Temple of Joy. In 2003, David departed from the wood temples and created the ornate paper Temple of Honor. In 2004, the Temple of Stars was a quarter mile long and almost 120’ high. David took a break in 2005 and 2006 to work on personal projects, including the Hayes Green Temple in San Francisco. Returning in 2007, David, Tim Dawson and the temple crew built the Temple of Forgiveness. Best originally suggested he might create one more temple in 2010 or 2011, however the 2010 Temple of Flux and the 2011 Temple of Transition were designed and built by other artists. Best returned in 2012 to design and coordinate the building of the Temple of Juno. In 2014, Best and crew constructed the Temple of Grace.\n\nIn January and February 2019 Best traveled to Coral Springs and Parkland, Florida to build “The Temple of Time” in remembrance of the 17 lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14th, 2018 from a School Shooting. The temple was unveiled on February 14th, 2019 and will remain in place until it is burned in May.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Another theory postulates that the student group responsible for publishing \"The Rebel\" humor magazine designed the Colonel, as this group–known as the \"Rebel Club\"–was founded in 1937 shortly after the University adopted the \"Rebels\" nickname and featured on the magazine's masthead an illustration of the Colonel was identical to the one found in the 1937 annual. Still others maintain that the printing company that published the \"Ole Miss\" annual was responsible for the design. \n\nUniversity of Mississippi historian David Sansing has noted that \"Blind Jim [Ivy] may have been the model for Colonel Rebel,\" citing the late Frank Everett, Jr., a Mississippi historian and prominent alumnus (B.A. '32, LLB '34) of the university. \n\nIvy, blinded as a teenager while working with tar on the Tallahatchie Bridge, originally made his way to Oxford in 1896 and became a peanut vendor. During a baseball game between Ole Miss and the University of Texas, a student told Ivy that Mississippi was losing badly. At that point, “Ivy began cheering the home team on in his famous loud booming voice. The team was strangely inspired by Mr. Ivy’s enthusiastic cheering, and won the game decisively.” From that point on, “Blind Jim” became a campus fixture at the University for the next sixty years and was regarded as one of the most passionate fans of its sports teams, known to proudly tell others that he had \"never seen Ole Miss lose.\" \n\nConcrete evidence has not been found, however, to support the conclusion that Ivy was the basis for Colonel Reb's design.\n\nIvy was very much a part of the university scene when the editor of the school newspaper, \"The Mississippian\", proposed a contest in April 1936 to produce a new nickname for the Ole Miss athletic teams. Prior to this, the teams had been called by various names–the Red and Blue, the Oxfords, the Mighty Mississippians, the Southerners, the Crimson and Blue–and most recently and most popularly up until 1936, the Flood. The \"Mississippian\" received many entries and subsequently placed several names–including Rebels, Raiders, Confederates, Stonewalls, and Ole Miss (without a nickname appendage)–in the hands of 21 sportswriters. Ultimately, \"Rebels\" was the choice of 18 out of the 21 sports writers, a nickname alluding to the University Greys. After five months of contest and polling, the university's athletics committee formally approved the name, and its sports teams have been known as the Rebels ever since. \n\nThe look of the Colonel has been modified several times since those early years, however. The 1941-1942 \"Ole Miss\" features a depiction of Colonel Reb that looks much more like the well-known image that is used to this day. The earliest and most widely recognized version of the “modern” Colonel, however, appeared on the 1946-1947 \"Ole Miss\", adorning the cover in full color and in much more detail. Ole Miss campus bookstore owner Carl Coers and famous New Orleans cartoonist John Churchill Chase may have also had a hand in revising and modifying the Colonel image during those early years. The California company Angelus Pacific also claims that it designed the Colonel; during this era, ex-Disney artist Art C. Evans illustrated dozens of collegiate mascots that became hugely popular across America and are still widely recognizable today.\n\nIn 1940, Ole Miss students began voting for \"Colonel Rebel\" as the highest honorary position for male students on campus (not to be confused with the mascot). This title had previously been called \"The King of Mardi Gras,\" but this name was changed by the Associated Student Body executive council in the fall of 1939. This distinction was made in addition to the female equivalent (\"Miss Ole Miss\"), which had been bestowed upon female students on campus for over a decade. Several distinguished Ole Miss alumni have been elected to one of these two positions, including former University of Mississippi Chancellor Robert Khayat. In 1975, former National Football League standout Ben Williams became the first black student to be elected \"Colonel Reb.\" \"Gentle Ben\", as he is affectionately known by many in the Ole Miss community, was also the first black football player at Ole Miss. In 1989, star Ole Miss women's basketball player Kimsey O'Neal became the first black student to gain the title \"Miss Ole Miss.\" One year later, in 1990, Roy Lee \"Chucky\" Mullins, the Rebel athlete who suffered a devastating football injury in 1989 that left him a quadriplegic, was elected \"Colonel Reb\" by the student body. \n\nIn 2013, the Associated Student Body at the University officially changed the name of this honorary title from \"Colonel Reb\" to \"Mr. Ole Miss.\"\n\nAs was the trend among many American colleges and universities during the 1970s, the university adopted a costumed mascot, based on its popular \"Colonel Rebel\" design. Thus, in 1979, Colonel Reb advanced from his 40-year history on paper to a living caricature on the field. The role was filled by a male cheerleader, and the character was first called \"Johnny Reb.\" Throughout the early 1980s, the Ole Miss cheerleading team gained widespread recognition as one of the \"top squads\" in the nation: the Colonel was named \"Best Mascot in the S.E.C.\" in his first year, and he also helped lead the Rebels to third- and first-place distinctions by the National Cheerleading Association (\"NCA\") and the Universal Cheerleading Association (\"UCA\"), respectively, among 99 competing universities. The Colonel was also on hand to welcome former President Gerald Ford when he visited the University of Mississippi in 1981.\n\nFor a brief period during the early 1980s, the Colonel also joined members of the Rebel cheerleading squad in traveling to several NBA games to perform at halftime shows, in which the group would use mini-trampolines and perform flashy, acrobatic slam-dunks and other basketball stunts. (This group, which featured Colonel Reb in its earliest performances, was originally known as the \"Dixie Daredevils,\" but it eventually rebranded as the \"Bud Light Daredevils\" after obtaining a sponsorship from Budweiser.)\nThe Colonel would continue to turn in strong performances throughout the 1980s: in 1986, he earned \"SEC Mascot of the Year\" honors and was named the Runner-Up for \"National Mascot of the Year\" (finishing only behind Cocky of the South Carolina Gamecocks). During that same year, he was also honored as the \"National Mascot Fundraiser Champion\" for his fundraising efforts for juvenile diabetes research and charitable appearances for United Way. \n\nIn 2003, the administration–concerned about some in the public who perceived a connection between the character and the Old South–removed Colonel Reb from the sidelines at Ole Miss athletic events as the official on-field mascot, though he was allowed at tailgates and other unofficial university functions. A contest was held in which fans were invited to design a replacement. The athletic department chose two finalists, Rebel Bruiser and Rowdy Rebel, and encouraged fans to vote on their favorite. The limited fan response, as well as ridicule from fans of rival schools, prompted the administration to cancel the poll. \n\nIn 2010, the University announced it would establish a student committee to choose a new mascot for the school's teams. A website was then established by the committee in an effort to promote transparency throughout the process. After months of analyzing responses and feedback, including the final poll, the committee ultimately selected the Black Bear as the new on-field mascot and named it \"Rebel\". \n\nThe Colonel Reb Foundation, a student group founded in support of reinstating Colonel Reb as the university's mascot, has sponsored the unofficial appearances of the mascot in The Grove on game day. The University has reclassified the Colonel Reb trademark as historical and still retains ownership of the trademark.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972708", "title": "Battle of annihilation", "text": "Battle of annihilation\n\nAnnihilation is a military strategy in which an attacking army seeks to entirely destroy the military capacity of the opposing army. This strategy can be executed in a single planned pivotal battle, called a \"battle of annihilation.\" A successful battle of annihilation is accomplished through the use of tactical surprise, application of overwhelming force at a key point, or other tactics performed immediately before or during the battle.\n\nThe end goal of a battle of annihilation is to cause the leaders of the opposing army to sue for peace due to the complete annihilation of its army and thus inability to further engage in offensive or defensive military action. It is not necessary to kill or capture all, or even most, of an opposing army's forces to annihilate it in the sense used here. Rather, the destruction of the enemy army as a cohesive military force able to offer further meaningful military offense or defense, even if temporarily, is the objective.\n\nIn ancient and classical times, many battles ended with the annihilation of one of the opposing forces, the battles of Cannae, Zama and Adrianople being famous examples. From the Renaissance onward, however, the battle of annihilation strategy fell into disuse, at least in Europe. The greatest exception is seen in the battles of Napoleon Bonaparte, and it is with Napoleon that the battle of annihilation in the modern sense is most closely associated, so that term \"Napoleonic battle of annihilation\" is sometimes used, and the Battle of Austerlitz is often cited as the paragon of the modern battle of annihilation.\n\nNapoleon's victories at Austerlitz (1805) and Jena (1806) are often cited as the classic battles of annihilation. Napoleon himself was unable to again achieve such decisive results, partly because his enemies subsequently adjusted to his tactics. For example, Borodino, while a victory, did not result in the desired destruction of the Russian army.\n\nNevertheless, strategists, influenced by those of the Napoleonic era, most notably Antoine-Henri Jomini, held the Napoleonic battle of annihilation to be the proper objective of modern military campaigns. This interpretation was later accredited to the more renowned Carl von Clausewitz, initially by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder who supported arguments for strategies of annihilation with quotes from Clausewitz. Clausewitz, who disliked Jomini personally, as well as his concepts, may have instead emphasized the primacy of the political in warfare, and remained indifferent to theories arguing for any absolute solutions via the application of military force. Nevertheless, this set the stage for mass confusion down the line of strategic thinkers. Clausewitz's trilogies (albeit used out of context) are contested by Liddell Hart, who claims in \"Strategy\" that a poor choice of words by Clausewitz led his interpreters to overestimate the value of annihilation battles. Consequently, at the beginning of the American Civil War, many top military commanders expected a battle of annihilation to quickly end the war. This did not occur. Already, the size and firepower of armies were making the battle of annihilation harder to achieve.\n\nA contrast may be seen between the Confederate general Robert E. Lee and the Union general Ulysses S. Grant. Lee, when on the offensive, usually maneuvered with the intent of forcing a battle of annihilation. His archetypal attempt was at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where a classic Napoleonic flanking maneuver defeated but was not able to destroy the Union Army under Joseph Hooker. Lee may be faulted for attempting to achieve a battle of annihilation, particularly at Gettysburg. In contrast, Grant was noted for waging campaigns of maneuver. In the Vicksburg campaign, he forced Pemberton's army into a siege position where it was forced to surrender without a battle. In the Virginia campaign of 1864 against Lee, he continually maneuvered around Lee, forcing him to withdraw further and further south until he had to choose between abandoning the Confederate capital of Richmond or withdrawing into siege lines. William Tecumseh Sherman may also be cited. Rather than pursuing the chimera of destroying Hood's army, he chose to operate directly against the Confederate economy. His famous march through Georgia, directly \"away\" from Hood, was basically the opposite of a Napoleonic strategy.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussians (and later Germans) made their own version of the battle of annihilation by destroying entire armies in a relatively short time by means of rapid troop movement and rapid encirclement of the enemy. This tactic came into fruition during the decisive battles of Metz and Sedan where two main French armies were completely annihilated at the same time and in a relatively short span of time, rendering France almost completely defenseless against the German invasion. This tactic later served as an inspiration for the blitzkrieg during World War II where highly mobile formations would execute a battle of annihilation by charging straight into the enemy's weak point and attempt to encircle and destroy separate enemy pockets; this tactic became spectacularly successful during the German invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union until they themselves became annihilated by the Soviets in battles such as Stalingrad, Belorussia and Berlin.\n\nThe Napoleonic ideal was still alive at the beginning of World War I. In fact, the Germans were able to execute a battle of annihilation against the Russian 2nd Army at the Battle of Tannenberg in the war's opening weeks. But attempts to create such a result on the Western Front resulted in great slaughter to no effect. Armies were now too large to have flanks to turn, and had too much firepower and too much defensive depth to be broken by assault.\n\nDuring the Pacific War, the Imperial Japanese Navy's strategy was fixated on the goal of luring the numerically superior United States Pacific Fleet into a single decisive battle of annihilation, which would force the United States to sue for peace. This was at least partially the motivation behind the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway, but was loosely followed for as long as the IJN was capable of offensive operations. This goal was never achieved for several reasons. First, the US Navy was wary of committing all of its forces to one major battle. Further, the IJN concentrated so much of its efforts on preparing for a single massive showdown (which never truly occurred) that it neglected devoting resources towards protecting its naval supply lines, which soon fell prey to a Fabian strategy when they were extensively targeted by US submarines. Even Japanese victories such as the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands failed to utterly annihilate their opponents. The hoped-for \"decisive battle\" against the US Navy never came, and the IJN was gradually ground down through attrition.\n\nSince World War I, the paradigm of armies maneuvering in the empty countryside for weeks and then meeting in a battle lasting (usually) a single day no longer applies (at least to wars between major powers). Instead, armies are deployed in more-or-less continuous lines stretching perhaps hundreds of miles. Thus, the battle of annihilation may be considered to be mainly of historical interest, except for secondary campaigns.\n\nInitially, it might seem that annihilation of the opposing army is the obvious object of any military campaign. However, many battles have been fought to cause an enemy army simply to retreat, or to suffer attrition, and many campaigns have been waged to avoid, rather than seek, such a battle. Reasons for not seeking a battle of annihilation include the following:\n\nA successful battle of annihilation usually requires exposing one's own army to loss in a way that more conservative tactics do not. For example, attempting to turn an enemy's flank generally requires one to separate the flanking force from one's main body. This exposes the attacking force to defeat in detail. Attempting to pierce the enemy's center is usually costly in itself, and also exposes the vanguard force to a destructive counterstrike.\n\nThis was an especially important consideration during the pre-Napoleonic era, when armies were relatively small forces composed of professional career soldiers and losses were difficult to replace. Besides, weakening one's own army might expose it to other enemies, or political struggles, and even internal enemies: a pretender to the throne or a coalition of nobles might challenge the king, a province might rebel to the central government or a third nation could exploit the situation, while the main army suffered heavy casualties after the battle.\n\nWinning a battle with a high cost is commonly referred to as a Pyrrhic victory. Pyrrhus of Epirus obtained a decisive battle against the Romans, but suffered so heavy casualties that was unable to continue the campaign and went instead to Sicily, trying to raise new forces and form a coalition of Greek cities. Later the Romans were able to train new levies and avenge the battle by defeating Pyrrhus.\n\nFrom the Renaissance until the advent of military mechanization, armies were slow \"on the battlefield\" (not necessarily slow operationally). This was due to the declining efficacy of cavalry and to the advent of artillery, which is difficult to move. This made it difficult to move quickly enough to prevent an enemy from countering a battle stratagem, or, failing that, to withdraw safely.\n\nIf the object of war is to destroy the enemy's ability to resist politically, this may be achieved by other, less expensive, methods.\n\nFor example, one may attempt to maneuver one's army in such a way as to cut off the enemy from its base of supplies. If this is done successfully, the enemy may be forced to seek terms with its army intact. This sort of campaign was typical of Enlightenment armies, and is especially associated with the campaigns of Frederick the Great.\n\nThe French Campaign of 1940 offers an example. After the Germans broke into the French rear at Sedan, they were able to surround the main Allied armies and render their position untenable. No great battle of annihilation was required. (Alternatively, the Germans considered instead striking toward Paris. Capture of Paris might have broken the French morale and \"political\" will to resist).\n\nDuring antiquity, an example is the Battle of the Caudine Forks. Despite the name, it was not a battle: the Samnites managed to trick and deceive a Roman army, leading it inside a valley surrounded by mountains. The Romans were trapped and could only surrender.\n\nIn warfare, as in many avenues of human endeavor, the optimal application of material means is sometimes limited by the failure of imagination. A successful battle of annihilation generally requires great skill and daring on the part of the attacking commander. If a commander's training, experience, and peer relationships have not prepared him to expect a battle of annihilation, this alone may prevent him envisioning such a battle.\n\nFor example, during the American Civil War, several Union Army generals were not able to imagine a battle of annihilation even during opportunities when the Union Army of the Potomac had sufficient strength in forces and the material means to conduct such a battle.\n\nA war with limited political objectives may require the adoption of a limited military strategy, including the avoidance of a battle of annihilation.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Caudine Forks, the Samnite commander, Gaius Pontius was persuaded to send a letter to his father, Herennius, asking what to do with the trapped Roman forces. The reply came back that the Romans should be sent on their way unharmed as quickly as possible because if the Simnites let the Romans free without harm, they would gain the Romans' friendship. However, his advice was rejected, and Herennius then proposed to kill the entire Roman army so that Rome would be so weakened that they would not pose a threat for many generations. He insisted that any middle way would be utter folly and would leave the Romans smarting for revenge without weakening them.\n\nThe Battle of the Catalaunian Plains is commonly referred to as a victory of the coalition led by the Roman general, Flavius Aetius, and the Visigothic king, Theodoric I, against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. However, the battle was tactically inconclusive: although the Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul and installed Merovech as king of the Franks, the defeated Hunnic army retained much of its manpower, and the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. It has been speculated that Aetius wanted not to destroy the Huns but to settle down an agreement with Attila, pacify the horde and maybe even draft mercenaries from it while Aetius maintained order among his Germanic allies by the threat of a common enemy. Without the Huns, the Germans would later turn against the Romans. However, Aetius' death prevented such a plan to develop, if sought.\n\nIn the Gulf War, the Allied forces could have sought and won a battle of annihilation against the Iraqi Republican Guard. It was decided, however, that the annihilation of the Republican Guard might have led to the dissolution of the Iraqi state.\n\nIf a side in a war is willing enough, such as by religious zeal, nationalism or ideological belief, defeat or surrender to the enemy can be seen as worse than death and thus being rejected. Humiliation and war honor are common reasons, but also fear of torture, pillage, enslavement or other crimes might convince that fighting to the end is better than surrendering. Military forces fighting fanatically have also been documented to be common after reports of brutal treatment, such as murder and rape, against the civilians of that nation.\n\nThat can be especially true when the opposing side is seen as ultimately untrustworthy or despicable, and bloodshed in a merciless battle can feed that opinion. Suffering such a defeat might rise up morale and determination in the defeated side, which, instead of surrendering, might spend all its manpower and resources into war seeking revenge and ultimate victory. If surrounded and without means of recover, the defeated side might force the enemy to lay siege to an important fort or city before claiming victory, leading to unwanted casualties, attrition and delay. That can turn the aftermath of a victorious battle of annihilation into a slow strategic and political defeat.\n\nThe Punic Wars are a common example of war fury and obstinacy, especially after a ruining defeat. During the Second Punic War, the Carthaginian commander Hannibal was able to defeat the Romans in four major battles, culminating in the Battle of Cannae in which an army of 80,000 Roman legionaries was annihilated with a huge number of deaths from soldiers to important officers and senators. However, Hannibal's proposals of peace were rejected, and the Romans started to fortify the city for a supposed final assault. Hannibal's forces never laid siege to Rome and instead moved to Capua. Many historians agree that the decision was due to Hannibal's army not having enough manpower and machines to lay siege since promised reinforcements from Carthage never came. The Romans later recovered, defeated Hannibal at the Battle of Zama, and in the end won the war.\n\nDuring the Texas Revolution, Mexican troops launched an assault to a fort in the Battle of Alamo, killing all of the Texan defenders and annihilating the whole militia and garrison forces. General Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texans, both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States, to join the Texan Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texans defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution.\n\nDuring Operation Barbarossa, German forces encountered friendly partisans and volunteers called Hilfswillige who joined them to oppose the Soviet Union. An example is the Russian Liberation Army. However, the Nazi policy of occupation and colonization with exploitation, pillaging, massacre of eastern civilians seen as slaves and inferior beings (Generalplan Ost), the acts of the Einsatzgruppen, and the lack of mercy against prisoners and defeated enemies ultimately alienated any definitive support that they could have had from Russians and other ethnicities in Soviet Union against their leaders. That behaviour led Stalin to proclaim the Great Patriotic War, gaining consensus in the face of the enemy invader and raising population and morale against the enemy.\n\n\n"}

It was remade in April 2020 with a new series starring Marc Warren in the titular role, again produced for ITV. Adaptations of the original stories have also been made for film and radio.\n\n\nThe television series was based on the characters and atmosphere, but not the plots, of the original novels. The stories are mostly based in and around Amsterdam, where Commissaris van der Valk is a cynical yet intuitive detective. Drugs, sex and murder are among the gritty themes of the casework, contrasted against picturesque Amsterdam locations. In the opening credits of the first series van der Valk is standing on the tower of the Westerkerk.\n\nVan der Valk also contrasts with his naïve assistant, Inspecteur Johnny Kroon, played by Michael Latimer, and his superior, Hoofd-commissaris Samson, who deals with the political fallout of the cases. (Samson was played by three actors over the course of the show: Martin Wyldeck for two episodes in 1972, Nigel Stock for 12 episodes in 1977, and lastly Ronald Hines for the revival in 1991–92.) Van der Valk's French wife Arlette was played by three actresses over the course of the show's twenty-year run: initially by Susan Travers, Joanna Dunham for the third series, and finally Meg Davies for the 1991-92 revival. Other actors in the series included Alan Haines who played Brig Mertens, and Richard Huw who played Van Der Valk's son Wim, also a police detective, in the revival.\n\nThe signature tune, \"Eye Level\", composed by Jack Trombey (a pseudonym of Dutch composer Jan Stoeckart) and performed by the Simon Park Orchestra, reached number one in the UK singles charts in 1973. Also that year, Matt Monro charted with a vocal version titled \"And You Smiled\". In the final TV series, the theme was played at a slightly faster tempo than previously.\n\nThe original series were all produced by Thames Television for ITV. The first and second series were recorded on 2\" quadruplex videotape at Thames' Teddington Studios in London, with location scenes shot in Amsterdam on 16mm film.\nThe third series was generally made on location, entirely on 16mm film, by Thames's subsidiary Euston Films.\nThe fourth series was recorded on Panasonic MII videotape, with location shooting shot on 35mm film. Series five was similarly shot, but with the studio recording on D-3 videotape. The final two series were transmitted in stereo sound using the NICAM system.\nThe Network imprint released all five series on Region 2 DVD on 22 October 2007.\n\nVan der Valk also appears in the second and final parts of \"The Four Oaks Mystery\", part of the 1992 ITV Telethon. In it, four fictional detectives - Sherlock Holmes, Van der Valk, Taggart and Inspector Wexford - take turns in solving the story of a buried hoard of Roman jewels. The four mini-episodes, each about ten minutes long, were broadcast at two episodes a night across the weekend of 18-19 July .\n\nMost episodes in series 4 and 5 show the Amsterdam police headquarters in Marnixstrat.\n\n\nA series of three 90-minute episodes, with Marc Warren in the title role, was released in 2020. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV, in Australia on ABC-TV, in the United States by PBS Masterpiece, in New Zealand on Vibe and in Germany by ARD Degeto.

However, the rights to the title were still held by Electronic Arts, and thus a new title and setting were needed for the game. It was derived in part from the Sumerian legends of Gilgamesh, with the chief villain of the game being named Namtar. Since to this point the game didn't feature any dragons, the new title meant that Heineman had to add one.\n\nInterplay advertisements displayed the slogan \"Bard's Tale Fans Rejoice!\" above the game's name, and mentioned \"Dragon Wars\" ability to import \"Bard's Tale\" characters. The designers all felt it was a better game than \"Bard's Tale III\", and indeed, better than any of the \"Bard's Tale\" series, but without the tie-in to the old title and without \"Electronic Arts\"'s marketing muscle, the game did not fare as well.\n\nTo defend against pirated copies of the game, Dragon Wars included a collection of numbered paragraphs within their manual. Players would receive an in-game message (i.e. \"Read paragraph 23\"), and have to refer back to the printed material. The game is very difficult to play without references to the paragraphs, and many parts become meaningless. This form of security was widely used at the time.\n\n\"Dragon Wars\" was reviewed in 1989 in \"Dragon\" #152 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Scorpia gave the game a positive review in \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1989, noting improvements over the \"Bard's Tale\" series, saying that, \"Tighter design, attention to detail, balanced combat, and a carefully constructed plotline all combine to produce a CRPG well worth playing.\" In 1993 she stated that the game was \"a good choice when you want something a bit more than a standard slicer/dicer\".\n\nThe game was later included in the \"Interplay's 10 Year Anthology Classic Collection\" released in 1993.\n\n"}
{"id": "1972737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972737", "title": "Brian Macdonald (choreographer)", "text": "Brian Macdonald (choreographer)\n\nBrian Ronald Macdonald, (May 14, 1928 – November 29, 2014) was a Canadian dancer, choreographer and director of opera, theatre and musical theatre.\n\nBrian Macdonald was born in Montreal, Quebec on May 14, 1928. His father Ian was Irish and worked at Dominion Glass Co. as a sales manager while his mother Mabel Lee was Scottish. Macdonald was a child actor for Radio-Canada and studied piano.\n\nIn 1959 Macdonald's first wife Olivia Wyatt died in an automobile accident. Macdonald became a single father, raising his three-year-old son. Macdonald met his second wife Annette av Paul while the artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet. They married in 1964.\n\nHe died on November 29, 2014 in Stratford, Ontario of bone cancer.\n\nMacdonald was taking a B.A. in English at McGill University when he began ballet classes with noted teachers Gerald Crevier and Elizabeth Leese. From 1947-1949 he was music critic for the Montreal Herald. Macdonald joined the National Ballet of Canada in 1951 and was one of its founding members. He left the company in 1953 due to a serious arm injury.\n\nEarly on in his dance training Macdonald was inspired to study choreography, affected by the Ballets Russes rehearsal of \"Concerto Barocco\" by George Balanchine in Montreal. He was struck by the way the ballerinas were dancing en pointe and in high heels.\n\nIn 1956 he established his own company called the Montreal Theatre Ballet. He went on to create works for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet such as \"The Darkling\" in 1958 and \"Les Whoops De Doo\" in 1959. One of his most acclaimed works was \"Time Out of Mind\" created for Joffrey Ballet in 1963. He choreographed \"Rose Latulippe\" in 1966, which was Canada's first evening-length ballet performance and the first full-length colour production filmed by the Canadian Broadcasting Company.\n\nHe was artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1964–1967 and artistic director of Harkness Ballet from 1967-1968, during which time he choreographed \"Canto Indio\". He then moved on to become artistic director of Israel's Batsheva Dance Theatre from 1971–1972 and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens from 1974-1977, where he choreographed \"Tam Ti Delam\" in 1974 and \"Lignes et Pointes\". In 1978 Macdonald choreographed \"Double Quartet\" which features a young woman and her admirers dancing to the string quartets of Schubert and R. Murray Schafer.\n\nMacdonald's last choreographic work was \"Requiem 9/11\", which premiered at the National Arts Centre in 2002. The piece was Macdonald's perspective of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, performed to Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem. The ballet was danced in front of images of violent events from history. The dancers were covered in ash-looking makeup to reflect the appearance of survivors fleeing the World Trade Center buildings. The dance was well received by audience members and critics. Hugh Winsor from \"The Globe and Mail\", who was present at the inaugural performance, wrote that the audience gave the show \"an extended standing ovation.\"\n\nIn 1957, Macdonald and his wife, Olivia choreographed the satirical revue \"My Fur Lady\" which went on a national tour of over 400 performances. In 1968 Macdonald directed \"Maggie Flynn\" for its premiere on Broadway.\n\nMacdonald moved to Stratford, Ontario and became an associate director of the Stratford Festival. He became known for reviving Gilbert and Sullivan operettas to critical acclaim. He directed \"The Mikado\" in 1982 which toured the world until it made its debut on Broadway. It earned Macdonald Tony Award nominations for Best Choreography and Best Direction of a Musical. Macdonald's last directed musical at the Stratford Festival was \"The Music Man\" in 1996, ending 17 seasons with the Stratford Festival.\n\nMacdonald's debut as an opera director was \"Cosi fan tutte\" by Wolfgang Mozart in 1972. This was followed by Massenet's \"Cendrillon\" in 1979 and \"Madama Butterfly\" in 1990.\n\nHis final work was a revival his 1990 staging of \"Madama Butterfly\" with the Canadian Opera Company in 2014. The show was praised for the talent of the cast in their vocal abilities. The show was criticised for a lack of emotional connection between the performers, with Richard Ouzounian of the \"Toronto Star\" saying, \"[T]he whole thing now has that \"paint by the numbers\" kind of feel about it, with everyone coughing up lungfuls of emotion, but rarely connecting to each other at all in any genuine way.\" Robert Harris of \"The Globe and Mail\" commented that the show struggled to overcome issues of racism and prejudice that exist in the opera.\n\nIn 1982 Macdonald became the head of the Banff Centre's Summer Dance Program. He split the program into a training section and a professional section which performed remounted works by Macdonald, George Balanchine and winners of the Clifford E Lee Choreographic Award. Some of his students have included Johnny Wright, the male lead in the West End production of Dirty Dancing, and Crystal Pite. He was head of the program until 2001 when he became artistic advisor from 2001-2007.\n\n\n"}

It is a waxy white solid with a sweet odor. Its primary use is to couple amino acids during artificial peptide synthesis. The low melting point of this material allows it to be melted for easy handling. It is highly soluble in dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide, but insoluble in water.\n\nThe C-N=C=N-C core of carbodiimides (N=C=N) is linear, being related to the structure of allene. The molecule has idealized C symmetry.\n\nThe N=C=N moiety gives characteristic IR spectroscopic signature at 2117 cm. The N NMR spectrum shows a characteristic shift of 275 ppm upfield of nitric acid and the C NMR spectrum features a peak at about 139 ppm downfield from TMS.\n\nOf the several syntheses of DCC, Pri-Bara \"et al.\" use palladium acetate, iodine, and oxygen to couple cyclohexyl amine and cyclohexyl isocyanide. Yields of up to 67% have been achieved using this route:\n\nTang \"et al.\" condense two isocyanates using the catalyst OP(MeNCHCH)N in yields of 92%:\n\nDCC has also been prepared from dicyclohexylurea using a phase transfer catalyst by Jaszay \"et al.\" The disubstituted urea, arenesulfonyl chloride, and potassium carbonate react in toluene in the presence of benzyl triethylammonium chloride to give DCC in 50% yield.\n\nDCC is a dehydrating agent for the preparation of amides, ketones, nitriles. In these reactions, DCC hydrates to form dicyclohexylurea (DCU), a compound that is nearly insoluble in most organic solvents and insoluble in water. The majority of the DCU is thus readily removed by filtration, although the last traces can be difficult to eliminate from non-polar products. DCC can also be used to invert secondary alcohols. In the Steglich esterification, alcohols, including even some tertiary alcohols, can be esterified using a carboxylic acid in the presence of DCC and a catalytic amount of DMAP.\n\nIn protein synthesis (such as Fmoc solid-state synthesizers), the N-terminus is often used as the attachment site on which the amino acid monomers are added. To enhance the electrophilicity of carboxylate group, the negatively charged oxygen must first be \"activated\" into a better leaving group. DCC is used for this purpose. The negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile, attacking the central carbon in DCC. DCC is temporarily attached to the former carboxylate group forming a highly electrophilic intermediate, making nucleophilic attack by the terminal amino group on the growing peptide more efficient.\n\nIn combination with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DCC effects the so-called Pfitzner-Moffatt oxidation. This procedure is used for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones. Unlike metal-mediated oxidations, such as the Jones oxidation, the reaction conditions are sufficiently mild to avoid over-oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Generally, three equivalents of DCC and 0.5 equivalent of proton source in DMSO are allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The reaction is quenched with acid.\n\n\nDCC is a classical inhibitor of ATP synthase. DCC inhibits ATP synthase by binding to one of the \"c\" subunits and causing steric hindrance of the rotation of the F subunit.\n\nDCC is a potent allergen and a sensitizer, often causing skin rashes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972759", "title": "Sony Ericsson K750", "text": "Sony Ericsson K750\n\nThe Sony Ericsson K750, introduced in June 2005, was a high-end mobile phone, the successor to the now discontinued K700, and which was succeeded by the K800i in Q2 2006.\n\nBefore official release, K750 was known by its codename Clara.\n\nThere also was a T-Mobile exclusive version called D750i. Its hardware was similar to the K750i had T-Mobile branding with a light blue/white body and looked very similar to the Sony Ericsson W800.\n\nThe K750i is a candybar style phone that weighs 99 grams (3.5 ounces), with its buttons that can be used with any finger. It has the 'dual-front' design common to most Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the T610, with the back of the mobile phone designed like a digital camera and intended to be held sideways to take photographs. The K750i is available in four colours, Blue, Oxidized Black, metallic red and Blasted Silver (the latter of which is exclusive to Vodafone in the United Kingdom) with a red version later released. The central joystick button is used for selecting options and navigating menus, with the \"C\" button as an 'undo' or 'delete' button, and the arrow-labelled button as a 'return' or 'back' button. The two buttons labelled by white horizontal lines, known as 'hotkeys' or 'soft keys' perform the function of making binary decisions, labelled on the phone's display. The button in between of these 'soft keys' acts as a shortcut key, which brings up a user-customisable shortcut menu when pressed. The on/off button is located on the top of the phone next to the IrDA port.\n\nThere is one side key on the left of the phone; when pressed in standby mode, it opens either the RDS FM radio or the Media Player as selected by the user, allowing playback of WAV/MP3/AAC audio files, and 3GP/MPEG-4 video files. A press of this button in media player mode plays or pauses the selected media. <br>\nThe RDS FM radio has 20 user-configurable presets. <br>\nThe phone also features Sony's Mega Bass technology. \n\nThe left-hand side of the phone also houses the Memory Stick PRO Duo slot for external solid state memory, which is protected by a flexible rubber cover.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the phone there are three keys - two for controlling volume, skipping through tracks in the Media Player and zooming in and out when in camera mode. If the button is pressed when the headset isn't attached the phone displays a phone status screen showing profile, memory usage, battery level, and, on some mobile networks, phone number. The included handsfree headset is also required to listen to the radio since it functions as the antenna.\n\nScreen\n\nMemory\n\nNetworks\n\nAvailable colors\n\nSizes\n\nWeight\n\nBattery\n\nCamera\n\nThe phone has good all-round support for many versions of the MP3 file format, however support for WAV encoded files is not as extensive.\n\nAAC support is good, and the phone can only properly handle LC AAC. HE-AAC (a.k.a. AAC+, a.k.a. eAAC) will play since HE-AAC is designed to be backwards compatible, however the SBR component will be ignored. The same is true with HE-AAC v2 (a.k.a. eAAC+), only the normal LC component of the file will be played. The SBR and parametric stereo (introduced with HE-AAC v2) is ignored. Since HE-AAC v2 encodes the sound as a mono-aural track and the stereo separation is recreated through the PS data, HE-AAC v2 files played on a K750 actually play back in mono. \n\nThe phone can also be used as a modem via Bluetooth, Infrared or USB. According to the Sony Ericsson website, the K750 has a talk time battery life of 9 hours and a standby time battery life of 600 hours.\n\nSince K750i and W800i are essentially two phones with exactly same hardware specifications, soft modifications are available to convert a K750i to a W800i by using flashing software and the firmware files of the W800i model. Such modified phone will be able to use the Walkman feature which is available to W series phones only.\n\nSuch phone can also use the flight mode option which allows the phone to work only as a media player while other functions, like cellphone radio system, are turned off. This option is useful when in places where mobile phone transmitters should be turned off. The Activity Menu will not be present which appears when the button between the left and right softkey is pressed. Instead the Walkman player appears when it is pressed. This modification will revoke any remaining warranty for the phone.\n\nModding also called as flashing is done by software such as XS++ or Far Manager or SE tool.\n\n\nAdditionally the K750 shares its hardware with the lesser known D750, which has the interface of the K750, yet has a chassis similar to that of the W800.\n\n"}

Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. The center is part of the American Museum of Natural History, where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.\n\nTyson studied at Harvard University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University. From 1991 to 1994, he was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the \"Universe\" column for \"Natural History\" magazine, some of which were later published in his books \"Death by Black Hole\" (2007) and \"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry\" (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in \"StarDate\" magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name \"Merlin\". Material from the column appeared in his books \"Merlin's Tour of the Universe\" (1998) and \"Just Visiting This Planet\" (1998). Tyson served on a 2001 government commission on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry and on the 2004 Moon, Mars and Beyond commission. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show \"NOVA ScienceNow\" on PBS. Since 2009, Tyson has hosted the weekly podcast \"StarTalk\". A spin-off, also called \"StarTalk\", began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series \"\", a successor to Carl Sagan's 1980 series \"\". The U.S. National Academy of Sciences awarded Tyson the Public Welfare Medal in 2015 for his \"extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science\".\n\nTyson was born in Manhattan as the second of three children, into a family living in the Bronx. His mother, Sunchita Maria Tyson (née Feliciano), was a gerontologist for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and is of Puerto Rican descent. His African-American father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson (1927–2016), was a sociologist, human resource commissioner for New York City mayor John Lindsay, and the first Director of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited. Tyson has two siblings: Stephen Joseph Tyson and Lynn Antipas Tyson. Tyson's middle name, deGrasse, is from the maiden name of his paternal grandmother, who was born as Altima de Grasse in the British West Indies island of Nevis.\n\nTyson grew up in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, and later in Riverdale. From kindergarten throughout high school, Tyson attended public schools in the Bronx: P.S. 36, P.S. 81, the Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy (then called \"P.S. 141\"), and The Bronx High School of Science (1972–1976) where he was captain of the wrestling team and editor-in-chief of the \"Physical Science Journal\". His interest in astronomy began at the age of nine after visiting the sky theater of the Hayden Planetarium. He recalled that \"so strong was that imprint [of the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter, that in fact, the universe called me.\" During high school, Tyson attended astronomy courses offered by the Hayden Planetarium, which he called \"the most formative period\" of his life. He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his \"first intellectual role model\" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.\n\nTyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen. Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was a faculty member at Cornell University, tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for undergraduate studies. In his book, \"The Sky Is Not the Limit\", Tyson wrote:\n\nTyson revisited this moment on his first episode of \"\". Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in Ithaca. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, \"I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of \"person\" I wanted to become.\"\n\nTyson chose to attend Harvard where he majored in physics and lived in Currier House. He was a member of the crew team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, lettering in his senior year. He was also active in dance, in styles including jazz, ballet, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin Ballroom.\n\nTyson earned an AB degree in physics at Harvard College in 1980 and then began his graduate work at the University of Texas at Austin, from which he received an MA degree in astronomy in 1983. By his own account, he did not spend as much time in the research lab as he should have. His professors encouraged him to consider alternative careers and the committee for his doctoral dissertation was dissolved, ending his pursuit of a doctorate from the University of Texas.\n\nTyson was a lecturer in astronomy at the University of Maryland from 1986 to 1987 and in 1988, he was accepted into the astronomy graduate program at Columbia University, where he earned an MPhil degree in astrophysics in 1989, and a PhD degree in astrophysics in 1991 under the supervision of Professor R. Michael Rich. Rich obtained funding to support Tyson's doctoral research from NASA and the ARCS foundation enabling Tyson to attend international meetings in Italy, Switzerland, Chile, and South Africa and to hire students to help him with data reduction. In the course of his thesis work, he observed using the 0.91 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, where he obtained images for the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey helping to further their work in establishing Type Ia supernovae as standard candles.\n\nDuring his thesis research at Columbia University, Tyson became acquainted with Professor David Spergel at Princeton University, who visited Columbia University in the course of collaborating with his thesis advisor on the Galactic bulge typically found in spiral galaxies.\n\nTyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the University of Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Hayden Planetarium.\n\nIn 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996. As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said \"when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me\".\n\nTyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the \"Universe\" column for \"Natural History\" magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called \"City of Stars\", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term \"Manhattanhenge\" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the street grid in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the Stonehenge monument in England. Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with The Great Courses.\n\nIn 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and in 2004 to serve on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, the latter better known as the \"Moon, Mars, and Beyond\" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.\nIn 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part \"Origins\" miniseries of the PBS \"Nova\" series, and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, \"Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution\". He again collaborated with Goldsmith as the narrator on the documentary \"400 Years of the Telescope\", which premiered on PBS in April 2009.\n\nAs director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep Pluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on \"The Colbert Report\", \"The Daily Show\", and \"BBC Horizon\" that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the dwarf planet classification.\n\nTyson recounted the heated online debate on the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet), a \"widely read, UK-based Internet chat group\", following Benny Peiser's renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status. Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and \"The Boston Globe\", spawned from \"The New York Times\"s article entitled \"Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York\".\n\nTyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the Planetary Society. He was also the host of the PBS program \"Nova ScienceNow\" until 2011. He attended and was a speaker at the symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on The History Channel's popular series \"The Universe\".\nIn May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called \"StarTalk\", which he co-hosted with comedian Lynne Koplitz. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on KTLK AM in Los Angeles and WHFS in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians Chuck Nice and Leighann Lord instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as GZA, Wil Wheaton, Sarah Silverman, and Bill Maher. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a podcast.\n\nIn April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and James Randi delivered a lecture entitled \"Skepticism\", which related directly with the convention's theme of \"The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise\".\n\nIn 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show \"StarTalk\". A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the Nerdist YouTube Channel. On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the White House Student Film Festival.\n\nIn 2014, Tyson helped revive Carl Sagan's \"\" television series, presenting \"\" on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel. Thirteen episodes were aired in the first season, and Tyson has stated that if a second season were produced, he would pass the role of host to someone else in the science world. In early January, 2018, it was announced that a second season of \"Cosmos\" was in production, and that Tyson would once again act as host.\n\nOn April 20, 2015, Tyson began hosting a late-night talk show entitled \"StarTalk\" on the National Geographic Channel, where Tyson interviews pop culture celebrities and asks them about their life experiences with science.\n\nTyson is co-developing a sandbox video game with Whatnot Entertainment, \"\", which aims to help provide players with a realistic simulation of developing a space-faring culture, incorporating educational materials about space and technology. The game was anticipated for release in 2018.\n\nTyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays \"The Perimeter of Ignorance\" and \"Holy Wars\", both appearing in \"Natural History\" magazine and the 2006 \"Beyond Belief\" workshop. In an interview with comedian Paul Mecurio, Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: \"For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe.\" Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in intelligent design limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.\n\nWhen asked during a question session at the University at Buffalo if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: \"Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.\" In an interview with \"Big Think\", Tyson said, \"So, what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be 'agnostic' ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all.\" Additionally, in the same interview with \"Big Think\", Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:I'm constantly \"claimed\" by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist.\" I said, \"Well that's not really true.\" I said, \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic.\" I went back a week later, it said \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist\" again – within a week! – and I said, \"What's up with that?\" and I said \"Alright, I have to word it a little differently.\" So I said, okay \"Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic.\"During the interview \"Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson\" in 2009, Tyson said: \"I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care.\"\n\nIn March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent Massimo Pigliucci asked Tyson \"What is it you think about God?\" Tyson replied \"I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe.\" Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label \"atheist\" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying \"That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist'.\" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist Richard Dawkins: \"[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not.\" Tyson replied: \"I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there.\"\n\nTyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of \"The Nerdist Podcast\", he stated that philosophy is \"useless\" and that a philosophy major \"can really mess you up\", which was met with disapproval. The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci later criticized him for \"dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise\".\n\nIn an undated interview at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a plasma burst from the sun on a local Fox affiliate in 1989. \"I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine.\"\n\nIn 2005, at a conference at the National Academy of Sciences, Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was \"...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society\". He continued: \"My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with \"Grantland\", Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. \"I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level.\" In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, \"[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message.\" He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. \"I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview.\"\n\nTyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Arguing that \"the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing\". Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, \"By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny.\"\n\nIn March 2012, Tyson testified before the United States Senate Science Committee, stating that:\n\nRight now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.\n\nInspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, Penny4NASA, a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit, was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the federal budget.\n\nIn his book \"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier\" Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting humans to Mars, will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the United States federal government.\n\nAs a science communicator, Tyson regularly appears on television, radio, and various other media outlets. He has been a regular guest on \"The Colbert Report\", and host Stephen Colbert refers to him in his comedic book \"I Am America (And So Can You!)\", noting in his chapter on scientists that most scientists are \"decent, well-intentioned people\", but, presumably tongue-in-cheek, that \"Neil DeGrasse Tyson is an absolute monster.\" He has appeared numerous times on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". He has made appearances on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", and \"The Rachel Maddow Show\". He served as one of the central interviewees on the various episodes of the History Channel science program, \"The Universe\". Tyson participated on the NPR radio quiz program \"Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!\" in 2007 and 2015. He has appeared several times on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", and he was also featured on an episode of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" as the ask-the-expert lifeline. He has spoken numerous times on the Philadelphia morning show, \"Preston and Steve\", on 93.3 WMMR, as well as on SiriusXM's \"Ron and Fez\" and \"The Opie and Anthony Show\".\n\nTyson has been featured as a guest interviewee on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\", \"Radiolab\", \"Skepticality\", and \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcasts and has been in several of the Symphony of Science videos.\n\nTyson lived near the World Trade Center and was an eyewitness to the September 11, 2001 attacks. He wrote a widely circulated letter on what he saw. Footage he filmed on the day was included in the 2008 documentary film \"102 Minutes That Changed America\".\n\nIn 2007, Tyson was the keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony of Deerfield Academy's new science center, the Koch Center, named for David H. Koch '59. He emphasized the impact science will have on the twenty-first century, as well as explaining that investments into science may be costly, but their returns in the form of knowledge gained and piquing interest is invaluable. Tyson has also appeared as the keynote speaker at The Amazing Meeting, a science and skepticism conference hosted by the James Randi Educational Foundation.\n\nTyson made a guest appearance as a version of himself in the episode \"Brain Storm\" of \"Stargate Atlantis\" alongside Bill Nye and in the episode \"The Apology Insufficiency\" of \"The Big Bang Theory\". Archive footage of him is used in the film \"Europa Report\". Tyson also made an appearance in an episode of \"Martha Speaks\" as himself.\nIn a May 2011 \"StarTalk Radio\" show, \"The Political Science of the Daily Show\", Tyson said he donates all income earned as a guest speaker.\n\nTyson is a frequent participant in the website Reddit's AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) where he is responsible for three of the top ten most popular AMAs of all time.\n\nIn \"Action Comics\" #14 (January 2013), which was published November 7, 2012, Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 lightyears from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked Corvus, which is Latin for \"Crow\", and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows. Tyson also had a minor appearance as himself in the 2016 film \"\".\n\nIn May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Neil deGrasse Tyson was listed by at least two commentators as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass. On March 8, 2014, Tyson made a SXSW Interactive keynote presentation at the Austin Convention Center.\n\nOn June 3, 2014, Tyson co-reviewed \"Gravity\" in a CinemaSins episode. He made two more appearances with CinemaSins, co-reviewing \"Interstellar\" on September 29, 2015, and \"The Martian\" on March 31, 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Tyson narrated and was a script supervisor for the science documentary, Food Evolution, directed by Academy Award nominated director Scott Hamilton Kennedy. In the same year, Tyson made a guest appearance on the Avenged Sevenfold album \"The Stage\", where he delivered a monolog on the track \"Exist\". In 2017, Tyson appeared on Logic's album \"Everybody\" as God, uncredited on various tracks, and credited on the song \"AfricAryaN\" as well as on \"The Moon\" on Musiq Soulchild's album \"Feel the Real\".\n\nIn 2018, Tyson made a guest appearance on \"The Big Bang Theory\" as himself, together with fellow scientist Bill Nye, in the first episode of the show's final season (\"The Conjugal Configuration\").\nTyson lives in the Tribeca neighborhood of Lower Manhattan with his wife, Alice Young. They have two children: Miranda and Travis. Tyson met his wife in a physics class at the University of Texas at Austin. They married in 1988 and named their first child Miranda, after the smallest of Uranus' five major moons. Tyson is a wine enthusiast whose collection was featured in the May 2000 issue of the \"Wine Spectator\" and the Spring 2005 issue of \"The World of Fine Wine\".\n\nDuring November and December 2018, accusations of sexual misconduct were raised against Tyson by four women. Thchiya Amet El Maat accused Tyson of drugging and raping her while both were graduate students at UT Austin in 1984. Katelyn Allers, a professor at Bucknell University, alleged Tyson touched her inappropriately at a 2009 American Astronomical Society gathering. She had a tattoo of the solar system which went from her arm to collar bone and said he was looking for Pluto. Ashley Watson, Tyson's assistant on \"Cosmos\", alleged Tyson made inappropriate sexual advances on her in 2018 which led her to resign from the position days later. In what Tyson described as a Native American handshake, he held her hand and looked her in the eye for ten seconds. When she left, he told her he wanted to hug her but would rather not in case he wanted more. A fourth anonymous woman alleged Tyson made inappropriate comments to her during a 2010 holiday party at the American Museum of Natural History. Tyson denied El Maat's rape accusation, while corroborating the basic facts around the situation of Allers and Watson's assertions, but claimed his actions were misinterpreted and apologized for any misunderstanding or offense.\n\nFox, National Geographic, the Museum of Natural History, and the producers of \"Cosmos\" announced investigations, which Tyson stated that he welcomed. The National Geographic Channel announced on January 3, 2019, that they were putting further episodes of \"StarTalk\" on hiatus as \"to allow the investigation to occur unimpeded\". The premiere of \"Cosmos: Possible Worlds\", initially scheduled for March 3, 2019, was also delayed while the investigation continued. On March 15, 2019, both National Geographic and Fox announced that \"The investigation is complete, and we are moving forward with both \"StarTalk\" and \"Cosmos\",\" and that \"There will be no further comment.\" The networks affirmed that both \"StarTalk\" and \"Cosmos\" would resume, but that no date had been set. In July, the American Museum of Natural History stated Neil deGrasse Tyson would keep his job as director of the Hayden Planetarium.\n\nList of awards received by Tyson:\n\n\n\n\nList of works by Tyson:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972780", "title": "Headhunter (video game)", "text": "Headhunter (video game)\n\nHeadhunter is an action-adventure video game developed by Amuze and published by Sega for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2.\n\nAccording to John Kroknes, creative director at Amuze, the game was strongly influenced by 1980s action movies and Paul Verhoeven's science fiction films.\n\nFor the majority of the game, the gameplay is that of a third-person shooter as players control protagonist Jack Wade. Jack travels between the main levels of the game on his motorcycle, and these sections take the form of a racing game, with the motorbike's acceleration and braking controlled using the sensitive analogue trigger buttons of the Dreamcast control pad.\n\nA sequel was released in 2004 called \"Headhunter Redemption\" and it was released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.\n\nThe game takes place in the near future in a city similar to Los Angeles, California. Criminals are punished for their crimes not only by serving time in prison but by having their internal organs surgically removed (if they lost to another prisoner in an underwater arena) and transplanted to benefit the wealthier members of society. Officially responsible for law enforcement are the Anti-Crime Network (ACN) organisation and their employees, the bounty hunter-like Headhunters. In order to prevent damage occurring to the criminals' organs as they are apprehended, conventional firearms have been banned, replaced by Electric Neural Projectile (ENP) guns that fire special bullets which do not damage flesh but instead emit an electrical charge that causes severe pain in victims, paralyses muscles and eventually kills the brain. According to the game, ENP technology was developed by Biotech and the main manufacturer of ENP handguns is Smith & Easton (a reference to the firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson), although the technology can also be used with grenades, proximity mines, rocket launchers and other explosives.\n\nThe game begins with Jack escaping from a secret laboratory, but soon after going outside he faints and falls unconscious. He wakes up in hospital and learns that he is suffering from amnesia and that although he was once the very best Headhunter, his license has now been revoked. In order to investigate the murder of ACN founder Christopher Stern, he must re-earn his Headhunter licence by taking part in virtual-reality tests (called LEILA tests) and capture some of the most dangerous criminals in the city. Throughout the game, Jack is aided by Christopher Stern's daughter Angela and his old boss Chief Hawke; although he also finds that his main rival to the title of best Headhunter is the unpleasant Hank Redwood.\n\nThe game's storyline progresses through standard FMV cutscenes, propaganda commercials and satirical news broadcasts (presented by the fictional Bill Waverley and Kate Gloss).\n\nThe Dreamcast version received \"generally favourable reviews\", while the PlayStation 2 version received \"average\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe Dreamcast version received a highly favourable review from \"Eurogamer\"s Tom Bramwell. He noted that it had been compared to \"Metal Gear Solid\", but considered the setting and story to be superior in Headhunter. The game was described as \"a masterpiece of modern videogame development\".\n"}

The film stars Venkatesh, Sridevi and Paresh Rawal in the lead roles. The sound track and background score composed by M. M. Keeravani received rave reviews. The film is one of the highest rated Telugu films on the Internet Movie Database. The narrative by Ram Gopal Varma, and the cinematography by Teja and S. Gopala Reddy, received positive reviews.\n\n\"Kshana Kshanam\" won four state Nandi Awards, including Best Direction, Best Screenplay, and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu to Sridevi for essaying the victim of circumstance. Varma adapted \"Kshana Kshanam\" into \"Daud\" for pan-Indian audiences, and produced caper films such as \"Thiruda Thiruda,\" \"Anaganaga Oka Roju\" and \"Road\".\n\nNarayana (Horse Babu) and his accomplice, working for Nayar (Paresh Rawal), break into a bank in Hyderabad and steal INR 1,00,00,000. Found out by the police, the group engages in a shootout and later a chase, during which one of the gang members and the policemen are killed. Narayana, going rogue, kills his accomplice and betrays Narsing (Narsing Yadav), hoping to keep the loot for himself. With the police watching all routes out of Hyderabad, Nayar and his men track Narayana to his brother's photo studio. Before he his caught, Narayana hides the clue to where he hid the money in one of the photo envelopes.\n\nCaught and tortured, Narayana reveals the clue, but before they can retrieve it, the envelope is taken by Satya (Sridevi), a middle-class working girl. Before dying, Narayana reveals the truth and the clue to his brother. Heading home, Satya is accosted by one of Nayar's men, who demands the envelope. Trying to escape, Satya accidentally stabs him, after which her nosy neighbor calls the police on her. While on the phone, the thug gets up again, only to fall down dead, a knife lodged in his back, which later is shown as being thrown by Narayan's brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Chandu (Venkatesh) is a small time thief posing as a police officer to con and steal from people. While relaxing at a dhaba, Satya enters the place and calls her friend to inform her about what happened, unaware that the police were listening in. Chandu inadvertently saves her from being assaulted by a gang of hoodlums, and while she is thanking him, the police arrive. Thinking that they are after him, Chandu takes Satya hostage and escapes into the jungle with her. Meanwhile, Nayar and his men also join the pursuit.\n\nChandu and Satya face a few challenges in avoiding the police, Narayana's brother and Nayar in the forest, gradually growing closer to each other. They run into Nayar, where he demands to know where the envelope is. Escaping the police led by Inspector Yadav (Rami Reddy) and Narayana's brother, Chandu deduces that the clue to the money is hidden in that envelope. They eventually stumble across Nayar's truck, which they use to escape the jungle and into the city. Knowing that Satya's apartment is a crime scene and will be guarded, Chandu and Satya decide to scale the building from outside through her neighbour's apartment. They eventually find the envelope, which contains a storage receipt for the cloak room at the railway station. Evading Nayar's henchmen and the police, Chandu and Satya face off against one of Nayar's henchmen at Chandu's apartment and tie him up. While Chandu goes off to meet his friend and decide what to do with the money they found, Satya is left to guard the henchman, who breaks free and subdues her, then calls Nayar.\n\nMeanwhile, Chandu decides to keep half the money and return the rest but is ambushed by Nayar's henchmen and brought to his apartment, where he is forced to hand over the receipt. However, the police are tipped off to their location by a police informant, and a shootout ensues. Chandu manages to subdue Nayar and get the receipt, and they head for the station with Nayar and the police in pursuit. The duo reaches the station and retrieves the money bag. They then climb the train to escape Nayar. At the next station, Nayar and his men board the train, leading to a fight between Chandu and the goons. Left with Nayar and one of his men, Nayar holds Chandu and Satya at gunpoint, demanding the money. In response, Chandu hangs the bag over the side, threatening to drop if he shoots. Left with no options, Nayar decides to have the train stopped so that he can shoot them and retrieve the money, only for his henchman and the train driver to struggle and fall out of the train. Chandu unhooks the engine from the rest of the train, jumping back to grab the bag and jump off. With the engine out of control, it plows through a number of houses before finally ramming a wall and slowing down.\n\nNayar is arrested by the police, and Chandu returns the money to Yadav, after being forced to do so by Satya. The film ends with Satya asking Chandru to drop her home, offering to introduce him to her mother, and an amused Chandu agreeing.\n\nBijon Das Gupta was the production designer for the film. Filming was done in Hyderabad, Nallamala forests, and Mudumalai National Park. Sridevi's acclaimed performance of an innocent girl stuck in a tight spot, won her awards. She also sang the soundtrack \"Kingu La Kanipisthunnadu\" which was shot in The Leela Mumbai.\n\nMusic composed by M. M. Keeravani. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972785", "title": "Illinois (Sufjan Stevens album)", "text": "Illinois (Sufjan Stevens album)\n\nIllinois (styled Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel the ILLINOISE on the cover; sometimes written as Illinoise) is a 2005 concept album by American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens. His fifth studio album, it features songs referencing places, events, and persons related to the U.S. state of Illinois. \"Illinois\" is Stevens' second based on a U.S. state—part of a planned series of fifty that began with the 2003 album \"Michigan\" and that Stevens has since acknowledged was a joke.\n\nStevens recorded and produced the album at multiple venues in New York City using low fidelity studio equipment and a variety of instruments between late 2004 and early 2005. The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state—Stevens developed them after analyzing criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following its release, Stevens promoted \"Illinois\" with a world tour.\n\nCritics praised the album for its well-written lyrics and complex orchestrations. In particular, reviewers noted Stevens' progress as a songwriter since the release of \"Michigan\". \"Illinois\" was named the best-reviewed album of 2005 by review aggregator Metacritic, and was included on several reviewers' \"best of the decade\" lists—including those of \"Paste\", NPR, and \"Rolling Stone\". The album amounted to Stevens' greatest public success to date; it was his first to place on the \"Billboard\" 200, and it topped the \"Billboard\" list of \"Heatseekers Albums\". The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by Steve Reich, Neil Young, and the Cure. Besides numerous references to Illinois, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith.\n\nStevens launched his 50-state project in 2003 with the album \"Michigan\" and chose to focus on Illinois with this recording because \"it wasn't a great leap\", and he liked the state because he considered it the \"center of gravity\" for the American Midwest. Before creating the album, Stevens read literature by Illinois authors Saul Bellow and Carl Sandburg, and studied immigration records and history books for the state—he made the deliberate decision to avoid current events and focused on historical themes. He also took trips through several locations in Illinois and asked friends and members of Internet chat rooms for anecdotes about their experiences in the state. Although he began work in 2004 on Oregon-themed songs and briefly considered releasing a Rhode Island 7\", Stevens has since not released another album focused on a state, saying in a November 2009 interview with \"Paste\" that \"the whole premise was such a joke,\" and telling Andrew Purcell of \"The Guardian\" in October 2009 \"I have no qualms about admitting [the fifty states project] was a promotional gimmick.\" An Arkansas-related song was released through NPR as \"The Lord God Bird\" and material intended for New Jersey and New York became \"The BQE\".\n\nAll of the songs on \"Illinois\" were written, recorded, engineered, and produced by Stevens, with most of the material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens' Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: \"I was pretty nearsighted in the construction of \"Illinois\". I spent a lot of time alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I let things germinate and cultivate independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all.\"\n\nStevens employed low-fidelity recording equipment, which allowed him to retain creative control and keep costs low on recording \"Illinois\". Typically, his process involved recording to 32 kHz 8-track tape using inexpensive microphones such as the Shure SM57 and AKG C1000. He then employed Pro Tools for mixing and other production tasks.\n\nAfter consulting with Michael Kaufmann and Lowell Brams of Asthmatic Kitty about the amount of material he had recorded, Stevens decided against a double album, saying that would be \"arrogant\". In 2006, several tracks recorded during these sessions were sent to Seattle-based musician and producer James McAllister for additional instrumentation and production, and were released in 2006 on the follow-up album \"\". Among these outtakes are three separate recordings of the song \"Chicago\"—including the \"Multiple Personality Disorder Version\", which was produced during a subsequent tour. The \"Adult Contemporary Easy Listening Version\" of the song was supposed to appear on the \"Illinois\" album, but was changed at the last minute.\n\n\"Illinois\" was released on July 4, 2005, through Rough Trade Records in Europe and was distributed domestically by Asthmatic Kitty Records starting July 5, 2005. Although he initially had no plans to perform this material live, less than two weeks after the release of \"Illinois\", Stevens embarked on a North American tour to promote the album, performing with a string section of eight to ten members named the Illinoisemakers. He deliberately chose to avoid television as a promotional tool and focused on the tour performances themselves. He was supported on some dates by opening acts Liz Janes (who is also signed to Asthmatic Kitty) and Laura Veirs as well as \"Illinois\" collaborator Shara Nova's solo project My Brightest Diamond. He toured in support of the album again from September through November 2006, this time including dates in several European cities. During the 2006 dates, Stevens and his band transitioned from wearing University of Illinois-themed outfits to butterfly suits and bird wings.\n\nReviewers have noted similarities between this album and those of musicians and composers in several musical genres—from pop to contemporary classical, even show tunes and jazz-based time signatures. The lyrics and their rich thematic elements have been noted for their literary quality, earning comparisons to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Carlos Williams, and Walt Whitman. Genre labels that have been applied to the album include indie folk, indie pop, baroque pop, indie rock, folk rock, , chamber folk, and lo-fi.\n\nReviewers of \"Illinois\" have compared Stevens' style to Steve Reich, Vince Guaraldi, the Danielson Famile, Neil Young, Nick Drake, and Death Cab for Cutie. Stevens' use of large orchestral arrangements in his music—much of it played by himself through the use of multi-track recording—has been noted by several reviewers. \"Rolling Stone\" summarized the musical influences of \"Illinois\", saying \"the music draws from high school marching bands, show tunes and ambient electronics; we can suspect Steve Reich's \"Music for 18 Musicians\" is an oft-played record in the Stevens household, since he loves to echo it in his long instrumental passages.\" A review in \"The A.V. Club\" referred to some of the vocal work as \"regressively twee communalism\", but found Stevens' music overall to be \"highly developed\". The song \"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\" has a saxophone part resembling \"Close to Me\" by The Cure.\n\nThe creation of \"Illinois\" marked a shift in Stevens' emphasis on songwriting and studio work toward live performance and more abstract concepts of motion and sound—subsequent tours and albums emphasized electronic music and modern dance over the indie folk material on \"Michigan\" and \"Illinois\". He has ceased writing songs about individual characters with straightforward narratives or concept albums and briefly considered quitting the music business entirely after creating and promoting this album. He also found that the way in which he listened to music had changed after producing \"Illinois\":\n\nStevens is a classically trained oboist and his knowledge of classical and baroque music influenced many of his arrangements. Stevens himself has noted the influence of composers Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Edvard Grieg; along with contemporary composers Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass. The music on this album was written to be grandiose, to match the history of the territory. Stevens used time signature changes in the composition of \"Illinois\" for dynamic effect—for instance, \"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\" begins with a 5/4 time signature and then changes to a standard 4/4 later in the song.\n\nMany of the lyrics in \"Illinois\" make references to persons, places, and events related to the state of the same name. \"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois\" is about a UFO sighting by police officers near Highland, Illinois, where several persons reported seeing a large triangular object with three lights flying at night. \"Come on! Feel the Illinoise!\" makes reference to the World's Columbian Exposition, which took place in Chicago in 1893.\n\n\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\" documents the story of the 1970s Chicago-based serial killer of the same name. Several lyrics make explicit references to events in his life: \"[w]hen the swingset hit his head\" refers to an event in Gacy's childhood, when a swing hit his head and caused a blood clot in his brain; \"He dressed up like a clown for them / with his face paint white and red\" alludes to the nickname given to Gacy—the \"Killer Clown\"; and \"He put a cloth on their lips / Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth\" references Gacy's use of chloroform to subdue and molest his victims. The song ends with the narrator turning inward with the lyrics: \"And in my best behavior, I am really just like him / Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid.\" Stevens stated in a 2009 interview with \"Paste\" that \"we're all capable of what [Gacy] did.\"\n\n\"Casimir Pulaski Day\" interweaves a personal story with the state holiday Casimir Pulaski Day. \"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\" makes references to Superman, whose fictional hometown of Metropolis was partially modeled after Chicago (the town of Metropolis, Illinois has also capitalized on this association). Jessica Hopper of the \"Chicago Reader\" noted that Ray Middleton—who was the first actor to play the comic book superhero—was also born in Chicago. \"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!\" makes references to ghost towns of Illinois. Stevens relates experiences from a summer camp he went to as a child in Michigan for \"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!\", but moved the locale to Illinois for the sake of the album. The track \"Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!\" includes references to Decatur, Illinois, but Stevens stated the track also acted as \"an exercise in rhyme schemes\". Some references to Decatur included in the song were alligator sightings in the area, the equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, and a flood that exhumed a graveyard of soldiers from the Civil War.\n\nOther allusions to the state's people, places, and events include the Black Hawk War, author Carl Sandburg, Stephen A. Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, the Sangamon River, the Chicago Cubs, the Sears Tower dubbed \"Seer's Tower\" (now called Willis Tower), and the localities of Jacksonville, Peoria, Metropolis, Savanna, Caledonia, Secor, Magnolia, Kankakee, Evansville, and the several locations named Centerville, Illinois. During the tour following the release of \"Illinois\", Stevens' band wore cheerleader outfits based on those of the University of Illinois.\n\nAlthough \"Illinois\" is a concept album about the U.S. state, Stevens also explored themes related to Christianity and the Bible. As a Christian, he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career—particularly on the 2004 album \"Seven Swans\"—and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements. The song \"Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!\" includes the line \"It's the great I Am\"—taken from the response God gave when Moses asked for his name in the Book of Exodus (). \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" describes the death of a romantic partner due to bone cancer, and the narrator questions God in the process. More abstract allusions appear in \"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\", which utilizes Superman as a Christ figure and \"The Seer's Tower\", which references the Book of Revelation and the Second Coming of Christ. Songs which were not written with an explicit theological focus—such as \"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\"—also feature religious themes such as sin and redemption.\n\nDivya Srinivasan created the album artwork, depicting a variety of Illinois-related themes, including Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, the Sears Tower, and Black Hawk. The album cover reads, \"Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel the Illinoise!\" as a wordplay on the common mispronunciation of the state's name as \"ill-i-NOYZ\" and a reference to the Slade song \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" made famous in the United States by the metal band Quiet Riot. The text on the cover caused some confusion over the actual title of the album—it is officially titled \"Illinois\", as opposed to \"Come on Feel the Illinoise\" or \"Illinoise\". \"Paste\" listed \"Illinois\" as having the seventh best album art of the decade 2000–2009. The album also won the PLUG Independent Music Award for Album Art/Packaging of the Year in 2006.\n\nShortly after the release of the album, reports arose that DC Comics had issued a cease and desist letter to Asthmatic Kitty because of the depiction of Superman on the cover. However, on October 4, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty announced that there had been no cease and desist letter; the record company's own lawyers had warned about the copyright infringement. On June 30, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty's distributor Secretly Canadian asked its retailers not to sell the album; however, it was not recalled. On July 5, the distributor told its retailers to go ahead and sell their copies, as DC Comics agreed to allow Asthmatic Kitty to sell the copies of the album that were already manufactured, but the image was removed from subsequent pressings. Soon after it was made public that the cover would be changed, copies of the album featuring Superman were sold for as high as $75 on eBay. On the vinyl edition released on November 22, 2005, Superman's image is covered by a balloon sticker. The image of the balloon sticker was also used on the cover of the compact disc and later printings of the double vinyl release. Stevens himself was surprised by the development and also had to pay a fee for referencing lyrics from Woody Guthrie's folk anthem \"This Land Is Your Land\" in the track \"No Man's Land\", which was later released on \"The Avalanche\".\n\nThe 10th anniversary vinyl reissue of \"Illinois\" features the Marvel character Blue Marvel, who hails from Chicago, in place of Superman. Asthmatic Kitty obtained permission from Marvel to use the character's likeness. The Blue Marvel edition's artwork was created by Divya Srinivasan and is pressed on blue vinyl.\n\n\"Illinois\" was Sufjan Stevens' greatest commercial and critical success to date. For the first time, his work charted on the \"Billboard\" 200 and received several awards from critics.\n\nJesse Jarnow of \"Paste\" praised the playful nature of \"Illinois\", commenting that it had \"sing-song\" melodies and \"jaunty\" orchestrations. Jarnow also noted ironic lyrics, citing a line from \"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!\": \"I can't explain the state I'm in ...\" after a section of the song that references many Illinois landmarks. \"Q\" called the album a \"sizeable step forward\" from \"Michigan\", and said Stevens' love for the state of Illinois is infectious. Critic Andy Gill dubbed \"Illinois\" \"an extraordinary achievement\" in \"Uncut\", and in a separate review for \"The Independent\" added that it \"makes most other albums seem small-minded and, ironically, rather parochial.\" Catherine Lewis of \"The Washington Post\" responded favorably to the album, stating that it has well-written lyrics, comparing Stevens' rhyming to that of Stephin Merritt. Lewis cited \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" as one of the most memorable songs of the album.\n\n\"Illinois\" achieved recognition with inclusion on numerous reviewers' \"best of the year\" and \"best of the decade\" lists. In particular, the album topped the best of the decade list appearing in the November 2009 issue of \"Paste\" and NPR named \"Illinois\" on their list of \"The Decade's 50 Most Important Recordings\". \"Pitchfork\" called \"Illinois\" the sixteenth best album of the decade, with Stevens' previous album—\"Michigan\"—placing 70 on that same list. The album also won the 2005 New Pantheon Award—a type of Shortlist Music Prize. The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". Finally, \"Paste\" listed Stevens as one of their \"100 Best Living Songwriters\" in 2006, primarily due to the writing on \"Michigan\" and \"Illinois\".\n\nIn its first week of sales, \"Illinois\" sold 9,000 copies, 20% coming from online sales. Overall, the album sold more than 100,000 copies by November 2005 and over 300,000 by the end of 2009. It was Stevens' first release to place on the \"Billboard\" 200, reaching number 121 within eight weeks on the chart. It also reached number one on \"Billboard\"s Heatseekers Albums chart and number four on the Independent Albums chart, remaining on them for 32 and 39 weeks, respectively. In August 2017, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States.\n\nIn July 2013, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for 60,000 sold units in the United Kingdom.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n"}

The palace separates Piazza delle Erbe from Piazza dei Frutti, where there is a fruit and vegetable market.\n\nThe building, with its great hall on the upper floor, is believed to be one of the largest medieval halls still extant; the hall is nearly rectangular, its length 81.5m, its breadth 27m, and its height 24 m; the walls are covered with allegorical frescoes; the building stands on arches, and the upper storey is surrounded by an open loggia, not unlike that which surrounds the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. \n\nThe Palazzo was begun in 1172 and finished in 1219. In 1306, Fra Giovanni, an Augustinian friar, covered the whole with one roof; originally there were three roofs, spanning the three chambers into which the hall was at first divided; the internal partition walls remained until the fire of 1420, when the Venetian architects who undertook the restoration removed them, throwing all three spaces into one and forming the present great hall, the Salone. The new space was refrescoed by Nicolò Miretto and Stefano da Ferrara, working from 1425 to 1440. Some of the frescoes depict the astrological theories of Pietro d'Abano, a professor at Padua University in the 13th century.The gigantic wooden horse on the western side of the hall was built in 1466 and is modelled on Donatello's \"Equestrian statue of Gattamelata\" which is in place on Piazza del Santo. On the eastern side there is a contemporary version of a Foucault pendulum.\n\nA tornado destroyed the roof and damaged the building on 17 August 1756.\n"}

It has a partner school in Aliso Veijo, California, and supports educational projects in India, Zambia, Cambodia, Ethiopia as well as local projects. In addition, the school is part of a range of international school organizations and networks. The school is the largest and oldest international curriculum school in Milan and sends graduates to universities in the UK, US, Italy and all over the world. The current Headmaster of the school is Stephen Rogers who joined from the English International School, Prague in 2017.\n\nFounded in 1958, the school initially offered the British O Levels/GCSE and A Levels. The International Baccalaureate was gradually adopted as the main curriculum after the Italian government recognized the IB as equivalent to the \"Maturità\" (the Italian equivalent of A Levels) during the late 1980s to early 1990s. The British curriculum is no longer taught and ISM is solely an IB World School.\n\nIn September 2013, the school opened a brand-new purpose-built campus in Baranzate, northern Milan which united the Primary, Middle and High School sections of the school.\n\nThe network was founded in 2008. ISM, as well as its sister schools in Monza (1984), Rome (1988) and Modena (1998), are part of the network.

{"id": "1972800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972800", "title": "Meletus", "text": "Meletus\n\nMeletus (; fl. 5th–4th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian Greek from the Pithus deme known for his prosecuting role in the trial and eventual execution of the philosopher Socrates.\n\nLittle is known of Meletus' life beyond what is portrayed in the Socratic literature, particularly Plato's dialogues, where he is named as the chief accuser of Socrates. In the \"Euthyphro\", Plato describes Meletus as the youngest of the three prosecutors, having \"a beak, and long straight hair, and a beard which is ill grown,\" and being unknown to Socrates prior to the prosecution. Meletus is also mentioned briefly in the \"Theaetetus\". \n\nThe later Greek historian Diogenes Laërtius dubiously reported that after the execution of Socrates \"Athenians felt such remorse\" that they executed Meletus and banished his associates from the city. He also argues that it was Antisthenes, the disciple of Socrates and founder of Cynicism, who was largely thought responsible for the execution of Meletus.\n\nDuring the first three hours of trial, Meletus and the other two accusers each stood in the law court in the center of Athens to deliver previously crafted speeches to the jury against Socrates. No record of Meletus' speech survives. However, within the \"Apology\" we do have Plato's record of Socrates' cross-examination of Meletus, per the Athenian legal convention allowing the defendant to cross-examine the accuser. Using his characteristic Socratic method, Socrates makes Meletus to seem an inarticulate fool. He says that Socrates corrupts the young, and that Socrates is the only one to do so, but he can not provide a motive for why Socrates would do this. Socrates shows that if he were to do this it must surely be in ignorance, for no good man would intentionally make bad those living around him. Concerning the accusation that Socrates believed in strange spirits and not the gods of the state, Socrates shows that Meletus is saying that spirits are the offspring of gods, and since no one believes in flutes playing without flute players, or in horses' offspring without horses, Socrates could not believe in the offspring of gods without believing in gods.\n\n"}

Salmon Creek flows through the town.\n\nThe town of Bodega was known historically as Bodega Corners or Bodega Roads, to distinguish it from the Port of Bodega or Bodega Bay, as it is known today, which is about four miles from Bodega. Bodega and Bodega Bay are named for discoverer of the bay, Juan Francisco Bodega y Caudra, who first sailed into the harbor in 1775. There were formerly two Coast Miwok villages in the area: one (called \"Kennekono\") sited near the current town and another (called \"Suwutenne\") further north. The first Europeans in the area were Russians who established temporary settlements at Bodega Bay and the Salmon Creek Valley, in the vicinity of Bodega, in 1809.\n\nIn 1843, Captain Stephen Smith established the first West Coast lumber mill near Bodega. Around the same time, John A. Sutter bought land from the Russians, an area that included Bodega. His land purchase included \"some hunting rights, a small boat, several rusty cannons, and some old muskets.\" In 1859, shipbuilders constructed Saint Teresa of Avila Church.

He was a member of the Canadian Red Cross Society, as well as the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, eventually serving as the chairman of the Board of Governors of the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. He was also involved with the Canadian Bar Association, and served a one-year term as the national president of the CBA. He was also Honorary Colonel of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada.\n\nMacAulay was born in Morden, Manitoba, one of the seven children of Finlay MacAulay (1842-1918) and Margaret MacDonald (1860-1930). He obtained his LL.B. from the University of Manitoba in 1918 while serving in the Canadian Medical Corps.\n\nUpon being called to the bar, MacAulay joined the Winnipeg law firm of Aikins, MacAulay & Thorvaldson. He eventually became partner in the firm, specializing in tax law. In 1931, his status in the profession was recognized by his appointment as King's Counsel by the Manitoba government.\n\nMacAulay was also a businessman. He was a vice-president and director of the Bank of Montreal, and is credited with bringing the Safeway grocery chain to Canada. He was a vice-president of Safeway until his death.\n\nMacAulay was active in the Canadian Bar Association. In 1953-54, he served as national president of the CBA. He was the third lawyer from Aikins MacAulay & Thovaldson to serve as national president, the previous two being Sir James Aikins (1914-1927) and Gordon Harold Aikins (1942-1943). A fourth lawyer from Aikins MacAulay & Thorvaldson, A. Lorne Campbell, would also be president (1970-1971).\n\nMacAulay was a long-time volunteer with the Red Cross. During the Second World War, he was president of the Manitoba Red Cross, and from 1950 to 1951 he was president of the Canadian Red Cross Association.\n\nIn 1952, he chaired the 18th International Conference of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Toronto, when tensions over the Korean War threatened to shatter the international association. His diplomatic handling of the situation, and response to the positions of opposing factions within the association, helped to preserve the unity of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1965, he was chairman of the Board of Governors of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. During his tenure, the number of national societies rose from 88 to 106. He was chairman when the International Red Cross Committee and the League of Red Cross Societies received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1963.\n\nMacAulay was a member of Westminster United Church in Winnipeg. During the 1930s and 1940s, he taught one of the largest adult Bible classes in Canada.\n\nAn avid art collector, he was active with the Winnipeg Art Gallery (1950-1953) and the National Art Gallery of Canada (1955-1957). Part of his collection is now housed in the Winnipeg Art Gallery.\n\n"}

Also in the context of video games, “nuking” may also describe the act of using a nuclear weapon while playing the game, such as the atomic bomb in \"Call of Duty\" games.\n\nThe term is notably dissimilar in different genres.\n\nIn an MMORPG, nuking may differ in meaning between different communities. For example, to some individuals, to “nuke” is to deal the most possible damage to the most enemies possible (almost exclusively by means of an area of effect skill), whereas other individuals use the term by referring to the highest possible damage to a single target in the shortest amount of time, also known as a spike. Some individuals believe that the player, or players, nuking must do so by means of ranged combat (that is, out of melee range); others make no such distinction. It can also mean to critical hit often or just to deal high standard damage.\n\nIn a real-time or turn-based strategy game, the term \"nuke\" has one distinct use. It can describe the tactic of attacking an opponent's specific (often high-priority) units with high-damage spells in order to kill them or force (or strongly encourage) the opposing player to remove them from battle. Such usage is common in \"Warcraft III\", in which \"Heroes\" are frequently the targets and attackers due to their relative high priority and common faculty for high-damaging spells.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972856", "title": "Polly Berry", "text": "Polly Berry\n\nPolly Berry, also known as Polly Crockett and Polly Wash (b. c. 1818 – d. c. 1870–1880), was an enslaved African-American woman who on October 3, 1839 filed a freedom suit in St. Louis, Missouri, which she won in 1843 based on having been held illegally as a slave for an extended period of time in the free state of Illinois. In 1842 Berry sued for the freedom of her daughter Lucy Ann Berry, based on \"partus sequitur ventrem\" (the child is born into the status of the mother), which she won in 1844 in a case argued by Edward Bates, the future U.S. Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nPolly Berry's life is primarily known through her daughter's memoir, \"From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom\", the only first-person account of a freedom suit. The daughter published her slave narrative in 1891 under her married name of Lucy Delaney.\n\nIn the 1990s, the case files of these two suits were among more than 300 freedom suits discovered among nineteenth-century Circuit Court records in St. Louis. They provide some facts different from Delaney's account. The Missouri State Archives and Washington University have created a searchable online database of the freedom suit files containing images of the complete case files held by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis and the Missouri Historical Society.\n\nIn her 1839 case, Polly deposed that she was held as a child in slavery in Wayne County, Kentucky by Joseph Crockett. When she was about fourteen, he migrated west and took her with him to Illinois, where they stayed for several weeks, despite its being a free state. Illinois as a free state held that slaveholders who brought slaves into the state for extended periods forfeited their rights to their \"property,\" and the slaves became legally free. During that time, Crockett hired out Polly for domestic servant tasks, and she was known as Polly Crockett. Next he took her up the Missouri River for about five years.\n\nPolly was sold to a Major Taylor Berry in St. Louis, Missouri. She married one of his slaves, said to be a mulatto, and they had two daughters, Nancy and Lucy Ann Berry. (Much of this information came initially from Lucy Ann's memoir \"From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom\" (1891), whose version of her mother's life was that she was born free, kidnapped and sold into slavery.)\n\nFollowing the Major's death, his widow Fanny Berry married Robert Wash, one of three Missouri State Supreme Court justices. Fanny Wash died a few years later. Despite the provisions of Major Berry's will to free the slaves after his and his wife's deaths, Fanny's widower Robert Wash sold Polly's husband to a plantation in the Deep South. The Berry daughters reclaimed Polly Berry (also called Polly Wash at the time, in reference to her master's name) and her daughters from Wash.\n\nPolly Berry prepared her daughters for escape. While Nancy Berry was accompanying Mary Berry Coxe and her new husband on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls, New York, she fled successfully across the river by ferry to Canada, which had abolished slavery. There she first stayed with a friend of her mother's and settled in Toronto, where she married and had her own family in freedom.\n\nThe mother Polly Berry escaped in 1839, after being sold to Joseph M. Magehan, a lumberman, because of conflict with Mary Berry Coxe. She traveled as far as Chicago before being captured by slave catchers under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. They returned her to St. Louis and her master Magehan. She resolved to protect her daughter Lucy Ann, who was only 12 years old.\n\nOnce returned, Berry/Wash filed a freedom suit in the St. Louis Circuit Court on October 3, 1839, on the basis that, when younger, she had been illegally held as a slave in Illinois (\"Polly Wash v. Joseph M. Magehan\"). Her attorney was Harris Sprout. It was not until 1843 that her case was tried, but she successfully proved her case in court. While the case was pending, Wash was hired out as a laundress to earn money against her upkeep. Delaney's memoir suggests that Wash's attorneys proposed the strategy of filing separate suits for her and her daughter, to prevent a jury's worrying about taking too much property from one slaveholder.\n\nMartha Berry Mitchell, another of the married daughters of the late Major Berry, claimed the slave girl Lucy Ann Berry as a domestic servant. Angered over the girl's lack of skills with laundry, Mitchell got into a physical confrontation with her, which Lucy Ann resisted. Martha and her husband David D. Mitchell decided to sell the young slave downriver. (Mitchell was the US regional Superintendent for Indian Affairs.) Before being shipped away, Lucy Ann escaped to the house of a friend of her mother.\n\nPolly Berry (then known as Polly Wash) immediately filed suit on September 8, 1842 as a \"next friend\" of her daughter against David D. Mitchell. Because her own case had not yet been tried, as a slave she had no individual legal standing, but the law allowed her to file a suit on behalf of her minor daughter. According to the doctrine of \"partus sequitur ventrem\", which assigned the status of children according to that of the mother, since Lucy Ann was born to a woman considered free at the time in Illinois, she should also have been free. The young slave was remanded to jail, where she was held for 17 months rather than being hired out, as was customary. Wash's attorneys were successful in ensuring that Lucy Ann Berry was kept in St. Louis, but it appeared Mitchell enforced her imprisonment. Usually enslaved prisoners were hired out, with the wages given to the owner.\n\nOn June 6, 1843, Polly Wash was declared a free woman by an all-white jury, on the basis of witnesses who testified she had been held as a slave in Illinois, where the law ruled slaveholders' forfeited their rights to slaves if they stayed in the state. This precedent of \"once free, always free\" had been set in the 1824 Missouri case of \"Winny v. Whitesides\". Because Polly Wash had filed a separate case for her daughter, that case had to be heard.\n\nLucy Ann's case was not heard until February 7 and 8, 1844. Her attorneys argued that Lucy Berry's freedom was based on her birth to a woman who had been proven to be free based on having been held illegally in Illinois. Francis Butter Murdoch, the former district attorney for Alton, Illinois, prepared the case. (He had prosecuted the murder of Elijah Lovejoy in Alton by anti-abolitionists.)\n\nWash also gained the aid of the prominent Whig politician Edward Bates. Although a slaveholder, he argued the case in court. He was later appointed as the US Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. Murdoch handled numerous \"freedom suits\" in St. Louis. With Wash's case settled by the principle of \"once free, always free,\" Bates was able to convince the jury that her daughter Lucy Ann Berry should be considered free as well.\n\nAs the scholar Eric Gardner writes,\n\nTo Bates--as to the majority of the Missouri Supreme Court for several years--such a principle actually depended on recognizing and allowing legal slavery: if an individual African American was not \"once free\"--through birth to a free mother, residence, manumission, or other circumstances carefully specified in state law--then she or he had no legal right to demand freedom. This syllogism, of course, explains why Bates could be a slaveholder and still support Lucy [Berry] Delaney; this premise is why, he argues by extension, the jury could do the same.\n\nThe record of the decision said, \"it is therefore considered by the Court that said Plaintiff be liberated and entirely set free from the Defendant and from all persons claiming by, through, or under him by title derived since the commencement of this suit.\" Lucy Ann was 14 years old. Her and her mother's cases were two of 301 freedom suits filed in St. Louis Circuit Court from 1814-1860, for which records were discovered in the 1990s.\n\nWash filed a second suit on behalf of her daughter, for $1000 in damages against David D. Mitchell for false imprisonment. The information in the two case files does not entirely agree with the account in Lucy Delaney's autobiography. By this suit, Wash and Murdoch may have been trying to preclude Mitchell from appealing the court's decision, in addition to seeking reparations. They later dropped the suit without trial.\n\nPolly Berry lived with her daughter Lucy Ann for the rest of her life. At first they worked together as seamstresses. Polly Berry managed to visit her daughter Nancy and grandchildren in Toronto in 1845, and the younger woman offered to settle her there. Berry chose to return to Lucy Ann and her familiar St. Louis roots. She died without seeing her husband again.\n\nMore than 45 years later, after a life of civic activism, in 1891 Lucy Ann Berry Delaney (then married) published her memoir \"From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom\". The only first-person account of a freedom suit, the slave narrative was devoted mostly to recounting her mother's struggle for their freedom from slavery. Delaney dedicated the book to the Grand Army of the Republic, which had secured the freedom of slaves throughout the South in its victory in the American Civil War. She described her adult life and full participation in religious and civic organizations.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that the Wash and Berry case files were discovered. Although some—such as the Dred and Harriet Scott files—had been set aside, most freedom suits were filed by case number together with all the other circuit court case files; surviving indices generally listed them under the broad rubric of \"trespass.\" Some suits had been filed against the leading families of St. Louis, such as Chouteau, Cabanné, Sarpy, and Papin, who were slaveholders before and after the Louisiana Purchase. Under the St. Louis Circuit Court Historical Records Project, the case files are available to scholars for research, and a searchable database with digitized images of each case file is online.\n\n\n"}

The appellation covers the lower parts of the Corton hill and includes several subordinate vineyard names, or \"climats\", within the AOC. Because of the size of the AOC and the variability of these \"climats\", it is the rule rather than the exception that the name of the \"climat\" is indicated together with that of the Corton AOC, leading to designations such as Corton Clos du Roi and Corton Les Bressandes. Corton is rare in this aspect, as the 'climat' is seldom used for other Grand Cru appellations in Côte d'Or. The AOC was created in 1937.\n\nCorton wines are mostly red (around 95 per cent of the total production in the AOC) and made from the Pinot noir grape, however a smaller quantity of white Corton from Chardonnay is also produced.

He made his MLB debut with the New York Yankees on May 3, 2005, played for them through the 2013 season, and was a member of their 2009 World Series winning team over the Philadelphia Phillies. He played for the Seattle Mariners from 2014 through 2018. He has represented the Dominican Republic in international play, including winning both the gold medal and Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) of the 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC) tournament.\n\nFrom San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic, the Yankees signed Canó as an amateur free agent on January 5, 2001. He is an eight-time MLB All-Star, five-time Silver Slugger Award winner, and two-time Gold Glove Award winner. He was the 2017 All-Star Game MVP and the 2011 Home Run Derby winner. Along with WBC teammates Octavio Dotel and Santiago Casilla, Canó became one of the first four players to have won both a World Series and World Baseball Classic. He recorded 1,695 base hits during the 2010s, the most of any major league player. On December 6, 2013, Canó signed a 10-year, $240 million USD deal with the Mariners.\n\nIn 2018, Canó was suspended 80 games for violating Major League Baseball’s joint drug agreement for his use of furosemide. After the 2018 season, he was traded to the Mets.\n\nHis father, José Canó, signed with the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1980 and pitched in the Yankees' and Atlanta Braves minor league systems before making his Major League debut and pitching six games for the Houston Astros in 1989. Robinson was named after baseball legend Jackie Robinson.\n\nCanó was born in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic, and grew up in the Dominican Republic, though he lived in New Jersey for three years. He spent seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in the Newark school system, attending Barringer High School for one year. When his family moved back to the Dominican Republic, Canó attended San Pedro Apostol High School in San Pedro de Macorís, where he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams. In the Dominican Winter Baseball League he plays for his hometown team, the Estrellas Orientales.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Canó was signed by the Yankees on January 5, 2001 as an amateur free agent, receiving a signing bonus of over $100,000. He began playing in their minor league system that season, debuting with the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and the Staten Island Yankees of the Class-A Short Season New York–Penn League. Canó played for Staten Island and the Greensboro Bats of the Class-A South Atlantic League in 2002. Canó played for the Tampa Yankees of the Class-A Advanced Florida State League and Trenton Thunder of the Class-AA Eastern League in 2003, by which point he was viewed as a top prospect. Canó appeared in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game.\n\nCanó was one of the five prospects offered to the Texas Rangers to complete the Yankees' acquisition of Alex Rodriguez before the 2004 season. The Rangers selected Joaquín Árias instead.\n\nCanó began the 2004 season with Trenton, receiving a promotion to the Columbus Clippers of the Class-AAA International League. When the Kansas City Royals began to seek trade offers for Carlos Beltrán, the Yankees moved Canó to third base in an effort to showcase Canó for the Royals. The next month, the Yankees attempted to trade him to the Arizona Diamondbacks as part of a package to acquire Randy Johnson. He began the 2005 season with Columbus.\n\nCanó was called up to the Major Leagues on May 3, 2005, while hitting .330 in 108 at bats with Columbus, and took over second base from Tony Womack. On May 5 Canó got his first career base hit off of Hideo Nomo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Canó belted his first career grand slam this season as well. He finished second in American League Rookie of the Year balloting to Huston Street of the Oakland Athletics. Canó finished the year, however, with the third-worst walk percentage in the league, 3.0%. During 2005, manager Joe Torre compared Canó to Hall of Famer Rod Carew. Torre clarified that he meant that Canó \"reminded\" him of Carew, in terms of his build, presence at the plate, and smoothness in his swing.\n\nIn 2006, Canó led the American League (AL) All-Star balloting at second base, but could not play after being placed on the disabled list for a strained hamstring. After his return from injury, however, on August 8, 2006, Canó led the league in batting average, doubles, and runs batted in. During late September 2006, Canó accumulated enough at-bats to once again qualify for the AL batting race. Canó was rewarded the AL Player of the Month award for September.\n\nCanó finished 2006 with the third best batting average in the AL (.342, just 2 points behind teammate shortstop Derek Jeter and five points behind Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer), and 9th in the league in doubles (41). He also led the AL in batting average on the road (.364; 96/264) and after the 6th inning (.353; 55/156). He had the third-worst walk percentage in the league at 3.6%. Canó received three votes for AL MVP.\n\nIn 2007, Canó gave up his number 22 to Roger Clemens, choosing to wear the number 24, a reversal of Jackie Robinson's number 42, in tribute to him. After a slow start to the 2007 season which saw him hit a meager .249 through May 29, Canó found his stroke batting .385 in the month of July with 6 HR and 24 RBI to raise his season average to .300 by the end of the month. He finished 2007 sixth in the league in games played (160), ninth in triples (7), and tenth in hits (189), doubles (41), and at bats (617). He was the only batter in the top 10 in doubles in the AL in both 2006 and 2007.\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Canó signed a contract extension for $28 million over the next four years in the 2008 through 2011 seasons. The deal also includes options for the Yankees for the 2012 and 2013 seasons, worth $27 million.\n\nCanó struggled early in the 2008 season, hitting only .151 in April with just 7 RBIs. He improved later in the year, hitting .300 from May through August.\n\nCanó recorded the final walk-off hit in Yankee Stadium history by singling in the winning run in the bottom of the 9th inning in the Yankees 1–0 victory over the Orioles on September 20, 2008. In the final game at Yankee Stadium the next night (September 21, 2008), Canó recorded the final RBI in Stadium history with his sacrifice fly in the 7th inning, scoring Brett Gardner with the Stadium's final run. Canó missed only five games over the 2007 and 2008 seasons, and was one of only three Yankees to hit a home run as a pinch hitter.\n\nIn 2009, Canó hit .320 with 204 hits, 25 home runs and 85 RBIs. Canó ranked in the top ten among players in the American league in hits, extra base hits, total bases, at bats, doubles, batting average, runs scored, and triples. It was his first year hitting over 20 HRs. His 200th hit against the Boston Red Sox to clinch the AL East Division made him and Derek Jeter the first middle infield duo in MLB history to both have 200 hits in the same season.\n\nHis 204 hits ranked third for hits during the 2009 season, and first among all second basemen. Canó also led second basemen in batting average. Canó also played in 161 games which was the most games played by a player during the 2009 season. He also hit his first career walk-off home run: a 3-run walk-off home run on August 28 against the White Sox. On November 4, Canó threw out Shane Victorino for the final out of the 2009 World Series.\n\nWith the departure of Hideki Matsui, Canó was moved into the fifth spot in the batting order. For his early season performance, Canó was named the American League Player of the Month for April 2010. He was elected as the starting second baseman in the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and was selected to participate in the 2010 Home Run Derby; however, he withdrew due to a minor injury. He finished the season with a milestone 200 hits and 100+ RBIs (109).\n\nCanó has performed ably in the middle of the lineup, replacing Matsui and Alex Rodriguez while Rodriguez was on the disabled list, as he has improved his batting with runners in scoring position.\n\nCanó hit .343 with 4 home runs and 6 RBIs in the 2010 postseason. He finished the season with a .996 fielding percentage, the best for a second baseman in MLB, committing only 3 errors in 158 games. He turned 114 double plays and recorded 341 putouts. Canó won the American League Gold Glove Award for second basemen in 2010, the first by a Yankee second baseman since Bobby Richardson's five-year run from 1961 to 1965. Canó also won the American League Silver Slugger Award for second basemen with a batting average of .319, 29 home runs and 109 runs batted in. In addition, he finished third in the voting for American League MVP.\n\nCanó had a rough first half to his defensive season. By July, he had committed twice as many errors as he had in his entire Gold Glove-winning 2010 season, in which he had three.\n\nCanó was selected for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a starting second baseman, and was chosen to participate in the 2011 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby. With his father pitching, Canó won the derby, setting a record for home runs in the final round with 12 home runs despite having an additional four outs remaining.\n\nFacing the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on August 10, Canó fell a single short of hitting for the cycle. It marked the second time in his career that he missed the cycle by a single (the first being in 2005). Canó finished the 2011 season had 188 hits and a career high in RBIs with 118.\n\nIn Game 1 of the 2011 American League Division Series, Canó hit a grand slam in the bottom of the 6th inning to put the Yankees up 8–1. It marked his fourth grand slam of the year, including the regular season. He sandwiched the home run between two run-scoring doubles, giving him 6 total RBI for the game. The Yankees would eventually lose the division series in a 5-game span.\n\nWhile Canó hit only one home run in April, he recovered to hit 7 homers in May, and a career-high 11 home runs in June. He returned to compete in the 2012 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby but was not able to repeat the previous year's victory. Instead, he hit zero home runs and finished in last place, and was booed by the Kansas City fans for not having chosen the Royals' Billy Butler to participate in the competition after previously stating that he would choose a Royal. He became the 9th player to fail to hit a HR in the Derby, and first since Brandon Inge did in 2009.\nOn July 20, 2012, Canó extended his career-high hitting streak to 23 games with a single off of Oakland Athletics pitcher Tommy Milone in a 3–2 Yankees loss. And, in the last 10 games of the season, he went on a ferocious tear, going 24 for 39 for an .615 average with 3 home runs, 7 doubles and 14 RBI. Canó finished the 2012 season with a .313 batting average, 48 doubles, 33 home runs, and 94 RBI.\n\nCanó performed poorly during the postseason. Over his first eight games in the 2012 ALDS and ALCS, he batted .083 (3-for-36), including a stretch from October 9–16 when he was hitless after 29 at-bats, the longest hitless streak for any single year of the postseason play in MLB history. In the Game 4 finale, when the Tigers' sweep of the Yankees was complete, again Canó went 0–4, and his 2012 postseason average dropped to .075 (3-for-40).\n\nOn October 29, the Yankees exercised Canó's club option for 2013 for $15 million, keeping him away from free agency for another year.\n\nOn April 13, 2013, Canó made his first career appearance at shortstop. He began the first half of the 2013 season with a .302 batting average, 21 home runs, and 65 RBI. He was named the American League captain for the 2013 home run derby. During his only plate appearance of the 2013 All-Star Game, he was hit by a pitch thrown by Matt Harvey and suffered a right quad contusion. Cano left the game and was replaced by Dustin Pedroia. He only played for two pitches.\n\nOn August 20, Canó hit his 200th career home run, a three-run blast to center field off of Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Esmil Rogers at Yankee Stadium.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, Canó batted .314 with 190 hits, 27 home runs, and 107 RBI in 160 games played.\n\nIn December 2013, Canó signed a 10-year, $240 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. Canó was offered a 7-year, $175 million contract to return to the Yankees, but turned it down in search of a longer deal.\n\nCanó made his debut for the Mariners on March 31, going 2–4 with a double. Canó recorded his first RBI for the Mariners on April 2. On July 6, Canó was named the American League starting second baseman for the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. This marked Canó's 6th career All Star selection, and his 5th consecutive. Canó finished the season with a .314 batting average with 14 HR and 82 RBI. During August, he began to suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms that were later diagnosed as resulting from an intestinal parasite.\n\nAfter the season, Canó traveled to Japan to join a team of MLB All-Stars playing against All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the 2014 Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series. He fractured a toe during the series, requiring 3–4 weeks to heal.\n\nCanó suffered through acid reflux during the 2015 season, which resulted from the treatment of the parasite. He was not named to the 2015 All-Star Game roster, ending a streak of five consecutive years as an All-Star. He hit .287 with 21 home runs, 34 doubles, and 79 RBIs in 156 games during the 2015 season, but improved in the second half of the season, batting .330. He tied for 2nd in the AL in double plays grounded into, with 26. After the 2015 season, Cano had surgery to repair a sports hernia.\n\nOn May 7, 2016, Canó hit his 250th career home run, joining Joe Gordon and Jeff Kent as the only second basemen to reach 250 career home runs within the first 12 years of their career. He was selected to his seventh All-Star Game, played at Petco Park in San Diego. On August 28, Canó reached 30 home runs for the second time in his career, hitting it against the Chicago White Sox. In 161 games, Canó finished the season with a .298 batting average, 195 hits, 33 doubles, 39 home runs, and 103 RBI.\n\nOn May 16, 2017, the Mariners placed Canó on the 10-day disabled list due to a right quadriceps strain, retroactive to May 13. It was only the second time that Canó went on the disabled list in his career.\n\nIn the All-Star Game at Marlins Park, Canó hit a home run in the top of the tenth inning off of Wade Davis that would give the American League a 2–1 win, earning him All-Star Game MVP honors.\n\nOn September 13, Canó was ejected for the first time in his career for arguing with Vic Carapazza over a strike call. Canó hit his 300th career home run on September 21 versus Keone Kela of the Texas Rangers, becoming just the third second baseman in history to reach the milestone, following Jeff Kent (377) and Rogers Hornsby (301). The home run also made him the 16th major leaguer to bat at least .300 with 2,000 hits, 1,000 runs scored, 1,000 runs driven in, and 500 doubles.\n\nCanó homered versus Lance McCullers Jr. in a 4–1 loss to the Houston Astros on April 18, 2018, to give him 302 for his career, and pass Hornsby for second place all-time among second basemen. On April 29, Canó hit his 100th home run as a member of the Mariners, versus Josh Tomlin in a 10–4 victory over the Cleveland Indians. On May 13, against the Tigers, Canó was hit by a pitch on the right hand, and left the game. His right hand was diagnosed with a fracture in the fifth metacarpal bone.\n\nTwo days into his injury, on May 15, Canó was suspended 80 games for testing positive for Furosemide, a diuretic better known as Lasix, which was a violation of MLB's performance-enhancing drugs policy. Canó returned to the Mariners on August 14, having served his suspension.\n\nFor the season, he batted .303/.374/.471. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league second basemen, at 24.5 feet/second.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, the Mariners traded Canó, Edwin Díaz, and $20 million to the New York Mets for Jay Bruce, Jarred Kelenic, Anthony Swarzak, Gerson Bautista, and Justin Dunn. In his first at bat as a Met, he hit a home run off of Max Scherzer. He later drove in another run in the Mets' 2-0 Opening Day victory.\n\nAfter a first half of the season which included two stints on the injured list, a career-high strikeout rate, and earned him an 'F' grade from Mike Puma of the \"New York Post\", the Mets' trade for Canó was described as \"a massive misstep\" by Connor Byrne writing for MLB Trade Rumors, and as \"an unmitigated disaster\" by Mike Mazzeo of Yahoo Sports. On July 23, 2019, Canó had his first career three-home-run game and drove in all five of the team's runs during a game at Citi Field against the San Diego Padres. However, Canó's second half saw a major improvement - he posted a second half OPS of .880 versus a .646 OPS in the first half.\n\nIn 2019, he batted .256 (the lowest of his career)/.307/.428 with 13 home runs and a career-low 39 RBIs. He again had the slowest sprint speed of all major league second basemen, at 24.7 feet/second.\n\nCanó has participated for his native country, Dominican Republic, in three World Baseball Classic (WBC) tournaments, held in 2009, 2013, and 2017.\n\nIn the 2013 edition, Canó batted 15-for-32 (.469). The Dominican Republic defeated Puerto Rico 3–0 in the finals to win the championship and became the first undefeated team in the tournament's history. Canó was named the Most Valuable Player of the Classic. He joined teammates Octavio Dotel and Santiago Casilla as part of the four players to ever have won a World Series and World Baseball Classic, after Daisuke Matsuzaka completed the feat. The four were later joined by a fifth, Koji Uehara, after he won in 2013 with the Boston Red Sox. Uehara's Red Sox teammate Andrew Miller would join this club too when Team USA won in 2017. Team USA that year brought in several members into this group to include Buster Posey with the San Francisco Giants in 2010 and also later with Brandon Crawford for the 2012, and 2014 World Series contests; Eric Hosmer with the Kansas City Royals in 2015; Cano's 2009 teammate David Robertson; and Luke Gregerson and Alex Bregman with the Houston Astros also later that year. Several other former players would also match this feat in 2017 when Team USA won, but as coaches: Alan Trammell a player for the Detroit Tigers in 1984 while Willie Randolph and Cano's brief 2005 teammate Tino Martinez did so with the Yankees in the 1970s and 1990s respectively.\n\nIn 2017, Canó was named the captain of the Dominican Republic team. After going 3-0 in the first round, the Dominican Republic lost its first game to Puerto Rico which ended their streak of 11 straight wins dating back to the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The team failed to advance to the championship round and Canó finished 6-for-20 (.300) with a home run and three RBIs.\n\n\n\n\nCanó is noted for his charity work. Hackensack University Medical Center (in New Jersey) named a pediatric rehabilitation ward after him. Canó has a son, also named Robinson, who lives with his mother in the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn November 13, 2012, Canó became a naturalized United States citizen.\n\n"}

A traditional \"Lucky Bag\" has a collection of photos taken around the academy and photographs of each graduating officer along with a single paragraph describing the individual written by a friend. While no one knows for sure, it is speculated that it is named after the \"lucky bag\" that contains the possessions of sailors who lost items at sea.\n\nEach year every midshipman and graduating officer receives a \"Lucky Bag\", and every edition of the \"Lucky Bag\" is archived by both the Naval Academy and the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association.\n\nEvery man-of-war, you know, has her Lucky Bag, containing a little of every thing, and something belonging to every body.\n\nFor variety of contents, a regular Lucky Bag may vie with the caldron that witches boil and bubble “at the pit of Acheron.”\n\n“This bag,” Mr. Editor, which I am about to overhaul, has been open for fifteen or twenty years. The facts collected about the Navy during that time — hints dropped by messmates — opinions, notions, &c., have, been picked up and carefully preserved in this “bag.” Before I proceed though, to arrange from this medley of the “bit o’ writin” for you, mm, I must in good earnest bespeak the indulgence of your readers, and seriously invite their attention to the facts which go to show a link to 10 pages,1840 Lucky Bag article on Naval Reform, by Lieut. Matthew Fontaine Maury, U.S.Navy.\n\nMatthew Fontaine Maury, USN, used the term \"Lucky Bag\", and defined it, long before the United States Naval Academy was created. Matthew Maury wrote many articles about the \"Lucky Bag\" and called the articles, \"Scraps From The Lucky Bag\". It was information on Naval reform in all its venues and more. This is well known by serious historians. The use of term goes back further than 1820 in the United States Navy and back to the British Navy. Read the link to see a typical \"Lucky Bag Scrap\" on US Naval Reform. The United States Naval Academy, to a huge extent, was created due to Matthew Maury's \"Scraps From The Lucky Bag\" that were published under noms de plumes in newspapers, copied, and passed around in flyers in and outside of the USN to stir people to action for changes in the Navy and transcribed by William Maury Morris for these modern times.\n\nThe lucky bag is also defined as a where loose items from a ship are stored until being returned to the owner. According to the 1940 edition of \"The Bluejacket's Manual\" (a handbook for U.S. Navy enlisted personnel), \"The \"lucky bag\" is a place where the police petty officers stow for safe-keeping effects that are found adrift about the ship. All clothes, etc., found about the decks are placed in the lucky bag. When clothes are piped down, the police petty officer attends and takes care of all clothes not called for and places these in the lucky bag. All effects in this bag belong to the person who lost them. At frequent intervals the lucky bag is opened and the effects distributed to the owners. Where persons have been guilty of carelessness in leaving their effects adrift, they are placed on the report.\" According to the log of the USS \"Yosemite\", on June 24, 1898 several sailors were given 72 hours extra duty for having an article in the lucky bag.\n\n"}

Its first owners were S & J.M. Flanagan of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was purchased by the Navy at Philadelphia 10 July 1861; and commissioned in August 1861, Lieutenant Alexander Murray in command.\n\nAssigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, until January 1862 \"Louisiana\" operated along the Virginia coast, blocking the passage of Confederate blockade runners, and attacking them at their bases. The \"Louisiana\" also participated in operations like the battle for Roanoke Island on 7–8 February, 1862 and the Battle of Elizabeth City on 10 February, which denied the use of coastal inlets and seaboard towns to the blockade runners and tied down Confederate troops to guard those bases which could be held. On 13 September 1861, with , \"Louisiana\" engaged CSS \"Patrick Henry\" off Newport News, Virginia, but shot from both sides fell short. Two of her boats destroyed a schooner fitting out as a Confederate privateer in the Battle of Cockle Creek near Chincoteague Inlet 5 October, and two days later she captured schooner \"S. T. Carrison\" with a cargo of wood near Wallops Island.\n\nChincoteague Island was lost to the Confederacy as a base when on 14 October \"Louisiana's\" Lt. Murray witnessed the administration of the oath of allegiance to the United States to Chincoteague's citizens. Her boats, led by Lt. Alfred Hopkins, surprised and burned three Confederate vessels at Chincoteague Inlet 28 and 29 October.\n\nOn 2 January 1862, \"Louisiana\" was ordered to Hatteras Inlet to prepare for the invasion of the Carolina Sounds. For the next three years, she patrolled, supported Army troops and made raids along the many miles of the intricate water system whose eventual capture would be a mortal blow to the Confederacy. Typical of such actions was that of 6 September 1862, when she tried to aid Union troops repelling Confederate attacks on Washington, North Carolina. Their commander, Major General John G. Poster, reported that \"Louisiana\" \"had rendered most efficient aid, throwing her shells with great precision, and clearing the streets, through which her guns had range.\"\n\nShe captured schooner \"Alice L. Webb\" at Rose Bay, North Carolina, 5 November 1862, then joined in the Army–Navy expedition which captured Greenville, North Carolina, four days later. On 20 May 1863, one of her boatcrews under Acting Master's Mate Charles W. Fisher, captured a still unrigged schooner in the Tar River north of Washington, N.C. The prize was named for \"Louisiana's\" captain, Richard T. Renshaw, and taken into the Navy as an ordnance hulk.\n\nFort Fisher, guarding Wilmington, North Carolina, was the key to the base which northern commanders foresaw the South employing after the fall of Charleston, and Commodore David Dixon Porter and Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler, knowing that an assault on so powerful a defense would be long and costly, hoped to reduce it by blowing up an explosive laden ship under its walls. On 26 November 1864 contrary to naval ordnance experts' advice, \"Louisiana\" was designated for this assignment, and early in December she proceeded to Hampton Roads to be partially stripped and laden with explosives. She left Hampton Roads 13 December in tow of for Beaufort, North Carolina, where the loading of powder was completed, and five days later arrived off Fort Fisher. Here took up the tow, and Commander Alexander Rhind with a volunteer crew prepared for the attack. \"Wilderness\" and \"Louisiana\" continued toward Fort Fisher, but were turned back by the heavy swells which with worsening weather delayed the entire amphibious attack in leaving its base at Beaufort. The final attempt was made on 23 December, when \"Wilderness\" brought \"Louisiana\" into position under Fort Fisher late in the evening. Rhind and his crew lit the fuses and kindled a fire aft, then escaped in small boats to \"Wilderness\". waiting anxiously for 01:18 24 December, when the fuses were timed to explode. They failed, but the fire set aft worked its way from the stern to the powder and blew \"Louisiana\" up as planned, but with little effect. Several weeks later, the massed gunfire of the fleet and amphibious assault reduced the last great bastion of the Carolina Sounds.\n\nIn 1994 state underwater archaeologists and students from East Carolina University conducted a survey of the area off Fort Fisher. Though many Civil War era wrecks were mapped, no remains were found that could be associated with that of the \"Louisiana\".\n\n"}

It rises in the Alps and empties about later into the Brenta River near Chioggia. It flows through and past a number of cities, including Vicenza and Padua. It acted for many centuries as a significant waterway up to Vicenza, above which it ceases to be navigable. It was connected in the 19th century to the Adige by a canal.\n\nThe river starts in some springs in the towns of Dueville and Villaverla, in the province of Vicenza. Here it is called \"Bacchiglioncello\". Just upstream of the city of Vicenza receives water from the Leogra Timonchio (which descends from Mount Pasubio). At this junction, the river becomes the Bacchiglione.\n\nAt Ponte del Bo, above Vicenza, it joins with the Orolo. In Vicenza, the Bacchiglione is joined by the rivers Tesina, Retrone and Astichello. The river is about long and has a basin of . The average flow of the Bacchiglione in Padua is about 30 m/s and flows through the summer dry season.\nAt Longare, the Bisatto (or \"Bisato\") Canal was built in the twelfth century. Verona and Vicenza built it to divert water away from Padua during the many political struggles of the time, as told in the ninth canto of Dante's \"Paradiso\". The channel goes to Lozzo Atestino and Este; then continues to Monselice (\"Este - Montelice Canal\"). Then into the Battaglia Terme (\"Battle Canal\" or \"Monselice Canal\"), where it meets the Battaglia Canal from Padua. Through the Vigenzone Canal (\"Cagnola Canal \") waters are reunited with the river Bacchiglione (\"Channel Pontelongo\"), allowing Vicenza to arrive in Chioggia without having to pass through Padua.\n\nThe Brentella Canal originates from the Brenta River in Limena, where the flow is regulated by a hydraulic barrier (the \"Colmelloni\"), and joins the Bacchiglione just before Padua's airport. The Brentella Canal was built in 1314 Padua to prevent the city of Vicenza from stopping the river when it created the Bisatto Canal.\n\nOn the southern outskirts of Padua, the Battaglia Canal begins. Built in the 12th century, it heads south towards Battaglia Spa. This is connection from the Canal Bisatto, which separated from the Bacchiglione River at Vicenza.

{"id": "1972886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972886", "title": "Frankie Darro", "text": "Frankie Darro\n\nFrankie Darro (born Frank Johnson, Jr.; December 22, 1917 – December 25, 1976) was an American actor and later in his career a stuntman. He began his career as a child actor in silent films, progressed to lead roles and co-starring roles in adventure, western, dramatic, and comedy films, and later became a character actor and voice-over artist. He is perhaps best known for his role as Lampwick, the unlucky boy who turns into a donkey in Walt Disney's second animated feature, \"Pinocchio\" (1940). In early credits, his last name was spelled Darrow.\n\nFrankie Darro was born on Saturday, December 22, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, as Frank Johnson, Jr. His parents, Frank Johnson, Sr. and his wife Ada, were known as \"The Flying Johnsons\", a flying circus act with the Sells Floto Circus; it was a profession that his father attempted to train him in, and he cured Frankie's fear of heights by having him walk on a length of wire, gradually raising the height of it until his son had mastered the trick.\n\nIn 1922, while the circus was in California, his parents divorced, and their circus act ended along with their marriage. The growing film industry, however, found a use for a small child who could do his own stunts, and the young Johnson, renamed \"Frankie Darro,\" appeared in his first film at the age of six.\n\nAs a child actor, he appeared in many silent adventure, western, and serial pictures of the 1920s. His visual appeal and his obvious comfort before the cameras kept him steadily employed. Darro remained popular in serials as the star or co-star; he appeared in the serial \"The Phantom Empire\", opposite the new cowboy star Gene Autry.\n\nDarro was featured in Mervyn LeRoy's \"Three on a Match\" in 1932 and was the principal character in the James Cagney feature \"The Mayor of Hell\" (1933). His most important role during the 1930s was as the lead in \"Wild Boys of the Road\", director William Wellman's indictment of teens vagabonding across America during the Depression. From then on, Frankie Darro was usually cast as pint-sized tough guys, although he also played wholesome leads in mysteries and comedies.\n\nDarro's name grew in stature, but he himself didn't: he stood only five feet, three inches, limiting his potential as a leading man. His wiry, athletic frame and relatively short stature often typecast him as jockeys; Darro played crooked riders in \"Charlie Chan at the Race Track\" and \"A Day at the Races\". In 1938 Darro joined Monogram Pictures to star in a series of action melodramas. Darro's flair for comedy gradually increased the laugh content in these films, and by 1940 Mantan Moreland was hired to play his sidekick. The Frankie Darro series was so successful that Monogram used it as a haven for performers whose own series had been discontinued: Jackie Moran, Marcia Mae Jones, and Keye Luke joined Darro and Moreland in 1940, and Gale Storm was added in 1941.\n\nDarro served in the US Navy Hospital Corps during World War II, wherein he contracted malaria. Upon his return to civilian life, Monogram welcomed him back and cast the perennially youthful Darro in its \"The Teen Agers\" campus comedies. When that series ended, the studio gave Darro four featured roles in its popular Bowery Boys comedies. Darro's last assignment for Monogram, in 1950, was doubling for Leo Gorcey in \"Blues Busters\".\n\nDarro's recurring malaria symptoms caused him to increase his alcohol intake for pain management, and this affected his career. As film and TV roles became fewer, Darro opened his own tavern, naming it \"Try Later\" after the answer he most often received when he asked Central Casting for work. His new occupation proved unwise, however, given his heavy drinking. By the mid-1950s, he had become too risky for producers to hire steadily.\n\nNo longer starring in films, Darro accepted smaller roles and did stunt work for other actors in various films. Frankie Darro is probably best known to modern audiences for two films in which he isn't even seen: Walt Disney's \"Pinocchio\" (1940, as the voice of Lampwick) and \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956, as one of the actor/operators \"inside\" the now iconic 7-foot-tall \"Robby the Robot\").\n\nDarro did continue to play small parts well into the 1960s, mostly on television: \"The Red Skelton Show\", \"Bat Masterson\", \"Have Gun—Will Travel\", \"The Untouchables\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Addams Family\", and \"Batman\" (episodes 9 and 10); he also did voice-over work for various projects.\n\nWhile visiting an ex-wife and his step-daughter Christy in Huntington Beach, California, Darro died of a heart attack on Christmas Day 1976, three days after his 59th birthday. His remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n"}

Notable bands that can be linked to the Afro-punk community include: Death, Pure Hell, Bad Brains, Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Kennedys, Fishbone, Wesley Willis Fiasco, Suffrajett, The Templars, Unlocking the Truth and Rough Francis. In the United Kingdom, influential black musicians associated with the late 1970s punk scene included Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex, Don Letts and Basement 5. Afro-punk has become a movement, comparable to the early hip hop movement of the 1980s. The Afropunk Music Festival was founded in 2005 by James Spooner and Matthew Morgan. \"In their 15 years of existence, Afropunk has managed to curate an environment that can only be described as an ethereal, momentary hideaway for black people from all corners and crevices of the diaspora —and this year was no different. The festival explicitly invites folks to come and be who they are, wear whatever they wear, and dance how they dance. It was a blank space to freak out in—and freak out they did.\" -GQStyle\n\n\"AFROPUNK became a radical act of self care — a realized demand of safe spaces for people of color.\" -TeenVogue\n\n\"The musicians at AFROPUNK were there not just to sing and rap but to celebrate and give voice to communities of difference.

It was first established as a repertory theatre in 1948 when it operated from a former cinema in Goldsmith Street. Directors during this period included Val May and Frank Dunlop. The current building opened in 1963.\n\nThe architect of the current theatre, constructed as an example of Modern architecture, was Peter Moro who had worked on the interior design of the Royal Festival Hall in London. When the theatre was completed, it was controversial as it faces the gothic revival Roman Catholic cathedral designed by Augustus Pugin. However, the buildings received a Civic Trust Award in 1965. Despite the modern external appearance and the circular auditorium walls, the theatre has a proscenium layout, seating an audience of 770.\n\nDuring the 1980s, when the concrete interiors were out of fashion, the Playhouse suffered from insensitive \"refurbishment\" that sought to hide its character. Since 1996, it has been a Grade II* listed building and in 2004, the theatre was sympathetically restored and refurbished with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.\n\nThe sculpture Sky Mirror by Anish Kapoor was installed between the theatre and the adjacent green space of Wellington Circus in 2001 at a cost of £1.25m (). It is one of the main features of the 160 seat patio area of Cast Restaurant and in autumn 2007 won the Nottingham Pride of Place in a public vote to determine the city's favourite landmark.\n\nIn 2014-15 Nottingham Playhouse underwent a complete environmental upgrade including insulation of the fly tower, secondary and double glazing and installing PV panels. The works were jointly funded by Arts Council England, Nottingham City Council, patron donations and philanthropist Sir Harry Djanogly. The award-winning works have been calculated to cut annual energy usage by over 35%.\n\nThe new theatre's artistic direction was shared between Frank Dunlop and actor John Neville with Peter Ustinov as associate.\n\nThe first production in the new theatre was Shakespeare's \"Coriolanus\" in a production by Tyrone Guthrie. This included a young Ian McKellen as Tullus Aufidius opposite Neville in the title role.\n\nSubsequent artistic directors were Stuart Burge, Richard Eyre, Geoffrey Reeves, Richard Digby Day, Kenneth Alan Taylor, Pip Broughton and Martin Duncan. The Playhouse is currently under the leadership of Stephanie Sirr, Chief Executive and Giles Croft, Artistic Director. In Spring 2017 it was announced that Adam Penford would succeed Croft as Artistic Director from September 2017.\n\nNottingham Playhouse has a strong tradition of new works for children, both in the form of original writing and more recently in the form of classic pantomimes conceived by former artistic director Kenneth Alan Taylor. Taylor has directed 34 consecutive pantomimes at the theatre as of 2013.\n\nIn common with most producing theatres, Nottingham Playhouse no longer has a repertory approach to programming although it continues to create up to 13 new productions per annum. Its recent plays include \"Old Big 'Ead in the Spirit of the Man\", a homage to Nottingham legend Brian Clough, \"Rat Pack Confidential\" and \"Summer and Smoke\", which both transferred to the West End and \"The Burial at Thebes\" which was part of the Barbican BITE season of autumn 2007 and toured the US in 2008. Its production of \"Oedipus\". created by Steven Berkoff. toured to the Spoleto Festival and stage adaptation of \"On the Waterfront\" to the West End for an extended run.\n\nIn 2013, an adaptation of \"The Kite Runner\" by Matthew Spangler produced by Nottingham Playhouse became the theatre's best selling ever drama up to that point in time. Autumn 2014 saw a successful UK tour of the piece.\n\nIn 2013, Nottingham Playhouse celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Moro designed building. The commemorative season included world premiere productions of \"1984\", \"Grandpa in my Pocket\", \"I Was A Rat\" by Philip Pullman and \"Charlie Peace: His Amazing Life and Astounding Legend\". A major new production of \"Richard III\", Alan Ayckbourn's \"Joking Apart\" and a revival of \"The Ashes\" along with Kenneth Alan Taylor's 30th pantomime \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" completed the year.\n\nIn 2014, 2015 and 2016 the Nottingham Playhouse and Headlong Theatre production of \"1984\" played at the Playhouse Theatre in London's West End to positive reviews. In Autumn 2015' it toured to Australia and the USA. In 2016' it was announced that the award-winning Nottingham Playhouse production of The Kite Runner would transfer to the West End from December 2016 to March 2017. The run has subsequently been extended to the Playhouse Theatre in summer 2017 prior to a second UK tour.\n\nIn 2013, the theatre was awarded £1m from Arts Council England to undertake upgrading of the theatre's energy efficiency. Fiona Buffini's \"'Mass Bolero\" marked 2014 - a tribute to Nottingham born Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean's gold medal winning performance at the 1984 winter olympics in Sarajevo by the people of Nottingham. Over 800 Nottingham residents took part and the work has currently been viewed almost 80,000 times on YouTube.\n\nIn 2017 Touched by Nottingham writer Stephen Lowe and starring Nottingham-born actress Vicky McClure became the Playhouse's best-selling ever drama.\n\nThe highlight of its 70th anniversary 2018 season will be \"The Madness of George III\" by Alan Bennett starring Mark Gatiss, Debra Gillett and Adrian Scarborough.\n\nMass Bolero\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WOO6qoEcgo\n\n"}
{"id": "1972911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972911", "title": "Illini and Saluki", "text": "Illini and Saluki\n\nThe Illini and Saluki are a pair of passenger trains operated by Amtrak along a route between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. They are part of Amtrak's Illinois Service and are primarily funded by the state of Illinois. The route is coextensive with the far northern leg of the long-distance \"City of New Orleans\". The \"Illini\" has operated since 1973; a previous version operated in 1971–1972 between Chicago and Champaign. The \"Saluki\" debuted in 2006.\n\nThe Illinois Central Railroad's main line between Chicago and New Orleans ran through Champaign–Urbana and Carbondale, along the east side of Illinois. At the formation of Amtrak in 1971, the Illinois Central still operated a number of services from its Central Station in Chicago over this route, including the \"Illini\" and \"Shawnee\" (Chicago-Carbondale), the \"City of New Orleans\" and the \"Panama Limited\" (both, Chicago–New Orleans), plus the \"City of Miami\" (Chicago–Birmingham).\n\nAmtrak retained two trains on this route: the \"City of New Orleans\" (which it named the \"Panama Limited\") and the \"Shawnee\". Amtrak brought back the \"Illini\" name on November 14, 1971, as a Chicago-Champaign train, operating in conjunction with the \"Campus\". It was named for the Illini, from which the state of Illinois and the Fighting Illini mascot of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign get their names. Amtrak discontinued the \"Campus\" and \"Illini\" on March 5, 1972. Both trains used Central Station, which Amtrak was abandoning; Amtrak judged that the additional 35–40 minutes necessary to serve Union Station made the schedule impractical. The 1972 \"Illini\" made its last trip on March 3.\n\nAmtrak revived the \"Illini\" on December 19, 1973, again as a Chicago–Champaign service. The restoration was part of $1.5 million expansion program which included the \"Black Hawk\" (Chicago–Rockford–Dubuque), the \"State House\" (St. Louis–Chicago), and supplemental funding for the Rock Island's two remaining Rockets (Chicago–Peoria and Chicago–Rock Island). The state desired to extend the \"Illini\" to Decatur, but doing so involved a switch from the Illinois Central to the Norfolk & Western at Tolono, south of Champaign. The connection between the lines was in poor condition, and no one would take responsibility for repairing it.\n\nAmtrak finally extended the \"Illini\" to Decatur on July 2, 1981. Decatur had last seen service in 1971 from the Norfolk & Western's \"City of Decatur\" (Chicago–Decatur) and the Wabash's \"Wabash Cannon Ball\" (Detroit–St. Louis). Neither train had been retained by Amtrak. The new Amtrak service used the old Wabash station, which still stands and has become an antique store. Poor ridership prompted Illinois to withdraw its support for the Decatur stop, and Amtrak cut the \"Illini\" back to Champaign on July 10, 1983.\n\nOn January 12, 1986, Amtrak extended the \"Illini\" to Carbondale to replace the \"Shawnee\", which had been canceled because of budget cuts. Service began at Gilman on October 26, 1986 and Du Quoin on August 25, 1989. The \"Illini\" service was nearly canceled in 1996, but local communities along the route pledged funds to keep it running.\n\nA second train, the \"Saluki\", was added on October 30, 2006, in response to increased demand on the \"Illini\" and other Illinois Service trains in the 2005–2006 fiscal year. The \"Saluki\" was named for the mascot of Southern Illinois University, which is located in the train's southern terminus of Carbondale. Its daytime schedule complements the afternoon schedule of the \"Illini.\"\n\nAmtrak ran an extra over the route, the Eclipse Express, for the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. \n\nThe trains have stops near three major Illinois state universities: UI, SIU, and Eastern Illinois University in Charleston (near Mattoon). As a result, university students account for a significant portion of passengers.\n\nThe \"Illini\" and \"Saluki\" operates over the Canadian National Railway, successor to the Illinois Central. The route is long.\n\nThe Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) is in the preliminary design phase for the Grand Crossing Project. This project will reroute the \"Illini\", \"Saluki\", and \"City of New Orleans\" trains from Canadian National Railway's tracks to Norfolk Southern's Chicago Line in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood in Chicago. This will eliminate a time-consuming switchback on the St. Charles Air Line into Chicago Union Station.\n\nIn 2010 a typical \"Illini\" or \"Saluki\" consists of:\n\n"}

The song appeared on the band's first full-length studio album, \"Surfer Rosa\", released in 1988. One of the longest songs on the album, \"Gigantic\" was released as the band's first single later that year.\n\nFeaturing Deal on lead vocals, the song is one of Pixies' biggest hits and a crowd favorite at concerts, often played as the encore. The melody line comes from Deal's simple but effective bass playing—the same bassline is repeated throughout the song.\n\n\"Gigantic\" never achieved a ranking on any major charts and was their only release from \"Surfer Rosa\". However, it was a fairly successful first hit for Pixies and maintains radio play to this day. The single version of the song appeared on Pixies' 2004 best-of compilation, \"\".\n\nAccording to Deal, the main inspiration for the song was the film \"Crimes of the Heart\", in which a white married woman falls in love with a black teenager and the song \"Gigantic\" is credited to Mrs John Murphy (Kim Deal's pseudonym at the time of \"Come On Pilgrim\" and \"Surfer Rosa\").\n\nThe song's voyeuristic lyrics mostly revolve around a woman's observation of an attractive black man making love to another woman, culminating in the oddly light-hearted but sexual chorus: \"Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic / A big, big love\". Francis later commented on the title of the song and the chorus (in the music magazine \"SELECT\"), saying:\n\n\"A good chord progression, very Lou Reed influenced. I'd had the word 'gigantic' in my mind just because the chord progression seemed very big to me.\"\n\nThe melody, particularly at the beginning, differs between the album and EP version.\n\n4AD label executive Ivo Watts-Russell didn't believe there was a track on \"Surfer Rosa\" that would get much radio play, so he approached producer Gil Norton to re-record \"Gigantic\" and \"River Euphrates\" with the intention of releasing them as the band's first single. It would be the first time Norton would record with the Pixies, and the circumstances made him a bit nervous because he was a fan of the band and Steve Albini's work. Most of the changes he made would be in the way the recordings were mixed while minor alterations were made in \"Gigantic\"'s arrangement. The single was released in the United Kingdom on 4AD as a 12-inch Vinyl Record and on CD. The CD version was re-issued in 1999. (No version of this single was ever released in the United States.) The single would also include a live version of \"Vamos\" (a song that also appeared on mini-LP, \"Come On Pilgrim\" and their first LP \"Surfer Rosa\") and a live cover of the song \"In Heaven (The Lady in The Radiator Song)\" from the David Lynch movie \"Eraserhead\", both recorded at the Town and Country Club in London. \n\nBased on the results of this re-recording, Gil Norton would be asked to produce the next album, \"Doolittle\". The back cover of the 12 inch features a large leather glove.\n\n\n"}

Like ultimate, the object of the game is to score points by passing the disc into the end zone; however, in Hot Box there is generally only one end zone and it is of much smaller size than an Ultimate end zone. In this way, hot box is a \"half-court\" variant of ultimate. Because of these reduced requirements, it is often played when not enough players are available to play ultimate.\n\nFor the most part, hot box follows the rules of play of ultimate. The major differences are:\n\nMany variations on the rules of hot box exist. Common variants include changing the dimensions of the field, using a circle instead of a square for the clear line, a stall count of 5 or 7 (instead of 10), and a \"no poaching\" clause which prevents defenders from guarding the endzone instead of their assigned player.\n\nSome variant games also exist. Double box involves a short rectangular field with two small end zones rather than one; there is no clearing line, but when a team gains possession of the disc after a turnover they must attack the end zone that their opponents were not. A variant originated in Washington, DC, Boot-Box, combines Double box with the cone hitting game, Durango Boot. Two end zones are formed with a square of four cones. Before scoring a team must complete a pass across a mid line. They can then score at either end zone. One point is scored for each cone knocked over. Catching a disc and landing in an end zone scores 3 points. Games are played to 15. Invalidimate was developed in the UK as a way to include injured players in practice; the \"invalid\" stands in the goal and is the target receiver for both teams. Two invalids can also be used in double box, with the additional rule that every player on a team must touch the disc (including the defensive invalid) before the offensive invalid can catch a scoring throw.\n\nA drinking variation called Beer Box was invented at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. Beer Box is similar to the original half-court Box with one larger square and an inner, smaller endzone square, but this game also includes drinking cans of alcohol throughout the course of the game. For setup, the outer square is 15 yards wide on each side and the inner endzone square is 2 yard on each side. For each outer cone, a can of alcohol is placed underneath. Once any player with the disc is within reach of an outer cone, play is paused momentarily as said player is allowed to drink for 3 counts. After 3 counts, the can is placed back under the cone and play resumes. If the offensive player finishes the can at any point during the game, the marking defender must remove themselves from the game and complete a task, creating a power play for the offensive team. Once the marking defender performs a task by the designated Task Master and replaces the empty can with a brand new one, that player may enter the field of play. Similar to standard box, a goal is scored once the offensive team caught a pass in the endzone. However, once a goal is scored, play is paused while the defender guarding the scoring receiver must drink for 10 counts from the designated side beer area.\n"}

He was beheaded for his involvement in the notional Southampton Plot to assassinate the king. Some historians believe that the charge was trumped-up to punish him for other acts of disloyalty, and that there may never have been such a plot.\n\nHenry Scrope, born about 1373, In his inquisitions \"post mortem\" he is variously described as being aged 30 to 33 \"years and more\" at his father's death in 1406. Using the former age, dates Scrope's birth to c. 1376, while rounds it to c. 1370 and dates it to c. 1378.</ref> was the eldest son and heir of Stephen Scrope (c.1345 – 25 January 1406), 2nd Baron Scrope of Masham, and Margery Welles, widow of John de Huntingfield.. He had four brothers, and one sister:\n\nIn 1390 Scrope accompanied John Beaufort, half-brother of the future King Henry IV, on the Barbary Crusade to Mahdia, but otherwise little is known of his early life. An annuity granted to him by King Richard II was continued by Henry IV after Richard's deposition, and in 1403 Scrope was styled 'king's knight', and fought on Henry IV's side at the Battle of Shrewsbury. His uncle, Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York, was executed on 8 June 1405 for taking part in the Northern Rising against the King; however Henry Scrope was not involved in his uncle's failed rebellion, and was serving the King in Wales when he inherited his father's title and lands in 1406. In 1408 he accompanied Henry IV's daughter, Philippa, to Denmark for her marriage, and in 1409 went to Paris on a diplomatic mission with Henry IV's half-brother, Henry Beaufort.\n\nAccording to Tait, it was during this period that Scrope came to enjoy the friendship and confidence of the future Henry V, by whose influence he was appointed Treasurer of England in 1410, and made a Knight of the Garter in the same year.\n\nHenry V succeeded his father in 1413, and in 1413 Scrope was sent on several diplomatic missions. In 1414 he accompanied Bishop Henry Chichele to Burgundy to negotiate an alliance.\n\nIn 1415 Henry V determined to invade France, and in February 1415 Scrope attended a council meeting held for the purpose of planning the forthcoming expedition. However, on 27 May 1415 Scrope was absent from the council meeting for no apparent reason. On 31 July Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March informed King Henry that he had just become aware of a plot to murder Henry and put himself on the throne.\n\nMortimer was the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, second surviving son of King Edward III, and his claim to the throne was thus superior to that of Henry V and his father, Henry IV, who derived their claim from Henry IV's father, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, third surviving son of Edward III. Moreover, Edmund Mortimer's father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, had been widely considered heir presumptive to King Richard II, who had no issue, and Edmund Mortimer himself had been heir presumptive to Richard II while a young child.\n\nThe three ringleaders of the plot were Edmund Mortimer's brother-in-law (and Scrope's wife Joan's stepson), Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge, Sir Thomas Grey, whose son, Thomas, had been betrothed in 1412 to Cambridge's only daughter, Isabel and Scrope himself.\n\nRichard, Scrope, and Grey were promptly arrested. The trial took place in Southampton, on the site now occupied by the Red Lion Inn. Grey was beheaded on 2 August 1415. The most degrading punishment was reserved for Scrope, perhaps because he had been a royal favourite. Prior to his execution, Scrope was dragged across Southampton from the Watergate to the north gate, where he and Cambridge were beheaded on 5 August 1415. Scrope's head was sent to York, to be put on a spike on Micklegate Bar.\n\nScrope's involvement in the conspiracy surprised contemporaries, and continues to puzzle historians. Ian Mortimer claims Scrope had merely insinuated himself into the confidence of Cambridge and Grey in order to betray the conspiracy, just as Edward, Duke of York had done with the Epiphany Rising in 1400, but was forestalled by Edmund Mortimer's revelation of the conspiracy to the King on 31 July. Pugh, however, finds Scrope's exculpatory statements at trial unconvincing, and states that Scrope never pretended that he had intended to inform the King of the conspiracy. Pugh also contends that \"there was no plot in 1415 to assassinate Henry V and his three brothers and that heinous charge, by far the most sensational in the indictment, was fabricated to ensure that Cambridge, Grey and Scrope did not escape the death penalty as a well-deserved punishment for the various other offences that they undoubtedly had committed\".\n\nThe Southampton Plot is dramatized in Shakespeare's \"Henry V\", and in the anonymous play, \"The History of Sir John Oldcastle\".\n\nScrope married firstly, before 5 February 1398, Philippe Bryan (d. 19 November 1406), the widow of Sir John Devereux (d. 13 November 1396), and daughter and co-heiress of Guy de Bryan, 1st Baron Bryan.\n\nHe married secondly, by licence dated 6 September 1410, Lady Joan Holland (d.1434), the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Alice FitzAlan, and widow firstly of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and secondly, William Willoughby, 5th Lord Willoughby. Joan's paternal grandparents were Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and Joan of Kent, mother of King Richard II by her second marriage to Edward, the Black Prince. Joan's father was thus a halfbrother of King Richard II.\n\nJoan was the sister of Eleanor Holland, Countess of March, mother of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, who was the focus of the Southampton Plot.\n\nAfter Scrope's death. Joan married fourthly, Henry Bromflete, Baron Vescy.\n\nScrope had no issue by either of his wives, and was succeeded by his brother, John Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Masham, who did not recover the forfeited Scrope lands until 1442.\n\n\n"}

After graduating from Akron East High School in Akron, Ohio, he went to Kent State University where he played college baseball and college basketball for the Kent State Golden Flashes.\n\nHe spent one season (1966-67) playing professional basketball for the Columbus Comets of the North American Basketball League.\n\nAfter being signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1959, Michael made his major league debut with the Pirates in 1966. As a player, Michael earned the nickname \"Stick\" due to his slender frame.\n\nThe following year, the Pirates traded Michael to the Los Angeles Dodgers with Bob Bailey for Maury Wills. He spent one season in Los Angeles, and was then purchased by the New York Yankees. He played for the Yankees from 1968 until 1974. The Yankees released Michael before the 1975 season, after which he signed with the Detroit Tigers. Michael then signed with the Boston Red Sox in 1976, though did not play in a single game with Boston, having been released in May without using him once. He retired with a .229 batting average, 15 home runs, and 226 runs batted in in 973 games played. Michael was a master of the hidden ball trick, having pulled it off five times in his career.\n\nWeeks after his release from Boston, Michael became a coach with the Yankees. Reggie Jackson credited Michael's scouting reports for helping him hit those three home runs in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. He served as manager of the Yankees Triple-A team in 1979, and as general manager of the Yankees in 1980. Michael then served as the Yankees' manager in 1981 and again in 1982. At one point in the 1981 season, annoyed by George Steinbrenner's constant interference, he challenged the Yankees owner to fire him, which he did. Michael finished with a record of 92 wins and 76 losses over both stints as Yankees manager. Michael returned to the Yankees front office in 1983, and again served as a coach starting in 1984. He next managed the Chicago Cubs in 1986 and 1987. His managerial record with the Chicago Cubs was 114 wins and 124 losses.\nIn 1990, Michael was again hired, this time as general manager of the Yankees. At a time when Steinbrenner was suspended from baseball operations by Commissioner Fay Vincent, Michael took advantage of his newfound managerial flexibility by rebuilding the Yankees farm system, in developing young talent rather than trading it away, as they had done in the 1980s with little success. During Michael's tenure as general manager, the Yankees drafted or signed such notable players as Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada (collectively known as the Core Four), and others. Further, he traded for Paul O'Neill. Michael also demonstrated patience with Bernie Williams, whom Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had wanted to trade when he struggled early in his career.\n\nThis foundation paid off with Yankees championships in 1996, and from 1998–2000. However Michael was fired in 1995, before the Yankees dynasty began to win World Series, as a result of fallouts from the 1994 strike, which ended the Yankees chance of having the best record in the American League that year. It was the second time the Yankees fired Michael as a result of a strike; in 1981, he was fired as manager as a result of the team slumping after the 1981 strike.\n\nFrom 1996 until 2002, Michael served as vice-president of major league scouting for the Yankees. In 2002, the Boston Red Sox tried to talk to Michael about their general manager position, but were not given permission by the Yankees. In 2003, Michael was promoted to vice-president and senior advisor. He held that position until his death.\n\nDuring his time as Vice President, Michael was a regular attendee at the annual Old Timers Day festivities, where he served as the manager for both the Bombers and the Clippers teams in the exhibition game.\n\nDuring his tenure with the Yankees, Michael had been a resident of Norwood, New Jersey, and had four children. He married twice, his first marriage to Rae Reuter, ending in divorce. \n\nMichael died due to a heart attack on September 7, 2017, in Oldsmar, Florida, at age 79. Survivors at the time of his death include his second wife and four children. To honor Michael, the Yankees wore black armbands on their uniforms for the remainder of the 2017 season.\n"}

Armed with temporary superhero abilities that need to be replenished with additional super carrots, Bugs remembers a newspaper article about Texas hunter \"Cottontail\" Smith, who wants to hunt down all rabbits.\n\nBugs flies to Deepinaharta, Texas, and assumes the moniker of a mild-mannered forest creature, complete with oversized glasses and hat. He encounters Smith, who attempts to shoot Bugs, only for the bullets to form an outline of Bugs before harmlessly falling to the ground. Bugs then hands Smith a cannon, eats another carrot then, upon being struck by the cannonball, plays basketball with it, quickly shoving Smith and his horse onto bleachers while he acts as his own cheerleader. After Bugs returns to the air, the bemused Smith and his horse fly into the sky with their own airplane. Bugs then snatches the shell of the plane away from them, plunging them to the ground.\n\nBugs runs out of power, but when he tries to recharge again, his carrots fall to the ground. When Bugs lands, he opens his eyes to see a line of chewed-up carrots eaten by Smith and his horse-turned-Superhero. Bugs turns to the camera and says \"This looks like a job for a \"REAL\" Superman!\" He ducks into a phone booth. Both Smith and the horse are ready to attack - until the booth opens and they both snap to attention and salute. Bugs marches out in a Marine uniform, singing the \"Marines' Hymn.\" He dismisses the two, claiming he has \"\"important\" work to do!\", and marches off to \"Berlin, Tokyo and points East.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps were so thrilled that Bugs Bunny decided to become a Marine in this cartoon that they insisted the character be officially inducted into the force as a private, which was done, complete with dogtags. The character was regularly promoted until Bugs was officially \"discharged\" at the end of World War II as a Master Sergeant.\n\nCottontail Smith later appears as one of Yosemite Sam’s sidekicks in \"\". The character’s voice is a less raucous version of Sam’s and Foghorn Leghorn’s.\n\nThe short parodies the Superman animated series as a figure soars across the sky from random directions. Onlookers are heard speculating on its nature: \"Look! Up there in the sky\" \"It’s a boid\" [bird], \"Nah, it ain’t a boid, it’s a dive-bommah\".\n\nA Marine is described as \"a real superman\" by Bugs.\n\n\n\n"}

There were 4,842 people enrolled within the electorate as of 2011.\n\nMacDonnell was generally a safe seat for the Labor Party, due to its large indigenous population, but there have been three exceptions: from 1974 to 1977 (when there were no ALP members in the Assembly); from 1997 to 2005, when several factors helped deliver the seat to the Country Liberal Party candidate, who then managed to use his incumbency to his advantage and thus retain the seat at the following election. It was easily regained by the ALP at the 2005 election, amidst a territory-wide landslide result and a particularly strong candidate in former ATSIC Central Zone Commissioner Alison Anderson, ultimately sweeping Elferink away with an electoral swing of more than 30 per cent, however in 2009, Anderson resigned from the ALP, and joined the CLP in 2011.\n\nIn a redistribution conducted prior to the 2012 Northern Territory election, MacDonnell was abolished and was renamed Namatjira, after the artist Albert Namatjira.\n"}

Originally intended as a sports bike to compete with the Suzuki GSX-R750 and Yamaha FZ750 it was reassigned to a sports tourer with its replacement in racing by the Honda VFR750R followed by the introduction of the more rounded 1990 VFR750FL. It was fully faired and Honda claimed from the liquid-cooled double overhead cam (DOHC) V4 four-stroke engine. All generations of VFR750F since 1990 had an Elf-designed pro-arm single-sided rear swingarm, and since 1986 had durable, gear-driven cams.\n\nThe original VFR750F was first introduced to journalists after the 1985 Bol d'Or, and launched at Jerez, Spain. Introduced for 1986 as a complete redesign of the VF700/750F models in order to address some of the camshaft and bearing problems that had become associated with the first-generation Honda V4 engines, and to improve Honda's negative image concerning this engine. Compared to the VF750F, the new VFR750F had greater power output (104 hp up from 83 hp), lighter weight (claimed 20 kg), a lower centre of gravity, a wider front tyre, a slightly shorter wheelbase (15mm) gear driven cams and six rather than five gears.\n\n\"Tariff buster\" 700 cc versions (VFR700F) of the first-generation bike were available alongside 750 cc versions in the US market, due to the tax laws in place at the time that penalised large-displacement imported motorcycles (in order to protect the troubled Harley Davidson Motor Company).\n\nIn the Japanese domestic market there were other VFR750F variants:\n\n\nAlthough not designed as a race bike, in 1986 British racer Ron Haslam took a standard VFR750F to third place in a soaked Transatlantic Challenge race at Donington Park, UK.\n\nA special VFR750F called the '6X', a 135 hp@13000RPM 188 mph full HRC prototype using RVF cycle parts and containing titanium valves, magnesium cases and flat-slide carburettors, weighing (dry), less than the factory RVF that was first ridden by Wayne Gardner at a Suzuka test against TT F1 machinery. Wayne broke his four-stroke lap record by 1.5 seconds. Six examples of the '6X' were built, 4 for the Domestic Championships and two for the American Championships.\n\nThe VFR '6X' was raced at the Isle of Man TT by Geoff Johnson, coming in 2nd to Joey Dunlop in both the F1 and Senior TT.\n\nIn the US Fred Merkel and Wayne Rainey contested the 1986 AMA Camel Pro Championship, which at the time had both Superbike and F1 races but only one championship, with the best finish of the day counting. Merkel just rode in the Superbike while Rainey did the F1 as well. Merkel won two races and Rainey seven, but the championship was won by Merkel by two points.\n\nFor 1987 Merkel's bike was passed to Bubba Shobert who took 3rd place in 1987, being beaten by Wayne Rainey and Kevin Schwantz. The points he earned during the 1987 season gained him victory in the AMA Grand National. In 1988 Shobert won three of the seven races to win the AMA superbike championship.\n\nThe engine developed in the 6X became the basis for the factory racer, the VFR750R. A race kit was available for the 1986-87 VFR from HRC for US$4,000, this including a titanium exhaust and was known as the VFR750RK.\n\nThe VFR750F models all used 748 cc 16-valve gear driven DOHC liquid-cooled 90° V4 engines with carburettor-based air/fuel induction; the bore × stroke remained the same for all 750 models at . The engine was made of cast aluminium alloy with the crankcase being divided horizontally, VFR750P and VFR750K models use slightly different crankcases with the lower casing being modified to allow for the gear position indicator in place of the neutral switch. On all the VFR750 models the gear drive for the cams was between the cylinders. Lubrication was via a wet sump with a chain-driven, dual-rotor oil pump; an oil (air) cooler was also fitted. The transmission was a 6-speed, with a constant-mesh, wet multi-plate clutch and chain drive to the rear wheel with the exception of the 5-speed VFR750P which had a spacer in place of one of the gears.\n\nThe VFR750F uses a 180° crankshaft, instead of the 360° crankshaft used in the VF and VFR750R.\n\nIn comparison to the VF750 almost every component had weight shaved off it, each connecting rod lost , rocker arms , intake valve , exhaust valves , pistons , piston rings per set, valve springs each.\n\nThe V4 engine has proven itself highly reliable, with few known faults. The gear-driven camshaft system removed any lingering concerns about cam-chain maintenance, which had dogged the VF-series of Honda V4 engines. Valve adjustment on first-generation VFR750Fs was by screw and locknut, which changed in 1990 to shim-under-bucket, along with the valve-clearance inspection interval to . However, RC36 engines have been known to reach well over without any need to adjust the valve clearances.\n\nThe 1986 VFR750F used what Honda call a diamond type frame, this is because the engine is \"set\" in the frame like a precious stone is set in jewellery. This design of frame is now referred to as a twin spar. The 1986 VFR750F frame uses the engine as a stressed member and has a cast aluminium headstock joined via extrusions to the rear castings. The downtubes are . The VFR750F was the first of the 750 class to have an aluminium twin spar frame, weighing just and the nearest thing on the road to the VFR, the GSX-R also had an aluminium frame but it was of a conventional twin cradle design.\n\nFirst-generation VFR750Fs sported anti-dive (adjustable on some models) on the damping-rod front Showa forks (uprated to for 1988) and a conventional, dual-sided aluminium swingarm with a centrally located Showa damping unit with remote hydraulic pre-load adjustment at the rear and a pro-link suspension linkage.\n\nSecond-generation models had non-adjustable cartridge-style Showa front forks, coupled with a remotely adjustable (for pre-load) emulsion-type Showa shock absorber and the trademark single-sided swing arm. Honda soon upgraded the VFR750F's suspension to include pre-load adjustment on the forks, and damping adjustment on the shock. The bike's distinctive swing arm, derived from the Elf-designed race-bike Pro-Arm development work, has the advantage of allowing rear-wheel removal without the need to remove the drive chain or rear axle, and allows chain adjustment to be made very simply with no concerns of altering wheel alignment.\n\nThird-generation VFR750Fs continued to use the same basic suspension components as the VFR750FN/P, though the single-sided swing arm was redesigned to reduce weight.\n\nThe VFR750F can be divided into three distinct generations, with significant revisions having taken place upon the introduction of the VFR750FL in 1990 and the VFR750FR in 1994. The VFR750F ceased production in 1997 with the introduction of the VFR800Fi, marketed in the US as the \"Interceptor\" and in the UK as the \"VFR\".\n\nNew model based on a complete redesign of the VF750F, full fairing, alloy twin-spar frame, gear-driven camshafts, and 16 inch front and 18 inch rear wheels. The VFR750FG also had a cam sensor which was omitted from all later versions. US and Canada models had round gauges while all other models had square gauges.\n\nThe \"Tariff Buster\" 700cc VFR700F was almost identical to the 750cc version with minor changes to graphics (no 750 on the lower fairing), shorter stroke, different cams and ignition timing. The VFR700F2 was mechanically the same as the standard F but had an upgraded rear shock and fork internals alongside square gauges.\n\nNot to be confused with the VFR750R (RC30) the VFR750RK was the HRC race kitted version of the VFR750F. Designed for TT F1 and Endurance racing as well as AMA Superbike. The kit bumped the claimed power output from 105PS@10500 rpm to 125PS@12000 rpm due to engine changes including new titanium rods (steel for AMA), pistons (raising compression to 11:1) and cams with larger (optional titanium for the inlet) valves. A new ECU bumped the ignition advance by 5°. Depending on year either the original carbs were modified or a new set were offered as an option.\nAs well as the engine parts the kit options included a new radiator and optional secondary radiator, modified bodywork, wider wheels, new suspension (forks, shock and linkage) and the option for bars (replacing the clip-ons).\n\nMinor revision with fairing redesign from a two piece to three piece along with 2-position flip up screen, exhaust redesign, stronger fork legs (up to 41mm from 37mm) but retaining anti-dive on the left leg, a more reliable ignition system and 17 inch wheels front and rear. Larger engine valves for improved midrange along with larger carbs. Gear ratios remain the same but the gearbox shift mechanism was upgraded to the same as the VFR750R (RC30).\n\nA clock and fuel gauge were added and the pillion footrest mounts were changed from being part of the rear subframe to bolt on cast aluminium assemblies. New larger frame castings reduced the amount of frame welding. New fairing side-panels allowed easier access to the engine, and the fairing cutaways for the rider's feet were much reduced in area. The change in wheel size allowed both a greater range of tyre options and a claimed improvement in handling. This model was not imported into the US.\n\nModel year 1990 saw a major redesign in the RC36 version. The forks now featured cartridge dampers, wheels were widened to 5.5 inch for wider tires, and the frame newly constructed. A single sided swingarm allowed for a narrow tail that could accommodate saddle bags while still offering comfort for a passenger. Alas, it also increased the weight by 17 kg.\n\nWhile keeping the RC36 model number and basic technical layout Honda changed around 200 parts in 1994. Among them were different brakes and riding position, a rear shock absorber with adjustable rebound damping and the tank capacity increased from 5 to 5.5 gal (19 to 21 l). The new model weighed 6 kg less. It was the last of the VFR750F models before the introduction of the VFR800Fi with 781 cc and fuel injection in 1998.Front fairing and lamp were designed similar to the NR 750, as Honda pointed out in advertising.\n\nRelated models include the VFR400R (NC30), RVF400R (NC35), VF1000F/VF1000R (SC15/16/19/20), VFR750R (RC30), RVF750R (RC45), NR750 (RC40) and VFR800Fi (RC46).\n\n"}

His mother was Katherine Lindsay, daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick, Perthshire, and a niece of the first Lord Mansfield. His brother was William Murray of Henderland FRSE.\n\nMurray was educated successively at the Edinburgh High School, at Westminster School, and at the University of Edinburgh. \nAt Edinburgh he was a member of the Juvenile Literary Society, of which Henry Brougham and Francis Horner were the leading spirits, and of the Speculative Society. He corresponded with Horner, till the latter's death in 1817, and his letters form a major part of the \"Memoirs of Horner,\" 1843.\n\nIn 1799, Murray passed to the Scottish bar. When the \"Edinburgh Review\" was founded, Sydney Smith, Horner, Francis Jeffrey, Thomas, and he, met for a time as joint editors in Jeffrey's house. He continued as contributor. \nHis early career at the bar was distinguished, but he had no need to develop it further.\n\nA liberal, Murray threw in his lot with the young Edinburgh Whig lawyers, and took part in the agitation before the Reform Bill of 1832. In December 1832, he was returned unopposed for Leith Burghs, which had been enfranchised under the bill. He was appointed recorder of the great roll and clerk of the pipe, a sinecure in the Scottish exchequer which he did not long hold.\n\nOn the elevation of Jeffrey to the bench in 1835, Murray succeeded him as Lord Advocate. He introduced a large number of bills into the House of Commons, including measures for the reform of the universities, for giving popular magistracies to small towns, for enabling sheriffs to hold small debt circuits, for the reform of the court of session, and for amending the bankruptcy law, but only succeeded in carrying a few minor reforms. In 1839, he was savagely attacked in parliament by his old friend Brougham for his conduct in the case of five cotton-spinners who were tried on a charge of murder arising out of a trade-union dispute. He answered the charges in the House of Commons.\n\nMurray in 1839 left parliament for the Court of Session. He was knighted that year, adopting the courtesy title Lord Murray.\n\nIn 1844 Murray was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Thomas Stewart Traill. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1849 to 1857.\n\nHe remained on the bench till his death at his house 11 Great Stuart Street on the Moray Estate in Edinburgh on 7 March 1859.

At the 2010 census, it had a population of 315. The area is rural desert along the Mexican border near the eastern extent of San Diego County.\n\nThe Boulevard area encompasses the communities of Manzanita, Live Oak Springs and Tierra Del Sol. Nearby communities in the same wire center (central office) for wired telephones include: Calexico Lodge, Jacumba, Live Oak Springs, Manzanita, Pueblo Siding, and Tierra del Sol. Default wired telephone numbers for this area follow the format (619) 766-xxxx. The ZIP code is 91905.\n\nThe Kumeyaay and Cocopah Indians were Boulevard's earliest inhabitants, and the area is rich in Native American history, culture and archeological resources. Today Boulevard is the headquarters of the Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians.\n\nAn area near Calexico Lodge is occasionally referred to as Eckener Pass. Reportedly, this is a reference to German Zeppelin pioneer Hugo Eckener. In August 1929, Hugo Eckener's Zeppelin Z-127 \"Graf Zeppelin\", a sister ship of the Hindenburg, landed here on the Los Angeles-Chicago leg of her round-the-world tour.\n\nThe town and post office were named Boulevard after US Highway 80 which ran through town. Eventually Interstate 8 was constructed, bypassing the town. Local residents report an alternate version of the origin of the name. Boulevard used to be a stage coach stop, reportedly near today's McCain Valley road, east of today's core of Boulevard. Coming from Arizona, this stop was on the first long, flat straight stretch of road, \"a boulevard\", after climbing the winding In-Ko-Pah mountains and passing through windier roads in Jacumba.\n\nIn January 2007, the La Posta Casino, owned and operated by the La Posta Band of Mission Indians, opened. It was the smallest casino in the county until it closed in 2012 due to its financial situation.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 3.9 square miles (10.1 km²), all land. However, this only includes the village area of Boulevard. More commonly, Boulevard includes rural outlying areas. The Boulevard Community Planning Group includes approximately 55,350 acres, or about 86 square miles.\n\nLocated in the East County section of San Diego County, Boulevard with its unique transitional location straddles the Tecate Divide, between the Laguna Mountains above and the desert below, providing views of the surrounding Laguna, In-Ko-Pah and Sierra de Juarez mountains.\n\nThe community is south of Interstate 8 about west of El Centro. The US Post Office is plotted at although the actual post office has since moved approximately two miles west near the separation of Old Highway 80 and State Route 94. The post office, and the community it serves, has the ZIP Code 91905.\n\nRegulatory filings show a California Department of Transportation facility described as a highway maintenance station in Boulevard. It is located in the 40000-block of Old Highway 80 on the south side at as of 1993, and still exists as of 2018.\n\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Boulevard has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Boulevard had a population of 315. However, other sources report a population of more than 2000. The discrepancy is likely due to exactly which areas are included in the unincorporated area. The population density was 80.7 people per square mile (31.2/km²). The racial makeup of Boulevard was 272 (86.3%) White, 2 (0.6%) African American, 7 (2.2%) Native American, 3 (1.0%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 14 (4.4%) from other races, and 17 (5.4%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 44 persons (14.0%).\n\nThe Census reported that 315 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized. However, Boulevard does have a prison facility, the McCain Valley Conservation Camp, as well as a border patrol facility with detention space.\n\nThere were 135 households, out of which 35 (25.9%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 66 (48.9%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 12 (8.9%) had a female householder with no husband present, 5 (3.7%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 7 (5.2%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 1 (0.7%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 46 households (34.1%) were made up of individuals and 17 (12.6%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33. There were 83 families (61.5% of all households); the average family size was 2.96.\n\nThe population was spread out with 71 people (22.5%) under the age of 18, 9 people (2.9%) aged 18 to 24, 59 people (18.7%) aged 25 to 44, 123 people (39.0%) aged 45 to 64, and 53 people (16.8%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 49.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 114.3 males.

After 1854 he took the surname Maconochie-Welwood.\n\nMaconochie was born on 2 March 1777 in Midlothian, the eldest son of Elizabeth Welwood of Garvock and Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and probably at the University of Edinburgh. He was admitted as an advocate in 1799, and in 1800 admitted to the Highland Society.\n\nHe served as Sheriff of Haddington from 1810 and Solicitor General for Scotland from 1813, and as Lord Advocate from 1816 to 1819.\n\nIn keeping with his appointment as Lord Advocate, he was Member of Parliament for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, England, from 1817–1818, for the Kilrenny district of Anstruther Burghs from 1818 to 1819. He made his Parliamentary debut during a period of considerable unrest in both Scotland and England in 1817, choosing to mark it by announcing the existence of a seditious conspiracy of weavers in the suburbs of Glasgow. The ensuing prosecutions were spectacularly unsuccessful, however, and caused considerable embarrassment, both to the government and to Maconochie himself, who, as Lord Advocate, was directly responsible.\n\nIn 1817 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet, Thomas Allan, Sir David Brewster and Sir Henry Jardine. He served as a Councillor of the Society during 1822-5 (Literary section) and 1835–7.\n\nIn the 1830s, his address is listed as 13 Royal Circus Edinburgh's New Town.\n\nIn part because of his rather indifferent record, especially after further embarrassment in the Court of Session in 1819, he was appointed a lord of session and justiciary as \"Lord Meadowbank\" 1819, and resigned in 1843. With the same title as his father, he was subject of one of Scots law's better puns. When he quizzed one advocate as to the difference between 'likewise and also', he received the reply that just as his father had been Lord Meadowbank, so was he, 'also but not likewise'.\n\nHe assumed the additional surname of \"Welwood\" on succeeding to his cousin's estates in 1854.\n\nMaconochie-Welwood died on 30 November 1861 at Meadowbank House (now named Kirknewton House), Kirknewton, West Lothian, and was interred at a private burial ground at Meadowbank House.\n\nIn 1805 he married Anne Blair the daughter of Robert Blair, Lord Avontoun. The couple had children included Allan Alexander Maconochie FRSE (1806-1885).\n\nHis daughter Mary Anne Maconochie married Steuart Bayley Hare of Calderhall, father of Lt Col Hare.\n"}

The ship was laid down in 1955, launched 6 April 1959, and completed 7 July 1960. She was named after the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire.\n\nOn Tuesday 13 July 1965 she recommissioned in Singapore Dockyard under the command of Commander D C Nairne RN and served in the Far East during the Indonesian Conflict, she also visited Subic Bay during exercises with the US Navy and Hong Kong where she was guard ship. Returning to Singapore she sailed for Plymouth in 1966. \nIn October 1973 she took part in the Second Cod War under the command of Commander D Howard, and after being rammed in the stern during the first Cod war Commander Howard took steps to stop this happening again. This involved mounting two lengths of railway line protruding from the stern. This had the desired effect in protecting the stern of the ship. However, damage was caused to both port and starboard sides of the ship when the ship was positioned between a target trawler and the gunboat Aegir. After a successful deployment the ship returned to Chatham to undergo repairs.\n\nIn April 1974 HMS \"Lincoln\" was decommissioned at Chatham and placed in the reserve fleet. With the serious damage being suffered by British frigates in late 1975, due to aggressive ramming by Icelandic gunboats, in the Third Cod War in 1976, \"Lincoln\" received a short refit for patrol duties with improved wooden padding on the bow area for ramming reinforcement .It has been suggested, Lincoln was selected for this ramming role as it was the one Type 61, not fitted with hull stabilizer fins. She was engaged in sea trials before commencing active service, when settlement was reached over the fishing conflict.\n\nIn 1976 the New Zealand Government sought to purchase second hand Royal Navy to replace the RNZN Type 12 Taranaki, and HMS \"Lincoln\" was one of four RN frigates that was offered for sale. The New Zealand Government rejected the offer for \"Lincoln\", as her 174 Sonar had been removed and could not easily be refitted. Remaining in British service, \"Lincoln\" carried out a tour of duty in the Arctic Circle and served as the guard ship in Gibraltar during late 1976. She was finally returned to the standby squadron in Chatham in December 1977. She was proposed for sale to Egypt in 1978, but that deal also did not proceed.\n\nIn 1979 \"Lincoln\" served her final active commission as a training ship for submarine engineers, as her engines were akin to those aboard the Oberon-class submarine. She was also used in Arctic waters alongside HMS \"Bulwark\", to provide radar cover for the initial sea trials of the Sea Harrier aircraft. \"Lincoln\"s 966 and 986 radars were used in combination with \"Bulwark\"s 986 radar to provide tracking over Scandinavia. The 986 radar had been fitted to three Type 61s, \"Bulwark\" and \"Ark Royal\" in around 1970, as a partial replacement for the complex 984 3D radar previously fitted to the carriers. In 1981 \"Lincoln\" was unsuccessfully proposed for sale to the Bangladesh Navy.\n\n"}

On succeeding to the estate of Killermont upon the death of his father in 1804, he assumed the additional surname and arms of Colquhoun.\n\nHe was admitted an advocate in 1768 and appointed Sheriff of Perth from 1793 to 1807 and rector of Glasgow University from 1807 to 1809.\n\nOn the downfall of the ministry of All the Talents, he was appointed Lord Advocate on 28 March 1807.\nAt this time, most of the Scotch patronage was in the hands of the Dundas family, and William Erskine, Alexander Maconochie. and Henry Cockburn were actually chosen deputes by Lord Melville before Colquhoun had received the appointment. \n\nIn the following May, he was returned as Member of Parliament for the Elgin district of burghs, but after three years resigned his seat. In July 1810 he was elected member for Dumbartonshire, which county he continued to represent until his death in 1820.\n\nColquhoun, as the Lord Advocate, took part in reforming the constitution of the Court of Session, and was appointed one of the thirteen commissioners who sat for the first time on 30 November 1808 for the purpose of inquiring into the administration of justice in Scotland. \nThe correspondence between him and Erskine, the late lord advocate, on the subject of the respective merits of Lord Grenville's and Lord Eldon's bills for the reform of legal procedure will be found in the 'Scots Magazine' for 1808, pp. 70–2, 149–52. \nOn the death of Lord Frederick Campbell, Colquhoun was appointed Lord Clerk Register, on 4 July 1816, much to the disappointment of Erskine's friends, who had hoped that the post would have been offered to him.\nHe was a partner in the Thistle Bank of Glasgow.\n\nColquhoun died on 8 December 1820, after an illness of a few days, at the house of his son-in-law, Walter Long, at Hartham, Wiltshire, and was buried in the parish churchyard of New Kilpatrick near Glasgow. \n\nIn 1796 he married Mary Ann, daughter of the Rev.

It is located just west of the Sacramento River in the eastern portion of the county. Broderick's ZIP Code is 95605 and is in area codes 916 and 279. It lies at an elevation of 23 feet (7 m).\n\nWashington was rumored to be named after George Washington because the town plan was filed by Margaret McDowell on Washington's birthday. Margaret McDowell's first husband, James McDowell, settled and developed of land on a rancho he purchased from John Schwartz in 1846. He was killed in the Spring of 1849 in a saloon brawl, leaving his wife a widow.\n\nMargaret McDowell was left with five children, a house and a garden. She had taken in boarders as a means of income, but found she needed to do something else to remain financially able. In August 1849 she hired a surveyor to map that was adjoined to her garden. In October of that year she established the boundaries of her property and created a town plat of 41 blocks which she named Washington. She sold several lots during the next few years, but Washington's plat was not officially recorded and the town was called by other names including \"Margeretta\" and \"West Sacramento\".\n\nIn 1850 there were approximately 300 people residing in Washington. During the summer of 1851 the county seat was relocated from Fremont to Washington because of the severe flooding that Fremont had experienced the winter before. It now seemed that Washington had the potential to become comparable to its \"booming\" sister city, Sacramento on the opposite side of the river.\n\nA post office was established in April 1854 but the building burnt down in 1856 and to the dismay of the residents, a post office was never reconstructed and they had to go to Sacramento to get their mail for the next 33 years.\n\nThe Washington Public School District was organized in 1856, and the land was donated by Margaret McDowell, now married to Dr. Enos C. Taylor, her third husband, and renamed Mrs. Margaret Taylor. The school district still serves West Sacramento, and built three local schools within the first decade of its existence.\n\nLocal flooding that had occurred almost annually had alarmed Yolo County residents who voted to move the county seat to Cacheville (now Yolo) in 1857. However, residents disliked their choice because Cacheville was so isolated and small, and moved the county seat back to Washington. Unfortunately the weather proved disastrous in the winter of 1861-62, and in 1862 the voters held a special election to vote a permanent county seat. The county seat was elected to be Woodland to the dislike of Washingtonians. Another heavy blow to the already downtrodden Washington residents was the completion of a bridge to Sacramento located roughly where the I Street Bridge is located today. Travelers coming from the Bay Area now had no reason to stop in Washington on their way to Sacramento. There was no need to use the local ferries because the toll bridge was cheaper.\n\nEconomic optimism increased in Washington when the California Pacific Railroad reached the town in November 1868, and Washington was the railhead of the line that started in Vallejo. The outcome wasn't quite as hoped for. Property values did not increase, and had actually decreased in comparison to the Gold Rush days. In addition to that, a new junction was completed in Davisville (now Davis) that headed towards Woodland, diverting rail traffic from Washington. Furthermore, in 1870 Cal-P reconstructed the I Street Bridge to withstand the weight of rail cars, so the rail line could reach Sacramento.\n\nIn 1871 what is modern day Downtown Sacramento raised its buildings nine feet and reinforced the levees on its side of the Sacramento River to withstand the annual flooding. The unincorporated town of Washington could not afford to properly engineer well-protected levees nor raise the whole town, so each year they would fix their levees and endure any flooding that would occur.\n\nThe town was renamed in the late 1800s in honor of the anti-slavery advocate and United States Senator David C. Broderick.\n\nA new post office was established in 1893, and operated until 1909 with a brief closure in 1895 to 1896.\n\nThe largest employer in Broderick is the California State Teachers Retirement System, which built its headquarters on the waterfront. The Ziggurat building, originally built as the corporate headquarters for The Money Store and now home to the State Department of General Services, sits at the edge of the area.\n\nThe neighborhood's iconic restaurant is Sal's Tacos, known for its mosaic tile decor. In 2012, Broderick Restaurant and Bar opened.\n\n\n\n"}

The Argentines set up a military base on Thule. It is likely, according to the Foreign Office, that the prompt action prevented a more serious attack. The force planned under heavy security was commanded by Hugh Balfour and consisted of the nuclear submarine \"Dreadnought\", two frigates, \"Alacrity\" and \"Phoebe\", and the auxiliaries \"Resurgent\" and \"Olwen\" as support vessels. The Argentines rapidly became aware of the taskforce's presence, but their forces remained on Thule and Callaghan decided against the use of force to evict them.\n\nThe foreign secretary at the time David Owen later claimed that if Margaret Thatcher's government had taken similarly quick action five years later, the Argentines would not have invaded in 1982 leading to the Falklands War.\n\nThe 1977 rules of engagement were: \"Commanding officers and aircraft captains are to respond to any aggression with tactful firmness and are to exhibit a determination to meet any escalation, though not to exceed that already carried out by the enemy.\"\n\n\"All use of force must be governed by the principle of using only the minimum force necessary to achieve the aim.\" Such force must be used only until it was evident \"that the immediate aim is being achieved, and must in no way be retaliatory\".\n\nThe submarine commander was told: \"If you are attacked with [anti-submarine] weapons by [Argentine] forces, you are to surface or withdraw at high speed submerged, whichever will be of least risk to life.\"\n\nThey also set up a 50-mile security zone and any ships entering would be told that they must identify themselves and state their plans.

The views expressed in the statement, while not considered \"traditional conservative principles\" at the time, played a significant role in influencing Republican leaders in the 1980s. Written by M. Stanton Evans and adopted on September 11, 1960, the statement is named for the location of the inaugural meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, held at William F. Buckley, Jr.'s estate in Sharon, Connecticut.\n\nIn the late 1950s conservative students on college campuses campaigned for policies to combat communism. Many of these students became supporters of Barry Goldwater's 1960 campaign for the GOP vice-presidential nomination. At the Republican National Convention, Goldwater, failing to secure the nomination, challenged attendees saying: \"Let’s grow up conservatives. If you want to take the party back, then let’s get to work!\" In response, a meeting was organized at the home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut.\nIn attendance at the Sharon Conference were about 90 students from 44 universities located in 24 states. Amongst the attendees were several future conservative leaders including historian Lee Edwards, Howard Phillips, Don Lipsett (co-founder Philadelphia Society), Paul Niemeyer (United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit), \"National Review\" publisher William A. Rusher (\"National Review\" publisher), Allan Ryskind (publisher of \"Human Events\") and M. Stanton Evans. It was decided to organize a new organization which was named the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). Evans was selected to draft the founding principles of the group, named Sharon Statement after Buckley's residence. Evans said he was influenced by the works of conservative thinkers such as F. A. Hayek, Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley Jr., and Whittaker Chambers.\n\nThe Sharon Statement consists of 400 words. It's an expression of \"National Review\" editor Frank Meyer’s \"fusionism,\" described as a combination of traditional conservatism, libertarianism and anti-communism, the three prevailing variants of conservatism at the time. The inclusion of \"God\" in the document was controversial. The statement begins with the statement \"“foremost among the transcendent values is the individual’s use of his God-given free will.\" It then proceeds to espouse five core principles which have directed the conservative movement since its adoption:\n\n\nTwo years later, in 1962, Tom Hayden wrote the Port Huron Statement. The manifesto for Students for a Democratic Society has been called the left's response to the Sharon Statement.\n\nIn 2010, fifty years after the adoption of the Sharon Statement, the Mount Vernon Statement was written. The Mount Vernon Statement shares the same sentiment of the Sharon Statement. However where Sharon focuses on the \"outworkings of liberty and self-government\", Mount Vernon emphasizes a principle from the Declaration of Independence: that human freedom is based on \"the laws of nature and nature’s God.\"\n\nIn a 2010 interview, Evans reflected on the impact of the Sharon Statement attributing the document and the movement it spawned to the fall of the Soviet Union while failing to address the \"domestic spending issue\" and “cultural issues, educational issues.\"\n\nIn his obituary of Evans journalist Adam Clymer called it a \"seminal document\" in the establishment of the conservative movement.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation described the Sharon Statement as \"statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas of modern American conservatism\".\n\n\n"}

He was the brother of David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, and Lord Chancellor Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine. He was educated at the University of St Andrews (1760-1764), the University of Glasgow (1764-1766) and then to the University of Edinburgh in 1766. He was described as \"a tall and rather slender figure, a face sparkling with vivacity, a clear sweet voice, and general suffusion of elegance\".\n\nErskine is considered the lawyer who effectively created the modern adversarial. He was considered a legendary orator compared by his contemporaries to Cicero.\n\nErskine served as Lord Advocate from 1783 to 1784 in the Fox-North Coalition and again from 1806 to 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents. He was advocate and state councillor to the Prince of Wales in Scotland from 1783. He was Dean of the Faculty of Advocates from 1785 to 1795, but was not re-elected in 1796, due to his opposition to the war. Lord Cockburn, commenting on his replacement, observed that \"it was the Faculty of Advocates alone that suffered\". Robert Burns wrote a ballad memorializing the vote entitled, \"The Dean of Faculty\". In 1788, Erskine had the unenviable task of defending the celebrated Edinburgh thief Deacon Brodie. Despite his best efforts, Brodie was sentenced to death.\nErskine sat as Member of Parliament for Haddington Burghs from April to November 1806, and for Dumfries Burghs from 1806 to 1807.

In 1811 he gave up his practice at the bar and retired to his country residence of Almondell, in Linlithgowshire. It was said of him that \"no poor man wanted a friend while Harry Erskine lived.\" He published \"The Emigrant, an Eclogue\", 1773 and other poems.\n\nErskine married firstly Christian, daughter of George Fullerton, in 1772. They lived at Shoemakers Close on the Canongate. They had two sons and two daughters. Their eldest son, Henry, succeeded as 12th Earl of Buchan on his uncle's death in 1829. After Christian's death in May 1804 Erskine married as his second wife Erskine, daughter of Alexander Munro and widow of Sir James Turnbull, in 1805. This marriage was childless. Henry Erskine died in October 1817, aged 70. A bust of Erskine by Peter Turnerelli stands in Parliament Hall in Edinburgh.\n"}

The 2010 United States census reported Brookdale's population was 1,991.\n\nThe ZIP Code is 95007 and the community is inside area code 831. There is no mail delivery in Brookdale, though no home is more than 1.5 miles from the post office.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 3.8 square miles (10.0 km²), all of it land.\n\nThis region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Brookdale has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps.\n\nThe area was previously known as Clear Creek and then Brookville, and was the site of the Grover Lumber Mill by 1870. Logging and lumber was the major industry throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains at the time. James Harvey Logan, a Santa Cruz judge and creator of the loganberry, purchased the mill in 1900, created a creekside resort with cabins and camping, and established the Brookdale post office in 1902.\n\nBrookdale Lodge, a historic resort complex, is the main business in Brookdale. It was famous for decades, known especially for the stream running through its primary restaurant, the Brook Room (closed for renovation as of 2019). It currently has a reputation for being haunted by numerous ghosts. Started by Judge Logan, by 1922 it was owned by Dr. F. K. Camp, a Seventh-day Adventist physician, who envisioned a dining room spanning the creek and hired Horace Cotton of San Francisco to design it.\n\nIn its day, the Brookdale Lodge was the second most popular resort in California and hosted the rich and famous ... Hollywood stars, prominent families, foreign diplomats, and even President Herbert Hoover visited the scenic lodge. Famous persons passing through Brookdale Lodge included: Mae West, Marilyn Monroe, Tyrone Power, Joan Crawford, Rita Hayworth, Hedy Lamarr, and President Herbert Hoover. Shirley Temple and Johnny Weissmuller had homes nearby. Herbert Hoover visited often, and enjoyed fishing off the dining room bridge. And during the San Francisco conference establishing the United Nations, world leaders and diplomats came to the lodge to relax. The lodge was also famous for its first rate entertainment, attracting the best big band and swing groups of the era. There are at least three swing era songs written about the Brookdale including, My Brookdale Hideaway, A Place Known as Brookdale, and Beautiful Brookdale Lodge.\n\nThe lodge has changed hands many times since, and was condemned after a fire in 2009. Since 2016 it has been owned by Pravin and Naina Patel. The lodge appeared on the paranormal show Ghost Adventures in 2012. The property has once again been sold and is undergoing intensive renovations.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, a fire engulfed a two-story section of the lodge near the rear of the main building that contains apartments mostly occupied by lodge employees. There were no reports of injuries to anybody staying at the inn, though some firefighters suffered minor injuries while fighting the blaze.\n\nThere have been two other large fires at the Lodge, the first fire occurred on October 24, 1956. In that fire the dining room and an adjoining 12-room house were destroyed. A group of stores adjacent to the dining room were also badly damaged. Damage from the 1956 fire was estimated at $200,000. The second fire occurred in 2005 in the same area of the main hotel as the 2009 fire.\n\nThe origin of the fire is still under investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is helping to determine the cause of the three-alarm fire. According to the Boulder Creek Fire Chief the fire started under suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Brookdale had a population of 1,991.

He is one of the most celebrated cultural figures in Armenia, Iran and Austria.\n\nAs one of the leading conductors of his generation, he has led international orchestras throughout the world: in Austria, UK, United States’ Canada, Hungary, Copenhagen, Iran, Finland, USSR, Armenia, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Africa, Denmark, and Israel.\n\nAs a composer Tjeknavorian has written 6 operas, 5 symphonies, choral works (among them \"God is Love\", \"The Life of Christ\", the oratorio \"Book of Revelation\", and a requiem), chamber music, ballet music, piano and vocal works, concerti for piano, violin, guitar, cello and pipa (Chinese lute), as well as music for documentary and feature films.\n\nHis compositions have been performed by major orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Halle Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra Helsinki, American Symphony Orchestra in New York, Tehran Symphony Orchestra, Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra, Haifa Symphony Orchestra, the Mexico Symphony Orchestra, London Percussion Virtuosi, Strasbourg Percussion Ensemble and English Chamber Orchestra. He has made some 100 recordings with RCA, Philips, EMI, ASV, and others.\n\nBorn in Borujerd, Iran in 1937 to immigrant Armenian parents, Tjeknavorian's early life was succinctly chronicled in the London magazine \"Gramophone\" in 1976:\n\n\"His father came from Eastern Armenia and his mother had fled from Western Armenia during the 1915 Armenian Genocide…Influenced by three cultures, Armenian, Iranian and Western he benefited from a cosmopolitan upbringing. His grandfather, a doctor, liked to play the violin and as a boy Loris enjoyed listening to professional string-players (Russian, Armenian or Polish immigrants) in local cafés. Although not themselves musical, his parents wanted all three children (one boy, two girls) to play musical instruments. Eight-year-old Loris was given a violin. Despite the lack of a teacher, the boy began to study in earnest; before long he had composed a number of piano pieces, with no formal instruction whatsoever. At 16 he formed a four-part choir and organized and conducted his own orchestra in Teheran. A year later he was ready to leave for the Vienna Academy of Music as a violin and composition student. While there, he wrote a violin concerto, which received the ultimate endorsement from his teacher, Hans-Joachim Drevo, who was the soloist in the work's première. Tjeknavorian graduated with honours.\" (Gramophone, November 1976)\n\nShortly after his graduation, the Austrian music publisher Doblinger published four of his piano compositions as well as his \"Ballet Fantastique\" for three pianos, celeste and percussion in Vienna.\n\nFollowing this fruitful period of education, Tjeknavorian went back to Iran in 1961, where he taught music theory at the Tehran Conservatory of Music. At the same time, he was appointed director of Tehran's Music Archives and put in charge of collecting and researching traditional and modern Iranian folk music and instruments. He mounted the first Archives exhibition to great success, and began work on an opera based on the epic poem of \"Rostam and Sohrab\".\n\nTjeknavorian returned to Austria in 1963 to further his studies in Salzburg at the Mozarteum. There, he met the renowned composer Carl Orff, who was to become the young musician's mentor and enthusiastic supporter. On hearing Tjeknavorian play sections of his opera \"Rostam and Sohrab\", Orff offered him a full one-year scholarship to stay in Salzburg to complete the first draft of the opera. In addition, Orff commissioned Tjeknavorian to compose piano music based on Armenian music for the Schulwerk, Orff's system for teaching music. Tjeknavorian composed over 130 short pieces for beginning to advanced students. These are collected in two volumes called \"Kaleidoscope for Piano\", portions of which were also published by Schott as \"Bilder Aus Armenia\" (Pictures from Armenia).\n\nTjeknavorian moved to the United States in 1965, where he began to study conducting at the University of Michigan. From 1966 to 1967 he was appointed composer-in-residence at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, and from 1966 to 1970 head of the instrumental and opera departments at Moorhead University in Minnesota.\n\nIn 1970, the Cultural Ministry of Iran offered Tjeknavorian the positions of composer-in-residence and principal conductor at the Rudaki Opera House in Tehran. While there he conducted a number of major operas, including his own \"Pardis and Parisa\".\n\nTjeknavorian's extensive study of the technical aspects of traditional Iranian instruments culminated with the composition of the dance-drama \"Simorgh\", the first polyphonic composition scored entirely for Iranian instruments and based on themes from Zoroastrian myth and Persian mystical poetry. Following sold-out performances of the ballet in Tehran, the suite from \"Simorgh\" was recorded and released as an LP in London by Unicorn in 1975 to great critical acclaim. Writing about his unique compositional style, Gramophone praised the piece as \"strangely beautiful\".\n\nIn Tehran Tjeknavorian's talents found huge demand, and he soon became the leading composer of film music in Iran, scoring some 30 scores for documentaries and short and popular feature films, many of them classics of pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. Among them was the award-winning film \"Bita\", starring Iranian singing and acting legend Googoosh, released in 1972. That same year Tjeknavorian received the Homayoun Order and Medal for Persepolis, his score for the spectacular Son et Lumiere show at the ancient Persian capital. The audience consisted of dignitaries and heads of state from around the world that had gathered in Iran for the 2500th anniversary of the Persian Empire. The show was a highlight of the unprecedented event, and was followed by the release of the score by Philipps.\n\nIn 1975 Tjeknavorian relocated to London where he signed an exclusive conducting contract with the RCA recording company. His first release was the hugely acclaimed recording of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 (\"Pathetique\") with the LSO, hailed in Gramophone as \"bold and exciting\" and by RCA as \"an astounding performance of electrifying passion and nobility\".\n\nTjeknavorian's sudden impact on the international music scene in London created a furor, with RCA running two-page advertisement in Gramophone proclaiming him \"the greatest conductor of his generation\". Attended by talk-of-the-town performances at venues such as the Royal Festival Hall, Tjeknavorian followed this early success with a series of similarly acclaimed recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, including ground-breaking interpretations of Sibelius, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Dvorak, and Borodin. Tjeknavorian's also quickly established himself as the world's foremost interpreter of the symphonic music of Aram Khachaturian. His recording of the complete score of the ballet \"Gayaneh\", the first and only of its kind, was hailed by the London critics as \"first class\" and \"the most distinguished of the RCA recordings made by Loris Tjeknavorian\" (Gramophone, April 1977 and June 1983).\n\nIn 1978 Tjeknavorian organized Music Armenia, described in Gramophone as \"the first Armenian Festival on foreign soil. During the day there were symposiums, conferences and comparative studies of Armenian music, and in the evening, concerts presenting Armenian artists and composers.\" Speaking to the London magazine, Tjeknavorian explained: \"Being Christian, the first thing the Armenians did…was to translate the Bible as early as the fourth century AD. Then they started writing music in the fifth century. As soon as the alphabet was created, the chants started to be written down in old neumes. By the eighteenth century they could no longer decipher these neumes, so the musicians got together and renotated all the different chants. When I was studying in Vienna I discovered the Armenian Monastery there, and found a wealth of these chants. I became so involved in searching through all the manuscripts, it took me 15 years, and I found seven different traditions amounting to something like 30,000 melodies…It was far removed from my original idea of having the melodies just for my own compositional use, and I realized that it was of immense interest to musicologists\" (Gramophone, May 1979). For his long and dedicated work Tjeknavorian was awarded the Order of \"Gregory the Illuminator\" by the late Catholicos Vazgen I.\n\nTaking some of the medieval chants he had rediscovered, Tjeknavorian composed the vocal work \"Life of Christ\", first performed during the Festival at the Queen Elizabeth Hall by the Ambrosian Singers. Many of Tjeknavorian's most important compositions were written in this fruitful and personally difficult ten-year period culminating with, and immediately following, the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Foremost among his works during this time are his Second Symphony (Credo) and the oratorio \"The Book of Revelations\", the second and third parts respectively of his trilogy on the Armenian Genocide begun with his groundbreaking First Symphony (Requiem for the Massacred) scored for trumpet and percussion and released in London by Unicorn in 1976. Another key work towards the end of this period was his ballet \"Othello\", commissioned by the Northern Ballet Company and premiered in London in 1985 with Princess Ann in attendance. The recording of the piece released that year on EMI with the London Symphony Orchestra was praised by Gramophone as \"enormously effective\" (Gramophone, November 1985).\n\nSoon after settling in New York City in 1986, Tjeknavorian's destiny was diverted by the devastating Armenian earthquake of December 1988. In response, Tjeknavorian organized a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall to raise relief funds for the victims. The concert featured Plácido Domingo, Mstislav Rostropovich, Alexander Toradze and stars of the New York Metropolitan Opera, including Mirella Freni, Frederica von Stade, Samuel Ramey and Elena Obraztsova. Ticket sales for the event raised $500,000 that was sent to Armenia, where Tjeknavorian relocated a few months later, having been appointed Principal Conductor and Artistic Director of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra (APO) in Yerevan.\n\nFor Tjeknavorian, the most important task was rebuilding the cultural life of Gyumri (then Leninakan), Armenia's second largest city, which had been devastated by the earthquake. In 1991 Tjeknavorian announced his intention to go on a pilgrimage walk from Yerevan to Gyumri in order to raise funds for rebuilding efforts. Thousands of people joined him along the way and a huge percentage of the Armenian population donated money for the cause. Fifteen million rubles, worth around 20 million dollars at the time, were collected nationwide. Unfortunately, several months later the Soviet ruble was devalued and Tjeknavorian was compelled to seek additional money from private sources. Tjeknavorian took over the huge communist party headquarters, which had been destroyed, and in seven years transformed it into the first Academy of Music and Arts in Gyumri. During this time, his fundraising led to the founding of a symphony orchestra, wind ensemble, choir and dance ensemble, the renovation of the theater and restarting of the Gyumri TV station, and purchasing musical instruments for the orchestra and band, whose instruments had all been destroyed in the earthquake, as well as ten grand pianos for the Arts and Music Academy.\n\nTjeknavorian was also instrumental in the 1991 campaign for Armenian independence. Through his tours in various Armenian cities and an all-night televised performance on national television two days before the measure passed on September 21, 1991, Tjeknavorian managed to increase the \"Yes\" vote for independence from 30 to 96 per cent. Given the heated controversy and popular passions surrounding the question of independence, the peaceful nature of the victory was unique, reached by Tjeknavorian through the power of music and a positive cultural message.\n\nFollowing independence, Tjeknavorian served on the committee to reinstate the pre-communist Armenian flag and the national coat-of-arms. He was especially influential in the adoption of the national anthem, \"Mer Hayrenik\" (Our Fatherland), for which he rewrote the words for the first stanza. Tjeknavorian also renamed the two major avenues of Yerevan during last year of the Soviet period, from Lenin and Red Army to Mesrop Mashtots (creator of the Armenian alphabet in 451) and Gregory the Illuminator (founder of the Armenian church in 301 AD) respectively. The renaming reflected his philosophy of \"Faith and Culture\" as the twin foundations upon which the Armenian nation must be re-built. During the crippling energy blockade between 1992 and 1995 - a result of the Karabakh war - the capital was gripped by shortages of food, water, heat and electricity. Faithful to his vow that \"the doors of culture must never be closed\", Tjeknavorian maintained weekly concerts at this time, including a regular series of spiritual music concerts every Saturday in anticipation of the 1700th anniversary of Christianity in Armenia. Organizing transportation for the musicians and securing their daily needs, installing power generators and electric heaters and ensuring constant power supply in the building, Tjeknavorian turned the Aram Khachaturian Hall into a sanctuary of culture and faith, and was instrumental in lifting the spirits of the thousands who packed the hall each week. This phenomenon was memorialized by numerous eyewitnesses of the time, including former Russian Ambassador Vladimir Stupishin, who wrote at length about Tjeknavorian's activities in his memoirs.\n\nDuring his eleven-year collaboration with the APO, his recordings with the orchestra for ORF (the Austrian radio and television station) and ASV (an English recording company) achieved worldwide recognition; they frequently toured Europe, the United States, Canada, Iran and Lebanon. For three successive years, from 1991 to 1993, the APO was the resident orchestra in the ORF benefit program Licht Ins Dunkel in Vienna.\n\nIn 2000, Tjeknavorian resigned from the APO in order to devote more time to composing. During this period he also conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, and performed at the San Francisco Opera House, the Contemporary Music Festival and at the Vienna Music Festival in Hong Kong and Bangkok. He conducted the Austrian premiere of his opera \"Rostam and Sohrab\" at the Festspielhaus in St. Pölten.\n\nFrom 2009 to the present Tjeknavorian has continued to devote his time to composing, as well as painting and writing short stories. Among his most recent works are the operas \"Zahak\" (libretto based on Ferdowsi's Shahnameh) and \"Mowlana and Shams-e Tabriz\" (libretto based on the poetry of Rumi), as well as the chamber opera \"The Final Hour of Sadegh Hedayat\" (libretto based on \"The Blind Owl\" and other works by the Iranian writer Sadegh Hedayat). Other works include his second concerto for violin and chamber orchestra, a work for solo piano titled \"1915\", and two major symphonic suites: \"King Cyrus\", about the ancient Persian king, and \"Takhti\", dedicated to the celebrated Iranian wrestler. Tjeknavorian's paintings were exhibited at the Gallery Shirin in Tehran, Gallery Maryam Seyhoun in Los Angeles, and twice at the House of the Artists in Tehran. His series of short stories, written in English, will be published in the near future.\n\nOn December 20, 2008, Tjeknavorian recorded Hafez Nazeri's \"The night of Angel\" (yet to be released) with the London Symphony orchestra.\n\nTjeknavorian's recent performances include benefit concerts in Tehran and Los Angeles for the organization MAHAK on behalf of children with cancer, a series of concerts with the Armenian Chamber Orchestra at the Talar Vahdat Hall in Tehran, a performance of his \"Ararat Suite\" with the Sacramento Symphony, and the world premiere of his \"King Cyrus\" symphonic suite with the San Francisco Philharmonic Orchestra in August 2013. In 2011 the Iranian BARBAD recording company issued a 20-CD box set of Tjerknavorian's major works (symphonies, choral works, ballet, chamber music, operas, etc.) plus 2 DVDs of his opera Rostam & Sohrab.\n\nDuring an interview on the occasion of his 81st birthday, Tjeknavorian said to the journalist of IRNA: \"Iran is my homeland. My ancestors have lived in this land. I’ve been born in Iran and will be buried here. I’m emotionally and culturally attached to every inch of this country and feel at home in nowhere except for Iran.\"\n\nIn 1989, Tjeknavarian was appointed Principal Conductor and Artistic Director of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra (APO). During his eleven years collaboration with the APO, his recordings for ORF (the Austrian radio and television station) and ASV (an English recording company) achieved worldwide recognition, they frequently toured Europe, the United States, Canada, Iran and Lebanon. In three successive years, from 1991 to 1993, the APO was the resident orchestra in the ORF benefit program \"Licht ins Dunkel\" (\"Light into the Darkness\") in Vienna. However, in 2000, Tjeknavarian resigned from this position in order to be able to devote more time to composing and conducting other orchestras.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Greek Septuagint of Genesis 10 lists \"Elisa\" not only as the son of Javan, but also a grandson of Japheth.\n\nScholars have often identified Elishah with Cypriots, as in ancient times the island of Cyprus or part of it was known as Alashiya.\n\nJudean historian Flavius Josephus related the descendants of Elishah with the Aeolians, one of the ancestral branches of the Greeks.\n\nElishah is also mentioned in the mediaeval, rabbinic \"Book of Jasher\" (Hebrew transliteration: Sefer haYashar); he is said in \"Jasher\" to have been the ancestor of the \"Almanim\", possibly a reference to Germanic tribes (Alemanni). An older and more common tradition refers to him as a settler of Greece, particularly Elis in the Peloponnese. \nLusitanian mythology traditionally makes Elishah (under the name Lysias/Lísias) an ancestor and predecessor of Lusus (Elisha being older, having arrived accompanying his uncle Tubal founding Portalegre in 1900 BC under Iberian king Brigo). Lysias' own supposed tomb (in Portalegre) claims that he was the first \"cultivator\" of Lusitania. Lusus' reign is traditionally placed in the 16th - 15th centuries BC, e.g., in the \"Livro Primeiro da Monarchia Lusitana\". All this is debated; Lusus has also been described as coming before Lysias, who would thus be too late to be Elishah or vaguely at the same time, or even the same individual under different names. Lusus is sometimes called a son of Baccus and of the lineage of Lysias, or the other way around, or even a mere companion.\n\nThe Portuguese orator and mythographer Father António Vieira (1608-1697) refers to Elishah (under his actual biblical name) as founder and eponym of Lisbon and Lusitania (when he came to Iberia with his uncle Tubal), as well as the origin of the name of the mythological Elysium. Vieira also identified Elisha's biblical brother Tarshish as the founder of Tartesos in Andalucia, implying both would have come to Iberia with Tubal (though this isn't the only theory on the identity of Tarshish). Elishah in this Portuguese portrayal is identified with Bacchus' captain Lysias/Lísias, sometimes also with Lusus and Phoroneus, and is referred to as the founder of Portalegre and being buried at the \"Ermida de São Cristovão\" (Chapel of Saint Christopher) inside the town.\n\n"}

Native American tribes in the region visited Amoskeag Falls due to its plentiful migrating sturgeon, alewife, and salmon, which were easily fished in the rapids. Natives typically caught fish using a combination of large nets strung across the river. Significant native settlements were sited near the falls, particularly on the high bluffs overlooking the east side of the river.\n\nIn 1807, Samuel Blodgett started a canal and lock system at the river to help vessels navigate around the falls, opening the area to development. This soon led to the use of the falls for a power canal to provide water power for Manchester's 19th century industrial development, most notable for the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.\n\nDue to the significance of the falls in Manchester history, a number of local companies have adopted their name. Examples include the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company (which operated a majority of Manchester's textile mills using power from the falls until they closed in the midst of labor strikes in 1935), its division called the Amoskeag Locomotive Works (an early manufacturer of fire trucks and train cars), and the Amoskeag Fishways (an environmental education center located at the Amoskeag Falls).\n"}

He was educated at Enfield Grammar School, and later at the Edinburgh High School, where in 1777 he was the Latin dux. After studying law at the University of Edinburgh he was admitted as an advocate on 11 December 1784, and on 25 March 1786 was appointed a Deputy Advocate.\n\nIn 1788 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, James Gregory, and the mathematician John Playfair.\n\nThough not conspicuous as a lawyer he was an accomplished public speaker, and in this capacity made himself useful at the Tory political meetings. On 5 June 1792 he became Sheriff of Orkney, and in June 1801 was appointed Lord Advocate in the Addington administration in the room of Robert Dundas of Arniston. Shortly afterwards he was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh, together with a piece of plate, for his assistance to the magistrates in obtaining a poor's bill for the city.\n\nAt the general election in July 1802, he was returned to the House of Commons for Dumfries district, but resigned his seat when Henry Dundas's elevation to the upper house, and was returned unopposed for the city of Edinburgh (January 1803). During his service as Lord Advocate, Hope conducted through the House of Commons the Scotch Parochial Schoolmasters' Act (43 Geo. III, c. 54), by means of which authorities building schools were also obliged to erect houses with at least two rooms for the schoolmasters.\n\nThe only speech of his reported in the 'Parliamentary Debates' was one delivered in his own defence in the debate on Whitbread's motion for the production of papers relating to Hope's censure of a Banffshire farmer named Morison, who had discharged his servant for attending drills of a volunteer regiment. Hope made an ingenious defence, and gave a lively description of the multitudinous duties of his office but though the case against him was strong, the motion, after a great party debate in which both Pitt and Fox took part, was defeated by 159 to 82.\n\nOn 20 November 1804, Hope was appointed an ordinary Lord of Session and Lord Justice Clerk in the place of Sir David Rae, Lord Eskgrove, and assuming the title of Lord Granton took his seat on the bench on 6 December 1804. On 12 November 1811, he succeeded Robert Blair, Lord Avontoun as Lord President of the Court of Session, being succeeded as Lord Justice Clerk by David Boyle, Lord Boyle. In 1820, he presided at the special commission for the trial of high treason at Glasgow, and on 17 August 1822 was admitted to the Privy Council at Holyrood House. On 29 July 1823, Hope was appointed, together with his eldest son John, on the Commission of Inquiry into the forms of process and the course of appeals in Scotland. On the death of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, in December 1836, Hope became Lord Justice General, by virtue of the Court of Session Act 1830 , by which it was enacted that 'after the termination of the present existing interest' that office should 'devolve upon and remain united with the office of lord president of the court of session.' Hope retired from the bench in the autumn of 1841, and was succeeded as Lord President by David Boyle.\n\nHe died at his home on 12 Moray Place, Edinburgh on 30 October 1851, aged 89. He was buried in the mausoleum at Hopetoun House on 4 November 1851.\n\nHope was a man of imposing presence, with a magnificent voice, which, according to Lord Cockburn, 'was surpassed by that of the great Mrs. Siddons alone', and a wonderful gift of declamation.\n\nThough a violent political partisan, and greatly wanting in tact and judgment, 'his integrity, candour, kindness, and gentlemanlike manners and feelings gained him almost unanimous esteem'. His charges to juries were singularly persuasive and impressive. Lockhart gives a graphic account of Hope's majestic bearing on the bench in 'Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk' (1819, ii. 102–8), while recording what he describes 'as without exception the finest piece of judicial eloquence, delivered in the finest possible way by the Lord-president Hope.'\n\nWhen the volunteer movement began, owing to the French war, Hope enlisted as a private in the first regiment of Royal Edinburgh Volunteers.\n\nHe was afterwards appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the Corps, and performed the duties of that office with enthusiasm for several years, until the regiment was disbanded for the second time in 1814.\n\nIn December 1819, when the 'old blues' were once more summoned together, he made them 'one of the most eloquent addresses that ever was heard', and daily inspected the volunteers on duty at Edinburgh Castle while the regular troops were despatched to the western counties.\n\nHope's famous regimental orders of 18 October 1803, containing most curious and minute details, are given at length in Cockburn's 'Memorials'.\n\nOn 8 August 1793 Hope married his cousin Lady Charlotte Hope, second daughter of John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun, by his third wife, Lady Elizabeth Leslie, second daughter of Alexander, fifth earl of Leven and Melville, by whom he had four sons- of whom the eldest, John (1794–1858), was Solicitor General for Scotland from 1822 to 1830- and eight daughters. His youngest daughter Ann Wilhelmina was married to Hercules Robertson, Lord Benholme.\n\nHis wife died at Edinburgh on 22 January 1834, aged 62.\n\nDavid Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead, Lord President of the Court of Session from 1989 to 1996, descends from Lord Granton's third son.\n"}

{"id": "1973092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973092", "title": "Taxation in the Republic of Ireland", "text": "Taxation in the Republic of Ireland\n\nTaxation in the Republic of Ireland in 2017 came from Personal Income taxes (40% of Exchequer Tax Revenues, or ETR), and Consumption taxes, being VAT (27% of ETR) and Excise and Customs duties (12% of ETR). Corporation taxes (16% of ETR) represents most of the balance (to 95% of ETR), but Ireland's Corporate Tax System (CT) is a central part of Ireland's economic model. Ireland summarises its taxation policy using the OECD's \"Hierarchy of Taxes\" pyramid (see graphic), which emphasises high corporate tax rates as the most harmful types of taxes where economic growth is the objective. The balance of Ireland's taxes are Property taxes (<3% of ETR, being Stamp duty and LPT) and Capital taxes (<3% of ETR, being CGT and CAT).\n\nAn issue in comparing the Irish tax system to other economies is adjusting for the artificial inflation of Irish GDP by the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools of U.S. multinationals in Ireland. In 2017, the Central Bank of Ireland replaced Irish GDP with Irish GNI* to remove the distortion; 2017 GDP was 162% of 2017 GNI* (EU–28 2017 GDP was 100% of GNI). Properly adjusted, Ireland's Total \"Gross Tax-to-GNI*\" ratio of 36% is in-line with the EU–28 average (36%), and above the OECD average (33%); Ireland's \"Exchequer Tax-to-GNI*\" ratio of 28%, is in line with the EU–28 average (28%), and the OECD average (27%). Within these aggregate taxation metrics, the most distinctive differences between Ireland's taxation system and those of the average EU–28 and OECD taxation systems, are lower net Irish \"Social Security Contributions\" (i.e. PRSI less child benefits), offset by higher Irish Corporation tax receipts.\n\nWithin Ireland's taxation system, the most distinctive element is the ratio of net Personal Income taxes on higher earners versus lower earners, which is called \"progressivity\". In 2016, the OECD ranked Irish personal taxation as the 2nd most \"progressive tax\" system in the OECD, with the top 10% of earners paying 60% of taxes. The 2018 OCED \"Taxing Wages\" study showed Irish average single and average married wage-earners paid some of the lowest \"effective\" employment tax rates in the OECD, with Irish average married wage-earners paying an employee tax rate of 1.2%.\n\nIn 2018, the Irish Revenue disclosed that 80% of 2017 Irish corporate tax was paid by foreign multinationals, and the top 10 multinationals paid 40% of Irish Corporation tax in 2017. Ireland's Corporate tax system is controversial and has drawn labels of \"Ireland as a tax haven\". In June 2017, Ireland's CT system was ranked as one of the world's largest Conduit OFCs (i.e. places that act as links to tax havens), in March 2018 the Financial Stability Forum ranked Ireland as the 3rd largest Shadow Banking OFC, and in June 2018 tax academics calculated that Ireland was the world's largest corporate tax haven.\n\nIreland's Property taxes (Stamp duty and LPT) are in line with the EU and OECD averages, but unlike Irish Income taxes, are not overtly progressive.\n\nEach year, the Department of Finance is required to produce a report on \"Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure\" for the coming year. The table below, is extracted from the \"Tax Revenues\" section of the report for the prior-year (e.g. the 2017 column is from the 2018 report), by which time the \"Tax Revenues\" for that year are largely known (although still subject to further revision in later years).\n\nThe \"Tax Revenues\" quoted are \"Exchequer Tax Revenues\", and do not include \"Appropriations-in-Aid\" (\"A–in–A\") items, the largest being Social Security (or PRSI) which for 2015 was €10.2 billion, and other smaller items. Irish Personal Income tax, and the two main Irish consumption taxes of VAT and Excise, have consistently been circa 80% of the total Irish Exchequer Tax Revenue, with the balance being Corporate tax.\n\nComparisons of Ireland's tax system and international tax systems are complicated by two issues:\n\n\nKey sources for comparison are the OECD \"Tax Database\" and the OECD \"Ireland Tax Bulletins\". The Department of Finance has a \"Tax Policy Group\" which up until 2014, published documents that compared Ireland's taxation system internationally, including the main tax policy differences with other OECD countries.\n\nFrom 2000–2014, Ireland's Total \"Gross Tax-to-GDP\" ratio was 27–30%, versus the OECD average of 33%, and EU–27 average of 36%. In October 2013, the Department of Finance \"Tax Policy Group\", highlighted the distortion of Irish GDP impacted this metric, and Ireland's \"Tax-to-GNP\" ratio at 36% was above the OECD average, and in line with the EU–27 average.\n\nHowever, since Apple's 2015 leprechaun economics restructuring, Ireland's headline \"Tax-to-GDP\" ratio had fallen to the bottom of the OECD range at under 23%. Using 2017 GNI* (Irish 2017 GDP is 162% of Irish 2017 GNI*), Ireland \"Tax-to-GNI*\" ratio is back to 33%, in line with the OECD average. In 2017, Eurostat noted that Irish GNI* still contained BEPS tool distortions, and thus the Irish \"Tax-to-GNI*\" ratio is \"understated\".\n\nThe OECD's 2018 \"Taxing Wages\" shows Ireland's tax wedge for labour income, which is the total tax (PAYE and EE and ER–PRSI less SS Benefits) paid on Irish wages by both the employee and employer, as a % of the total cost of labour to the employer (PAYE and ER–PRSI), is one of the lowest in the OECD. Of the 35 OCED members in 2017, the average Irish single-worker cost 27.2% in taxes versus the OECD average of 35.9% (ranked 29th–lowest), and the average Irish married worker cost 10.8% in taxes versus the OECD average of 26.1% (ranked 31st–lowest).\n\nThe OECD's 2018 \"Taxing Wages\" shows Ireland's employee tax on wages, which is the total tax (PAYE and EE–PRSI less SS Benefits) paid by Irish employees, as a % of their gross wages, is also one of the lowest in the OECD. Of the 35 OCED members in 2017, the average Irish single-worker paid 19.4% versus the OECD average of 25.5% (ranked 28th–lowest), and the average Irish married worker paid 1.2% versus the OECD average of 14.0% (ranked 33rd–lowest).\n\nIn relation to the single-worker, the OECD noted that a driver of the lower Irish rate is that EE–PRSI (or employee social security contributions) are lower in Ireland versus the OECD average. PAYE and ER–PRSI accounted for 87% of the Irish tax wedge for labour income, whereas for the OECD average it was 77%. In relation to the married-worker, the OECD noted the additional effect of Irish child benefit and provisions which reduced the married-worker employee tax by 16.4%, whereas for the OECD average it was 9.8%. Ireland's lower EE–PRSI, and higher child benefits, have been noted in other studies.\n\nAside from lower employee social security levies (e.g. EE–PRSI), the most distinctive aspect of Ireland's personal tax system is the level of \"Progressivity\", as defined by the ratio of the employee tax (or tax wedge for income) at 167% of the average wage, to employee tax at 67% of the average wage. In October 2013, the Department of Finance \"Tax Policy Group\", highlighted that Ireland has the most progressive personal tax system in the OECD. By September 2016, the \"Irish Tax Institute\" showed that Ireland was the 2nd most progressive personal tax system in the OECD.\n\nThe progressive nature of Ireland's personal tax system is also apparent in the distribution of Irish personal tax. In October 2013, the Department of Finance \"Tax Policy Group\", highlighted the following personal tax (PAYE and EE–PRSI), statistics from the Irish Revenue Commissioners for the 2012 tax year:\n\nThe above format of the \"Tax Policy Group\" has never been reproduced, in April 2018, the OECD and the Irish Revenue Commissioners disclosed that in 2015:\n\nIrish \"headline\" VAT is in line with EU VAT rates (see graphic). The OCED \"Revenue Statistics 2017 – Ireland\", ranks Ireland as being below the OECD average for \"effective\" VAT (22nd–lowest out of 35 OECD countries), but in line with the OECD average for overall Consumption taxes (e.g. VAT and Excise combined), ranking 16th of out 35 OECD countries. In October 2013, the Department of Finance \"Tax Policy Group\", highlighted that the distortion of Irish GDP impacted this metric and that Ireland's \"Consumption Tax as % of GNP\" ratio at 12%, and \"VAT as % of GNP\" ration at 8%, was at the EU–27 average for both metrics.\n\nIreland's taxation system is distinctive for its low \"headline\" rate of corporation tax at 12.5% (for trading income), which is half the OECD average of 24.9%. While Ireland's corporate tax is only 16% of Total Net Revenues (see above), Ireland's corporate tax system is a central part of Ireland's economic model. Not only do foreign multinationals pay 80% of Ireland's corporation tax, but they also directly employ 10% of the Irish labour force, rising to 23% when Public Sector, agri and finance jobs are excluded and pay 50% of all Irish salary taxes using the same metric; in 2016, they were 57% of all Irish non-farm OECD value-add (see \"multinational economy\"). A source of controversy is the \"effective\" tax rate of Ireland corporation tax system, of which the independent evidence is that it is less than 4%, and as low as 0.005% for major U.S. multinationals (see \"Irish effective corporate tax rate\").\n\nIreland's Corporate Tax System has seen Ireland \"labelled a tax haven\", and in June 2018, academics estimated that Ireland was the largest \"global tax haven\". Ireland's reputation as a tax haven for foreign multinationals to avoid global taxes contrasts with that fact that Ireland's overall tax receipts are in line with the EU and OECD averages (when properly adjusted using Irish GNI*, and not the distorted Irish GDP).\n\nIncome tax is charged in respect of all property, profits, or gains. Since 2002, Ireland has operated a tax year coinciding with the calendar year (1 January to 31 December). The change coincided with the introduction of the euro in Ireland. For administrative purposes, taxable income is expressed under four schedules:\n\nSince 1 January 2015, the tax rates apply as follows:\n\nThere are 2 tax brackets, 20% (the \"standard rate\") and the balance of income at 40% (the \"higher rate\"). The brackets depend upon the individual's category.\n\nThe €43,550 amount may, for married couples, be increased by the lesser of: €25,550 or the income of the second spouse. This brings the total maximum standard rate band for a married couple to €69,100, twice the single person's band. The increase is not transferable between spouses.\n\nIrish income tax brackets (2019)\n\nThe €44,300 amount may, for married couples, be increased by the lesser of: €26,300 or the income of the second spouse. This brings the total maximum standard rate band for a married couple to €70,600, little less than twice the single person's band. The increase is not transferable between spouses.\n\nA taxpayer's tax liability is reduced by the amount of his tax credits, which replaced tax-free allowances in 2001. Tax credits are not refundable in the event that they exceed the amount of tax due, but may be carried forward within a year.\n\nA wide range of tax credits are available. A few are awarded automatically, while others must be claimed by taxpayers.\n\nThe principal tax credit is the personal tax credit, which is currently €1,650 per year for a single person and €3,300 per year for a married couple. A widowed person in the year of bereavement, or for as long as she has dependent children, may claim the €3,300 credit as well; a higher credit is available to widowed parents during the five tax years following the bereavement.\n\nThe PAYE tax credit, which is also €1,650, is awarded to employees and others who pay tax under the Pay as you earn system (further details below), to compensate them for the time value of money effect; their tax is deducted from their incomes during the year, whereas the self-employed pay near the end of the year. The credit may not exceed 20% of the recipient's income during the year and it is not transferable between spouses.\n\nA person resident and domiciled in Ireland is liable to Irish income tax on their total income from all sources worldwide. In this sense, a person who spends:\nis considered to be resident. Presence in Ireland of not more than 30 days in a tax year is ignored for the purposes of the two year test. Since 1 January 2009, a person is treated as present in Ireland for a day if present at any time during the day; before this, a person was only treated as present if he or she was present at midnight, a rule which was nicknamed the \"Cinderella clause\". A person may also elect to be resident in Ireland in a year in which he arrives in Ireland, once he can satisfy Revenue that he intends to remain there for the next tax year.\n\nA person who is resident in Ireland for three consecutive years becomes ordinarily resident, and ceases to be ordinarily resident after he has been non-resident in Ireland for three consecutive years.\n\nA person is domiciled in Ireland if born in Ireland; a person who has \"demonstrated a positive intention of permanent residence in [a] new country\" ceases to be domiciled in Ireland.\n\nA person who is not an Irish resident but is ordinarily resident in Ireland is liable to tax on all Irish and foreign-sourced income in full, except for income from a trade, profession, office, or employment, the duties of which are entirely exercised outside Ireland, and on foreign income under €3,810 per year.\n\nA person who is resident in Ireland, and is either ordinarily resident or domiciled in Ireland, but not both, is liable to tax on all Irish income in full, and on such foreign income as is remitted to Ireland.\n\nA person who is neither resident, ordinarily resident, nor domiciled in Ireland is taxable on all Irish sourced income in full, and on foreign sourced income in respect of a trade, profession, or employment exercised in Ireland.\n\nA person aged 65 or over during the tax year is exempt from income tax if his or her income is under €18,000 per year. A married couple with income under €36,000 per year is also exempt if either spouse is aged 65 or over or reaches 65 during the year; the exemption amount is increased by €575 for each of the couple's first two dependent children and by €830 for each subsequent child.\n\nA person or couple earning slightly over the limit may claim what is known as marginal relief. In this case, income over the exemption limit is charged to tax at a flat rate of 40%. A person or couple may choose to be taxed under marginal relief or the regular tax system, and will be granted whichever system is more beneficial, including retroactively.\n\nSome items of expenditure can be deducted from a person's income for tax purposes, generally referred to as getting tax relief. In some cases the tax must be claimed retrospectively; in others it is processed as an increase to tax credits. The vast majority are only allowed at the standard tax rate of 20%.\n\nA person purchasing private medical insurance is entitled to tax relief at 20%, which is usually given at source – the person pays 80% of the cost, and the government pays the rest directly to the insurance company. Persons aged over 50 are entitled to a further tax credit, which is normally paid in full to the insurance company to offset the considerably higher cost incurred by insurers in respect of members over 50.\n\nTax relief is available on medical expenses. With the exception of fees paid to approved nursing homes, the relief is only available retrospectively (i.e. by completing a tax return at the end of the year), and the relief is awarded at 20% since 2009. It can be claimed for a person's own expenses, or expenses which they pay on behalf of a relative, dependant, or, since 2007, anyone at all.\n\nMedical expenses are construed widely, and include:\n\nThe relief can be claimed in the year when the cost was incurred or in the year when the payment was made.\n\nA person may deduct from his income for the purposes of tax calculation up to 10% of that income which is spent on permanent health insurance. Relief is therefore given at 40% if the person is paying the higher rate of tax. If the\npayment is made by salary deduction the payment is treated as a benefit in kind (BIK) and as such is subject to the Universal Social Charge (USC) and PRSI.\n\nTax relief is allowed on service charges paid to a local council for domestic sewage disposal, as well as all payments for domestic water supply or domestic refuse collection or disposal. The relief is allowed in arrears – credit for payments made in 2007 is given in 2008 – and is given at 20%, to a maximum of €80 (where €400 or more was paid for service charges). It will cease from 2011.\n\nTax relief at 20% is allowed in respect of tuition fees paid for third-level courses, excluding the first €2,500 for a full-time course and €1,250 for a part-time course, of the course fees). The maximum relief available is €1,400 per year (20% of €7,000). Courses must be of at least two years duration, except for postgraduate courses which must be of at least one-year duration. The course must also be approved by Revenue and delivered in a college approved by Revenue.\n\nAs with medical expenses, since 2007 the relief could be claimed in respect of payments made by any person, irrespective of the relationship between payer and payee. It cannot be claimed in respect of administration, registration, or examination fees.\n\nRelief is also allowed in respect of fees of over €315 for foreign-language or information technology courses approved by FÁS, of less than two years duration, which results in the award of a certificate of competence. The relief is for 20% of the amount paid, to a maximum of €254 (20% of €1,270) per course. It is not available for courses in the Irish or English languages.\n\nContributions to a pension scheme can be deducted from gross income before calculation of tax; tax relief is therefore allowed on them at 40% if the contributor is paying tax at that rate. Contributions (including AVCs) are subject to the Universal Service Charge currently at 7%.\n\nTaxpayers pay either on a \"pay as you earn\" system or a \"pay and file\" system.\n\nEmployees, pensioners, and directors generally have tax deducted from their income by their employers as it is paid. Under this system, tax is calculated by the employer on each pay day, withheld, and paid over to Revenue. Employers receive notification of the tax credit and standard rate band applicable to the employee from Revenue. A PAYE employee need only file a tax return on form 12 if requested to do so by an inspector of taxes, if she has other undeclared income, or if she wishes to claim reliefs which are not available on another form.\n\nThe self-assessment system applies to persons who are self-employed or who receive non-PAYE income. Under the self-assessment system, a taxpayer must:\nby the deadline each year. The deadline is 31 October for paper filings. It has historically been extended to mid-November for returns filed online, but it is not clear whether this will continue.\n\nPreliminary tax must be at least equal to the least of:\n\nRevenue will calculate the tax payable for a person who files a return of income more than two months prior to the filing deadline.\n\nUnderpaid tax attracts an interest penalty charge of 0.0219% per day, and underpayments may result in a surcharge, prosecution, or publication of their name in a defaulters' list.\n\nThe Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax on income that replaced both the income levy and the health levy (also known as the health contribution) since 1 January 2011. It is charged on your \"gross income\" before any pension contributions or PRSI.\n\nIf your income is less than €13,000 you pay no Universal Social Charge (USC). (This limit was €4,004 in 2011, €10,036 from 2012 to 2014 and €12,012 in 2015.) Once your income is over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on \"all\" of your income. For example, if you have income of €13,000 you will pay no USC. If you have income of €13,001 you will pay 0.5% on income up to €12,012 and 2.5% on income between €12,012 and €13,001.\n\nAggregate income for USC purposes does not include payments from the Department of Social Protection.\n\nReduced rates of USC apply to:\n\nPRSI is paid by employees, employers, and the self-employed as a percentage of wages after pension contributions. It includes social insurance and a health contribution. Social insurance payments are used to help pay for social welfare payments and pensions. Each week's payment earns the employee a \"credit\" or \"contribution\", which credits are used to establish entitlements to non-means-tested welfare payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit and the State Pension (contributory). The health contribution is used to help fund the health services, although paying it does not confer any entitlement to treatment or anything else. For the most part, the two amounts are combined together and stated as one deduction on payslips. There was a ceiling of €75,036 per year on the employee social insurance element of the payment but this ceiling was abolished from 2011 onwards.\n\nClass A workers are employees aged under 66 in industrial, commercial, and service-type employment who are paid more than €38 a week from all employments, as well as to public servants recruited from 6 April 1995. Class A employees earning under €352 per week are placed in subclass AO, and pay no PRSI/ Class A employees earning between €352 and €356 are in subclass AX; those earning over €356 but less than or equal to €500 are in subclass AL. Both subclasses pay 4% PRSI, and the first €127 of earnings are no longer disregarded for this calculation, so therefore PRSI is 4% on all earnings/ Class A employees earning over €500 per week are in subclass A1 and pay 4% on all their weekly earnings.\n\nEmployers of employees in the above classes pay 8.5% PRSI for employees earning under €356 per week and 10.75% PRSI for employees earning over that amount. The applicable rate applies on the entire wage, with no ceiling. Classes A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and A9 relate to community employment schemes and employer's PRSI exemption schemes. Class A8 is for income under €352 per week and has no employee PRSI liability; class A9 is for income over that amount and is liable at a flat rate of 4%. Both classes have an employer's PRSI rate of 0.5%.\n\nClass B workers are permanent and pensionable civil servants recruited before 6 April 1995, doctors and dentists employed in the civil service, and gardaí recruited before 6 April 1995. Class B workers earning under €352 per week are placed in subclass BO, and pay no PRSI. Class B workers earning between €352 and €500 per week are placed in subclass BX, and class B workers earning over €500 per week but exempt from the health contribution are placed in subclass B2. Both these subclasses pay 0.9% PRSI on all earnings except the first €26 per week. Class B workers earning over €500 per week and not exempt from the health contribution are placed in subclass B1. They pay 4% PRSI on the first €26 of their weekly earnings, 4.9% on the next €1,417, and 5.9% on the balance.\n\nClass C workers are commissioned officers of the defence forces, and members of the army nursing service, recruited before 6 April 1995. Class D workers are all permanent and pensionable employees in the public service not caught in classes B or C, recruited before 6 April 1995. Workers in classes C and D pay PRSI at the same rates as class B.\n\nEmployers of class B employees pay a flat rate of 2.01% PRSI on all their employees' earnings; for class C, the rate is 1.85%, and for class D it is 2.35%, although this is effectively a transfer of money from one government account to another.\n\nClass H workers are non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel of the Defence Forces. Class H workers earning under €352 per week are placed in subclass HO, and pay no PRSI. Class H workers earning from €352 to €500 per week are placed in subclass HX. Class H workers earning over €500 and exempt from the health contribution are placed in subclass H2. Workers in each of these classes pay 3.9% PRSI on their earnings except for the first €127 per week. Other class H workers are placed in subclass H1. They pay 4% PRSI on the first €127 of their weekly earnings, 7.9% on the next €1,316, and 8.9% on the balance. Employers of class H workers pay 10.05% PRSI on all their employees' earnings.\n\nClass J workers are employees aged 66 or over, those earning under €38 per week, or those in subsidiary employment. They pay only the health contribution of 4% if their earnings exceed €500 per week, or 5% on the amount that exceeds €1,443 per week. The employer's contribution is 0.5%. Subsidiary employment includes the employment of a person subject to class B, C, D, or H in his main employment.\n\nClasses K and M apply to income which is subject to the health contribution but not to social insurance, including occupational pensions. It also applies to judges, state solicitors, and income of self-employed persons aged 66 or over.\n\nClass K income is subject to the health contribution of 4% if earnings exceed €500 per week, or 5% on the amount that exceeds €1,443 per week. There is no employer contribution.\n\nClass M relates to persons under 16, who are exempt from PRSI entirely, and to income which would fall under class K paid to persons exempt from the health contribution. It has a zero rate.\n\nSelf-employed people, including certain company directors, pay class S PRSI; the class also applies to certain investment and rental income.\n\nWhere income is less than €500 per week, subclass S0 applies. Where income is above €500 per week, subclass S1 applies, except to persons exempt from the health contribution, to whom subclass S2 applies. The rate for subclasses S0 and S2 is 3%, and the rate for subclass S1 is 7% up to €1,443 per week and 8% on that portion of income above that amount.\n\nThe health contribution was replaced by the USC from 2011 onwards\n\nTaxpayers paying class S PRSI pay it, and the health contribution, along with their tax. For other taxpayers, it is withheld from their net income.\n\nValue-Added Tax (VAT) is a transaction tax on Irish consumer spending, and almost all goods and services supplied in Ireland are subject to VAT. Goods imported into Ireland from outside the EU are also subject to VAT, which is charged by Customs at the border. Irish VAT is part of the European Union Value Added Tax system and each Member State is required to impose the EU VAT legislation by way of its own domestic legislation, however, there are key differences between the rules for each state. All non-exempt traders are required to register for VAT and collect VAT on the goods and services they supply. Each trader in the \"chain of supply\", from manufacturer to retailer, charges VAT on their sales and incurs VAT on their raw materials; they pay the Irish Revenue their net VAT.\n\nA trader whose turnover exceeds the registration thresholds, or is likely to exceed them in the next 12 months, must register for VAT.\n\nThe registration thresholds are as follows:\n\nA person below these limits may register voluntarily. It is often beneficial for persons who mainly trade with other businesses to register for VAT even when their turnover is below the relevant limits.\n\nVAT rates range from 0% on books, children's clothing and educational services and items, to 23% on the majority of goods. The 13.5% rate applies to many labour-intensive services as well as to restaurant meals, hot takeaway food, and bakery products. A 4.8% rate applies to supply of livestock and greyhounds. A 5.4% \"flat rate addition\" applies to the agricultural sector, although this is not strictly VAT – it is charged by farmers not registered for VAT to compensate them for VAT which they must pay to their suppliers. The flat rate addition is not paid away to the Revenue.\n\nTraders collecting VAT can deduct the VAT incurred on their purchases from their VAT liability, and where the VAT paid exceeds VAT received, can claim a refund. The VAT period is normally two calendar months (other filing periodicity, such as four-monthly, and semi-annual also apply in certain circumstances).\n\nA VAT return is made on the 19th day of the following the end of the period. However, if you submit the return on the website, i.e. ROS (\"Revenue Online Service\"), and also perform payment via ROS, then the due date is extended to the 23rd day following the end of the period.\n\nOnce a year a detailed breakdown of VAT returns must be prepared by traders and submitted to the government – traders may choose their own date for this. Traders with low VAT liabilities may opt for six-monthly or four-monthly payments instead of the standard bi-monthly one, and traders who are generally in the position of claiming repayments of VAT rather than making payments may make monthly returns.\n\nExcise tax is charged on mineral oil, tobacco, and alcohol.\n\nIrish corporation tax returns have historically been between 10% to 16% of total Irish net Tax Revenues, however, since 2015, corporation tax has risen sharply, doubling in scale from 4.6 billion in 2014 to 8.2 billion in 2017; the Revenue Commissioners state that foreign multinationals pay circa 80% of Irish corporation tax.\n\n, there are two rates of corporation tax (\"CT\") in the Republic of Ireland:\n\n\nThe special 10% tax rate for manufacturing in Ireland (introduced from 1980/81), and for financial services in the special economic zone of the International Financial Services Centre in Dubin (introduced from 1987), have now been phased out since 2010 and 2003 respectively, and are no longer in operation.\n\n, Ireland's corporate tax system is a \"worldwide tax\" system, with no thin capitalisation rules, and a holding company regime for tax inversions to Ireland. Ireland has the most U.S. corporate tax inversions, and \"Medtronic\" (2015) was the largest U.S. tax inversion in history.\n\nIreland's corporate tax system has base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools, such as the \"Double Irish\" (used by Google and Facebook), the \"Single Malt\" (used by Microsoft and Allergan), and the \"Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets\" (CAIA) (used by Accenture, and by Apple post Q1 2015); in June 2018, academics showed they are the largest global BEPS tools. Apple's 2015 restructure of its BEPS tools inflated Irish GDP by 34.4%, leprechaun economics.\n\nIreland's tax system also offers SPVs that can be used by foreign investors to avoid the 25% corporate tax on passive income from Irish assets, which are covered in more detail in \"Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)\", and in \"Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)\". The Irish QIAIF is a Central Bank of Ireland regulatory classification that includes the \"Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle\" or ICAV, and the \"L-QIAIF\".\n\nCapital gains tax is payable where a person makes a gain on the sale of assets, called \"chargeable assets\". The standard CGT rate is 33% in respect of disposals made from midnight on 7 December 2013. The rate of tax for disposals made in previous years is less: details can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners.\n\nAny person (including a company) resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland is liable to CGT on all chargeable gains accruing on all disposals of chargeable assets. A person resident or ordinarily resident, but not domiciled, in Ireland is only liable to CGT on disposals of assets outside of Ireland where the gains are remitted to Ireland.\n\nA person neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland is only liable to CGT on gains from:\n\nThe gain or loss is calculated as the sale price less the purchase price. From the sale price can be deducted the cost of acquisition of the asset, including incidental costs such as conveyancing costs, the cost of the disposal, and costs of improving the asset.\n\nWhere the asset was acquired prior to 6 April 1974, its value on that date is used instead of the purchase price.\n\nThe purchase price, cost of acquisition, and costs of improvement can be adjusted for inflation from 6 April 1974 up to 31 December 2002, and a table is published by Revenue for the purpose of calculating this adjustment. The inflation adjustment can only operate to reduce a gain; it cannot increase a loss or turn a gain into a loss.\n\nCapital losses can be offset against capital gains arising in the same or later tax year. Non-chargeable losses (see below) cannot be offset against chargeable gains. In each tax year losses carried forward must be used before exemptions are applied.\n\n\nTransfers between spouses do not give rise to a charge for capital gains tax; the acquiring spouse is considered to have acquired the property on the same date and at the same price as the disposing spouse.\n\nCGT is a self-assessment tax for all taxpayers. Tax on gains realised in the first eleven months of the year is payable by 15 December that year, and tax on gains realised in December payable by 31 January the next year. A return must be made by 31 October in the following year with full details of the gain.\n\nA person purchasing a chargeable asset for over €500,000 must withhold 15% of the price and pay it to Revenue unless the Revenue has issued a CG50A certificate to the vendor prior to the purchase. The certificate CG50A is issued by the Revenue on application, provided that either the vendor is resident in Ireland, no CGT is payable on the disposal, or the CGT has already been paid.\n\nDeposit Interest Retention Tax (abbreviated as DIRT), is a retention tax charged on interest earned on bank accounts, as well as some other investments. It was first introduced in Ireland in the 1980s to reduce tax evasion on unearned income.\n\nDIRT is deducted at source by financial institutions From 1 January 2014, DIRT is charged at 41% (was 33% in 2013) for payments made annually or more frequently. The tax is deducted by the bank or other deposit-taker before the interest is paid to you. DIRT will be charged at 36% (in 2013, lower rates in previous years) for payments made less frequently.This higher D.I.R.T. rate has been abolished, as and from the 1st January 2014, and the D.I.R.T. rate of 41% applies to any interest paid or credited on these deposits on or after the 1st January 2014.\n\nPersons aged over 65 or incapacitated, whose income is less than the exemption limit (currently €20,000), may claim a refund of DIRT, or may submit an appropriate form to their banks or financial institutions to have interest paid free of DIRT.\n\nDIRT does not apply to:\n\nStamp duty is charged on the conveyance of residential property, non-residential property, and long leases, and also on company share transfers, bank cheques and cards (i.e. ATM cards and credit cards), and insurance policies.\n\nStamp duty is charged as a percentage of the consideration paid for immovable property, including goodwill attached to a business. A stamp duty return must be completed online for all such conveyances; physical stamps are no longer attached to documents.\n\nFirst time buyers (i.e. those who have not purchased a house before in Ireland or in any other jurisdiction) are exempt. One may also qualify as a first-time buyer if newly divorced or separated. New owner-occupied houses or apartments with a floor area of less than 125 m may also be exempt, and new owner-occupied houses with a floor area larger than this are assessed based on the greater of the cost of the site or quarter of the total cost of the house and site. In all cases, the rates exclude VAT.\n\nFor deeds executed on or after 8 December 2010 the rates of stamp duty are:.\n\n\nSince 14 October 2008, conveyances of non-residential property are charged at an increasing rate starting at 0% for a property under the value of €10,000 rising to 6% for transactions over €80,000.\n\nTransfers between spouses are exempt from stamp duty, as are property transfers as a result of a court order in relation to a divorce. The stamp duty rate is halved for transfers between other blood relatives. Intragroup transactions, company reconstructions and amalgamations, and demutualisations, as well as certain transactions involving charities, approved sports bodies, young farmers, woodlands, or intellectual property also attract relief.\n\nThere is a 1% stamp duty on transfers of stock or marketable securities of any company incorporated in Ireland, except paper-based transfers where the consideration is €1,000 or less.\n\nCredit card and charge card accounts are subject to a €30 annual duty. Automated teller machine and debit cards are subject to €2.50 each annually. Cards which perform both functions are subject to the tax twice, i.e. €5 total. Cards that are unused in the entire year are not chargeable. The credit card tax is applied per account, but the ATM and debit card charge is per card. In each case, where an account is closed during the year, there is an exemption from double taxation.\n\nCheques (technically, all bills of exchange) incur a €0.50 tax, generally collected by the bank on issue of each chequebook. Non-life Insurance policies are subject to a 3% levy and Life assurance policies are subject to a 1% levy on premiums from 1 June 2009.\n\nCapital acquisitions tax is charged to the recipient of gifts or inheritances, at the rate of 33% above a tax-free threshold. Gifts and inheritances are gratuitous benefits; the difference is that an inheritance is taken on death and a gift is taken other than on death.\n\nThe person providing the property is called the \"donor\" or \"disponer\", or \"testator\" or \"deceased\" in the case of inheritance; the person receiving the property is called the \"beneficiary\", \"donee\" or \"disponee\", or the \"successor\" in the case of inheritance.\n\nA gift is taken when a donee becomes beneficially entitled in possession to some property without paying full consideration for it. Tax is payable within four months of the date of the gift; an interest charge applies to late payments.\n\nTax is generally charged on the property's taxable value, which is computed as:\n\nMarket value\n\n\"less\" liabilities costs and expenses payable out of the gift or inheritance\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> incumbrance free value\n\n\"less\" consideration paid by acquirer in money or money's worth\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> taxable value\n\nA disposition is taxable in Ireland if it is of property in Ireland, or if either the disponer or the beneficiary was resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland at the date of the disposition. Special rules apply for discretionary trusts.\n\nCAT can be reduced or eliminated altogether under a number of headings.\n\nHistorically group thresholds were indexed by reference to the Consumer Price Index. The indexation of the tax-free group thresholds is abolished for gifts and inheritances taken on or after 7 December 2011. The thresholds on or after 14 October 2015 are:\n\nFor gifts and inheritances taken on or after 5 December 2001, only prior benefits received since 5 December 1991 from the same beneficiary within the same group threshold are aggregated with the current benefit in computing tax payable on the current benefit.\n\nAn inheritance, but not a gift, taken by a parent from his or her child is treated as group A, where it is an immediate interest (but not a life interest) in property. In certain circumstances, the beneficiary may take the place of his/her deceased spouse for the purpose of determining the applicable group where that spouse died before the disponer and was a nearer relative to the disponer.\n\nThe other main exemptions from capital acquisitions tax are:\n\nThe other main reliefs from capital acquisitions tax are:\n\n\nWhen a person receives a gift or inheritance that, either by itself, or aggregated with prior benefits taken by the donee, would place him in a position of having used up more than 80% of any group threshold, he must complete form IT38 and return it to Revenue within four months, along with any tax due.\n\nAssets placed in discretionary trusts are subject to:\nThe charges must be paid within three months of the \"valuation date\", which may be the date the trust was set up, the date of death of the settlor, the earliest date on which the trustees could retain the trust property, the date on which the trustees retained the trust property, or the date of delivery of the trust property to the trustees.\n\nSeveral charges described as taxes are not, in the literal sense, actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still liable for tax on the full amount, but can set the withholding against his overall tax liability. If the amount withheld is less than the tax payable, the recipient is still liable for the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the tax payable, the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a withholding tax, discharges the entire tax liability of the recipient.\n\nRelevant Contracts Tax (RCT) is a withholding regime applied to contractors in the forestry, construction, and meat processing sectors where tax non-compliance levels have historically been high.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, the Minister for Finance signed the Commencement Order for the new electronic RCT system which was introduced on 1 January 2012. All principal contractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors are obliged to engage electronically with Revenue. Under the new RCT system, a principal contractor must provide Revenue with details of the contract and the subcontractor. It must also notify Revenue of all relevant payments online before payment is made. Revenue will respond to the payment notification with a deduction authorisation setting out how much tax, if any, must be withheld. The rates are currently set at 0%, 20% or 35%. This deduction authorisation is sent electronically to the principal contractor. The principal must provide a copy or details of the deduction authorisation to the subcontractor if tax has been deducted. The subcontractor can set off the amount deducted against any tax he is liable to pay, or reclaim the difference where the deduction exceeds the amount of tax.\n\nSince September 2008, the subcontractor no longer charges or accounts for VAT on supplies of construction services to which RCT applies. Instead, the principal contractor must account for the VAT to Revenue (although he will generally be entitled to an input credit for the same amount). This system is referred to as the VAT reverse charge.\n\nDividend Withholding Tax is deducted at the rate of 20% from dividends paid by Irish companies. It can be set off against income tax due, or reclaimed where the recipient of the dividend is not liable to tax.\n\nProfessional Services Withholding Tax (PSWT) is deducted at the rate of 20% from payments made by government bodies, health boards, state bodies, local authorities, and the like, from payments made for professional services. Professional services include medical, dental, pharmaceutical, optical, aural, veterinary, architectural, engineering, quantity surveying, accounting, auditing, finance, marketing, advertising, legal, and geological services, as well as training services supplied to FÁS It can be deducted from the tax ultimately payable by the service provider, or where the provider is non-resident or exempt from tax, reclaimed.\n\nAn assortment of other taxes are charged in Ireland, which do not fit under any other heading.\n\nThis was introduced in the Finance Act of 2013, this Tax is levied for most properties at 0.18% of the self-assessed market value. The value assessed is the value in May 2013 initially. This initial valuation will be used until the next assessment date in November 2016. A higher rate of 0.25% of market value – the so-called \"Mansion Tax\" applies to properties valued at greater than €1,000,000.\n\nSince March 2002, a levy, called the Environmental Levy, has applied to the supply of plastic shopping bags by retailers. The levy is currently 22 cents per plastic bag.\ns\nThe levy does not apply to:\n\nA small bag is one smaller than 225mm wide, 345mm deep, and 450mm long (including handles). The law requires that the levy be passed on to customers.\n\nVehicle Registration Tax or VRT is chargeable on registration of a motor vehicle in Ireland, and every motor vehicle brought into the country, other than temporarily by a visitor, must be registered with Revenue and must have VRT paid for it by the end of the working day after it arrives in the country.\n\nVehicles are assessed under five categories for VRT, depending on the type of vehicle.\n\nMotorcycles and motor scooters are chargeable for VRT by reference to the engine displacement, at a rate of €2 per cc for the first 350cc and €1 per cc thereafter. There is a reduction depending on the age of the vehicle, from 10% after three months to 100% (completely remitted) for vehicles over 30 years old.\n\nElectric vehicles and hybrid vehicles can have a remission or repayment of VRT of up to €2,500 until the end of 2010.\n\nVAT is chargeable (on the VRT-inclusive price) on new vehicles (but not tractors) imported unregistered or within six months of registration outside Ireland, or on vehicles with an odometer reading under 6,000 kilometres at import.\n\nA vehicle on which VRT should have been paid but was not is liable to be seized.\n\nThe owner of a house other than a principal private residence must pay a charge, €200, per year. The charge for 2009 was payable in September, but in subsequent years, it is payable in March.\n\nThe charge applies to \"residential properties\", which includes a house, maisonette, flat, or apartment, but excludes:\n\nAdditionally, the following persons are exempt from paying the charge in respect of the building or buildings in question:\n\nIf the charge is unpaid, it has the effect of a charge in favour of the local council against the property.\n\nA person who moves house is not liable to the charge in respect of either of the houses that year.\n\nMotor tax, payable to the local council where the owner lives, arises when a car or other motor vehicle is used on a public road. A circular receipt, known colloquially as a \"tax disc\", is issued on payment and must be displayed in the front of the vehicle. Certain vehicles, including state-owned vehicles, fire engines, and vehicles for disabled drivers are exempt from motor tax.\n\nMotor tax may be paid for three, six, or 12 months, although paying annually is cheaper. It can be paid online; verification of insurance details is required to get a tax disc.\n\nThe tax for private cars first registered from July 2008 is calculated on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions; for cars registered before that, the rate depends on engine displacement. Goods vehicle tax rates are determined based on gross vehicle weight, the tax for buses is based on the number of seats, and flat rates apply to other types of vehicles.\n\nTax evasion in Ireland, while a common problem historically, is now not as widespread. The reasons are twofold – most people pay at source (PAYE) and the penalties for evasion are high. The Irish Revenue target specific industries every year. Industries have included fast food take away restaurants, banks and farmers.\n\nTax avoidance is a legal process where one's financial affairs are arranged so as to legitimately pay less tax. In some cases the Revenue will pursue individuals or companies who avail of tax avoidance; however their success here is limited because tax avoidance is entirely legal.\n\nThe areas where tax evasion can still be found are businesses that deal in a lot of cash. The trades, small businesses, etc., will sell goods and perform services while accepting cash for the good/service. The buyer will avoid paying VAT at 21% and the seller does not declare the monies for Income Tax. Revenue perform random audits on businesses to discourage and punish this. Businesses are regularly taken to court for tax evasion. Revenue claim a business will be audited roughly every seven years.\n\nOther methods have also been employed by government to combat tax evasion. For example, the introduction of a Taxi Regulator and subsequent regulations for the taxi industry has meant that the opportunities for taxi drivers to avoid declaring cash income have dwindled. By law, taxi drivers must now issue an electronic receipt for each fare, effectively recording their income.\n\nPrior to 1977, all property owners in Ireland had to pay \"rates\" – based on the \"rateable valuation\" of the property – to the local council. Rates were used by local authorities to provide services such as mains water and refuse collection. Rates for private residences were abolished in 1977, with local authorities instead receiving funding from central government. They continue in operation for commercial property.\n\nIn recent years, the government has introduced new local taxes. A charge for water will be introduced by 2014. A bin tax, for domestic refuse collection, was introduced in the last 15 years. Opponents claim that this is double-taxation – that in the aftermath of the abolition of domestic rates in 1977, their taxes were increased to fund local authorities. However, with the ever-rising cost of providing these services, council funding is no longer sufficient to cover costs and user charges would free up council budgets for more worthwhile projects.\n\nMotor tax is paid into the Local Government Fund and is distributed among local authorities.\n\n\n"}

The flag uses the colours of the flag of Scotland, but in the form of the Nordic cross in order to symbolise Shetland's historical and cultural ties with Scandinavia. As with all Scottish flags, its proportions and colour shades are not fixed. It was created by Roy Grønneberg and Bill Adams in 1969, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the transfer of the islands from Norway in the Kalmar Union to Scotland and the 500 years before as part of Norway.\n\nThe flag is widely used privately by Shetlanders both on land and sea and is now seen as a symbol of the Shetland identity. In 2007 a \"Shetland Flag Day\" was introduced by the Council, who hope the day will be used to \"celebrate all things Shetland\". After almost forty years of unofficial use, the flag was formally granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the heraldic authority of Scotland, on 1 February 2005, in time for the Island Games in July 2005 in Shetland. \n\nThe flag is practically identical to the former unofficial national flag of Iceland (the \"Hvítbláinn\") in use by Icelandic nationalist activists from 1897 until 1915, when it was in part abandoned due to its similarity to the Greek jack and the Swedish flag, which critics reasoned would be hard to tell apart at sea, a major issue in a time of war. The white and blue is still used by the Icelandic Youth Association.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973114", "title": "Eric A. Williams", "text": "Eric A. Williams\n\nEric A. Williams was a Trinidad and Tobago politician until November 2007 and was Member of Parliament for Port of Spain South. Until his resignation from the Cabinet in January 2006, he served as the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries in the then People's National Movement government, a post he had held since December 2001. A geologist and geophysicist by training, Williams entered Parliament in 1995 when he won the Port of Spain South seat formerly held by PNM founder Dr. Eric Williams (no relative).\n\nIn a now discredited February 2004 letter to then Prime Minister and Political Leader of the PNM Patrick Manning, PNM Councillor Dansam Dhansook alleged that he had paid a TT$75,000 (approx. US$12,000) bribe to Williams in seven separate payments over the period January to July 2003; one of TT$15,000 and six of TT$10,000. The letter was made public on 27 April 2005, when it was read in the House of Representatives by Prime Minister (as of May 2010) Kamla Persad-Bissessar, United National Congress MP for Siparia. Dhansook has since publicly apologised to Mr Williams, his colleague Mr Franklin Khan, and the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago for his role in this entire matter.\n\nAn article entitled \"Dhansook says I’m sorry\" on Sunday, 13 February 2011, in the \"Trinidad Sunday Guardian\" reads in part:\n\n\"'I am sorry.' Former People’s National Movement councillor, Dansam Dhansook has finally apologised to former PNM ministers Franklin Khan and Eric Williams for the role he played in their wrongful arrests.\nAcknowledging an apology could never suffice the agony and pain both families endured, a visibly stressed Dhansook said the time had come for him to make amends. 'I want to say sorry to the people that I hurt and I was used to hurt; I am sorry. I am very sad about what I did. I am totally disappointed in myself. I am not looking for any sympathy. I made a mistake by trusting a certain individual and I paid the price for it. 'I want to tell the families of Mr Khan and Williams that I am sorry from the depths of my heart. I want to tell the country sorry...I really made a mistake,' a remorseful Dhansook said in a candid interview with Sunday Guardian last week.\n\nBoth ministers were hauled before the court on bribery and corruption allegations made by Dhansook.\nHowever, Williams was freed due to unreliable evidence and charges were dropped against Khan after investigations revealed a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Admitting that he feared for his life, the former Ecclesville councillor who said he had made attempts to correct the 'mess,' claimed that because of scare tactics and lies employed by a certain individual he was manipulated and led down a path of no return, 'one lie after another lie.' 'I wanted to come out and say exactly what happened but I was afraid and was being guided. I have lost everything and I have nothing to lie about anymore. I have nothing to hide anymore,' said Dhansook, whose business has collapsed and his family life almost shattered.\n'I never bribed Mr Khan or Williams. In fact, I never knew Williams,' he confessed.\n'I knew Khan because we were childhood friends. I am sorry for what I did and the hurt I caused,' Dhansook said, as he openly explained the type of business relationship he had shared with Khan.\n\nSnr Supt Solomon Koon Koon of the Anti Corruption Investigations Bureau visited Dhansook last week and questioned him in relation to the matter.\"\n\nOn 7 January 2006 seven warrants for Williams arrest were issued on a charge of misconduct in public office for corruptly receiving $75,000 in 2003. Williams who maintained his innocence, but \"senior government members\" predicted correctly that he would resign his ministerial portfolio on 9 January 2006. On January 9 the seven charges were laid indictably against Williams. He was granted bail of TT$600,000.\n\nNo PNM officials appeared at his hearings over the two-year duration of the Preliminary Inquiry, other than then Mayor of San Fernando Ian Atherly and former Councillor Cynthia Pipier of the Port-of-Spain City Corporation. However, three then Ministers, Fitzgerald Hinds, then a Minister of State and now a Senator in the Opposition, Dr. Keith Rowley (who was being investigated by the Integrity Commission but has since been exhonerated while a member of the Cabinet and is now the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the PNM) and Diane Seukeran, former MP for San Fernando West and then a Minister of State, spoke to the press in his defence.\n\nOn December 31, 2007, all charges against Mr. Williams were dismissed. His accuser Dansam Dhansook was declared to be 'manifestly unreliable as a witness' by Senior Magistrate L. Cardinez-Ragoonanan who presided over the Preliminary Inquiry into the charges.\n\n... Earlier, sitting in the Fourth Court, Magistrate Cardenas-Ragoonanan cited several inconsistencies in the prosecution’s case, the most crucial being that the evidence of its main witness was 'unreliable and inconsistent.'\n\nDuring his testimony, Dhansook, a PNM Councillor and contractor with Terra Seis Seismic Surveys Limited, told the Court that he was at Balisier House when Williams demanded payments from him. However a few moments later Dhansook admitted, when given his original statement to the police to be read out under oath in the court, that on the same day he was at a Christmas party he held for his staff and that he clearly remembered because it was two days before his birthday. Yesterday, Cardenas-Ragoonanan said, “The fact that Mr Dhansook testified he was in two places at the same time when the plan was hatched, sent red flags of uncertainty. It was impossible that he could be at Balisier House (sic in Port of Spain) and at a staff party in Rio Claro, if by virtue of geography alone.' The Magistrate added, 'I find the evidence tenuous...tenuous indeed, vague, uncertain and definitely not enough for any jury to convict on.'\n\nCardenas-Ragoonanan also ruled that there were several flaws in the allegation itself as there was no documented evidence to support whether payments were made to Williams. 'Mr Dhansook was unable to give specific times and occasions when the payments were allegedly made to Mr Williams, his evidence was tenuous, at worst unbelievable, a jury should not have to speculate. Therefore I find it that no prima facie case can be made out against Mr Williams on Dhansook’s evidence,' the magistrate said.\"\n\n"}

It operates domestic and international passenger flights and cargo services to Europe, the Middle East, the United States, Canada, and Asia.\n\nEstablished on 1 October 1992, the airline started operations on 25 November 1992 with a Kiev-London flight. It became one of the first \"joint ventures with foreign capital\" in Ukraine and the first airline in the former Soviet Union to use new Boeing 737-400 aircraft. The founding shareholders were the Ukrainian Association of Civil Aviation and Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), an Irish aircraft-leasing company.\n\nThe airline began cargo operations with a Boeing 737-200 aircraft on 13 November 1994 to London and Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1996, Austrian Airlines and Swissair became shareholders, investing US$9 million in new equity.\n\nIn 2000, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development became a shareholder by investing $5.4 million. In 2006, UIA adopted a new classification-system for freight operations which allowed the airline to carry a wider range of goods, ranging from live animals to fresh food and valuable objects. Additionally, an express service was introduced to meet the needs of customers wishing to make use of expedited cargo-delivery services.\n\nIn the first half of 2013, the airline's traffic rose by 60% to passengers. According to the company's president Yuri Miroshnikov, the UIA planned to achieve the same 2013 yearly results (i.e. to reach yearly traffic of ). On 25 April 2014, UIA began non-stop flights from Kiev to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Also in 2013, due to the demise of competitor Aerosvit, UIA launched new flights from Ukraine to Baku in Azerbaijan, Yerevan in Armenia, Larnaca in Cyprus, Munich in Germany, Warsaw in Poland, Vilnius in Lithuania, Prague in the Czech Republic, Athens in Greece, Batumi in Georgia, Moscow (Sheremetyevo Airport), Yekaterinburg, Saint Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Nizhnevartovsk, Novosibirsk, Rostov-on-Don, and Sochi in Russia, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, and in 2014, New York City in the United States.\n\nIn October 2015, UIA was banned by Russian government from flying to Russian destinations as a response to a ban by Ukrainian government of Russian airlines from flying into Ukraine.\n\nSince June 2016, most of UIA's international flights are sold with the basic \"hand luggage-only tariff\". If passengers are booking this tariff and want to check in luggage, fees up to US$60 per flight will be charged. Also since summer 2016 UIA wetleases an ERJ 145 from Dniproavia (also of the group \"Privat\") for daily services to Chernivtsi (because the condition of the airport doesn't allow E-190 and B737-operations)\n\nOn 14 June 2016, the offices of UIA were searched because of an investigation of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine concerning passenger fees not paid to the State Aviation Fund.\n\nIn March 2018, Ukraine International announced a fleet modernization plan. While the first of three pre-owned Boeing 777-200ER had already been delivered, the airline expects several new Boeing 737 and Embraer 195 aircraft during the year to replace the last Boeing 737 Classics.\n\nUkraine International ceased being a member of the Flying Blue rewards programme as of 1 January 2019. Ukraine International Airlines informs about the delay of 22 flights, which has occurred in the evening of 29 January at Boryspil Airport. The delays were caused by the failure in refueling aircraft with aviation fuel. UIA will continue to write losses with approximately 50m USD for 2019 and therefore implemented saving measures according to the new CEO.\n\nIn February 2011, the Ukrainian government sold its 61.6% stake in UIA to three existing minority shareholders for UAH 287 million  (US$36.2 million). As of 26 July 2013, the airline was owned by Ukraine-based Capital Investment Project LLC (74%) and Cyprus-based Ontobet Promotions Limited (26%). Capital Investment Process, in turn, is owned by Ontobet. The owners are represented by Aron Mayberg, a business partner of Igor Kolomoyskyi and the former CEO of the bankrupt AeroSvit Airlines, from which partially licences and planes were transferred to Ukraine International Airlines.\n\nAs of 22 June 2016, the ownership structure is registered as the following: 74.1627% Capital Investment Project, Ukraine and 15.9108% Ontobet Promotions Ltd, Cyprus.\n\nThis is the second year in a row that the company has made a loss, despite seeing growth in passengers. According to a February statement by company head Yuri Miroshnikov, UIA is struggling to stay profitable in the face of growing competition from budget airlines. In 2017, the company recorded a UAH 304 million loss.\n\nUkraine International Airlines posted a net loss of almost UAH 2.7 billion (about $100 million) in 2018, or about nine times more than it lost in 2017, Ukrainian media reported on 25 March, citing a UIA investor report.\n\nUkraine International Airlines (UIA), the country's national carrier, is to slow down its expansion plans in order to stabilise its financial performance and climb out of the red.\n\nYuri Miroshnikov is stepping down as president of Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) on 12 September after 15 years of managing Ukraine's national carrier and working for UIA since 1993. Evgeny Dykhne will take on the leadership role at UIA from 18 September 2019.\n\nThe head of the state air traffic regulator of Ukraine stated at 8.11.2019 that UIA would owe them actually 1 billion UAH of not paid fees and penalties.\n\nUIA connects Ukraine to over 80 destinations in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as well as to New York City and Toronto from its base at Boryspil Airport, and also operates domestic flights. UIA serves over 1000 flights per week.\nUkraine International Airlines (UIA) was forced to make some involuntary changes to its summer 2019 flight schedules, with reduced frequencies and capacity on some selected routes. Although not officially a budget airline, many of UIA's worldwide flights are popular with travellers because of its low fares, they use Boryspil International Airport as a transport hub. \n\nDue to ongoing losses, the airline suspended flights to Amman, Riga, Beijing and Minsk in November 2019. From 2020, flights to Bangkok and Krakow will also be suspended.\n\nUkraine International Airlines has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:\n, the Ukraine International Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\n\n\n"}

However the original album title is \"Nightlife\".\n\nThe song \"Philomena\" was written for Lynott's mother. \n\nThe album cover, designed by Jim Fitzpatrick, shows a panther-like creature in a city scene. The panther is often thought to be intended to represent Lynott, but Fitzpatrick has confirmed that the panther referred to the Black Panthers and African-American political figures like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described \"Nightlife\" as an \"underrated gem of a record\", but a \"complete anomaly within their catalog\"... \"a subdued, soulful record, smooth in ways that Thin Lizzy never were before and rarely were afterwards\". He singles out \"She Knows\" as \"gently propulsive, [and] utterly addictive\", but adds that there are \"still moments of tough, primal rock 'n' roll\", such as \"It's Only Money\" and \"Sha La La\".

The film stars Vikram, Suriya and Laila in the lead roles. Produced by V. A. Durai, the film has cinematography by Balasubramaniem, lyrics are by Vaali, Pazhani Bharathi and Na. Muthukumar, dance has been choreographed by Brindha, editing by Suresh Urs, fights by Stun Siva and art direction by A. C. Pillai. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by Ilayaraaja. The film plot is based on Jayakanthan's \"Nandhavanathil Oru Andi\", the story of an undertaker. Upon release, the film met with critical acclaim and Vikram won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his role as Chithan. Owing to the success, the film was dubbed into Telugu and released as \"Sivaputrudu\" (The son of Siva) on 2 April 2004. The film was also remade in Kannada as \"Anatharu\" (2007). It was also dubbed in Hindi as same title by B4U Movies.\n\nAn anonymous woman dies while giving birth in a graveyard. Her child, Chithan, is found and raised by the caretaker of the graveyard. Chithan grows up among corpses with minimal human contact and is perhaps more feral than autistic. He growls like a wolf, runs like a gorilla, has the unkempt appearance of an orangutan, but seems to understand loyalty and is (despite his circumstance) a social animal. He ventures into a town in search of food and gets into trouble as he does not understand the concept of money. He is rescued by Gomathi, a petty ganja seller. She sees his ability to be loyal and enrolls him into the service of her employer, a large scale ganja producer. Chithan is caught during a drug raid and is arrested.\n\nSakthi is a conman with a silver tongue. He gets into trouble when he cons a woman named Manju into losing all her personal effects in a game of dice. Sakthi gets sent to jail thanks to Manju's detective work. He meets Chithan in prison and starts protecting him out of sympathy and pity. Chithan starts to reciprocate to Sakthi's kindness with the only way he knows: by being as loyal as a dog.\n\nSakthi serves his term and then butts heads with the ganja producer to get Chithan out of jail. Chithan gets out but commits a crime when he obeys his master's instruction to burn the body of a murder victim. Sakthi, realising that Chithan is being used as accessory in crimes that he cannot comprehend, prevents Chithan from going back to working in the ganja fields. At the same time, a budding romance starts between Sakthi and Manju. Chithan too starts to see a shared spirit in Gomathi.\n\nThe police catches a wind of the murder and arrests Chithan. Sakthi gets Chithan to side with the police and goes against the ganja producer. The ganja producer later attacks and kills Sakthi and dumps his body in the middle of the road - all of this when Chithan is not around. Chithan does not understand that Sakthi is dead and zones out to outer space when everyone surrounds him. Gomathi, Manju, and the others are crying. Gomathi sees Chithan's confusion as indifference and angrily drives him away from Sakthi's body.\n\nChithan slowly starts to understand that Shakthi is dead as he sees him on the funeral pyre. His realization is complete when he wakes up in the morning next to the burnt remains of Shakthi's corpse. He experiences emotions that he has never experienced before: fury, agony, betrayal, and emotional pain that he has never felt. His body bears the scars of a million bruises, and his violence has always been self-defense and the defense of his masters. This realization of the meaning of death and the pain of losing a loved one breaks the feral chains that had wound up on his psyche.\n\nChithan then sets out like a man intent on destroying the world. He sets fire to the ganja fields, lets the ganja producer experience the pain of his loss, and then sets upon destroying him physically. He drives him through the street, taking his time by breaking a few bones at a time until he is done toying with him. He then kills the ganja producer and offers his body as a tribute to Manju, who now has lost her will to live.\n\nGomathi realizes what Chithan has been through and tries to get him to stay. However, Chithan turns back to the world of the graveyard among the corpses that cannot hurt him anymore.\n\nAfter \"Nandha\", Bala announced his next project \"Pithamagan\" with Vikram and Suriya, heroes of his previous films who received popularity after struggle. For Gomathy's role, Bala selected Simran and confirmed her for the role by printing her name in invitations,but she was hurry to finish all her commitments due to her wedding plans and she accepted to give only 3 days call sheet to make special appearance initially which was offered to Reemma Sen. After that Vijayashanti, Malavika and Gayatri Jayaraman were considered but at last Rasika was selected for the role and also changed her name back to Sangeetha.\n\nMost part of the Film was shot in a town called Bodinayakanur in Theni District. Bodinayakanur, which is surrounded by Western Ghats Hills and also known as the Cardamom Capital of India.\n\nThe soundtrack album was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.

Malathi Rangarajan of \"The Hindu\" praised Vikram as \"Without any dialogue to support him he carves a niche for himself in the viewer's mind with his expressions and excellent body language\" and Suriya as \"Who would have thought that this young man, pitted against the serious Chithan, would prove so perfect a foil?\" going on to declare the movie as \"..a symphony on celluloid\". Balaji Balasubramaniam of \"Thiraipadam.com\" reviewed as \"With unique characterization, tremendous performances and a smooth screenplay, the movie offers a satisfying experience to the discerning viewer...\" and noted \"Vikram pretty much lives the role of the undertaker. With dry and streaked hair, dirty teeth and torn clothes, he looks the part and though he doesn't utter a word, he conveys everything through his expressions and body language\".

{"id": "1973144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973144", "title": "Tim Maia", "text": "Tim Maia\n\nTim Maia (, born Sebastião Rodrigues Maia; September 28, 1942 – March 15, 1998) was a Brazilian musician, songwriter and businessman known for his iconoclastic, ironic, outspoken, and humorous musical style. Maia contributed to Brazilian music within a wide variety of musical genres, including soul, funk, bossa nova, disco, romantic ballads, pop, rock, jazz, baião and MPB. He introduced the soul style on the Brazilian musical scene. Along with Jorge Ben, Maia pioneered MPB's samba rock genre, combining samba, soul, and funk. He is internationally recognized as one of the biggest icons of the Brazilian music.\n\nTim Maia recorded numerous albums and toured extensively in a long career. After his early death in 1998, his recorded oeuvre has shown enduring popularity. A theatrical retrospective of his career, the popular musical \"Vale Tudo\", was first staged in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.\n\nMaia was born in the Tijuca neighbourhood, in the northern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. He began writing melodies while still a child, the second youngest of nineteen children. Then known as \"Tião Maia\", he wrote his earliest songs at age eight. At fourteen, as a drummer, he formed the group Os Tijucanos do Ritmo, which lasted one year. He then took guitar classes and was soon teaching other children in Tijuca. He also gave lessons to his friends Erasmo Esteves and Roberto Carlos, fellow members of the so-called Matoso Gang. Named after the street where they used to hang out, the gang also included Jorge Ben and Erasmo Carlos, among others. They liked to listen to the earliest styles of rock and roll, with both Maia and Ben being nicknamed \"Babulina\" after their enthusiastic pronunciation of Ronnie Self's rockabilly song \"Bop-A-Lena\".\n\nIn 1957, Maia, Carlos, Arlênio Silva, Edson Trindade and Wellington started the vocal group The Sputniks. After a televised appearance on Carlos Imperial's \"Clube do Rock\" on TV Tupi, Imperial arranged a solo appearance for Roberto Carlos the following week. Maia got annoyed at this, leading him to insult Carlos in the following rehearsals until his bandmate left the group. After watching Carlos' concert the following week, Maia left The Sputniks, and went after Imperial for a solo appearance. Imperial eventually suggested another artistic name, Tim, which Maia accepted with reservations.\n\nIn 1959, Maia went to study in the United States, where he lived for four years. He joined a vocal harmony ensemble, The Ideals, and wrote the lyrics to \"New Love\", which was recorded as a demo with guest percussion by a young Milton Banana. (Maia also recorded the song as a soloist in 1973). The group's career was derailed in 1963 when Maia was arrested for possession of marijuana and deported back to Brazil.\n\nAfter returning, Maia had a few unsuccessful jobs and arrests in Rio. Eventually he decided to move to São Paulo to try to get help to kickstart his musical career from Carlos, who was beginning to enjoy the massive success of Jovem Guarda with Esteves. Carlos was inaccessible, but Maia started to perform in São Paulo's nightlife and in Wilson Simonal's radio program, and also had a televised appearance at TV Bandeirantes with Os Mutantes. By the end of 1967 Maia managed to send a homemade recording to Carlos, who got Maia a deal for a single at CBS and an appearance on the \"Jovem Guarda\" TV program. His first single in 1968, \"Meu País\" backed by \"Sentimento\", went unnoticed, as was another single, \"These Are the Songs\"/\"What Do You Want to Bet?\", recorded in English for RGE Discos. Maia also wrote one of Carlos' hits, \"Não Vou Ficar\". He became more visible after 1969 when he launched his \"These Are the Songs,\" which was re-recorded by Elis Regina in the next year in a duo with Maia. Maia managed a deal with Polydor/Philips and recorded the successful single \"Primavera\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Maia started to record albums and perform shows promoting his synthesis of American soul and Brazilian music with elements of samba and baião. The movement gradually took the working-class suburbs of the north side of Rio de Janeiro, exploding in 1976 with the black movement.\n\nIn 1970, Maia recorded his first full-length LP, \"Tim Maia\", which included the classics \"Azul da Cor do Mar\", \"Coroné Antônio Bento\", and \"Primavera\", and topped the charts for 24 weeks in Rio de Janeiro. His first four albums were all self-titled. Next year's \"Tim Maia\" had other hits including \"Não Quero Dinheiro (Só Quero Amar)\" and \"Preciso Aprender a Ser Só\". His fourth album, released in 1973, included \"Réu Confesso\" and \"Gostava Tanto de Você\". Angry at how the music publisher distributed the royalties, Maia opened his own, Seroma (derived from the first syllables of his first, middle and last names), to make sure he had a bigger cut of the profits.\n\nAfter his fourth album, Maia left Polydor for RCA Victor, who offered him a chance to record a double album. The instrumental parts were all ready when Maia went to his composing friend Tibério Gaspar for help with the lyrics. In his house Maia found the book \"Universo em Desencanto\" (Disenchanting Universe), revolving around the cult of Rational Culture. Maia converted to the cult, abandoned the drugs and red meat, and decided to write the lyrics for the songs about the knowledge contained in the book. RCA rejected the albums \"Tim Maia Racional, Vols. 1 & 2\" for the newly found spiritual content, but Maia bought the master tapes from them and released the albums independently through label Seroma Discos, which would split its profits with the cult. While the lead single \"Que Beleza (Imunização Racional)\" had some airplay, at the time these records were not well received, due to inadequate distribution, and the spiritual content alienating both the radios and Maia's fans. Eventually, the artist could only perform at events promoted by the Rational Culture. Eventually in 1975, Maia got fed up with the cult, destroyed the unsold records and went back to his carefree life. The \"Racional\" albums are now regarded as classics and saw re-release in 2005.\n\nFor his return in 1976, Maia signed with Polygram and recorded an album also titled \"Tim Maia\", which included the hit \"Rodésia\" (inspired by the Rhodesian Bush War), and also did a self-published album in English. In 1977 Maia signed with Som Livre, where he recorded the album \"Verão Carioca\". In 1978 Maia signed with Warner Bros. Records and incorporated the disco sound of the period in the album \"Tim Maia Disco Club\", which spawned the hits \"Sossego\" and \"Acenda o Farol\". In 1979 Maia recorded \"Reencontro\" for EMI-Odeon, but revolted at the label's estimated promotion costs which were the same as the money spent recording, Maia fought with the marketing executive, and in response EMI president fired Maia, releasing the album with no publicity to low sales.\n\nIn 1980, Maia recorded another self-titled album for Polygram. The following year, with turbulent passages through all the major labels in Brazil, Maia released again through Seroma the album \"Nuvens\", which flopped due to inefficient distribution. To earn cash for his future albums, Maia was a guest in songs by Fevers, Edu Lobo and Chico Buarque, Ivan Lins and Sandra de Sá. His collaboration with Sá, \"Vale Tudo\", later became a solo hit for Maia.\nIn 1983 he had hits with \"O Descobridor dos Sete Mares\" and \"Me Dê Motivo\", included on \"O Descobridor dos Sete Mares\" (Polygram). Another milestone of his career in the 1980s was \"Tim Maia\" (1986), which had the hit \"Do Leme ao Pontal (Tomo Guaraná, Suco de Caju, Goiabada Para Sobremesa)\".\n\nIn 1990, Maia saw Caetano Veloso's songbook and asked editor Almir Chediak to do one for his own work. Chediak was working on such an album with bossa nova classics, and Maia requested a copy, which eventually inspired him to do a self-released album of bossa nova covers, \"Tim Maia Interpreta Clássicos da Bossa Nova\". After a period of poor presence in the media, he was again on top after being mentioned by Jorge Ben Jor's \"W/Brasil\" in 1991. In the same period, Maia had another hit with his re-recording of Lulu Santos' \"Como uma Onda\" for a television advertisement – Santos in return recorded Maia's \"Descobridor dos Sete Mares.\n\nAt the same time, he withdrew from majors, recording his next albums through Vitória Régia, including \"What a Wonderful World\" (1997), where he recorded American pop/soul classics, and \"Amigos do Rei/Tim Maia e Os Cariocas\", with the famous vocal group. Obese and in bad health, in March 8, 1998 he was performing at the Municipal Theater of Niterói when he became ill. He was hospitalized and died a few days later.\n\nMaia lived in the United States of America from 1959 to 1963. He first resided in Tarrytown, New York, with the family of an acquaintance of Maia's father's costumer. There he learned English and did not speak much Portuguese because so few Brazilians were living in the US at the time. In 1961, Maia moved to New York City, and, in 1963, with a group of three friends, decided to travel to Southern United States. With a stolen car and performing small thefts to finance the journey (which got him arrested five times), Maia and friends traveled through nine states before arriving in Florida. In Daytona Beach, Maia had his final imprisonment for marijuana possession, which earned him deportation back to Brazil.\n\nHe had three sons. The first was José Carlos da Silva Nogueira (b. 1966). Maia only met Nogueira when he was already 15. Maia never legally recognized Nogueira as a son, but the two reportedly had a good relationship. A sister of Maia claims that, once he found out about Nogueira, he allowed the boy to live in one of his properties and helped him financially. Nogueira was shot and killed in 2002, in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, four years after Maia's death.\n\nMaia had a live-in girlfriend, Maria de Jesus \"Geisa\" Gomes da Silva. After some time together, they broke up. When they made up, she was pregnant with a boy, whose father refused to recognize the child as his. Maia then adopted the boy, Marcio Leonardo \"Léo\" Maia (b. 1974). Afterwards, Maia and Geisa married and had another son, Carmelo \"Telmo\" Maia (b. 1975). When Léo was 12, Tim Maia and Geisa divorced.\n\nTim Maia became a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (\"Partido Socialista Brasileiro – PSB\") in October 1997. He was rumoured to have joined the party in order to run for a seat in the Federal Senate for Rio de Janeiro in the 1998 general elections, but died before that. When asked by a reporter why he chose to join the then small PSB, he replied: \"\"Brazil is the only country where – in addition to whores cumming, pimps being jealous and drug dealers being addicted – poor people vote for the right-wing\"\". His phrase would become a famous aphorism on the way Brazilians face politics.\n\nHe was also known for his easygoing lifestyle, and for his habit of lightheartedly missing appointments and even important gigs. Indeed, Maia had a tradition of arriving late at concerts, at times missing them altogether. He also frequently complained about the sound quality in them. Many of his missed concerts were due to what he called his \"triathlon\": consuming whiskey, cocaine and marijuana before a gig. Towards the end of his life, Tim Maia suffered from many health problems, which included diabetes, acute hypertension, obesity and pulmonary embolism. In 1996, he had a Fournier gangrene solved through an emergency operation.\n\nAfter his death, Maia was the subject of numerous tributes by Música popular brasileira artists; two lavish commemorations in 1999 and 2000 were each released on CD and DVD. A biography, \"Vale Tudo – O Som e a Fúria de Tim Maia\", was published in 2011 by one of Maia's personal friends, Nelson Motta. Motta later worked with João Fonseca on a stage version of the book – their musical retrospective \"Tim Maia: Vale Tudo\" began a successful theatrical run in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The film adaptation \"Tim Maia\" based on the book was released in 2014.\n\nIn 2004, Som Livre released an album of posthumous duets entitled \"Soul Tim: Duetos\". Maia's entire discography, including the never before seen third volume of \"Tim Maia Racional\", was reissued by Editora Abril in 2011. In October 2012, American record label Luaka Bop released a Maia compilation entitled \"Nobody Can Live Forever.\"\n\nIn January 2001, Guns N' Roses guitarist Robin Finck sang \"Sossego\" during the Rock in Rio III festival. In 2007, TV Globo recorded a special program about Maia, \"Por Toda a Minha Vida\", and in 2009, Globo had an episode of its show \"Som Brasil\" with Maia's songs, performed by his son Léo and Seu Jorge among other artists. TV Cultura (São Paulo's public broadcasting) released in 2012 of their \"Ensaio\" music program.\n\nMaia released his first album in 1970 and recorded frequently throughout his career. The following is a representative list drawn from his extensive catalog:\n\n"}

He was enshrined into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2008, he was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. He is widely considered as one of the best shooters in the history of European basketball.\n\nBorn in Tuzla to Bosnian Muslim parents, father Izet Delibašić from Kakanj and mother Zajkana \"Duda\" Mehičević from Ljubuški, young Mirza took up tennis and excelled at it. By the age of fourteen, he switched to basketball.\n\nMirza Delibašić, nicknamed Kinđe, led his club Bosna to the EuroLeague Championship in 1979. He played his first games at age of 15 for KK Sloboda Dita, Tuzla's basketball club. Three years later, in 1971, he signed a contract with KK Bosna. After leaving Bosna, Delibašić went to the Spanish Primera División, where he ended up being considered one of the best players ever to play for Real Madrid, along with the likes of Juan Corbalán, Wayne Brabender, Fernando Martín Espina, Fernando Romay, Dražen Petrović, and Arvydas Sabonis.\n\nIn his club career, he won numerous titles in European club competitions. In addition to having played together for their Yugoslav national team, Mirza Delibašić and Dražen Dalipagić, also played together with Real Madrid. Their performance in a 1983 EuroLeague game versus Cibona, in Zagreb, is only one of the many highlights of their careers. In that game, Delibašić scored 26 points and Dalipagić 33. The game appropriately finished with a two-on-one fast-break, with Delibašić making a behind-the-back fake pass to Dalipagić, and passing by a defender for a two-handed dunk at the buzzer. Cibona's fans put aside their team's loss in the game, and showed their appreciation for the Bosnian stars performances, with a standing ovation at the end of the game.\n\nIn early summer 1983, the then twenty-nine-year-old Delibašić left Real Madrid and signed with the Italian League club JuveCaserta, which was at the time coached by his former Bosna mentor Bogdan Tanjević.\n\nIn August 1983, the team went to preseason training and conditioning, to the town of Bormio, in the Italian Alps. After coming back south to Caserta, following the grueling altitude training, Delibašić suffered a near-fatal brain hemorrhage that would turn out to be career-ending. Being in a critical condition, a private plane was immediately organized for him to be airlifted to the Military Medical Academy (VMA) in Belgrade, where he was hospitalized for months. He survived and recovered, but not enough to return to playing basketball, thus forcing him to permanently retire from playing, effective immediately.\n\nEn route to a place among the greatest European players, Mirza Delibašić won every major FIBA tournament with the senior Yugoslavian national basketball team, including: the Summer Olympic Games gold medal, at the 1980 Summer Olympics, EuroBasket gold two times (1975 EuroBasket and 1977 EuroBasket), and the FIBA World Cup gold at the 1978 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\nDelibašić lived in Sarajevo throughout the 1992-1996 siege of the city. Simultaneously, Delibašić coached the newly-established Bosnian national basketball team at EuroBasket 1993 in Germany, where they finished in 8th place. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Delibašić married his girlfriend Branka. Their son Dario was born in December 1979. The couple divorced in 1980, after Delibašić moved abroad to play with Real Madrid.\n\nIn 1986, Delibašić, then retired from playing basketball and performing an administrative role at KK Bosna, married Slavica Šuka, an active basketball player with ŽKK Bosna. The same year in October, the couple had a son named Danko.\n\nDelibašić's final years were marked by persistent health problems, due to his heavy drinking, which led to his death in 2001, at the age of 47, in Sarajevo. He is interred next to singer Davorin Popović (who died earlier that year), in the Alley of Greats at Bare Cemetery. His funeral was attended by thousands. After his death, KK Bosna renamed its arena in his honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1973155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973155", "title": "Parasaurolophus", "text": "Parasaurolophus\n\nParasaurolophus (; meaning \"near crested lizard\" in reference to \"Saurolophus\") is a genus of herbivorous ornithopod dinosaur that lived in what is now North America and possibly Asia during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 76.5–73 million years ago. It was an herbivore that walked both as a biped and as a quadruped. Three species are universally recognized: \"P. walkeri\" (the type species), \"P. tubicen\", and the short-crested \"P. cyrtocristatus\". Additionally, a fourth species, \"P. jiayensis\", has been proposed, although it is more commonly placed in the separate genus \"Charonosaurus\". Remains are known from Alberta (Canada), New Mexico and Utah (United States), and possibly Heilongjiang, (China). The genus was first described in 1922 by William Parks from a skull and partial skeleton found in Alberta.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus\" was a hadrosaurid, part of a diverse family of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull. \"Charonosaurus\" from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. Visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and thermoregulation have been proposed as functional explanations for the crest. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens.\n\nLike most dinosaurs, the skeleton of \"Parasaurolophus\" is incompletely known. The length of the type specimen of \"P. walkeri\" is estimated at , and its weight is estimated at . Its skull is about long, including the crest, whereas the type skull of \"P. tubicen\" is over long, indicating a larger animal. Its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid, with a short but wide shoulder blade. The thighbone measures long in \"P. walkeri\" and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids. The upper arm and pelvic bones were also heavily built.\n\nLike other hadrosaurids, it was able to walk on either two legs or four. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for \"P. walkeri\", showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.\n\nThe most noticeable feature was the cranial crest, which protruded from the rear of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones. William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a ligament ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence. Although this idea seems unlikely, \"Parasaurolophus\" is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in \"P. walkeri\", and more complex in \"P. tubicen\", where some tubes were blind and others met and separated. While \"P. walkeri\" and \"P. tubicen\" had long crests with only slight curvature, \"P. cyrtocristatus\" had a short crest with a more circular profile.\n\nMeaning \"near crested lizard\", the name \"Parasaurolophus\" is derived from the Greek \"para\"/παρα \"beside\" or \"near\", \"saurus\"/σαυρος \"lizard\" and \"lophos\"/λοφος \"crest\". It is based on ROM 768, a skull and partial skeleton missing most of the tail and the hind legs below the knees, which was found by a field party from the University of Toronto in 1920 near Sand Creek along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. These rocks are now known as the Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation. William Parks named the specimen \"P. walkeri\" in honor of Sir Byron Edmund Walker, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Ontario Museum. \"Parasaurolophus\" remains are rare in Alberta, with only one other partial skull from (probably) the Dinosaur Park Formation, and three Dinosaur Park specimens lacking skulls, possibly belonging to the genus. In some faunal lists, there is a mention of possible \"P. walkeri\" material in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, a rock unit of late Maastrichtian age. This occurrence is not noted by Sullivan and Williamson in their 1999 review of the genus, and has not been further elaborated upon elsewhere.\n\nIn 1921, Charles H. Sternberg recovered a partial skull (PMU.R1250) from what is now known as the slightly younger Kirtland Formation in San Juan County, New Mexico. This specimen was sent to Uppsala, Sweden, where Carl Wiman described it as a second species, \"P. tubicen\", in 1931. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin \"tǔbǐcěn\" \"trumpeter\". A second, nearly complete \"P. tubicen\" skull (NMMNH P-25100) was found in New Mexico in 1995. Using computed tomography of this skull, Robert Sullivan and Thomas Williamson gave the genus a monographic treatment in 1999, covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy, and the functions of its crest. Williamson later published an independent review of the remains, disagreeing with the taxonomic conclusions.\n\nJohn Ostrom described another good specimen (FMNH P27393) from New Mexico as \"P. cyrtocristatus\" in 1961. It includes a partial skull with a short, rounded crest, and much of the postcranial skeleton except for the feet, neck, and parts of the tail. Its specific name is derived from the Latin \"curtus\" \"shortened\" and \"cristatus\" \"crested\". The specimen was found in either the top of the Fruitland Formation or, more likely, the base of the overlying Kirtland Formation. The range of this species was expanded in 1979, when David B. Weishampel and James A. Jensen described a partial skull with a similar crest (BYU 2467) from the Campanian-age Kaiparowits Formation of Garfield County, Utah. Since then, another skull has been found in Utah with the short/round \"P. cyrtocristatus\" crest morphology.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus\" is known from three certain species, \"P. walkeri\", \"P. tubicen\", and \"P. cyrtocristatus\". All of them can be distinguished from each other, and have many differences. The first named species, therefore the type, is \"P. walkeri\". One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it, but many more are almost certainly referable. Like stated above, it is different from the other two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than \"P. tubicen\", a straighter crest and different internal structuring than \"P. cyrtocristatus\".\n\nThe next named species is \"P. tubicen\", which is the largest of the \"Parasaurolophus\" species. It lived in New Mexico, where three specimens are known, and can be differentiated from its other species. It possesses a long and straight crest, with a very complex interior compared to the other species. All known specimens of \"P. tubicen\" come from the De-Na-Zin Member of the Kirtland Formation.\nIn 1961, the third species, \"P. cyrtocristatus\" was named by John Ostrom. Its three known specimens, have been found in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits formations from Utah and New Mexico. The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally unassigned to a specific taxon. Of the \"Parasaurolophus\" species, \"P. cyrtocristatus\" it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest. Because of its possession of the two above features, it has often been speculated that it was a female of \"P. walkeri\" or \"P. tubicen\", which were males, although \"P. tubicen\" lived approximately a million years later. As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of \"P. cyrtocristatus\" is about 72% the size of \"P. tubicen\", close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests (~70% of adult size). Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of \"P. cyrtocristatus\" being a female, many other studies have found that it is not, because of the differences in age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure.\n\nA study published in \"PLoS ONE\" in 2014 found that one more species could be referred to \"Parasaurolophus\". This study, led by Xing, found \"Charonosaurus jiayensis\" was actually nested deeply inside \"Parasaurolophus\", which created the new species \"P. jiayensis\". If this species is indeed inside \"Parasaurolophus\", then the genus lasted until the K-Pg extinction, and is known from two continents.\n\nAs its name implies, \"Parasaurolophus\" was initially thought to be closely related to \"Saurolophus\" because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed as a member of the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—\"Saurolophus\" is a hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested \"Corythosaurus\", \"Hypacrosaurus\", and \"Lambeosaurus\". Its closest known relative appears to be \"Charonosaurus\", a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. \"P. cyrtocristatus\", with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known \"Parasaurolophus\" species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of \"P. tubicen\".\n\nThe following cladogram is after the 2007 redescription of \"Lambeosaurus magnicristatus\" (Evans and Reisz, 2007):\n\nAs a hadrosaurid, \"Parasaurolophus\" was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually being replaced; they were packed into dental batteries containing hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Vegetation could have been taken from the ground up to a height of around . As noted by Bob Bakker, lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, implying that \"Parasaurolophus\" and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus\" is known from many adult specimens, and a juvenile described in 2013. The juvenile was discovered in the Kaiparowits Formation in 2009. Excavated by the joint expedition by The Webb Schools and Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology (RAM), the juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died. Referred to \"Parasaurolophus\" sp., the juvenile, under specimen number RAM 14000, is the most complete, as well as youngest \"Parasaurolophus\" ever found, and measures . This individual fits neatly into the currently known \"Parasaurolophus\" growth stages, and lived approximately 75 million years ago. Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult \"Parasaurolophus\" has been found yet, a partial braincase of about the right size is known. At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of \"Parasaurolophus\" began sooner than in related genera, such as \"Corythosaurus\". It has been suggested that \"Parasaurolophus\" adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related \"Corythosaurus\", because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that \"Parasaurolophus\" had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical.\n\nThe skull of RAM 14000 is almost complete, with the left side only lacking a piece of the maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, possibly when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.\n\nA partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, the first ever for a \"Parasaurolophus\" of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on the portion of the braincase articulated with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.\n\nMany hypotheses have been advanced as to what functions the cranial crest of \"Parasaurolophus\" performed, but most have been discredited. It is now believed that it may have had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times in the evolution of the crest and its internal nasal passages.\n\nAs for other lambeosaurines, it is believed that the cranial crest of \"Parasaurolophus\" changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that \"P. cyrtocristatus\", with its small crest, was the female form of \"P. tubicen\". Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile \"Parasaurolophus\" probably had small, rounded crests like \"P. cyrtocristatus\", that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to \"Lambeosaurus\", now assigned to \"Parasaurolophus\", provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in \"Parasaurolophus\" and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the \"Corythosaurus\"-\"Hypacrosaurus\"-\"Lambeosaurus\" model, in part because the crest of \"Parasaurolophus\" lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.\n\nMany early suggestions focused on adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following the hypothesis that hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s. Thus, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed it served as a snorkel, Martin Wilfarth that it was an attachment for a mobile proboscis used as a breathing tube or for food gathering, Charles M. Sternberg that it served as an airtrap to keep water out of the lungs, and Ned Colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater.\n\nOther proposals were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks suggested that it was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles, and helped with moving and supporting the head. Othenio Abel proposed it was used as a weapon in combat among members of the same species, and Andrew Milner suggested that it could be used as a foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the cassowary. Still, other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. Halszka Osmólska suggested that it housed salt glands, and John Ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities.\n\nMost of these hypotheses have been discredited or rejected. For example, there is no hole at the end of the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of \"Parasaurolophus\". Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.\n\nThe large surface area and vascularization of the crest also suggests a thermoregulatory function. The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed that there was a nerve connection between the crest and the brain, so that the latter could be cooled by the former. The next people to publish a related idea were Teresa Maryańska and Osmólska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation. In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why this could be a causing factor for the evolution of the crest.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus\" is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described \"P. tubicen\". He noted that the crests internal structures are similar to those of a swan and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of \"Hypacrosaurus\", \"Corythosaurus\", and \"Lambeosaurus\" are much more variable and complicated than the airway of \"Parasaurolophus\". A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of \"Parasaurolophus\" was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that \"Parasaurolophus\" made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in \"P. cyrtocristatus\" (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had a strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related \"Corythosaurus\", of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on the similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.\n\nComputer modeling of a well-preserved specimen of \"P. tubicen\", with more complex air passages than those of \"P. walkeri\", has allowed the reconstruction of the possible sound its crest produced. The main path resonates at around 30 Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.\nThe other main behavioral theory is that the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in \"Parasaurolophus\" and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of \"Parasaurolophus\" likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from \"Corythosaurus\" or \"Lambeosaurus\") and sexual identification by shape and size.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus walkeri\" is known from one specimen which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae at the base of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of \"Parasaurolophus\" restore the skin flap.\n\nAnother possible pathology was noticed by Parks, and from around the notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, with the other two possessing a swelling at the base of the break.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus walkeri\", from the Dinosaur Park Formation, was a member of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the horned \"Centrosaurus\", \"Chasmosaurus\", and \"Styracosaurus\"; fellow duckbills \"Gryposaurus\" and \"Corythosaurus\"; tyrannosaurid \"Gorgosaurus\"; and armored \"Edmontonia\", \"Euoplocephalus\" and \"Dyoplosaurus\". It was a rare constituent of this fauna. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.\n\nSome of the less common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as \"Parasaurolophus\", may represent the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of \"Parasaurolophus\" and \"Kritosaurus\" in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with \"Pentaceratops\", they are predominate members of the fauna.\n\nIn the Fruitland Formation of New Mexico, \"P. cyrtocristatus\" shared its habitat with other ornithischians and theropods. Specifically, its contemporaries were the ceratopsian \"Pentaceratops sternbergii\"; the pachycephalosaur \"Stegoceras novomexicanum\"; and some unidentified fossils belonging to Tyrannosauridae, ?\"Ornithomimus\", ?Troodontidae, ?\"Saurornitholestes langstoni\", ?\"Struthiomimus\", Ornithopoda, ?\"Chasmosaurus\", ?\"Corythosaurus\", Hadrosaurinae, Hadrosauridae, and Ceratopsidae. When \"Parasaurolophus\" existed, the Fruitland Formation was swampy, positioned in the lowlands, and close to the shore of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The lowermost part of the Fruitland Formation is just younger than 75.56 ± 0.41 mya, with the uppermost boundary dating to 74.55 ± 0.22 mya.\n\nExisting slightly later than the species from the Fruitland Formation, \"P. tubicen\" is also found in New Mexico, in the Kirtland Formation. Numerous vertebrate groups are from this formation, including fishes, crurotarsans, ornithischians, saurischians, pterosaurs, and turtles. The fishes are represented by the two species \"Melvius chauliodous\" and \"Myledalphus bipartitus\". The crurotarsans include \"Brachychampsa montana\" and \"Denazinosuchus kirtlandicus\". Ornithischians from the formation are represented by the hadrosaurids \"Anasazisaurus horneri\", \"Naashoibitosaurus ostromi\", \"Kritosaurus navajovius\", and \"P. tubicen\"; the ankylosaurids \"Ahshislepelta minor\" and \"Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis\"; the ceratopsians \"Pentaceratops sternbergii\" and \"Titanoceratops ouranos\"; and the pachycephalosaurs \"Stegoceras novomexicanum\" and \"Sphaerotholus goodwini\". Saurischians include the tyrannosaurid \"Bistahieversor sealeyi\"; the ornithomimid \"Ornithomimus\" sp.; and the troodontid \"Saurornitholestes\" \"robustus\". One pterosaur is known, named \"Navajodactylus boerei\". Turtles are fairly plentiful, and are known from \"Denazinemys nodosa\", \"Basilemys nobilis\", \"Neurankylus baueri\", \"Plastomenus robustus\". and \"Thescelus hemispherica\". Unidentified taxa are known, including the crurotarsan ?\"Leidyosuchus\", and the theropods ?\"Struthiomimus\", Troodontidae and Tyrannosauridae. The beginning of the Kirtland Formation dates to 74.55 ± 0.22 mya, with the formation ending at around 73.05 ± 0.25 mya.\n\nArgon-argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.6 and 74.5 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.\n\n\"Parasaurolophus\" shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as dromaeosaurid theropods, the troodontid \"Talos sampsoni\", ornithomimids like \"Ornithomimus velox\", tyrannosaurids like \"Albertosaurus\" and \"Teratophoneus\", armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaur \"Gryposaurus monumentensis\", the ceratopsians \"Utahceratops gettyi\", \"Nasutoceratops titusi\" and \"Kosmoceratops richardsoni\" and the oviraptorosaurian \"Hagryphus giganteus\". Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.\n\n\n"}

Arithmetic geometry is centered around Diophantine geometry, the study of rational points of algebraic varieties.\n\nIn more abstract terms, arithmetic geometry can be defined as the study of schemes of finite type over the spectrum of the ring of integers.\n\nThe classical objects of interest in arithmetic geometry are rational points: sets of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over number fields, finite fields, p-adic fields, or function fields, i.e. fields that are not algebraically closed excluding the real numbers. Rational points can be directly characterized by height functions which measure their arithmetic complexity.\n\nThe structure of algebraic varieties defined over non-algebraically-closed fields has become a central area of interest that arose with the modern abstract development of algebraic geometry. Over finite fields, étale cohomology provides topological invariants associated to algebraic varieties. p-adic Hodge theory gives tools to examine when cohomological properties of varieties over the complex numbers extend to those over p-adic fields.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Carl Friedrich Gauss observed that non-zero integer solutions to homogeneous polynomial equations with rational coefficients exist if non-zero rational solutions exist.\n\nIn the 1850s, Leopold Kronecker formulated the Kronecker–Weber theorem, introduced the theory of divisors, and made numerous other connections between number theory and algebra. He then conjectured his \"liebster Jugendtraum\" (\"dearest dream of youth\"), a generalization that was later put forward by Hilbert in a modified form as his twelfth problem, which outlines a goal to have number theory operate only with rings that are quotients of polynomial rings over the integers.\n\nIn the late 1920s, André Weil demonstrated profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory with his doctoral work leading to the Mordell–Weil theorem which demonstrates that the set of rational points of an abelian variety is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nModern foundations of algebraic geometry were developed based on contemporary commutative algebra, including valuation theory and the theory of ideals by Oscar Zariski and others in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1949, André Weil posed the landmark Weil conjectures about the local zeta-functions of algebraic varieties over finite fields. These conjectures offered a framework between algebraic geometry and number theory that propelled Alexander Grothendieck to recast the foundations making use of sheaf theory (together with Jean-Pierre Serre), and later scheme theory, in the 1950s and 1960s. Bernard Dwork proved one of the four Weil conjectures (rationality of the local zeta function) in 1960. Grothendieck developed étale cohomology theory to prove two of the Weil conjectures (together with Michael Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier) by 1965. The last of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) would be finally proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1957, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura posed the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (now known as the modularity theorem) relating elliptic curves to modular forms. This connection would ultimately lead to the first proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory through algebraic geometry techniques of modularity lifting developed by Andrew Wiles in 1995.\n\nIn the 1960s, Goro Shimura introduced Shimura varieties as generalizations of modular curves. Since the 1979, Shimura varieties have played a crucial role in the Langlands program as a natural realm of examples for testing conjectures.\n\nIn papers in 1977 and 1978, Barry Mazur proved the torsion conjecture giving a complete list of the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the rational numbers. Mazur's first proof of this theorem depended upon a complete analysis of the rational points on certain modular curves. In 1996, the proof of the torsion conjecture was extended to all number fields by Loïc Merel.\n\nIn 1983, Gerd Faltings proved the Mordell conjecture, demonstrating that a curve of genus greater than 1 has only finitely many rational points (where the Mordell–Weil theorem only demonstrates finite generation of the set of rational points as opposed to finiteness).\n\nIn 2001, the proof of the local Langlands conjectures for GL was based on the geometry of certain Shimura varieties.\n\nIn the 2010s, Peter Scholze developed perfectoid spaces and new cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry over p-adic fields with application to Galois representations and certain cases of the weight-monodromy conjecture.\n\n"}

Halton Region encompasses the City of Burlington and the Towns of Oakville, Milton and Halton Hills. The Halton Regional Police Service has over 1050 employees which include 721 sworn police officers and approximately 350 civilian and volunteer members. The force is responsible for policing a population of approximately 540,000 people in an area covering 967 square kilometers.\n\nIn 2018, the Police Service employed 721 police officers. The chief of police is the highest-ranking officer of the Halton Regional Police Service. The position belongs to Stephen J.

The Chief reports to the seven person Halton Police Board which is independent from Regional or Municipal Council. \n\nThe Halton Regional Police Service was established in tandem with the creation of the Regional Municipality of Halton on January 1, 1974. It incorporated the former police services of Burlington, Oakville, Milton and Halton Hills and first consisted of 205 officers and 45 civilians. The Ontario Provincial Police continued to police the remainder of the region until 1975, when the regional force had expanded to the point where it could assume responsibility for the entire area.\n\nIn 2018, a new Deputy Chief of District Operations was announced, Roger Wilkie, and the new Halton Regional Police Service Headquarters (at Bronte Rd. and North Service Road W. in Oakville) was opened.

The steel girder bridge carries close to 22,000 cars a day. It connects Washington with affluent sections of Arlington and Fairfax counties in Virginia. On the Washington side, the bridge connects with Canal Road. Left turns onto the Clara Barton Parkway from the Chain Bridge are prohibited, but the reverse is permitted. On the Virginia side, the bridge connects with State Route 123 (Chain Bridge Road), which provides access to the George Washington Memorial Parkway.\n\nThe Chain Bridge has three lanes (of which the center is reversible) and can be safely accessed by pedestrians and cyclists. The pedestrian sidewalk provides access to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath via a ramp. The bridge also carries water mains which provides Arlington County with water from the Washington Aqueduct. \n\nThe first bridge at the location was opened on July 3, 1797. It was a wooden covered bridge, and rotted and collapsed in 1804. The second bridge, of similar type, burned six months after it was built.\n\nThe third bridge was built four years later in 1808, and its method of construction gave subsequent iterations their names. It was a chain suspension bridge, using 1¼ inch bars. It was designed by Judge James E. Finley, and was 136 feet long by 15 feet wide. It was destroyed by flood in 1810 or 1812. The fourth bridge was also a chain suspension bridge, and though damaged by floods in 1815, it lasted until 1840. The fifth bridge was built in 1840, and made of chain and wood. This span collapsed in 1852.\n\nIt was replaced by a crossbeam truss structure that resembled a long garden arbor or pergola, but retained its historical name. During the American Civil War, the Chain Bridge was a popular place for the Union Army to access the countryside encampments from Fairfax County. The bridge is the site of the first Union Army Balloon Corps balloon crossing, which took place overnight on October 12, 1861, conducted by Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe and a band of handlers who had to precariously traverse the outsides of the fully trellised bridge. In a nine-hour ordeal, the balloon \"Union\" was fully inflated in Washington and walked out to the battlefield at Lewinsville, Virginia.\n\nThe truss bridge was swept away in an 1870 flood, and a lightweight iron truss replacement was erected in 1872–1874. Traffic restrictions were placed on the bridge in the 1920s, and it was fully closed following the record flood of 1936.\n\nThe eighth and present version of the bridge is a continuous steel girder structure, completed in 1938 on piers dating from the 1870s.\n\nIn 1982, the bridge was significantly overhauled. The overhaul widened the three 10-foot wide lanes with a 12 foot wide one and two 11 foot ones. It also replaced a set of stairs from the bridge to the C&O Trail with a ramp, removed the sidewalk on the downstream side, added a crash barrier between the sidewalk and roadway, replaced the old railing with a fence and replaced heavy concrete with a lighter type that allowed the bridge to hold more weight.\n\n"}

Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, hypothesized that the anal stage of childhood psychosexual development was marked by the predominance of anal eroticism.\n\nThe English sex manual \"The Joy of Sex\" talked about the erogenous sensitivity of the anus, and its role in sexual pleasure. Its author, Alex Comfort, stated that anal intercourse was part of many heterosexual as well as homosexual relationships (as indeed had Freud at the start of that century). Comfort also stressed the importance (in the French tradition) of postillionage or anal fingering prior to orgasm.\n\nIn 1973, the psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott spoke of \"the tremendous pleasure that belongs to the doing of a motion just exactly when the impulse comes...another little orgy that enriches the life of the infant\".\n\nFreud, in his 1908 article \"Character and Anal Erotism\" argued that, through reaction formations and sublimation, anal eroticism could turn in later life into character traits such as obstinacy, orderliness and meanness. The psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi extended his findings in 1974 to cover the sublimation of anal eroticism into aesthetic experiences such as painting and sculpture, as well as into an interest in money. In 1946, the psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel linked anal eroticism to feelings of disgust, to masochism, and to pornography.\n\nThe psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva would subsequently explore anal eroticism in connection with her concept of abjection.\n\n"}

{"id": "1973195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973195", "title": "Robert Dundas of Arniston, the Elder", "text": "Robert Dundas of Arniston, the Elder\n\nRobert Dundas of Arniston, the Elder, 2nd Lord Arniston (1685–1753) was a Scottish lawyer, and Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1722 to 1737. In 1728 he reintroduced into Scottish juries the possible verdicts of \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" as against \"proven\" or \"not proven\". He was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1748 to 1753..\n\nDundas was born on 9 December 1685.the second son of Robert Dundas, Lord Arniston, a judge of the court of session, and his wife Margaret Sinclair, daughter of Sir Robert Sinclair of Stevenson. The family's Edinburgh house was at the head of Old Fishmarket Close on the Royal Mile. The house was later destroyed in the Great Fire of Edinburgh.\n\nHe was educated at Utrecht in about 1700 and was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 26 July 1709, and became a profound lawyer through his Interest and talent. \n\nIn about 1717 Dundas was appointed Assessor to city of Edinburgh and was also appointed in 1717 Solicitor General for Scotland by the secretary of state, the Duke of Roxburghe, the head of the Squadrone. He found this an irksome position, and in 1718 applied to succeed Eliot of Minto on the bench, but the place was already given to Sir Walter Pringle. However, he was promoted in 1720 by the Duke of Roxburghe to be Lord Advocate, in succession to Sir David Dalrymple . On 9 December 1721 he became dean of the Faculty of Advocates. On 11 July 1721 he resigned the post of assessor to the city of Edinburgh and an acrimonious correspondence took place between him and the magistrates of Edinburgh. \n\nAt the 1722 British general election Dundas was returned as Member of Parliament for Edinburghshire. He was a major opponent of the malt-tax in 1724, after the Argyll party came into power with Robert Walpole. He was counsel for the Glasgow magistrates after they were charged with conniving at the riots against the tax. He became a key figure in agitation against the tax and also encouraged the Edinburgh brewers to resist. In the Commons, on 4 March 1726, he blamed the riots on the mismanagement of the Government and the military authorities. Later he put forward a proposal to allocate part of the malt tax to improvements in Scotland. In 1727 he proposed a counter-address against the malt tax instead of a loyal address of the court of session. \n\nAt the 1727 British general election Dundas was returned unopposed as MP for Edinburghshire and continued in opposition. He spoke against the Government in the Dunkirk debate on 12 February 1730 and also in 1730 promoted a bill to give the court of session the power of adjourning. After his return unopposed at the 1734 British general election, he was the chief adviser of the opposition formed of representative peers and members of parliament against the administration of Scotch affairs adopted by Lord Ilay. With Erskine of Grange, he joined with the opposition in an attack in both Houses on the methods which the Government had used in the recent election of Scottish representative peers. This opposition movement was, however, unsuccessful. On 5 May 1735 the Commons passed a bill drafted by Erskine and introduced by Dundas to prevent the wrongful imprisonment of persons coming to vote in elections, but the bill was thrown out by the House of Lords. On 10 June 1737, Dundas was appointed a judge of the court of session, in succession to Sir Walter Pringle of Newhall, and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. \n\nIn 1745, Dundas' son Robert dissuaded his father from retiring into private life, but it was believed, he would have retired in 1748 if his hopes of becoming lord president had been disappointed. After a vacancy of nine months, the ministry and independent Whigs, overrode the Duke of Argyll's opposition, and on 10 September 1748 Dundas succeeded Duncan Forbes of Culloden as lord president, and filled the office for the rest of his life. \n\nDundas dies at Abbey Hill, Edinburgh, on 26 August 1753. He was buried on 31 August in the family tomb at Borthwick.\n\nDunas's most famous case was his defence of James Carnegie of Finhaven in 1728 on his trial for the murder of Charles, earl of Strathmore, whom he killed in a drunken brawl by mistake for Lyon of Bridgeton. The original practice was to allow the jury to find the prisoner generally \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\"; about the time of Charles II this was altered to a finding upon the facts of \"proven\" or \"not proven\". In this case it was clear that Carnegie killed Strathmore. If the jury were to find the fact \"proven\", leaving the court to pronounce the legal effect of that finding, Carnegie was a dead man. Dundas forced the court to return to the older course, and the jury found Carnegie \"not guilty\", and this practice was adopted in subsequent cases.\n\nAs an advocate he was both eloquent and ingenious; in private life idle and convivial. Dundas's appearance was forbidding and his voice harsh; his portrait is preserved at Arniston, and is engraved in the \"Arniston Memoirs\".\n\nDundas married, twice. In 1712, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Robert Watson of Muirhouse, who, with four of his children, died in January 1734 of smallpox, and by her he had a son, Robert, afterwards lord president, and other children.\n\nOn 3 June 1734, he married Anne, daughter of Sir William Gordon, bart., of Invergordon, by whom he had five sons and a daughter. One of these sons, Henry, was Treasurer of the Navy and 1st Viscount Melville.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973203", "title": "Pierre van Hooijdonk", "text": "Pierre van Hooijdonk\n\nPierre van Hooijdonk (; born 29 November 1969) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a striker. He had spells with clubs across Europe where he was a prolific goal scorer. Van Hooijdonk was capped 46 times for the Dutch national team, for which he scored 14 goals and played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2000 and Euro 2004. Noted for his bending free kicks, he is regarded by some as one of the greatest free kick specialists of all time.\n\nVan Hooijdonk was born in Steenbergen. His Moroccan biological father left Van Hooijdonk's mother before his birth. He grew up in Welberg (), a small village nearby Steenbergen. While playing in one of SC Welberg's youth squads Van Hooijdonk became desirous of a footballing career. His favourite team was NAC Breda whose game he followed wholeheartedly. At the age of 11 years old he took part in a talent pool on the team's open day and so impressed the NAC scouts. He thus joined NAC where he played mainly as a right midfielder. When he was 14 he was cut from NAC's academy and he then went into amateur football. As so he then switched his position to be a striker only to rejoin NAC and thus ascend to the club's first team.\n\nAs RBC Roosendaal were in financial trouble they were obliged to having youth players feature within their senior teams. As such in the 1988–89 season Van Hooijdonk made his debut for RBC as a substitute. Whilst playing as a sub for the club he soon scored three goals. With the club's main striker suffering from an injury Van Hooijdonk played almost the majority of the season's second half, scoring a total of six goals in 32 matches. He signed his first professional contract with RBC soon thereafter. Van Hooijdonk made a greater impression in the following season within which he became a key player for the team, scoring 27 times in 37 matches. Several teams went on to show interest in him such as NAC Breda. Van Hooijdonk thus didn't hesitate in signing a contract with NAC, and so rejoined his boyhood club.\n\nNAC paid 400,000 guilders for the transfer of Van Hooijdonk. In returning to NAC, he was both positive in his outlook as well as determined to illustrate his quality. Van Hooijdonk succeeded at such as he went on to help the team win promotion to the Eredivisie in 1993. During his time at the club he got his first call up, in December 1994, to play for the Netherlands. During the rest of that season he set a scoring streak in 11 consecutive Eredivisie matches. Within the 1994–95 winter break, Celtic made a deal with NAC which saw Van Hooijdonk join up with the Scottish outfit at once. Altogether he scored a total of 81 goals in 115 appearances for NAC.\n\nVan Hooijdonk made his Celtic debut on 11 January 1995 in a league match against Hearts at Hampden Park. The striker made an instant impact for his new team by scoring a stunning opening goal. Hearts went on to equalise and so the game finished 1–1. Van Hooijdonk settled quickly at Celtic and he became an instant favourite with the fans. When Van Hooijdonk arrived at Celtic they had not won any trophies in six years. With Van Hooijdonk in tow Celtic won the Scottish Cup of that season with him being the only goalscorer in the final against Airdrie in May 1995.\n\nThe following 1995–96 season, saw Van Hooijdonk in outstanding form for Celtic. He scored 32 goals, including 26 in the League which saw him finish as top scorer. Of particular note was his prowess at scoring from free kicks. However, despite Van Hooijdonk's goals and the attractive football being played by manager Tommy Burns' side, Celtic still finished the season without any silverware.\n\nVan Hooijdonk's next season at Celtic, 1996–97, was an unhappy time for both the player and the club. A row with the Celtic chairman/owner, Fergus McCann, would rumble on and as a result he often ended up on the bench. The manager of the Dutch national team Guus Hiddink then told him he wouldn't be selected for such as long as he was not a regular at Celtic.\n\nHe eventually left Celtic over a wage dispute towards the end of the 1996–97 season, stating that the reputed £7,000 a week rise he was being offered might be \"good enough for the homeless\" to live on \"but not for an international striker.\" In total Van Hooijdonk scored 52 goals for Celtic in 84 appearances. He went on to join up with Nottingham Forest in a deal worth up to £4.5 million.\n\nVan Hooijdonk arrived as Forest were in deep relegation trouble, struggling to maintain their position in the Premier League. He made his debut for Forest in a 1–1 draw against Blackburn on 11 March 1997. It was hoped the arrival of van Hooijdonk would kick-start their survival, but he scored just one goal in his eight games for them that season. Although only one of those games was lost, the other seven were drawn and Forest were relegated. He immediately pledged his future to helping the club regain their status.\n\nThe following season was an unqualified success, both for him and Forest. Forest won the title and promotion in a competitive league (facing stiff opposition from Sunderland, Charlton and Middlesbrough), with van Hooijdonk scoring 34 goals and building up a good partnership with strike partner Kevin Campbell, who scored 23 times. He was a regular in the Dutch national squad, and was named in the Dutch squad for 1998 FIFA World Cup in France where he scored as a substitute in the match against South Korea.\n\nAfter the World Cup had finished he discovered that the promised strengthening to the Forest squad to enable them to cope back in the Premier League had not transpired, indeed that his strike partner Campbell (who had an ongoing back injury) had been sold to Trabzonspor for £2.5m. The club had also announced that Scot Gemmill was dropped from the first team for refusing to sign a new contract, and that club captain and terrace hero Colin Cooper was being allowed to leave to the team promoted alongside them as runners up, Middlesbrough. Van Hooijdonk asked for a transfer. The club's new owners refused. Van Hooijdonk announced that he had been told previously that he could leave the club at the end of the 1997–98 season if he so wished, that he felt betrayed by the club's owners who had failed to deliver on their promises to him regarding the strengthening of the team, and that he felt he could no longer play for his employers. Forest, desperate for a striker, refused to allow him to be transfer-listed again, so van Hooijdonk announced his intention to strike. He kept fit by training with his former club NAC Breda.\n\nBecause of his behaviour Van Hooijdonk received criticism both from fans and from his teammates, not least from team-mate Steve Stone and manager Dave Bassett. The club refused to listen to offers for him, as they needed a top striker and the stand-off lasted until early November when van Hooijdonk, realising that he had no choice, agreed to return. By this time the club was again in relegation trouble: bottom of the league without a win in nine games. He played sporadically between then and the end of the season. He scored 6 goals in his 19 starts in the Premier League, including his first goal in his third game back against Forest's fierce rivals Derby County, helping them to a draw. Infamously after this goal most of his team-mates refused to celebrate alongside him, instead going to Scot Gemmill, the man who crossed the ball to him. He also scored a last minute home equaliser against rivals Liverpool with a trademark free-kick that protected Forest's proud unbeaten home run against them that went back to 1984. Forest ended the 1998–99 Premier League season bottom and were relegated. In 2015, van Hooijdonk expressed regret at going on strike, saying that the situation \"could have been handled differently\".\n\nAt the end of the 1998/99 season he returned to the Netherlands with Vitesse Arnhem in a £3.5m move to continue his career after and did much to convince his critics of his goal-scoring abilities when he helped the Arnhem team to a UEFA Cup spot with 25 goals in one season. He also returned into the Dutch national team in this period.\n\nVan Hooijdonk then signed a three-year deal for Benfica in 2000 where he joined up with one of the former Celtic F.C. 'three amigos' Jorge Cadete. He eventually only played one season for them with 19 goals. At Benfica he faced the same structural problems as he faced at Nottingham Forest and the team used three different managers throughout the season. The new chairman at the club had no faith in Van Hooijdonk and he was set back into their second team. Benfica were planning on selling him to another foreign club, but all Van Hooijdonk wanted was to return to his home country. At the end of the 2000/01 season, he signed for his fourth Dutch club, Feyenoord.\n\nWhile at Feyenoord, he will always be remembered for his free kick abilities and his integral part in the UEFA Cup 2001–02 win. He scored two goals against Borussia Dortmund in the final at De Kuip and his performances helped Feyenoord beat Freiburg, Rangers, PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan in earlier rounds.\n\nNever one to settle down, van Hooijdonk joined Fenerbahçe SK at the beginning of the 2003–04 season where he featured in 52 games for the Turkish club and scored 32 goals (24 in his first season). He was nicknamed \"Aziz Pierre\" (means Saint Pierre in Turkish) by fans. He wore the number 17, the same number that he wore for the national team. He won the Süper Lig title in 2003–04 (first championship in his career) and again the following year in 2004–05 with Fenerbahçe.\n\nIn mid-2005, he signed again for his former club, NAC, playing 17 games, scoring 5 goals. During the winter transfer window of the 2005–06 season, he signed for another former club, Feyenoord, where he scored 8 goals in 37 appearances. On 17 October 2006, Van Hooijdonk announced his retirement at the end of the 2006–07 season. On 13 May 2007, he eventually played his final professional match after a draw with Feyenoord against FC Groningen in the play-offs, having played 550 games (335 goals) in the highest leagues in 18 seasons of professional football.\n\nVan Hooijdonk is the father of Sydney van Hooijdonk, who is also a professional footballer.\n\nIt was reported in May 2008 that van Hooijdonk had been a victim of fraud and had lost £2,000,000 to a scam, which involved him investing in a Chinese textile company which did not exist.\n\nCeltic\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nFeyenoord\n\nFenerbahçe\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

A functional design assures that each modular part of a device has only one responsibility and performs that responsibility with the minimum of side effects on other parts. Functionally designed modules tend to have low coupling.\n\nThe advantage for implementation is that if a software module has a single purpose, it will be simpler, and therefore easier and less expensive, to design and implement.\n\nSystems with functionally designed parts are easier to modify because each part does only what it claims to do.\n\nSince maintenance is more than 3/4 of a successful system's life, this feature is a crucial advantage. It also makes the system easier to understand and document, which simplifies training. The result is that the practical lifetime of a functional system is longer.\n\nIn a system of programs, a functional module will be easier to reuse because it is less likely to have side effects that appear in other parts of the system.\n\nThe standard way to assure functional design is to review the description of a module. If the description includes conjunctions such as \"and\" or \"or\", then the design has more than one responsibility, and is therefore likely to have side effects. The responsibilities need to be divided into several modules in order to achieve a functional design.\n\nEvery computer system has parts that cannot be functionally pure because they exist to distribute CPU cycles or other resources to different modules. For example, most systems have an \"initialization\" section that starts up the modules. Other well-known examples are the interrupt vector table and the main loop.\n\nSome functions inherently have mixed semantics. For example, a function \"move the car from the garage\" inherently has a side effect of changing the \"car position\". In some cases, the mixed semantics can extend over a large topological tree or graph of related concepts. In these unusual cases, functional design is not recommended by some authorities . Instead polymorphism, inheritance, or procedural methods may be preferred.\n\nRecently several software companies have introduced functional design as a concept to describe a Parametric feature based modeler for 3D modeling and simulation. In this context, they mean a parametric model of an object where the parameters are tied to real-world design criteria, such as an axle that will adjust its diameter based on the strength of the material and the amount of force being applied to it in the simulation. It is hoped that this will create efficiencies in the design process for mechanical and perhaps even architectural/structural assemblies by integrating the results of finite element analysis directly to the behavior of individual objects.\n\n"}

He served as Solicitor General for Scotland from 1742 to 1746, as Lord Advocate from 1754 to 1760, and as Member of Parliament for Midlothian from 1754 to 1761. He was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1760 to 1787, losing his popularity for giving his casting vote against Archibald Douglas in the famous Douglas Cause.\n\nRobert Dundas was the eldest son of Robert Dundas of Arniston (1685–1753), Lord President of the Court of Session, by Elizabeth Watson, his first wife. He was educated first at home and at school, and then at the University of Edinburgh. In 1733, he proceeded to Utrecht University, then celebrated for the teaching of Roman law, and also visited Paris.\n\nReturning to Scotland in 1737, Dundas was admitted an advocate in 1738. He was quick, ingenious and eloquent, and had a retentive memory. Like his father, he was convivial and shirked drudgery. He is said, though a good scholar, never to have read through a book after leaving college. Being solely ambitious of attaining to the bench, he refused many cases, especially those which involved writing papers, and took only such work as seemed to lead to advancement. For his first five years, his fees only averaged £280 per annum. Through the favour of the Carteret administration, he was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland on 11 August 1742, and, no change occurring in the Scotch department on Lord Wilmington's death, held that post through the arduous and responsible times of the Jacobite plots and the rising of 1745. Being, however, unable to act easily with Lord Milton, the lord justice clerk, he resigned in 1746 upon the change of ministry, but was at once elected dean of the faculty.\n\nOn 16 August 1754, Dundas was appointed Lord Advocate, having been returned for Midlothian unopposed on 25 April at the general election. While in parliament, he opposed the establishment of a militia in Scotland, and, as lord advocate, was largely occupied in settling the new conditions of the highlands, and in disposing of his great patronage so as to enhance the family influence. But one speech of his in parliament is recorded,\n\nDundas was appointed a commissioner of fisheries on 17 June 1755, and on the death of Robert Craigie, he became lord president of the court of session, 14 June 1760. He found upwards of two years' arrears of cases undecided, and having by great efforts disposed of them, he never allowed his case-list to fall into arrears again. He was the best lord president who had filled the office, short but weighty in his judgements, thorough in his grasp of the cases, indignant at chicane, a punctilious guardian of the dignity of the court, a chief who called forth all the faculties of his colleagues. Having, on 7 July 1767, given the casting vote against the claimant, Archibald Stewart, in the Douglas peerage case, he became very unpopular, and during the tumultuous rejoicings at Edinburgh, after the House of Lords had reversed that decision on 2 March 1769, the mob insulted him and attacked his house.

He won ten stages in the Tour de France. In six starts, Raas won the Amstel Gold Race five times. In his entire career he competed in 23 of the highly contested \"Monument\" Races and he finished on the podium in almost half of them: 3rd place six times, 2nd place zero times, and 1st place four times.\n\nRaas was a tactician and clever sprinter. He struggled on the long steep climbs but excelled on the short climbs characteristic of the northern classics.\n\nBorn in Heinkenszand, near Goes in Zeeland, Raas was the son of a farmer and one of 10 children. He showed no interest in cycling until leaving school at 16 when he acquired his first racing bike and started competing as a junior category, taking his first victory in Damme in Belgium on the 21 July 1969. Further success as an amateur, including stage wins in the Olympia Tour and the national championship, prompted Peter Post, the manager of , to offer Raas a contract for 1975\n\nThe 22-year-old had a good first season with two small victories and fourth in the Tour of Belgium. The following year (1976) saw him become national champion, but at the end of that year Raas parted company with , looking for more freedom to race.\nIn 1977 he rode for Frisol. Victories in Milan–San Remo and the Amstel Gold Race made Post rethink and Raas was back with for 1978. Raas became the influence behind the success of the team in the late seventies and early eighties. He was joint leader with Gerrie Knetemann, heading members such as Joop Zoetemelk, Ludo Peeters, Cees Priem and Henk Lubberding.\n\nHe played a major role in the victory of Zoetemelk in the 1980 Tour de France, as TI-Raleigh had one of the most dominant performances in all of TDF history not only containing Bernard Hinault, but also winning twelve stages, including seven in a row at one point.\n\nRaas’ highlights for the rest of his career included his 1979 world championship on home soil in Valkenburg, where he outsprinted German \"Didi\" Thurau in front of 200,000 spectators (even with the help from team-mates that push him during the climb, grabbing service vehicle, and the fall of Giovanni Battaglin caused by Thurau and Raas himself on the last 200m). He had four more victories in the Amstel Gold Race to give a record of five. Raas regarded the Amstel Gold as his favourite race: “The Gold Race was made for me, I had no ability as a climber, but the short and hard Limburg hills were made for me”, he said. He won Paris–Roubaix at his seventh attempt in 1982 thanks to work by his team, especially Peeters.\n\nRaas crashed in the 1984 Milan–San Remo, injuring his back and internal organs and was never the same, although he took a stage in the 1984 Tour de France. He found the training and recovery hard and retired on 28 May 1985 after a criterium at Hansweert the preceding day.\n\nRaas’ know-how made for a natural move into team management and he became sporting director of Kwantum team. Raas found sponsors when old ones pulled out and the team received backing from SuperConfex, Buckler, WordPerfect, Novell and finally Rabobank.\n\nRaas and his wife Anja suffered an armed raid on their house in March 1994 and Raas decided he could no longer spend long periods away from home. He changed from sporting director to manager when Rabobank became the main sponsor in 1995. He spent eight years in this capacity until the end of 2003, the sponsor indicating that insoluble differences prompted Raas' departure.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\nDNF = Did not finish— = Did not compete\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1973261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973261", "title": "Cullinet", "text": "Cullinet\n\nCullinet was a software company whose products included the database management system IDMS and the integrated software package Goldengate. In 1989, the company was bought by Computer Associates. Cullinet was headquartered at 400 Blue Hill Drive in Westwood, Massachusetts.\n\nThe company was started by John Cullinane and Larry English in 1968 as Cullinane Corporation. Their idea was to sell pre-packaged software to mainframe users, which was at that time a new concept in an era when enterprises only used internally developed applications or the software that came bundled with the hardware.\n\nRather than write its own products, Cullinane approached IT (information technology) departments (at that time called Data Processing departments) of major enterprises, particularly banks, to identify internally developed applications that he felt had potential to be productized and licensed to others. However, it proved difficult to sell these applications because most weren't generalized and supportable systems. As a result, the company decided to develop a source code management system, called PLUS, that competed with Pansophic's (PanDA) and UCC's products (UCC-1 tape management system, etc.). The first version of PLUS (which stood for Program Library Update System) required the use of magnetic tape devices, and was not competitive with the other, disk-based products. Although the company eventually responded with a disk-based version, called PLUS-DA (which stood for Direct Access, a common name for disks at the time) they did not become successful in this market.\n\nThe first breakthrough product was a report writer named Culprit, developed in-house by Gil Curtis and Anna Marie Thron, who had built the PHI payroll system. The product competed with Mark IV from Informatics, Inc., but was perceived as a late entry in the report writer category.\n\nThe company struggled with financial stability until it branded a variation of Culprit, EDP Auditor, which was nothing more than a second name for the same product with a collection of predefined reports, but more importantly, special services aimed at the new discipline of EDP (electronic data processing) Auditing including the first EDP Auditors User, special support to give auditors independence of data processing which was very important to them. What was remarkable is that many corporations licensed essentially identical products. This led to serendipitous prosperity for Cullinane. As EDP auditors developed knowledge about business systems and computers, they could invariably produce reports faster than slower-moving, internal IT departments. As a result, MIS (management information systems) departments would feel compelled to buy the Culprit version for their own use — to compete.\n\nAs the company prospered in the early 1970s, it was approached by a consultant to BFGoodrich, Naomi O. Seligman, to consider taking over development of a Honeywell database management system called Integrated Data Store (IDS) that had been modified to operate on IBM and IBM compatible (RCA) mainframes. \nIDS was originally developed by General Electric, and Bill Curtis had supposedly gotten the rights to convert the system to run on IBM equipment. The decision was made in early 1973 — primarily by John Cullinane, Jim Baker and Tom Muerer — to bet the company on the effort. Several executives joined the effort over the next three years, including Andrew Filipowski, Robert Goldman, Jon Nackerud, Ron McKinney, William Casey, Bob Davis, Bill Linn, and Ray Nawara. IDMS was to be a great bet for the company as it became the leader among many capable and popular products of the mainframe era. It competed with Cincom's Total, Software AG's ADABAS, Applied Data Research's DATACOM/DB, Computer Corporation of America's Model 204, MRI (later Intel's) System 2000 and IBM Information Management System (IMS) and DL/I. In 1976, the source code was sold to International Computers Limited (ICL), whose developers ported the software to run on their 2900 Series mainframes, and subsequently also on the older 1900 machines. ICL continued development of the software independently of Cullinane, selling the originally ported product under the name IDMS and an enhanced version as IDMSX. In this form, it was used by many large UK and international users — examples being the Pay-As-You-Earn system operated by Inland Revenue and a system for Barclays Bank in South Africa. Many of these systems are still running in 2010 on Fujitsu equipment.\n\nJohn Cullinane mentored a series of future entrepreneurs and software industry executives. One of the early executives was Andrew 'Flip' Filipowski, who later founded Platinum Technology, Inc.. Another was Robert Goldman who became the CEO of several public software companies including AICorp. Jon Nackerud was a co-founder of Relational Technology, Inc., formed to commercialize the Ingres database management system. Prior to becoming a public company in 1978, the company's name was changed to \"Cullinane Database Systems, Inc.\" The company changed its name again to \"Cullinet Software\" in 1983, partly because John Cullinane wanted to distance his name from the personal connection to the business when he turned the company over to Bob Goldman, and also in a nod to the importance of computer networking (as evidenced by the company's simultaneous acquisition of Computer Pictures, whose microcomputer-based desktop system linked to IDMS data). Joe McNay, a board member, was particularly important regarding the company's IPO, the first ever in the software products industry. Greylock purchased some shares from John Cullinane in 1977, less than a year before the company was to go public. It was to be the early foundation on which their Greylock's software technology investment prowess rested. It was Greylock’s first investment in a software company.\n\nCullinane's public offering was of note as it was the first successful offering of a pure software products company ever and the first software company Hambrecht & Quist ever took public. Cullinet was also the first software company to have a billion dollar valuation, and the first to do a Super Bowl advertisement. Cullinane Database Systems, Inc., went public in 1978. On April 27, 1982 the company became the first computer software firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and later, the first to become a component stock of the S&P 500 Index. However, two quarters after the company went public IBM introduced its 4300 series. Its salesmen told all mutual clients that IDMS didn't run on the 4300 series and that all IBM software of the future would be built with IMS/DL1. This caused a major problem as every IDMS customer went ballistic and every prospect went on hold. The company only had three months to solve this marketing problem and technical problem, and remarkably, they did. Technically, it only required the modification of one instruction to get IDMS running on a 4300. The solution to the company's revenue problem turned out to be its new Integrated Data Dictionary. By moving very fast, the company used it to put IBM on the defensive and made its numbers, no small accomplishment. It then went from winning one out five competitions to winning four out five and this fueled its growth.\n\nBeginning in 1979, in an attempt to promote less dependence on the database sales alone, Cullinane fully integrated financial and manufacturing applications with IDMS and decision support systems, another first. The company acquired financial applications from McCormack & Dodge (\"M&D\"), a financial software company (acquired by Dun & Bradstreet later in 1983) and completely rewrote them using IDMS. They also acquired an MRP system from Rath & Strong and completely rewrote it using IDMS. Thus, Cullinet had a suite of integrated financial and manufacturing systems (called CIMS Cullinet Integrated Manufacturing System), the first on-line database driven applications, and was a major competitor in what is now called ERP. The company had become a software powerhouse. Eventually, it acquired a small Boston-based company called Computer Pictures whose graphics-focused decision support system TrendSpotter had already been integrated with IDMS and was very successful. This team developed \"Goldengate\", a Lotus Symphony-like PC product.\n\nGoldengate was a part of Cullinet's flawed ICMS (Information Center Management System). The promise of ICMS was the ability to move data between the mainframe and PC desktop. Apple Computer was supposed to do the same for the Apple Lisa, but never delivered. ICMS was unveiled in 1983 as part of a splashy 20+ city closed circuit TV broadcast that focused on IDMS/R and fueled the market for Cullinet for the next two years, but it was obvious that it was getting harder to maintain its unbroken string of quarters with sales and earnings in excess of 50%.\n\nThe company should have developed PC based IDMS development tools, instead. Ironically, it had the technology under development which was later to become the foundation of PowerBuilder at Powersoft. In fairness, many failures mark the landscape in that space and era including the Ovation product introduced with great fanfare by Ovation Corporation in a race with Lotus's Symphony suite attempting to create the early office suites dominated by Microsoft Corp.\n\nGoldengate's other flaw was that it was built pre-Windows, which was expensive for Cullinet because of all the permutations and combinations of PC hardware and memory configurations.\n\nIn 1983 John Cullinane, after 25 years in the software business, handed over the helm of Cullinet to Bob Goldman while he began to pursue other interests. Things continued to go well, but eventually the company ran into trouble and Cullinane brought in a recent acquaintance, David Chapman, as CEO of the company. At the time, Cullinet had $50 million in cash reserves. David Chapman, a veteran IBM and Data General executive, started an aggressive campaign to acquire technology from other companies. The reason for bringing in Chapman was that the company had gotten hung up on the open architecture and relational issues. In other words, a company with an unparalleled record of outpositioning competition every two years, for sixteen years, including IBM, allowed itself to get outpositioned by IBM and others, with the help of E.F. Codd and C.J. Date.\n\nIn 1986-87, Chapman attempted to move the company to the more and more powerful minicomputers such as Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line of computers. In the process, Cullinet acquired some very questionable VAX companies, but one had an outstanding relational DBMS. By then it was too late — the company's $50 million of cash had been spent.\n\nIn 1988, John Cullinane returned to Cullinet, fired Chapman and tried to salvage the company. By repositioning the company's product line with a new product called Enterprise Generator, he solved the open architecture problem and the company was able to return to profitability by the fourth quarter, which made it possible to negotiate a deal with Charles Wang, head of Computer Associates.\n\nIn 1989, Wang bought the company for $330 million in stock. It was a good deal for investors, which was reflected in the fact that shares of CA increased in value at least tenfold during the 1990s. It was a good deal for John Cullinane, too.\n\nMuch later, CA Technologies (formerly CA, Inc. and Computer Associates International, Inc.) still marketed and supported the CA IDMS relational database system for IBM z/OS, z/VSE and z/VM, Fujitsu Siemens BS2000/OSD, Linux (CA IDMS Server), UNIX (CA IDMS Server) and Windows (CA IDMS Server).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1973308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973308", "title": "Brown-banded cockroach", "text": "Brown-banded cockroach\n\nThe brown-banded cockroach, \"Supella longipalpa\" is a small species of cockroach, measuring about 10 to 14 mm long and the most well-known in the genus \"Supella\". It is tan to light brown and has two light-colored bands across the wings and abdomen, they may sometimes appear to be broken or irregular but are quite noticeable. The bands may be partly obscured by the wings. The male has wings that cover the abdomen, while the female has wings that do not cover the abdomen completely. The male appears more slender than the female, the female appears wider.\n\nThe brown-banded cockroach has a fairly wide distribution, being found in the northeastern, southern, and midwest regions of the United States quite commonly. They are one of the most recent alien cockroaches to form breeding colonies in Britain and Ireland. They need less moisture than the German cockroach so they tend to be more broadly distributed in the home, such as in living rooms and bedrooms. They can often be found in homes and apartments, but are less common in restaurants. They tend not to be found in the daytime, since they avoid light.\n\nIn an experiment by Tsai and Chi they found that populations of brown-banded cockroaches would be expected to thrive in environments with a temperature between 25 and 33 °C.\n\nThe brown-banded cockroach eats a wide variety of items.\n\nIn an experiment by Cohen and colleagues they found that the larva of the brown-banded cockroach when given a choice will choose a casein:glucose ratio of 15.5:84.5. The larvae that ate only casein died early in the experiment, a few larvae that ate only glucose survived past the larval stage but did not make it to adulthood. A decline in consumption of carbohydrates was seen at the time of first and second moults.\n\nPrakash and colleagues explain that the brown-banded cockroach has five segmented maxillary palps and the most distal fifth segment has the largest segment with the most variety of sensilla. With the variety of shapes and sizes of the maxillary it is expected that they would have a variety of functions. In Prakash and colleagues experiment they observed that the curved edge of fifth segment that remained most ventral and probes the substratum with it during foraging. On the fifth segment parallel to the curved ventral edge on the medial surface is a longitudinal furrow that's densely lined with papillaform sensilla. The shaft of the papilla has a longitudinal slit near the distal tip, allowing dendrites of the sensillum to sense the external environment. These dendrites proceed in a wavy form through the shaft of the sensillum. The sensillum contains antennal glomeruli, suggesting that it has an olfactory role. Prakash and colleagues suggest that since the location of this sensilla is in the maxillary palp that this is a short-range olfactory detector for the micro-environment. The olfactory sensilla on the antenna and the double-walled sensilla on both palps probably serve as long-range odour sensors. The maxillary and labial palps show sexual dimorphism which suggests involvement in courtship. Females have more sensilla chaetica on both appendages than males whereas, males have more chemosensilla on the maxillary palps and taste sensilla on the labial palps.\n\nAccording to Schall and colleagues the site of sex pheromone production in the female \"Supella longipalpa\" is located on the fourth and fifth abdominal tergites. Cuticular pores occur on all tergites, but the density is highest on the lateral margins of the fourth and fifth tergites. Each pore is connected via a long duct to modified epidermal cells, suggesting that these structures are involved in pheromone production.\n\nThe brown-banded cockroach has been the model in many studies about sex pheromones. Cockroaches rely on pheromones for many reproductive behaviours, including bringing the sexes together for mating. Their sex pheromones can be divided into two categories: cuticular compounds that elicit sexual responses after the sexes contact and volatile compounds that act over a distance.\n\nThe female brown-banded cockroach emits a sex pheromone that attracts males. Charlton and colleagues isolated and identified the pheromone as 5-(2,4-dimethylheptanyl)-3-methyl-2\"H\"-pyran-2-one which they refer to as supellapyrone. A blend of synthetic compound elicited behavioural and electrophysiological responses comparable to the natural pheromone.\nThis sex pheromone can be synthesized by direct coupling of a brominated pryoned with an alkylzanic reagent. The stereochemistry of the natural pheromone was assigned by a combination of synthesis, chiral gas chromatography, and electrophysiological measurement.\nThey key step in synthesizing the three stereoisomers of this pheromone is employing lipase-catalyzed desymmetrization or enantiomer separation of syn- or anti-2,4-dimethylpentane-1,5-diol.\nSupellapyrone has four configurations but female brown-banded cockroaches can only produce the RR isomer. In an experiment by Gemono and colleagues they found that the males are attracted to the RR isomer but they are also highly attracted to the SR isomer. Males also responded to SS isomer but the RS isomer elicited little to no response from any males.\n\nThe regulation of the female sex pheromone production, calling behaviour and release is regulated directly and indirectly by the corpora allata and juvenile hormone. Smith and Schal came to this conclusion because both pheromone production and calling failed to occur after allatectomy; both pheromone production and calling could be restored by a corpora allata implantation or treatment with juvenile hormones; applications of a juvenile hormones to intact females advanced the age of pheromone production and NCA-I \"transection\", which activates the copora allata in other cockroaches, advanced the age of pheromone production and calling.\n\nOöcyte growth in the brown-banded cockroach correlated with corpora allata activity \"in vitro\". Ovariectomies were conducted: both pheromone production and calling were unaffected by either nymphs or adults, this was done to demonstrate that the ovaries do not mediate in the regulation of pheromone production. The role of juvenile hormone in pheromone production appears to be regulated by neural and humoral feedbacks.\n\nCalling ceases in an adult female after mating and does not resume throughout the duration of the insects life. Calling was suppressed and oöcyte growth was stimulated by the presence of a spermatophore, by the implantation of a spermatophore and by mating with vasectomized males. Odthecal deposition in females mated with vasectomized males caused calling to resume. Smith and Schal found that ventral nerve cord transections, either immediately following copulation or after odthecal deposition, restored calling in mated females. Their experimental evidence suggested that termination of calling is moderated neurally by a two-stage process, initiated by placement of the spermatophore and maintained by the presence of sperm in the spermatheca.\n\n"}

The\nmethod is often used in high-speed combusting flows because the high velocity and temperature\naccentuate its advantages over similar methods. HTV uses a laser (often an argon-fluoride\nexcimer laser operating at ~193 nm) to dissociate the water in the flow into H + OH. Before entering the flow optics are\nused to create a grid of laser beams. The water in the flow is dissociated only where beams of\nsufficient energy pass through the flow, thus creating a grid in the flow where the\nconcentrations of hydroxyl (OH) are higher than in the surrounding flow. Another laser beam (at either ~248 nm or ~308 nm) in\nthe form of a sheet is also passed through the flow in the same plane as the grid. This laser\nbeam is tuned to a wavelength that causes the hydroxyl molecules to fluoresce in the UV spectrum. The fluorescence is then captured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Using\nelectronic timing methods the picture of the grid can be captured at nearly the same instant\nthat the grid is created.\n\nBy delaying the pulse of the fluorescence laser and the camera shot, an image of the grid that\nhas now displaced downstream can be captured. Computer programs are then used to compare the\ntwo images and determine the displacement of the grid. By dividing the displacement by the known\ntime delay the two dimensional velocity field (in the plane of the grid) can be determined.\n\nOther molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) methods have used ozone (O), excited oxygen and nitric oxide as the tag instead of hydroxyl. In the case of ozone the method is known as ozone tagging velocimetry or OTV. OTV has been developed and tested in many room air temperature applications with very accurate test results. OTV consists of an initial \"write\" step, where a 193-nm pulsed excimer laser creates ozone grid lines via oxygen (O) UV absorption, and a subsequent \"read\" step, where a 248-nm excimer laser photodissociates the formed O and fluoresces the vibrationally excited O product thus revealing the grid lines' displacement.\n\n"}
{"id": "1973314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973314", "title": "Aquifex aeolicus", "text": "Aquifex aeolicus\n\nAquifex aeolicus,is a chemoautotrophic, Gram-negative, motile, generally rod-shaped bacterium with an approximate length of 2.0-6.0μm and a diameter of 0.4-0.5μm. \"\"A.aeolicus\"\" is neither validly nor effectively published and, having nob standing in nomenclature, should be styled in quotation marks. It is one of a handful of species in the Aquificae Phylum, an unusual group of thermophilic bacteria that are thought to be some of the oldest species of bacteria,related to filamentous bacteria first observed at the turn of the century. \"A. aeolicus\" grows best in water between 85°C and 95°C, and can be found near underwater volcanoes or hot springs. It requires oxygen to survive but has been found to grow optimally under microaerophilic conditions. Due to its high stability against high temperature and lack of oxygen, \"A.aeolicus\" is a good candidate for biotechnological applications as it is believed to have potential to be used as hydrogenases in an attractive H2/O2 biofuel cell, replacing chemical catalysts. This can be useful for improving industrial processes.\n\nMorphology\n\nMature \"A.aeolicus\" cells are typically rod-shaped bacterium with an approximate length of 2.0-6.0μm and a diameter of 0.4-0.5μm . These cells are motile by means of a monopolar polytrichous flagella. Additionally, members of the species tend to form large cell conglomerations, of up to 100 individual cells.\n\nMetabolism\n\nAsanautotroph, \"A.aeolicus\" has the ability to obtain all necessary carbon by fixing CO2 from the environment. Additionally, this bacterium utilizes the TCA cycle as it provides the substrates of many bio synthetic pathways. The \"A.aeolicus\" genome contains encoding genes that together could constituent the TCA pathway: fumarate reductase, fumarate hydratase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, ferredoxin oxidoreductase, succinate-CoA ligase, aconitase and citratesynthase. Moreover, this bacterium uses oxygen, hydrogen, and mineral salts as its primary energy sources.\n\nRegarding its growth under microaerophilic conditions, Aquifex species have been observed to grow in oxygen concentrations as long as 7.5ppm. It is hypothesized that this is possible because 1) their oxygen-respiration system was already highly developed before the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, 2) the Aquifex lineage came to life after there was a rise in atmospheric oxygen, or 3) oxygen respiration was developed, and then transferred among different bacterial lineages, such as Aquifex.\n\n\"A.aeolicus\" was first discovered in the outflow of hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. However, it was also found growing near underwater volcanoes around the Aeolian Islands, north of Sicily. Asathermophilic, \"A.aeolicus\" grows best in water between 85°C and 95°C , with a pH optima of 8.0, ranging from 6.8-9.0.\n\nComparison of the \"Aquifex aeolicus\" genome to other organisms showed that around 16% of its genes originated from the Archaea domain. It is most closely related to the hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium, \"Aquifex pyrophilus\", and its close relative, \"Hydrogenobacter thermophilus\".\n\nThe genome of \"A.aeolicus\" has been successfully mapped, but was noted to be only one-third the size of the \"E. coli\" genome. As a result of the limited genome size, metabolic flexibility seemed to reduce. It has the smallest genome of any known non-parasite. Its total genome is 1.5 Mb long, has a G+C content of 43.4%, and contains 1512 genes. It also contains genes potentially coding for three distinct [NiFe] hydrogenases, however, it is thought that the Aquifex hydrogenases I and II function in energy conservation, where as hydrogenase III is more likely required for CO2 fixation. Additionally, during sequencing, a single extra chromosomal element (ECE) was identified, suggesting evidence of genetic exchange between the \"A. aeolicus\" chromosome and the ECE.\n\n"}

{"id": "1973321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973321", "title": "1999 Australian Open", "text": "1999 Australian Open\n\nThe 1999 Australian Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia. It was the 87th edition of the Australian Open and was held from 18 through 31 January 1999. This was the first Grand Slam of the calendar year. Total attendance for the event reached 391,504. \n\nIn the singles competition, Petr Korda and Martina Hingis were the defending champions. Korda was unseeded at this tournament and was eliminated in the third round by American 15th seed Todd Martin. This loss resulted in him falling down the rankings from 20th to 76th. Later in July, Korda received a suspension from tennis by the ITF after testing positive for nandrolone at Wimbledon last year. Yevgeny Kafelnikov, on the other hand, ended up becoming the men's champion, defeating surprise finalist Swede Thomas Enqvist in four sets. With this win, Kafelnikov became the first Russian, male or female, to win an Australian Open title. In the women's singles, two-time defending champion Martina Hingis successfully defended her title, defeating another surprise finalist in Frenchwoman Amélie Mauresmo. This win allowed Hingis to join Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles as the only women to have won three consecutive Australian Open titles. Amélie Mauresmo would later become the World No. 1 in 2004, and despite being one of the top players of the early to mid-2000s, this would be her only Grand Slam final until the 2006 Australian Open, which she won.\n\nIn doubles, the defending champions were Jonas Björkman and Jacco Eltingh for the men's, Martina Hingis and Mirjana Lučić for the women's, and Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob for the mixed. Eltingh did not participate at this year's Australian Open, leaving Björkman to team up with Australia's Patrick Rafter. Rafter and Björkman later won the title, defeating the Indian first seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in five sets. Hingis and Lučić also separated, with Hingis teaming up with Anna Kournikova and Lučić teaming up with Mary Pierce. Lučić and Pierce fell in the first round, but Hingis and Kournikova went on to win, by defeating first seeds Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva at the final. The mixed doubles competition saw Williams and Gimelstob not competing, and none of the seeds reaching past the second round. In the end, the South African team of Mariaan de Swardt and David Adams won, defeating Williams' sister Serena and her partner Max Mirnyi in the final.\n\nThe Juniors Competition saw the first ever junior double, with Kristian Pless and Virginie Razzano both winning their respective singles and doubles titles. Pless defeated Mikhail Youzhny in the singles before teaming up with Jürgen Melzer to defeat the Czech team of Ladislav Chramosta and Michal Navrátil in the doubles. Razzano defeated Katarína Bašternáková in the singles final and teamed up Eleni Daniilidou to defeat South Africans Natalie Grandin and Nicole Rencken in straight sets. The last time a boy won both the singles and doubles title at a Grand Slam was Roger Federer at the previous year's Wimbledon, while the last girl was Cara Black at the Wimbledon the year before. Julien Jeanpierre and Mirjana Lučić were the last players to win Australian Open Junior singles and doubles titles in the same year; in 1998 and 1997 respectively.\n\n\nThere were five competitions open to professional tennis players. The Association of Tennis Professionals and Women's Tennis Association awarded ranking points in all events apart from the mixed doubles. The singles draws were contested by one hundred and twenty eight players, while sixty four teams partook in the doubles events, and thirty two teams lined up in the mixed doubles competition.\n\nWith World No. 1 Pete Sampras absent, along with World No. 2 and last year's finalist Marcelo Ríos, the No. 1 spot was thought to be up for grabs coming into this year's Australian Open.<ref name=\"ATP Rankings For 2/1/1999\"></ref> Andre Agassi was considered the favourite, having won the 1995 Australian Open and having what was thought to be an easy path to the semifinals, Carlos Moyà being the only player considered to be a threat to him. Patrick Rafter was also considered a favourite, despite having in-form players Thomas Enqvist and Mark Philippoussis in his path. Àlex Corretja was another possibility to claim the No. 1 spot, being the World No. 3 and only a third round appearance to defend.\n\nWith Ríos' withdrawal, Àlex Corretja was the top seed at No. 2, with US Open champion Patrick Rafter, French Open champion Carlos Moyá and Andre Agassi following. Tim Henman, last year's semifinalist Karol Kučera, Greg Rusedski, Richard Krajicek and Yevgeny Kafelnikov made up the rest of the Top 10 seeds. Despite being the defending champion, Petr Korda was not seeded as he was outside the Top 17.\n\nThe first round saw the first upset of the tournament, with Moyá falling to World No. 37 Nicolas Kiefer in four sets. 12th seed Albert Costa, 13th seed Cédric Pioline and 16th seed Thomas Johansson also fell in the first round. Corretja, 15th seed Todd Martin and Korda all survived five set encounters. The second round saw the end of Corretja's No. 1 dreams as went down in four sets to World No. 86 Christian Ruud. Rusedski was also the victim of an upset, falling to qualifier Paul Goldstein also in four sets. The third round saw further upsets, as Rafter fell in four sets to Enqvist, Henman went down to Swiss Marc Rosset in three, and Krajicek went down to Wayne Ferreira in five. The third round also saw the end of Korda, falling to Martin in five sets; and Kafelnikov survive an encounter with 1992 and 1993 champion Jim Courier, Courier having retired in the fourth set.\n\nThe fourth round saw Martin, Kafelnikov and Kučera being the only seeds to progress to the quarterfinals. 14th seed Mark Philippoussis fell to Enqvist, and Agassi was defeated by World No. 44 Vincent Spadea in four sets. Unseeded players Tommy Haas, Nicolás Lapentti and Marc Rosset also progressed. The quarterfinals saw the end of Martin, being defeated by Kafelnikov in three sets. It also saw Haas defeating Spadea, and Enqvist continuing his good form against Rosset. The quarterfinals also witnessed the end of Kučera, being defeated in a five-set contest against Lapentti. This meant that Sampras would not be forfeiting his No. 1 ranking as previously predicted.\n\nThe semifinals saw the final seed in the draw, Kafelnikov, progressing past Haas in three sets to reach his first Grand Slam final since 1996. His opponent was Enqvist, who also passed to the final in three sets, defeating Lapentti. The final saw Enqvist win the first set, before Kafelnikov came back to take the next three. Kafelnikov's ranking rose to No. 3 following this tournament, and he became the first Russian tennis player to win the Australian Open.\n\nChampionship match result\n\nThe seeds of the 1999 Australian Open were led by the previous year's Grand Slam champions. US Open champion Lindsay Davenport was the first seed, Australian Open champion Martina Hingis came second, Wimbledon champion Jana Novotná was third and French Open champion Arantxa Sánchez Vicario was fourth. Following behind came Venus Williams, four-time Australian Open champion Monica Seles, 1995 Australian Open champion Mary Pierce, Patty Schnyder, last year's Australian Open finalist Conchita Martínez, and four-time Australian Open winner Steffi Graf. Dominique Van Roost, Anna Kournikova, Irina Spîrlea, Sandrine Testud, Natasha Zvereva and Amanda Coetzer were also seeded.\n\nThe first round of the women's singles saw every seed go through except for 13th seed Irina Spîrlea, who lost to former finalist and last year's semifinalist Anke Huber, 7–5, 6–4. There was a scare, however, for 5th seed Venus Williams, who dropped the first set to World No. 82 Croatian Silvija Talaja, 3–6, and was struggling through the third; at one point being two points away from defeat. However, in the end, she managed to survive, winning, 3–6, 6–3, 9–7. The second round was the setting for the first major upset of the tournament when 4th seed and two-time finalist Arantxa Sánchez Vicario fell easily to the World No. 24 Barbara Schett, 6–2, 6–2. 8th seed Patty Schnyder also fell in the second round to teenage Frenchwoman and World No. 29, Amélie Mauresmo, 6–7, 6–4, 6–3.\n\nThe third round saw 15th seed Natasha Zvereva fall to Chanda Rubin in three sets, last year's finalist and 9th seed Conchita Martínez go down in three sets to Émilie Loit in what was Loit's first Top 10 victory, and another major upset when 3rd seed Jana Novotná lost to Spaniard María Sánchez Lorenzo, 6–3, 6–0. 14th seed Sandrine Testud was almost the victim of another upset, but she saved two match points against her opponent Serena Williams and defeated her, 6–2, 2–6, 9–7. The third round also saw the end of home dreams, when Aussies Nicole Pratt and Jelena Dokić both fell to Amélie Mauresmo and Martina Hingis respectively. The fourth round saw an easy progression for the World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport over the last qualifier remaining, Canadian Maureen Drake. Fellow Americans Venus Williams and Monica Seles also had easy wins; as did Steffi Graf, Mary Pierce and Dominique Van Roost. Defending champion Martina Hingis lost the second set to Amanda Coetzer, but came back to easily take the third, 6–1. The final spot in the quarterfinals was decided by an all-French match between Émilie Loit and Amélie Mauresmo. Mauresmo won the first set without losing a game, and then went on to win the second set, 7–5, despite a valiant effort from Loit.\n\nThe quarterfinals saw Davenport easily defeat Williams, Hingis breeze through Pierce, and Seles coming back from 4–5 down in the first set to defeat Graf, 7–5, 6–1, which would be the last match in their rivalry which Seles won; and her only post-stabbing victory over Graf. Surprise quarterfinalist Mauresmo continued her momentum, causing another upset by defeating Van Roost in two sets. In the semifinals, Mauresmo went on to cause the biggest upset of the tournament, by defeating the World No. 1 Davenport in three sets, 4–6, 7–5, 7–5, despite Davenport leading 4–2 in the third set. On the other side, Martina Hingis reached her third consecutive Australian Open final, having defeating Monica Seles, 6–2, 6–4, and restricting Seles' Open Era record for an Australian Open winning streak made by a woman to 33. In the final, Hingis defeated Mauresmo in straight sets, 6–2, 6–3. With this win, Hingis joined Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles as the only women to have won three consecutive Australian Open titles.\nChampionship match result\n\nLast year's double star and defending champion Jacco Eltingh retired at the end of the previous year, so his former partner Jonas Björkman teamed up with countryman Patrick Rafter as the fifth seed.\n\nThe other top seeds were \"Indian Express\" (Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes) at No. 1, the \"Woodies\" (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) at No. 2, Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor at No. 3, and Ellis Ferreira and Rick Leach at No. 4. Former Eltingh partner Paul Haarhuis teamed up with Patrick Galbraith to make the sixth seeded team. Frenchmen Olivier Delaître and Fabrice Santoro were No. 7; and Sébastien Lareau and Alex O'Brien came at No. 8.\n\nThe first round saw half of the No. 9 to No. 16 seeds fall; and Lareau and O'Brien joining them. Knowles and Nestor fell in the second round, and Delaître and Santoro went out in the third round. Apart from those casualties, however, all of the Top 8 made the quarterfinals. Also in the quarterfinals were Americans Richey Reneberg and Jonathan Stark, Gustavo Kuerten and Nicolás Lapentti; and tenth seeds Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Daniel Vacek.\n\nKuerten and Lapentti withdrew from the quarterfinals due to Lapentti's unexpected run to the semifinals of the singles competition. As such, Björkman and Rafter (who would've been their opponents) got an effective bye to the semifinals of the doubles. First seeds Bhupathi and Paes joined them, after triumphing over Reneberg and Stark; second seeds Woodbridge and Woodforde followed, defeating Kafelnikov and Vacek; and fourth seeds Ferreira and Leach also went through, defeating Galbraith and Haarhuis.\n\nBhupathi and Paes easily defeated Ferreira and Leach, 7–6, 6–3, 7–6 to end up in the final, where they were joined by Björkman and Rafter; who came back from two sets down to defeat the Woodies, 3–6, 4–6, 6–2, 6–2, 8–6. The final of the men's doubles ended up also going to five sets after Bhupathi and Paes won a very close tiebreaker in the fourth (12–10). However, Björkman and Rafter took out the fifth set 6–4 to claim Björkman's second and Rafter's only Grand Slam doubles title.\n\nChampionship match result\n\nWith none of the teams present having won a Grand Slam doubles title together, the competition was wide open. Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva were the first seeds, having lost in the finals of all the Grand Slams last year. Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs followed them as the second seed, while last year's doubles star and defending champion Martina Hingis and her new doubles partner Anna Kournikova were the third seed. Veterans Larisa Neiland and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario teamed up to make the fourth seed, while Elena Likhovtseva and Ai Sugiyama came in at No. 5. Conchita Martínez and Patricia Tarabini; Mariaan de Swardt and Elena Tatarkova; and Irina Spîrlea and Caroline Vis were the rest of the top eight seeds. Hingis' former doubles partner and fellow defending champion Mirjana Lučić teamed up with Mary Pierce as the sixteenth seed.\n\nThe first round saw one major casualty in Martínez and Tarabini, who fell to wildcards Jelena Dokić and Åsa Carlsson. The first round also saw a quick end to Lučić and Pierce, who fell in straight sets to Christina Singer and Helena Vildová. The second round saw the fall of Likhovtseva and Sugiyama, and Spîrlea and Vis. The only major casualty of the third round was de Swardt and Tatarkova.\n\nAll the top three seeds made it to the semifinals, and they were joined by the up-and-coming Williams sisters, who defeated Neiland and Sánchez Vicario en route. Davenport and Zvereva defeated the Williams sisters to reach the final, in what is their fifth consecutive Grand Slam final; and Davenport's fourth consecutive Australian Open final in doubles. They were joined by Hingis and Kournikova, in what is also Hingis' fifth consecutive Grand Slam doubles final and Kournikova's first. Hingis and Kournikova triumphed in straight sets, 7–5, 6–3, to make Hingis' fifth doubles Grand Slam win and the fifth doubles Grand Slam defeat of Davenport and Zvereva.\n\nChampionship match result\n\nThe seeds for the mixed doubles title were led by 1991 French Open finalists Caroline Vis and Paul Haarhuis. Anna Kournikova and Mark Knowles came second, while Rennae Stubbs and Jim Grabb and Mirjana Lučić and Mahesh Bhupathi followed.\n\nIn a massive surprise, all of the top three seeds fell in the first round, with No. 6 seeds Katrina Adams and Leander Paes and No. 8 seeds Lisa Raymond and Patrick Galbraith following. The second round saw no seeds progressing to the quarterfinals. Lučić and Bhupathi fell to Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson; No. 5 seeds Larisa Neiland and Rick Leach went down to Debbie Graham and Ellis Ferreira; while No. 7 seeds Elena Tatarkova and Cyril Suk were defeated by Mariaan de Swardt and David Adams.\n\nThe semifinals had Manon Bollegraf and Pablo Albano, who defeated Vis and Haarhuis earlier, draw against wildcards Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi, who defeated Stubbs and Grabb. The other side had Graham and Ferreira drawn against de Swardt and Adams.

The inaugural race was held in 2005 and the final race was held in 2008. The 2005 race marked the first time that NASCAR had run a Busch Series race on a road course since 2001, and at one time the Mexico City race was one of three road races on the Busch/Nationwide circuit (joining races at Watkins Glen and Montreal).\n\nMuch attention was directed towards this race, as it was the first NASCAR points-paying race outside the United States since 1952. The only recent international races for NASCAR had been those at the Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi (1996–1998) in Japan, but the races were non-points-paying exhibition races. In 1952, NASCAR sanctioned points-paying races on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.\n\nThe Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez track is a very popular track for open-wheel racing such as Formula One and Champ Car, however the course needed some work to make it suitable for stock cars. The most notable difference was a chicane on the pit straight, and also the addition of a link to eliminate Curva Héctor Rebaque, instead adding a long, curve between the track's short circuit curve and Ese del Lago. This move was made because of the heavy braking of the heavier cars. Unlike the Champ Car race, however, the cars do not use the chicane at Peraltada. In 2007 the cars no longer used the frontstretch \"Bus stop chicane\".\n\nTickets sales were good, and fans packed the track after the announcement that several local drivers would drive NASCAR entries normally driven by other drivers. Among them was open-wheel star Adrián Fernández, Jorge Goeters, Mara Reyes (a female driver), Carlos Contreras, and Michel Jourdain Jr. who had just moved to NASCAR from Champ Car.\n\nJorge Goeters won the pole position for the event, with a lap average speed of 103.366 mph. Goeters led the NASCAR field for the first twenty-four laps, but Martin Truex Jr., then moved into the lead for several laps. The home crowd roared loudly when he was displaced by Mexico native Adrián Fernández, who led for several laps before giving up the lead to Truex, who went on to win the race. Top Mexican native finisher was Fernández, who finished tenth. Pole winner Jorge Goeters finished thirty-eighth after engine failure. Reyes finished thirty-fifth, Contreras thirty-sixth, and Jourdain thirty-seventh.\n\nDenny Hamlin took his first Busch Series win with an impressive performance at the track. Road-course ringer Boris Said made another fine visit to take second place after providing Hamlin with his stiffest challenge. After his third top-five finish from six Busch starts, Said admitted: \"We just got beat. Denny Hamlin's the real deal.\"\n\nKyle Busch had looked like a victory contender but angered the home crowd, when he hit local driver Michel Jourdain Jr. following a rash move into turn eight. Jourdain was out on the spot, and Busch dropped down to seventh. Third place went to the points leader, Kevin Harvick, with J. J. Yeley in fourth and Paul Menard fifth. Post-race, Marc Goossens, who made his Busch series debut in the No. 90 Robert Yates car, was lauded for leading 2 laps during the event and coming home in the 9th position.\n\nJuan Pablo Montoya took his first Busch Series win. Defending race winner Denny Hamlin seemed to be the only one who could give the Colombia native a run for his money and settled for second.\n\nThe win was bittersweet for Montoya and his team, as with only 9 laps to go, Montoya's teammate, Scott Pruett driving the No. 41 Dodge, attempted to block Montoya, who had fresher tires. As the two drove into turn one, Pruett moved down low, and Montoya did not back off, spinning Pruett and forcing many drivers into the grass. Third went to road course ace Boris Said; in fourth was new points leader Carl Edwards (due to Kevin Harvick not being in the race), and Pruett would come back from the 17th position to round out the top five.\n\nThe collision with Pruett came at the climax of an impressive drive by Montoya. On his final scheduled pit stop at lap 44, a failure in the overflow valve in the refuelling system prevented his team from filling his fuel tank, requiring an additional stop on lap 54 to repair the problem and top off the fuel tank, with his returning to the track in 19th place. Montoya then took advantage of his having fresher tires than anyone else to move up to second place within fifteen laps, despite his advance being slowed by a number of full-course cautions, putting him in position to pass Pruett, leading to the incident mentioned above.\n\nPruett was not pleased with his teammate post-race, stating \"\"That was nasty dirty driving.\"\"\n\nIn the farewell running of the Mexico City race, the renamed Corona Mexico 200 was an action-filled race. Because of the unique layout of the course, road course ringers were prominent in the field, such as Scott Pruett, Boris Said, Patrick Carpentier, Adrian Fernandez, DJ Kennington, Michel Jourdain Jr., Chris Cook, and Kevin O'Connell.\n\nThe pole sitter was Colin Braun in Roush-Fenway Racing's #16 Ford. Starting second was road course ringer Scott Pruett. Pruett was looking to avenge his heartbreaking loss the previous season. The race saw a couple of the road course ringers in contention for the win. Pruett led the most laps and was the class of the whole field. He proceeded to lead 36 of the 80 laps, giving up the lead only during pit stop cycles and small green-flag runs. Australian second-year driver Marcos Ambrose was involved in a heated incident with Boris Said when he wrecked Said on a restart. Boris replied by pointing the finger at Ambrose during the resulting caution and vowing retaliation. Kyle Busch passed Pruett with 7 laps to go to win the race, while Ambrose finished 2nd.\n\n"}

It is located in the northeasternmost part of Norway, along the Barents Sea. The peninsula has the Tanafjorden to the west, the Varangerfjorden to the south, and the Barents Sea to the north and east. The municipalities of Vadsø, Båtsfjord, Berlevåg, Vardø, Tana, and Nesseby share the peninsula. Nesseby and Tana are only partially on the peninsula, with the rest being entirely on the peninsula.\n\nThe peninsula gave the name to the Varangian glaciation episode. A large part of this peninsula, including the town of Vardø (located on an island just off the coast of the peninsula), has an Arctic tundra climate. However, on the south coast, including the town of Vadsø, there is sufficient summer heat for birch trees to grow. The area has rugged mountain terrain with altitudes up to .\n\nThe Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management has a project on the peninsula for the reintroduction and protection of the Arctic fox, which is critically endangered on the Norwegian mainland. In addition to introducing animals into nature, the larger and stronger Red fox is hunted down.\n\nThere are many species of sea birds along the coast of the peninsula; some arctic species of birds spend the winters along the coast of the peninsula. The Varangerhalvøya National Park protects a majority of the land on the peninsula.\n\nMuch of the relief of Varanger Peninsula is a paleic surface similar to the one found in the highlands of southern Norway. In the peninsula the paleic surface is made up of an undulating plateau between the altitudes of 200 and 600 m.a.s.l.. The higher parts of the undulating plateau are made up by erosion-resistant rocks like quartzite. The lower parts are made up by weak rocks like shale and mudstone. At intermediate levels sandstone is common. Some parts of the paleic surface in Varanger Peninsula are a re-exposed unconformity that underlie sedimentary rock of Vendian (Late Neoproterozoic) age. The paleic surface might have been uplifted as much as 200-250 meters since middle Pliocene times.\n\nLandforms resulting from Quaternary periglaciation are recurrent across the peninsula. Among the most common are block fields and solifluction lobes. Blockfields are most extensive on the northern half of the peninsula, chiefly in the plateau area. Polygonal ground is found in some places, but there is no known modern ice wedges. Permafrost was as of 1985 only known from bogs, and in a few places this permafrost had originated thermokarst depressions.\n"}

The main goal of anti-replay is to avoid hackers injecting or making changes in packets that travel from a source to a destination. Anti-replay protocol uses a unidirectional security association in order to establish a secure connection between two nodes in the network. Once a secure connection is established, the anti-replay protocol uses packet sequence numbers to defeat replay attacks as follows: When the source sends a message, it adds a sequence number to its packet; the sequence number starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each subsequent packet. The destination maintains a 'sliding window' record of the sequence numbers of validated received packets; it rejects all packets which have a sequence number which is lower than the lowest in the sliding window (i.e. too old) or already appears in the sliding window (i.e. duplicates/replays). Accepted packets, once validated, update the sliding window (displacing the lowest sequence number out of the window if it was already full).\n\nSee also Replay attack.\n"}

It is the capital of the district Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen. In 2010 its population was 17,513.\n\nWeißenburg was a Free Imperial City for 500 years.\n\nWeissenburg is located in central Bavaria, in the south of the administrative region Mittelfranken. Large cities in the area are Ingolstadt (55.5 km), Nuremberg (61.7 km), Augsburg (85 km), Munich (134.6 km) and Würzburg (150.4 km).\n\nThe municipality is divided into 27 \"Ortsteile\": the main town and the 26 villages of Dettenheim, Emetzheim, Gänswirtshaus, Haardt, Hagenbuch, Hammermühle, Hattenhof, Häuser am Wülzburger Berg, Heuberg, Holzingen, Kattenhochstatt, Kehl, Laubenthal, Markhof, Niederhofen, Oberhochstatt, Potschmühle, Rohrwalk, Rothenstein (Weißenburg), Schleifer am Berg, Schmalwiesen, Stadelhof, Suffersheim, Weimersheim, Weissenhof and Wülzburg.\n\nThe history of Weißenburg is generally traced back to the Roman fort that was built in the area towards the end of the first century. The settlement, which included Thermae, lay on the border of the Roman Empire and on the Tabula Peutingeriana from the 4th century it had the name Biriciana. Germanic tribes destroyed the fort and settled in what is still the city centre. The first mention of the name Weißenburg is in a deed dating from 867. The city became the seat of a royal residence during the reign of the Franks and according to legend, Charlemagne stayed there to supervise the construction of Fossa Carolina.\n\nThe city became a Free Imperial City in 1296 and continued to grow until the Reformation. Following the example of Nuremberg the city joined the Protestant side but it suffered heavily in the ensuing wars. However, the rights of the city as a Free Imperial City and an Imperial Estate were restored in the final peace treaty and some growth resumed. Despite its insignificant size and economic importance, the city, like the other 50-odd free imperial cities, was virtually independent.\n\nWeissenburg lost its independence in 1802 and became part of the Bavarian kingdom in 1806. It was however saved from insignificance with the construction of a railway between Nuremberg and Augsburg which goes through the city and which supported industrialisation. Following World War II over 6,000 refugees and people expelled from the territories which Germany lost settled in the city and have since played an important role in its industry and culture.\n\nThe many stages in the history of Weissenburg can still be seen today. There are many ruins from the Roman times. One of the finest is the remains of a Roman bath which was excavated in 1977 and has been turned into a museum. The city wall from the Middle Ages has survived almost intact with its towers and in the Gothic Town Hall the city's elected members have held their meetings from 1476.\n\n\nWülzburg is a historic fortress about east of the centre of Weissenburg. It stands on a hill above Weissenburg, at an elevation of , and was originally a Benedictine monastery dating from the 11th century. It was converted into a fortress from 1588 to 1605 and is one of the best-preserved Renaissance fortresses in Germany. Today it is part of the city of Weissenburg.\n\nDuring World War I, the future French leader Charles De Gaulle was imprisoned at the Wülzburg. The Nazis also used it as a prison camp during World War II; it was here that the Czech composer Erwin Schulhoff was held for over a year before he died of TB.\n\n\n\n"}

Normal weight at term delivery is 2500–4200 g (5 pounds 8 ounces – 9 pounds 4 ounces).\n\nLBW is either caused by preterm birth (that is, a low gestational age at birth, commonly defined as younger than 37 weeks of gestation) or the infant being small for gestational age (that is, a slow prenatal growth rate), or a combination of both.\n\nIn general, risk factors in the mother that may contribute to low birth weight include young ages, multiple pregnancies, previous LBW infants, poor nutrition, heart disease or hypertension, untreated coeliac disease, drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and insufficient prenatal care. It can also be caused by PPROM. Environmental risk factors include smoking, lead exposure, and other types of air pollutions.\n\nFour different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension, decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection. From a practical point a number of factors have been identified that are associated with preterm birth, however, an association does not establish causality.\n\nBeing small for gestational age can be constitutional, that is, without an underlying pathological cause, or it can be secondary to intrauterine growth restriction, which, in turn, can be secondary to many possible factors. For example, babies with congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities are often associated with LBW. Problems with the placenta can prevent it from providing adequate oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Infections during pregnancy that affect the fetus, such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, may also affect the baby's weight.\n\nWhile active maternal tobacco smoking has well established adverse perinatal outcomes such as LBW, that mothers who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely to give birth to low-birth weight infants. Review on the effects of passive maternal smoking, also called environmental tobacco exposure (ETS), demonstrated that increased risks of infants with LBW were more likely to be expected in ETS-exposed mothers.\n\nRegarding environmental toxins in pregnancy, elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women, even those well below 10 ug/dL can cause miscarriage, premature birth, and LBW in the offspring. With 10 ug/dL as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's “level of concern”, this cut-off value really needs to arise more attentions and implementations in the future.\n\nThe combustion products of solid fuel in developing countries can cause many adverse health issues in people. Because a majority of pregnant women in developing countries, where rate of LBW is high, are heavily exposed to indoor air pollution, increased relative risk translates into substantial population attributable risk of 21% of LBW.\n\nThe potentially harmful effects of air pollution are particularly concerning given the pervasiveness of air pollution. The exact mechanism by which air pollution affects fetuses is unknown, but it is suggested that air pollutants enter the body through direct diffusion or active transport. Once in the body, it is thought that air pollutants affect birth outcomes by oxidative stress, changes in hemodynamic factors, disruption of endocrine systems, and finally with genetic and epigenetic changes.\n\nOne environmental exposure which has been found to increase the risk of low birth weight is particulate matter, a component of ambient air pollution. Because particulate matter is composed of extremely small particles, even nonvisible levels can be inhaled and present harm to the fetus. Particulate matter exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta, all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight. When inhaled, particles smaller than 1 µm can penetrate the alveolar wall, enter the maternal bloodstream so that particles and inflammatory mediators cross the placenta, and reach the fetus. Some studies have indicated that PM2.5 exposure during the second trimester may lead to the strongest effects on low birth weight. To reduce exposure to particulate matter, pregnant women can monitor the EPA’s Air Quality Index and take personal precautionary measures such as reducing outdoor activity on low quality days, avoiding high-traffic roads/intersections, and/or wearing personal protective equipment (i.e., facial mask of industrial design). Indoor exposure to particulate matter can also be reduced through adequate ventilation, as well as use of clean heating and cooking methods.\n\nOther environmental exposures that have been shown to increase the rates of low birth weight are compounds that are associated with traffic-related pollution, most significantly, nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Nitrogen dioxide is often used as an indicator of traffic-related air pollution. Stieb et al. used national data to study the association between nitrogen dioxide exposure and pregnancy outcomes in 2.5 million births in Canada between 1999 and 2008 using land use regression models to estimate nitrogen dioxide concentrations. They found that exposure to nitrogen dioxide was associated with 4% higher odds of giving birth to a child that is small for gestational age. Even after the researchers adjusted for neighborhood socioeconomic factors, there was still a strong association between nitrogen dioxide and low birth weight. This research also showed evidence of a dose-response relationship, meaning that more exposure to nitrogen dioxide an expectant mother was exposed to, the higher the likelihood of giving birth to a low birth weight child.\n\nThe association between traffic related pollution and low birth weight has been observed in multiple studies conducted in different parts of the world. Généreux et al. studied a population of Canadian women and found that living close to highways is associated with adverse birth outcomes, even among women considered high socioeconomic status. Ghosh et al. examined 4 air toxin monitoring stations in Los Angeles, California, and found that the odds of a low birth weight child increased by 2-5% when mothers were exposed to nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, these researchers found that traffic exhaust leads to low birth weight in long-term and short-term exposure, especially in the third trimester. In a study of Swedish newborn children, researchers used ultrasound techniques to show that exposure to nitrogen oxides consistently and negatively affected fetal growth late in pregnancy (after 7 months). Furthermore, they found that the population that was affected had relatively low exposures, which were generally below WHO air quality guidelines.\n\nAnother measure of air pollution is exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from motor vehicle exhaust, which has been associated with a 1-3% increased odds of low birth weight. It is hypothesized that hydrocarbons, which can cross into the placenta, have antiestrogenic effects and also cause DNA damage that leads to apoptosis or cell death.\n\nA correlation between maternal exposure to CO and low birth weight has been reported that the effect on birth weight of increased ambient CO was as large as the effect of the mother smoking a pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy. \nIt has been revealed that adverse reproductive effects (e.g., risk for LBW) were correlated with maternal exposure to air pollution combustion emissions in Eastern Europe and North America.\nMercury is a known toxic heavy metal that can harm fetal growth and health, and there has been evidence showing that exposure to mercury (via consumption of large oily fish) during pregnancy may be related to higher risks of LBW in the offspring.\n\nIt has also been hypothesized that another air pollutant, ozone, can cause low birth weight. While ozone has been associated with preterm delivery, studies linking ozone and low birth weight have been inconsistent. Some have shown a positive association between the two, others have shown no association, and some have found that ozone may actually be a protective factor against low birth weight. This last phenomenon is potentially explained by studies that have shown that ozone can activate an antioxidant system, which may help bring oxygen to tissues.\n\nIt was revealed that, exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with low birth weight. Aircraft noise exposure caused adverse effects on fetal growth leading to low birth weight and preterm infants.\n\nLow birthweight, pre-term birth and pre-eclampsia have been associated with maternal periodontitis exposure. But the strength of the observed associations is inconsistent and vary according to the population studied, the means of periodontal assessment and the periodontal disease classification employed. However the best is that the risk of low birth weight can be reduced with very simple therapy. Treatment of periodontal disease during gestation period is safe and reduction in inflammatory burden reduces the risk of preterm birth as well as low birth weight.\n\nLBW is closely associated with fetal and Perinatal mortality and Morbidity, inhibited growth and cognitive development, and chronic diseases later in life. At the population level, the proportion of babies with a LBW is an indicator of a multifaceted public-health problem that includes long-term maternal malnutrition, ill health, hard work and poor health care in pregnancy. On an individual basis, LBW is an important predictor of newborn health and survival and is associated with higher risk of infant and childhood mortality.\n\nLow birth weight constitutes as sixty to eighty percent of the infant mortality rate in developing countries. Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually directly causal, stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, PPROM, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of prenatal care, maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environment. According to an analysis by University of Oregon, reduced brain volume in children is also tied to low birth-weight.\n\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that of the 3.8 million births that occurred in the United States in 2011, approximately 6.1% (231,900) were diagnosed with low birth weight (<2,500 g). Approximately 49,300 newborns (1.3%) weighed less than 1,500 grams (VLBW). Infants born at low birth weight are at a higher risk for developing neonatal infection.\n"}

{"id": "1973385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973385", "title": "Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act", "text": "Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n\nThe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), , codified as et seq., is a United States federal law that prohibits the imposition of burdens on the ability of prisoners to worship as they please and gives churches and other religious institutions a way to avoid zoning law restrictions on their property use. It also defines the term \"religious exercise\" to include \"any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\" RLUIPA was enacted by the United States Congress in 2000 to correct the problems of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. The act was passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate by unanimous consent in voice votes, meaning that no objection was raised to its passage, so no written vote was taken. The S. 2869 legislation was enacted into law by the 42nd President of the United States Bill Clinton on September 22, 2000.\n\nIn 1997, the United States Supreme Court held the RFRA to be unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments, in \"City of Boerne v. Flores\", 521 U.S. 507. Unlike the RFRA, which required religious accommodation in virtually all spheres of life, RLUIPA only applies to prisoner and land use cases.\n\nIn \"Employment Div. Dep't of Human Resources v. Smith\", 494 U.S. 872, 883–85 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a substantial burden on religious exercise was subject to very strict scrutiny where the law \"lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.\" It was not a case permitting exceptions for freedom of religion when generally applicable health and welfare regulations were in question, and it should be remembered that Smith lost this case (involving a denial of unemployment benefits where the litigant had used illegal drugs in a religious ceremony). In line with the scrutiny regime established in \"West Coast Hotel v. Parrish\" in 1937, the Court ruled that unless the law is not one of general applicability, regardless of specific circumstance, government may act if policy is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, even if the act imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion.\n\nIn the 2005 case of \"Cutter v. Wilkinson\", 544 U.S. 709 (2005), five prisoners in Ohio – including a Wiccan, a Satanist, and a member of a racist, allegedly Christian, sect – successfully sought to apply the protections of the act to their religious practices. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had held that RLUIPA violated the Establishment Clause by impermissibly advancing religion by bestowing benefits to religious prisoners that were unavailable to non-religious prisoners.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, unanimously holding that RLUIPA was a permissible accommodation of religion justified by the fact that the government itself had severely burdened the prisoners' religious rights through the act of incarceration. A concurring opinion by Justice Thomas noted that the states could escape the restrictions of RLUIPA simply by refusing federal funds for state prisons.\n\n\"Cutter v. Wilkinson\" only concerns the prisoner portion of RLUIPA. The court explicitly declined to extend the rule to land use cases.\n\nIn a unanimous opinion issued March 15, 2011, that reverses the three-judge panel's May 2010 ruling, a limited \"en banc\" panel of 11 judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an Orange County courthouse lockup is an \"institution\" under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, meaning a Muslim woman who sued after being forced to remove her headscarf in front of strange men is entitled to the act's protections. The case is \"Khatib v. County of Orange\", 08-56423. The lawsuit started as a result of court bailiffs ordering the woman to remove her headscarf while she was temporarily being held inside the courthouse lock up while a county court judge was deciding whether or not to revoke her misdemeanor probation (she was released that same day after the judge decided not to). The District Court had dismissed the case, with said dismissal being upheld by the three-judge appellate panel. The case has now been reversed and sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. It is the first time that a temporary holding facility (like a courthouse lockup) has been deemed to be an \"institution\" under the Act. The law, passed by Congress in 2000, prohibits the government from imposing a \"substantial burden\" on prisoners' religious practices unless officials can show a compelling need for the restrictions. The Obama administration joined Khatib in arguing that the law applied to courthouse holding cells.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report entitled \"Enforcing Religious Freedom in Prison.\"\n\nIn religious land use disputes, RLUIPA's general rule is the most commonly cited and challenged section. It provides:\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a).\n\nDuring these disputes, the correct interpretation of the term \"land use regulation\" is almost always an issue. The statute defines \"land use regulation\" as \"a zoning or landmarking law, or the application of such a law, that limits or restricts a claimant's use or development of land (including a structure affixed to land), if the claimant has an ownership, leasehold, easement, servitude, or other property interest in the regulated land or a contract or option to acquire such an interest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(5).\n\nThe passage of RLUIPA gave rise to increasing number of legal cases whereby (local) planning authorities are sued for violating the free exercise of religion. RLUIPA, therefore, generated heated discussions within professional planning communities. While its advocates (mostly in Congress) argued that this federal statute prevents urban planners from substantially burdening religious practice, its critics (many of whom were planning practitioners) maintained that RLUIPA, in fact, substantially burdens planning practice itself. The American Planning Association (APA), for example, opposed RLUIPA (and its predecessor, RFRA) from the outset, arguing that these statutes effectively change “the playing field in favor of religious institutions” and put local governments “in an untenable position.” In 2005, however, the Supreme Court ruled, in Cutter v. Wilkinson, that RLUIPA is constitutional, at least as it applies to prisons. Since the mid-2000s, therefore, the APA has been offering vital resources to local governments and practicing planners as to how to effectively navigate the renewed legal-religious landscape of the planning field. \n\nLitigation focusing on the term \"land use regulation\" occasionally asks courts to decide whether RLUIPA applies to eminent domain proceedings. Generally, courts deciding this question have held that RLUIPA does not apply to eminent domain because it is not a \"zoning or landmarking law.\" Instead, these courts have held that zoning and eminent domain are two completely different and unrelated concepts. The main argument to support this conclusion is that zoning and eminent domain are derived from two separate sources of power. The zoning power is derived from the state's police power, while the eminent domain power is derived from the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution's Fifth Amendment. However, at least one court has applied the RLUIPA in an eminent-domain case because the authority to condemn the property came from the city's zoning scheme. A court may be more inclined to find that eminent domain falls within the scope of RLUIPA if it was authorized by a zoning ordinance or comprehensive plan.\n\nTo date, no cases questioning RLUIPA's application to eminent domain have reached the Supreme Court. A 2003 Seventh Circuit case, \"St. John's United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago\", was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the court declined to hear the appeal. A refusal to hear means that the Supreme Court did not consider the Seventh Circuit Court's decision to be obviously wrong on the legal merits, or that the facts of the particular case could have broader constitutional implications. The Supreme Court generally has a substantial workload and tends to refuse appeals which have already received due process in lower courts. A refusal to hear a case does not preclude hearing a similar case in the future, if the court feels that further judicial review is needed.\n\nThe controversy in this case centered around the expansion of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. In order to expand this airport, the City needed to acquire of adjacent land through condemnation. Among the properties to be condemned were two cemeteries, one owned by St. John's United Church of Christ, and the other by Rest Haven Cemetery Association. In their amended complaint, St. John's and Rest Haven alleged that condemnation of their cemeteries was a violation of RLUIPA. After a revision to the O'Hare Modernization Project, Rest Haven's cemetery was no longer faced with condemnation and this church dropped out of the lawsuit.\n\nSt. John's Church argued that the condemnation action substantially burdened its freedom of religious practice because \"[A] major tenet of its religious beliefs [was] that the remains of those buried at the [St. John's] St. Johannes Cemetery must not be disturbed until God raises these remains on the 'Day of Resurrection'.\" This Court had to decide whether eminent domain fit within RLUIPA's definition of a \"land use regulation.\" The Court held that eminent domain was not a \"land use regulation.\" The Court cited the case of \"Faith Temple Church v. Town of Brighton\" to support its position that \"zoning and eminent domain are 'two distinct concepts' that involve land in 'very different ways'.\"\n\nSt. John's Church also argued that the O'Hare Modernization Act, which authorized the condemnations, was a zoning law, and it invoked the protection of RLUIPA's in condemnation cases derived from the Act. The Court rejected this argument and suggested that Congress would have included eminent domain in the language of RLUIPA if it had intended for the statute to cover eminent domain. After considering the case, the Seventh Circuit Court denied St. John's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nCottonwood Christian Center filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the City of Cypress from taking its land through eminent domain. The controversy in this case arose when Cottonwood purchased land in Cypress and planned to build a large church and other church-related buildings on an plot of land. Since the church was to be built in an area that only allowed churches if they received a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) from Cypress, Cottonwood applied for a CUP. Cypress denied Cottonwood's application. Instead, the city planned to build a shopping mall that included Cottonwood's land. They later scaled the mall down to a Costco store that was solely on Cottonwood's plot. Cypress offered to purchase the land and Cottonwood did not accept. As a result, Cypress initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire the property under a zoning ordinance called the Los Alamitos Race Track and Golf Course Redevelopment Project (LART Plan). The LART Plan authorized the use of eminent domain as a way to redevelop the area where Cottonwood's land was located. Cottonwood argued that because the eminent domain proceedings stemmed from the LART Plan zoning scheme, they violated RLUIPA.\n\nThe Court granted a preliminary injunction against Cypress. The Court held that RLUIPA applied in this case, and therefore, the Court used a strict scrutiny standard of review. In its analysis, the Court found that it took Cottonwood five years to identify a location and negotiate for the land. After all the church had invested, the City's actions placed a substantial burden on the churches' religious exercise without presenting a compelling government interest for doing so.\n\nFaith Temple Church brought an action to enjoin the Town of Brighton from condemning its property through eminent domain. Faith Temple was a church that had outgrown its needs at its original location. In order to accommodate its larger congregation, it negotiated and eventually purchased a parcel of land in January 2004. In its Comprehensive Plan for 2000, the Town had included a recommendation that this parcel be acquired. The purpose of the acquisition was to expand an adjacent town-owned park. After the church purchased the land, the Town initiated condemnation proceedings in the spring of 2004.\n\nRLUIPA's application to eminent domain was at issue in this case because Faith Temple argued that the recommendation in the Town's Comprehensive Plan was essentially a \"zoning law.\" Further, if the recommendation was a zoning law, then Faith Temple argued that condemnation was \"the application of a zoning law\" and was a violation of RLUIPA.\n\nThe Court held that RLUIPA was inapplicable to this case. The judge found that the connection between zoning and eminent domain in this case was \"too attenuated to constitute the application of a zoning law.\" Therefore, summary judgment was granted in favor of the Town, denying injunctive relief.\n\nThis case was an appeal to the Supreme Court of Hawaii which stemmed from a Honolulu city and county ordinance. The ordinance gave the city and county eminent domain authority in \"[A]ctions for [ ] lease-to-fee conversion[s] of certain leased-fee interests.\" Using the authority granted by the ordinance, the City of Honolulu initiated condemnation proceedings to obtain thirty-four leasehold condominium units in the Admiral Thomas condominium complex. The purpose behind the condemnation proceedings was to \"conver[t] the leasehold [interests] to fee simple [interests] on behalf of forty-seven owner-occupant[s]\" (the lessees).\n\nThe plaintiff-appellee in the action was the City and the defendant-appellant was First United Methodist Church as the fee owner of the Admiral Thomas condominium complex. First United counterclaimed the condemnation proceedings and cited a violation of RLUIPA. Using the \"Cottonwood\" case for support, First United argued that eminent domain is a \"land use regulation\" and that RLUIPA should be a defense to the City's action. While First United argued that its exercise of religion had been burdened by the eminent domain proceedings, the City argued that First United had not proven this and that \"the Church's exercise of religion [was] unaffected.\"\n\nAffirming the decision of the circuit court granting summary judgment in favor of the City, the Court held that RLUIPA could not be used as a defense to eminent domain proceedings authorized under the ordinance. The Court supported this holding by stating that eminent domain and zoning are different concepts and that it would not \"assume that Congress simply overlooked [eminent domain] when drafting RLUIPA.\" Since Congress did not include the term \"eminent domain\" in the RLUIPA statute, the Court decided that Congress did not want it to be included. Therefore, the Court did not apply RLUIPA in this case.\n\n\n"}

Usually, they do not hold any office or have any official authority at the royal court but influence their ruler behind the scenes. Consequently, they also escape having to bear responsibility for the effects of their advice. The term derives from the Spanish word \"camarilla\" (diminutive of \"cámara\"), meaning \"little chamber\" or private cabinet of the king. It was first used of the circle of cronies around Spanish King Ferdinand VII (reigned 1814-1833). The term involves what is known as cronyism. The term also entered other languages like the German and Greek, and is used in the sense given above.\n\nA similar concept in modern politics is that of a Kitchen Cabinet, which is often composed of unelected advisers bypassing traditional governance practices.\n\nIn particular, two groups are called camarillas: those who surrounded the Emperor Wilhelm II and the President Paul von Hindenburg.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 19th century, Russia's government was frequently described as a \"camarilla\", starting as early as 1860.

The original WebMediaBrands was established in 1994, and headquartered in New York. Founded by Alan M. Meckler and Tristan Louis, the company provides business-to-business (B2B) services for creative, business and information technology professionals, including recruitment and event promotion.\n\nUntil 2014, the company also operated a group of websites aimed towards the B2B market—particularly blogs covering various aspects of the media industry. In August 2014, Mediabistro sold its editorial properties to Prometheus Global Media, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, for $8 million.\n\nThe company announced it would liquidate itself on December 22, 2015 \n\nIn 1994, Alan Meckler, then CEO of Mecklermedia, created MecklerWeb as an addendum to his offerings in print (\"Virtual Reality World\", \"CDrom World\", and \"Internet World\") and conferences (Internet World, Virtual Reality World). In 1995, as advertising-supported publishing emerged as a viable business model on the Web, the Website was relaunched by Tristan Louis under the name iWorld and began to publish content for the nascent Internet industry. As the Internet World conference prospered, iWorld set out on a strategy of acquiring successful Websites that were focused on technology content, such as Webopedia, SearchEngineWatch and WebReference. In 1997, the online division was renamed internet.com, after acquiring rights to the domain name from The Internet Company.\n\nIn 1998, Mecklermedia Corp. was acquired by Penton Media and the online assets were spun off into a separate company called Internet.com LLC. Internet.com went public on the NASDAQ in the second half of 1999 (trading as INTM). In 1999, internet.com Corp. launched the Search Engine Strategies conference and in 2000, it acquired Earthweb and incorporated it into the JupiterWeb network. In 2002, the company purchased the Jupiter Research business from Jupiter Media Metrix and renamed itself from INT Media to Jupitermedia, with a new stock ticker symbol JUPM.\n\nIn 2004, the company started acquiring image assets and developed Jupiterimages as a separate stock photography division, which operated two online image libraries, stock.xchng, a library of free-to-use photographs and illustrations, and StockXpert, a low-cost Microstock photography site.\n\nIn 2005, Jupitermedia sold SearchEngineWatch to Incisive Media. In 2006, Jupitermedia sold its JupiterResearch division to MCG Capital Corporation. In 2007, the company operates as two divisions, JupiterImages and Jupiter Online Media.\n\nIn 2008, JupiterResearch was acquired by Forrester Research.\n\nIn October 2008, Jupitermedia announced that they would be selling their online images division, Jupiterimages, to the stock photography agency Getty Images for $96 million in cash. The sale went ahead in February 2009; Jupiterimages (including the sites stock.xchng and StockXpert) is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Getty.\n\nFollowing the sale, JupiterMedia changed its name to WebMediaBrands Inc. In August 2009, Quinstreet Inc. acquired the Internet.com division of WebMediaBrands for $18 million.

{"id": "1973409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973409", "title": "LAV III", "text": "LAV III\n\nThe LAV III, originally named the Kodiak by the Canadian Army, is the third generation of the Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV) family of infantry fighting vehicles built by General Dynamics Land Systems – Canada (GDLS-C), a London, Ontario based subsidiary of General Dynamics that first entered service in 1999. It was developed in Canada and is the primary mechanized infantry vehicle of both the Canadian Army and the New Zealand Army. It also forms the basis of the Stryker vehicle used by the US Army and other operators.\n\nBy July 1991, the Canadian Armed Forces had identified the need to replace their aging fleet of 1960s and 1970s era armoured personnel carriers. As a result, $2.8 billion was earmarked for the Multi-Role Combat Vehicle (MRCV) project by the sitting Conservative government. The mandate of the MRCV project was to provide a series of vehicles based on a common chassis which would replace the M113 armored personnel carrier, Lynx reconnaissance vehicle, Grizzly armoured personnel carrier, and Bison armoured personnel carrier. The project was, however, deemed unaffordable and cancelled by March 1992.\n\nBy 1994, after the Liberal Party had returned to government, the army was still in need of new vehicles. As a result, the army embarked on the Light Armoured Vehicle Project, which would adapt parts of the MRCV Project, and be implemented incrementally to spread out the costs. Also, the requirement to replace the Bisons was dropped. The first phase of the project saw the selection of the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle to replace the Lynx.\n\nOn August 16, 1995, it was announced that General Motors Diesel Division (later renamed GM Defense, and subsequently purchased by General Dynamics Land Systems of London, Ontario) had been awarded the contract to produce the LAV III which would replace the Grizzly and a large portion of the M113 armoured personnel carriers. The LAV III would incorporate the turret and weapon system used with the Coyote (which was produced at the same location).\n\nIn July 2009, the Canadian Department of National Defence announced that $5 billion would be spent to enhance, replace and repair the army's armoured vehicles. Part of the spending would be used to replace and repair damaged LAV III's due to wear and tear from operations in Afghanistan. As much as 33 percent of the army's light armoured vehicles were out of service. Furthermore, the LAV III's will be upgraded with improved protection and automotive components. The Canadian Armed Forces has lost over 34 vehicles and 359 were damaged during the mission in Afghanistan. The Canadian army has lost 13 LAVs and more than 159 were damaged by roadside bombs or enemy fire. Of the $5 billion announced, approximately 20% of it will be used to upgrade LAV III models. The upgrade will extend the LAV III life span to 2035. The remaining $4 billion is to be spent on a \"new family of land combat vehicles\". The Department of National Defence considered the purchase of vehicles meant to accompany the Leopard 2 and to sustain the LAV III into combat. The CV90, the Puma (IFV) and the Véhicule blindé de combat d'infanterie were the most likely candidates for the role. A contract of 108 with an option for up to 30 more was considered, but a combination of budget cuts and upgrades to the existing fleet of LAV IIIs have led the Canadian Army to cancel its order for 108 CV90s.\n\nOn October 21, 2011, the Canadian government announced a $1.1 billion contract to General Dynamics Land Systems to upgrade 550 LAV III combat vehicles. The government said the upgrade is needed to improve protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which have been the cause of a number of Canadian deaths in Afghanistan. The improvements will also extend the service of the vehicles up to 2035 and will boost troop mobility. The upgrades include a new and more powerful engine, increased armour protection, steering and brake systems. The turret hatches on the LAV III would be made larger and improved fire control, thermal, day and low-light sights, and data displays. The weight of the vehicle would increase from to . The first of 66 upgraded LAV IIIs was delivered on February 1, 2013. The success of the upgrade program and budget pressures led to the cancellation of the Close Combat Vehicle replacement program later that year.\n\nIn September 2012, the original contract valued to at $1.064 billion to upgrade the 550 LAV III's variants, an infantry section carrier, a command post, an observation post and an engineer vehicle to the LAV VI configuration, was modified. This included an additional $151 million to upgrade 66 LAV III's to the LAV VI with a LAV Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (LRSS) fitted.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, General Dynamics Land Systems – Canada of London, Ontario, was awarded a $404 million order to work on 141 LAV Operational Requirement Integration Task (LORIT) vehicles. This contract will upgrade the remaining LAV III fleet in the Canadian Army to the LAV VI configuration. This brings the Canadian Army's Light Armoured Vehicle III Upgrade (LAVUP) program to a total cost of $1.8 billion.\n\nFinal completion and delivery of the Canadian Army's Light Armoured Vehicle III Upgrade (LAVUP) to upgrade the LAV III to the LAV VI is expected to be completed by December 2019.\n\nThe LAV III is powered by a Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine developing and can reach speeds above 100 kilometres per hour. The vehicle is fitted with 8x8 drive and also equipped with a central tire inflation system, which allows it to adjust to different terrain, including off-road. The LAV III is fitted with a modern anti-locking brake system (ABS). Unlike earlier versions of the LAV, the LAV III does not have amphibious capabilities.\nThe LAV III faces the same concerns that most other wheeled military vehicles face. Like all wheeled armoured vehicles, the LAV III's ground pressure is inherently higher than a tracked vehicle with a comparable weight. This is because tires will have less surface area in contact with the ground when compared to a tracked vehicle. Higher ground pressure results in an increased likelihood of sinking into soft terrain such as mud, snow and sand, leading to the vehicle becoming stuck. The lower ground pressure and improved traction offered by tracked vehicles also gives them an advantage over vehicles like the LAV III when it comes to managing slopes, trenches, and other obstacles.\n\nThe LAV III can somewhat compensate for these effects by deflating its tires slightly, meaning that the surface area in contact with the ground increases, and the ground pressure is slightly lowered.\n\nHowever, wheels offer several advantages over tracked vehicles, including lower maintenance for both the vehicle and road infrastructure, quieter movement for improved stealth, greater speed over good terrain, and higher ground clearance. Wheeled vehicle crews are also more likely to survive mine or IED attacks than the crew of a similarly armoured tracked vehicle.\n\nThe LAV III's turret gives the vehicle a higher centre of gravity than the vehicle was initially designed for. This has led to concerns that the vehicle is more likely to roll over on uneven terrain.\n\nWhile there have been several recorded rollovers (about 16), the most common cause was found to be unstable terrain, specifically road shoulders unexpectedly giving away beneath the vehicle. The weight balance of the LAV III is taken into consideration during driver training, largely mitigating the chances of a rollover. It is considered one of the safest and most well-rounded vehicles of its kind in the world.\n\nThe basic armour of the LAV III, covering the Standardization Agreement STANAG 4569 level III, which provides all-round protection against 7.62×51mm NATO small calibre rounds. A ceramic appliqué armour (MEXAS) can be added, which protects against 14.5×114mm heavy calibre rounds from 500 meters. In December 2008 the Government of Canada awarded EODC Engineering, Developing and Licensing Inc. C$81.5 million worth of contracts to provide for add-on-armour kits, modules and spares for its LAV III wheeled armoured personnel carriers. This armour kit is intended to provide increased protection against improvised explosive devices (IED), explosively formed penetrators and 30 mm caliber armour piercing rounds. The LAV III can be also fitted with cage armour, which provides protection against shaped charges. The LAV III is fitted with a nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) filtration system accompanied with a GID-3 chemical detector and AN/VDR-2 radiation detector systems. The LAV III was designed to produce a very low and very compact structure to minimize radar and IR-signatures. The LAV III also uses heat-absorbing filters to provide temporary protection against thermal imaging (TIS), image intensifiers and infrared cameras (IR). General Dynamics is in the process of integrating the LAV III with an active protection system based on the Israeli Trophy system.\n\nThe majority of Canadian casualties in Afghanistan have occurred during a patrol aboard a LAV III. This can be explained by the fact that the LAV III is the most commonly used Canadian armoured personnel carrier in theatre, and simply represents a normal association between use and likelihood to encounter a mine or improvised explosive device. The LAV III offers comparable or better protection than most other infantry carriers used in Afghanistan. In an effort to improve protection as a result of experiences in Afghanistan, future LAV III upgrades will likely include improved mine and IED protection.\n\nThe LAV III is fitted with a two-man turret, armed with the M242 Bushmaster 25 mm caliber chain gun and a coaxial 7.62-mm machine gun. One more 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm machine guns is positioned on top of the turret. The LAV III also has eight 76-mm grenade launchers in two clusters of four launchers positioned on each side of the turret. The grenade launchers are intended for smoke grenades. In 2009, a number of LAV III's were modified with a Nanuk remotely controlled weapon station (RCWS) to provide better protection and to increase the chances of survival of the crew against improvised explosive devices and anti-tank mine threats on the battlefield.\n\nThe LAV III is equipped with a daytime optical Thermal Imaging System (TIS) and Generation III Image Intensification (II). The LAV III is equipped with a Tactical Navigation System (TacNav) to assist in navigation and target location tasks. The LAV III is equipped with a LCD monitor directly connected to the vehicle's external cameras, providing real-time images of the battlefield for the passengers.\n\nThe LAV III and related versions have been used in the following:\n\nThe New Zealand armed forces purchased 105 LAV of which 102 were standard vehicles and 3 were redesigned for recovery.\n\nIn May 2009 two NZLAVs were deployed to support police during the 2009 Napier shootings. They protected specialist police while retrieving the body of a deceased police officer from outside the offender's residence.\n\nIn November 2009 it was announced that three NZLAVs would be deployed to assist NZSAS operations in Afghanistan and they were up-armoured. In 2011, these three LAVs were moved to Bamyan to support the provincial reconstruction team there as they were no longer needed in Kabul due to reduced SAS numbers. Five additional LAVs were also flown to Bamyan. One has since been damaged by a roadside bomb. In May 2012, the New Zealand government announced that it may leave all these LAVs behind in Afghanistan for use by local forces when the New Zealand forces leave in 2013. As of November 2013, all of these deployed LAVs had been returned to New Zealand.\n\nIn 2011, after the Christchurch earthquake, LAVs from Burnham Camp were deployed to assist police with securing the inner city during the nights.\n\nIn March 2016, two LAVs were deployed to assist with lifting a siege near Kawerau in the Bay of Plenty after four policemen were shot at and severely injured.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Convention also sets out which people do not qualify as refugees, such as war criminals. The Convention also provides for some visa-free travel for holders of refugee travel documents issued under the convention.\n\nThe Refugee Convention builds on Article 14 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the right of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries. A refugee may enjoy rights and benefits in a state in addition to those provided for in the Convention.\n\nThe rights created by the Convention generally still stand today. Some have argued that the complex nature of 21st century refugee relationships calls for a new treaty that recognizes the evolving nature of the nation-state, population displacement, environmental migrants, and modern warfare. Nevertheless, ideas like the principle of non-refoulement (Article 33) are still applied today, with the 1951 Convention being the source of such rights.\n\nThe Convention was approved at a special United Nations conference on 28 July 1951, and entered into force on 22 April 1954. It was initially limited to protecting European refugees from before 1 January 1951 (after World War II), though states could make a declaration that the provisions would apply to refugees from other places.\n\nThe 1967 Protocol removed the time limits and applied to refugees \"without any geographic limitation\", but declarations previously made by parties to the Convention on geographic scope were grandfathered.\n\nAs of 20 January 2020, there were 146 parties to the Convention, and 147 to the Protocol. Madagascar and Saint Kitts and Nevis are parties only to the Convention, while Cape Verde, the United States of America and Venezuela are parties only to the Protocol. Since the US ratified the Protocol in 1968, it undertook a majority of the obligations spelled out in the original 1951 document (Articles 2-34), and Article 1 as amended in the Protocol, as \"supreme Law of the Land\".\n\nArticle 1 of the Convention defines a refugee as:\nWith the passage of time and the emergence of new refugee situations, the need was increasingly felt to make the provisions of the 1951 Convention applicable to such new refugees. As a result, a Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees was prepared, and entered into force on 4 October 1967. The UNHCR is called upon to provide international protection to refugees falling within its competence. The Protocol defined \"refugee\" to mean any person within the 1951 Convention definition as if the words \"As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and ...\" were omitted. \n\nSeveral groups have built upon the 1951 Convention to create a more objective definition. While their terms differ from those of the 1951 Convention, the Convention has significantly shaped the new, more objective definitions. They include the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa by the Organisation of African Unity (since 2002 African Union) and the 1984 Cartagena Declaration, while nonbinding, also sets out regional standards for refugees in Central America, Mexico and Panama.\n\nIn the general principle of international law, treaties in force are binding upon the parties to it and must be performed in good faith. Countries that have ratified the Refugee Convention are obliged to protect refugees that are on their territory, in accordance with its terms. There are a number of provisions that States parties to the Refugee Convention must adhere to.\n\nRefugees shall\n\nThe contracting states shall\n\nThe contracting states shall not\n\nRefugees shall be treated at least like \"nationals\" in relation to\n\nRefugees shall be treated at least like \"other non-nationals\" in relation to\n\nAlthough the Convention is \"legally binding\" there is no body that monitors compliance. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has supervisory responsibilities, but cannot enforce the Convention, and there is no formal mechanism for individuals to file complaints. The Convention specifies that complaints should be referred to the International Court of Justice. It appears that no nation has ever done this.\n\nAn individual may lodge a complaint with the UN Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or with the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but no one has ever done so in regard to violations of the Convention. Nations may levy international sanctions against violators, but no nation has ever done this.\n\nAt present, the only real consequences of violation are 1) public shaming in the press, and 2) verbal condemnation of the violator by the UN and by other nations. To date these have not proven to be significant deterrents.\n\n\n\n"}
