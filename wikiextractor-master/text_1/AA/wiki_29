{"id": "1825957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825957", "title": "Filmstrip", "text": "Filmstrip\n\nThe filmstrip is a form of still image instructional multimedia, once commonly used by educators in primary and secondary schools (K-12), overtaken at the end of the 1980s by newer and increasingly lower-cost full-motion videocassettes and later on by DVDs. From the 1940s to 1980s, filmstrips provided an easy and inexpensive alternative to 16 mm educational films, requiring very little storage space and being very quick to rewind for the next use. Filmstrips were large and durable, and rarely needed splicing. They are still used in some areas.\n\nA filmstrip is a spooled roll of 35 mm positive film with approximately thirty to fifty images arranged in sequential order. Like 16 mm film, a filmstrip was inserted vertically down in front of the projector aperture, rather than horizontally as in a slide projector. Therefore, the frame size is smaller than normal 35 mm film. Two image frames of a filmstrip take up the same amount of space as a single 35mm frame, including its guard band, so that a 25 exposure 35mm film can contain 50 filmstrip images. Early celluloid filmstrips had a habit of melting or combusting from the intense and sustained heat of the projection lamp. These were called pictural filmstrips, the first filmstrips that were produced in a complete set.\n\nTypically, a filmstrip's running time was between ten and twenty minutes. Depending on how they were narrated or produced, filmstrips (which often came with an instructor's guide) were flexible enough to be used in both self-paced learning formats or a full classroom. In addition to a standard classroom wall or screen projector, personal film display units were available with a screen size of approximately eight inches diagonal for up-close viewing by one or two people.\n\nThe instructor would turn on a filmstrip projector that would show the first frame (image) of the filmstrip. The instructor then turned on a 33 RPM record or cassette tape containing the audio material for the filmstrip which included narration. At the appropriate point, a tone would sound, signaling the instructor to turn a knob, advancing to the next frame. Later, technical improvements allowed the projector to advance the film automatically.\nBy the later part of the 1960s, such firms as Warren Schloat Productions, CBS, The New York Times Company, Scott Education, Coronet Films, Sunburst Media, and Guidance Associates were producing titles featuring photographs by famous artists and of notable events with a synchronized audio track. The music and narration for the filmstrip originally came on a vinyl record.\n\nIn the 1970s, audio technology advanced, and vinyl records gave way to audio cassettes and became useful in providing individualized instruction. Students could now watch and listen to a filmstrip over and over at their own pace. Filmstrips also moved beyond traditional arts and humanities courses, branching into the science, career, vocational and technical subject areas led by such firms as Bergwall Productions and Prentice Hall Media (Formerly Warren Schloat Productions.) There were filmstrips produced in many different subject areas including music, art, language arts, math, business and even home economics.\n\nIn the early 1950s production companies started producing filmstrips for home entertainment. There were a number of films from Disney, and also from the Society for Visual Education Inc.(Chicago), among other manufacturers.\n\nFilm strips were popular in the USSR because movie projectors and VCRs were not in common use until the early 1990s. A great number of films were produced by the \"Diafilm\" studio. Many filmstrips were produced by \"cinematographic studios\" in former Soviet bloc countries such as Poland and Hungary during the 1950s–1960s.\nIn Greece they were known and sold by the name \"tainies Argo Film\" (ARGO FILM movies) from the name of the company (ARGO FILM) that translated the scripts into Greek and organized the productions' distribution in Greece. The titles included children's stories, fairy tales, Greek history, Christianity, adventure, science fiction and war stories.\n\nDuring the 1970s, advanced projectors became available, and these projectors would automatically advance the film by means of a 50 Hz subaudible tone recorded on the cassette that would be detected by the projector, and automatically advance the frame. Most cassettes accompanying filmstrips in the 1970s and 1980s would have the same audio material on both sides of the tape. One side would have audible tones for the older projectors, and the other side would have the subaudible tones for the newer automatic projectors. Some select filmstrip releases had both audible and subaudible tones combined, making the filmstrip and its companion cassette compatible with any filmstrip projector. If improperly set up, the narration and film would not be synchronized.\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the beginning of 1980, because most filmstrip publishers stopped making their sound filmstrip sets with LP records, audiovisual companies started producing automatic filmstrip projectors with built-in cassette players to better meet the audiovisual needs of teachers and school librarians. In 1979–1980 the DuKane Corporation in St. Charles, Illinois began to produce a cassette automatic filmstrip projector called the DuKane Micromatic II. This automatic filmstrip projector was easier to use by loading the filmstrip in the projector backward when the plastic upper film spring was flipped back. Loading the cassettes into the projector's cassette compartment was also easier with a control panel for the filmstrip and accompanying cassette. This filmstrip projector also had 50 Hz synchronization and could also be operated by remote control when set on manual mode. It was very popular with classroom and music teachers and school librarians. DuKane also produced their new line of silent filmstrip projectors which were also popular in schools. The La Belle Commpak system always use 1000 Hz tone to advance to the next slide. It will be embedded on to the Commpak 8track cartridge. Then it will be played on to la belle tutor 16/la belle duo 16 system. The general electric show 'n' tell record system use 16mm for film and record for audio and cool thing is the 16mm played upside down advance to the next frame. Simelar to la belle commpak system and dukane filmstrip projector the general electric show 'n' tell system contains any story on 1 16mm film format.\n\nThe 1980s brought the advent of the video cassette recorder (VCR), and advancing technology meant increasingly affordable VCRs. When VCRs became within reach for most schools' budgets, this marked beginning of a decline in filmstrip use. Video instruction combined the ease of the filmstrip with automatically synchronized audio and full motion video. By the early 1990s, the vast majority of filmstrip producers that were not equipped to compete with video either closed or sold their businesses.\n\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, some audiovisual companies (such as Society for Visual Education Inc., Educational Audio Visual, and Metro Audio Visual) were still producing filmstrips for schools and libraries. When VHS, DVD, multimedia projectors and computers became popular in schools and libraries, however, filmstrips ceased to be used in schools, and many public libraries no longer had filmstrips in their catalogs. By the mid-2000s many schools no longer wanted to purchase filmstrips, and audiovisual companies stopped producing them.\n\n\n"}

He attended Rugby School from 1916 where his musical talent for the piano, flute and theory was recognised, and studied at the Royal College of Music from 1921 to 1926. His composition teachers were Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams, and he studied harmony and counterpoint under R. O. Morris. He also studied organ.\n\nIn 1927, he married. Realising that he would not be able to make a living solely as a composer he worked for a time with the Aeolian Company correcting Duo-Art pianola rolls until 1930. He also taught part-time at Ludgrove School (where his pupils included the music enthusiast George Lascelles, later 7th Earl of Harewood) and at Downe House School. In 1929 he had met fellow-composer Gerald Finzi, with whom he found he had much in common, personally and musically, and the two formed a lifelong friendship.\n\nHis early compositions met with some success, his \"Double Fugue\" Op. 10 winning a Carnegie Prize and being performed by the London Symphony Orchestra under Ralph Vaughan Williams. In September 1931 his oratorio \"A Prophet in the Land\" Op. 21 was performed in Gloucester Cathedral as part of the Three Choirs Festival - the work was somewhat overshadowed by the splash made by William Walton's \"Belshazzar's Feast\" performed the same year. In 1937 a performance of his \"Concerto Grosso\" Op. 46 was directed by Malcolm Sargent, and his \"Violin Concerto\" Op. 47 was broadcast by the BBC in early 1938.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Milford volunteered for the army, and was posted to the Pioneer Corps. After just one week, he suffered a breakdown, and after treatment he and his family moved to Guernsey. His depression was deepened by the death of his mother in 1940. He returned to England, to teach and compose, but soon afterwards his five-year-old son, Barnaby, was killed in a road accident. His grief at this tragedy prompted him to attempt suicide; sent back to hospital after this, he tried to kill himself yet again while a patient there. In 1946, he had recovered sufficiently to resume teaching (at Badminton School) and to undertake musical activities. He continued composing throughout this period.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1952, he was prescribed occasional shock therapy. He did continue to enjoy successes: his \"Overture for a Celebration\" Op. 103 was performed under John Barbirolli at the 1955 Cheltenham Music Festival. He also continued to receive moral and material support from his friends, Finzi (who led a performance of \"Fishing by Moonlight\" Op 96 in 1956) and Vaughan Williams (who arranged a performance of the \"Concertino\" Op 106 in 1958, and gave financial help).\n\nThe deaths of Finzi (1956) and Vaughan Williams (1958) affected Milford deeply, aggravating the effects of his physical decline, which involved loss of vision and impaired balance. He died by his own hand, taking an overdose of aspirin in December 1959.\n\nIt has been observed that Milford's writing shows strongly the influence of Vaughan Williams, as might be expected. His use of diatonic melodies, often harmonised with gentle discords, and with false relations occurring occasionally, has led Erik Blom (1942) to crystallise these musical traits (also shown by other English composers of the period) as \"\"musical Englishry\"\". Vaughan Williams once wrote to Adrian Boult, \"If I wanted to show the intelligent foreigner something worth doing which could only possibly come out of England, I think I would show him something of the work of Milford…\"\n\nDespite the tragic events of Milford's life, and his resultant depression, he seems to have had a capacity for incidental enjoyment and his music is by no means gloomy. Indeed, a factor contributing to Milford's depression was that his brand of English music, as handed down from Vaughan Williams and Holst, was going out of fashion, and his music was not appreciated in a musical scene which was increasingly modernist even while Milford's own music was becoming more conservative.\n\nAs well as large scale works, Milford also wrote smaller pieces, for example organ pieces suitable for playing as church voluntaries (he was himself a village church organist) and piano works. Milford was able to show the character of a song setting with just a few notes, for example in the very brief piano introduction to \"If it's ever Spring Again\".\n\nRecordings of his music are few, although some of his music - some songs, his \"Mass for five voices\" Op. 84, \"Concertino\" Op. 106 and a selection of pieces including \"Fishing by Moonlight\" Op. 96 - are available.\n\nMilford's Suite for Oboe and String Orchestra, a composition of extraordinary beauty, was recorded by Cameo Classics with British oboist John McDonough and the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Michael Laus in 2011. The CD of premiere recordings (CC9032CD) is available from distributors, Nimbus Records.\n\nA more complete list may be found in Copley (1984).\n\nMilford's compositions include\n\n\n"}

It was released by Atlantic Records in 1990. Beau Hill produced the album. Although coming out at the decline of the melodic hard rock scene in the U.S., the release was a commercial success, prompting additional touring by the group.\n\nThe album was certified platinum and produced such hits as \"Can't Get Enuff\", \"Easy Come Easy Go\" and \"Miles Away\", the latter reaching the Top 20 in the Billboard's single chart. According to Kip Winger, \"Can't Get Enuff\" and \"Easy Come Easy Go\" were late additions to the track listing, written because it was felt there were not enough rock songs on the album. The album itself peaked at #15 at the album chart.\n\nWinger followed the release of the album with a 13-month world tour, playing with other hard rock and heavy metal groups such as Kiss, Scorpions, ZZ Top, Extreme and Slaughter.\nA collection of music videos with the same title was released the following year in two separate VHS volumes.\n\nMusically, \"In the Heart of the Young\" followed closely in the footsteps of the band's first album. The members, however, also made some notable changes in comparison to that, particularly given the new emphasis on both progressive rock elements and sentimental ballads.\n\nAt least two more songs were recorded during the \"In the Heart of the Young\" sessions, but \"All I Ever Wanted\" and \"Never\" did not make it to the final album in America, because the producer Beau Hill found them too heavy for the Winger sound. Both were originally released as B-sides. \"All I Ever Wanted\" was later released as a bonus track on the Japanese pressings of the album, while \"Never\" was later released on \"Demo Anthology\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe videos for \"Can't Get Enuff\" and \"Miles Away\" were made available on a 1990 VHS release entitled \"In the Heart of the Young, Vol. 1\".

The theory states that the genomes of three ancestral diploid species of \"Brassica\" combined to create three common tetraploid vegetables and oilseed crop species. It has since been confirmed by studies of DNA and proteins.\n\nThe theory is summarized by a triangular diagram that shows the three ancestral genomes, denoted by AA, BB, and CC, at the corners of the triangle, and the three derived ones, denoted by AABB, AACC, and BBCC, along its sides. \n\nThe theory was first published in 1935 by Woo Jang-choon, a Korean-Japanese botanist (writing under the Japanized name \"Nagaharu U\"). Woo made synthetic hybrids between the diploid and tetraploid species and examined how the chromosomes paired in the resulting triploids.\nThe six species are\n\nThe code in the \"Chr.Count\" column specifies the total number of chromosomes in each somatic cell, and how it relates to the number \"n\" of chromosomes in each full genome set (which is also the number found in the pollen or ovule), and the number \"x\" of chromosomes in each component genome. For example, each somatic cell of the tetraploid species \"Brassica napus\", with letter tags AACC and count \"2n=4x=38\", contains two copies of the A genome, each with 10 chromosomes, and two copies of the C genome, each with 9 chromosomes, which is 38 chromosomes in total. That is two full genome sets (one A and one C), hence \"2n=38\" which means \"n=19\" (the number of chromosomes in each gamete). It is also four component genomes (two A and two C), hence \"4x=38\". \n\nThe three diploid species exist in nature, but can easily interbred because they are closely related. This interspecific breeding allowed for the creation of three new species of tetraploid \"Brassica\". These are said to be allotetraploid (containing four genomes from two or more different species); more specifically, amphidiploid (with two genomes each from two diploid species). \n\nData from molecular studies indicate the three diploid species are themselves paleopolyploids.\n\nRecently, a novel allohexaploid (AABBCC) which is located at the \"center\" of the triangle of U has been created by different means , for example by crossing \"B. rapa\" (AA) with \"B. carinata\" (BBCC), or \"B. nigra\" (BB) with \"B. napus\" (AACC), or \"B. oleracea\" (CC) with \"B. juncea\" (AABB), followed by chromosome duplication of the triploid (ABC) offspring to generate doubled haploid (AABBCC) offspring.\n\n"}

Through royal intervention, it was determined and became custom that such jurisdiction was to be avoided.\n\nIn 1668, a London-based merchant, Thomas Skinner, presented a petition to Charles II asserting that he could not obtain any redress against the East India Company, which, he asserted, had injured his property, his free trading base in the Indian Ocean set up before the latter had an official monopoly.\n\nThe case was referred to the House of Lords, and Skinner obtained a verdict for £5,000 damages (). The company complained to the House of Commons which declared that the proceedings in the other House were illegal. The Lords defended their action, and after two conferences between the Houses had produced no result the Commons ordered Skinner to be put in prison on a charge of breach of privilege; to this the Lords replied by fining and imprisoning Sir Samuel Barnardiston, the chairman of the company.\n\nThen for about a year the dispute slumbered, but it was renewed in 1669, when Charles II advised the two Houses to stop all proceedings and to erase all mention of the case from their records. This was done and since this time the House of Lords has tacitly abandoned all claim to original jurisdiction (be a court of first instance) in civil suits.\n\n"}
{"id": "1825996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825996", "title": "Minimum contacts", "text": "Minimum contacts\n\nMinimum contacts is a term used in the United States law of civil procedure to determine when it is appropriate for a court in one state to assert personal jurisdiction over a defendant from another state. The United States Supreme Court has decided a number of cases that have established and refined the principle that it is unfair for a court to assert jurisdiction over a party unless that party's contacts with the state in which that court sits are such that the party \"could reasonably expect to be haled into court\" in that state. This jurisdiction must \"not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\". A non-resident defendant may have minimum contacts with the forum state if they 1) have direct contact with the state; 2) have a contract with a resident of the state; 3) have placed their product into the stream of commerce such that it reaches the forum state; 4) seek to serve residents of the forum state; 5) have satisfied the Calder effects test; or 6) have a non-passive website viewed within the forum state.\n\nBecause the need for minimum contacts is a matter of personal jurisdiction (the power of the court to hear the claim with respect to a particular party) instead of subject matter jurisdiction (the power of the court to hear this kind of claim at all), a party can explicitly or implicitly waive their right to object to the court hearing the case. Minimum contacts can be established by consent where a party signs a contract with a forum selection clause, agreeing to litigate in a specified forum.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party who wishes to object to the court's jurisdiction must first sign a clause stating that they agree on the matter and will follow all laws/ rules imposed by the state and/or country, or lose the ability to raise such an objection. Furthermore, a court may request that a party provide evidence that its contacts do not rise to the level which would allow the court to have jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has held that if a party refuses to comply with such a request, the court can deem them to have waived their right to object to jurisdiction.\n\nA party's activities within a state can provide the basis for that state to have jurisdiction over that party. The Supreme Court has held that the state can properly assert jurisdiction based on a party's \"purposeful availment of the benefits and protections\" offered by a state.\n\nThe necessary contacts that a party must have for a state to assert personal jurisdiction may vary depending on the relationship between the contacts and the claim brought against that party. \"General jurisdiction\" exists where a court in a given state has jurisdiction over a defendant in that state irrespective of the nature of the claim; but if the state is alleged to have jurisdiction over a defendant because the defendant's activities in that state gave rise to the claim itself, this would be \"specific jurisdiction\".\n\nFor example, if a Florida orange grower were to breach a promise to deliver a bushel of oranges to a buyer in Alabama, the breach of that agreement would be sufficient for Alabama courts to assert specific jurisdiction, even if the Florida grower had no other contacts with Alabama, and had never even set foot there. The lone contact of a promise to deliver something to a state is enough to give the state jurisdiction over disputes arising from the breach of that promise. (The mere presence of a contract is not enough to establish specific jurisdiction – \"Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz—\"something else is needed, maybe if there had been subsequent deliveries.) On the other hand, if one were to sue the Florida orange grower in Alabama for some matter other than that contract, the court would have to determine whether it could exercise general jurisdiction. \n\nIn \"Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall\", a helicopter crash caused the death of four Americans in Peru. The Supreme Court found that the state of Texas could not assert general personal jurisdiction over the defendant company that had negotiated the purchase of helicopters and trained its pilots in Texas, because its activities in that forum were not of a continuous and systematic nature. The U.S. Supreme Court has only found general jurisdiction in one case to date, \"Perkins v. Benguet Mining Co.\", though it is routinely found at lower levels.\n\nA party who receives service of process (formal notification that they are being sued) while physically present in a state is properly subject to personal jurisdiction in that state. The justification for the rule is uncertain. In \"Burnham v. Superior Court of California\", the Court unanimously agreed that this rule was still effective, but split as to the rationale. Justice Scalia wrote for four justices who felt that the rule should apply simply because it was a continuation of a longstanding tradition. Justice Brennan wrote for four justices who felt that the rule should apply because the party was purposefully availing himself of the benefits of being in the state at that time, and that the rule was fair under modern standards because it was well known, therefore putting defendants on notice of their susceptibility to suit in a state if physically present. The ninth vote, by Justice Stevens, agreed that jurisdiction was proper, but did not endorse either Scalia's or Brennan's test.\n\nMerely placing products in the \"stream of commerce\" is insufficient to provide minimum contacts with the states where the products end up. The defendant must make an effort to market in the forum state or otherwise purposefully avail himself of the resources of that state. However, since only four of the nine Supreme Court Justices joined the opinion that required a defendant to do more than place his products in a \"stream of commerce,\" some lower courts still rule that doing so is adequate for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction.\n\nClaims arising from the tort of defamation are treated by a different standard.\n\nCourts have struggled with the Internet as a source of minimum contacts. Although not determinately established by the Supreme Court, many courts use the \"Zippo\" test, which examines the kind of use to which a defendant's website is being put. Under this test, websites are divided into three categories:\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the mere fact of ownership of property within a state is \"not\" sufficient to provide minimum contacts for a court to hear cases unrelated to that property. However, the property alone provides a sufficient contact for a court having jurisdiction over that geographic area to adjudicate claims relating to the ownership of the property, or relating to injuries which occurred there. In that case, the jurisdiction exercised by the court is referred to as \"in rem\" jurisdiction (i.e. jurisdiction over the thing), instead of \"in personam\" jurisdiction.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has enacted legislation which declares internet domain names to be property for the purposes of such jurisdiction. Therefore, when a webpage infringes a trademark, the owner of the trademark can sue in \"any\" jurisdiction where the webpage can be viewed – but only for the remedy of transferring ownership of the webpage to the trademark-holder.\n\n The word \"\"haled\"\" means to summon or compel a person to respond in court.\n"}

His father, Mustafa Dede, was the Sheik of the Suhreverdi, a group that had migrated to Amasya from Central Asia.\n\nIn Amasya, he studied the six scripts under the tutelage of Hayreddin Mar'asi. He learned the traditional method of the old masters, but struggled to reproduce it. While studying, he met Bâyezïd, the son of Sultan Mehmed, the Conqueror who was a fellow student, and the pair became friends. When Bâyezïd assumed the throne in 1481, following his father's death, he invited his friend, Sheikh Hamdullah, to the capital, Istanbul. Hamdullah went on to become a master calligrapher at the Imperial Palace.\n\nIn 1485, Bâyezïd II acquired seven works by the great calligrapher, Yaqut al-Musta'simi. Bâyezïd then encouraged his court calligrapher, Hamdullah, to devise a new script, inspired by the acquisition. Hamdullah regarded al-Musta'simi's work as unsurpassable, but at Bâyezïd's insistence, Hamdullah reluctantly agreed. Scholars have suggested that Bâyezïd's enthusiasm for a new script was symbolic of his desire to establish a new empire and a new dynasty.\n\nHamdullah underwent a period of reclusion during which time he claimed that a prophet taught him the new scripts in a vision. He ultimately recodified and refined the \"nashk\" style of calligraphy, originally developed by Yaqut al-Musta'simi. Hamdullah's scripts were more elegant, balanced and legible. From 1500, the majority of Q'rans adopted Hamdallah's new style, which became known as the \"Ottoman style\" or \"Seyh's manner'. For this, he is often considered to be the \"father of Ottoman calligraphy\". His many students spread his style throughout the Ottoman Empire. His style endured for 150 years, making him one of the greatest Ottoman calligraphers of all time. As much as two centuries later, students of calligraphy such as Hâfiz Osman continued to copy his works assiduously as part of their training.\n\nHe devoted his whole life to the art of calligraphy, continuing to produce works well into his 80s. He produced 47 Mus'hafs, book of Quran, and innumerable En'ams, Evrads and Juz', a number of which are held in the collection of the Topkapi Palace. His inscriptions also decorate the Bâyezïd, Firuzaga and Davud Mosques in Istanbul and the Bâyezïd Mosque in Erdine.\n\nHis son, Mawlana Dede Chalabi, became a calligrapher after studying with Hamdallah (his father) and Hamdallah's daughter, whose name is unknown, married a calligrapher by the name of Shukrullah Halife of Amasya, who had also been one of her father's pupils. Hamdullah's grandsons also became calligraphers; Pir Muhammad Dede (d. 986/1580, son of Hamdallah's daughter) and Dervish Muhammad (d. 888/1483, son of Mawlana Dede).\n\nAs his reputation grew, many myths to his abilities outside calligraphy sprang up. It was said that he was a great archer, falconer, swimmer and even an extraordinary tailor.\n\nHe died in Istanbul in 1520 and was buried at Karacaahmet Cemetery in the district of Üsküdar at Istanbul. Surviving examples of his works are held in the Topkapi Collection.\n\nBiographical dictionaries outlining the lineages of calligraphers emerged as a small, but important literary genre in the 16th and 17th-centuries. In these works, a tradition of tracing an unbroken line of master-pupil relationships back to Sheikh Hamdullah, the man who was seen as the father of Ottoman calligraphy, is evident. These 'genealogies' continue to be published into the present.\n\nExamples of these calligraphic genealogies include:\n\n"}

It may be the first instance of the familiar \"50s progression\" in a popular song and has become a standard ballad. The song was a hit twice in 1949 with successful recordings in the U.S. by Billy Eckstine and Mel Tormé. In 1961, \"Blue Moon\" became an international number-one hit for the doo-wop group The Marcels, on the \"Billboard\" 100 chart and in the UK Singles chart. Over the years, \"Blue Moon\" has been covered by various artists, including versions by Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, The Platters, The Mavericks, Dean Martin, Yvonne De Carlo, for Masterseal Records 1957, The Supremes, Cyndi Lauper, Bob Dylan and Rod Stewart. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album \"On the Happy Side\" (1962). Cowboy Junkies recorded the song on their album \"The Trinity Sessions\". It is also the anthem of English Football League club Crewe Alexandra and English Premier League football club Manchester City, who have both adapted the song slightly.\n\nRodgers and Hart were contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in May 1933. They were soon commissioned to write the songs for \"Hollywood Party\", a film that was to star many of the studio's top artists. Rodgers recalled, \"One of our ideas was to include a scene in which Jean Harlow is shown as an innocent young girl saying—or rather singing—her prayers. How the sequence fitted into the movie I haven't the foggiest notion, but the purpose was to express Harlow's overwhelming ambition to become a movie star ('Oh Lord, if you're not busy up there,/I ask for help with a prayer/So please don't give me the air ...').\" The song was not recorded (the movie was released without Harlow in 1934) and MGM Song \"Prayer (Oh Lord, make me a movie star)\" dated June 14, 1933, was registered for copyright as an unpublished work on July 10, 1933.\n\nHart wrote new lyrics for the tune to create a title song for the 1934 film \"Manhattan Melodrama\": \"Act One:/You gulp your coffee and run;/Into the subway you crowd./Don't breathe, it isn't allowed\". The song, which was also titled \"It's Just That Kind of Play\", was cut from the film before release, and registered for copyright as an unpublished work on March 30, 1934. The studio then asked for a nightclub number for the film. Rodgers still liked the melody so Hart wrote a third lyric: \"The Bad in Every Man\" (\"Oh, Lord ... /I could be good to a lover,/But then I always discover/The bad in ev'ry man\"), which was sung by Shirley Ross.\n\nAfter the film was released by MGM, Jack Robbins—the head of the studio's publishing company—decided that the tune was suited to commercial release but needed more romantic lyrics and a punchier title. Hart was initially reluctant to write yet another lyric but he was persuaded. Robbins licensed the song to \"Hollywood Hotel\", a radio program that used it as the theme. The cover of Robbins' 1934 sheet music edition credits Ted Fio Rito (vocal by Muzzy Marcellino) as introducing the song, recorded on Brunswick 7315, October 19, 1934. The song charted in the Top Ten for 18 weeks in \"Variety\", reaching number 1 on January 26, 1935. The song was also recorded by Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra for Decca Records in November 1934 and Connee Boswell for Brunswick Records in 1935. It subsequently was featured in at least seven MGM films, including the Marx Brothers' \"At the Circus\" (1939) and \"Viva Las Vegas\" (1964). There are two introductory verses in the original Robbins sheet music edition. Eric Clapton and Rod Stewart sang the first verse in their 2004 version of the song (\"\"). The last line of the first verse is: \"Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men.\"\n\nOn September 16, 2018, a \"New York Times\" article disclosed that Liz Roman Gallese, a documentary filmmaker, has provided evidence on her website of a 1936 lawsuit contending \"Blue Moon\" was written by her late father, Edward W. Roman. The family story was \"that her father had sold the song for $900 to buy a car, or maybe that he had 'settled' with the rich and famous Rodgers and Hart for that amount.\" Ted Chapin, the chief creative officer of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, said that he had not heard of Gallese's story and that it seemed “a little far-fetched. ”\n\nAmerican swing era singer Billy Eckstine did a cover version of \"Blue Moon\" that reached the \"Billboard\" charts in 1949. It was released by MGM Records as catalog number 10311. It first reached the Juke Box chart on March 5, 1949, and lasted three weeks on the chart, peaking at number 21.\n\nAmerican jazz singer Mel Tormé did a cover version of \"Blue Moon\" that reached the \"Billboard\" charts in 1949. It was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 15428. It first reached the Best Seller chart on April 8, 1949, and lasted five weeks on the chart, peaking at number 20. The record was a two-sided hit, as the flip side, \"Again\", also charted.\n\nAmerican jazz singer Billie Holiday recorded a cover of \"Blue Moon\" in her 1952 album \"Billie Holiday Sings\".\n\n\"Blue Moons first crossover recording to rock and roll came from Elvis Presley in 1954, produced by Sam Phillips. His cover version of the song was included on his 1956 debut album \"Elvis Presley\", issued on RCA Records. Presley's remake of \"Blue Moon\" was coupled with \"Just Because\" as a single in August 1956. \"Blue Moon\" spent seventeen weeks on the \"Billboard\" Top 100, although it reached only .\n\nIn Jim Jarmusch's 1989 film \"Mystery Train\", the three distinct stories that make up the narrative are linked by a portion of Presley's version of \"Blue Moon\" (as heard on a radio broadcast) and a subsequent offscreen gunshot, which are heard once during each story, revealing that the three stories occur simultaneously in real time.\n\nThe Marcels, a doo-wop group, recorded the track for their album \"Blue Moon\". In 1961, the Marcels had three songs left to record and needed one more. Producer Stu Phillips did not like any of the other songs except one that had the same chord changes as \"Heart and Soul\" and \"Blue Moon\". He asked them if they knew either, and one knew \"Blue Moon\" and taught it to the others, though with the bridge or release (middle section – \"I heard somebody whisper ...\") wrong. The famous introduction to the song (\"bomp-baba-bomp\" and \"dip-da-dip\") was an excerpt of an original song that the group had in its act.\n\nThe record reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Pop chart for three weeks and number one on the R&B chart. It also peaked at on the UK Singles Chart. The Marcels' version of \"Blue Moon\" sold a million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It is featured in the \"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\". The Marcels doo-wop version is one of three different versions used in the 1981 film \"An American Werewolf in London\" with this version appearing at the end credits of the film. A version by Bobby Vinton plays during the film's opening titles while a version by Sam Cooke plays during the film's famous werewolf transformation scene. The Marcels' version of the song is referenced in the 1962 Academy Award-nominated animated short Disney musical film, \"A Symposium on Popular Songs\" during the song, \"Puppy Love Is Here to Stay\" written by Robert & Richard Sherman.\n\nAmerican country music group the Mavericks covered the song for the soundtrack of the 1995 film \"Apollo 13\". Their version peaked at number 57 on the \"RPM\" Country Tracks chart in Canada. It also charted on the \"RPM\" Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, peaking at number 15. A music video was produced, directed by Todd Hallowell.\n\nBritish singer Rod Stewart recorded the song with Eric Clapton for Stewart's 2004 album \"\". Their version was released as a single in early 2005 and peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart in the US.\n\n"}
{"id": "1826029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826029", "title": "Commote", "text": "Commote\n\nA commote (Welsh \"cwmwd\", sometimes spelt in older documents as \"cymwd\", plural \"cymydau\", less frequently \"cymydoedd\"), was a secular division of land in Medieval Wales. The word derives from the prefix \"cym-\" (\"together\", \"with\") and the noun \"bod\" (\"home, abode\"). The English word \"commote\" is derived from the Middle Welsh \"cymwt\".\n\nThe basic unit of land was the tref – a small village or settlement. In theory, 100 \"trefi\" made up a cantref (literally, \"one hundred settlements\"; plural: \"cantrefi\"), and half or a third of a \"cantref\" was a \"cymwd\", although in practice the actual numbers varied greatly. Together with the \"cantrefi\", commotes were the geographical divisions through which defence and justice were organised. In charge of a commote would be a chieftain probably related to the ruling Prince of the Kingdom. His court would have been situated in a special \"tref\", referred to as a \"maerdref\". Here, the bonded villagers who farmed the chieftain's estate lived, together with the court officials and servants. Commotes were further divided into \"maenorau\" or \"maenolydd\".\n\nThe \"Domesday Book\" has entries for those commotes that in 1086 were under Norman control, but still subject to Welsh law and custom. However, it refers to them using the Anglo-Norman word \"commot\" instead of hundred, the word used at the time for the equivalent land division in England. The commotes mentioned in the Domesday book, in general, represented recent Anglo-Norman advances into Welsh territory. Although the commotes were assessed for military service and taxation, their obligations were rated in carucate (derived from Latin for cattle or oxen), not in hides as on the English side of the border.\n\nThe customs of the commotes are described in the Domesday accounts of the border earldoms of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire. The principal commotes described in Domesday were Archenfield, Ewias, and the commotes of Gwent in the south; Cynllaith, Edeirnion, and Iâl (Shropshire accounts); and Englefield, Rhos and Rhufoniog (Cheshire accounts).\n\nIn legal usage, the English word 'commote' replaced \"cwmwd\" following the Edwardian conquest of Wales in the 13th century, when English was made the official language for all legal documents. The Welsh, most of whom knew not a word of English, naturally continued to use \"cwmwd\" and still do so today. In much of Wales, commotes had become more important than \"cantrefs\" by the mid-13th Century and administration of Welsh law became the responsibility of the commote court rather than the cantref court. Owain Glyndŵr called representatives from the commotes for his two parliaments during the rising of 1400–1409.\n\nThe boundaries of commotes, or in some cases cantrefi, were in many cases subsequently more accurately represented by church rural deaneries than by the hundreds issuing from the sixteenth century Acts of Union.\n\nA considerable number of the names of adjacent medieval Welsh commotes contain \"is\" (meaning \"lower\", or \"below\" as a preposition) and \"uwch\" (originally \"uch\" and meaning \"higher\", or \"above\" as a preposition), with the dividing line between them being a natural boundary, such as a river, mountain or forest. Melville Richards noted that, in almost every instance where this occurs, the point of central authority was in the \"\"is\" division\" when the commote was named, and he suggested that such commotes were originally named in the sense of 'nearer' and 'farther' based on the location of that central authority—\"i.e.\", the terminology is for administrative purposes and not a geographical characterisation.\n\nRichards attributed the use of \"is\" and \"uwch\" to some confusion in translating Latin \"sub\" (meaning \"lower\") and \"supra\" (meaning \"upper\") into Welsh in too literal a sense, when the proper sense was to consider \"sub\" to be an administrative synonym for Latin \"cis\" (meaning \"this side of\"), and to consider \"supra\" to be an administrative synonym for Latin \"trans\" (meaning \"the other side of\").\n\nA number of smaller units, such as manors, parishes and townships, also use the administrative distinction of \"is\" and \"uwch\", sometimes in their Latin forms (\"e.g.\", the manor of Clydach in Uwch Nyfer, divided into Sub Clydach and Ultra (Supra) Clydach).\n\nThis is unrelated to the common use of \"isaf\" and \"uchaf\" in farm names, where the terms are used in the geographical sense.\n\nThe Red Book of Hergest (1375–1425) provides a detailed list of commotes in the late 14th and early 15th century. The list has some overlaps and is ambiguous in parts, especially in the Gwynedd section. It should also be borne in mind that the number and organisation of the commotes was different in the earlier Middle Ages; some of the units and divisions listed here are late creations. The original orthography of the manuscript is given here together with the standard modern Welsh equivalents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.\n\nOver many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain lesions on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use. Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of procedural learning in human and nonhuman animals alike.\n\nCurrently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.\n\nThe comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills. Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.\n\nComparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition. Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with brain-damaged patients.\n\nWithin the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.\n\nComparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations. Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample. These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients. The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.\n\nGeorge Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career. Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys, and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate ablation. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist Colin Blakemore and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy. Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.\n\n\n"}

Much of the information about this dynasty comes from bardic legends of little historical value, and therefore, the reconstruction of their history is difficult. According to the bardic tradition, the dynasty's founder Anangapal Tuar (that is Anangapala I Tomara) founded Delhi in 736 CE. However, the authenticity of this claim is doubtful. The bardic legends also state that the last Tomara king (also named Anangapal) passed on the throne of Delhi to his son-in-law Prithviraj Chauhan. This claim is also inaccurate: historical evidence shows that Prithviraj inherited Delhi from his father Someshvara. According to the Bijolia inscription of Someshvara, his brother Vigraharaja IV had captured Dhillika (Delhi) and Ashika (Hansi); he probably defeated a Tomara ruler.\n\nAnangpal's grandson Kosal Dev Singh is said to have established Kosli in 1193 A.D.\n\nThe Tomaras of Gwalior ruled an area north of Gwalior known as the Tonwarghar tract.

Caputo as a sole-proprietorship. During the four years after its founding, NOW grew from a one-man operation to operating in 12 countries, and published almost 1,000 comic books.\n\nThe company was headquartered in the Chicago Loop in Chicago, Illinois. Most NOW titles were the results of licensing arrangements with such companies as Columbia (Sony) Pictures, Broadway Video, ELP Communications, CBS Entertainment, Inc., Speed Racer Enterprises, and Leisure Concepts, resulting in titles like \"Vector\", \"Mr. T & The T-Force\", \"Speed Racer\", \"The Original Astro Boy\", \"Alias\", \"\", \"The Real Ghostbusters\" and \"Ghostbusters II\", \"Fright Night\", \"Married... with Children\", and \"The Green Hornet\".\n\nNOW Library, NOW Video, and NOW Comics, started in late 1985 as a sole-proprietorship, with the first publications shipping in May 1986. The separate companies then became part of the Caputo Publishing, Inc. umbrella in 1987.\n\nIn a four-year period, CPI grew from a one-man operation with annual sales of $110,000, to an international multimillion-dollar corporation, with close to 100 full-time employees and freelancers, and the #3 position in comic book market share.\n\nDuring this period, CPI created such cross-promotional ventures as \"The Real Ghostbusters\" cereal (with Ralston Purina) and Slimer's Ecto-Cooler Hi-C drink (with Coca-Cola Foods).\n\nIn 1988, CPI purchased to rights to release the original \"Speed Racer\" anime on home video. Under the banner NOW Video, Caputo released 22 volumes of \"Speed Racer\" videos and three special gift sets. In 1989, NOW co-produced \"The What NOW Caper\", a sixty-minute comedy-documentary on comic book production.\n\nThat same year, however, the comics division began to lose steam, suffering from lack of focus and internal dissension. In 1990, NOW was forced to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy by Quebecor Printing and General Learning Corporation.\n\nIn 1991, NOW Comics relaunched as NOW Entertainment Corporation after being bought by General Learning. This new infusion of over $2 million in capital catapulted the company to number five in market share within its first quarter of business, and NOW Entertainment was nominated as best new publisher of 1991.\n\nIn 1994, the company ceased publishing after its \"January 1995\" releases, six months after founder Caputo left.\n\nIn 2003, Caputo returned, reviving the publisher as NOW Media Group, Inc. The new company, dubbed by Caputo as \"NOW Comics 3.0,\" was re-launched as a graphic novel \"self-publisher,\" giving creators a partnership role in the business. The business plan didn't pan out and NOW Media Group, Inc. folded in 2005, with the corporation fully dissolved in February 2006.\n\nDuring its operation, NOW acquired the talents of such industry veterans as Harlan Ellison, Neal Adams, Jim Steranko, Bill Sienkiewicz, Mike Baron, Jeff Butler, Dave Dorman, and Chuck Dixon. Alex Ross did his first professional comics work with the company (in \"\"), and Clint McElroy wrote several comics with NOW in the early 1990s.

{"id": "1826066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826066", "title": "Ampeg", "text": "Ampeg\n\nAmpeg is a manufacturer best known for its bass amplifiers. Originally established in 1946 in Linden, New Jersey by Everitt Hull and Stanley Michaels as \"Michaels-Hull Electronic Labs,\" today Ampeg is part of the Yamaha Guitar Group. Although specializing in the production of bass amplifiers, Ampeg has previously manufactured guitar amplifiers and pickups and instruments including double basses, bass guitars, and electric guitars.\n\nEverett Hull (born Charles Everitt Hull), a pianist and bassist working with bandleader Lawrence Welk in Chicago, had invented a pickup for upright bass in an effort to amplify his instrument with more clarity. Hull's design placed a transducer atop a support peg inside the body of his instrument, inspiring his wife Gertrude to name the invention the \"Ampeg,\" an abbreviated version of \"amplified peg.\" On February 6, 1946, Hull filed a patent application for his \"sound amplifying means for stringed musical instruments of the violin family,\" for which was awarded the following year. The Hulls relocated to New Jersey, and Everett met electrical engineer and amp technician Stanley Michael, who was selling a bass amplifier of his own design, soon renamed the Michael-Hull Bassamp. In 1946, they established Michael-Hull Electronic Labs in Newark, New Jersey, to sell their two products. Michael left the company in 1948, leaving it to Hull, who relocated the company the following year to 42nd Street in Manhattan, above the New Amsterdam Theatre, renaming it \"The Ampeg Bassamp Company.\"\n\nMichael-Hull advertised in \"DownBeat\" magazine, listing bassists like Chubby Jackson and Johnny Frigo as endorsers. Additionally, Eddie Safranski signed on with Michael-Hull to promote Ampeg products, receiving a royalty payment for equipment sold by their influence. After Michael's departure, Hull continued to leverage connections with well-known musicians to increase awareness of his products within the New York jazz community; Ampeg's new location between Carnegie Hall, NBC Studios in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and the Paramount Theatre helped establish relationships with bassists like Oscar Pettiford, Joe Comfort, Amos Milburn and Don Bagley.\n\nIn 1955, local musician and electrician Jess Oliver visited Ampeg's offices to purchase an amplified peg, and upon easily making the installation himself, Hull offered him a job. Oliver didn't join Ampeg on a full-time basis until 1956, the same year that Ampeg's name was simplified to \"The Ampeg Company.\" In 1959, the company was incorporated as \"The Ampeg Company, Inc.,\" with Everett Hull as President, Gertrude Hull as Secretary, and Jess Oliver as Vice President.\n\nIn 1960, Ampeg introduced the B-15, a bass combo amplifier with an innovative flip-top function, invented and patented by Oliver. The B-15 was the first in the company's Portaflex series, and after becoming the preferred studio amp of session musicians like James Jamerson and Chuck Rainey. The B-15 and its subsequent variants went on to become the most-recorded bass amplifier in history. By 1963, the Portaflex series business had grown to 44% of Ampeg's amplifier sales. In 1962, Ampeg introduced the plastic-bodied Baby Bass, a compact upright electric bass created from the Zorko bass, whose design Ampeg had acquired from the Dopera brothers, along with a unique Oliver-designed, Ampeg-patented pickup.\n\nIn 1962, Ampeg and its 40 employees moved to a new manufacturing facility in Linden, New Jersey. At 8,000 square feet, it was three times larger than their previous home. In June of the following year, after continued struggles to meet production demands and maintain cash flow, Ampeg announced an initial stock offering and became a publicly held company. By 1964, Ampeg had 100 employees and needed more space, relocating to a larger space one block away.\n\nThe combination of the rising popularity of rock and roll and the shift of bassists from upright bass to electric bass guitar during this time posed a challenge to Ampeg’s core business. The company's ads continued to feature prominent classical, jazz, and country artists, but with a notable absence of rock artists, and Hull strove to minimize rock musician visits to Ampeg's facilities. Hull's distaste for rock and roll music was further compounded by the success of Ampeg's chief competitor, Fender, as they continually bested Ampeg in overall sales. Through the 1960s, Ampeg amplifiers were designed for \"clean, undistorted sound\", with Hull saying \"we will never make anything for rock 'n' roll\".\n\nThe company continued to experience growing pains – by October 1966, with 200 employees and 40,000 square feet of space, Ampeg's production capacity had increased to $350,000 per month, yet had $3.5 million in unfulfilled backorders. Amidst company struggles related to growth and manufacturing, as well as disagreements with Hull, Oliver resigned from Ampeg. Hull began to seek potential buyers for the company.\n\nIn September 1967, Ampeg became a subsidiary of Unimusic Inc. when the newly formed investor group acquired a majority share of Ampeg stock. Unimusic consisted of investors interested in capitalizing on opportunities in the highly fragmented music equipment market of the time, not unlike CBS (which owned Fender and Rhodes), or later Norlin (which owned Gibson Guitars, Lowrey and Moog Music). While Hull was retained as President of Ampeg, Unimusic had purchased the company with the intention of using as a starting point for change. After a year of conflict between Hull and Unimusic, Hull tendered his resignation on October 3, 1968. Unimusic introduced a redesigned Ampeg logo and a new series of advertisements targeted at the rock market. In an effort to establish an Ampeg presence in key music markets, Ampeg opened regional offices: in Chicago; in Nashville near the Ryman Auditorium; and in the Hollywood Palladium in Hollywood.\n\nAmpeg chief engineer Bill Hughes and Roger Cox, with input from Bob Rufkahr and Dan Armstrong (a New York session guitarist and guitar expert hired as a consultant), were developing what Cox envisioned as the “biggest, nastiest bass amplifier the world had ever seen.” The Rolling Stones anticipated using Hiwatt DR-103 amps, as during their 1969 Hyde Park gig, which they brought from England. Their road manager, Ian Stewart, contacted Rich Mandella at the Ampeg office in Hollywood, and Rich arranged for the band to use five prototype amplifier heads of this new high-output model. These employed a 14-tube design to generate 300 watts of power in an era when most tube amps generated less than 100. The Rolling Stones took these prototypes and Manella on tour, playing all guitars and basses through them for the entire tour. After the tour, Ampeg put the design into production as the SVT, introducing it at the NAMM Show in 1969.\n\nAfter Armstrong and his amp tech Tom Duffy began modifying B-25 bass heads for rock guitar, the design team responsible for the SVT created the V series, introducing the V-3, V-2 and V-4 heads, VT-22 and VT-40 combos in 1970. The V-2, V-4 and V-22 were adopted by high-profile guitarists like Ron Wood and Keith Richards; both would use Ampeg SVT heads and cabs until 1981, when they replaced the SVTs with Mesa Boogie Mark I and Coliseum 300 amps.\n\nArmstrong designed a transparent plastic guitar and bass for Ampeg. The guitar was used by Keith Richards with The Rolling Stones during the same 1969, 1970, and 1971 tours and some early shows of the 1972 tour, and the bass version by Bill Wyman on the 1972 tour and some of the 1973 Winter tour shows. In 1971, citing lack of compensation for his contributions to the V-series amplifiers, Armstrong left Ampeg, and refused to renew the agreement allowing manufacture his guitar and bass.\n\nIn 1971, Ampeg was acquired by Magnavox, which owned musical instrument manufacturer Selmer, but was better known for televisions, radios and hi-fi components. The following year, Magnavox dissolved Ampeg’s incorporation and moved Ampeg’s management to the Selmer-Magnavox offices in Elkhart, Indiana. In 1974, amidst economic struggles and production capacity surpluses, Magnavox closed Ampeg’s Linden plant, moving production to a portion of a Magnavox electronics factory there. In 1978, SVT designer Bill Hughes left the company.\n\nIn 1980, Ampeg was acquired by Music Technology, Inc. (MTI), a wholesaler specializing in amplifiers from Japan and keyboards from Italy looking to expand. Under MTI management, SVT and V series amps were prototyped for production in Japan (though V series were never produced). MTI also introduced five new solid-state amps and six new tube amps for Ampeg, and a series of effects pedals. But after production issues and substandard sales, MTI declared bankruptcy a few years later.\n\nIn 1986, St. Louis Music (SLM) acquired the assets of Ampeg, including the rights to the name and all remaining MTI inventory. SLM converted leftover V5 heads into SVT-100s and set out to re-create the SVT, setting aside a room at SLM Electronics for an intensive development project. Working from original SVT drawings and parts purchase orders from 1969, the team created a run of 500 amplifiers in 1987 dubbed the Limited Edition SVT-HD amps. SLM then re-established Ampeg manufacturing in its Borman Avenue factory in St. Louis, introducing fourteen new Ampeg guitar and bass amps and the world’s largest bass amplifier at the 1987 summer NAMM Show.\n\nIn 2005, LOUD Technologies Inc. purchased St. Louis Music and its brands, including Ampeg and Crate amplifiers, ending their production at the Yellville, Arkansas facility in March 2007, outsourcing amplifier manufacture to contract manufacturers in Asia.\n\nIn May 2018, the Ampeg brand was acquired from LOUD Technologies by Yamaha Guitar Group, Inc.\n\nThe current Ampeg company is mainly known in the field of bass amps. They also have a line of guitar amplifiers and a remake of the Dan Armstrong guitar and bass.\n\nAmpeg holds six U.S. patents under the Ampeg brand name.\n\nIn the late-1950s Jess Oliver invented a combo amplifier with a chassis that could be inverted and tucked inside the speaker enclosure to protect the vacuum tubes. This combo bass amp was introduced in 1960 as the Portaflex, and remained a popular choice through the 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, Ampeg became the first company to incorporate reverberation (reverb) in an amplifier with its Reverberocket, which preceded Fender's Vibroverb amp by nearly two years. Despite Hull's distaste for rock and roll and resistance to distortion, the Reverberocket employed 6V6 -type power tubes which sounded \"Fendery\" and did break up in a way that rock and roll players could use.\n\nDuring the 1960s Ampeg only produced fairly low wattage combo amplifiers. Rock concerts were becoming increasingly large affairs and bigger amplifiers were needed. In 1969, Ampeg's Chief Engineer Bill Hughes designed the Super Valve Technology circuitry for the amplifier of the same name. At , the Ampeg SVT provided 300 watts of RMS power, considerably more than most other bass amplifiers of the era. The high power rating made the SVT a candidate for use in larger venues. The SVT saw widespread use by rock acts in the 1970s and is still considered by many to be the world standard reference bass amp. The SVT-VR (Vintage Reissue) is almost identical in design and construction and the closest thing to any of the original SVT models produced by Ampeg.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, SLM issued several guitar amplifiers under the Ampeg name. Some of these, the \"Diamond Blue Series,\" used the names of vintage Ampeg models (such as Jet and Reverberocket) and featured the bluish-colored diamond-checkerboard covering associated with Ampeg amps of the 1960s. The circuit designs of these amplifiers, however, were new. The Portaflex bass amp was reissued, with updates intended to make it more appealing to modern bass players.\n\nThe Ampeg GVT series, introduced around 2010, is a series of tube amplifiers built in South Korea, employing the Baxandall tone circuit.\n\nAmpeg also manufactured (or had manufactured for them) lines of quirky but distinctive instruments to complement their amplifiers.\n\nBaby Bass, introduced around 1962, was an electric upright bass with a full-size wooden neck and a cello-sized Uvex plastic body. The design was purchased from Zorko, re-engineered by Jess Oliver, and manufactured in a corner of Ampeg's Linden, New Jersey factory. It appeared in Ampeg's price list until about 1970, though popular only with bassists in Latin and salsa bands.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ampeg-branded guitars and basses were produced by Burns of London. These instruments did not sell well because import costs made them too expensive compared to Fenders and Gibsons. Baldwin's purchase of Burns in 1965 ended the association with Ampeg.\n\nIn 1966, Ampeg introduced their home-built line of long-scale \"Horizontal Basses\" (aka \"scroll\" or \"f-hole\" basses), both fretted and fretless (reputed to be the first production fretless electric bass). Some with different bodies were produced as the \"Devil Bass\" with distinctive horns, but the circuitry was identical. Originally using a transducer below the bridge, they were redesigned around 1968 to use a conventional magnetic pickup. At the same time, short-scale fretted and fretless basses, with magnetic pickups, were also produced.\n\nIn 1969, the Horizontal Basses were replaced by the Dan Armstrong-designed \"see-through\" guitars and basses, with bodies carved from colorless acrylic plastic. The transparent bodies contributed to long sustain but were heavy. The guitars incorporated slide-in user-changeable pickups, and the short-scale basses used two stacked coils with a \"pan\" pot for a wide range of tones. Production of the \"see-through\" instruments ended in 1971 when Armstrong left the company.\n\nIn 1971, Ampeg was acquired by Magnavox, which led to a distributorship deal with the Swedish guitar company, Hagström. In the 1975, Ampeg and Hagström collaborated to develop their first guitar/synthesizer hybrid using the contact of the strings on the frets as electric switches: In 1976 the Swede Patch 2000 was released, which required Ampeg Patch 2000 Pedals and an external synthesizer (Steiner-Parker Microcon was designed for it).\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Ampeg had a line of Japanese-made guitars and basses under the \"Stud\" name. The guitars included the Stud, Heavy Stud, and Super Stud, and the basses included the Big Stud and Little Stud. The Studs were knock-offs of popular Fender and Gibson instruments (although the Fender copies sported rather incongruous 3/3 and 2/2 guitar and bass headstocks). Some of the Stud instruments were poorly built (e.g. the plywood bodies and necks on the Little Stud), while others had good-quality features (e.g., gold-plated hardware on the Super Stud).\n\nAmpeg also produced effects pedals, including stand-alone reverb units in the 60s, the Scrambler (distortion) from 1969 (a resurgence in interest resulted in an updated Scrambler being reissued in 2005 along with Sub-Blaster (octaver) that produced a note one octave down), the Phazzer (phaser) from the mid- to late-70s, and a line of nine stomp boxes produced in Japan in the mid-80s.\n\nThere were also Ampeg branded accessories that included covers, picks, strings, straps, polish, as well as two practice amps, the Sound Cube and the Buster (a Pignose clone). Currently, Ampeg mostly offers covers, some outerwear, and a few other accessories with their logo.\n\nIn the mid- to late-1990s, Ampeg reissued the Baby Bass, the Horizontal Bass, and the \"See-Through\" instruments, as well as wooden instruments based on the \"See-Through\" design.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1826071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826071", "title": "Hugo Schmeisser", "text": "Hugo Schmeisser\n\nHugo Schmeisser (24 September 1884 – 12 September 1953) was a German developer of 20th century infantry weapons.\n\nSchmeisser was born in Jena, Thuringia. His father, Louis Schmeisser (1848–1917), was one of the best-known weapons designers in Europe. The life and work of Hugo Schmeisser mostly took place in the weapons manufacturing city of Suhl, Thuringia.\n\nThe submachine guns of Theodor Bergmann are closely connected with its name recognition and weapons production in the time leading up to the First World War. Schmeisser also received his fundamental training in weapons technology at Bergmann, where 7.63 mm and 9 mm machine gun rounds were being researched. He remained in Suhl during World War I because of the crucial importance of his expertise in machine gun technology.\n\nManufacturing regulations in the Treaty of Versailles (June 28, 1919) forbade Germany from developing heavy machine guns, but permitted machine pistols or submachine guns as a suitable weapon for police. This signaled the end of a 30-year cooperation between the Schmeissers and Bergmann as production was licensed to foreign weapons manufacturers. Schmeisser decided to continue work in weapons development. Together with his brother Hans Schmeisser, he created the \" \"Industriewerk Auhammer Koch und Co\" \" (Industrial Auhammer Koch and Company) in Suhl. Being at the end of World War I, he saw little business, and encumbered by the Treaty of Versailles, the future of the company was unclear. Schmeisser defied the treaty, working to continue development of automatic weapons. It was at this time that the company began cooperating with: C. G. Haenel Waffen- u. Fahrradfabrik Suhl (page in German at German WIKI), beginning a 20-year partnership. For the safety of his patents, Schmeisser created a second company under the name of \"Brothers Schmeisser\" in the summer of 1922. This shrewd tactic was to prevent the loss of his patents if Auhammer went bankrupt. In order to prevent bankruptcy on both sides, Auhammer and Haenel merged, with Haenel taking full responsibility and liability for Auhammer business affairs. Schmeisser's attorneys who settled the deal became active shareholders in the company. Before long, it was obvious that development of many types of automatic weapons was unaffected or even accelerated by the Treaty of Versailles. In the 1920s Schmeisser developed the MP28, which was used extensively by the German police. Bayard signed an agreement with Schmeisser to manufacture and sell weapons to South Africa and Spain, among other countries. It is notable that these same weapons were used during the Spanish Civil War only 10 years later. Despite Schmeisser's success, the company often came within inches of bankruptcy.\n\nAs the Nazis rose to power during 1933, ten weapons development enterprises in Suhl and Zella-Mehlis merged under the name of \"United Suhl-Zella Mehlis Armament Makers\". This central administration was used to coordinate production with the army's needs. This allowed Schmeisser to make a very important business acquaintance, which later developed to a friendship, with the aviator Ernst Udet, a deputy of Hermann Göring under Germany's \"Luftwaffe\". Schmeisser had a direct role in military production decisions, often influencing the decisions of Adolf Hitler and Göring. After 1935 Haenel experienced an enormous upswing in weapon production. Against the desires of many engineers and technical designers, the Schmeisser brothers continued to enforce patent royalties and manage company funds.\n\nBerthold Geipel of Erma designed the MP 36 using Vollmer's EMP. The chief designer, Heinrich Vollmer, revised the basic construction of Erma MP-36 and developed from it the well-known German submachine guns of the Second World War, the MP-38 and the MP-40. 1.2 million pieces were manufactured for these weapons, and were among the first weapons to be manufactured with die cast parts, metal stamping, and a complete machine-assembly. This method revolutionized weapon production, allowing manufacture at an unprecedented speed. They became internationally known as \"Schmeisser MP\"s, mainly due to the use of the straight magazine he had patented.\n\nSchmeisser's most important work had been underway since 1938. This new automatic weapon, with a short cartridge 7.92 mm, allowed for smart usage of resources and high production. At first named the Mkb 42, it later received the designation of MP-43, and it became one of the first assault rifles. By 1943, 10,000 pieces had already been manufactured for the front. For a short time, Hitler stopped production, as he was mysteriously opposed to the new weapon. In 1944, after troop testing verified the new weapon's legitimacy, Hitler authorized mass production of the MP-43 as well as further research into a new MP-44. In April 1944 the new weapon received the designation of \"\"Sturmgewehr 44\"\" (\"Assault Rifle 44\"). The StG 44 was arguably Schmeisser's most important weapon development.\n\nOn 3 April 1945 American troops began to occupy the city of Suhl. Weapons manufacturing was completely prohibited during this time. Hugo Schmeisser and his brother Hans were interrogated for weeks by weapon expert teams of the American and British secret services. At the end of June 1945, American troops evacuated Suhl and all of Thuringia. One month later, the Red Army assumed control over the area, starting a civilian works project to manufacture weapons for the Soviet Union. By August 1945, the Red Army had created 50 StG 44s from existing assembly parts, and had begun inspecting their design. 10,785 sheets of technical designs were confiscated by the Soviets as part of their research.\n\nSchmeisser was one of 16 Germans for which a special department (no. 58) was created at factory number 74, later known as Izhmash. Schmeisser was appointed as one of the five designers of the group, together with Kurt Horn and Werner Gruner (both from Grossfuss) and Oscar Schink (from Gustloff), under the formal leadership of Karl Barnitzke (also from Gustloff). There is some evidence that Schmeisser was uncooperative with the Soviets because he received the most negative review by his Soviet handlers in this group of five German designers. In these Soviet reviews, Schmeisser was described as a \"practical man\", whose lack of formal training showed whenever he was presented with any design problems.\n\nSchmeisser worked in Izhevsk until 1952 when he and other German specialists returned home to Germany. With short notice, his stay in the Soviet Union was extended beyond that of the other weapon specialists by a half year. He finally returned home on 9 June 1952. Schmeisser died on 12 September 1953, and was buried in Suhl. The 50th anniversary of his death was honored by a ceremony held in Suhl, as he is recognized as one of the most important technical designers of infantry weapons of the 20th century.\n\nSchmeisser had no role in the development of the MP-40 submachine gun despite its nickname \"Schmeisser\".\n\n\n"}

For four consecutive days, tornado outbreaks produced at least three significant (F2+) tornadoes each day, and at least two violent (F4–F5) tornadoes on three of the four days. The entire sequence generated 37 significant tornadoes, including at least nine violent tornadoes, one of which was rated F5. On May 5, two F4s struck Iowa, including a long-tracked tornado family that injured 11 people. On May 6, an outbreak of six strong tornadoes, four of them violent F4s, affected Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, and has been nicknamed \"The Longest Night\", killing 13 people and causing major damages—at the time the most damaging single weather event in Minnesota history. Three of the six tornadoes occurred on the ground simultaneously, and two of them hit the section of Minnesota State Highway 100 (now Interstate 694) and University Avenue in the city of Fridley. Both Fridley tornadoes damaged 1,100 homes and destroyed about 425; total losses reached $14.5 million, $5 million of which was to the Fridley school system.\n\nOn May 7, three significant tornadoes hit portions of the Upper Midwest, and beginning early on May 8, a major tornado outbreak affected the Great Plains states, particularly in Nebraska and South Dakota. The outbreak on May 8 produced numerous significant, long-lived tornadoes, including at least three violent tornadoes, two of which were actually long-tracked tornado families. A very large F5 tornado struck Tripp County in South Dakota, and two major F4s tracked across parts of Greeley and Antelope Counties in Nebraska. One of the F4s struck the small village of Primrose, almost totally destroying the settlement, causing possible F5 damage, and killing four people. Additionally, a high-end F3 obliterated a farm in Gregory County, South Dakota, and may have been an F4 as well. Many of the individual tornadoes on May 8 moved north and northwest, an unusual trajectory for supercells in this part of the Great Plains. Many of the long-tracked tornadoes on this date, rather than single tornadoes, were probably tornado families like the two long-lived F4s.\n\nTemperatures on May 6 were in the upper 70s °F with high dew points, which was considered to be unusual for early May in Minnesota. A strong low pressure area associated with an upper-level system moving in from the southwest and a nearby slow-moving cold front helped spark the storms. These storms formed as training supercells—an atmospheric phenomenon that is extremely rare in Minnesota. Because of the training, the same general areas from Sibley County through Carver and Hennepin and into northwestern Ramsey counties kept getting the brunt of these cells.\n\nTwo tornadoes touched down in Fridley, just over an hour apart. In all, six people were killed in the Fridley tornadoes and over 180 were injured. Over 450 homes were destroyed in Fridley, and neighboring Mounds View also sustained heavy damage. A man who called WCCO radio after the first Fridley tornado claimed on air that he had been in his car when the tornado hit and that the tornado blew out his car windows. Although he is widely believed to have been killed by the second Fridley twister later that night (which did kill a 26-year-old man with a similar name), the caller was actually a teacher at Fridley Junior High School who survived. The tornado also damaged the sign adorning the Heights Theater in Columbia Heights. In all, both Fridley tornadoes damaged 1,100 homes and destroyed about 425; total losses reached $14.5 million, $5 million of which was to the Fridley school system. Photographs for the earlier Deephaven and second Fridley tornado were published in the \"Minneapolis Tribune\" (now \"Star Tribune\") newspaper. Early radar images showed the supercells as they moved through the area.\n\nOn May 8th, an F5 tornado tore through the town of Gregory, South Dakota, and became the only tornado to be rated as such in South Dakota's history. On the ground for around 30 miles, the tornado reached a mile wide and destroyed 7 farms, 3 of which were swept away. Fortunately, the tornado resulted in no deaths.\n\nThe outbreak in Minnesota on May 6 was voted a tie by the Minnesota Climatology Office for the \"fifth most significant Minnesota Weather Event of the 20th Century\" with the 1965 Mississippi & Minnesota River Flooding. Considering this outbreak occurred just three weeks after the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, quick and successful warnings from the U.S. Weather Bureau and transmission from WCCO Radio kept the death toll relatively low. This was also the first time in Minnesota state history where civil defense sirens were used for severe weather purposes.\n\n"}

She began using her mother's bed as a makeshift vault, prompting her parents to enroll her for lessons at the CSS Farul Constanţa club. She progressed well in the sport and was accepted to train at the national training center in Deva in October 2002.\n\nLess than a year after beginning her training at Deva, in 2003, Munteanu became the Romanian national champion.

{"id": "1826077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826077", "title": "Forum selection clause", "text": "Forum selection clause\n\nA forum selection clause (sometimes called a dispute resolution clause, choice of court clause, jurisdiction clause or an arbitration clause, depending upon its form) in a contract with a conflict of laws element allows the parties to agree that any disputes relating to that contract will be resolved in a specific forum. They usually operate in conjunction with a choice of law clause which determines the proper law of the relevant contract.\n\nThere are three principal types of clause:\n\nA simple forum selection clause covering both the proper law of the contract and the forum for resolving disputes might read:\n\nWhen the clause chooses a particular jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes, it may do so either as an \"exclusive jurisdiction clause\" or a \"jurisdiction clause\". An exclusive jurisdiction clause mandates that all disputes must be resolved by a particular court, whereas jurisdiction confirms that a particular court may be used by the relevant parties, but does not preclude a party from commencing proceedings in another court if they wish to do so.\n\nIn many cross-border contracts, the forum for resolving disputes may not be the same as the country whose law governs the contract. The contract may provide for a staged procedure for resolving disputes. For example:\n\nThe choice of law stage in a conflict case requires the forum court to decide which of several competing laws should be applied to resolve the dispute. In this, there is an important distinction to be made between a forum selection clause and a choice of law clause. As an application of the public policy of freedom of contract, the parties are usually free to nominate the proper law under which all relevant disputes will be resolved. If there is an express selection, this choice will be respected so long as it is made bona fide, i.e. the subjective intention prevails unless the purpose is to:\nIf the parties do no more than nominate a forum, this is no more than an indication that they intend that forum's law to apply. There are many reasons why parties may select a forum (see a discussion of forum shopping):\nIf the parties have selected a jurisdiction as the place for the resolution of a dispute, the implication is that the courts may nevertheless apply their \"lex fori\" which includes their general choice of law principles. Thus, in the ordinary course of legal events, the forum court may identify and apply a \"foreign\" law as the \"proper law\". The majority of professionally drafted contracts will address both issues, and contain clauses specifying both the forum and the law to be applied therein. The fact that the particular contract only specifies the forum therefore becomes highly revealing as implying that the parties intended to leave the choice of law issue to the forum nominated.\n\nForum selection clauses have been criticised by a minority of courts as improper attempts to divest them of personal jurisdiction over the parties. Because of this, some jurisdictions refuse to give effect to these clauses, declaring them to be void as against public policy. However, most jurisdictions now recognise and enforce forum selection clauses, so long as the parties were acting in good faith.\n\nAlthough most contractual clauses are enforced by way of either an award of damages for breach or by an injunction to restrain breach, the operation of jurisdiction clauses tends to operate at the interlocutory stage of a dispute. The existence of a jurisdiction clause in an agreement will normally operate to enable a court to take jurisdiction in a particular matter, or may provide strong grounds for another court (not the chosen court) to decline jurisdiction.\n\nSuch clauses are sometimes enforced against proceedings in foreign courts by use of an anti-suit injunction.\n\nAlthough it is theoretically possible to sue for damages for bringing proceedings in breach of a jurisdiction clause, examples are rare.\n\nIn a complex agreement the forum selection clause will often be accompanied by a number of related clauses (either in the same contract or in a collateral document). These may include:\n\nDespite the general rule that if a contract is void each of the individual clauses in the contract are void, numerous legal systems, including English law, provide that jurisdiction and arbitration clauses are a special case, and that such clauses may still be relied upon even when it is part of the case of the person relying upon them that the contract is void.\n\nTypically a forum selection clause applies to all parties to the contract. However it is possible for a contract to state that if A wishes to sue B, then one procedure applies, and if B wishes to sue A, a different procedure applies. The legality of asymmetric clauses differs in various legal system. For example, they are generally enforceable under English law, but not under French law.\n\nSimilarly, one party may be afforded alternative dispute resolution options. For example, a loan agreement may provide that if the borrower wishes to bring proceedings against the lender, that can only be done by way of arbitration. But if the lender wishes to make a claim against the borrower they may do so by way of arbitration or by proceedings in a certain court. These are various called \"option clauses\", \"asymmetric clauses\" or \"hybrid clauses\".\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has upheld forum selection clauses on several occasions, and has suggested that they should generally be enforced. See \"The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Company\", 407 U.S. 1 (1972); \"Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute\", 499 U.S. 585 (1991). The \"Bremen\" and \"Carnival Cruise\" cases, however, arose under the Court's admiralty jurisdiction, not under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. \n\nA court in the United States will not necessarily honor a simple forum selection clause whereas it is likely to respect a clause that points to a specific forum with the express exclusion of others. Two October 2011 appellate rulings illustrate the difference. In \"Future Industries of America v. Advanced UV Light GmbH\", 10-3928, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City affirmed the dismissal of a case that sent the parties to Germany because the forum selection clause made German courts the exclusive forum. By contrast, the same court in \"Global Seafood Inc. v. Bantry Bay Mussels Ltd.\", 08-1358, affirmed the refusal of the lower court to refer the parties to Ireland because the clause was not exclusive, and the litigation continues in America. \n\nThe state of New York has a statute expressly dealing with those circumstances under which a New York court may not dismiss a case on the grounds of forum non conveniens if the parties' contract provides that the agreed upon venue is a court in New York and if the transaction involved an amount more than $1 million.\n\nCurrently, a U.S. Circuit Court split is emerging over whether forum selection clauses in a contract supersede pre-existing arbitration clauses in regulatory membership rules, such as FINRA.\n\nCorporate bylaws: Prior to 2010, it was uncommon for American corporations to insert forum selection clauses in their bylaws. But that situation changed. Surveying the case law in 2015, Bonnie Roe, Daniel Tabak, and Jonathan Hofer have argued (in \"Lexology\") that forum selection bylaws have become an established part of corporate governance in only a few short years. Their conclusion is that a board of directors adopting a forum selection bylaw \"can reasonably expect\" that the bylaw will be enforced. \n\nConsumer contracts: The enforceability of forum selection clauses in the consumer field is controversial. Many opponents of enforcement argue that the contracts that include such forum selection clause are contracts of \"adhesion\". This position is well summarized in an article in the \"Chicago-Kent Law Review\" by Marty Gould, who argues that, unlike most federal courts – which have enforced such clauses in the consumer context – a state court in Illinois correctly refused enforcement in connection with a claim relating to an online dating service contract. Proponents of enforceability take issue with the assertion of \"adhesion\".\n\nScope of a forum selection clause: Courts are often required to determine whether a forum clause covers all parties (including non-signatories) to a transaction. Many courts resolve the scope issue by applying the \"closely related\" test. See e.g. \"Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci America, Inc.\" and \"Roby v. Lloyd’s\". Writing in \"International Aspects of U.S. Litigation\", Eric Sherby argues that most courts that have addressed the issue have glossed over the circular nature of the finding of \"closely related\" and that even those few judicial decisions that evince an awareness of the circularity problem have themselves fallen into the circular reasoning trap.\n\nFranchise and dealership disputes: A number of American states have enacted statutes that require franchisors to agree to litigate disputes with franchisees in-state. Those states include California, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. Although not all of these statutes contain language of exclusivity, the case law has generally interpreted these statutes as invalidating contractual clauses that require disputes to be resolved out of the franchisee’s home state.\n\nIn 2005, the Hague Conference on Private International Law issued the Hague Choice of Court Convention. The Hague Convention does not apply to disputes involving consumers.\n"}

{"id": "1826081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826081", "title": "Tyrosinase", "text": "Tyrosinase\n\nTyrosinase is an oxidase that is the rate-limiting enzyme for controlling the production of melanin. The enzyme is mainly involved in two distinct reactions of melanin synthesis otherwise known as the Raper Mason pathway. Firstly, the hydroxylation of a monophenol and secondly, the conversion of an o-diphenol to the corresponding o-quinone. o-Quinone undergoes several reactions to eventually form melanin. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme present in plant and animal tissues that catalyzes the production of melanin and other pigments from tyrosine by oxidation. It is found inside melanosomes which are synthesised in the skin melanocytes. In humans, the tyrosinase enzyme is encoded by the \"TYR\" gene.\n\nA mutation in the tyrosinase gene resulting in impaired tyrosinase production leads to type I oculocutaneous albinism, a hereditary disorder that affects one in every 20,000 people.\n\nTyrosinase activity is very important. If uncontrolled during the synthesis of melanin, it results in increased melanin synthesis. Decreasing tyrosinase activity has been targeted for the betterment or prevention of conditions related to the hyperpigmentation of the skin, such as melasma and age spots.\n\nSeveral polyphenols, including flavonoids or stilbenoid, substrate analogues, free radical scavengers, and copper chelators, have been known to inhibit tyrosinase. Henceforth, the medical and cosmetic industries are focusing research on tyrosinase inhibitors to treat skin disorders.\nIn food industry, tyrosinase inhibition is desired as tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds found in fruits and vegetables into quinones, which gives an undesirable taste and color and also decreases the availability of certain essential amino acids as well as the digestibility of the products. As such, highly effective tyrosinase inhibitors are also needed in agriculture and the food industry.\nWell known tyrosinase inhibitors include kojic acid, tropolone, coumarins, vanillic acid, vanillin, and vanillic alcohol.\n\nTyrosinase has a wide range of functions in insects, including wound healing, sclerotization, melanin synthesis and parasite encapsulation. As a result, it is an important enzyme as it is the defensive mechanism of insects. Some insecticides are aimed to inhibit tyrosinase.\n\nTyrosinase carries out the oxidation of phenols such as tyrosine and dopamine using dioxygen (O). In the presence of catechol, benzoquinone is formed (see reaction below). Hydrogens removed from catechol combine with oxygen to form water.\n\nThe substrate specificity becomes dramatically restricted in mammalian tyrosinase which uses only L-form of tyrosine or DOPA as substrates, and has restricted requirement for L-DOPA as cofactor.\n\nTyrosinases have been isolated and studied from a wide variety of plant, animal, and fungal species. Tyrosinases from different species are diverse in terms of their structural properties, tissue distribution, and cellular location.\nNo common tyrosinase protein structure occurring across all species has been found. The enzymes found in plant, animal, and fungal tissue frequently differ with respect to their primary structure, size, glycosylation pattern, and activation characteristics. However, all tyrosinases have in common a binuclear, type 3 copper centre within their active sites. Here, two copper atoms are each coordinated with three histidine residues.\n\nHuman tyrosinase is a single membrane-spanning transmembrane protein. In humans, tyrosinase is sorted into melanosomes and the catalytically active domain of the protein resides within melanosomes. Only a small, enzymatically inessential part of the protein extends into the cytoplasm of the melanocyte.\n\nAs opposed to fungal tyrosinase, human tyrosinase is a membrane-bound glycoprotein and has 13% carbohydrate content.\n\nThe derived TYR allele (rs2733832) is associated with lighter skin pigmentation in human populations. It is most common in Europe, but is also found at lower, moderate frequencies in Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and among the San and Mbuti Pygmies.\n\nThe two copper atoms within the active site of tyrosinase enzymes interact with dioxygen to form a highly reactive chemical intermediate that then oxidizes the substrate. The activity of tyrosinase is similar to catechol oxidase, a related class of copper oxidase. Tyrosinases and catechol oxidases are collectively termed polyphenol oxidases.\n\nThe gene for tyrosinase is regulated by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).\n"}

It was the last to be co-represented by a member of the Conservative Party when it was dual-member, before the 1885 general election which followed the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 coupled with the Reform Act 1884. In 1919 the local MP, Josiah Wedgwood, shifted his allegiance from the Liberal Party — the Lloyd George Coalition Liberals allying with the Conservatives — to the Labour Party and the seat elected the Labour candidate who has stood at each election for the next hundred years, a total of 29 elections in succession. Labour came close to losing the seat in 1969, 1986, 2015 and 2017, and eventually lost the seat in 2019.\n\nIts 2017 general election result was the fifth-closest result, a winning margin of 30 votes. In 2019, it was subsequently won by the Conservatives for the first time since its creation, by over 7000 votes.\n\nFrom its creation in 1354, Newcastle-under-Lyme returned two MPs to the House of Commons. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the constituency's representation was cut to one member.\n\nJosiah Wedgwood of the pottery family was repeatedly elected to the seat from 1906 until he was ennobled to join the Lords in 1942, as 1st Baron Wedgwood and campaigned in the US for that country to join World War II and for Indian Independence; he was among many Liberals and their supporters deserting the party in or around 1918 due to the steering of David Lloyd George to the right and inviting Conservatives into government with him. Before the 20th century the constituency was often influenced and represented by members of the Leveson, Leveson-Gower and related Egerton family who owned in this constituency the Trentham estate - their most important MP was the Viscount Trentham who obtained a Dukedom.\n\nThis constituency had been a loyal Labour Party seat having returned a Labour MP in all 29 elections since 1918 and specifically since 1922 when MP Wedgwood defected from the highly centrist and compromising Liberal Party at the time to the Labour Party — his was among a great series of defections at this time see for example ex-Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's strong criticism of the Coalition Liberals particularly David Lloyd George. The 2015 result gave the seat the 9th-smallest majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority and 3rd-lowest in 2017. The Conservatives took six seats from Labour in 2017, and this seat was the second closest to being taken that was held, behind Dudley North, where the result was a Labour majority of 22 votes.\n\nIn 2015 one of four other parties' candidates standing, UKIP's Wood, won more than 5% of the vote in 2015 therefore keeping his deposit, the party which campaigned consistently for the public vote for leaving the European Union in 2016. In 2017 the three largest British parties fielded candidates only — Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates in order of votes won.\n\nTurnout has ranged from 87.6% in 1950 to 58.8% in 2001.\n\nThe constituency includes most of the northerly parts of Newcastle-under-Lyme borough, primarily Newcastle-under-Lyme town plus Keele and Audley.\n\nParliament accepted the Boundary Commission's Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies for General Election 2010 since which it has electoral wards, with no alterations in that review:\n\nFrom 1983-2010 the constituency comprised the following wards of the Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme, namely, Audley and Bignall End, Bradwell, Chesterton, Clayton, Cross Heath, Halmerend, Holditch, Keele, May Bank, Porthill, Seabridge, Silverdale, Thistleberry, Town, Westlands and Wolstanton.\n\nWhere the name of the member has not yet been ascertained or is not recorded in a surviving document, the entry \"unknown\" is entered in the table.\n\nAs there were sometimes significant gaps between Parliaments held in this period, the dates of first assembly and dissolution are given.\n\nThe Roman numerals after some names are those used in \"The House of Commons 1509-1558\" and \"The House of Commons 1558-1603\" to distinguish a member from another politician of the same name.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nBuckley resigned, causing a by-election.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

Since 1997, the seat has been seen as an important national bellwether.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, Nuneaton was the first key marginal seat between the Conservatives and Labour to declare its results. Instead of seeing the predicted victory for Labour, the seat saw a swing of 3.0% towards the Conservatives which proved to be a big indication that they were heading for victory in the 2015 general election, contrary to prior opinion poll projections.\n\n1885–1918: The Sessional Division of Coventry and part of the Sessional Divisions of Atherstone and Coleshill.\n\n1918–1945: The Municipal Borough of Nuneaton, the Urban District of Bulkington, and the Rural Districts of Atherstone, Coventry, Foleshill, and Nuneaton.\n\n1945–1955: The Municipal Borough of Nuneaton, the Urban District of Bedworth, and the Rural District of Atherstone.\n\n1955–1974: The Municipal Borough of Nuneaton, and the Urban District of Bedworth.\n\n1974–1983: The Municipal Borough of Nuneaton, and the Urban District of Bedworth as altered by the Coventry Order 1965.\n\n1983–2010: The Borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth wards of Abbey, Arbury, Attleborough, Bulkington, Camp Hill, Chilvers Coton, Galley Common, St Nicolas, Stockingford, Weddington, and Whitestone, and the Borough of Rugby wards of Earl Craven, Fosse, and Wolvey.\n\n2010–present: The Borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth wards of Abbey, Arbury, Attleborough, Bar Pool, Camp Hill, Galley Common, Kingswood, St Nicolas, Weddington, Wem Brook, and Whitestone, and the Borough of North Warwickshire wards of Arley and Whitacre, and Hartshill.\n\nThe boundary changes which took effect for the 1983 general election removed the town of Bedworth, which was transferred to the newly created North Warwickshire constituency. As a result, the sitting MP Les Huckfield declined to stand and unsuccessfully sought nomination in other constituencies such as Wigan and Sedgefield.\n\nThe constituency was created as a result of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, in an area whose population had expanded as coal miners poured in from other parts of the country. At one time 20 collieries operated in the area and now one of three major British coal mines continued with operations in the constituency at Daw Mill atop the Warwickshire Coalfield (known as the Warwickshire Thick) in the north of the county until 2012 when it closed. The associated heavy industry and mining-centred economy coupled with the Representation of the People Act 1918 (Fourth Reform Act) led to Nuneaton being held by the Labour Party for nearly 50 years until lost in the 1983 Conservative Landslide to Lewis Stevens, a Conservative who retained the seat in 1987.\n\nLabour regained the constituency at the 1992 election. Bill Olner beat Stevens and retained the seat in 1997, 2001 and 2005. Olner announced in 2007 that he would not be contesting the 2010 general election and would be standing down at the end of the 2005–2010 parliament. Former Nuneaton and Bedworth Council Leader Marcus Jones was successful in taking the seat for the Conservative Party at the 2010 election and retained the seat in 2015, 2017 and 2019.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, Nuneaton was the first marginal constituency between the Conservatives and Labour to declare its results. The result proved to be significant as it saw a 3.0% swing to the Conservatives, despite the seat being Labour's 38th biggest target and Labour being predicted to win the seat. The result therefore proved to be a major indication that the Conservatives were going to win a majority of seats in the House of Commons for the first time since the 1992 general election, something which went against national opinion polls which pointed towards Labour gains in the key marginal constituencies.\n\nIt was later reported that the moment incumbent Prime Minister David Cameron knew his Conservative Party had won the general election was when Nuneaton declared its results at 1.53 am on 8 May 2015.\n\nThis has led to many pointing out the similarities between Nuneaton and the former constituency of Basildon which in 1987 and 1992, Labour unexpectedly failed to win. This is why the Nuneaton result has been seen as the 'Basildon Moment' of 2015, since the Basildon constituency similarly foreshadowed the Conservative's election victory in 1992.\n\nNuneaton was chosen by the Labour Party as the host of their first televised leadership debate during their 2015 leadership election.\n\nGeneral Election 1939/40:\nAnother general election was required to take place before the end of 1940.

The boundary changes which took effect at the 1997 general election proved to be among the most controversial of all those proposed by the Boundary Commission. Initially only minor changes were to be made: two rural wards to transfer to Stone (newly created). However, in the same proposed boundary changes, the neighbouring community of Kidsgrove had been split between two constituencies, with two wards remaining in the constituency of Stoke-on-Trent North and two wards transferring to Newcastle-under-Lyme. At the local enquiry into the changes, it was argued that this division of Kidsgrove was unacceptable and the assistant commissioner consequently recommended that all four Kidsgrove wards be transferred instead to Staffordshire Moorlands. To make way for the 19,000 voters in Kidsgrove (to that date shown to be heavily Labour-supporting, two wards, Endon & Stanley and Brown Edge, were transferred to Stoke-on-Trent North, while two more rural wards were transferred to the Stone constituency. It was estimated that if the constituency had been fought on the pre-1997 Charlotte Atkins would have gained the seat by a majority of about 1,500 votes.\n\nThe boundary changes, which took effect at the 2010 general election, effectively reversed these changes: four of the five Kidsgrove wards transferred to Stoke-on-Trent North, with only one mainly rural ward, Newchapel, remaining in Staffordshire Moorlands. Brown Edge and Endon & Stanley returned to Staffordshire Moorlands. It was estimated that if the constituency had been fought at the 2005 election under the current boundaries, Labour would have lost the seat by 1,035 votes as opposed to the 2,438 votes that Charlotte Atkins won on that occasion.\n\n]]\n\nThe vote share change and hold status in 2010 comes from the notional, not actual, 2005 results because of boundary changes. Calculations of notional results (an estimate of how the seat would have voted in 2005 if it had existed then on the 2010 boundaries) suggested that the Conservatives would have won the seat, so the result in 2010 was classed as a Conservative \"hold\" by most sources.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

He has held many offices including Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister from 2013 until 2016, Chief Whip of the House of Commons from 2016 until 2017, Defence Secretary before he was dismissed. In July 2019, he was appointed as Education Secretary. \n\n1832–1868: The Hundreds of South Offlow, Seisdon and Cuttleston.\n\n1983–1997: The District of South Staffordshire.\n\n1997–2010: The District of South Staffordshire wards of Bilbrook, Brewood and Coven, Cheslyn Hay, Codsall North, Codsall South, Essington, Featherstone, Great Wyrley Landywood, Great Wyrley Town, Kinver, Lower Penn, Pattingham and Patshull, Perton Central, Perton Dippons, Shareshill, Swindon, Trysull and Seisdon, Wombourne North, Wombourne South East, and Wombourne South West.\n\n2010–present: The District of South Staffordshire wards of Bilbrook, Brewood and Coven, Cheslyn Hay North and Saredon, Cheslyn Hay South, Codsall North, Codsall South, Essington, Featherstone and Shareshill, Great Wyrley Landywood, Great Wyrley Town, Himley and Swindon, Huntington and Hatherton, Kinver, Pattingham and Patshull, Perton Dippons, Perton East, Perton Lakeside, Trysull and Seisdon, Wombourne North and Lower Penn, Wombourne South East, and Wombourne South West.\n\nThe constituency is made up of about two-thirds of the South Staffordshire local government district, its southern bulk. It flanks the western edge of the West Midlands, the closest parts being Wolverhampton and Dudley and it does not contain any large towns; the largest town (by electorate) is Wombourne. Its settlements include Brewood, Cheslyn Hay, Codsall, Featherstone, Great Wyrley, Kinver, Perton and Wombourne. Most electoral wards have to date been locally Conservative safe seats with Labour's only area of frequent strength, Cheslyn Hay, a town with historically a greater dependence on coal mining than the others.\n\nThe ancient county constituency of Staffordshire was divided under the Great Reform Act into two two-member constituencies, while other parts of the old constituency were made into or added to borough constituencies. These halves were formally the Northern division of Staffordshire and the Southern division of Staffordshire with less formal variations more common. The Reform Act 1867 abolished the Southern Division with effect from the 1868 general election, replacing it with two new two-seat constituencies: East Staffordshire and West Staffordshire.\n\nEdward Littleton was involved heavily in Catholic Emancipation, the Truck Act of 1831, the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 and the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and was for two years Chief Secretary for Ireland, prominent in the governments led by Melbourne.\n\nHenry Chetwynd-Talbot (later The Earl of Shrewsbury) became an Admiral and whip in the House of Lords in later in life. Most of this early period elected prominent landowning industrialists, including, for example in, Walsall, and Wolverhampton and Henry Hodgetts-Foley inherited the majority of Penkridge, now in the Stafford seat, much developed by his heirs.\n\nThe present South Staffordshire constituency was established in 1983, although in reality this was merely a renaming of the Staffordshire South West constituency formed in 1974 from parts of the former constituencies of Brierley Hill and Cannock. It covered the whole of the South Staffordshire district until 1997, when the area around Penkridge was included in the Stafford constituency.\n\nIt has to date been a safe seat for the Conservative Party, with Sir Patrick Cormack having held it from its creation in 1974 until he retired in 2010, when he was succeeded by Gavin Williamson.\n\nOn 30 April 2005, the Liberal Democrat candidate Josephine Harrison died of an undisclosed illness at the age of 53. Election procedures at the time required that in the event of a candidate's death after the close of nominations, the returning officer had to direct the general election poll (due to be held on 5 May) to be abandoned, and to call a fresh general election poll. This was duly done under the same writ of election, 28 days after having seen proof of death. As the poll was not strictly a by-election, but rather a part of the general election, it was run under general election regulations; for instance, not qualifying for the significantly higher election expenses available at by-elections.\n\nThe original candidates were:\n\nOn 9 May, the Labour candidate, Penny Barber, announced that she was standing down as she could not afford to take any more time off work. The constituency Labour Party had to select a new candidate, choosing Paul Kalinauckas who had been their candidate in the 2001 election. The Liberal Democrats selected Jo Crotty as their replacement candidate. In addition, three additional candidates who had not been nominated for the original poll fought the delayed election: Kate Spohrer of the Green Party, Rev. David Braid of Clause 28 Children's Protection Christian Democrats, and most notably the journalist Garry Bushell representing the English Democrats Party, who had already stood in the Greenwich and Woolwich constituency on 5 May, where he had polled 3.4%.\n\nThe election was eventually held on 23 June 2005 and saw Sir Patrick Cormack hold the seat. With the seat being safely Conservative, and with the results of the general election in other constituencies already known, the election attracted a considerably lower turnout (37.3%) than in other constituencies. Cormack increased his majority to 34.5% (a 9.1% swing), while the United Kingdom Independence Party saw one of their best results of 2005, with 10.4% of the vote.\n\nA year later. the Electoral Administration Act 2006 was passed in part because of the events in South Staffordshire.\nUnder the new rules, in case of the death of a candidate, the party of the dead candidate is allowed to select a replacement candidate. New nominations from parties which did not contest the original pool are no longer permitted. This rule was first used in the 2010 general election when the UKIP candidate for Thirsk and Malton died before the election.\n\nA \"Guardian\" statistical compilation by constituency in November 2012 showed that 2.8% of the population only were registered jobseekers, significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%.\n\nThe vote share change in 2010 comes from the notional, not actual, results because of boundary changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2003, she was an alternate to the Romanian team at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\n\nPractically unknown before 2004, she burst onto the international scene with a silver medal in the all-around final at the 2004 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Amsterdam. Her score in the all-around was 0.38 points behind that of the gold medalist, Alina Kozich of Ukraine, one of the narrowest margins of victory in European history. After three rotations (vault, uneven bars and balance beam), Kozich was 0.137 points behind Șofronie. However, in the last rotation, the floor exercise, Șofronie did not receive full credit for her dance connections, which lowered the start value of her routine to 9.70. At the same time, speculation was made that a Russian judge, Lyubov Adrianova, had influenced the elevation of Kozich's start value from 9.90 to 10. Despite this controversy, the European Union of Gymnastics and the International Federation of Gymnastics both affirmed the results of the competition. Șofronie also contributed to the Romanian team's gold-medal performance in Amsterdam, the first time since 1998 that they had taken this title. A picture of her performing at the championships was on the cover of the June/July 2004 issue of \"International Gymnast\".\n\nLater that year, she helped the Romanian team win the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. She competed on vault, bars and floor in the team final, scoring 9.400, 9.562 and 9.562, respectively. Individually, she won a silver medal on floor behind teammate Cătălina Ponor, placed fifth in the all-around final and sixth on uneven bars. Unusually for a Romanian gymnast, she was a strong bars worker and comparatively weak on beam.\n\nFollowing a subpar performance at the 2005 European Championships, Șofronie retired from the sport and pursued her education.\n\nAfter retiring from gymnastics, Șofronie graduated from high school and university.

The proposed seat would comprise the electoral wards of Bentilee and Ubberley, Boothen and Oak Hill, Broadway and Longton East, Eaton Park, Fenton East, Fenton West and Mount Pleasant, Hanley Park and Shelton, Hartshill and Basford, Joiner’s Square, Lightwood North and Normacot, Meir Hay, Meir North, Meir Park, Meir South, Penkhull and Stoke, Sandford Hill, Springfields and Trent Vale, and Weston Coyney.\n\nThe constituency was created for the 1950 general election. The large town had, in succession, two forerunners, the first of which gained representation by way of the \"Great Reform Act\" in 1832. The constituency has a majority of residents from a clear-cut working-class background, many of whom work or have worked in trade union-represented industries. Of these, many were employed in The Potteries, the smaller foundries or in nearby hubs for the civil infrastructure and automotive industries; the latter of these remains an important source of employment in the region. The constituency's housing—overwhelmingly low-rise, and in some cases highly ornate Victorian terraces and semi-detached houses—is, compared with Staffordshire as a whole, a relatively dense urban network of streets.\n\nStatistics are confusing as to the current status of the area, reflecting the great demographic—in particular, economic sector—changes in the constituency. Tristram Hunt's result at the 2015 general election gave the seat the 60th-most marginal majority of the Labour Party's 232 seats, measured by percentage of majority. Labour's continuous tenure of Stoke-on-Trent Central from 1950 to 2019 placed it among the approximately 120 constituencies of the 232 which returned Labour members in 2015—all their predecessor areas included—to have withstood landslides for the Conservative Party during the intervening period (such as the 1983 general election). Stoke-on-Trent Central ranked highest for political apathy at the 2015 election, recording the lowest turnout in the United Kingdom.\n\nBarnett Stross was awarded the Order of the White Lion in recognition of his role in the development of relations between the UK and Czechoslovakia, and for his role in the renewal of the substantial village of Lidice; he also led statutory efforts that began specific protection of workers against industrial disease.\n\nMark Fisher was for 13 months the Minister for the Arts at the outset of the Blair ministry.\n\nTristram Hunt was the Shadow Secretary of State for Education in the Labour Party's Shadow Cabinet from October 2013 until September 2015.\n\nVote changes are made with reference to the 2015 general election, not to the 2017 by-election.\n\n\n\n"}

Many towns and villages have a history of coal mining and heavy industry, linked to a strong Labour vote.\n\nSettlements include Bedworth, just north of Coventry, and the historic market town of Atherstone.\n\nThe constituency since 2010 has all but two wards of North Warwickshire.\n\n1832–1885: The Hundred of Hemlingford, the County of the City of Coventry, and the Rugby and Kirby Divisions of the Hundred of Knightlow.\n\n1983–2010: The Borough of North Warwickshire, and the Borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth wards of Exhall, Heath, Mount Pleasant, and Poplar.\n\n2010–present: The Borough of North Warwickshire wards of Atherstone Central, Atherstone North, Atherstone South and Mancetter, Baddesley and Grendon, Coleshill North, Coleshill South, Curdworth, Dordon, Fillongley, Hurley and Wood End, Kingsbury, Newton Regis and Warton, Polesworth East, Polesworth West, and Water Orton, and the Borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth wards of Bede, Exhall, Heath, Poplar, and Slough.\n\nThe North Warwickshire constituency was created for the 1832 general election, when the Great Reform Act divided the former Warwickshire constituency into two new divisions: North Warwickshire and South Warwickshire.\n\nUnder the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, North Warwickshire was abolished for the 1885 general election, when Warwickshire was divided into six new single-member constituencies: Rugby, Stratford-on-Avon, Nuneaton, Sutton Coldfield, Erdington and Tamworth.\n\nThe current North Warwickshire county constituency was created for the 1983 general election, replacing outlying parts of the Meriden and Nuneaton constituencies. The seat was won by Francis Maude of the Conservative Party at the 1983 general election, who held it until 1992, when it was taken by Mike O'Brien of Labour. Labour held the seat comfortably until 2010.\n\nOn 8 March 2007, former Army Officer and polar explorer Dan Byles was selected at an open primary to contest North Warwickshire for the Conservative Party. At the 2010 general election, Byles won the seat off Mike O'Brien by just 54 votes, making him the Conservative Member of Parliament with the smallest majority in the country. However, a strong Conservative performance during the latter part of the decade saw the seat become safer for the Conservatives.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n"}

It borders the Mid Worcestershire constituency to the east, and West Worcestershire to the west.\n\nA safe Conservative seat for many years (the Conservatives even narrowly held the seat in the 1945 Labour landslide), Worcester was represented by the high-profile Conservative cabinet minister Peter Walker for three decades, from a by-election in 1961 until he stood down in 1992. Peter Luff held the seat for the Conservatives until 1997, when he moved to the redrawn Mid Worcestershire constituency.\n\nMichael Foster of the Labour Party gained the seat at the 1997 general election. This can be put down to a combination of Labour's landslide victory nationally, but also to the fact that boundary changes meant the constituency was now solely an urban area; rather than also containing much of the surrounding countryside.\n\nPeter Walker's son, Robin Walker, was elected as the Conservative MP at the 2010 general election. The constituency is marginal and was selected as a \"target\" by the Labour Party in 1997, and by the Conservative Party in 2010.\n\nMany political commentators and journalists look on Worcester as having the demographic statistics which most closely mirror those in the United Kingdom as a whole. As such the term \"Worcester woman\" has come into use as a description for a typical swing voter.\n\n\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|First member!!Party!!colspan=\"2\"|Second member!!Party\n"}
{"id": "1826123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826123", "title": "Star Goose", "text": "Star Goose\n\nStar Goose (sometimes stylized as Stargoose) is a vertically scrolling shooter that was published for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS by Logotron in 1988. The player controls Scouser-Gitt, who pilots the eponymous Star Goose, a vessel that has been commissioned to scour the planet Nom and collect 48 crystals. Players must collect all six crystals in each of the game's eight levels to advance, while at the same time avoiding or destroying enemies and maintaining their shield, ammunition, and fuel levels. The game's surfaces are contoured, which affects the way that bullets travel, and contain tunnels that switch modes to a three-dimensional perspective where the player can replenish their resources.\n\nDeveloped by Steve Cain and Graham Everett, the original concept was a racing game based on the three-dimensional tunnel mode, but this idea was scrapped after the designers became unsatisfied with the results. Originally priced at £19.95, the game received mixed reviews for its Amiga release, and negative ones for the Atari ST version, with reviewers praising the graphics, but criticizing the lack of variety in the gameplay, its difficulty, and the audio. Re-releases in 1991 at budget prices were better received.\n\n\"Star Goose\" is a single-player vertically scrolling shooter where the player controls the character of Scouser-Gitt, a pilot who flies the eponymous Star Goose vessel. In the game's background story, Scouser-Gitt is an experienced, but disgraced fighter pilot who is recruited by a Tribal Elder to recover 48 crystals from the planet Nom by raiding the military's ammunition dumps. There are six crystals located on each of the game's eight levels, and the player must retrieve all of them to advance. To do so, they must either bypass or destroy the planet's defense systems, which include missile launchers, gun turrets, mines, and vessels piloted by enemy warriors.\n\n\"Star Goose\" begins with a mother ship dropping off Scouser-Gitt directly above the surface of the area in a Star Goose ship. Each level wraps-around, and thus the player returns to the start of the level once they have traveled through it and will do so again unless all six crystals have been collected. The player begins with four lives and receives an extra life with every 100,000 points. When the player runs out of lives, they have the option to restart the game on the level they were playing previously. The default weapon is a forward-facing gun, but the Star Goose is also equipped with a limited supply of missiles that can be fired from either side of the vehicle and destroy enemies on contact. These can be replenished at missile gates located in each level. Each level in the game constantly scrolls the screen upwards and contains contoured hills and valleys that the ship navigates automatically, but affect the direction of the player's bullets. Shots fired will only hit enemies when the ship is traveling at the same level; otherwise they go above or below their targets depending on whether the player is climbing a hill or descending into a valley.\n\nThe player must also keep track of three gauges: shields, ammunition, and fuel. The former decreases every time the Star Goose collides with an enemy or is hit by their fire, while the latter two are depleted with use. To replenish these metres, the player must enter a tunnel labelled with the resource that they wish to recover; these tunnels are spread across the level on the sides of hills. Upon entering a tunnel, the game switches to a three-dimensional perspective, viewing the Star Goose inside a circular space from behind. These areas contain hovering eyes that can be collected to replenish the gauge. The player can climb the sides of the tunnel, reach the ceiling, and travel in a loop, depending on their speed. If the Star Goose is upside down upon exiting the tunnel, however, it will crash and the player will lose a life. Similar tunnels in the ground at the start of each level serve as a means to connect each level and contain eyes that can be collected for points.\n\n\"Star Goose\" was developed by artist Steve Cain and programmer Graham Everett, who previously developed the platform game \"Black Lamp\" from Firebird Software. Cain also worked on the graphics for 1985's \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\" from Denton Designs. Everett intended \"Star Goose\" to be a first-person perspective racing game through the same tunnels that were used in the finished product. Everett claimed that he was \"inspired [...] by the kind of car race, often seen in movies, where the cars race around a basin-like track with curved sides.\" Unsatisfied with the result, the concept was modified into a shoot 'em up.\n\n\"Star Goose\" was published by Logotron for the Atari ST and Amiga computers in 1988 and was ported to MS-DOS at the end of the year. A Commodore 64 version was planned, but never released. The music and sound effects were ported from the Atari ST to the Amiga, which limited their impact. Depending on the system, the game can be played with the mouse, joystick, or keyboard. Logotron claimed that the graphics featured \"Full-Beef Scroll,\" meaning that it was meant to look an arcade screen with the graphics taking up the entire screen and the playing information placed directly in the game area, rather than having it at the edge of the screen.\n\n\"Star Goose\" received mixed reviews for its Amiga release. Reviewing the game for \"Amiga Computing\", Chris Holmes argued that the game was difficult and that once the player has learned to overcome this, \"the game becomes a touch monotonous as the action does not vary.\" He rated the game at 66%, docking points for the sound in particular. Steve Jarratt of \"Commodore User\" complained that in the Amiga version \"the gameplay fails to fulfil [\"sic\"] the promise of the graphics\" and gave it a 4 out of 10. The following month, the French gaming magazine \"Génération 4\" rated it at 45%, criticizing its similarity to other games in the genre and calling it a \"pale copy of Zaxxon\", although praising its graphics. Conversely, Richard Silsby of \"Australian Commodore and Amiga Review\", in the July 1989 issue, recommended the Amiga version due to its graphics and music. Tomas Hybner, in the October 1988 edition of the Swedish \"Datormagazin\", gave the game 3.75 out of 5 and called it \"original\", also highlighting its graphics.\n\nReviews for \"Star Goose\" on the Atari ST were more negative. Andy Wilton of \"ACE\", writing in October 1988, noted that \"[a] host of unusual features make it stand out\" but \"[o]riginality is no substitute for gameplay\", as well as the fact that the contouring element did not mesh will with the rest of the game. The publication's final assessment gave \"Star Goose\" 517 out of 1000 for the Atari ST version. That same month, Julian Rignall of \"The One\" gave it a similar rating of 51% and mentioned that \"compared with today's high standards it lacks the polish, playability and challenge of many similar priced games\". The assessment from October 1988's issue of Zzap!64 was even lower, highlighting the game's general presentation as positive, but criticizing the graphics and gameplay for a lack of variety and the sound for its lack of originality, with an overall rating of 37%. In November 1988, Matt Bielby of \"Computer and Video Games\" gave the game a 72%, but held the graphics and music in low esteem and referred to the game overall as one with good potential that \"botches the job\". In giving the game a 68% in November 1988, \"ST/Amiga Format\" praised its graphics, but criticized the gameplay and the audio, while \"ST Action\" scored it at 71% the same month.\n\n\"Star Goose\" was re-released by Prism Leisure Corporation in late 1991 for £2.99 and received more favourable reviews. Stuart Campbell, writing for \"Amiga Power\", gave the re-release an 82%, referring to it as \"limited\", but arguing that it was a good value for the price. Around that time it was also distributed by Pactronics' Budget Series, albeit for £12.95. \"Australian Commodore and Amiga Review\", which had recommended the game when it was first released, upheld its recommendation with a 77% for the re-release, praising the graphics and gameplay.\n"}

It was created by the division of the old Worcestershire constituency (which had existed since 1290) into two new two-member constituencies: West Worcestershire and East Worcestershire.\n\nDuring this first creation, three members of the Lygon family, the Earls Beauchamp (pronounced Beecham) represented the constituency - their large country estate in the county had its seat at Madresfield Court near the heart of Madresfield village.\n\nThe constituency then existed, basically unchanged, until its abolition by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election, when the constituency's territory was variously incorporated into the seats of Bewdley, Droitwich, Evesham, East Worcestershire and North Worcestershire.\n\nThe seat was created on Parliament's approval for the 1997 general election of the Boundary Commission's fourth periodic review (following the first such review in 1945, which in turn followed that of the Representation of the People Act 1918.\n\nIn the four elections to date the seat has alternated between Conservative majorities that were quite marginal (7.8% and 5.3%) and those that were greater than 10%, at 12% and 12.7%, close to average in terms of security for any of the three largest parties.

The constituency has periodically swung back and forth between the Labour and Conservative parties since the 1920s, and has been held since 2005 by a Conservative MP, Mark Pritchard.\n\nAnthony Trafford (Conservative) went on after serving as MP to serve as a health minister, from the House of Lords in 1989.\n\nGerald Fowler (Labour) reached the frontbenches of government as the Minister for Education and Science from 1969 to 1970, again in 1974 and 1976 and as Minister for the Privy Council Office from 1974 to 1976.\n\nBruce Grocott (Labour) went on, after serving as MP for the newly created neighbouring seat from 1997 to 2001, to serve as the Government's Chief Whip in the House of Lords for six years.\n\nThe seat saw a first winning candidate from the Labour Party relatively early in its history, in 1923. The seat alternated between the two largest modern parties eight times between 1923 and 1979.\n\nIn more recent history, reflecting the growing population of Telford and the rich iron smelting, railway and mining industries as major historic employers in the area, the seat was more Labour-leaning than the national average but still marginal, being represented by a Conservative for the first eight years of the Thatcher ministry and then (from 1987) returning a Labour member, who went on to serve a new seat created to serve Telford in 1997, and another Labour member until 2005, followed by the present Conservative who was elected that year.

This redefinition resulted in a quarter of the electorate being removed to Shropshire North and Ludlow.\n\nParliament approved major boundary changes which took effect at the 1997 general election, which created a new constituency containing and named after the town of Telford, before which Telford had been one of the largest elements of The Wrekin. The new Telford constituency took 62.9% of the electorate of The Wrekin leaving the remaining 37.1% to constitute a revised constituency of The Wrekin that incorporated areas previously within Shropshire North and Ludlow from two sides.\n\nThe area almost encircles Telford, a 'New Town', encompassing much of the rural parts of the Telford and Wrekin borough, in which most of the constituency is. Its major settlements include: Wellington, Newport and Shifnal, as well as the suburban northern reaches of Telford (including Donnington). A small but significant area relates to the former Bridgnorth local government district (now part of the unitary Shropshire) and contains RAF Cosford and a number of commuter villages along the M54 motorway: the civil parishes of Sheriffhales, Shifnal, Tong, Boscobel, Albrighton, Donington and Boningale make up the non-Telford and The Wrekin-administered portion. Boundary changes to realign the constituency boundaries to fit with the borough's most recent ward revisions resulted in the removal of Ketley (to the constituency of Telford) for the 2010 general election.\n\nFuture proposals: Under constituency boundary proposals announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, this constituency is proposed to lose the Donnington and Hadley and Leegomery wards to Telford constituency, while the remainder will be merged into a new seat called Bridgnorth, Wellington and the Wrekin.\n\nThe constituency is in the east of Shropshire, specifically, around The Wrekin hill and therefore in undulating country within fast road access (and some rail access) commuter's reach to the West Midlands, Stafford and Stoke on Trent.\n\nWorkless claimants, registered jobseekers, were in November 2012 lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 3.1% of the population based on a statistical compilation by \"The Guardian\".\n\n\"Note: although The Wrekin was a Labour-held seat in the previous Parliament, boundary changes removed many Labour-leaning areas that now fall in the neighbouring seat of Telford, which Bruce Grocott decided to contest in 1997 instead of the new Wrekin seat.

She was also a regular on the first season of \"Veronica Mars\". However, she left the show after only appearing in four episodes because of budget cuts.\n\nIn 2007, Poitier starred in \"Death Proof\", director Quentin Tarantino's segment of the movie \"Grindhouse\", as radio DJ Jungle Julia. The next year, she had a co-starring role in the new \"Knight Rider\" series, as FBI Agent Carrie Rivai.

In the recession of 2008–09, it was the first place in the UK where the claimant count rate of unemployment exceeded 10%, breaching that level in January 2009. In July 2008, Ladywood had the highest unemployment rate in the whole of the West Midlands (by the international standardised measure, which is usually higher than the claimant count) at just over 18%, compared with neighbouring Birmingham seats Perry Barr (8.1%), Sparkbrook and Small Heath (13.9%), and Yardley (7%). For the year ending September 2014, the unemployment rate was 12.4%, although the employment rate had increased only slightly, from 46.1% to 46.6% (compared with 69.7% for the West Midlands as a whole).\n\nThe average house price in Ladywood is just under £155,000; making it much lower than the national average of just over £288,000.\n\n2010–present: As 1997 but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n1997–2010: The City of Birmingham wards of Aston, Ladywood, Nechells, and Soho.\n\n1983–1997: The City of Birmingham wards of Ladywood, Sandwell, and Soho.\n\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Birmingham wards of All Saints', Ladywood, Rotton Park, and Soho.\n\n1955–1974: The County Borough of Birmingham wards of Duddeston, Ladywood, and St Paul's.\n\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Birmingham wards of All Saints', Ladywood, and Rotton Park.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Birmingham wards of Ladywood and Rotton Park.\n\nThe constituency includes the entirety of Birmingham City Centre (Ladywood ward), as well as Aston, Nechells and Soho which (based on the indices of Multiple Deprivation) are the city wards of highest deprivation. Aston University is within the seat, as are Birmingham's two league football clubs, Aston Villa and Birmingham City.\n\nThe constituency has undergone several boundary changes since its creation in 1918 but has remained a safe Labour seat since the Second World War, with the exception of a by-election in 1969 when Wallace Lawler won the seat for the Liberal Party and the immediately surrounding period when its majority was marginal. The seat was regained for Labour by Doris Fisher at the 1970 general election. The 2015 general election result made the seat the sixth-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nThe constituency's first MP was the future Conservative Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who transferred to the Edgbaston seat in 1929. The current MP is Shabana Mahmood, one of the UK's first three female Muslim MPs.\n\nThe first campaign for this constituency in 1918 was notable because the Liberal Party candidate was Mrs Margery Corbett Ashby, one of only seventeen women candidates to contest a parliamentary election at the first opportunity. Chamberlain reacted to this intervention by being one of the few male candidates to specifically target women voters; deploying his wife, issuing a special leaflet headed \"A word to the Ladies\" and holding two meetings in the afternoon.\n\n\n"}

Conservative Saqib Bhatti took over the position after the 2019 General Election.\n\nThe constituency is one of two covering the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. It covers the rural area, known as the Meriden Gap, between the West Midlands conurbation and Coventry, which contains villages such as Balsall Common, Hampton-in-Arden and Meriden itself, with some towns, particularly Castle Bromwich and Chelmsley Wood (a large area of 1960s council housing on the eastern edge of Birmingham, some of which since acquired privately under the right to buy others of which being remaining social housing), higher than average national income and affluent areas particular examples being Hockley Heath, Bentley Heath, Temple Balsall, Catherine-de-Barnes, Dorridge and Knowle. Incidence of home ownership in this area is high, as opposed to the rented sector.\n\nMeriden is the largest geographical constituency in the West Midlands metropolitan area. It was created for the 1955 general election.\n\nThe 1983 boundary changes and landslide electoral success of Margaret Thatcher that year transformed the constituency into a Conservative safe seat, with the Labour-leaning areas becoming part of the new Warwickshire North constituency (which was also won by the Conservatives). Iain Mills held this seat until he died in office in January 1997, with the seat remaining vacant until the dissolution of Parliament that March (and therefore no by-election being held). Caroline Spelman was victorious in the 1997 general election, though on that occasion only by a marginal majority, and has held the seat since, with the challenge from Labour becoming more distant.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1955 following a review of parliamentary seats in Warwickshire by the Boundary Commission appointed under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. The constituency's area was transferred from the neighbouring constituencies of Nuneaton and Sutton Coldfield.\n\nTamworth Rural District was abolished in 1965, with most of its area redistributed between the two neighbouring rural districts. Accordingly, this resulted in only a minor boundary change to the constituency in 1974.\n\nUntil 1983 the seat was a Labour-Conservative marginal, covering the coal mining areas of northern Warwickshire and the more affluent area near Solihull. It changed hands between the two parties several times, including in a by-election in 1968, which was won by Keith Speed of the Conservatives.\n\nIn 1983, reflecting the major local government boundary changes effected by the Local Government Act 1972, a new Meriden County Constituency was created as part of the parliamentary county of West Midlands. There were no boundary changes in 1997.

{"id": "1826162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826162", "title": "Rollins Pass", "text": "Rollins Pass\n\nRollins Pass, elevation , is a mountain pass and active archaeological site in the Southern Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado in the United States. The pass is located on and traverses the Continental Divide of the Americas at the crest of the Front Range southwest of Boulder and is located approximately five miles east and opposite the resort in Winter Park—in the general area between Winter Park and Rollinsville. Rollins Pass is at the boundaries of Boulder, Gilpin, and Grand counties. Over the past 10,000 years, the pass provided a route over the Continental Divide between the Atlantic Ocean watershed of South Boulder Creek (in the basin of the South Platte River) with the Pacific Ocean watershed of the Fraser River, a tributary of the Colorado River.\n\nThe abandoned rail route over Rollins Pass was nominated for and accepted into the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 because of significant events and engineering feats accomplished by railroading efforts in the early 20th century. In 1997, additional areas on the pass were added to the National Register of Historic Places to include achievements made by John Q.A. Rollins and his toll wagon road that traversed the pass.\n\nIn 2012, Rollins Pass was listed as one of the most endangered sites in Colorado.\n\n\"Rollins Pass\" is the sole, official name recognized by both the United States Geological Survey and the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN); a decision card was issued on Wednesday, December 7, 1904. The pass was first known as \"Boulder Pass\"—one of two variant names accepted by the BGN—the other being \"Rogers Pass\". The pass was also known infrequently as Rollinsville Pass.\n\nIn Grand County, Rollins Pass is sometimes given the sobriquet of \"Corona Pass\", named for the apex station at the summit, Corona. This nomenclature dispute provoked the ire of former railroaders; in fact, Frederick Bauer remarked, \"[Rollins Pass is] incorrectly called Corona Pass by neophytes and some locals.\" It is inconsistent, as well as atypical, to refer to mountain passes by the names of their apex stations. Fremont Pass, for example, is not named \"Climax Pass\"; nor is La Veta Pass referred to as \"Fir Pass\".\n\nThe elevation of '11,660 feet' commonly attributed to Rollins Pass (note the McClure sketch later in this article) \"reflects what might have been an original survey value obtained during either the late wagon road era or early railroad construction. ... The actual benchmarked survey elevation value of the summit of Rollins Pass is 11,671 feet (NGVD29), obtained during a 1952 second-order level line run from State Bridge to Denver by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey (predecessor to the National Geodetic Survey). When adjusted to NAVD88, the elevation is, without doubt, 11,676.79 feet.\"\n\nRollins Pass has been in continuous use for millennia: first as an internationally significant game drive complex that was hand-constructed and used by Paleoindians more than 10,000 years ago through the mid-19th century; followed by nearly two decades as a wagon road from 1862–1880; as a rail route (under survey, construction, and later operational) from 1880 to 1928; as a primitive automobile road from 1936 to 1956; and for the past years—from 1956 through present day—as a motor vehicle road.\n\nThe pass is traversed by Paleoindians and Native American game drive complexes, hiking trails, including the Continental Divide Trail; an airway radial (V8), a 10\" Xcel Energy high-pressure natural gas pipeline, and two roads:\n\n\nThe Front Range was created by the Laramide Orogeny, the last of three major mountain-building events, which occurred between 70 and 40 million years ago. Tectonic activity during the Cenozoic Era changed the Ancestral Rocky Mountains via block uplift, eventually forming the Rocky Mountains as they exist today. The geologic make-up of Rollins Pass and the surrounding areas were also affected by deformation and erosion during the Cenozoic Era. Many sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras exist in the basins surrounding the pass.\n\nPaleoindians and early Native Americans were the first to utilize Rollins Pass as a natural, low crossing over the Continental Divide for the purposes of communal hunting of large game, including bighorn sheep and elk. There are more than 96 documented game drives, including the Olson game drive, found largely above timberline and near the summits of multiple mountain ridges. Handmade rock walls drove prey toward hunters waiting in blinds. These unique high-altitude constructs were built, refined, and continually used over millennia. Currently the game drives are being studied by Colorado State University archaeology graduate and PhD students led by Jason M. LaBelle, PhD, the associate professor in the Department of Anthropology at the Center for Mountain and Plains Archaeology in Fort Collins, Colorado. The game drives built on—and over—Rollins Pass have international significance.\n\nThe Olson site (5BL147) is a multi-component rock walled game drive and is but one part of a much larger game drive complex located on Rollins Pass. Byron Olson and James Benedict conducted work at the site in the late-1960s. Present-day archaeology teams built on Olson and Benedict's work to expand the overview of the site using modern techniques. As of 2013, at least 45 blinds as well as 1,307 meters of rock walls are present across the Olson site; the purposes of which were to funnel game upslope to waiting hunters. Both radiocarbon and lichenometric dating suggest occupation by Native Americans spanning the last 3,200 years, with diagnostic tools suggesting even older use of the site, dating back to more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nGame drives at other locations on Rollins Pass yield hundreds of additional blinds and miles of rock walls.\n\nRollins Pass has a documented history as a migratory route, hunting trail, and battlefield among the late prehistoric and contact-period Indians of Colorado.\nThe first recorded use of the pass (then known as \"Boulder Pass\" or \"Rollinsville Pass\") by a wagon train was in 1862, nearly 14 years before Colorado became a state. Directions for wagons traveling from Rollinsville to Winter Park were published in newspapers. John Quincy Adams Rollins, a Colorado pioneer from a family of pioneers, constructed a toll wagon road over the pass in the 1873, providing a route between the Colorado Front Range and Middle Park; subsequently, Rollins Pass was named after John Q.A. Rollins.\n\nJohn Q.A. Rollins was born on Sunday, June 16, 1816 in Gilmanton, New Hampshire and was the son of a New England minister. Rollins is described as being a strong man and an extensive character, popular with almost everybody whom he did not owe and his one predominating fault was his failure to pay his debts. Newspapers cited that he was so careless about his credit that he could not keep track of all his creditors, and in turn, they had trouble keeping track of him. Rollins died on Wednesday, June 20, 1894 and is buried in Colorado's oldest operating cemetery, Riverside, in block 5, lot 12. His simple tombstone reads, \"John Q.A. Rollins | Colorado Pioneer of Rollinsville and Rollins Pass.\" Colonel Rollins' newspaper obituary mentions, \"No man in Northern Colorado was better known nor counted more warm friends than John Q.A. Rollins.\"\n\nJohn Rollins capitalized on this and received approval for his toll wagon road on Tuesday, February 6, 1866. The Council and House of Representatives of Colorado Territory passed an act signed by the governor approving the wagon road as the \"Middle Park and South Boulder Wagon Road Company.\" Records reflect the incorporators as \"John Q.A. Rollins, Perley Dodge, Frederic C. Weir.\" Yet, the \"Rollins road\" through Boulder Pass was not completed until the first half of August 1873. While the newspaper articles cited \"wagons can now be taken over this route without the slightest trouble,\" other articles countered, \"the trail ... is splendid for horses but fearful for wagons\" and \"the rocks, mud-holes, bogs, creeks, boulders and sidling ledges of that road, can only be appreciated by being seen, the only wonder is that a wagon can be taken over at all.\" Other articles were a bit more grim, referring to the wagon road as a \"little more than the rocky ridge of a precipice along which lurked death and disaster.\" Newspaper records reflect on Friday, June 12, 1874, James Harvey Crawford along with his wife, Margaret Emerine Bourn Crawford, made pioneer history as the first (nonindigenous) couple to cross Rollins Pass by wagons, and Mrs. Crawford is credited as the first woman to cross the pass. That day held many challenges, including a two-hour blizzard, \"which was of terrific violence\" and she remarked in a newspaper article, \"the bumping was so hard I thought I was nearly dead.\" As there was no formal road constructed from \"Yankee Doodle Camp on up, only an Indian trail, she and the children had been left behind while her husband took the wagon pulled by a pair of mules, a team of horses and a yoke of oxen on up and camped. Then he came back for her with the team and the running gear only of the wagon, and she had to hold the children on someway, despite the dreadful bumping\" with the \"wagon almost standing on end.\"\n\nThe pass was used heavily in the latter half of the 19th century by settlers and at one time as many as 12,000 cattle at a time were driven over the pass. The wagon road had one tollgate and the following rate structure: \"For each vehicle drawn by two animals, two dollars and fifty cents; for each additional two animals, twenty-five cents; each vehicle drawn by one animal, one dollar and fifty cents; horse and rider and pack animals, twenty-five cents; loose stock, five cents per head ... horse with rider, or pack animal with pack, ten cents.\" The cost for nonpayment of a toll was the same as causing intentional damage to the road: $25.\n\nAccording to the manuscript of Martin Parsons, \"Twistin Dogies Tails Over \"Rollins Pass\"\", each summer, Mr. Rollins would \"build a cribbing of logs ... and would fill the center with rocks and earth, which helped reduce the grade between the hills.\" The original log cribbing can be seen today on the narrow ridge of Guinn Mountain, north of Yankee Doodle Lake. Rollins also built \"The Junction House\", \"a large, two-story hewd-log structure\" as a hotel, \"at the point of intersection of the Berthoud and Rollins roads.\"\n\nThe road began to fall out of use and into disrepair in 1880, approximately one year before early railroading attempts over the pass begun.\n\nGuinn Mountain, encircling Yankee Doodle Lake, was used for mining from the early 1870s through the establishment of the railroad in 1904.\n\nThis area held at least \"four silver lodes\" or \"five patented lode claims, one patented placer claim, several prospect pits and the dump of one caved adit.\" This caved adit, once 365-feet-long, then lengthened to 850-feet, is still shown as a mine on United States Geological Survey topographic maps as the \"Blue Stones Mine\". This tunnel exposed a \"five-foot vein of ore varying in values from $16 to $25 per ton.\"\n\nIt was concluded that the \"Guinn Mountain area has little or no economic potential,\" despite listings of important mineral strikes in period newspapers. Further, \"ten samples collected in the area contained only negligible amounts of any metal. Samples from the Avalon placer claim, located on the South Fork [of] Middle Boulder Creek north of Guinn Mountain, and from the creek bottom were collected and panned; no gold was found.\" Despite this record, gold claims were nevertheless worked nearby with no published record of success.\nThere were multiple prior efforts to build a railroad over Rollins Pass in the 19th century and all attempts were met with impassable engineering challenges, financing issues, or both: \"GHS, Jefferson, & Boulder County Railroad and Wagon Road\" (A.N. Rogers' line) in 1867; \"U.P.\" in 1866; \"Kansas Pacific\" in 1869; \"Colorado Railroad\" (B. & M. subsidiary) in 1884—two tunnels located; \"Denver, Utah & Pacific\" in 1881 (construction started and tunnel located). The remains of the latter tunneling attempt can still be seen on the northern slope of the rock wall at Yankee Doodle Lake and the detritus from the attempted excavation of the tunnel was placed at the northernmost part of the lake where pulverized granite tailings can be seen rising out of the water. These tailings were definitively from the 1880s tunneling efforts as they are not visible in the early stereoscopic images from the wagon road era of Yankee Doodle Lake; further, the attempted tunnel was not part of the later rail line that ultimately summited Rollins Pass.\n\nIn the early 20th century, David Moffat, a Denver banker, established the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway with the intention of building a railroad from Denver toward Salt Lake City, Utah by way of a tunnel under the Continental Divide. Surveys began in April 1902 and construction was started in January 1903, beginning on the east side of Rollins Pass. However, the railway only reached Craig, Colorado. This entire line from Denver to Craig was known as the Moffat Road.\n\nThe line included a 23-mile stretch over the top of the Continental Divide, at Rollins Pass, with a two to four percent grade and switchbacks along many sections; the result was one of the highest adhesion (non-cog) standard-gauge railroads ever constructed in North America. This corridor over Rollins Pass was always intended to be temporary until what would later become the Moffat Tunnel was constructed and opened; therefore this overmountain route was constructed with more cost-effective materials: using wooden trestles (made of all Oregon fir) instead of iron bridges or high fills and wyes instead of turntables. Construction of this route was exceptionally dangerous and deadly: in a single day, 60 Swedish workers were killed when a powder charge exploded prematurely during the construction of \"Needle's Eye Tunnel\".\n\nAlong this route were three tunnels: Tunnel #31 (\"the tunnel at Ladora\"), Tunnel #32 (\"Needle's Eye Tunnel\"), and Tunnel #33 (\"the Loop Tunnel at Riflesight Notch\"). All three tunnels today are either completely caved in or have had multiple partial cave-ins. Other notable landmarks on the route included the \"Riflesight Notch\" Loop, located at Spruce Mountain: a 1.5 mile spiral or loop where trains crossed over a trestle, made a ~90 degree gradual turn to descend 150 feet, and passed through Tunnel #33 underneath the trestle.\n\nA rail station, Corona, was established at the summit of the pass, with a red brick dining hall, weather station, power station, and lodging. In summers, the train ride from Denver to Corona was advertised as a trip, \"from sultry heat to Colorado's north pole;\" tourists could stand in snowdrifts in the middle of July or August. Tours launched from the Moffat Depot, a small building constructed in the Georgian Revival style, featuring two-story tall windows, intricate exterior brickwork, and roofline pommels. This building, located several city blocks northwest from Denver Union Station, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and lay dormant for many decades after it was shuttered in 1947; in 2015, it was made the focal point of a senior living community center, after it was meticulously restored.\n\nDespite the fact that the line was enclosed in almost continuous snowsheds (wooden tunnels) near the summit of the pass, trains were often stranded for several days (and in some cases up to 30–60 days) during heavy snowstorms because snow could fall or be blown through the wood planking of the sheds. Delays affected the timeliness of both newspaper and postal mail deliveries. Coal smoke and toxic gasses collected in the snowsheds causing temporary blindness, loss of consciousness, and sometimes death. Workers on the Moffat Road had an adage: \"There's winter and then there's August.\" It was these heavy snowstorms that led to the financial demise of the Moffat Road and served as the incentive for construction of a permanent railroad tunnel through the Rocky Mountains and into Middle Park.\n\nFollowing scuba dives, no evidence exists that locomotive, rotary, or wreck debris rests at the bottom of Yankee Doodle Lake or Jenny Lake. However, many derailments, wrecks of Mallet locomotives, accidents resulting in injury and/or death, and/or the loss of portions of rail manifests occurred on both sides of the pass:\n\nDespite the challenges documented above, by 1918, it was reported that 45 or 46 engines were part of the motive power of the railroad along with 3 rotary snowplows.\n\nSeveral locations for the Moffat Tunnel were scouted prior to the selection of the present-day location; one possible location was identified at high altitude between Yankee Doodle Lake and the Forest Lakes.\n\nPlans to build a longer tunnel at a lower elevation were better planned and financed; the single-track Moffat Tunnel opened just south of Rollins Pass on Sunday, February 26, 1928. The Moffat Tunnel eliminated 10,800 degrees of curvature along the Rollins Pass route; the tunnel resulted in considerable time savings as well as money that was used for snow removal atop Rollins Pass. After the first year of operations, an annual report to stockholders showed \"marked savings in operating costs\" by 24.86%. Savings were seen in other areas, including in fuel reductions ($89,074.45 savings; $1.3 million in 2018 when adjusted for inflation), engine servicing ($156,188.89 savings); whereas gross tons per train hour increased by 34.84%.\n\nAfter the Moffat Tunnel opened, the tracks over Rollins Pass remained in place and were maintained at least as late as July 1929 as an emergency route. This emergency route was needed only once for a several day-long closure: on Thursday, July 25, 1929, dry rot of wooden timbers caused a collapse and 75 feet of rock caved-in and blocked the Moffat Tunnel near the East Portal. It took until Tuesday, July 30, 1929 for the tunnel to be cleared of debris. Permission to dismantle the rails on Rollins Pass was granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission on Saturday, May 18, 1935 and the rails were removed the following summer: the west side was cleared by Tuesday, August 11, 1936, and the east side 14 days later; contractors toiled non-stop, including overnight to remove both the rails and ties. A wye on the passing siding at the East Portal of the Moffat Tunnel is currently utilized for short-turning some modern services and marks the spot where the Rollins Pass line, if it still existed, would have merged into the modern route.\n\nThe route through the Moffat Tunnel became part of the mainline across Colorado for the Denver and Salt Lake Railroad, later the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, and now the Union Pacific Railroad. The Moffat Tunnel continues to be used for both the Amtrak's California Zephyr that provides service between Chicago, Illinois and Emeryville, California as well as for the winter and sometimes summer Ski Train that operated between Denver and Winter Park from 1940 to 2009; in March 2015 and from 2017–present, the service was rebranded the \"Winter Park Express\".\n\nThe original 1922 law that authorized the construction of the Moffat Tunnel specified that it should also be used for automobile traffic, with automobiles being placed on a ferry of flatbed railcars. To date, this has not happened.\n\nThe pioneer bore used to originally construct the Moffat Tunnel was later converted into the Moffat Water Tunnel by Denver Water.\nIn the era of powered flight, Rollins Pass provides an attractive way to cross the Continental Divide between west and east at a relatively low point for aircraft. Not only does the enroute airway radial, \"Victor Eight\", cross the pass; but also a rotating airway beacon was established in the mid-to-late 1940s and first appeared on aeronautical sectional charts in March 1948 as a star, indicating a beacon. The beacon and its supporting infrastructure have since been removed due to the introduction of the Low-Frequency Radio Range systems to replace visual navigational aids. The rough road that was once used to service and reach Beacon Peak at the Continental Divide, branches off of the Rollins Pass road, and is closed to all forms of motorized traffic per the current Motor Vehicle Use Maps.\nPlans to convert Rollins Pass into an historic automobile road were first published in November 1949. Several years later, on Saturday, September 1, 1956, Colorado lieutenant governor, Steve McNichols, opened Rollins Pass as a non-vital and seasonal recreational road. Each summer, from 1956–1979, Rollins Pass served as a complete road over the mountain pass for automobiles until a substantial rock fall in \"Needle's Eye Tunnel\" in 1979 closed the path over the pass. In 1989, after several engineering studies and structural strengthening of \"Needle's Eye Tunnel\" were accomplished, the complete road was re-opened only to close permanently in 1990, due to a rockfall injuring a sightseer. For the past years—since July 1990—no motorized route connects across the Continental Divide, effectively making each side a dead-end uphill route that must be traveled again, downhill, to leave the pass.\nIn 1969, a natural gas pipeline was placed on Rollins Pass. In the mid-1990s, Rollins Pass was closed for the installation of a 10-inch diameter Xcel Energy high-pressure natural gas pipeline. The pipeline, not always under marker, still is in existence and uses the low pass to reach the Front Range by loosely following County Road 8 in Fraser, utilizing much of Ranch Creek towards the Middle Fork of Ranch Creek below Mount Epworth, climbing the pass near Ptarmigan Point, and following much of the old railbed past Corona at the summit of Rollins Pass. The pipeline continues across the railbed towards and under the twin trestles, down the old wagon route on the spine of Guinn Mountain, and then towards Eldora. The pipeline undergoes internal inspections \"at least\" every seven years with the deployment of a smart pig inside the pipeline.\n\nA majority of Rollins Pass is located within the boundaries of two national forests—Roosevelt National Forest and Arapaho National Forest—and as such, is federal land. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act along with the Antiquities Act, among other federal and cultural laws, recognizes the nonrenewable and vulnerable nature of cultural resources and these laws protect and make it illegal to collect artifacts, including but not limited to: arrowheads, horseshoes, buttons, cans, glass or ceramic bottles, dishware and utensils, coal, railroad spikes, snowshed wood, railroad ties, and telegraph poles from Rollins Pass. All artifacts—from the prehistoric to the historic—on the pass are objects of antiquity and are being studied and documented by universities and government agencies. The material record of Rollins Pass is illegally carried away each year in the backpacks of well-intentioned visitors who want a souvenir; but once artifacts are removed, a place can never again reveal the mysteries of the past. Each artifact has important scientific and cultural value and theft harms the historical record. Visitors are encouraged to preserve the area for future generations by leaving items in place and sharing photographs and GPS coordinates (if available) with researchers dedicated to telling the story of Rollins Pass and an internet resource has been setup to aid with this project.\n\nCounty sheriffs as well as United States Forest Service Law Enforcement personnel and staff routinely patrol and enforce natural and cultural resources on Rollins Pass as well as in other areas within the National Forest System.\n\nOn both sides of Rollins Pass, the road prism contains both prehistoric and historic artifacts buried under the surface. Any improvements to the rough road through regrading, including paving, would first require extensive sectional archaeological excavations by the United States Forest Service. In several places, on or just under the surface, historical artifacts are covered with geotextile stabilization fabrics having characteristics that match the soil and permeability of the existing roadbed.\n\nThere are several drystack retaining walls on both sides of the pass, built without mortar, helping ensure they retain soil but not water.\n\nThere are several ghost towns on or near Rollins Pass, the most notable being Arrow, Corona, Ladora, the East Portal construction camp, Mammoth, and Tolland. There are also at least a half-dozen other established settlements, dating back to both the wagon road and railroad eras, scattered across Rollins Pass.\n\nThere are also several historic gravesites across Rollins Pass. One granite headstone at Arrow reads, \"R.M. Smith | June 28, 1842 | Nov. 12, 1909.\" One marker near the Eldora Ski Area states that it holds two members of John C. Frémont's third expedition in 1845–1846, although this is disputed.\n\nRollins Pass has unique floral, faunal, and riparian zones that spread across multiple Colorado counties; to best preserve the native environment of Rollins Pass, leave no trace and trail ethics apply to all visitors. Trundling is discouraged for safety and environmental concerns as well as to preserve artifacts.\n\nRollins Pass consists of several distinct floral environments including lodgepole pine and quaking aspen at lower elevations, and krummholz at tree line. Above tree line, the landscape consists largely of small perennial wildflowers, cryptobiotic soils, and alpine tundra. The latter being extremely fragile and if damaged, can take 100–500 years to recover. Leaving the trail can cause erosion, land degradation, possible species extinction, and habitat destruction and it is for these reasons vehicles, including off-road vehicles, are not allowed to leave the established road. There are at least two marked revegetation areas on Rollins Pass: one at Yankee Doodle Lake; the other at the summit leading to the historic dining hall foundation.\n\nThe mountain pine beetle epidemic, beginning in 1996 and continuing through present day, affects many forested areas in Colorado, including those on Rollins Pass. One out of every 14 trees in Colorado is dead. Trees affected by the beetles contain 10 times less water than a healthy tree and crown fires can quickly spread.\n\nThe top predator in the area are black bears (\"Ursus americanus\"), generally below timberline; however, they occasionally venture above the krummholz. The bears prey on bighorn sheep (\"Ovis canadensis\") and mountain goats (\"Oreamnos americanus\"), as well as yellow-bellied marmot (\"Marmota flaviventris\") in the region. Above timberline, pikas (\"Ochotona princeps\") are common. At or below timberline, both elk (\"Cervus canadensis\") and mule deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus\") are common. The presence of migratory bighorn sheep and other large game is the reason why Native Americans constructed sprawling yet intricate game drive complexes on Rollins Pass.\n\nThe porcupine can be seen at all elevations on Rollins Pass, including at (and above) the summit. The porcupine begins its rounds at sunset, as it is nocturnal; this member of the rodent family also has the ability to adroitly climb trees.\n\nAmong birds, the white-tailed ptarmigan (\"Lagopus leucurus\") are present on Rollins Pass, especially above treeline. Their seasonal camouflage is effective in the summer against the exposed blocks of granite as well as against snow in the winter, rendering them virtually undetectable. Brown-capped rosy finches (\"Leucosticte australis\"), rock wrens (\"Salpinctes obsoletus\"), and pipits are also seen or heard at timberline and near the summit.\n\nNutrient-rich ecosystems exist on Rollins Pass where water, and bodies of water, meet the alpine and subalpine tundras.\n\nThere are three lakes on the west side of Rollins Pass: \"Deadman's Lake\", \"Pumphouse Lake\", and \"Corona Lake\". On the east side of Rollins Pass are \"King Lake\", \"Yankee Doodle Lake\", and \"Jenny Lake\". Historically, Yankee Doodle Lake was referred to as \"Lake Jennie\" by John Quincy Adams Rollins, but modern archaeologists have re-interpreted this to be the modern day Yankee Doodle Lake; the railroad and period newspapers occasionally referred to this lake as \"Dixie Lake\". Also in the vicinity: \"Bob Lake\", \"Betty Lake\", the \"Forest Lakes\", \"Skyscraper Reservoir\", \"Lost Lake\", and \"Woodland Lake\".\n\nIn 2010, Pumphouse Lake and Ranch Creek were assessed by the Environmental Protection Agency and were determined to be polluted.\n\nOn the west side, in addition to the Fraser River at the start of Rollins Pass are the following creeks: the South Fork of Ranch Creek, the Middle Fork of Ranch Creek (fed by Deadman's Lake), and Ranch Creek (fed by Pumphouse and Corona Lakes). On the east side of Rollins Pass, the South Fork of the Middle Boulder Creek is fed by Bob and Betty Lakes and Jenny Creek is fed by both Jenny and Yankee Doodle Lakes; further downstream, Antelope Creek feeds into Jenny Creek. The South Boulder Creek runs at the start of Rollins Pass on the eastern side; but first flows through \"Buttermilk Falls\", a large 550-foot-long waterfall, near King Lake, visible from the summit and upper eastern portions of Rollins Pass.\n\nA summer 2006 project led by the United States Forest Service and having the participation of both environmental and user groups saw improvements made to wetlands, lakeshore, and upland habitats at Yankee Doodle Lake and Jenny Creek. Fencing was installed to restrict vehicle travel to designated routes and improve degraded areas. Before work could begin, sectional excavations by archaeologists took place to document the wagon road era settlements of the \"Town of Yankee Doodle at Lake Jennie,\" located at present day Yankee Doodle Lake.\n\nIn the summers, wildfire danger increases due to various environmental factors: low moisture, lightning strikes, high winds, and human-caused factors. As the pass is a recreational area, wildfires can also be caused by unmanaged, unattended, and/or uncontrolled campfires.\n\nAt present, no fire restrictions apply to the areas comprising Rollins Pass. Typically, these protective restrictions tend to be enacted starting as early as mid-late July or later in August:\n\n\n\n\nArctic conditions are prevalent during the winter, with sudden blizzards, high winds, and deep snowpack. High country overnight trips require gear suitable for −35° Fahrenheit or below. The subalpine region does not begin to experience spring-like conditions until June. Wildflowers bloom from late June to early August.\n\nDue to high-elevation above timberline in a backcountry setting, there is neither lightning protection nor lightning mitigation from sudden thunderstorms resulting in a high-risk, extremely dangerous situation for visitors. The most suitable—but not best—refuge available from electrical storms would be in a metal-topped vehicle as it would serve as a mobile Faraday cage.\n\nDuring the railroad era, a United States Weather Bureau observation station was mounted atop the large water tank at the townsite of Corona. Records from this station show \"the prevailing wind direction was west, the lowest temperature recorded was −30° Fahrenheit (in February 1910), and the most monthly snowfall was in March 1912 with 72.5 inches of snow.\" Newspaper reports mention winds in excess of 60 MPH, including at least one instance of 84 MPH, and temperatures of −44° Fahrenheit.\n\nA small, solar-powered weather station exists on the west side of Rollins Pass, located above Ptarmigan Point.\n\nWhile temperature, humidity, and other factors influence atmospheric pressure, the atmospheric pressure on the summit measures roughly 457 Torr (mmHg); while a standard atmospheric pressure measured at sea level is 760 Torr. At this pressure, many people, especially out-of-town visitors from lower elevations, can suffer from rapid dehydration and altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness. Acute mountain sickness can progress to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), both of which are potentially fatal.\n\nHistorically, newspaper reports wrote of both visitors and railroad workers experiencing heart attacks and pneumonia at the summit of Rollins Pass as well as severe frostbite, including in July.\n\nHuman-triggered and natural avalanches are possible anywhere on the pass and there have been three notable avalanches—all at Yankee Doodle Lake—on Rollins Pass:\n\n\nBackcountry skiers, snowshoers, and snowmobilers are advised to check daily avalanche forecasts, practice diligent terrain management, and always carry and know how to use rescue gear, including Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs).\n\nOn Wednesday, November 28, 2001, two highly-experienced backcountry skiers triggered a sizable hard-slab avalanche. From the accident report, \"The avalanche released from a southeast-facing slope and fell 600 vertical feet and stopped by crashing through the 10-inch thick ice of Yankee Doodle Lake. The displaced water resulted in a surge 10–12 feet tall along the south shore.\" The avalanche pushed both men into the lake and one survivor was sent 190 feet into the center of the lake. The survivor, suffering from hypothermia and frostbite, hiked to five miles to the Eldora Mountain Resort where he sought help. The search involved ground crews, air crews, avalanche rescue dogs, and trained dive-rescuers with specialized rubber suits. The body of the second skier was found 91 feet offshore. Both skiers were well-equipped, including having avalanche transceivers. Following the accident, each year in December, the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group holds a \"Joe Despres Memorial Dry Land Transceiver Training\" to include practices for using transceivers, along with avalanche courses, fundraising, and backcountry seminars.\n\nRollins Pass is managed by the United States Forest Service as a recreational location and can be accessed from roads on both west and east sides; however, no motorized route connects across the Continental Divide. The entire road is unpaved (dirt and rock), has no guardrails, and has a speed limit of 20 MPH. Current-year Motor Vehicle Use Maps (MVUMs) should be reviewed to determine which trails and roads are open to vehicles. Violators are subject to fines up to $5,000—\"regardless of the presence or absence of signs\" and operating a vehicle in wilderness areas is prohibited. Buck and rail fences have been placed at select areas on the pass to indicate routes or areas closed to motor vehicles.\n\nThere are no facilities, shops, restrooms, call boxes, water fountains, trash receptacles, nor shelters located on either side of the pass. The only exception is the Årestua Hut, located on the northern side of Guinn Mountain at 11,000 feet on the east side of Rollins Pass. The small hut was constructed years ago and is open year-round. A series of hand-constructed stone windbreaks exist above timberline north of \"Needle's Eye Tunnel\"—these structures date to the railroad era on Rollins Pass and are not prehistoric. These windbreaks currently lack upper coverings or roofs and serve only as aerodynamic dampeners for wind and wind gusts.\n\nBoth sides of the pass can be traveled by snowmobile when at least six inches of snow cover the road in the winter—generally beginning in late November or early December and lasting through early April.\n\nBoth sides of the pass are \"closed\" in spring—including several weeks in June—to any form of motorized traffic: snowmobiles, automobiles, ORVs, ATVs, or motorcycles for the prevention of road damage.\n\nBoth sides of the pass can be traveled—in good weather—by motorized vehicles in the summer and early autumn. Rollins Pass is scheduled open for vehicular summer traffic from June 15 through November 15; however, it is generally not possible given typical snowfall accumulations and slower melt rates in southerly-shaded areas, to drive higher than Sunnyside (site of the old block station) or Ptarmigan Point on the western side, or Yankee Doodle Lake on the eastern side before early-to-mid July. In 2019, and in other summers when the prior season's snowfall has been late and/or considerable, mid-elevation gates on the west side of Rollins Pass remained closed on June 15 due to an order, \"\"Extended closure due to snow, runoff, and road damage 36 CFR 261.54a.\"\"\n\nThe first high-country snowstorms bring fierce winds and create impassible snow drifts that are not plowed; this effectively puts higher landmarks—including the summit—out of reach as soon as late September or early October. On average, the near-annual existence of snow at or above timberline, ensures the road is only passable less than 90 days per year.\n\nSummer usage of the pass is currently classified as 'heavy' by the United States Forest Service; as such, parking can be very limited at designated parking sites. While the route mostly has gentle grades with switchbacks between two and four percent and does not contain loose gravel, four-wheel drive higher-clearance vehicles fare better than two-wheel drive vehicles, particularly in certain technical sections: some areas on the east side have up to a 17.63% grade; the west side has some areas with a 15% grade. In all narrow sections, the vehicle heading downhill must yield to the vehicle traveling uphill.\n\nThe Continental Divide Trail crosses the summit of Rollins Pass from south to north; the trail bisects the former wye at Corona and takes hikers through the Indian Peaks Wilderness past the dining hall foundation at the summit.\n\nThe road up the pass on the eastern side from the Peak to Peak Highway (State Highway 119) begins at the East Portal road running west, parallel to South Boulder Creek and the current Union Pacific Railroad tracks, to the East Portal of the Moffat Tunnel, and then rises on the abandoned railroad grade from Giant's Ladder to the closed \"Needle's Eye Tunnel\". From Rollinsville to East Portal, the road is an all-weather gravel road, with several chattery washboard sections, that can be traveled by regular automobiles. However, beginning at East Portal, at the formal start of Rollins Pass road (Forest Service Road 117), the road prism becomes very rough due to sustained sections of angular cobbles and potholes, the latter being several feet in size. The road has a level 2 road maintenance status described as \"assigned to roads open for use by high-clearance vehicles\" that includes the following attributes: \"surface smoothness is not a consideration\" and is \"not suitable for passenger cars.\"\n\nThis former railroad bed is open for 11.7 miles; two miles past Jenny Lake, there is a concrete-filled steel road gate with large rocks and Jersey barriers approximately one half-mile before \"Needle's Eye Tunnel\". A rough trail continues around either side of the tunnel for non-motorized transportation; the road is open for hiking and mountain biking beyond the barricaded portal of the tunnel toward the summit. No motorized route connects across the Continental Divide.\n\nA majority of the lower portion of the east side of the pass is posted private property with no trespassing off either side of the road as the properties belong to or are part of a conservation easement, \"Tolland Ranch, LLC\" and the \"Zarlengo Family Partnership, LLP\" as well as smaller land segments belonging to other entities. Shortly before the \"Spruce Wye\", the land ownership transitions to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest where it remains uninterrupted up to and including the summit and surrounding areas.\n\nThe road up the pass (County Road 80) on the western side from Winter Park starts from U.S. Highway 40 in Winter Park and has several sections of angular cobbles and potholes of varying dimensions, some several feet in size. The road has a level 2 road maintenance status described as \"assigned to roads open for use by high-clearance vehicles\" that includes the following attributes: \"surface smoothness is not a consideration\" and is \"not suitable for passenger cars.\"\n\nThe road is open for 14.4 miles and terminates at the summit's parking area. Exactly 0.15 miles before reaching the summit, capable vehicles can turn right onto County Road 80 and continue via Forest Service Road 501.1—this rough road rises above and bypasses the summit for another 1.8 miles before dead-ending overhead Yankee Doodle Lake at Guinn Mountain. No motorized route connects across the Continental Divide.\n\nA majority of the lower portion of the west side of the pass is private property belonging to \"Arrowhead Winter Park Investors, LLC\" and the \"Denver, City & County Board of Water Commissioners\", known more commonly as Denver Water. Shortly after the ghost town of Arrow and several miles before what was the \"Ranch Creek Wye\", the land ownership transitions to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest where it remains uninterrupted up to and including the summit and surrounding areas.\n\n\nDue to hairpin turns, steep terrain, and inclement weather, there have been several incidents and accidents, some fatal on or near the Rollins Pass road:\n\n\n\nThe complete pass is open and accessible for snowshoeing, fatbiking, backcountry skiing, and cross-country skiing in the winter and to hikers, bicyclists (including those on tandems and unicyclists), and horseback riders in the summer. For the past years—since July 1990—no motorized route connects across the Continental Divide, effectively making each side a dead-end uphill route that must be traveled again, downhill, to leave the pass.\n\nFor visitors in or on motor vehicles wishing to access and retrace the historic wagon route over the pass (from east to west), there are numerous closures, some permanent, and no motorized route connects over the Continental Divide at Rollins Pass:\n\n\nFor visitors in or on motor vehicles wishing to access and retrace the old railroad line, the majority of the railroad route or right-of-way over the pass is open and intact with several exceptions, detailed below, and no motorized route connects over the Continental Divide at Rollins Pass:\n\n\nSeveral trails on Rollins Pass are adopted.\n\n\nIn 2002, the James Peak Wilderness and Protection Area Act (Public Law 107-216) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The act amended the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 and designated lands within both the Arapaho National Forest and the Roosevelt National Forest as the James Peak Wilderness area and added lands to the Indian Peaks Wilderness, establishing these lands as federally protected territory. The act contained an administrative provision:\n\nIf requested by one or more of the Colorado Counties of Grand, Gilpin, and Boulder, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance and otherwise cooperate with respect to repairing the Rollins Pass road in those counties sufficiently to allow two-wheel-drive vehicles to travel between Colorado State Highway 119 and U.S. Highway 40. If this road is repaired to such extent, the Secretary shall close the motorized roads and trails on Forest Service land indicated on the map entitled 'Rollins Pass Road Reopening: Attendant Road and Trail Closures', dated September 2001.\n\nHistorically, both Gilpin and Grand counties have requested to re-open the road; however, Gilpin County has publicly withdrawn their support and opposes re-opening the thoroughfare over the pass, along with Boulder County.\n\nTo date, only minor repairs (mostly washout repairs) have been made. The difficulties and expenses of making improvements to the road, including coordination of maintenance and re-introduced liabilities—coupled with intractable disputes surrounding the 1990 accident in the tunnel, have become contentious and ongoing issues; however, alternative routes utilizing the Moffat Tunnel have been proposed.\nThe entirety of Rollins Pass resides in Class G airspace. Per the FAA \"Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge\", “Although ATC has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic, pilots should remember there are visual flight rules (VFR) minimums that apply to Class G airspace.”\n\nRollins Pass is traversed by a low altitude enroute airway radial, \"Victor Eight,\" the width of the airway is 4 nautical miles on either side of the centerline which skirts the summit of the pass. Pilots have recommended to avoid the area in bad weather due to extreme downdrafts, mountain waves, and turbulence on the east side of the pass.\n\nDrone (UAS) flights are permissible in Class G airspace on/over Rollins Pass provided all flights adhere to the FAA’s regulations for recreational or commercial drone flights. The one major restriction is that drones cannot take off from, land in, or be operated from congressionally designated wilderness areas. Remote pilots should exercise extreme caution as the enroute airway radial brings fast-moving aircraft within the area, including Flight for Life helicopters, search and rescue helicopters, and military aircraft; many of which fly below 500 AGL.\n\nA non-illuminated summer emergency backcountry helicopter landing zone exists at the summit, placed sometime between September 1999 and October 2005.\n\nA rotating airway light beacon (\"Beacon 82\" on aeronautical charts), was placed very near the summit of Rollins Pass atop what was then later termed Beacon Peak, in the mid-to-late 1940s at an approximate elevation of 12,080 feet. The glass-domed lighted beacon rotated six times per minute, marking the airway between Los Angeles and Denver, and it held a two-million candlepower electric lamp with a 24-inch parabolic reflector. The beacon was removed in the late-1960s and is currently in storage (not on display) at the Pioneer Village Museum in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colorado; however an 11 foot by 9 foot concrete foundation remains near the top of the peak along with the leg stubs used for the beacon's lattice tower.\n\nThere have been many documented airplane and helicopter crashes on and near Rollins Pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1826163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826163", "title": "Karl-Otto Apel", "text": "Karl-Otto Apel\n\nKarl-Otto Apel (; 15 March 1922 – 15 May 2017) was a German philosopher and Professor Emeritus at the University of Frankfurt am Main. He specialized on the philosophy of language and is thus considered a communication theorist. He developed a distinctive philosophical approach which he called transcendental pragmatics (\"Transzendentalpragmatik\").\n\nApel grew up during the political crises of the Weimar Republic. In 1940, he was a war volunteer with his entire graduating class. After the Second World War, Apel studied from 1945 to 1950 at the University of Bonn, first history and intellectual history, before he committed himself as a student of Erich Rothacker on philosophy. In 1950, he received his doctorate from Bonn with a thesis on Martin Heidegger.\n\nApel was appointed lecturer at the University of Mainz in 1961. He was a full professor of philosophy at the University of Kiel from 1962 to 1969, at the University of Saarbrücken from 1969 to 1972, and at the University of Frankfurt am Main from 1972 to 1990. In 1990, he transferred to emeritus status. He has held a number of visiting and guest professorships at universities around the world.\n\nHe was made a Member of the Academia Europaea in 1989 and a Full Member of the Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea in 1993. In 2001, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nApel worked in ethics, the philosophy of language and human sciences. He wrote extensively in these fields, publishing mostly in German. Apel's work brings together the Analytical and Continental philosophical traditions, especially pragmatism and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School.\n\nIn \"Understanding and Explanation: A Transcendental-Pragmatic Perspective\", Apel reformulated the difference between understanding (\"Verstehen\") and explanation (\"Erklärung\"), which originated in the hermeneutics of Wilhelm Dilthey and interpretive sociology of Max Weber, on the basis of a Peircean-inspired transcendental-pragmatic account of language. This account of the \"lifeworld\" would become an element of the theory of communicative action and discourse ethics, which Apel co-developed with Jürgen Habermas. Strategic rationality both claim to stand in need of communicative rationality that is seen as, in several regards, more fundamental. While sympathetic to Habermas's \"Theory of Communicative Action\", Apel has been critical of aspects of Habermas's approach. Apel has proposed that a theory of communication should be grounded in the transcendental-pragmatic conditions of communication. After taking his point of departure from Apel, Habermas has moved towards a \"weak transcendentalism\" that is more closely tied to empirical social inquiry.\n\nApel also wrote works on Charles Sanders Peirce and is a past president of the C. S. Peirce Society.\n\nAn early German-speaking adversary of so-called critical rationalism, Apel published a critique of the philosophy of Karl Popper: In \"Transformation der Philosophie\" (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.\n\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, Apel influenced other philosophers writing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Apel died on 15 May 2017 at the age of 95.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1826183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826183", "title": "False gharial", "text": "False gharial\n\nThe false gharial (\"Tomistoma schlegelii\"), also known as the Malayan gharial and the Sunda gharial, is a freshwater crocodilian in the family Gavialidae. It is native to Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as the global population is estimated at around 2,500 to 10,000 mature individuals.\n\nThe specific name \"schlegelii\" honors German herpetologist Hermann Schlegel.\n\nUnlike the gharial, the false gharial's snout broadens considerably towards the base and so is more similar to those of true crocodiles than the gharial, whose osteology indicates a distinct lineage from all other living crocodilians. However, preliminary nuclear genetic sequences may indicate the gharial and false gharial had a shared ancestor at some point in prehistory. Other molecular studies have similarly indicated that it is the nearest relative (the sister taxon) of the gharial. Along with close fossil relatives, such as \"Maroccosuchus\", it is thus increasingly classed in the family Gavialidae.\n\nThe false gharial is dark reddish-brown above with dark brown or black spots and cross-bands on the back and tail. Ventrals are grayish-white, with some lateral dark mottling. Juveniles are mottled with black on the sides of the jaws, body, and tail. The smooth and unornamented snout is extremely long and slender, parallel sided, with a length of 3.0 to 3.5 times the width at the base. All teeth are long and needle-like, interlocking on the insides of the jaws, and are individually socketed. The dorsal scales are broad at midbody and extend onto the sides of the body. The digits are webbed at the base. Integumentary sensory organs are present on the head and body scalation. Scales behind the head are frequently a slightly enlarged single pair. Some individuals bear a number of adjoining small keeled scales. Scalation is divided medially by soft granular skin. Three transverse rows of two enlarged nuchal scales are continuous with the dorsal scales, which consist of 22 transverse rows of six to eight scales, are broad at midbody and extend onto the sides of the body. Nuchal and dorsal rows equals a total of 22 to 23 rows. It has 18 double-crested caudal whorls and 17 single-crested caudal whorls. The flanks have one or two longitudinal rows of six to eight very enlarged scales on each side.\n\nThe false gharial has one of the slimmest snouts of any living crocodilian, perhaps comparable to the slender-snouted crocodile and the freshwater crocodile in the extent of slenderness, only that of the gharial is noticeably more slim. The false gharial is a large crocodilian. Males can reportedly grow up to in length. Three mature males kept in captivity measured and weighed , while a female measured and weighed . Females have been recorded at lengths of up to . The false gharial apparently has the largest skull of any extant crocodilian, undoubtedly aided by the great length of the slender snout. Out of the eight longest crocodilian skulls from existing species that could be found in museums around the world, six of these belonged to false gharials. The longest crocodilian skull belonging to an extant species was of this species and measured in length, with a mandibular length of . Most of the owners of these enormous skulls surprisingly had no confirmed (or even anecdotal) total measurements, but based on the known skull-to-total length ratio for the species, they would measure approximately in length.\n\nFalse gharials are native to Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and Indonesia (Sumatra, and Borneo), but were extirpated in Singapore and Thailand. It is unclear if they remain in Java. Apart from rivers, they inhabit swamps and lakes. The species is almost entirely found today in peat swamps and lowland swamp forests. In the 1990s, information and sightings were available from 39 localities in 10 different river drainages, along with the remote river systems of Borneo.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, \"Tomistoma\" occurred in freshwater ecosystems along the entire length of Sumatra east of the Barisan Mountains. The current distribution in eastern Sumatra has been reduced by 30-40% due to hunting, logging, fires, and agriculture.\n\nUntil recently, very little was known about the diet or behaviour of the false gharial in the wild. Details are slowly being revealed. In the past, the false gharial was thought to have a diet of only fish and very small vertebrates. But more recent evidence and observation indicate that it has a generalist diet despite its narrow snout. In addition to fish and smaller aquatic animals, mature adults prey on larger vertebrates, including proboscis monkeys, long-tailed macaques, deer, water birds, and reptiles. An eye-witness accounted of a false gharial attacking a cow in East Kalimantan.\n\nThe false gharial may be considered an ecological equivalent to Neotropical crocodiles such as the Orinoco and American crocodiles, which both have slender snouts but a broad diet.\n\nFalse gharials are mound-nesters. Females lay small clutches of 13 to 35 eggs per nest, and appear to produce the largest eggs of extant crocodilians. Sexual maturity in females appears to be attained around , which is large compared to other crocodilians.\n\nIt is not known when they breed in the wild or when the nesting season is. Once the eggs are laid, and construction of the mound is completed, the female abandons her nest. Unlike most other crocodilians, the young receive no parental care and are at risk of being eaten by predators, such as mongooses, tigers, leopards, and wild dogs. The young hatch after 90 days and are left to fend for themselves.\n\nIn 2008, a 4-m female false gharial attacked and ate a fisherman in central Kalimantan; his remains were found in the gharial's stomach. This was the first verified fatal human attack by a false gharial. However, by 2012, at least two more verified fatal attacks on humans by false gharials had occurred indicating perhaps an increase of human-false gharial conflict possibly correlated to the decline of habitat, habitat quality, and natural prey numbers.\n\nThe false gharial is threatened with extinction throughout most of its range due to the drainage of its freshwater swamplands and clearance of surrounding rainforests. The species is also hunted frequently for its skin and meat, and the eggs are often harvested for human consumption.\n\nThe false gharial is listed on CITES Appendix I. Currently population surveys indicate that while the false gharial is not for the most extirpated from areas it used to inhabit, the distribution of individuals is much more spotty than the previously more connective distribution, putting the animals at risk of genetic isolation. In large part, the isolation of false gharials is due to extremely extensive habitat destruction and disturbance within the species' area of distribution, few areas outside of legally protected areas are likely to bear viable breeding populations.\n\nSteps have been taken by the Malaysian and Indonesian governments to prevent its extinction in the wild. There are reports of some populations rebounding in Indonesia, yet with this slight recovery, mostly irrational fears of attacks have surfaced amongst the local human population. Yayasan Ulin (The Ironwood Foundation) is currently attempting to manage a wetland area in East Kalimantan, which is known to contain the false gharials.\n\nAlthough \"Tomistoma schlegelii\" is the only extant species in the genus \"Tomistoma\", fossils of extinct species have been found in Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary-age deposits in Taiwan, Uganda, Italy, Portugal, Egypt, and India, but nearly all of them are likely to be distinct genera due to older age compared to the false gharial.\n\n"}

The Conservatives regained the seat in 2010, only for Labour to regain it at the next general election in 2015, before losing it again in 2019 to the Conservative Party.\n\nThe constituency was held by Enoch Powell from 1950 to 1974, covering his unsuccessful bid for the Conservative Party leadership in 1965 and his controversial Rivers of Blood speech, which criticised mass immigration, especially Commonwealth immigration to Britain, in 1968.\n\nThis, in the 21st century, repeatedly marginal seat contains a mix of different areas; St Peter's, Graiseley and Park are relatively deprived inner city wards, with significant ethnic minority populations, mainly of Asian origin and are Labour voting-areas. Penn and Merry Hill are more mixed and suburban with mostly Conservative voters in times of economic prosperity. Tettenhall Regis and Tettenhall Wightwick are affluent suburbs on the western fringe of the West Midlands conurbation and are the strongest Tory wards in the seat.\n\nThe seat includes Molineux stadium, home to Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C..\n\nWolverhampton South West is one of three constituencies covering the city of Wolverhampton, covering the city centre (including the University and Civic Centre) as well as western and south-western parts of the city. The boundaries run south from the city centre towards Penn and north-west towards Tettenhall.\n\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Wolverhampton wards of Blakenhall and St John's, Graiseley, Penn, St George's, St Mark's and Merridale, St Matthew's, and St Philip's.\n\n1955–1974: As above plus Park.\n\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Wolverhampton wards of Graiseley, Merry Hill, Park, Penn, St Peter's, Tettenhall Regis, and Tettenhall Wightwick.\n\n1983–2010: The Metropolitan Borough wards as named above\n\n2010–present: The City of Wolverhampton wards as named above\nIn the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Wolverhampton South West is due to be abolished. Its proposed replacement, called Wolverhampton West, would lose St. Peter's and gain Bushbury North, Oxley, and Blakenhall.\n\nThe unit is heavily associated with the controversial Conservative politician Enoch Powell who was MP for the seat from 1950 until 1974, when he departed to the Ulster Unionist Party. It was during this time that he served in Edward Heath's shadow cabinet, from which he was dismissed in 1968 after his controversial Rivers of Blood speech in which he predicted severe civil unrest if mass immigration from the Commonwealth continued. This speech was reportedly the result of Powell's meeting with a woman in the constituency who was the last white person living in her street.\n\nHe was succeeded by fellow Conservative Nicholas Budgen, who held the seat until 1997. Budgen is best known as one of the Maastricht rebels of the mid 1990s.\n\nWolverhampton South West returned Conservative until a Labour candidate gained it in their 1997 landslide. Budgen was defeated in the 1997 election by Labour's Jenny Jones, a landslide victory for the party. As the next general election loomed, she announced that she would not be seeking re-election. From the 2001 general election, the constituency was represented by Rob Marris of the Labour Party for nine years until he lost it in the 2010 general election to Paul Uppal of the Conservative Party, on the same majority of 691 votes as Powell in 1950. Marris regained the seat from Uppal at the 2015 general election. The 2015 result gave the seat the 14th-smallest majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority. In 2017, despite Marris standing down after 11 (non-consecutive) years as an MP and Uppal standing for a third time, the new Labour candidate, Eleanor Smith, more than doubled the Labour majority. In 2019, riding the surge from Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, Stuart Anderson was elected as the new Conservative MP for the constituency.\n\nOf the four other candidates standing in 2015, the UKIP candidate kept his deposit by winning more than 5% of the vote, in the year before the 2016 EU referendum. He failed to do so in the 2017 election.\n\nTurnout has ranged from 87.2% in 1950 to 62.1% in 2001 and in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the 2011 census results, the municipality has 108,641 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality of Rakovica is located south of downtown Belgrade. It is bordered by the municipalities of Savski Venac on the north, Voždovac on the west and Čukarica on the east and south. Its neighborhood of Resnik marks the southernmost point of the Belgrade City Proper (\"uža teritorija grada\").\n\nThe first settlement on the territory of present Rakovica was mentioned in the Ottoman 1560 population census as a village called \"Vlaha\". Tradition has it that the place got its name after the crayfish (Serbian: \"rak\", \"rakovica\"), which allegedly inhabited the Rakovički potok which streamed through the village. The first mention of the monastery, already under the name of Rakovica, was from the 17th century. The village gradually turned into a suburb and then the neighborhood of Belgrade, one of the most heavily industrialized areas of Belgrade. According to the 1981 census, the neighborhood (local community, \"mesna zajednica\") of Rakovica had a population of 17,871, about one fifth of the municipal population. However, the local community was later split into several smaller ones, and those strictly comprising the area of the neighborhood of Rakovica had a population of 9,901 in 2002.\n\nFrom June 1945 to December 1946, Rakovica was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade’s Raion VII. Municipality of Rakovica was created in 1952, after the previous division of Belgrade into raions, from 1945 to 1952, ended. In 1960 the municipality was annexed to the neighboring Čukarica, but split again in 1974. The Day of the Municipality is October 14, the patron day of the Shroud of the Most Holy Virgin.\n\nDuring NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia, Rakovica was the only Belgrade municipality, that has been targeted almost every night, and eventually every day. The most heavy attacks suffered the hill \"Strazevica\" (under which was the Yugoslavian underground base), as well as \"Monastery forest\", most probably because anti-aircraft was located there. Although not whole Rakovica was under direct attacks, the largest part of the municipality suffered the collateral damage.\n\nRakovica is located in the valley of the Topčiderka river, where the brook of Rakovički potok flows into the river Sava, 9-10 kilometers (~6 mi) from Terazije, downtown Belgrade. The neighborhood developed between two large woods, Košutnjak on the north and \"Manastirska šuma\", on the south, north of the Rakovica monastery. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Kanarevo Brdo on the north-east, Miljakovac on the east, Kneževac on the south and Vidikovac and Skojevsko Naselje on the west. As in many cases, the boundaries between the neighborhoods are not firmly set, so in some parts Rakovica overlaps with Kneževac or Miljakovac, for example. The neighborhood of Selo Rakovica (Village Rakovica) is some 6-7 kilometers (~4 mi) further to the east, belongs to the municipality of Voždovac and is generally not associated with the term Rakovica.\n\nRakovica covers an area of . It is located in a hilly area, with numerous hillocks out of which many got urbanized and developed into Belgrade neighborhoods: Miljakovac (193 m/633 ft), Petlovo Brdo (205 m/673 ft; the top of the hill is in the municipality of Čukarica), Kanarevo Brdo, Labudovo Brdo, Straževica, Košutnjak, Vidikovac, etc.\n\nThe municipality mostly lies in the valley of the Topčiderka river. There are numerous other streams in the area, most of which flow into the Topčiderka: Rakovički potok, Jelezovac, Zmajevac, Pariguz, Kijevski potok, etc.\n\nCentral and northern sections of the municipalities are wooded areas. Entire northern section actually covers the southern part of the large park-wood Košutnjak, while the woods of Miljakovac and Manastir (\"Miljakovačka šuma\" and \"Manastirska šuma\") are located in the central parts, on the slopes of the hills of Miljakovac and Straževica, respectively.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census population of municipality was 108,641 inhabitants. Previously one of the urban Belgrade's municipalities with highest population growth, since the 1990s the growth slowed down. However, Rakovica remains one of the most densely populated municipalities of Belgrade with .\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nRecent presidents of the municipal assembly:\n\nRakovica is one of the most industrialized parts of Belgrade. Some of the factories in the area include: Industrija Motora Rakovica (engine factory), \"Rekord\" (tire factory), \"21 Maj\" (tractors and other agricultural vehicles factory), \"Frigostroj\" (coolers and air conditioners factory), \"IMP\" (foundry), \"Tehnogas MESSER\" (oxygen and acetylene factory), etc. Most of these factories suffered badly in the transition process. Another industrialized area of the municipality is the neighborhood of Kijevo with the quarry which supplies the entire Belgrade's building industry with stone and slates. The remaining industry is also mostly into construction and building (building companies and cement plants \"Komgrap\", \"Graditelj\", etc.).\n\nRakovica is located on important traffic routes. The valley of Rakovički potok is a route to the \"Kružni put\", suburban road of Belgrade and the future part of the projected Belgrade beltway, and a Belgrade-Požarevac railway, while the valley of Topčiderka is a route to the Belgrade-Niš railway. The other important roads in the municipality are \"Patrijarha Dimitrija\" street which goes through the middle of the urbanized area and \"Ibarska magistrala\" on the western edge of the municipality.\n\nMOC, Machines educational center and the Institute for the engines are located in Rakovica.\n\nOn 19 October 2017, a large shopping mall \"Kapitol park\" (\"Capitol Park\") was open in Rakovica, on the location of the former \"Rekord\" tire factory. A €30 million investment, it has a total floor area of . After a delay from June 2016, the construction began in March 2017.

{"id": "1826212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826212", "title": "Bérénice", "text": "Bérénice\n\nBerenice () is a five-act tragedy by the French 17th-century playwright Jean Racine. \"Berenice\" was not played often between the 17th and the 20th centuries. Today it is one of Racine's more popular plays, after \"Phèdre\", \"Andromaque\" and \"Britannicus\".\n\nIt was premiered on 21 November 1670 by the Comédiens du Roi at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Racine seems to have chosen the subject in competition with Pierre Corneille, who was working on his drama \"Tite et Bérénice\" at the same time. The subject was taken from the Roman historian Suetonius, who recounts the story of the Roman emperor Titus and Berenice of Cilicia, the sister of Agrippa II. Suetonius wrote a single sentence on the affair: \"\"Titus reginam Berenicen, cui etiam nuptias pollicitus ferebatur, statim ab Urbe dimisit invitus invitam\".\" In his preface, Racine translates this as \"Titus, who passionately loved Berenice and who was widely thought to have promised to marry her, sent her from Rome, in spite of himself and in spite of herself, in the early days of his empire.\"\n\n\nBecause Titus' father, Vespasian, has died, everyone assumes that Titus will now be free to marry his beloved Bérénice, the queen of Palestine. Madly in love with Bérénice, Antiochus plans to flee Rome rather than face her marriage with his friend Titus. However, Titus has been listening to public opinion about the prospects of his marriage with a foreign queen, and the Romans find this match undesirable. Titus chooses his duty to Rome over his love for Bérénice and sends Antiochus to tell Bérénice the news. Knowing that Antiochus is Titus' rival, Bérénice refuses to believe Antiochus. However, Titus confirms that he will not marry her. Titus begs her to stay but she refuses both Antiochus and Titus. She and Antiochus leave Rome separately, and Titus remains behind to rule his empire.\n\nThe tragic situation results from two irreconcilable demands. Titus cannot sacrifice his mission as the head of Rome for his passion for Berenice. The drama could have been based on events which conspire to separate the lovers, but Racine chose rather to eliminate all events that could overshadow the one action that he retains: the announcement by Titus that he is leaving her. He has in fact already made his decision before the play begins, and all that remains is for him to announce it to her and for her to accept it. Their love for each other is never in doubt, there is never any personal danger, nothing distracts the attention of the audience. The great art of Racine is to make something out of nothing, as he says himself in the preface to the play. The tension reaches its climax at the end of the fourth act, when Titus explains his dilemma, and Berenice refuses his decision. In the fifth act, they both come to terms with their duty; contrary to other plays by the same author, neither seeks escape through death.\n\n\n"}

Amongst other works, she wrote \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\", \"There Is a Green Hill Far Away\" and the Christmas carol \"Once in Royal David's City.\"\n\nAlexander was born at 25 Eccles Street, Dublin, the third child and second daughter of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk (land-agent to 4th Earl of Wicklow and later to the second Marquess of Abercorn), and his wife Elizabeth (née Reed). She began writing verse in her childhood, being strongly influenced by Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester. Her subsequent religious work was strongly influenced by her contacts with the Oxford Movement, and in particular with John Keble, who edited \"Hymns for Little Children\", one of her anthologies. By the 1840s she was already known as a hymn writer and her compositions were soon included in Church of Ireland hymnbooks. She also contributed lyric poems, narrative poems, and translations of French poetry to \"Dublin University Magazine\" under various pseudonyms.\n\nHer book \"Hymns for Little Children\" reached its 69th edition before the close of the 19th century. Some of her hymns, such as \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\", \"There Is a Green Hill Far Away\" and the Christmas carol \"Once in Royal David's City\", are known by Christians the world over, as is her rendering of \"Saint Patrick's Breastplate\". She issued \"Verses for Holy Seasons\" (1846), \"The Lord of the Forest and His Vassals\" (1847) – a children's allegory – and \"Hymns for Little Children\" (1848).\n\nIn Strabane in October 1850 she married the Anglican clergyman William Alexander, afterwards Bishop of Derry and Archbishop of Armagh. Her husband also wrote several books of poetry, of which the best known is \"St. Augustine's Holiday and other Poems\". She was six years older than the clergyman, causing great family concern. Her daughter, Eleanor Jane Alexander, was also a poet.\n\nAlexander was involved in charitable work for much of her life. Money from her first publications had helped build the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, which was founded in Strabane in 1846. The profits from \"Hymns for Little Children\" were also donated to the school. She was involved with the Derry Home for Fallen Women, and worked to develop a district nurses service. She was an \"indefatigable visitor to poor and sick\". She was criticised, however, for her endorsement of the class system, as expressed, for example, in the original third verse of \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\":\n\n<poem>:The rich man in his castle,\n\nUsually this verse is omitted from performances of the hymn.\n\nSeven hymns penned by Alexander were included in the 1873 issue of the Church of Ireland Hymnal, and eighteen of her works were contained in \"A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern\" (1889). They continue to be well-accepted, as nine of her works were contained in both the 1960 and the 1987 editions of the Hymnal. A posthumous collection of her poems was published in 1896 by William Alexander, titled \"Poems of the late Mrs Alexander\".\nIn 1913, after the death of her husband in 1911, a stained glass window by James Powell and Sons in her memory was installed in the north vestibule of St Columb's Cathedral in Derry, Northern Ireland, financed by public subscription. The three lights of the windows refer to three of her hymns and show corresponding scenes: \"Once in Royal David's City\", \"There Is a Green Hill Far Away\", and \"The Golden Gates Are Lifted Up\". One of her beautiful works was called the Fieldmouse. It is a 4 stanza poem.\n\nAlexander died at the Bishop's Palace in Derry and was buried in Derry City Cemetery. Her husband is buried beside her in a grave which was restored by the Friends of St Columba's Cathedral in 2006. An Ulster History Circle commemorative blue plaque was unveiled in her memory on 14 April 1995 at Bishop Street in the city.\n\nLukas Media LLC (FishFlix), released the full-length documentary \"Friends in Jesus DVD\", \"The stories and Hymns of Cecil Frances Alexander and Joseph Scriven\" in 2011.

The pass carries U.S. Highway 50 over the Sawatch Range, providing a route between Tomichi Creek in the upper basin of the Gunnison River on the west and the South Arkansas River, a tributary of the Arkansas River, on the east. The pass can be traversed by all vehicles under most conditions and is generally open year-round; however, 7% grades exist, and the area is prone to heavy winter snowfall, often resulting in temporary closures during severe winter storms. Ramps for runaway trucks are located about halfway down both the eastern and western sides of the pass. Much of the highway over the pass is three-lane.\n\nThe pass is widely considered one of the most scenic in Colorado, offering a panoramic view of the southern end of the Sawatch Range from the summit. During the summer, an aerial tram from the parking lot at the summit carries visitors to the top of Monarch Ridge above the pass (at approximately above sea level), allowing a wider view of the surrounding peaks. During the winter, visitors enjoy skiing at Monarch ski area. Monarch Mountain Lodge is located about 5 miles from the summit of the pass. \n\nAn unpaved road over Old Monarch Pass, elevation , connects to U.S. 50 on both sides of the Divide. This road can be traversed by passenger vehicles at most times during the summer and early fall months. However, heavy rainfalls occasionally wash out the east entrance to the pass. Check with a local ranger station for current conditions.\n\nAn automated weather station (AWOS), provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, is located atop Monarch Pass, broadcasting at 124.175 mHz, providing pilots of small aircraft access to real-time weather conditions near the summit. The high terrain and frequent storms, however, make this route problematic for light aircraft; the pass is steep and narrow, especially when approached from the east, with a sharp turn required at the summit. Aircraft accidents in the vicinity of Monarch Pass are frequent. Many Colorado pilots suggest that small aircraft avoid Monarch and, whenever possible, make use of the lower, flatter Marshall Pass just a few miles to the south.\n\nOn February 17, 2016 at 7:36 p.m. the weather station recorded a wind gust from the west of 148 mph, the highest official gust recorded to date in the state of Colorado by the National Weather Service (NWS). The 148 mph gust broke the previous record of 147 mph from January 25, 1971 recorded by the Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

The power station began commercial operation on November 24, 1987 and has a nominal net electric output of 1062 MWe. Due to inflation and cost overruns, Clinton's final construction cost was $4.25 billion ($ today), nearly 1,000% over the original budget of $430 million and seven years behind schedule.\n\nThe station has a single generation II General Electric Boiling Water Reactor. The present reactor operating license was issued April 17, 1987, and will expire September 29, 2026. Plans for a second reactor were shelved. Exelon, the owner and operator of the present reactor, announced plans to permanently close the power station in June 2017, due to the plants struggles to compete economically in wholesale markets, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars in recent years. The plans for closure were canceled, however, when the Illinois State Legislature passed and the Illinois Governor signed SB 2814, The Future Energy Jobs Bill. The legislation provides Zero Emission Credits for the plants' -free electricity. The consequences of continued operation include saving 4,200 jobs and the annual generation of 22 billion kWhs of -free energy.\n\nThe surrounding site and adjacent cooling reservoir, Clinton Lake, is owned by the operator, but hosts the Clinton Lake State Recreation Area and is open to public for a large range of outdoor activities. Only around are actually used by the plant's buildings and operation areas.\n\nThere were a number of problems during the first several years of operation. For example, the facility was down for maintenance frequently and was out of service for almost half of the time from September 1988 to October 1989. In 1997, it was also said to be producing \"some of the highest electric rates in the midwest\". After less than a decade of operation the plant's original owner, Illinois Power, had to close it in 1996 following some technical problems and safety violations resulting in a $450,000 fine.\n\nHaving deduced that it was not economical to own and operate only one nuclear generating station in the newly deregulated market, they kept it shut down during around 3 years whilst looking for an interested buyer. Exelon Corporation bought it for a more modest price of $40 million, with the purchase including the fuel in the reactor vessel and responsibility of all the radioactive waste in the spent fuel storage pool. The Operator and Owner is the Exelon Corporation.\n\nSoon after acquiring the power plant, Exelon made in 2001 a request to uprate its power by 20%, from 2894 MWt to 3473 MWt, resulting in an increase of 193 MWe, the largest approved by the NRC until 2012.\n\nIn January 2010, GE-Hitachi announced that the station will begin producing cobalt-60. The technology is soon to be installed at the Clinton boiling water reactor during Clinton's planned maintenance and refueling outage in order to produce cobalt-60. The radioactive isotope is used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes including cancer therapy, sterilization of medical equipment, food irradiation and materials testing.\n\nIt is produced by inserting a 'target' rod rich in non-radioactive cobalt-59 into a reactor core where free neutrons will be captured, turning cobalt-59 into cobalt-60. After retrieval from the core, processing can extract the cobalt-60 for manufacture into a useful radiation source. The vast majority of the world's cobalt-60 supply - over 80% - has traditionally come from Canada's National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Chalk River. In general, the supply situation for medical and industrial isotopes is shaky thanks to a reliance on this kind of aging research reactor. Clinton will be the only light water reactor currently producing cobalt-60.\n\nExelon Nuclear president Charles Pardee said: \"We view this as an opportunity for Exelon to support an important medical technology that saves people's lives.\" \n\nIt was announced in September 2011 that GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy and Exelon commissioned a feasibility study into creating Molybdenum-99(Mo-99) at the reactor. Mo-99 decays to produce technetium-99m (Tc-99m) that is used in around 50 million medical diagnostic imaging procedures every year. With a half-life of only six hours, Tc-99m is too short-lived to be transported to hospitals so is produced where it is needed in generators containing Mo-99. As Mo-99 itself has a half-life of only 66 hours, the world needs reliable, steady supplies of the isotope, most of which is made by irradiating uranium-235 targets inside a research reactor.\n\nMost of the world's Mo-99 comes from only five research reactors: Canada's NRU, the Netherlands' HFR, Belgium's BR-2, France's Osiris and South Africa's Safari-1. Issues at some of the reactors in recent years have led to worldwide problems with the supply of this vital isotope.\n\nIn September 2003, Exelon submitted an Early Site Permit to place a second reactor at the Clinton site — this was approved March 15, 2007.\nThe Early Site Permit does not actually grant any type of license to begin building a second reactor, although it offers the operator an avenue to begin the approval process leading to construction and operation of an additional power reactor at the site. According to the ESP, the new plant design will be of the AP1000 type, although the ESP does not state what gross wattage has been selected.\n\nIn June 2016, plans for the second reactor were shelved, and reactor 1 was to be shut down in June 2017. The plant was struggling to compete in wholesale electricity markets, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars in recent years. Shutdown plans were cancelled with the passage of Illinois Senate Bill 2814.\n\nIn December 2016, Illinois voted to subsidize Exelon with 1c/kWh or $235 million per year (depending on electricity rates) to keep Clinton and Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station open for at least 10 years, as natural gas had decreased rates.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Clinton was 14,677, a decrease of 0.4 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 813,658, an increase of 5.7 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Champaign, Decatur, Bloomington-Normal, as well as portions of Springfield, and the Peoria Metro Area.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Clinton was 1 in 400,000, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nInspired by the nearby power station, Clinton radio station WHOW changed its motto to \"WHOW, your radio active station\" in April 1989.\n\nInspired by the fact that Clinton Lake was created to provide cooling for the nuclear power station the Clinton Lake Sailing Association hosts a popular annual Midwestern regatta known as The Glow In The Dark Regatta. This regatta attracts sailboat racers from all over the country including FL, OH, MN, WI, PA, MD, MI, and more. In 2018 there were 34 teams registered from 8 states.\n\n\n"}

Barss' parents had married in 1773. They were one of the first families to settle in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Barss was the second of fourteen children. In 1798 the Barss family built one of the largest homes in Liverpool. The house still stands today and is part of the Lane's Privateer Inn.\nBarss gained experience as a privateer against the French in the 1790s, serving in several privateer vessels, as an officer in the ship \"Charles Mary Wentworth\" and in command the privateer schooner \"Lord Spencer\". The schooner sank after striking a reef in the West Indies but Barss and his entire crew survived to be rescued by other Nova Scotian privateer vessels. Barss briefly served as commander of the brig \"Rover\", a noted privateer vessel from Liverpool, Nova Scotia famous for its voyages commanded by Alexander Godfrey, another colonial Nova Scotian privateer.\n\nIn 1812, Barss took command of the \"Liverpool Packet\", a captured slave ship originally named the \"Severn\" and sometimes nicknamed \"the Black Joke\". Within a year, he had captured at least 33 American vessels. He was known for his excellent use of intelligence on American shipping movement, due in large part to his brother, John Barss. He was also known for his fair treatment of prisoners.\n\nIn 1813, following pursuit by the schooner \"Thomas\" of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which ended in a short battle, Barss surrendered the \"Packet\". This defeat brought no embarrassment upon Barss, as the \"Thomas\" was over twice the size of the \"Packet\", not only in gross tonnage (143 tons vs. 67 tons) - but in firepower (12 guns vs. 5) and crew (80 vs. 45) as well. After several months of harsh imprisonment Barss was set free, paroled so long as he did not command a privateer vessel. He was briefly captured a second time during the war in command of a merchant vessel.\n\nIn 1804, he married Olivia DeWolf, the daughter of judge Elisha DeWolf. After the War of 1812, Barss settled near Kentville, Nova Scotia. He had nine children and lived there the rest of his life.\n\nBarss died August 3, 1824 near Kentville, Nova Scotia. Barss is buried in the Oak Grove cemetery at Kentville.\n\nThe Stan Rogers' song, \"Barrett's Privateers\" may have taken some inspiration from the exploits of Barss, although the ship described in the popular song bore little resemblance to the sleek, fast lines of the \"Liverpool Packet\" and the inept Captain Barrett has no resemblance to the skilled and successful Joseph Barss.\n\n\n\n"}

He or she is elected on the same ticket as the Governor of Maryland and must meet the same qualifications.\n\nThe current Lieutenant Governor is Boyd Rutherford.\n\nThe position was first created by the Maryland Constitution of 1864. Under that system of government, the lieutenant governor served as president of the Senate and would assume the office of governor if the incumbent should die, resign, be removed, or be disqualified.\n\nThe state's present constitution, adopted in 1867, abolished the lieutenant governorship. However, the position was re-established by a constitutional amendment ratified on November 3, 1970.\n\nUnder the 1970 amendment, the Lieutenant Governor \"shall have only the duties delegated to him by the Governor.\" Maryland's lieutenant governorship is thus weaker than the office in several, but not all, other states that have one. For instance, in many states, including Texas, the lieutenant governor is the president of the state's Senate and in California the Lieutenant Governor assumes \"all\" of the Governor's powers when he or she is out of the state. In both of those states, as in some others, the lieutenant governor is elected in his or her own right, independently of the state's governor.\n\nIn practice, Maryland's lieutenant governor attends cabinet meetings, chairs various task forces and commissions, represents the state at ceremonial functions and at events with or without the governor, and advises the governor. If the governor dies, resigns or is removed from office (via impeachment), the lieutenant governor becomes governor. A vacancy in the lieutenant governorship is filled by a person nominated by the governor and confirmed by a majority vote of the General Assembly voting in joint session.\n\n\nConstitution amended November 4, 1970 to create Lt. Governor position.\n\n, there are six former lieutenant governors of Maryland who are currently living at this time, the oldest lieutenant governor of Maryland being J. Joseph Curran, Jr. (served 1983–1987, born 1931). The most recent death of a former lieutenant governor of Maryland was that of Blair Lee III (served 1971–1979, born 1916), on October 25, 1985.\n\n\n"}

The statue demonstrates the saint's refusal of the bishop's miter and staff offered by a cherub, while his right hand rests on a skull, evoking mortality. The simplicity of the monk's robes and the shaved head adds classical style to the heavily baroque sculpture. He also sculpted the tomb of Marquis Capponi in San Giovanni dei Fiorentini. Other Roman churches showcase his work including San Luigi dei Francesi and Santa Maria della Scala.\n\nAfter his return to France in 1747, Slodtz, in conjunction with his brothers, Antoine-Sebastien and Paul, produced many decorative works in the churches of Paris, and, though many have been destroyed, his most acclaimed achievement is the tomb of Jean-Joseph Languet de Gergy at St. Sulpice, which was commissioned in 1750.\n\nSlodtz and his brothers were members of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.

The company relocated to the United States in 2004. Its products are focused on computer and internet security. The firm operates a certificate authority that issues SSL certificates, and offers information security products for both enterprises and consumers. The company also helped on setting standards by contributing to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record.\n\nIn October 2017, Francisco Partners acquired Comodo Certification Authority (Comodo CA) from Comodo Security Solutions, Inc. Francisco Partners rebranded Comodo CA in November 2018 to Sectigo. The change in name came less than a year after Comodo CA was acquired by Francisco Partners.\n\nOn June 28, 2018, the new organization announced that it was expanding from TLS/SSL certificates into IoT security with the announcement of its IoT device security platform. The company announced its new headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey on July 3, 2018 and its acquisition of CodeGuard, a website maintenance and disaster recovery company, on August 16, 2018.\n\n\nComodo is a member of the following industry organizations:\n\n\nIn response to Symantec's comment asserting paid antivirus is superior to free antivirus, the CEO of Comodo Group challenged Symantec on 18 September 2010 to see whether paid or free products can better defend the consumer against malware. GCN'S John Breeden understood Comodo's stance on free Antivirus software and challenging Symantec: \"This is actually a pretty smart move based on previous reviews of AV performance we've done in the GCN Lab. Our most recent AV review this year showed no functional difference between free and paid programs in terms of stopping viruses, and it's been that way for many years. In fact you have to go all the way back to 2006 to find an AV roundup where viruses were missed by some companies.\" \n\nSymantec responded saying that if Comodo is interested they should have their product included in tests by independent reviewers.\n\nComodo volunteered to a Symantec vs. Comodo independent review. Though this showdown did not take place, Comodo has since been included in multiple independent reviews with AV-Test, PC World, Best Antivirus Reviews, AV-Comparatives, and PC Mag.\n\nOn 23 March 2011, Comodo posted a report that 8 days earlier, on 15 March 2011, a user account with an affiliate registration authority had been compromised and was used to create a new user account that issued nine certificate signing requests. Nine certificates for seven domains were issued. The attack was traced to IP address 212.95.136.18, which originates in Tehran, Iran. Though the firm initially reported that the breach was the result of a \"state-driven attack\", it subsequently stated that the origin of the attack may be the \"result of an attacker attempting to lay a false trail.\".\n\nThe attack was immediately thwarted, with Comodo revoking all of the bogus certificates. Comodo also stated that it was actively looking into ways to improve the security of its affiliates.\n\nIn an update on 31 March 2011, Comodo stated that it detected and thwarted an intrusion into a reseller user account on 26 March 2011. The new controls implemented by Comodo following the incident on 15 March 2011, removed any risk of the fraudulent issue of certificates. Comodo believed the attack was from the same perpetrator as the incident on 15 March 2011.\n\nIn regards to this second incident, Comodo stated, \"Our CA infrastructure was not compromised. Our keys in our HSMs were not compromised. No certificates have been fraudulently issued. The attempt to fraudulently access the certificate ordering platform to issue a certificate failed.\" \n\nOn 26 March 2011, a person under the username \"ComodoHacker\" verified that they were the attacker by posting the private keys online and posted a series of messages detailing how poor Comodo's security is and bragging about his abilities: I hacked Comodo from InstantSSL.it, their CEO's e-mail address mfpenco@mfpenco.com\n\nTheir Comodo username/password was: user: gtadmin password: globaltrust\n\nTheir DB name was: globaltrust and instantsslcms\n\nEnough said, huh? Yes, enough said, someone who should know already knows...\n\nAnyway, at first I should mention we have no relation to Iranian Cyber Army, we don't change DNSes, we \n\njust hack and own.\n\nI see Comodo CEO and other wrote that it was a managed attack, it was a planned attack, a group of \n\ncyber criminals did it, etc.\n\nLet me explain:\n\na) I'm not a group, I'm single hacker with experience of 1000 hacker, I'm single programmer with \n\nexperience of 1000 programmer, I'm single planner/project manager with experience of 1000 project \n\nmanagers, so you are right, it's managed by 1000 hackers, but it was only I with experience of 1000 \n\nhackers.Such issues have been widely reported, and have led to criticism of how certificates are issued and revoked. As of 2016, all of the certificates remain revoked. Microsoft issued a security advisory and update to address the issue at the time of the event.\n\nSuch attacks are not unique to Comodo – the specifics will vary from CA to CA, RA to RA, but there are so many of these entities, all of them trusted by default, that further holes are deemed to be inevitable.\n\nIn February 2015, Comodo was associated with a man-in-the-middle enabling tool known as PrivDog, which claims to protect users against malicious advertising.\n\nPrivDog issued a statement on 23 February 2015, saying, \"A minor intermittent defect has been detected in a third party library used by the PrivDog standalone application which potentially affects a very small number of users. This potential issue is only present in PrivDog versions, 3.0.96.0 and 3.0.97.0. The potential issue is not present in the PrivDog plug-in that is distributed with Comodo Browsers, and Comodo has not distributed this version to its users. there are potentially a maximum of 6,294 users in the USA and 57,568 users globally that this could potentially impact. The third party library used by PrivDog is not the same third party library used by Superfish...The potential issue has already been corrected. There will be an update tomorrow which will automatically update all 57,568 users of these specific PrivDog versions.\" \n\nIn 2009 Microsoft MVP Michael Burgess accused Comodo of issuing digital certificates to known malware.\n\nComodo responded when notified and revoked the issued certificates that contained the rogue malware.\n\nIn January 2016, Tavis Ormandy reported that Comodo's Chromodo browser exhibited a number of vulnerabilities, including disabling of the same-origin policy.\n\nThe vulnerability wasn't in the browser itself, which was based on the open-source code behind Google's Chrome browser. Rather, the issue was with an add-on. As soon as Comodo became aware of the issue in early February 2016, the company released a statement and a fix: \"As an industry, software in general is always being updated, patched, fixed, addressed, improved – it goes hand in hand with any development cycle...What is critical in software development is how companies address an issue if a certain vulnerability is found – ensuring it never puts the customer at risk.\" Those using Chromodo immediately received an update. The Chromodo browser was subsequently discontinued by Comodo.\n\nOrmandy noted that Comodo received a \"Excellence in Information Security Testing\" award from Verizon despite the vulnerability in its browser, despite having its VNC delivered with a default of weak authentication, despite not enabling address space layout randomization (ASLR), and despite using access control lists (ACLs) throughout its product. Ormandy has the opinion that Verizon's certification methodology is at fault here.\n\nIn October 2015, Comodo applied for \"Let's Encrypt\", \"Comodo Let's Encrypt\", and \"Let's Encrypt with Comodo\" trademarks. These trademark applications were filed almost a year after the Internet Security Research Group, parent organization of Let's Encrypt, started using the name Let's Encrypt publicly in November 2014, and despite the fact Comodo's \"intent to use\" trademark filings acknowledge that it has never used \"Let's Encrypt\" as a brand.\n\nOn 24 June 2016, Comodo publicly posted in its forum that it had filed for \"express abandonment\" of their trademark applications.\n\nComodo's Chief Technical Officer Robin Alden said, \"Comodo has filed for express abandonment of the trademark applications at this time instead of waiting and allowing them to lapse. Following collaboration between Let's Encrypt and Comodo, the trademark issue is now resolved and behind us, and we'd like to thank the Let's Encrypt team for helping to bring it to a resolution.\" \n\nOn 25 July 2016, Matthew Bryant showed that Comodo's website is vulnerable to dangling markup injection attacks and can send emails to system administrators from Comodo's servers to approve a wildcard certificate issue request which can be used to issue arbitrary wildcard certificates via Comodo's 30-Day PositiveSSL product.\n\nBryant reached out in June 2016, and on 25 July 2016, Comodo's Chief Technical Officer Robin Alden confirmed a fix was put in place, within the responsible disclosure date per industry standards.\n\n"}

The tenor voice sings G while the bass sings G momentarily beneath it, producing the clash of an augmented unison.\n\nIn this instance, the false relation is less pronounced: the contradicting E (soprano voice) and E (bass voice) (diminished octave) do not sound simultaneously. Here the false relation occurs because the top voice is descending in a minor key, and therefore takes the notes of the melodic minor scale descending (the diatonic sixth degree). The bass voice ascends and therefore makes use of the ascending melodic minor scale (the raised sixth degree).\n\nFalse relation is in this case desirable since this chromatic alteration follows a melodic idea, the rising 'melodic minor'. In such cases false relations must occur between different voices, as it follows that they cannot be produced by the semitones that occur diatonically in a mode or scale of any kind. This horizontal approach to polyphonic writing reflects the practices of composers in the Renaissance and Tudor periods, particularly in vocal composition, but it is also seen, for example, in the hexachord fantasies of William Byrd (for keyboard). Indeed, vocal music from this era does not often have these accidentals notated in the manuscript (see Musica ficta); experienced singers would have decided whether or not they were appropriate in a given musical context.\n\nMany composers from the late 16th century onwards however began using the effect deliberately as an expressive device in their word setting. This practice continued well into the Romantic era, and can be heard in the music of Mozart and Chopin, for example.\n\n\n"}

The second generation Captiva, which is a rebadged Baojun 530, was introduced in Colombia in November 2018 and Thailand in March 2019.\n\nCaptiva is a front-wheel or all-wheel drive SUV; the engines were supplied by Holden in Australia, the Family II naturally aspirated four-cylinder petrol or the Alloytec Holden V6 built in Australia, and later a 2.0-L turbodiesel supplied by VM Motori in South Korea.\n\nDesignated C100 by Daewoo and CG in Holden's terminology, the Captiva was launched in 2006. Styling of the Captiva was inspired by the 2004 Chevrolet S3X concept car. The S3X concept was developed by GM Daewoo's design center in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon and is based on the GM Theta platform. It premiered at 2004 Paris Motor Show. Another concept car, by Daewoo, the Chevrolet T2X premiered at the 2005 Seoul Motor Show with its design was based on the S3X, using a shortened platform. The T2X is referred to as a \"sport utility coupe\", accounting for its rear hinged doors, lack of conventional B-pillars, and shortened wheelbase—features that were first revealed on the \"Daewoo Oto\" (later renamed \"Daewoo Scope\") concept at the 2002 Seoul Motor Show. Production was slated for late 2006, but as of 2009 no further announcement has been made.\n\nFor the Captiva, the production version of the S3X, both five- or seven-seat configurations are available. Standard safety features include: antilock brakes, electronic stability control (ESC), front seatbelt pretensioners and force limiters, and driver and front-passenger airbags. Side-curtain airbags are standard on higher luxury-level variants in some markets. In crash safety tests conducted by Euro NCAP, the Captiva was given a four out of five stars crash rating. The results from the test were helped by the use of high-strength steel used in the body shell which was designed to spread crash forces over distinct load channels, therefore ensuring the safety of the occupants within the safety cell. The vehicle's optional active all-wheel drive system is fully incorporated with the ESC and antilock braking systems, consequently improving car handling and control. When the vehicle detects a loss of traction, the all-wheel drive mode is activated automatically. In ordinary driving situations, only the vehicle's front wheels are used.\n\nA revised Captiva range was released in the second quarter of 2011. The facelifted Captiva featured a new front fascia reminiscent to that of the Chevrolet Aveo (T300). Other noticeable cosmetic differences included LED turn signals on the door-mounted mirrors, redesigned wheels, and revised side air vents. The new SIDI alloy V6 was supplied from Holden in Australia, with the petrol four-cylinder 2.4-L and VM Motori 2.2-L turbodiesel engines being made in South Korea.\n\nThe new 2016 Chevrolet Captiva was unveiled at the Dubai International Motor Show 2015 on 10 November 2015. GM Thailand has also unveiled the facelifted Chevrolet Captiva at the 32nd annual Thailand International Motor Expo on 1 December 2015. A facelifted Holden Captiva was also unveiled a day later in Australia. The new Captiva has been updated with new LED headlamps, grille, bumper, and a redesigned dashboard, but retained its body and dashboard panels. The facelifted Captiva was also launched in Indonesia at the 2016 Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in Jakarta on 11 August 2016. The V6 engine was no longer sourced from Australia.\nThe Captiva is powered by the Australian (Holden)-built 3.2-L Alloytec V6 engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission, featuring Active Select. This engine is also shared by the Captiva's Opel Antara derivative, which uses a different design, but shares the same underpinnings and powertrain components. A four-cylinder VCDi common rail turbodiesel engine, co-developed with VM Motori, was introduced into the range.\n\nSouth Korean cars were branded Daewoo Winstorm from 2006. From 2006 until early 2011, the Opel Antara became available in the Winstorm range, as the \"Daewoo Winstorm MaXX\". As part of GM's strategy to phase out the \"Daewoo\" brand worldwide, since early 2011, the Winstorm has been marketed under the global Chevrolet Captiva name in South Korea. This rebranding came after the March 2011 renaming of GM Daewoo to GM Korea. At the same time, the Winstorm MaXX disappeared without a Chevrolet-badged equivalent (except Latin America and South America, which is sold outside of South Korea).\n\nThe Chevrolet Captiva was launched in Vietnam during 2006. The Captiva in Vietnam was manufactured in complete knock-down form by Vidamco (GM Vietnam), with 20% local parts content. From 2006 to July 2009, 8,500 Captivas have been sold in Vietnam.\n\nIn Thailand, Captivas have been produced at the GM facility in Rayong between 2006-2018. Chevrolet Thailand offered the Captiva in LS and LT variants, with engines comprising either the 2.4-L gasoline or 2.0-L diesel units. Captiva also featured the availability of self-levelling rear suspension, ESC, automatic headlamps, and rain-sensing wipers. Late in 2010, Chevrolet expanded the diesel line-up to include a mid-range LSX and flagship LTZ model. At the same time, Captivas fitted with the 2.4-L gasoline engine benefitted from E20 ethanol support and increased power to . On 23 June 2011, Chevrolet Thailand unveiled the updated the Captiva using the new 2.4-L petrol engine with support of E85 ethanol fuel. New features include an electric parking brake, climate control commands on the steering wheel; and later, the updated 2.0-L diesel engine rated at .\n\nThe Captiva entered the Chinese market in early November 2007. The only available engine is the 2.4-L Ecotec inline-four engine mated to a six-speed automatic.\n\nGM launched the Chevrolet Captiva in Japan on 30 July 2011, the first GM model to be released there since the company's chapter 11 reorganisation in June 2009.\n\nHolden in Australia and New Zealand have sold the vehicle under the \"Holden Captiva\" name between November 2006-2017, after announcing the model the previous September. The Captiva launched with the 3.2-L V6 and five-speed automatic transmission, but March 2007 had the addition of the 2.0-L diesel engine with five-speed manual or optional automatic. While initially manufactured in South Korea, production was temporarily shifted to Thailand from September 2007 until early 2008 while GM Daewoo upgraded its production facilities in South Korea to cope with global demand.\n\nSpecification levels were SX, CX, and LX, with a range-topping Captiva MaXX variant offered, although this was a rebadge of the closely related Opel Antara. The Antara-derived MaXX remained on sale in Australia until 2008, with New Zealand sales continuing on until the end of 2009. When Holden resurrected the Antara-based model as a price-leading five-seater \"Captiva 5\" in December 2009, the seven-seat only Chevrolet-based models were renamed \"Captiva 7\".\n\nRevisions to the Captiva 7 range were announced in February 2011, designated \"Series II\", with a March on-sale date. Changes included the adoption of the facelifted front-end fascia, as applied to Chevrolet versions, but with a Holden-specific grille and air intake. New design alloy wheels, \"Altezza\" tail lamps, and other trimmings feature, as does a revised interior centre console. Equipment-wise, the revised centre console houses a new 7-inch multifunction display in LX trim, which incorporates satellite navigation and a rear-view camera. Revised powertrains also feature on the Series II. The base setup is the SX trim with the 2.4-L petrol using front-wheel drive; the 2.2-L diesel is optional. The CX and LX variants add all-wheel drive and offer the 3.0-L V6 as standard, with the 2.2-L diesel remaining optional. All three engines are paired with a six-speed automatic.\n\nHolden announced a minor model year update in July 2012, the centrepiece of which is the addition of flex-fuel capability for both petrol engines, thus allowing them to accept E85 ethanol fuel. A cut in the official combined fuel consumption of the 3.0-L by 10% has also been achieved, with smaller gains for the 2.4-L petrol and 2.2-L diesel engines. At the same time, the base SX received standard rear parking sensors and the range-topping LX came additionally equipped with heated front seats and front park assist.\n\nIn the Middle East, the Captiva launched with two basic trims: one with the 2.4-L gasoline engine and another with the 3.0-L V6. Both trims are seven-seaters and offer front-wheel drive.\n\nOn 13 September 2018, Chevrolet announced that it is ending production on the first generation Captiva and will phase it out globally in favor of expanding the Equinox. The move had been in the works since 2017, when GM began replacing the Captiva in Australia with the Equinox for the Holden lineup, followed by South Korea in August 2018, with GM’s Uzbekistan plant ceasing production on 12 September 2018. With the discontinuation of the Captiva, GM will allow dealers to sell off the remaining inventory.\n\nThe second generation Captiva is a rebadged version of Baojun 530. The car is built by SAIC-GM-Wuling and exported to several emerging markets. It was introduced in Colombia in November 2018 and Thailand in March 2019. It was launched in select South American markets starting from April 2019, in Thailand in September 2019, and Middle East in May 2020. The left-hand drive Captiva for the South American and Middle Eastern market is imported from China and it slots between the Tracker/Trax and Equinox. The right-hand drive Captiva offered in Thailand, Brunei and Fiji is imported from Indonesia.\n"}

Robson began his 45-year career in Hollywood as a film editor. He later began working as a director and producer. He directed thirty-four films during his career, including \"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\" (1955), \"Peyton Place\" (1957), for which he earned his first Oscar nomination, \"Von Ryan's Express\" (1965), and \"Valley of the Dolls\" (1967).\n\nRobson died of a heart attack after shooting his final film, \"Avalanche Express\", in 1978. The film was released a year after his death.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, he attended Roslyn Elementary School and Westmount High School in Montreal. He later studied at the University of California, Los Angeles and Pacific Coast University School of Law. Robson then found work in the prop department at 20th Century Fox studios. He eventually went to work at RKO Pictures where he began training as a film editor.\n\nIn 1940, he worked as an assistant to Robert Wise on the editing of \"Citizen Kane\", the film debut of Orson Welles. He and Wise also edited Welles' next movie, \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), and were part of the drastic cuts of the ending of the film with which Welles disagreed.\n\nHe was promoted to editor for \"The Falcon's Brother\" (1942), an RKO B picture.\n\nBoth he and Wise benefited tremendously from producer and screenwriter Val Lewton, who was supervising a series of low budget horror films at RKO that would become legendary. The first one was \"Cat People\" (1942), directed by Jacques Tourneur and a tremendous success. He edited \"Journey into Fear\" (1943), made by Orson Welles' company but the editing was again done without Welles' involvement.\n\nRobson edited Lewton's next two films, both directed by Tourneur, \"I Walked with a Zombie\" (1943) and \"The Leopard Man\" (1943).\n\nLewton had been so impressed with Robson's work that he promoted him to director for \"The Seventh Victim\" (1943). Lewton liked the result, and so Robson directed \"The Ghost Ship\" (1943). Lewton would later give Robert Wise his first directing job, on \"The Curse of the Cat People\" (1944).\n\nLewton wanted to make non-horror films and RKO allowed him to make \"Youth Runs Wild\" (1944), a juvenile delinquency story; Robson directed but the film was not a commercial success. More popular was \"Isle of the Dead\" (1945) starring Boris Karloff. Lewton, Karloff and Robson reunited on \"Bedlam\" (1946), which lost money at the box office and turned out to be the last horror movie made by Lewton.\n\nHis success at RKO led to work on major film projects, and in 1949 he was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures for his work on the film noir drama \"Champion\", produced by Stanley Kramer. He made another for Kramer, \"Home of the Brave\" (1949), one of the first films to deal with the issue of racism.\n\nThat year also saw the release of \"Roughshod\" (1949), a Western made for RKO, and \"My Foolish Heart\" (1949) a melodrama for producer Sam Goldwyn. Goldwyn then used Robson for \"Edge of Doom\" (1950) and \"I Want You\" (1951). At Universal he made \"Bright Victory\" (1951).\n\nRobson briefly brought back his old mentor Val Lewton with fellow protégé Robert Wise in a partnership for film and television production, only to drop the ailing Lewton without explanation a few months later. Robson and Wise produced \"Return to Paradise\" (1953), starring Gary Cooper. For Warwick Films, he directed Alan Ladd in \"Hell Below Zero\" (1954). He made a comedy at Columbia, \"Phffft\" (1954), then had one of the biggest hits in his career with \"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\" (1954). This film earned him another DGA nomination. Warwick Films used him again for \"A Prize of Gold\" (1955). He went to MGM to make \"Trial\" (1955). His boxing film, \"The Harder They Fall\" (1956), was based on Budd Schulberg's novel.\n\n\"The Little Hut\" (1957), for MGM was a huge hit. Even bigger was \"Peyton Place\" (1957), for 20th Century Fox. Robson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. He was nominated again the following year for directing Ingrid Bergman in \"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\". For these films, he also received his third and fourth Directors Guild of America nominations. \n\nRobson produced and directed \"From the Terrace\" (1960), from a best-seller, starring Paul Newman. He produced \"The Inspector\" (1962) and \"Nine Hours to Rama\" (1963), the latter of which he also directed. After completing that film, Robson left Fox after a five-year association.\n\nRobson and Newman reunited on \"The Prize\" (1963) for MGM. It was a hit, as was \"Von Ryan's Express\" (1965), starring Frank Sinatra, back at Fox.\n\nHe produced and directed \"Lost Command\" (1966), a tale of the French Foreign Legion, and directed 1967's \"Valley of the Dolls\", a film panned by the critics, but a success at the box office.\n\nHe had a series of films that were commercially disappointing: \"Daddy's Gone A-Hunting\" (1969), \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June\" (1971), and \"Limbo\" (1972). In 1974, he directed \"Earthquake\", the film that introduced \"Sensurround\".\n\nOn 20 June 1978, Robson died of a heart attack in London after completing \"Avalanche Express\". The film was released a year after his death. He is interred in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Mark Robson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1722 Vine Street.\n\n"}
{"id": "1826289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826289", "title": "Anytime You Need a Friend", "text": "Anytime You Need a Friend\n\n\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, for her third studio album, \"Music Box\" (1993). It was released on May 31, 1994 through Columbia Records, as the fifth and final single from the album. The song is influenced by pop, R&B and gospel music genres. While the album focused heavily on pop oriented and radio friendly material, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" deviated from the formula, finishing as the only gospel-infused song on \"Music Box\". Lyrically, the song's protagonist tells her love interest that anytime he may need a friend, she will be there unconditionally for him. Throughout the song's bridge and climax, critics noted the lyrics altering from those of a friend, to those of a lover.\n\nThe song was well received by contemporary music critics, many of whom praised Carey's large spanning vocal range, as well as its gospel influence that they felt was missing on most of \"Music Box\". Aside from its critical acceptance, the song achieved strong worldwide chart positions and peaked at number twelve on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but became her first charting single to miss out the top-ten. Additionally, it peaked at number five in Canada and topped the singles charts in Finland. The song attained a top-twenty peak position in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nCarey performed \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" live on several televised talk and award shows around the world, including the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", the British music chart program \"Top of the Pops\" and German entertainment show \"Wetten, dass..?\". Additionally, the song served as a closing number on Carey's Music Box and Daydream World Tours, and was featured on her compilation albums, \"Greatest Hits\" (2001) and \"The Ballads\" (2008). Although several remixes were commissioned for the song, the C+C remix became the most notable, being produced by C+C Music Factory's David Cole and Robert Clivillés, and the first of Carey's remixes to feature her on production credits.\n\nThe song's music video was filmed by Danielle Federici, in New York during the summer of 1994. The video was filmed in black-and-white fashion, and features Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with a straightened hairstyle for the first time in her career. Additionally, the music video showcases scenes of Carey singing by a large church choir in a foyer, as well as several people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, who are alone and depressed. As the video progresses, the child and man are befriended after brief interludes and prayers to God. The song's C+C remix also features its own music video, displaying behind the scenes footage of Carey and her staff enjoying themselves during the original video's filming.\n\nFor her third studio effort, Columbia Records decided to market Carey in a similar fashion to that of her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, \"Music Box\" (1993). On the album's first track \"Dreamlover\", Carey worked with Dave Hall throughout the song's entire production. In order to help with some of the song's arrangements, Mottola enrolled the help of Walter Afanasieff, who took on the completed track and transformed it into a more commercial hit. \"Music Box\" received mixed critical response from contemporary critics, who suggested that in lowering Carey's vocal bombast, her energy level decreased and felt the album had an \"absence of passion.\" The only song that was not subject to the common criticism was \"Anytime You Need a Friend,\" which some called the album's only real glimpse of Carey's upper vocal registers, and one of the only passionate and gospel moments on \"Music Box\". In an interview, Carey described that although the album's main goal was to be more commercial and radio-friendly than her previous release, she felt the need to include at least one song that featured a church choir and traces of the music that influenced her growing up as a child.\n\n\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" is a mid-tempo song which draws influence from pop, R&B and gospel musical genres. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of C major, while the beat is set in the signature of common time, which moves at a moderate pace of 83 beats per minute. It has a sequence of Am/C–Bm(no5)–E/G–Am as its chord progression. Carey's vocals in the song span over three octaves, from the low note of an E to the high note of a B. The song was written by Carey and Afanasieff, with production helmed by the pair as well. After the song's bridge, a church choir is introduced and featured throughout its final chorus and climax. Carey's vocals are layered over the background gospel-styled vocals on the final chorus, after which she uses the whistle register to close the song. The song's lyrics describe a relationship the protagonist has with another individual, telling them that anytime they need a friend, she will be there unconditionally.\n\nThroughout the song, the lyrics seemingly show the evolving relationship between the couple. Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I will be here / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever be lonely / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present. Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to If you just believe in me / I will love you endlessly / Take my hand / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go. The protagonist is willing to accept the relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget or \"let go\".\n\n\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics, many of whom praised the song's gospel influence as well as Carey's vocal range. Following the mixed reception to the song's parent album, \"Music Box\", \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" was deemed a strong contrast to the album's pop influence. Critics agreed that through lowering Carey's vocal bombast, the album suffered due to lowered passion and energy levels. The song however, was considered the only standout from the album, altering heavily from the pop oriented formula of \"Music Box\". J.D. Considine from \"The Baltimore Sun\" wrote \"Where another singer might have been tempted to turn \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" into a full-blown sanctified sing-out, Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff use the gospel harmonies on the chorus as contrast for Carey's pop soul vocal.\" A writer from \"Portland Press Herald\" called the song one of Carey's \"original classics\", and felt it earned a place on her compilation album \"#1's\", even though it did not top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In an article from the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\", a writer commented that Carey's vocal range in the song sounds as if it's from a \"glass-shattering dimension\" and complimented her incorporation of the gospel genre and church choir into the song's climax. Christopher John Farley from \"Time\" described the song as \"gospel flavored\" and wrote \"'Anytime You Need a Friend' demonstrates Carey's vocal power, although too fleetingly.\" While calling it \"undeniably strong\", David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the song a mixed review, writing \"'Anytime You Need a Friend' feature gospel-inflected choirs seemingly intended to demonstrate that Carey has soul — which she doesn't — but they're beautifully arranged, and they serve as a nice counterpoint to Carey's own lapses into show-offy vocal gymnastics.\" Pop Rescue said the gospel choir \"works perfectly in contrast to Mariah’s vocals, allowing her to focus on hitting some incredibly high notes with the strength of the choir behind her.\" Suraya Attas from \"The Straits Times\" described Carey's voice as husky, and felt it \"exploited her vocal range to the fullest.\" In 2003, \"The Daily Record\" named \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" one of the \"World's Greatest First Dance Songs.\" \"USA Today\" critic John T. Jones called the song \"inspirational\", while a writer from \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" branded it \"the center of the album.\" \"Anytime You Need A Friend\" won a BMI Pop Award and an ASCAP Pop Music Award for the Songwriter Award in 1995.\n\n\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" became the first of Carey's singles to not reach the top-ten on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song debuted at number 45 on the chart and eventually peaked at number 12, remaining in the top-40 for 18 weeks and on the chart for 21. Despite this, it was popular on US radio and was ranked number forty-seven on the 1994 Year-End Charts, giving Carey three singles in the top half of the chart. On the Year-End Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" finished at number 21 and number 39 on the Hot Dance Music Club Play Singles Year-End Chart. In Canada, the song debuted at number 82 on the Canadian \"RPM\" Singles Chart during the week of May 23, 1994. Seven weeks later, the song reached its peak of number five on the singles chart, spending three consecutive weeks at the position and a total of 20 weeks on the chart. On the \"RPM\" Year-End Charts, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" finished at number 39. On the week dated June 19, 1994 on the Australian Singles Chart, the song entered at number 48. Weeks later, it ascended to its peak position of number 12, where it stayed for one week, and a total of 17 weeks fluctuating inside the singles chart. \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 35,000 units. On the Dutch Top 40 chart, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" reached the number one position on the singles chart.\n\nIn France, the single entered the chart at number 43 during the week of October 29, 1994. After spending one week at its peak position of number 12, the song fluctuated inside the singles chart for a total of 16 weeks. In Germany and Ireland, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" reached numbers 31 and 16 on their respective singles charts. On the New Zealand Singles Chart dated June 26, 1994, the song entered the chart at number nine. After spending two weeks at its peak position of number five, and a total of 14 weeks in the singles chart, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), denoting shipments of over 7,500 units. In Switzerland, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" peaked at number 15, however spending 17 weeks fluctuating in the Swiss Singles Chart. On the UK Singles Chart week dated June 18, 1994, the song debuted at number nine. The following week, it reached its peak position of number eight, spending a total of ten weeks in the singles chart. Following a live performance of the song by Eoghan Quigg on the fifth series of the British talent show \"The X Factor\", \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" re-surged onto the singles chart at number 96 on November 22, 2008. As of 2010, MTV estimates sales of the song in the United Kingdom to be at 100,000 units.\n\n\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" was remixed by David Cole and Robert Clivillés of C+C Music Factory. Although over fifteen various edits and extended mixes were created, for the most part they are based on the \"C+C Club Mix.\" Other variations, extended mixes, and edits include but are not limited to the \"All That and More Mix,\" \"Dave's Empty Pass,\" and the \"Boriqua Tribe Mix\". Cory Rooney and Mark Morales created a \"Soul Convention Mix\" and a stringapella for the song. Because of the large number of remixes, two maxi singles were released in the US Carey was given co-producing credit for both the C&C mixes and the Soul Convention/Stringapella, the first time that she had been given producing credit on remixes of her songs. Gregg Shapiro from the \"Windy City Times\" complimented the remix, writing \"the presence of each improves on the original. They have something new to say; even with the songs that began as dance tracks.\" Jose F. Promis gave the C+C remix two and a half out of five stars, writing how the remix found Carey \"getting quite gritty and earthy.\" He concluded his review with \"It made for a topnotch dancefloor number, and stands as an excellent example of early- to mid-'90s dance music, not to mention being one of the singer's most compelling, underrated, and forgotten efforts.\"\n\nThe music video, directed by Danielle Federici, was filmed during the early summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely and in need of a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.\n\nConsecutively, during the song's bridge, Carey watches as the small child's mother carries her to a nearby playground where her friends are frolicking and playing. Similarly, the elderly man is met with some other elderly citizens, who accompany him to another building nearby. During the song's climax, Carey joins the choir, flailing her hands wildly towards the sky, and smiling and gazing into the cloudy morning. Renee Graham from \"The Boston Globe\" gave the video two out of four stars. She complimented on the fact that the video captured the song's lyrical essence and how it managed to portray it in a clear and concise way. Although calling it \"simple,\" Graham commented that \"Videos have never really been Mariah Carey's thing, and frankly, they've never had to be. Carey has a killer voice, so the last thing she'd want to do is overshadow her singing with a lot of choreography, complicated story lines or explosions.\" Author Chris Nickson compared several parts of the video to religion and belief in God. During such scenes when Carey appears with the choir, he felt it seemed as though they were both channeling a common entity through music; God. Additionally, he claimed it was more evident with each passing scene of the video, as each of the lonely people in the video gaze up into the skies, possibly praying or searching for an answer to their loneliness. A video was commissioned for the C+C club mix of the song. Known as the C+C video edit, it was also directed by Danielle Federici and serves as a behind the scenes addendum to the main music video. It is also filmed in black and white, and is composed of clips of Carey and her friends during filming of the video, where they chat, laugh and enjoy time with each other. Carey's husband at the time Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance in the video, appearing alongside Carey during the second verse. The remix video was later included on the 1995 home video release, \"\".\n\nCarey promoted \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" on several live televised performances throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. Carey's performance of the song at an intimate concert at Proctor's Theatre on July 15, 1993 was filmed and released as the VHS \"Here Is Mariah Carey\". Carey performed the song during a live appearance on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", which was followed by an interview regarding the album. During the performance, a live band and several male and female background vocalists were featured. Promotion through Europe included a visit and performance on the British music chart program \"Top of the Pops\", German entertainment show \"Wetten, dass..?\", \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" in Australia, and the 1993 Japanese Music Fair. Aside from the several televised appearances, Carey performed the song throughout her Music Box Tour (1993) and Daydream World Tour (1996). During the shows in 1993, Carey featured the song as the fifteenth song on the set-list, and was performed in a similar fashion as on her televised appearances.\n\nPrior to beginning the song, Carey urged the crowd to \"never be lonely\" and \"always try and find that special person in your life.\" Following the show in Chicago, \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Greg Kot felt that her performance of the song truly \"demonstrated that her multi-octave voice is no studio fabrication.\"\nDuring her shows at the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the original version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers made their way to the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. From 1996 to 2019, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.\n\nCarey started performing the song for the first time in 23 years on Caution World Tour in 2019.\n\nIn a review done by Digital Spy for Leona Lewis' debut album, \"Spirit\", Nick Levine felt the song \"Footprints in the Sand\" borrowed heavily from Carey's track, writing \"'Footprints In The Sand' seems hellbent on revisiting Mariah Carey's schlock-pop masterwork 'Anytime You Need A Friend.'\" \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" was covered on several different occasions on a variety of reality and talent competitions. Some became heavily popularized by the media due to the nature of the performance or performer. On the fifth season of the British talent program \"The X Factor\", contestant Eoghan Quigg performed a live cover of the song during a \"Mariah Carey\" themed week. The song was chosen by Simon Cowell, who felt it would fit his younger vocals. Following the performance, he received acclaim from all three judges. Following the show's end, Quigg embarked on a live tour throughout 2009 alongside the other finalists, performing the song at each show alongside fellow contestant, Diana Vickers. Similarly, on the fourth season of the reality talent show \"America's Got Talent\", a trio of children named Michael, Avery and Nadia, together forming \"The Voices of Glory,\" performed a live rendition of the song. Their performance was well received by the judges, with David Hasselhoff exclaiming \"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful job.\"\n\nAustrian CD Maxi-Single\n\nEuropean 7\" Vinyl\n\nEuropean CD maxi-single\n\nUS CD maxi-single 1\n\nUS CD maxi-single 2\nThese credits were adapted from the \"Music Box\" liner notes.\n\n\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" was recorded at Right Track Studios, New York, and mixed at Sony Music Studios, New York.\n\n\n"}

It was previously the students' union of the federal University of London, known as the University of London Union (commonly referred to as ULU, pron. 'yoo-loo'), which was closed and transformed into Student Central in August 2014. Since the closure of its student governance, each student is instead primarily affiliated to a student union of their individual college, as the University of London is a federal structure encompassing many constituent colleges.\n\nULU provided a range of services on an intercollegiate basis, including cultural, recreational and sporting activities. Its seven-floor building in Malet Street, Central London, next to Birkbeck, University of London, included bars, restaurants, shops, banks, swimming pool and a live music venue.\n\nULU was founded in 1921, originally as the University of London Union Society, and moved into its main building on Malet Street, near Senate House, in 1957. It represented students to the University and beyond, whilst also providing support and resources to the students' unions of individual colleges.\n\nOn 3 May 2013, the University of London announced that the union would cease to exist. This move was condemned by some students and campaign groups, who ran a campaign to keep the building in student hands. Other students however welcomed the move; this was in part due to fears that the Union was undemocratic, as it recorded a very low election turnout of just 2%. This was against the backdrop of higher turnouts at other student union elections.\n\nAt the time of its closure, it was one of Europe's largest student unions representing over 120,000 University of London students. \n\nUpon the University of London Union's abolition, its former building and website was rebranded as 'Student Central, London', and is now operated by the former staff of ULU employed by the University of London. 'Student Central, London' offers full membership to University of London students, and associate membership to other university students, and other groups.\n\nIn March 2017, national promoter & event management company VMS Live agreed a deal with Student Central to bring live music back to the former ULU venue. At the time of writing many high-profile gigs have been confirmed firmly putting the venue back on the national touring circuit \n\nULU aimed to represent the diverse students and students’ unions of the University of London.\n\nThe ULU building and venue was widely known as one for gigs that launched major artists such as the Kaiser Chiefs and Goldfrapp.\n\nThe Union funded and published a student newspaper, London Student, although the editorial content was not controlled by the Union as a whole but solely by the elected Editor. London Student was relaunched as a co-operative in January 2015.\n\nOne of ULU's main activities was the provision of Sport Leagues and Sport Clubs. The leagues originally only included teams within the University of London. Now they include University teams from the London area that are not in UoL. The governance of these is carried out by Sports Officers from the Universities and Colleges Students' Unions that have at least one sports team in the league. The sports leagues are also supported by the Friends of University of London Sport, whose members were former Sports Officers from within the University of London.\n\nThe union was home to Central London's largest swimming pool.\n\nIn 2015, the UL Athletics and XC club established the London Colleges Athletics Series (LCAS) along with King's College London, University College London and Imperial College London. LCAS has since merged with the long-standing London Colleges League to form the London Universities and Colleges Athletics.\n\n"}

The affair has been seen as a precursor of the French Revolution.\nLa Chalotais was born on March 6, 1701, in Rennes.\n\nFor 60 years, he was the general procurer (') at the parliament of Brittany. He was an ardent opponent of the Jesuits and drew up two memoirs on their constitutions (') in 1761 and 1762 that did much to secure the suppression of the Order in France. The next year, he published his \"Essay on National Education\" (\"\"), which was extravagantly praised by Voltaire, in which he proposed a scientific programme of study to replace that previously offered by the Jesuits.\n\nThe same year began the conflict between the Estates of Brittany and the governor of the province, the duc d'Aiguillon. The Estates refused to vote the extraordinary imposts demanded by the governor in the name of the king. La Chalotais was the personal enemy of d'Aiguillon, who had served him an ill turn with the king, and when the parlement of Brittany sided with the Estates, he took the lead in its opposition. The parlement forbade by decrees the levy of imposts to which the Estates had not consented. The king annulling these decrees, all the members of the parlement but twelve resigned (October 1764 to May 1765). The government considered La Chalotais one of the authors of this affair.\n\nAt this time the secretary of state who administered the affairs of the province, Louis Phélypeaux, duc de la Vrilliere, comte de Saint-Florentin, received two anonymous and abusive letters. La Chalotais was suspected of having written them, and three experts in handwriting declared that they were by him. The government therefore arrested him, his son and four other members of the parliament. The arrest made a great sensation. There was much talk of \"despotism\". Voltaire stated that the procureur general, in his prison of Saint Malo, was reduced, for lack of ink, to write his defence with a toothpick dipped in vinegar. Apparently, this was pure legend, but public opinion all over France was strongly aroused against the government.\n\nOn November 16, 1765 a commission of judges was named to take charge of the trial. La Chalotais maintained that the trial was illegal; being procureur general he claimed the right to be judged by the parliament of Rennes, or failing this by the parliament of Bordeaux, according to the custom of the province. The judges did not dare to pronounce a condemnation on the evidence of experts in handwriting, and at the end of a year, things remained where they were at the first. Louis XV then decided on a sovereign act, and brought the affair before his council, which without further formality decided to send the accused into exile.\n\nLouis's expedient only increased the popular agitation; \"philosophes\", members of the parliament, Breton patriots and Jansenists all declared that La Chalotais was the victim of the personal hatred of the duc d'Aiguillon and of the Jesuits. The government at last gave way, and consented to recall the members of the parliament of Brittany who had resigned. This parliament, when it met again, after the formal accusation of the duc d'Aiguillon, demanded the recall of La Chalotais. This was accorded in 1775, and La Chalotais was allowed to transmit his office to his son. In this affair public opinion showed itself stronger than the absolutism of the king. The opposition to the royal power gained largely through it, and it may be regarded as one of the preludes to the revolution of 1789.\n\nLa Chalotais, who was personally a violent, haughty, and unsympathetic character, died at Rennes on July 12, 1785.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826321", "title": "Thomas Ashwell", "text": "Thomas Ashwell\n\nThomas Ashwell or Ashewell (c. 1478 – after 1513 (possibly 1527?)) was an English composer of the Renaissance. He was a skilled composer of polyphony, and may have been the teacher of John Taverner.\n\nHis admission to St. George's Chapel as a chorister in 1491 suggests a birthdate of approximately 1478, but nothing else is known about his early life. He stayed at St. George's until 1493, and account records at Tattershall College in Lincolnshire list him as a singer there in 1502 and 1503. He was in a position of authority at Lincoln Cathedral in 1508, according to records there, and was employed at Durham Cathedral as Cantor or Master of the singing boys, and to provide music for the Lady Chapel, in 1513; no further records survive of his life. The Durham Cathedral archives show the first successor to his duties there as being a William Robson, who began his duties in 1527, and this may be an indication of Ashwell's death some time before that.\n\nOnly scattered remnants of Ashwell's music survive. As was common for pre-Reformation music in England in Latin, the large majority of manuscripts were destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII (and a large proportion of English-language sacred music was destroyed during the subsequent reign of Mary, during her attempt to re-impose Roman Catholicism on the island). Two masses, both for six voices, survive complete in the \"Forrest-Heyther Partbooks,\" the first layer of which were copied for Taverner's use at Cardinal College in 1526-1530. With the fall of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529 the college founded by him was not able to devote resources to such music and so the manuscript was discontinued, and this situation was probably the reason for Taverner's departure that year. This first layer contains the \"Missa Jesu Christe\" (for 6 voices) and ten other works by various composers, including Taverner. The other Mass-setting (\"Missa Ave Maria\", also for 6 voices, which is the finer of the two and an outstanding work with similarities to Taverner's Missa \"Gloria tibi Trinitas\") was copied into the partbooks mid-century along with five other settings by other composers, though the dates of composition of both Ashwell Masses were considerably earlier: their style indicates dates of composition possibly even before his appointment at Durham. A few other works survive in other sources, mostly very fragmentary, including a fragment of a Mass for St. Cuthbert, which must date from his time at Durham. A song, \"She may be callyd a sovrant lady\", printed in a 1530 collection, is Ashwell's only surviving secular composition.\n\nThe connection with John Taverner as his possible teacher is tenuous but suggestive. The unsubstantiated suggestion has long existed that Taverner was a chorister at Tattershall, and should this have been the case he would have been there at the same time as Ashwell. Taverner seems to have at least been very familiar with the two Ashwell Masses, as he appears to have used them as models for his own (if the apparent dating is not incorrect, and Ashwell based his on Taverner's). A personal connection with Ashwell would account for the inclusion of his Masses in the \"Forrest-Heyther Partbooks,\" copied either by Taverner or for him when he became head of music at Cardinal College, Oxford in 1526. The first layer of the \"Forrest-Heyther Partbooks\" is headed by Taverner's own Mass \"Gloria tibi Trinitas\" (which seems to have much in common with Ashwell's Missa \"Ave Maria\") in six voices, and the only other six-part Mass in this layer is Ashwell's \"Jesu Christe,\" all the other works in this first layer being for only five voices (however, the piece immediately following \"Gloria tibi Trinitas\" is the hexachord Mass by Avery/Davy Burton: but although there are only five parts in the partbooks, it seems that a sixth part was unintentionally omitted). These partbooks contain generally rather newer music than that of Ashwell, and his inclusion would be typical of a student-teacher relationship.\n\nHowever, it may equally go some way to explaining Ashwell's presence in the \"Forrest-Heyther Partbooks\" to recall that the partbooks were compiled for Cardinal Wolsey's new college, and that Wolsey was also Bishop of Durham earlier in his career, and many of the composers had connections to institutions which had connections to Wolsey. It could be that the partbooks were also meant to act as a kind of survey in homage of the most important composers from many of Wolsey's dioceses.\n\nAshwell's reputation survived at least until the end of the 16th century, since Thomas Morley listed him as an authority in his 1597 treatise \"A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke.\"\n\n\n"}

The initial convention centers chosen for North Dakota and South Dakota were Bismarck and Sioux Falls respectively, but the latter was later changed to the city of Pierre. \nLegal residents of all of the above-mentioned territories were now permitted voting rights for state representatives, as well as the right to choose delegates who organized political conventions in their respective states. Soon after the Enabling Act was passed, each of the newly formed states was to hold an election for congressional representatives, and submit their results by the fifteenth of April, 1889. Montana, Washington, and North Dakota were all entitled to one representative in the United States House of Representatives at the time of the bill’s passing, while South Dakota was allowed two due to its higher population. \nThe North Dakota constitution was built and structured in a less complex manner than that of South Dakota’s. Every delegate from the southern state was to present a ballot reading either \"For the Sioux Falls constitution\" or \"Against the Sioux Falls constitution.\" If the latter was the majority, the constitution would be revised and resubmitted until the majority of delegates agreed on its passing. \nStatehood of North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, and Montana also included religious tolerance, stating that no inhabitant of any of the above states can be harassed on account of their religion and/or religious beliefs. However, while religious tolerance was mandated, all public land in the territories of the now-states was to be become government property (including Indian reservations and unclaimed land).\nThe newly formed states were expected to pay off the debts of their respective territories, and in return, the federal government would provide education and maintain public schooling systems in the mentioned states. Schools were expected to be open to all children and free of bigotry or discrimination. All land planned for use for public education was to be sold at no less than ten dollars per acre, and all money was to go to a public school fund, and the money would be used to build an education system. No private companies or individuals were entitled to the land, as it was now property of the federal government. \nNorth and South Dakota representatives were to assemble at a joint convention in Bismarck, North Dakota, to decide the borderline between the two states. Other items on the agenda that were to be split between the two states were public records, territory debt, and property. Each state was expected to pay for its share of the debts, as though they belonged solely to that state and were not previously shared with a territory.\n"}

The alpha particles emitted by the decay of the americium collide with the light beryllium nuclei, producing fast neutrons. When these fast neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei present in the soil being studied, they lose much of their energy. The detection of slow neutrons returning to the probe allows an estimate of the amount of hydrogen present. Since water contains two atoms of hydrogen per molecule, this therefore gives a measure of soil moisture. \n\nFarmers use this to determine how much water is in their fields. \n\nThis was first developed in 1950's.

Simmons was motivated by the 1973 energy crisis to create an investment banking firm catering to oil companies. He served as an energy adviser to U.S. President George W. Bush and was a member of the National Petroleum Council and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSimmons, who lived in Houston, Texas, died at his vacation home in North Haven, Maine, on August 8, 2010, at the age of 67. The death was ruled \"accidental drowning with heart disease a contributing factor\".\n\nSimmons was the author of the book \"Twilight in the Desert\", published in 2005. His examination of oil reserve decline rates helped raise awareness of the unreliability of Middle East oil reserves. He gave numerous presentations on peak oil and water shortages.\n\nSimmons believed that the Club of Rome's report, \"The Limits to Growth\", is more accurate than usually acknowledged.\n\nSimmons was the founder of the Ocean Energy Institute in Maine. His vision was to make Maine a leader in energy from offshore wind and ocean forces. The Ocean Energy Institute ceased operations in 2011.\n\nIn his book, Simmons argues that production from Saudi Arabia and especially from Ghawar—the world's largest oil field—will peak in the near future, if it has not done so already. Simmons bases his case on hundreds of internal documents from Saudi Aramco, professional journals and other authoritative sources. However, by 2016, Saudi production had increased by more than one million barrels per day.\n\nIn August 2005, Simmons bet John Tierney and Rita Simon, the widow of Julian Simon, $2500 each that the price of oil averaged over the entire calendar year of 2010 would be at least $200 per barrel (in 2005 dollars). Simmons would have lost this bet by a very wide margin: 2010 average oil prices did not even reach $100. The world-wide economic collapse created demand destruction that greatly decreased the demand for oil, causing prices to fall.\n\nSimmons made contributions to the films \"Peak Oil – Imposed by Nature\", \"\" (2006), \"The End of Suburbia\", \"Crude Impact\", and \"\", and appeared on World Energy Television \"World Energy Video Interview, August 2008\"\n\nSimmons made several controversial comments and predictions regarding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and BP's solvency, including:\n\n\nThe Guardian reported that Simmons was mentioned in a leaked U.S State Department cable dated November 2007:\n\nCOMMENT: While al-Husseini believes that Saudi officials overstate capabilities in the interest of spurring foreign investment, he is also critical of international expectations. He stated that the IEA's expectation that Saudi Arabia and the Middle East will lead the market in reaching global output levels of over 100 million barrels/day is unrealistic, and it is incumbent upon political leaders to begin understanding and preparing for this \"inconvenient truth.\" Al-Husseini was clear to add that he does not view himself as part of the \"peak oil camp,\" and does not agree with analysts such as Matthew Simmons. He considers himself optimistic about the future of energy, but pragmatic with regards to what resources are available and what level of production is possible. While he fundamentally contradicts the Aramco company line, al-Husseini is no doomsday theorist. His pedigree, experience and outlook demand that his predictions be thoughtfully considered.\n\nSimmons was found dead on August 8, 2010, in his hot tub. An autopsy by the state medical examiner's office the next day concluded that he died from accidental drowning with heart disease as a contributing factor.\n\n\n\n"}

It emerged from a split in the original Communist Party of Nepal in 1962. The Communist Party of Nepal had been ravaged by internal conflicts, due to the Sino-Soviet split and differences of how to relate to political changes in the country.\n\nIn April 1962 the radical sector of the Communist Party of Nepal convened a 3rd party convention in Varanasi, India. But the preparation of the congress had been full of controversy. The congress approved the programme of National Democratic Revolution proposed by Tulsi Lal Amatya, and elected Tulsi Lal as general secretary. In an attempt to maintain the unity of the party, Pushpa Lal Shrestha and Tulsi Lal were to share central leadership responsibilities. Keshar Jung Rayamjhi, the leader of the pro-Soviet faction of CPN was expelled. However, the Rayamajhi-led section did not recognize the convention. Rayamjhi's followers continued to function as a separate party, also using the name Communist Party of Nepal.\n\nHowever, between Amatya and Pushpa Lal there were political differences. Amatya favoured the idea of 'National Democracy' whereas Pushpa Lal advocated the line of 'People's Democracy'. From 1963 onwards, the two worked separately. In 1968 the section of Pushpa Lal organized a separate convention in Gorakhpur, India. This led to the founding of a separate party, with Pushpa Lal as general secretary. The majority of the party leadership followed Pushpa Lal in joining his splinter group. This party became known as Communist Party of Nepal (Pushpa Lal).\n\nIn 1971 a group of CPN leaders (Manmohan Adhikari, Shambhu Ram and Mohan Bikram Singh) were released from jail. They formed the Central Nucleus, which tried to unify with Pushpa Lal's group. That unity proved impossible and the Central Nucleus gave way to new parties. Adhikari formed his own CPN, Communist Party of Nepal (Manmohan). This party developed close relations to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). Singh's group became known as Communist Party of Nepal (Fourth Convention).\n\nThe Amatya-led Communist Party was reduced to become one of many clandestine communist factions in Nepal, and it was readily outgrown by several of its splinter groups. The party was generally identified as part of the pro-Soviet Union stream within the Nepalese communist movement, although it maintained some independence towards Moscow.\n\nIn 1989 the party took part in the formation of the United Left Front, to struggle against the autocratic regime. Following the overthrow of the regime and the democratic opening, the party contested the 1991 parliamentary election. The party put up 14 candidates, who together mustered 4846 votes. None of the candidates of the party were elected.\n\nSoon after the 1991 general election the party had merged itself with two other groups to form the Communist Party of Nepal (United). However, that unity turned short-lived. Tulsi Lal Amatya broke away from CPN (United) and reconstituted his own party. In 1994 CPN (Amatya) joined the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).\n\n"}
{"id": "1826352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826352", "title": "Avital Ronell", "text": "Avital Ronell\n\nAvital Ronell (; born 15 April 1952) is an American academic who writes about continental philosophy, literary studies, psychoanalysis, political philosophy, and ethics. She is a professor in the humanities and in the departments of Germanic languages and literature and comparative literature at New York University, where she co-directs the trauma and violence transdisciplinary studies program.\n\nAs Jacques Derrida Professor of Philosophy, Ronell teaches at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee. She has written about such topics as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone; the structure of the test in legal, pharmaceutical, artistic, scientific, Zen, and historical domains; stupidity; the disappearance of authority; childhood; and deficiency. Ronell is a founding editor of the journal \"Qui Parle\" and a member of Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nAn eleven-month investigation at New York University determined that Ronell sexually harassed a graduate student, and the university suspended her without pay for the 2018–2019 academic year.\n\nAvital Ronell was born in Prague to Israeli diplomats and was a performance artist before entering academia. She emigrated to New York in 1956. She attended Rutgers Preparatory School and graduated in 1970. As a young immigrant, Ronell later stated, she frequently encountered xenophobia and anti-Semitism. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from Middlebury College, and subsequently studied with Jacob Taubes and Hans-Georg Gadamer at the Hermeneutic Institute at the Free University of Berlin. She received her doctorate of philosophy in German studies at Princeton University in 1979, where her advisor was Stanley Corngold and her dissertation concerned self-reflection in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Franz Kafka. When she met Jacques Derrida at a symposium and he asked her name, she introduced herself as \"Metaphysics\", and he later wrote that he \"found this little game rather clever.\" She subsequently studied with Derrida and Hélène Cixous in Paris. She went on to help introduce Derrida to American audiences by translating his essay on Kafka's \"Before the Law\", his essay on the law of gender/genre, his lectures on Nietzsche's relation to biography, and a number of other works. Ronell became a close friend of poet and novelist Pierre Alféri, who later influenced Ronell in the titling of several of her major works.\n\nA professor at the University of Virginia for a short time period, Ronell claims she was fired because she taught continental philosophy and \"went to the gym on a regular basis: [her] colleagues were shocked by this—it didn't correspond to their image of an academic woman!\" She joined the comparative literature faculty at the University of California, Riverside and then at University of California, Berkeley where she taught with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Jean-Luc Nancy and Judith Butler. She was a close friend of the writer Kathy Acker and identified with Acker's fiction, saying they were \"destined to each other.\" In 1996, she moved to New York University, where she co-taught a course with Jacques Derrida until 2004.\n\nIn 2009, the Centre Pompidou invited Ronell to hold an interview series with such artists and thinkers as Werner Herzog, Judith Butler, Dennis Cooper, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Suzanne Doppelt. Also in 2009, she began co-teaching courses with Slavoj Žižek. In 2010, François Noudelmann also co-taught with her, and co-curated the Walls and Bridges program with her in 2011.\n\nRonell served as Chair to the Division of Philosophy and Literature and to the Division of Comparative Literature at the Modern Language Association from 1993 to 1996, and gave a keynote address at the annual meeting of the American Comparative Literature Association in 2012.\n\nRonell argues for \"the necessity of the unintelligible.\" In an account of the 1992 Rodney King beating, Ronell argued that the idiom of the \"perfectly clear\" recurrently serves as a code for the white lie. Instead of referring to herself as the author of a text, she has sometimes described herself as a \"signatory,\" \"operator,\" or even \"television.\" She sometimes focuses on thinkers who clean up after other thinkers, arguing that what she calls \"sanitation departments\" sometimes undermine the work they are tidying up after.\n\nRonell investigates one of Goethe's most influential works, \"Conversations with Eckermann\", which he did not write but instead dictated to a young schizoid companion, Johannes Peter Eckermann. Heralded by Nietzsche as \"the best German book,\" \"Conversations with Eckermann\" contains Goethe's last thoughts about art, poetry, politics, religion, and the fate of German literature and philosophy. Ronell reads \"Conversations with Eckermann\" as a return from beyond the grave of the great master of German literature and science.\n\nRonell starts by exploring Goethe's focus on \"a certain domain of immateriality—the nonsubstantializable apparitions ... [of] weather forecasting ... ghosts, dreams, and some forms of hidden, telepathic transmissions.\" Ronell renames the Goethe-effect what she calls \"killer texts\" and describes the effect as the textual machination destructive of values, of the \"worthier (\"Werther\", from \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\").\" The first part opens on Freud's debt to Goethe and reprints the frontispiece of \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.\" Ronell names Goethe the \"secret councilor (\"Geheimrat\")\" of Freud and already anticipates her work on the Rat Man in the third footnote where she alludes to the \"suppository logic, inserting the vital element into the narrative of the other.\" In the first section Ronell aims to \"attune [her] ears to the telepathic orders that Goethe's phantom transmitted to Freud by a remote control system.\n\nIn general, \"Dictations: On Haunted Writing\" traces the closure without end of influence's computation. Ronell's task entails a reading practice where the analysis of a text must investigate the endless movement towards closure in dictation. Ronell thus practices what is called anasemic reading, a practice developed by Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok, in which the psychoanalyst traces the textual metaphors, rhetorical structures, and linguistic associations of a writer/patient.\n\n\"Part Two\" presents a case of literary parasitism between Eckermann and Goethe, and opens at the scene of Goethe's table in Weimar \"the eleventh of September 1828, at two o'clock.\" In other words, Ronell re-imagines the scene that Eckermann illustrates at the beginning and ending of \"Conversations with Eckermann\". Ronell starts to address the fiction of the writer as a particularly admirable human being and argues for the necessary passivity of the writer as a human being. Ronell also troubles the notion of a body of work as a totality. Ronell remaps earlier arguments about feminine appropriation in terms of writing, for Eckermann, which \"involves recuperating something 'for myself,' for the most part instinctively; it entails repetitive acts of appropriation.\"\n\n\"Dictations: On Haunted Writing\" explores how the work of writing in general adheres to a call dictated from elsewhere, a call formative of desire.\n\nRonell questions the operations that such ordinary objects as the telephone and book dictate. She signs the text as the operator of the switchboard alongside Richard Eckersley, operator of design, and Michael Jensen, operator of compositor. Eckersley's design departs from his \"typographic subtlety and restraint\" towards a computer design, marked by new page-making software programs to interpret the text typographically. Eckersley dislodges the text from presumed conventional settings and shifts the focus of reading with inexplicable gaps, displacements between sentences and paragraphs, mirror imaging of pages facing one another, words blurred to the point of indecipherability, and a regular exaggeration of negative line spacing, spilling sentences over into each other. Pushing the limits of an ordinary \"Table of Contents\" or \"Footnotes,\" the operators set up a \"Directory Assistance,\" in which chapters appear as reference indexes, and a yellow pages entitled \"Classified,\" in which footnotes appear as soliciting advertisements.\n\nFollowing \"A User's Manual,\" the text begins as if the reader answers a call: \"And yet, you're saying yes, almost automatically, suddenly, sometimes irreversibly.\" Ronell makes clear that \"The Telephone Book\" is a philosophical project on questions concerning the telephone, the call, and the answering machines: \"always incomplete, always unreachable, forever promising at once its essence and its existence, philosophy identifies itself finally with this promise, which is to say, with its own unreachability.\"\n\nRonell takes as her point of departure Nietzsche's position that, as long as culture has existed, it has supported and inspired addiction. She develops an argument investigating destructive desires that coincide with the war on drugs and with the very addiction to drugs which the war claims to want to vanquish. The text intends to disturb simple comprehension of drugs on one side or another of a binary opposition.\n\nResearch assistant and friend, Shireen R.K. Patell, helped bring \"Finitude's Score\" to fruition. \"Finitude's Score\" collects a series of reflections on the fragile memory left at the close of the millennium. It looks into the projects responsible for devastating humanity and a thinking of the future. Ronell asks why the twentieth century stakes so much on a diction of deficiency. For Ronell, it says that, \"we have been depleted.\" Ronell traces the relegitimization of war, the philosophical status of the rumor, the questionable force of the police, the test sites of technology, the corporeal policies of disease and a thoroughgoing reconstitution of the subject of law. In sum, \"Finitude's Score\" reads the desire to finish once and for all, to be done with issues definitively, as the everlasting legacy of the Western logos.\n\nRonell's work has been both praised and criticized. In 1994, the journal \"Diacritics\" published a special edition \"On the Work of Avital Ronell\", in which Jonathan Culler wrote: \"Over the past decade, Ronell has put together what must be one of the most remarkable critical oeuvres of our era ... Zeugmatically yoking the slang of pop culture with philosophical analysis, forcing the confrontation of high literature and technology or drug culture, Avital Ronell produces sentences that startle, irritate, illuminate. At once hilarious and refractory, her books are like no others.\" Judith Butler has said she feels deeply indebted to Ronell's influence on her work and wrote in an edited collection \"Reading Ronell\": \"The different path that Ronell takes is precisely the path of difference: gay, difficult, affirmative, ironic.\" The collection's editor Diane Davis highlighted the \"singular provocation of Ronell's 'remarkable critical oeuvre,'\" \"the devastating insights, the unprecedented writing style, the relentless destabilizations.\" In the sixth session of \"The Beast and the Sovereign\" on February 6 of 2002, Jacques Derrida devoted special attention to Ronell's \"Stupidity\" and commends the untranslatable complexity of her \"irony.\"\n\nBy contrast, in a 1990 review of \"The Telephone Book\" for the \"New York Times Book Review,\" novelist Robert Coover appreciated the \"visual pyrotechnics\" of the book's typography but found \"the argument… to be that of a fairly conventional academic paper, recognizably party-lined with fashionable Continental voices like Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida,\" and found the connection that Ronell tried to establish between Heidegger, schizophrenia, and the telephone \"weak.\" In a 2002 review of \"Stupidity\" for the \"Times Literary Supplement,\" philosopher Jonathan Rée said Ronell's \"prose reads like a plodding translation of a French version of Heidegger, but there is hardly a sentence that does not try to stop the show to receive an ovation for its cleverness.\" Bernd Hüppauf (former chair of the German department at NYU who hired Ronell but was later replaced by her) similarly described her work as \"translating incomprehensibility into pseudo-profundity.\"\n\nIn September 2017, a student, later identified as her male former graduate student Nimrod Reitman, filed a complaint in New York University's Title IX office, accusing Ronell of sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and retaliation over the span of three years as her advisee. In May 2018, the university found Ronell responsible for sexual harassment and suspended her for the 2018–19 academic year. Ronell has not admitted any of the claims made in Reitman's complaint. On August 16, 2018, Reitman filed a lawsuit against Ronell and the university, alleging sexual harassment, sexual assault, and stalking.\n\nA letter to NYU in defense of Ronell signed by major figures in the areas of feminism, philosophy, literature and history, including Judith Butler, Slavoj Žižek, Joan Scott and Jean-Luc Nancy, dated May 11, 2018, was leaked. The letter has been criticized for suggesting that Ronell should be excused on the basis of the significance of her academic contributions and for imputing a \"malicious intention\" to Reitman. The #MeToo movement came under scrutiny as prominent feminist scholars continued to support Ronell, despite the charges of sexual misconduct. Butler later regretted some wording of the letter, while Žižek argues that Ronell's conducts are acts of eccentricity, rather than sexual harassments. Providing historical and institutional context, an article in the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\" argued that Ronell's inappropriate conduct was intimately linked to the power that she wields within the humanities as a \"Theory star.\" \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" published an essay by Andrea Long Chu describing her experiences as a teaching assistant for Ronell at NYU, stating that based on those experiences, she believes Reitman's allegations.\n\nRonell returned to teaching at NYU in the fall of 2019. Her course, \"Unsettled Scores: Theories of Grievance, Stuckness, & Boundary Troubles\" was advertised on campus with a flyer asking: \"How have we secretly internalized penitentiary structures?\" Ronell's return caused outcries from the student government at NYU.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Historians' estimates for her total victories range from five to twelve solo victories and two to four shared kills in her 66 combat sorties. In about two years of operations, she was the first female fighter pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft, the first of two female fighter pilots who have earned the title of fighter ace and the holder of the record for the greatest number of kills by a female fighter pilot. She was shot down near Orel during the Battle of Kursk as she attacked a formation of German aircraft.\n\nLydia Litvyak was born in Moscow into a Russian family. Her mother Anna Vasilievna Litvyak was a shop assistant, her father Vladimir Leontievich Litvyak (1892–1937) worked as a railwayman, train driver and clerk; during the Great Purge he was arrested as an \"enemy of the people\" and disappeared. Lydia became interested in aviation at an early age. At 14, she enrolled in a flying club. She performed her first solo flight at 15, and later graduated at Kherson military flying school. She became a flight instructor at Kalinin Airclub, and by the time the German-Soviet war broke out, had already trained 45 pilots.\n\nAfter the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Litvyak tried to join a military aviation unit, but was turned down because of lack of experience. After deliberately exaggerating her pre-war flight time by 100 hours, she joined the all-female 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Air Defense Force, which was formed by Marina Raskova. She trained there on the Yakovlev Yak-1 aircraft.\nLitvyak flew her first combat flights in the summer of 1942 over Saratov. In September, she was assigned to the 437 Fighter Regiment, a men's regiment fighting over Stalingrad. On 10 September she moved along with Yekaterina Budanova, Mariya Kuznetsova and Raisa Beliaeva, the commander of the group, and accompanying female ground crew, to the regiment airfield, at Verkhnaia Akhtuba, on the east bank of the Volga river. But when they arrived the base was empty and under attack, so they soon moved to Srednaia Akhtuba. Here, flying a Yak-1 carrying the number \"32\" on the fuselage, she would achieve considerable success. Boris Yeremin (later lieutenant general of aviation), a regimental commander in the division to which she and Budanova were assigned, saw her as \"a very aggressive person\" and \"a born fighter pilot\".\n\nIn the 437th Fighter Regiment, Litvyak scored her first two kills on 13 September, three days after her arrival and on her third mission to cover Stalingrad, becoming the first woman fighter pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft. That day, four Yak-1s—with Major S. Danilov in the lead—attacked a formation of Junkers Ju 88s escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Her first kill was a Ju 88 which fell in flames from the sky after several bursts. Then she shot down a Bf 109 G-2 \"Gustav\" on the tail of her squadron commander, Raisa Beliaeva. The Bf 109 was piloted by a decorated pilot from the 4th Air Fleet, the 11-victory ace Staff Sergeant Erwin Maier of the 2nd Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 53. Maier parachuted from his aircraft, was captured by Soviet troops, and asked to see the Russian ace who had shot him down. When he was taken to Litvyak, he thought he was being made the butt of a Soviet joke. It was not until Litvyak described each move of the fight to him in perfect detail that he knew he had been shot down by a woman pilot. But according to other authors, the first air victory by a female pilot was achieved by Lieutenant Valeriya Khomyakova of the 586th Regiment when she shot down the Ju 88 flown by \"Oblt.\" Gerhard Maak of 7./KG76 on the night of 24 September 1942.\n\nOn 14 September, according to some authors, Litvyak shot down another Bf 109. Her victim was probably Knight's Cross holder and 71-kill \"experte\" \"Lt.\" Hans Fuss (Adj.II./JG-3), injured in aerial combat with a Yak-1 on 14 September 1942 in Stalingrad area, when his G-2 fuel tank was hit, his plane somersaulted during the landing when he ran out of fuel flying back to base. He was critically injured, lost one leg and died of his wounds 10 November 1942. On 27 September, Litvyak scored an air victory against a Ju 88, the gunner having shot up the regiment commander, Major M.S. Khovostnikov. Possibly Ju 88A-4 \"5K + LH\" of Iron Cross holder \"Oblt.\" Johann Wiesniewski, 2./KG 3, MIA with all crew members. Some historians credit it as her first kill.\nLitvyak, Beliaeva, Budanova and Kuznetsova stayed in the 437th Regiment for a short time only, mainly because it was equipped with LaGG 3s rather than Yak-1s, that the women flew, and was lacking the facilities to service the latter. So the four women were moved to the 9th Guards Fighter Regiment. From October 1942 till January 1943, Litvyak and Budanova served, still in the Stalingrad area, with this famous unit, commanded by Lev Shestakov, Hero of Soviet Union.\n\nIn January 1943, the 9th was re-equipped with the Bell P-39 Airacobras and Litvyak and Budanova were moved to the 296th Fighter Regiment (later redesignated as the 73rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment) of Nikolai Baranov, of the 8th Air Army, so that they could still fly the Yaks. On February 23, she was awarded the Order of the Red Star, made a junior lieutenant and selected to take part in the elite air tactic called \"okhotniki\", or \"free hunter\", where pairs of experienced pilots searched for targets on their own initiative. Twice, she was forced to land due to battle damage. On 22 March she was wounded for the first time. That day she was flying as part of a group of six Yak fighters when they attacked a dozen Ju 88s. Litvyak shot down one of the bombers but was in turn attacked and wounded by the escorting Bf 109s. She managed to shoot down a Messerschmitt and to return to her airfield and land her plane, but was in severe pain and losing blood. While in 73rd Regiment, she often flew as wingman of Captain Aleksey Solomatin, a flying ace with a claimed total of 39 victories (22 shared). On May 21, while training a new flyer, Solomatin was killed in front of the entire regiment in Pavlonka when he flew into the ground. Litvyak was devastated by the crash and wrote a letter to her mother describing how she realized only after Solomatin's death that she had loved him.\n\nSenior Sergeant Inna Pasportnikova, Litvyak's mechanic during the time she flew with the men's regiment, reported in 1990 that after Solomatin's death, Litvyak wanted nothing but to fly combat missions, and she fought desperately.\n\nLitvyak scored against a difficult target on 31 May 1943: an artillery observation balloon manned by a German officer. German artillery was aided in targeting by reports from the observation post on the balloon. The elimination of the balloon had been attempted by other Soviet airmen but all had been driven away by a dense protective belt of anti-aircraft fire defending the balloon. Litvyak volunteered to take out the balloon but was turned down. She insisted and described for her commander her plan: she would attack it from the rear after flying in a wide circle around the perimeter of the battleground and over German-held territory. The tactic worked—the hydrogen-filled balloon caught fire under her stream of tracer bullets and was destroyed.\n\nOn 13 June1943, Litvyak was appointed flight commander of the 3rd Aviation Squadron within 73rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment.\n\nLitvyak made an additional kill on 16 July 1943. That day, six Yaks encountered 30 German Ju 88 bombers with six escorts. The female ace downed a bomber and shared a victory with a comrade, but her fighter was hit and she had to make a belly landing. She was wounded again but refused to take medical leave. She shot down one Bf 109 on 19 July 1943, probably 6-kill ace \"Uffz.\" Helmuth Schirra, 4./JG-3 (MIA, Luhansk area). Another Bf 109 kill followed two days later on 21 July 1943, possibly Bf 109G-6 of Iron Cross holder and 28-kill \"experte Lt.\" Hermann Schuster 4./JG-3(KIA, near Pervomaysk, Luhansk area).\n\nOn August 1, 1943, Litvyak did not come back to her base at Krasnyy Luch. It was her fourth sortie of the day, escorting a flight of Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft. As the Soviets were returning to base near Orel, a pair of Bf 109 fighters dove on Litvyak while she was attacking a large group of German bombers. Soviet pilot Ivan Borisenko recalled: “Lily just didn’t see the Messerschmitt 109s flying cover for the German bombers. A pair of them dove on her and when she did see them she turned to meet them. Then they all disappeared behind a cloud.” Borisenko, involved in the dogfight, saw her the last time, through a gap in the clouds, her Yak-1 pouring smoke and pursued by as many as eight Bf 109s.\n\nBorisenko descended to see if he could find her. No parachute was seen, and no explosion, yet she never returned from the mission. Litvyak was 21 years old. Soviet authorities suspected that she might have been captured, a possibility that prevented them from awarding her the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nTwo German pilots are believed to have shot down Litvyak: Iron Cross holder and 30-kill \"experte Fw.\" Hans-Jörg Merkle of \"1./JG.52\", Knight's Cross holder and future 99-kill \"experte Lt\", or Hans Schleef, of \"7./JG 3\". Merkle is the only pilot that claimed a Yak-1 near Dmitryevka on 1 August 1943, his 30th victory. (Dmitrijewka is where she was last seen and was – reportedly – buried.) This occurred before being rammed and killed by his own victim (Luftwaffe combat report of collision: 3 km east of Dmitrievka). While Schleef claimed a LaGG-3 (often confused in combat with Yak-1s by German pilots) kill on the same day, in the South-Ukraine area where Litvyak's aircraft was at last found.\n\nIn an attempt to prove that Litvyak had not been taken captive, Pasportnikova embarked on a 36-year search for the Yakovlev Yak-1 crash site assisted by the public and the media. For three years she was joined by relatives who together combed the most likely areas with a metal detector. In 1979, after uncovering more than 90 other crash sites, 30 aircraft and many lost pilots killed in action, \"the searchers discovered that an unidentified woman pilot had been buried in the village of Dmitrievka... in Shakhterski district.\" It was then assumed that it was Litvyak and that she had been killed in action after sustaining a mortal head wound. Pasportnikova said that a special commission was formed to inspect the exhumed body and it concluded the remains were those of Litvyak.\n\nOn 6 May 1990, USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev posthumously awarded her the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Her final rank was senior lieutenant, as documented in all Moscow newspapers of that date.\n\nArguments have been published that dispute the official version of Litvyak's death. Although Yekaterina Valentina Vaschenko, the curator of the Litvyak museum in Krasnyi Luch has stated that the body was disinterred and examined by forensic specialists, who determined that it was indeed Litvyak, Kazimiera Janina Cottam claims, on the basis of evidence provided by Yekaterina Polunina, chief mechanic and archivist of the 586th Fighter Regiment in which Litvyak initially served, that the body was never exhumed and that verification was limited to comparison of a number of reports. Cottam, an author and researcher focusing on Soviet women in the military, concludes that Litvyak made a belly-landing in her stricken aircraft, was captured and taken to a prisoner of war camp. In her book published in 2004, Polunina lists evidence that led her to conclude that Litvyak was pulled from the downed aircraft by German troops and held prisoner for some time.\n\nGian Piero Milanetti, author of a recent book about Soviet aviatrixes, wrote that an airwoman parachuted in the approximate location of the alleged crash landing of Litvyak's aircraft. No other Soviet airwomen operated in that area, so Milanetti believes the pilot was Litvyak, probably captured by the enemy. Russian aviation historian, Anatoly Plyac, former KGB major, told Milanetti: \"Litvyak survived and was taken prisoner...\"\nA television broadcast from Switzerland was seen in 2000 by Raspopova, a veteran of the women's night bomber regiment. It featured a former Soviet woman fighter pilot who Raspopova thought may have been Litvyak. This veteran was wounded twice. Married outside of the Soviet Union, she had three children. Raspopova promptly told Polunina what she inferred from the Swiss broadcast.\n\nThere is no consensus among historians about the number of aerial victories scored by Litvyak. Russian historians Andrey Simonov and Svetlana Chudinova were able to confirm five solo and three team shootdowns of enemy aircraft plus the destruction of the air ballon with archival documents. Various other tallies are attributed to her, including eleven solo and three shared plus the balloon, as well as eight individual and four team. Anne Noggle credits her with twelve individual and two team shootdowns. Pasportnikova stated in 1990 that the tally was eleven solo kills plus the balloon, and an additional three shared. Polunina has written that the kills of famous Soviet pilots, including those of Litvyak and Budanova, were often inflated; and that Litvyak should be credited with five solo aircraft kills and two group kills, including the observation balloon.\n\nLitvyak was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, Order of the Red Star, and was twice honored with the Order of the Patriotic War.\n\nLitvyak displayed a rebellious and romantic character. Returning from a successful mission, she would \"buzz\" the aerodrome and then indulge in unauthorised aerobatics, knowing that it enraged her commander.\n\nLitvyak could also be superstitious, as Paspotnikova testified:\n\nShe never believed that she was invincible. She believed that some pilots had luck on their side and others didn't. She firmly believed that, if you survived the first missions, the more you flew and the more experience you got your chances of making it would increase. But you had to have luck on your side.\nDespite the predominantly male environment in which she found herself, she never renounced her femininity, and would carry on dyeing her hair blonde, sending her friend Inna Pasportnikova to the hospital to fetch hydrogen peroxide for her. She would fashion scarves from parachute material, dyeing the small pieces in different colors and stitching them together and would not hide her love of flowers, which she picked at every available occasion, favoring red roses. She would make bouquets and keep them in the cockpit, which were promptly discarded by the male pilots who shared her aircraft\n\nHer comrade Solomatin is believed to have been her fiancé, and after his death, she wrote to her mother:\n\nYou see, he was not my type, but his insistence and his love for me convinced me to love him... and now, it seems I will never meet someone like him ever again.\nThe novel \"Vernis iz Poleta\" (\"Return from Flight\") by Natalya Kravtsova fictionalizes the death of Solomatin, stating that he was killed when he ran out of ammunition while battling with a German Bf 109 fighter plane over his own airfield. In this version, Litvyak and others at the airfield watched the fight and witnessed his death.\n\nLitvyak was called the \"White Lily of Stalingrad\" in Soviet press releases; the white lily flower may be translated from Russian as Madonna lily. She has also been called the \"White Rose of Stalingrad\" in Europe and North America since reports of her exploits were first published in English.\n\nLitvyak is the major character in Mary Ann Cook's romanticized novel \"The White Rose, \"a fictional account of her wartime experiences.\n\nA heavily fictionalized Litvyak (called Natasha in the book) is the main character of Belinda Alexandra's novel \"Sapphire Skies\" \n\nPerhaps the most detailed work of literary fiction about Litvyak, her life, times and loves, was written by an American, M.G. Crisci, with no Russian ancestry, in cooperation with Valentina Vaschenko, the curator of the Lilya Litvyak Museum and School in Krasny Luch, Eastern Ukraine. The book entitled \"Call Sign, White Lily,\" also contains never-before-seen photographs contributed by the museum.\nLitvyak posed as a model for Sanya V. Litvyak, a character in Strike Witches.\n\nIn Zap Comix #11 (February 1985), graphic artist Spain Rodriguez dramatizes the fighter pilot's story in a ten-page narrative: \"Lily Litvak, the Rose of Stalingrad.\" The work is also included in Rodriguez's 1995 Fantagraphics Books anthology, \"My True Story.\"\n\nIn the RPC Authority universe, Hellsverg (the pen name of Indra M. Pratama) wrote a fictionalized version of Litvyak, who was a rogue member of the RAVAAF.\n\nOn March 22, 2019, director Andrei Chaliop announced a film about Lydia Litvyak to be filmed in conjunction with director Kim Druzhinin and produced by the 28 Panfilov studio.\nIn July 2019 the Israeli Metal Band Desert Released a song named \"Fortune favors the brave\" about Lilly and her bravery in their album with the same name.\n\nThe play \"White Rose\" by Scottish playwright Peter Arnott portrays Litvyak's imagined political thoughts, with her character discussing war and Soviet women's resistance against Nazism. It was first performed on 22 May 1985 at the Edinburgh Festival, in the Traverse Theatre. Ken Stott and Tilda Swinton played the lead characters; the role helped advance Swinton's career. Swinton met her future husband John Byrne during the production. Byrne, also a playwright, served as the set designer for \"White Rose\".\n\nThere has been a production at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow in February–March 2013.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes Litvyak's credited victories and their fates:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1826356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826356", "title": "Ottokar Czernin", "text": "Ottokar Czernin\n\nOttokar Theobald Otto Maria \"Graf\" Czernin von und zu Chudenitz (; 26 September 1872 – 4 April 1932) was an Austro-Hungarian diplomat and politician during the time of World War I, notably serving as Foreign Minister from 1916 to 1918.\n\nCzernin was born in Dymokury () into an ancient Bohemian noble family (the Czernin family). In 1897, he married Marie \"née\" Gräfin Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1878–1945) in Heřmanův Městec (). His younger brother Otto was also a diplomat and served \"inter alia\" as envoy to Sofia during World War I.\n\nAfter studying law at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, he joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service in 1895 and was dispatched to the embassy in Paris. In 1899, he was sent to The Hague, but only three years later he had to resign as a result of a lung infection and retired to his Bohemian estates.\n\nIn 1903, Count von Czernin became a member of the Bohemian Lower House as a representative of the \"Deutsche Verfassungspartei\". He quickly became a champion of conservatism and a defender of 'monarchical principles' and favoured upholding the monarchy and opposing universal suffrage and parliamentarism. This brought him to the attention of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir apparent to the throne of the Dual Monarchy. As a leading member of Franz Ferdinand's so-called Belvedere Circle, Count von Czernin was appointed a member of the Austrian Upper House (\"Herrenhaus\") in 1912.\n\nAt the heir apparent's request, Count von Czernin re-entered the diplomatic corps in October 1913 when he was selected as minister to Bucharest. The appointment initially caused some controversy as he was considered a notorious Magyarophobe, but he managed to persuade the Hungarian Minister President Count Tisza to agree. However, an interview in a Hungarian newspaper in January 1914 nearly cost him his job with Hungarian calls for his resignation.\n\nAs minister to Bucharest, Count von Czernin's mission was to investigate the value of the alliance with Romania and the possibilities to strengthen it. However, he quickly reported back to Vienna that one could not trust the Romanian government if a war would break out. Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he strove successfully to keep Romania neutral, thanks in part to the support of the aged King Carol I. Most Romanians did not share Carol's strongly pro-German sentiments, including Prime Minister Brătianu and his government. Count von Czernin recommended that Vienna should offer the withdrawal of Siebenbürgen (now Transylvania) and parts of Bukovina in order to persuade Romania to prolong their neutrality, but the plan was strongly opposed by the Hungarian government. Romania entered the war on the side of the Allies in August 1916 and Count von Czernin returned to Vienna.\nFollowing the accession of Karl I as the new emperor, Count von Czernin was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on 23 December 1916, replacing Baron Burián von Rajecz. Both men shared the view that a rapid conclusion of peace was necessary to avoid the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire.\n\nCount von Czernin's main aim was therefore to seek a compromise peace while respecting the agreements made with Germany. However, he quickly discovered that the Dual Monarchy's increasing dependency on Germany rendered a truly independent foreign policy impossible. While he reluctantly agreed with the necessity of resuming unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, he spent much effort that year to unsuccessfully persuade German political and military leaders of the need for a peace by compromise.\n\nAt a conference between Germany and Austria-Hungary on 17–18 March 1917 on the goals of the war, he suggested inter alia the cession of territory of the Central Powers to arrange a fast peace with the Entente. In his view, the declaration of war by the United States was a disaster and a victory for the Central Powers became improbable. More precisely, he suggested that Germany should abandon Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium in return for large territorial gains in Poland. In Count von Czernin's scenario Austria-Hungary would be compensated with primarily Romanian territory.\nOn 12 April, he drafted a memorandum with a gloomy prognostication of Austria-Hungary's war situation that was transmitted through Emperor Karl I to Matthias Erzberger, a member of the German Reichstag, outlining the reasons why the Dual Monarchy could not survive another winter of fighting. This resulted in the well-meaning but ineffective peace resolution of 19 July 1917. In a speech in Budapest on 2 October 1917, he spoke in favour of international justice, disarmament, arbitration and freedom of the seas as a basis for peace and as a legal basis for a new Europe.\n\nFollowing the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, the workers across the Austro-Hungarian Empire became increasingly active around the issue of food shortages and a desire for a \"peace without annexations. This led to the 1918 Austro-Hungarian January Strike in which Czernin had to personally intervene. On 24 January 1918, he announced he accepted Wilson's Fourteen Points. He then negotiated a separate peace treaty with the newly created Ukrainian People's Republic that was signed on 9 February 1918 and in which he agreed to cede Chelm. The so-called bread peace did not solve the Dual Monarchy's food supply problem, but it did earn Count von Czernin the loathing of Austrian Poles, who also had claimed Chelm. He reached the highlight of his career by subsequently signing peace treaties with Russia on 3 March and Romania on 14 April and was considered the leading diplomat of the Central Powers.\n\nThe Sixtus Affair, however, led to Count von Czernin's downfall. Emperor Karl I, using his brother-in-law Prince Sixte of Bourbon-Parma as his intermediary, had secretly assured French President Poincaré by a letter dated 24 March 1917 that he would support France's \"just demand\" for the return of Alsace-Lorraine. Although his role in the affair remains unclear, he was aware of the secret negotiations, although not of the exact wording of the letter. When French Premier Clemenceau published the letter a year later Count von Czernin, feeling himself betrayed by Emperor Karl I and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, tendered his resignation on 14 April 1918.\n\nCount von Czernin has been relatively harshly judged by historians. While he was arguably more imaginative and energetic than either of his predecessors, Count von Berchtold or Baron Burián von Rajecz, he was at the same time more unpredictable and volatile, giving in to sudden impulses. This gave his foreign policy an element of instability, which possibly did not inspire confidence to the other side with which he was seeking a compromise peace. Despite being celebrated at the time as a \"peace minister\", his diplomatic efforts to disengage his country from World War I failed to prevent the dissolution of Austria-Hungary.\n\nAfter the war, the Czechoslovak agrarian reforms deprived him of his lands in Bohemia and he withdrew to Salzkammergut in Austria. From 1920 to 1923, he served as a deputy of the \"Demokratische Partei\" in the National Council of the Republic of Austria.\n\nIn 1917, he was bestowed with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen and invested as a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Apparently he wrote to Empress Zita after the war asking her not to expel him from the latter order because of his erratic behaviour as Foreign Minister.\n\nIn 1919, he published his memoirs of his days as an insider in the Austro-Hungarian political and diplomatic arenas during World War I, called \"In the World War\", an interesting look at the inside machinations of an ancient empire being pulled apart by war. In the book he suggested that future generation would remember the First World War as a prelude to world revolution.\n\nCount von Czernin died in Vienna on 4 April 1932.\n\nCount von Czernin was portrayed by actor Christopher Lee in an episode of American television series \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\". The episode was entitled \"Austria, March 1917\" and premiered on the ABC television network on 21 September 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in the US in October 1968 (Epic Records BN 26420 (stereo)), but not in the UK, because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Mellow Yellow\" from being released there. A songbook of lead sheets to the album was nonetheless issued in both countries.\n\nDonovan wrote and recorded much of \"The Hurdy Gurdy Man\" in late 1967, not long after recording the songs that would form \"A Gift from a Flower to a Garden\". The rest of \"The Hurdy Gurdy Man\" was recorded in April 1968, after he visited Rishikesh in India to study Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. John Lennon, Cynthia Lennon, George Harrison, Pattie Boyd, Paul McCartney, Jane Asher, Ringo Starr, Mia Farrow, Prudence Farrow and Mike Love were there as well. Harrison wrote a verse for \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" when they were in India, but it was cut from the studio version in order to ensure that the song was not overly long for a single. On his 1973 live album \"\" and his 1990 live album \"Rising\", Donovan explains the story and sings the previously omitted verse. The last verse of \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\", written by Harrison, is: \"When the truth gets buried deep / Beneath a thousand years of sleep / Time demands a turn around / And once again the truth is found\".\n\nDonovan's songwriting for \"The Hurdy Gurdy Man\" centered on drones on such songs as \"Peregrine\", \"The River Song\" and \"Tangier\" (the latter two being compositions by his friend \"Gypsy Dave\" (Gyp Mills), and pop music on most of the other tracks. \"As I Recall It\" continued Donovan's infatuation with jazz. \"Jennifer Juniper\" and \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" were both released as singles well before the album was released.\n\nThe recording sessions for the album are purported to have included future Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones.

{"id": "1826365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826365", "title": "Christkind", "text": "Christkind\n\nThe Christkind (; ), sometimes also called \"Christkindl\", is the traditional Christmas gift-bringer in Austria, Switzerland, southern and western Germany, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Belgium, Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary, parts of northeastern France, Upper Silesia in Poland, parts of Hispanic America, in certain areas of southern Brazil, and in the Acadiana region of Louisiana. In some parts of Italy, the analogous figure of the Christkind is known as , however Santa Claus is the traditional bearer of Christmas gifts. Christkind is called in Portuguese (\"Jesus Boy\"), in Hungarian (\"Little Jesus\"), in Slovak (\"Little Jesus\"), in Czech (\"Little Jesus\"), in Latin America (\"God Child\") or (\"Jesus Child\") and in Croatian or (\"Little Jesus\").\n\nPromulgated by Martin Luther at the Protestant Reformation in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants adopted this gift bringer, the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve. As such, the \"Lutheran Church promoted Christ as the children's gift-giver, hoping to draw attention to the child for whom Christmas was named.\" The Christkind was adopted in Catholic areas of Germany during the 19th century. To this date, the Christkindl \"remains the main gift bringer in many Catholic countries in Latin America.\"\n\nThe Christkind is a sprite-like child, usually depicted with blond hair and angelic wings. Martin Luther intended it to be a reference to the incarnation of Jesus as an infant (see Christ Child). Sometimes the Christ Child is, instead of the infant Jesus, interpreted as a specific angel bringing the presents, as it appears in some processions together with an image of little Jesus Christ. Later, the Christkind was said to make rounds delivering gifts with St. Nicholas.\n\nChildren never see the Christkind in person, and parents tell them that Christkind will not come and bring presents if they are curious and try to spot it. The family enters the living room, where the Christmas tree has been put up, for the opening of presents (the \"Bescherung\"), when the parents say that they think that the Christkind who has brought the presents has now left again. In some traditions, the departure is announced by the ringing of a small bell, which the parents pretend to have heard or which is secretly done by one of the adults in the family.\n\nSince the 1990s, the Christkind has faced increasing competition from the Weihnachtsmann, caused by the use of the American version of Santa Claus as an advertising figure. Many traditionalist Catholics in recent times have advocated for the tradition of the Christkind as a \"beautiful means of restoring the true meaning of Christmas\".\n\nChristkindl or Christkindel are diminutive versions of Christkind. Christkind and Belsnickel are also found among communities of Volga German descent in Argentina. A well-known figure is the Christkind at the Christkindlesmarkt in Nuremberg, which is represented by a young woman chosen every two years for this task.\n\nChristkindl is also a part of the city of Steyr in Austria, named after the allegedly miraculous wax statue of Christkind in the town church.\n\nJežíšek (the Baby Jesus) is the Czech-language name for the Christkind Christmas figure. There is no accurate description of Ježíšek. He has been depicted as a baby, toddler, and young lad. Some even consider him simply as an abstract figure. According to tradition, Ježíšek makes his appearance on Christmas Eve. In some families, Ježíšek is said to bring the Christmas tree and the gifts, while the elders do it in secret. In other families, the Christmas tree is decorated collaboratively with the children. Christmas gifts are delivered and unboxed on Christmas Eve (24 December).\n\nThe tradition of Ježíšek has been observed by the Czechs for more than 400 years. This is partly due to the large population of Catholics during that period. It was Martin Luther who coined the term during the 16th century, an attempt to provide a suitable name to their figure other than St. Nicholas.\n\nAt present, belief in Ježíšek is upheld in modern Czech society, despite having the lowest rates of religious affiliation in the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1826375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826375", "title": "J. Frank Norris", "text": "J. Frank Norris\n\nJ. Frank Norris was born in Dadeville in Tallapoosa County in eastern Alabama, but the family shortly moved to Arkansas and then back to Columbiana in Shelby County in central Alabama. In the late 1880s, the Norrises purchased land near Hubbard in Hill County, Texas, about thirty miles north of Waco, where they farmed. James Warner Norris was an alcoholic, and Frank Norris claimed that his father once beat him severely after he had emptied his liquor bottles. In 1891, both were shot by an acquaintance of Warner Norris, and Frank said he did not fully recuperate for three years.\n\nNorris was converted at a Baptist revival meeting in the early 1890s, and in 1897, he became pastor of Mount Antioch Baptist Church in Mount Calm in Hill County, Texas. The following year he enrolled in Baptist-affiliated Baylor University in Waco, which he attended from 1898 to 1903. He then earned a Master of Theology degree from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1905, Norris returned to Texas as the pastor of the McKinney Avenue Baptist Church in Dallas. He resigned that post in 1907 to become editor of the \"Baptist Standard\". Norris is credited with ending the Texas Baptist newspaper war, with moving Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary from Waco to Fort Worth, and with persuading the state legislature to abolish racetrack gambling.\n\nIn 1909, Norris sold his interest in the \"Baptist Standard\" and accepted the pastorate of the First Baptist Church in Fort Worth, where he served for forty-four years until his death. In 1912, Norris was acquitted of arson and perjury charges related to fires that respectively destroyed his church auditorium and severely damaged his home. A second fire razed the structure in 1929, and rebuilding began at the advent of the Great Depression. Norris was also the radio pastor of, variously, KFQB, KTAT and then KSAT (not to be confused with KTSA and KSAT-TV, both in San Antonio), where he started the first regular radio ministry in the United States in the 1920s.\n\nThe height of Norris' career came in the 1920s, when he became the leader of the fundamentalist movement in Texas by attacking the teaching of \"that hell-born, Bible-destroying, deity-of-Christ-denying, German rationalism known as evolution\" at Baylor University. Because of his attacks on Baylor and denominational leaders, Norris and his church were denied seats at the annual meetings of the Baptist General Convention of Texas in 1922 and 1923.\n\nIn his 1926 sermon series \"Rum and Romanism,\" Norris attacked Mayor H. C. Meacham of Fort Worth, whom he accused of misappropriating funds for Roman Catholic causes. That same year, Norris killed lumberman Dexter Elliott Chipps, a friend of Meacham, in Norris's church office. Norris claimed Chipps had threatened his life, and when Norris was tried for murder, he was acquitted on grounds of self-defense.\n\nDuring 1928, Norris campaigned against the election of the Democrat Al Smith to the presidency and voiced anti-Catholic views from the pulpit, his radio station, and his weekly newspaper. Herbert C. Hoover, the Republican nominee, won the election and carried Texas as well, the first member of that party ever to prevail in a Texas general election.\n\nIn 1935, Norris accepted the pastorate of a second church, Temple Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. By 1946, the combined membership of the two congregations was more than 26,000. For sixteen years, Norris commuted by train and plane between the two churches.\n\nThough Norris would presumably have mostly agreed on matters of faith and interpretation with Ben M. Bogard, who in 1924 founded the American Baptist Association, the two were often at odds. Bogard claimed that Norris was vain and prone to exaggerate Norris' ministerial success. Though he accused Norris of failing to preach the fundamentals of the faith, the two in time developed a begrudging friendship. Bogard said, \"When I get to heaven I expect to find Frank Norris there in spite of that wicked streak that runs through him.\"\n\nIn 1941, Norris faced a $25,000 libel judgment payable to another Baptist minister, R. E. White, because of remarks about White in Norris' Detroit denominational paper, \"The Fundamentalist\". Norris exhausted all appeals to the Texas Supreme Court. The publicity about the suit weakened Norris' hold over his fellow fundamentalists.\n\nIn September 1947, while on a tour of Europe, Norris secured an audience with Pope Pius XII and declared that the pope was \"the last Gibraltar in Europe against Communism.\" Thereafter, Norris took the position that communism was more dangerous than Catholicism, and some of Norris's erstwhile allies, such as Toronto evangelist T. T. Shields, criticized him for \"folly.\"\n\nIn the late 1930s, Norris organized a group of independent, premillennial Baptist churches into the Premillennial Missionary Baptist Fellowship (later the World Baptist Fellowship), in an attempt to combat what he believed were socialist, liberal, and \"modernist\" tendencies within the Southern Baptist Convention. Norris's group established the Fundamentalist Baptist Bible Institute, later Arlington Baptist College.\n\nAfter World War II, when John Birch, a graduate of his seminary in Fort Worth, was killed by the Chinese communists, Norris renewed his attack on communist influences in the United States. Norris's premillennial views led him to urge President Harry Truman to recognize and support the new state of Israel.\n\nNorris published a religious newspaper, \"The Searchlight\", the front page of which had a picture of Norris grasping a Bible in one hand and a searchlight in the other while Satan cowered in the opposite lower corner. Norris died of a heart attack while attending a youth camp at Jacksonville, Florida in 1952. He was succeeded at the First Baptist Church of Fort Worth by Homer Ritchie, who pastored the church for thirty years.\n\n\n"}

ITE offers apprenticeships for the skilled trades and diplomas in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and law. Established by Ministry of Education, it was formerly known as Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB). ITE has three colleges that offer the National ITE Certificate (NITEC), Higher NITEC, and Technical Diploma and Work-Study Diploma.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, vocational training was managed by two separate statutory boards, the Adult Education Board (AEB) and the Industrial Training Board (ITB). They merged in 1979 to become the VITB. The VITB was formed to promote and develop vocational training.\n\nThe ITE was established as a post-secondary institution to improve the employability of vocational trainees and to restructure the VITB's programmes. The government decided that every student in Singapore had to have at least 10 years of general education, with technically inclined students filtered to the Normal (Technical) stream in secondary schools as preparation. These students would then attend the ITE after they finished secondary school education.\n\nAnnually, ITE takes in 25% of an annual school cohort, or an intake of about 13,000 students per year, with an annual enrollment of about 25,000. Full-time students are typically secondary school graduates with the requisite GCE 'N' or 'O' level qualifications.\nTo refine technical education in Singapore, the \"One ITE System, Three Colleges\" Model of Education and Governance was introduced in 2005 to merge the 10 ITE's into 3 regional colleges. ITE College West (Dover Campus), ITE Headquarters (Balestier Campus), ITE College West (Bukit Batok Campus) and ITE College West (Clementi Campus) were merged into ITE College West while ITE College Central (Bishan Campus), ITE College Central (Balestier Campus), ITE College Central (MacPherson Campus), ITE College Central (Yishun Campus) and ITE College Central (Tampines Campus) were merged into ITE College Central. \n\n\nITE has won a number of local awards as well as international awards.

In early June 1940, after reaching the English Channel following the breakthrough in the Ardennes, the \"Panzergruppe Guderian\" was formed from the XIX Army Corps, and thrust deep into France, cutting off the Maginot Line. In November 1940, it was upgraded into \"Panzergruppe 2\".\n\nThe 2nd Panzer Group () was formed in November 1940 from Panzer Group Guderian. In October 1941 it was renamed the 2nd Panzer Army. Panzer Group 2 played a significant role in the early stages of the German invasion of the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa in 1941 when it was a constituent part of Army Group Centre.\n\n2nd Panzer Group was part of the Army Group Centre during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army formed the Army Group's southern pincer while Hoth's 3rd Panzer Army formed the northern pincer destroying several Soviet armies during the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa. During the battles of Bialystok and Minsk substantial numbers of prisoners were captured and several weapons captured.\n\nSuffering heavy losses in men and equipment, the German forces advanced deeper into the Soviet Union. The \"rasputitsa\" season (literally \"roadlessness\", due to heavy rains and sluggish muddy roads) began to slow down the formation's progress to a few kilometres a day. The rasputitsa was not an unusual phenomenon, but the Wehrmacht did not prepare for this contingency as the German high command had expected the German army to be in Moscow and beyond at this time, with the campaign over before the end of summer. After Minsk, the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Armies captured Smolensk in another successful pincer operation taking around 300,000 prisoners.\n\nHitler ordered Army Group Center to detach the 2nd Panzer Group, which was to turn southward towards Kiev to form the northern pincer at Kiev. Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army and Kleist's 1st Panzer Army locked in a pincer around Kiev to trap 665,000 Soviet prisoners. After concluding the Kiev encirclement, the German planned for the three Panzer armies to attack Moscow from different directions. 4th Panzer Army in the North around Leningrad would attack southward. Hoth's 3rd Panzer Army would attack eastward towards Moscow, while 2nd Panzer Army would turn northwest and attack Moscow from the south.\n\nThe Group's divisions had suffered heavy attrition since the beginning of invasion, and experienced shortages in fuel and ammunition due to the breakdown in logistics. By November, the situation of Guderian's Panzer Group was dire. Nonetheless, expecting the Red Army's resistance to finally collapse and driven by National Socialist military thinking, including the idea that the \"will\" was key to success, Guderian continued to direct his forces to attack. By early December, the final advance on Moscow failed in the face of stiffening Soviet resistance and due to shortages in men and materiel.\n\nIn August 1943, the 2nd Panzer Army was transferred to occupied Yugoslavia, where it was incorporated into Army Group F and engaged in anti-partisan operations against the Chetniks under Draža Mihailović and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito. Despite engaging in several operations aimed to crush the partisan movement, particularly the communists, no clear victory was gained. Indeed, the partisan movement grew in size and equipment, particularly after the fall of Italian Fascism in the 1943 coup of 25 Luglio led to the mass defection and surrender of Italian units stationed in occupied Bosnia and Montenegro.\n\nThroughout 1943-44, the 2nd Panzer Army was progressively stripped of its heavy armor destined for the war on the Eastern Front, and became a primarily motorized infantry force. It did gain specialized Alpine support from units like the Brandenburgers and 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen divisions. However, endemic guerilla warfare cost the 2nd Panzer Army heavily, and only months after the Raid on Drvar (Operation Rösselsprung) failed to assassinate the communist partisan leadership via airborne assault, the 2nd Panzer Army and all of Army Group F were pushed out of Belgrade in a joint operation by the Partisans and Red Army during the Belgrade Offensive. The 2nd Panzer Army finished the war in disarray in modern Austria.\n\nAs all German armies on the Eastern Front, Panzer Group 2 implemented the criminal Commissar Order during Operation Barbarossa. In September 1942, the 2nd Panzer Army took part in war crimes while conducting anti-guerrilla operations in the Soviet Union. These operations killed at least a thousand people, razed entire villages, and deported over 18,500. During these operations, Jews and suspected partisans were murdered by being forced to drag ploughs through minefields.\n\nIn August 1943, the army's headquarters was subordinated to Army Group F and transferred to the Balkans for anti-partisan operations. The army became primarily an infantry formation at this point and found itself committed to anti-partisan operations, and personnel were accused postwar of multiple atrocities against civilians and partisans.\n\nAfter the Belgrade Offensive overtook army headquarters, surviving units of the 2nd Panzer Army were subsequently transferred to Hungary as part of Army Group South in January 1945, holding off Soviet invasion of Austria. 2nd Panzer Army took part in the Battle of the Transdanubian Hills in March 1945 before surrendering at the end of the war to both Soviet and Anglo-American forces.\n\nOrganization of Panzer Group Guderian on 28 May 1940\n"}

{"id": "1826396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826396", "title": "Federal Police (Germany)", "text": "Federal Police (Germany)\n\nThe Federal Police (Bundespolizei or BPOL) is a (primarily) uniformed federal police force in Germany. It is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (\"Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI)\"). Ordinary police forces, meanwhile, are under the administration of the individual German states (\"Bundesländer\") and are known as the \"Landespolizei\".\n\nThe \"Bundespolizei\" was formed from the \"Bundesgrenzschutz\" (BGS) (\"Federal Border Guard\"), which had a more restricted role, the West German Railway Police (\"Bahnpolizei\"), formerly an independent force; and the East German \"Transportpolizei\" in 1990. \n\nPrior to 1994 BGS members also had military combatant status due to their historical foundation and border-guard role in West Germany. In July 2005 the law renaming the BGS as the BPOL was enacted.\n\nThe BPOL has the following missions:\n\n\nThe \"Bundespolizei\" can also be used to reinforce state police if requested by a state \"(Land)\" government. The BPOL maintains these reserve forces to deal with major demonstrations, disturbances or emergencies, supplementing the capabilities of the State Operational Support Units. Several highly trained detachments are available for crisis situations requiring armored cars, water cannon or other special equipment.\n\nBPOL investigators conduct criminal investigations only within its jurisdiction; otherwise the cases are referred to the appropriate state police force or to the federal criminal investigative agency, the Federal Criminal Police (\"Bundeskriminalamt\", BKA).\n\nIn addition, the \"Bundespolizei\" cooperates closely with German state executive authorities, such as prosecutor's offices (\"Staatsanwaltschaft\") in pursuing criminal investigations.\n\nOn the night of 13 September 2015 Germany unilaterally reintroduced border controls, under emergency provisions of the Schengen Agreement, due to the 2015 European migrant crisis overwhelming Germany's available resources, law enforcement and otherwise. The nominally temporary border controls were initially put in place just on the border with Austria, but by the following day (Monday 14 September 2015) they were being put in place at all borders with fellow EU members. The same day, Austria and other EU members who were part of the Schengen Area began to put in place their own border controls (again meant to be temporary) in response to Germany's actions.\n\nThe new German border controls are to be primarily enforced both by the various \"Landespolizei\" of those German states that adjoin external borders, and in particular by the \"Bundespolizei\".\n\nThe \"Bundespolizei\" consists of 48,686 personnel:\n\nThe BPOL national headquarters (BPOL-\"Präsidium\") in Potsdam performs all central control functions. Eight regional headquarters (BPOL-\"Direktion\") control the BPOL stations conduct rail police and border protection missions. These areas of responsibility conform to the federal state boundaries which they did not do prior to 1 March 2008.\n\nThe regional headquarters are as follows:\n\nThese regional headquarters each have an investigation department and a mobile inspection and observation unit. Moreover, they control the 67 BPOL stations (BPOL-\"Inspektion\") which in turn control the \"Bundespolizeireviere\" or precincts located in places that require a 24-hour presence by BPOL officers.\n\nA special \"Direktion\" is responsible for Frankfurt International Airport.\n\nThe central school for advanced and vocational training is in Lübeck and controls the six basic training schools in Swisttal, Neustrelitz, Oerlenbach, Walsrode, Eschwege and Bamberg. It is also in charge of the Federal Police Sport School in Bad Endorf and a competitive sport project in Kienbaum near Berlin. The sport school specialises in winter sport events and has trained many of Germany's top skiers and skaters such as Claudia Pechstein.\n\nThe \"Zentrale Direktion Bundesbereitschaftspolizei\" controls the mobile support and rapid reaction battalions located in Bayreuth, Deggendorf, Blumberg (near Berlin), Hünfeld, Uelzen, Duderstadt, Sankt Augustin, Bad Bergzabern, Bad Düben and Ratzeburg. The number of \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" companies increased in March 2008 from 28 to 29 comprising approx. 25 percent of Germany’s police support units.\n\nThe following special units also exist:\n\nIn 1951 the West German government established a Federal Border Protection Force (\"Bundesgrenzschutz\" or BGS) composed of 10,000 men under the Federal Interior Ministry’s jurisdiction. The force replaced allied military organisations such as the U.S. Constabulary then patrolling West Germany’s borders. The BGS was described as a mobile, lightly armed police force for border and internal security despite fears that it would be the nucleus of a new German army. When West Germany did establish an army, the Bundeswehr, BGS personnel were given the choice of staying in the BGS or joining the army. Most decided to join the army.\n\nIn 1953, the BGS took control of the German Passport Control Service. In 1972 the Compulsory Border Guard Service was enacted by the parliament, which - in theory - is still in force, but suspended, similar to the conscription for the Bundeswehr. In 1976, the state police grades replaced the military rank structure and BGS training was modified to closely match that of the state police forces (\"Landespolizei\"). The West German Railway Police (\"Bahnpolizei\"), formerly an independent force, and the East German \"Transportpolizei\" were restructured under the BGS in 1990.\n\nIn July 2005, the BGS was renamed the \"Bundespolizei\" or BPOL (Federal Police) to reflect its transition to a multi-faceted federal police agency. The change also involved a shift to blue uniforms and livery for vehicles and helicopters. The German Interior Ministry reviewed the structure of the BPOL in 2007 and in March 2008 made the structure leaner to get more officers out of offices and onto patrol.\n\n\"Bundespolizei\" vehicles have number plates that are based on the BP XX-YYY system. BP stands for \"Bundespolizei.\" Older vehicles may still have the BGS \"BG\" plates.\n\nXX is a number from 10 to 55 indicating the type of vehicle:\n\n\nYYY is a combination of up to three numbers.\n\nThe \"Bundespolizei\" have favoured, and in some cases still favor (where the model is still in production), the following types of car:\n\n\nThis is some of the weaponry utilized by the Federal Police: \n\nThe Federal Police now has been reduced to three flight amenities pattern of 94 helicopters. This is the largest civilian helicopter fleet in Germany.\n\nApproximately 500 working dogs are used in the Federal Police at present. Most of the dogs are German shepherds. Other dog breeds are also used such as malinois, Dutch shepherd, German wirehaired pointer, giant schnauzer, and rottweiler. They accompany their handlers on daily missions in railway facilities, at airports, at the border or in physical security. Most working dogs live with the families of their handlers. Basic and advanced training is performed under the supervision of the Federal Police Academy at the Federal Police canine schools in Bleckede (Lower Saxony) and Neuendettelsau (Bavaria) where dogs and handlers go through patrol dog and explosive detection courses.\n\nJunior ranks (\"Mittlerer Dienst\")\nSenior ranks (\"Gehobener Dienst\")\nCommand ranks (\"Höherer Dienst\")\n\n"}

{"id": "1826418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826418", "title": "Feed line", "text": "Feed line\n\nIn a radio antenna, the feed line (feedline), or feeder, is the cable or other transmission line that connects the antenna with the radio transmitter or receiver. In a transmitting antenna, it feeds the radio frequency (RF) current from the transmitter to the antenna, where it is radiated as radio waves. In a receiving antenna it transfers the tiny RF voltage induced in the antenna by the radio wave to the receiver. In order to carry RF current efficiently, feed lines are made of specialized types of cable called transmission line. The most widely used types of feed line are coaxial cable, twin-lead, ladder line, and at microwave frequencies, waveguide.\n\nParticularly with a transmitting antenna, the feed line is a critical component that must be adjusted to work correctly with the antenna and transmitter. Each type of transmission line has a specific characteristic impedance. This must be matched to the impedance of the antenna and the transmitter, to transfer power efficiently to the antenna. If these impedances are not matched it can cause a condition called standing waves on the feed line, in which the RF energy is reflected back toward the transmitter, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter. This adjustment is done with a device called an antenna tuner in the transmitter, and sometimes a matching network at the antenna. The degree of mismatch between the feedline and the antenna is measured by an instrument called an SWR meter (standing wave ratio meter), which measures the \"standing wave ratio\" (SWR) on the line.\n\nTwin lead is used to connect FM radios and television receivers with their antennas, although it has been largely replaced in the latter application by coaxial cable, and as a feedline for low power transmitters such as amateur radio transmitters. It consists of two wire conductors running parallel to each other with a precisely constant spacing, molded in polyethylene insulating material in a flat ribbon-like cable. The distance between the two wires is small relative to the wavelength of the RF signal carried on the wire. Furthermore, the RF current in one wire is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted). Thus, if both wires radiate energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies. Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires at the same time and equally in magnitude and direction. At the end of the transmission line the inverted signal wire is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted signal wire by the receiving circuitry. Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out. \n\nTwin lead is considered a Balanced line.\n\nCoaxial cable is probably the most widely used type of feedline, used for frequencies below the microwave (SHF) range. It consists of a wire center conductor and a braided or solid metallic \"shield\" conductor, usually copper or aluminum surrounding it. The center conductor is separated from the outer shield by a dielectric, usually plastic foam, to keep the separation between the two conductors precisely constant. The shield is covered with an outer plastic insulation jacket. In \"hard coax\" cable, used for high power transmitting applications like television transmitters, the shield is a rigid or flexible metal pipe containing a compressed gas such as nitrogen, and the internal conductor is held centered with periodic plastic spacers. It is a type of unbalanced line, the shield conductor is usually connected to electrical ground. Coaxial cable's advantage is that the enclosing shield conductor isolates the cable from external electromagnetic fields, so it is very immune to interference.\n\nWaveguide is used at microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which other types of feedline have excessive power losses. A waveguide is a hollow metallic conductor or pipe. It can have a circular or square cross-section. Waveguide runs are often pressurized with nitrogen gas to keep moisture out. The RF signal travels through the pipe similarly to the way sound travels in a tube. The metal walls keep it from radiating energy outwards and also prevent interference from entering the waveguide. Because of the cost and maintenance waveguide entails, microwave antennas often have the output stage of the transmitter or the RF front end of the receiver located at the antenna, and the signal is fed to or from the rest of the transmitter or receiver at a lower frequency, using coaxial cable. \n\nA waveguide is considered an unbalanced transmission line.\n\nThis is a comparison of a few common feed line characteristics. Larger lists are available in other articles, references, and directly from manufacturers.\n"}

It is a stand-alone sequel to the 1994 film \"Richie Rich\", starring David Gallagher as the title character. Its plot is similar to \"It's a Wonderful Life\", placing Richie Rich in the role of George Bailey and Reggie Van Dough in the role of Mr. Potter.\n\nIt's Christmas Eve and Richie Rich, the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \"big pie\" from it, and is given a \"pig sty\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes.\n\nDuring tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called Root Canal. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process. Richie and Cadbury end up in an accident in which the sleigh falls and literally explodes along with the presents, while Cadbury hurts his ankle badly. Richie runs off to fetch help, but once he enters the city, he sees that the situation has changed dramatically. Reggie is cooking up rumors about him, and all the people have turned against him.\n\nDevastated and believing the whole incident was his fault, Richie goes into Keanbean's laboratory and squats in front of the wishing machine. While fretting over his ill luck, he accidentally wishes that he was never born. The machine at once grants his wish, following which he is transported to another world in which he was never born and hence nobody recognizes him. Reggie has taken over as Richard and Regina's son, and is now the richest kid in the world. He bosses around everyone. Roads and buildings are named after him. Reggie controls the entire town and including the police force. This world is very sad, and hunger and misery are seen all over. This makes Richie realize that things would not be better if he was not born, and hence decides to go back to the world in which he is Richie Rich.\n\nThough his parents do not recognize him anymore, he is happy that his dog, Dollar, does. He takes Dollar with him, only to enrage Reggie, who is his current owner. Reggie orders policemen to search for Richie, who is falsely called the \"dognapper\", and also announces a reward for catching him. After outsmarting various policemen who try but fail to catch him, Richie finds Cadbury, who is still part of Root Canal, and Keanbean, who runs his own laboratory called \"Keanbean's World of Wonders\". Richie questions Keanbean about the wishing machine, which he says, requires a \"Pegliasaurus\" wishing bone in order to be complete. Along with his friends who decide to help him, Richie goes to the city museum to retrieve the bone from the dinosaur skeleton. After passing through laser detection systems successfully, they get it, using the fishing rod invented by Keanbean. Before they get out of the museum, Richie and his friends spot Reggie's parents, who are now working as night guards there.\n\nOnce they reach the lab, they get the machine to work properly. However, before Richie could wish himself back, Reggie arrives there with the policemen. Richie, Cadbury, Keanbean, and Richie's friends are put in jail, while Reggie takes the machine home. At home, Reggie wishes for the ability to fly, but before he can make another wish, Dollar runs off with the wishbone. When it does not work the second time, he leaves the room in a huff, and retires. In jail, Richie and his friends are bailed out by Root Canal. They all rush to Reggie's house, and while he is still sleeping, Richie tries to wish himself back. However, they find that the machine is no longer working, as Reggie had kicked it in anger earlier. While Keanbean is fixing it, Reggie wakes up and comes flying in, only to be attacked by Richie and his friends. They defeat him and everyone quits working for him, with Sgt. Mooney refusing to work for someone who would cancel Christmas. After that, the machine starts working again, and Richie wishes himself back as Richie Rich.\n\nRichie sets right all the things that had gone wrong since his vanishing act, and is now much more grateful to be alive. As everyone is glad to have him back, they gather around the Christmas tree and sing.\n\nReggie is caught red-handed by his parents with his actions against Richie, and Reggie's parents make him apologize for all the trouble he caused to Richie, admitting that he was the one who took control of the sleigh and ruined the event. Richie realizes that it wasn't his fault and he made that wish for nothing. They forgive each other.\n\n\nThe Langham Huntington Hotel and Spa, in Pasadena, California, was used for exterior scenes of the sprawling Rich Family Mansion. The interior lobby and vault of the disused Valuta Bank building, in downtown Los Angeles, was used for the scene in which Richie traps the pursuing Rich security men. The background music in selected scenes was also used in Digimon, \"\" and \"Casper Meets Wendy\". Colonial Street at Universal City, previously used in \"The Munsters\", \"Leave it to Beaver\", and \"The 'Burbs\", is also featured.\n"}

Harriet Harman, the former Acting Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition, has represented the constituency since 1983. The Camberwell and Peckham constituency is very ethnically diverse, and has the highest proportion of black/African/Afro-Caribbean residents – 37.4%, of all the constituencies in England and Wales, according to ONS 2011 Census figures. This includes 22.4% being African (highest), 9.3% being Caribbean and 5.7% being of any other black background (highest). 40.8% of residents were born outside of the UK.\n\nWith 50.6% of all residential properties being social housing, it also has the highest proportion of social housing of any parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom. More than three in 10 residents are single parents.\n\nThe area is also socially diverse with fine Georgian houses in parts of Camberwell, while Nunhead to the east has experienced considerable regeneration in recent years.

It is a four-story building built over the corner of the underground Moscone Center convention center. Metreon opened on June 16, 1999, as the first of a proposed chain of Sony \"urban entertainment centers\", aggregating dining, games, music, exhibitions, shopping, and movies. Sony intended the ambitious 85 million dollar project to be not only a theme park and gallery for Sony products but also a way to reinforce a sophisticated image for the Sony brand.\n\nIn 2006 Metreon was sold to Westfield Group, a mall developer, and it was refashioned as a food-oriented mall. In 2011, with few exceptions, remaining businesses in the mall were closed. Westfield began a major renovation with an emphasis on dining, including Target creating a large downtown department store that now takes up the second floor. In April 2012, Westfield sold the Metreon to Starwood Capital Group. Westfield (and its successor, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield) continues to be responsible for management.\n\nThe Metreon's original attractions included a movie theater including both standard and IMAX screens, a multimedia edutainment presentation involving audio-animatronics and 3-D film based on the famous book \"The Way Things Work\" by David Macaulay, a play area for young children based on Maurice Sendak's popular children's book \"Where the Wild Things Are\" (sharing a floor with an \"In the Night Kitchen\" themed restaurant), and an arcade and bar, the Airtight Garage, based on French comic artist and graphic designer Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud's graphic novel of the same name and featuring all original games.\n\nIn October 2001 Metreon, in partnership with Sony's anime television network, Animax, was host to an anime festival, in which numerous anime titles were broadcast across its \"Action Theatre\". As a hub for Sony products, the Metreon often hosted special events for the public when new products were released. Consumers flocked to the Metreon for high-demand items such as the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3.\n\nAlthough Sony opened two additional centers in Tokyo and Berlin in 1999, the original center failed to turn the expected profit. Despite promising first-year foot traffic of six million, one million ahead of pre-launch projections, by the summer of 2001 \"The Way Things Work\" was closed. The other major exhibit, \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" closed sometime after July 2004.\n\nThe Airtight Garage's games proved unpopular, with the exception of HyperBowl, a 3D obstacle course bowling game featuring air-supported bowling balls used as trackballs, and they eventually were gradually replaced by other, better-known games, until the arcade was finally closed, then reopened as \"Portal One,\" which preserved the decor, full bar, and Hyperbowl but was otherwise a more typical arcade. Sunday May 13, 2007 was Portal One arcade's last day of operation. The arcade was relaunched again as a Tilt.\n\nThe 16-screen Loews (now AMC) theater was a success, becoming one of the most profitable theaters in the country and claiming much of the Metreon foot traffic; the lease agreement did not apportion ticket or concession sales to Metreon, however.\n\nBy 2002, there were persistent rumors that Sony wished to pull out of management of the property. In February 2006, Metreon was sold to The Westfield Group, the owner of the nearby Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping mall, and Forest City Enterprises, a real estate development company.\n\nIn early 2009, Sony announced that it would be closing the Sony and PlayStation stores, the last flagship stores located in the mall. Following the announcement, on March 3, 2009, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency approved plans from owners Westfield Group and Forest City Enterprises to renovate Metreon into a \"restaurant-centric\" mall. Expected modifications include relocation of the Fourth and Mission street entrance to the center of the block and the installation of a food terrace facing Yerba Buena Gardens. The San Francisco Filipino Cultural Center and the \"Tavern on the Green\" restaurant were projected tenants. Tavern on the Green, however, entered bankruptcy on September 11, 2009, \"throwing into doubt\" the plans for the Metreon location.\n\nA seven-day-a-week farmers' market operated as an interim tenant in the former Discovery Channel Store space between May and November 2009. It closed in November 2009.\n\nThe Metreon building has been redeveloped as a Target store, opened in October 2012. Target is leasing 99,677 square feet. Other tenants are the AMC theater, now with its own entrance, a food court, Chronicle Books, Massage Envy, National University, The City View event space, and various other food purveyors not directly in the court. The Sanraku sushi restaurant and Buckhorn sandwich shop remain in the new food court, along with Jillians, which is now only accessible from outside. The movie theater has also experienced upgrades, with the IMAX auditorium now featuring their new laser projector, and the addition of Dolby Cinema and recliner seats.\n\nThe Metreon 16, an IMAX 3D movie theater and Dolby Cinema theater operated by AMC Theatres, and Jillians, a restaurant, were the only attractions that remained open when Target opened in 2012.\n\nThe Metreon was also home to the Walk of Game, which is loosely based on the Walk of Fame — honorees include Shigeru Miyamoto, Nolan Bushnell, \"StarCraft\", Sid Meier, John D. Carmack, Super Mario, Sonic The Hedgehog, and Link from \"The Legend of Zelda\" series. A special Walk of Game event took place there in 2005 and 2006. It was unknown that it would ever continue and is now most likely obsolete, now that Target is taking up the second floor where the Walk of Game was.\n\n"}

The mountain range in the Berner Oberland south of the Aare and north of the Rhône are collectively called the Bernese Alps.\n\nThe flag of the Berner Oberland consists of a black eagle in a gold field (in reference to the region's old status as reichsfrei) over two fields in the cantonal colours of red and black.\n\nThe Swiss German dialects spoken in the Berner Oberland are Highest Alemannic German, contrasting with the High Alemannic Bernese German spoken in Bern and the northern parts of the canton.\n\nIn the short-lived Helvetic Republic (1798-1803), the Berner Oberland was a separate canton.\n\nPrehistorically the Berner Oberland was crossed by hunters or traders, but the first known settlements were from the Roman era. The Romans settled along the river and the lakes. They used a number of alpine passes including; the Brünig, Susten (with a Roman mansio), Grimsel, Lötschen, Gemmi, Rawil, Sanetsch and the Col du Pillon.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, a number of Berner Oberland villages grew around valley parish churches which were religious and cultural centers within each surrounding valley. During Middle Ages, the Berner Oberland first belonged to the Kingdom of Burgundy followed by the Dukes of Zähringen. After the extinction of the Zähringen line, the Berner Oberland was ruled by a number of local Barons (including Oberhofen, Strättligen, Brienz-Ringgenberg, Wädenswil, Weissenburg). For a time, some of the Walser barons (Raron, vom Turn) ruled portions of the Berner Oberland. The Saanen valley was ruled by the Counts of Gruyères. Portions of the alpine passes were held, until the 19th century, by the Bishop of Sion.\n\nThe expansionist policy of the city of Bern led them into the Berner Oberland. Through conquest, purchase, mortgage or marriage politics Bern was able to acquire the majority of the Berner Oberland from the indebted local barons between 1323 and 1400. Under Bernese control, the five valleys enjoyed extensive rights and far-reaching autonomy in the Bäuerten (farming cooperative municipalities) and \"Talverbänden\" (rural alpine communities). Throughout the Late Middle Ages, the Berner Oberland, as a whole or in part, revolted several times against Bernese authority. The Evil League (\"Böser Bund\") in 1445 fought against Bernese military service and taxes following the Old Zürich War, in 1528 the Berner Oberland rose up in resistance to the Protestant Reformation and in 1641 Thun revolted.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the settlement pattern in the Berner Oberland was somewhat consistent. A main settlement grew on the valley floor below an elevation near . This main settlement had a market and often a castle or other fortifications. This market town was surrounded by scattered villages, hamlets and individual farm houses to an elevation of . During the 14th-16th centuries, the Berner Oberland villages began extensive trading with the Bernese grain producing towns in the lowlands. This allowed the alpine villages to renounce self-sufficiency in grain and focus on raising cattle in the high alpine pastures and bringing them down into the valleys in the winter (transhumance). They then exported cattle over the passes into Italy and into the Bernese lowlands. Around 1500, in addition to the seven medieval markets, eleven new cattle markets opened to allow the Berner Oberland villagers to sell their cattle.\n\nAfter the in 1798, the old Bernese order was fractured and the Berner Oberland was separated from the canton of Bern, forming the canton of Oberland. Within this new canton, historic borders and traditional rights were not considered. As there had been no previous separatist feeling amongst the conservative population, there was little enthusiasm for the new order.\n\nThe 1801 Malmaison Constitution proposed reuniting the canton of Oberland with Bern, but it was not until the Act of Mediation, two years later, with the abolition of the Helvetic Republic and the partial restoration of the \"ancien régime\", that the two cantons were reunited.\n\nIn 1729, Albrecht von Haller published the poem \"Die Alpen\" about his travels through the alpine regions. This combined with other reports and alpine paintings started the tourism industry in the Berner Oberland. By 1800 there were resorts on Lake Thun and Lake Brienz (especially at Interlaken between the two lakes). Shortly thereafter the resorts expanded into the alpine valleys (Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald), and began attracting English guests. However, because of the widespread poverty of the 19th century many residents of the Simmen valley and the Interlaken district emigrated to North America, Germany or Russia.\n\nIn the late 19th century, new transportation links made it easier for people to travel into the valleys. The Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway opened in 1913 and became the largest privately owned railroad in Switzerland. The collapse of the hotel industry during both world wars forced a diversification of the economy. After 1950 a new wave of hotel construction of hotels and holiday homes and apartments, led to a strong population growth. Starting in the 1930s and increasingly after 1950 funiculars, cable cars and chair lifts opened up many of the high alpine villages for winter sports and tourism.\n\nThe Berner Oberland designates primarily an area around the upper valley of the Aare with its many larger and smaller side-valleys.\n\nIts largest part and the Alpine part of the Aare before the river enters Lake Brienz is called the Haslital culminating on the Grimsel Pass at its southeastern corner connecting with the Goms in the Upper Valais, and Andermatt in canton of Uri (UR) via the Furka Pass. And its major side-valley, called the Gadmertal, on its most eastern point culminates at the Susten Pass just south of the Titlis (OW) connecting with the valley of the Alpine Reuss (UR), the northern part of the St. Gotthard Route. The Joch Pass to the northeast at the beginning of the Gental, a foot pass west of the Titlis connecting to the canton of Nidwalden (NW) and further down to the resort Engelberg in the canton of Obwalden (OW). North and above of Meiringen is the ski and hiking resort Hasliberg just on the other side of the ski resort Melchsee-Frutt (OW). The low Brünig Pass to the north connects Meiringen and the Haslital with the upper canton of Obwalden and further down to Central Switzerland and Lucerne (LU).\n\nAbove of Brienz on the northeastern shore of Lake Brienz soars the Brienzer Rothorn, the highest summit of the prominent mountain range dominating the north shore of the Lake Brienz as far as its western end above Interlaken with the Harder. On the north side of the Brienzer Rothorn lies the resort Sörenberg in the Mariental in canton of Lucerne (LU).\n\nSouth of Interlaken the short valley of the Lütschine opens to the most well-known valleys of the Bernese Highlands, namely the Lauterbrunnental to the south, and the valley of the Schwarze Lütschine to the east with Grindelwald situated just below the Eiger, Schreckhorn, and Wetterhorn. Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen are separated by the \"Kleine Scheidegg\" pass, which is accessible from both sides via a rack railway, and which is the starting point of the Jungfrau Railway to the Jungfraujoch, a saddle between the Jungfrau and Mönch (literally, German \"Joch\" translates to \"yoke\").\n\nOn the southeastern side of the mountain range formed by Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau lies the head of the largest glacier of the Alps, the Aletsch Glacier, which however entirely lies on the soil of the canton of Valais (VS). Via the upper, southern end of the Lauterbrunnental the experienced hiker can reach the Kandertal by traversing the Tschingel and Kander Neve from northeast to southwest. West of the Lauterbrunnental the Schilthorn rises, separating the valley of the Weisse Lütschine from the Kiental. The Lauterbrunnen Valley is connected to the Kiental via the Sefinafurgga, a high Alpine hiking pass, and further to the Kander Valley via the Hohtürli, another high Alpine hiking pass, on the north flank of the Blümlisalp range.\n\nKandersteg, at the north entrance of the old Lötschberg Tunnel (1913, 14 km), which connects the Bernese Highlands with the German-speaking part of the Valais, opens up to the north to Frutigen where it is joined by the Entschligetal from the southwest, with the ski resort of Adelboden at its southern end. Adelboden and its sister resort Lenk join their respective areas to an extended and unified ski and hiking area across another mountain range. Lenk is situated at the southern end of the Obersimmental, the upper part of the Simmental, which again joins the Kander of the Kandertal just south of Spiez at the southern shore of Lake Thun after the Kander flows through the Frutigtal. Above Spiez rises the Niesen, offering a wide view over the Bernese part of the Swiss Plateau to the northwest.\n\nZweisimmen, still part of the Obersimmental, lies south of Boltigen, the junction of the upper and lower parts of the Simmental. From Erlenbach in the Niedersimmental, the lower valley of the Simme, one can access the Stockhorn by cable cars to the west, the one summit of the Bernese Oberland with the probably most unobstructive view over the Bernese Lowlands and Thun. Not far from Erlenbach, one can access the Diemtigtal to the south with the Gsür to its very south end, also rising directly above Adelboden.\n\nZweisimmen also connects to Saanen and Gstaad via the small pass of Saanenmöser, with the Louwene Valley and the upper valley of the Saane south of Gstaad. After flowing northwards, in Saanen the Saane turns to the west, firstly, in order to become \"La Sarine\" in the now French-speaking canton of Vaud (VD), and secondly, opens a railway connection to Montreux at the eastern shore of Lake Geneva.\n\nThe Jaun Pass, a road pass, connects the Simmental near Reidenbach with La Gruyère, the valley when \"La Sarine\" turns north again, and the town of Bulle in the canton of Fribourg (FR), west of the Lac de la Gruyère.\n\nNorth of Spiez, right across Lake Thun, on its northern shore, lies the Niederhorn, the south end of the northernmost mountain range of significant elevation of the Bernese Highlands, with the Gemmenalphorn and the Hohgant at the other end, separated by a small valley from the Harder on its southeast.\n\nAt the west end of Lake Thun, at the outlet of the river Aare, lies the town of Thun, which already belongs to the Swiss Plateau, not far from Bern to the northwest.\n\nSince 2010, the Berner Oberland covers one of five administrative regions of the canton of Berne (called ) and consists of four administrative districts with 80 municipalities:\n\n\nBefore 2010, the Oberland had consisted of the following districts:\n\n\nThe Berner Oberland is touristically known as \"Bernese Oberland\" and well known for touristic reasons, including the following destinations:\n\n\n\n"}

It was added to the World Heritage List together with seven other structures in Ravenna in 1996. Despite its common name, Galla Placidia was not buried in the building, a misconception dating from the thirteenth century; she died in Rome and was buried there, probably alongside Honorius in the mausoleum that became the Chapel of Saint Petronilla in Old Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe \"mausoleum\" of Galla Placidia, built 425-450, is a cruciform chapel or oratory that originally adjoined the narthex of the Church of the Holy Cross (\"Santa Croce\") in Ravenna. It was probably dedicated to Saint Lawrence.\n\nAelia Galla Placidia, the likely patron of the building's construction was the daughter of Theodosius I and Galla. Raised by Serena, wife of Flavius Stilicho, she was made \"nobillissima\" in her youth and granted a palace by her father in Constantinople. She received an advanced education both secular and religious, as is evident from her letters. She married Athaulf, King of the Visigoths in 414 in Spain after moving to the West, though he soon died and she married the \"patricius\" Constantius (later Constantius III) in 417. Their children were Justa Grata Honoria and Valentinian III. Constantius III was elevated as co-emperor of the West in 421 by Honorius, who lacked an heir, and Galla Placidia was made \"augusta\"; Constantius died the same year and Galla Placidia fled to Constantinople. When Honorius died in 423, the \"primicerius notariorum\" Joannes succeeded as \"augustus\" in the West; thereafter Theodosius II, \"augustus\" in the East, moved to instal Galla Placidia's son Valentinian as emperor in the West instead, appointing him \"caesar\".\n\nThe building dates from after 425; in that year the six-year old Valentinian III took office as \"augustus\" in 425 and Galla Placidia's title as \"augusta\" was again secured - she ruled as regent for her son for twelve years. Her political influence waned with the growing maturity of her son and the rise to prominence of the \"patricius\" Flavius Aëtius in the 430s, but she remained powerful until she died in 450. She was an active patron of religious institutions, building churches at Ravenna, Rome, and Jerusalem. She contributed to the refurbishment of Saint Paul's outside-the-walls (\"San Paolo fuori le Mura\"), as recorded in an inscription there.\n\nA basilica in Ravenna dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist (\"San Giovanni Evangelista\") was also built by Galla Placidia after 425; it commemorated the \"augusta\"'s and her children's deliverance from a threatening storm during a sea-voyage and was adorned with portraits of her and other members of the Theodosian dynasty. The basilica did not survive the Second World War. According to the mediaeval \"Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis\", an inscription on the apse of that basilica recorded the buildings status as an ex-voto in gratitude for Galla Placidia's survival at sea.\"\" The \"Liber Pontificalis\" also claims her burial was at the \"monasterium\" of Saint Nazarius at Ravenna\".\" This claim, originally probably made in Rome, is the probable origin of the misconception that Galla Placidia was buried in Ravenna, rather than in Rome, which culminated in the Ravennates' claim that she was buried in the chapel now known as her \"mausoleum\". \n\nThe building was formerly the oratory of the Church of the Holy Cross and now contains three sarcophagi.\n\nThe mausoleum was once connected to the narthex of Santa Croce, but now in ruins.\n\nThe mausoleum is laid out in a cruciform floor plan, with a central dome on pendentives and barrel vaults over the four transepts. The exterior of the dome is enclosed in a square tower that rises above the gabled lateral wings. The and decorated with blind arcades. Light enters through window panels.\n\nThe interior of the mausoleum is covered with rich mosaics. The inside contains two famous mosaic lunettes, and the rest of the interior is filled with mosaics of Christian and Apocalyptic symbols.\n\nMosaics composed of glass \"tesserae\" cover the interior walls of the vault, the lunettes and the cupola; the adornments are of high quality. Above the entrance portal is a mosaic depicting Christ as the Good Shepherd among his flock. The barrel-vaults of the four arms of the cruciform chapel bear vegetal mosaics consisting of acanthus and vine scrolls. In the western arm's lunette a mosaic represents deer approaching a spring, perhaps a reference to \"Psalm 42\", whose incipit is \"\"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\"\" In the southern transept's lunette is a mosaic depicting a male saint carrying a cross accompanied by a burning gridiron and an opened cabinet containing the four canonical Gospels, identified by the names of the Four Evangelists in Latin. Unidentified figures of white-robed martyrs decorate the lunettes of the east and west transepts. The interior of the dome at the centre is decorated as a starry sky, with a regular mosaic of golden stars on a dark blue background, with a gold cross represented at the apex of the dome and the four symbols of the Evangelists (or the \"living creatures\" of \"Revelation 4:7\") at the corner pendentives. The four lunettes below the dome, between the arches springing from the four central piers and the arches of the pendentives above them, have mosaics each depicting two Apostles with their right arms raised in acclamation likely directed at the male saint in the southern transept's mosaic.\n\nThe sky with stars or clouds was often depicted as decoration of domes, apses, and ceilings of churches. The basilica in Rome of Saint Pudentiana (\"Santa Pudenziana\"), built in the late 4th century, is an example predating Galla Placidia's building, while later buildings at Ravenna repeated the motif, including the Chapel of Saint Andrew (c\"apella Sant'Andrea\") in the Archiepiscopal Palace and the 6th century basilica of Saint Apollinaris in \"Classe\" (\"Sant'Apollinare in Classe\").\n\nThe figure of the Good Shepherd and pastoral scenes were familiar to Christian thought; depictions of a young man, the \"criophorus\", bearing on his shoulders a sheep were known in the ancient world from the 6th century BC and was adopted from the late 3rd century AD into Christian art, especially in funerary contexts. The shepherd was understood to represent Christ, as in \"John 10\":11-17 and \"Luke 15\":4-7. Here the beardless figure of the shepherd is in imperial garb, wearing purple and gold and bearing a cruciform staff in place of the usual shepherd's crook.\n\nThe art historian Gillian Mackie argues that this panel represents the Spanish Saint Vincent of Saragossa rather than the Italian Saint Lawrence. Mackie cites Galla's connection to Spain; in addition, St. Vincent was martyred by drowning at sea, and Galla and her children had been delivered from shipwreck. The panel seems to be an illustration of . In the poem St. Vincent is ordered to disclose his sacred books to be burned. This explains the cupboard containing the Gospels, which has no satisfactory explanation in the story of St. Lawrence.\nThe mausoleum is reputed to have inspired American songwriter Cole Porter to compose \"Night and Day\" while on a 1920s visit.\n\n\n"}

Howard Crane, who created other prominent theatres in Detroit including The Fillmore Detroit, the Fox Theater and the Detroit Symphony's Orchestra Hall. It opened on January 22, 1922.\n\nThe building underwent an extensive restoration which took place under the control of Detroit-based architectural design firm, Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. It reopened in 1996.\n\nOver the years, opera has been presented at a variety of venues in Detroit - the Old Detroit Opera House (1869–1963) at Campus Martius, the Whitney Grand Opera House (Garrick Theatre) at Griswold Street and Michigan Avenue, and the New Detroit Opera House (1886–1928) at Randolph and Monroe Streets.\n\nThe Nederlander Organization, a major theatrical producer, began in Detroit with a 99-year lease on the Old Detroit Opera House in 1912.\n\nThe present Detroit Opera House opened in 1922 and was known as the \"Capitol Theatre\". It was among the first of several performance venues built around Detroit's Grand Circus Park. When it opened, the Capitol was reportedly the fifth largest movie theater in the world, seating about 3,500 people. In 1929, the Capitol Theater became the Paramount Theater, and in 1934, the Broadway Capitol Theater.\n\nDuring the first few decades of its history the theater presented feature films along with live entertainment including artists such as jazz legends Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. Later the Broadway Capitol converted to a movies-only policy. Following a minor restoration in the 1960s, the building became the 3,367-seat Grand Circus Theatre. The theater closed in 1978 after surviving several years exhibiting second-run and soft-core porn films. It reopened again briefly in 1981, but closed after a minor fire in 1985 caused damage.\n\nIn 1988, the Michigan Opera Theatre purchased the building and dubbed it the \"Detroit Opera House\", after an extensive restoration and stage expansion. The reopening in 1996 was celebrated with a gala event featuring Luciano Pavarotti and other noted artists. The Detroit Opera House is now configured with seating for an audience of 2,700. Since 1996, the opera house has annually hosted five opera productions, five dance productions from touring companies, and a variety of other musical and comedy events.\n\nThe Opera House is featured prominently in the 2012 documentary \"Detropia\"\n\nNote: The name \"Grand Circus Theatre\" may cause confusion, since another Grand Circus Theatre (1913–1924), originally known as the Central Theatre, once stood at 2115 Woodward Avenue.

Like Herophilus, Galen, Ibn al-Nafis, Michael Servetus, Realdo Colombo and William Harvey, he is credited as making a discovery in the circulation of the blood. He is said to have discovered the function of the valves in the circulation of the blood.\n\nLusitano was born in 1511 in Castelo Branco, Portugal. He was a descendant of a Marrano family called \"Chabib\" (= \"Amatus\", \"beloved\" in Latin), and was brought up in the Jewish faith. After having graduated with honors as M.D. from the University of Salamanca, he was unable to return Portugal for fear of the Inquisition. He went to Antwerp for a time and then traveled through the Netherlands and France, finally settling in Italy. His reputation as one of the most skilful physicians of his time preceded him there, and during his short sojourn at Venice, where he came in contact with the physician and philosopher Jacob Mantino, he attended the niece of Pope Julius III and other distinguished personages.\n\nIn 1546, Amato was in Ferrara, at whose University he taught anatomy as an assistant to the physician Giambattista Canano and delivered lectures on medicinal plants. During one lecture, he dissected twelve cadavers — a great innovation at that time — in the presence of many scholars, among whom was the anatomist Jean Baptiste Cananus, who through his experience on this occasion was wrongly credited with the discovery of the function of the valves in the circulation of the blood. During his sojourn in Ferrara, which lasted for six years, Amatus Lusitanus received an invitation from the King of Poland to move to that country, which he declined, preferring to settle in Ancona, where religious tolerance existed.\n\nMeanwhile, his reputation grew higher and higher. Jacoba del Monte, sister of Pope Julius III, was one of his patients; and he prescribed also for Julius himself, to whose sick-bed he was later summoned.\n\nWith the accession of Paul IV, Amatus underwent all the sufferings which the Marranos of Ancona had to endure from this pope. He took refuge in Pesaro, leaving behind him all his possessions, including several manuscript works, the loss of which he greatly deplored. One of these manuscripts, however, the fifth part of his \"Centuriæ\", was later restored to him and published. During his sojourn at Pesaro he received an invitation from the municipality of Ragusa, After staying for some months he left the city for Thessaloniki, which then had a large Jewish community and was part of the Ottoman Empire; there he openly professed the Jewish faith and finally died in 1568.\n\nHe discovered the circulation of the blood, and through dissections of the Azygos vein, he was the first to observe and speculate about the venous valves found there.\n\nThis discovery contradicted the conventional belief of the time that the blood flows from the heart via the arteries as well as the veins. It is obvious that this hypothesis was supported by the fact that the network of arteries and veins becomes thinner and thinner as they get farther from the heart. It was also assumed that the networks are not connected, so the blood cannot pass from one network to the other. (The microscope was not yet invented, so one could not view capillary arteries without aid.)\n\nDr. Amatus Lusitanus described in the Centuria I, paragraph (Curatio) 513, how, in 1547, he performed an experiment before some scholars from the University of Ferrara. He blew air into the lower part of the azygos, and showed that the vena cava would not be inflated. It was not possible for the air to escape because of the valve or operculum mentioned. When it is clear that if air cannot pass out of the azygos into the vena cava, it is all the more certain that blood, much thicker than air, could not flow through. In the audience was \"the admirable anatomist” Giambattista Canano, to whom the discovery of the valves was attributed later by mistake.\n\nAmatus enriched medical literature with several valuable works which for a long time enjoyed the highest reputation. Among these the most important was his \"Centuriæ\", in which he published accounts of his cases and their treatment. This work, in seven volumes, entitled \"Curationum Medicinalium Centuriæ Septem\", passed through a number of editions (Florence, 1551; Venice, 1552, 1557, 1560, 1653; Basel, 1556; Leyden, 1560, 1570; Paris, 1620; Bordeaux, 1620; Barcelona, 1628). His other works were: \"Index Dioscoridis\" (1536); \"Enegemata in Duos Priores Dioscoridis de Arte Medica Libros\" (Antwerp, 1536); \"In Dioscorides de Medica materia Librum quinque enarrationis\" (1556); \"Commentatio de Introitu Medici ad Ægrotantem\", (Venice, 1557); \"De Crisi et Diebus Decretoriis\", (Venice, 1557); \"In Dioscoridis Anazarbei de Medica Materia Libros Quinque\", (Venice, 1557; Leyden, 1558); \"Enarrationes Eruditissimæ\", (Venice, 1553); \"La Historia de Eutropio\" (Eutropius translated into Spanish); commentary on the first book of Avicenna's Canon, which, as he relates in the preface to the seventh \"Centuria\", he lost among his possessions at Ancona.\n\n\n"}

Derrida's \"Circumfession\" is, among other things, intended to show how Derrida's work exceeds Bennington's explication: by introducing details about his own circumcision and its possible meanings Derrida shows the impossibility of such a regulated database of his writings. Many of Bennington's essays on Derrida collected in \"Legislations, Interrupting Derrida\", and \"Not Half No End\", have criticized explanations of Derrida's work attempted by other scholars. Bennington has also written two monographs on Lyotard, \"Writing the Event\" and \"Late Lyotard\", and has also written extensively on Rousseau and Kant, developing original accounts of the \"paradox of the legislator\" in the former and \"interrupted teleology\" in the latter. He is currently writing a deconstructive account of political philosophy.\n\nHe has translated a number of works by Derrida and others, and is General Editor (with Peggy Kamuf) of the English translations of Derrida's posthumously published seminars.\n\nHe has at times tried to engage members of the British press hostile to Derrida's work and has also attempted to explicate the relationship between deconstruction and analytic philosophy, which has generally had difficulties receiving work by Derrida and others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is conservative and francophilic. It is the third biggest political party in the National Assembly and forms part of Opposition.\n\nFounded in 1956 by Jules Koenig, the Mauritian Social Democratic Party is one of the oldest parties in the country. It was known as the Mauritian Union from 1946 to 1956. After the post-colonial era, the PMSD was led by Sir Gaetan Duval from 1967 to 1995. The PMSD is known as the only significant political party which was not in favour of Independence from Great Britain for Mauritius. It started out with a large following in the minority communities such as General Population (Creoles, Chinese and Whites) and Muslims. \n\nHowever with the advent of the newly formed MMM in the 1970s, PMSD started to lose popularity. It won 23 seats in the pre-Independence 1967 general elections; at the 1976 elections, it retained only 7 (plus an eighth indirectly elected member). Despite this apparent shrinkage in its base the PMSD managed to form part of ruling government from 1976 to 1982 after contracting an alliance with the Labour Party after the 1976 elections. \n\nSoon after the 1968 Independence there was disagreement within the PMSD, which formed part of most of the Opposition in Parliament, regarding the growing rapprochement between the PMSD leader Sir Gaëtan Duval and the Labour leader Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. As a result in 1969 a splinter group was formed within PMSD and it was led by Maurice Lesage and Guy Ollivry who had been prominent figures of the PMSD. As a result Maurice Lesage, Guy Ollivry, Raymond Rivet, Cyril Leckning, Clément Roussety and others left PMSD and created their own party Union Démocratique Mauricienne (UDM) which remained active for a number of years thereafter. \nIn the 1990s Gaëtan Duval left PMSD and formed his own splinter party called Parti Gaëtan Duval. In 1999 Xavier-Luc Duval also left PMSD to form his new party Parti Mauricien Xavier Duval. \n\nIn 2000 the PMSD formed part of the historical MSM/MMM alliance as a minority party. It joined the Labour Party-led Social Alliance, which included other allies. \n\nIn 2009 the PMSD merged with the Parti Mauricien Xavier Duval (PMXD) and retained its old name \"PMSD\". However Xavier Luc Duval became leader and Maurice Allet became president of the party. The PMSD renewed its focus on the Mauritian Creole community and remained a close ally of the Mauritian Labour Party. \n\nIn the lead up to elections of 2014, however, the PMSD joined the Alliance Lepep, a coalition comprising the Militant Socialist Movement, the Muvman Liberater, and itself. It won 11 seats.\n\nLeading to the November 2019 elections the PMSD joined forces with its historical ally Labour Party to form an alliance called \"Alliance Nationale\". This alliance secured 14 seats in the Parliament. \n"}
{"id": "1826511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826511", "title": "Militant Socialist Movement", "text": "Militant Socialist Movement\n\nThe Militant Socialist Movement (; abbreviated MSM) is a centre-left political party in Mauritius that adheres to the philosophies of socialism and political democracy. It is the largest single political party in the National Assembly of Mauritius, winning 34 of the 69 seats in the 2014 general elections. With political development, 6 MPs from the opposition joined officially the party making the current majority at 40. It also holds the largest number of seats in all city/town councils through the country with 60 councilors out of 120.\n\nThe MSM is one of the three biggest political parties in the country, the others being the Labour Party (PTR) and Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM).\n\nThe MSM has won, either alone or as part of a coalition, five of the eleven elections in Mauritius since independence (in 1983, 1987, 1991, 2000, and 2014. It draws most of its support from the country's Hindu majority.\n\nThe MSM was founded in 1983 by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, who has been Prime Minister three times, for a total of sixteen years (1982-1995, 2000-2003, and again since 2014). He was also President from 2003 to 2012. He led the MSM from 1983 to 2003, when his son Pravind Jugnauth, officially assumed the leadership. Pravind Jugnauth served as Vice Prime Minister in his father's cabinet. Other members of the Jugnauth family have also been politically active, including Lall Jugnauth (a former Attorney General), Ashok Jugnauth (former Minister of Health) and Maya Hanoomanjee (also former Minister of Health).\n\nAs of 2011, the front bench of the MSM is composed of four members, namely Pravind Jugnauth (Leader), Nando Bodha (Secretary General), Showkatally Soodhun (President), and Leela Devi Dookhun (Vice President).\n\nThe Militant Socialist Movement emerged in 1983 out of the split between the leaders of the two main parties comprising the coalition government - the MMM founder Paul Bérenger and the Parti Socialiste Mauricien (PSM) leader, Harish Boodhoo. Bérenger proposed a constitutional amendment to transfer the executive powers of the Prime Minister to the Cabinet as a collective body. Prime Minister Jugnauth \n, a member of the MMM, rejected Bérenger's proposal and was supported by Boodhoo. Bérenger sought a parliamentary vote of no confidence to replace Jugnauth with Prem Nababsing, but Jugnauth abruptly dissolved the National Assembly before it had a chance to vote. The MMM split, with Jugnauth and his supporters merging with Boodhoo's MSP to form the MSM. The MSM, in an electoral pact with the Labour Party and the PMSD, went on to win the ensuring election and Jugnauth remained in office. In 1985, four members of the MSM were arrested in the Netherlands and charged with smuggling heroin. The MSM won the 1987 election with the same partners, and the 1991 election in a coalition with the MMM.\n\nThe coalition with the MMM turned out to be only a temporary rapproachment. In the leadup to the election expected to be held in 1996, the MMM left the government and formed an alliance with the Labour Party. Several MSM Members of Parliament also defected to the opposition, putting the Jugnauth administration under increasing strain. The elections ended up being brought forward to 1995. The opposition Labour-MMM coalition won all 60 seats, leaving the MSM without parliamentary representation. Navin Ramgoolam of the Labour Party became Prime Minister.\n\nThe Labour-MMM coalition subsequently broke up, and for the 2000 election, the MMM agreed to a pact with the MSM, providing that Jugnauth would serve as Prime Minister for three years. He would then resign and assume the presidency, handing the office of Prime Minister over to Paul Bérenger, the MMM leader. The MSM/MMM alliance won 54 of the 60 seats, and, as per the agreement, Jugnauth became Prime Minister and was succeeded by Bérenger in 2003. Bérenger led this coalition, which now included the PMSD, to defeat in the 2005 elections, however, and Ramgoolam became Prime Minister again. In 2010, the MSM joined the Labour-led Alliance de L'Avenir, which won the election, and Ramgoolam remained Prime Minister, with Pravind Jugnauth of the MSM as his Deputy.\n\nBy 2014, politics had realigned yet again. The MSM left the government to oppose the Labor Party, which now joined forces with the MMM instead. The MSM contested that year's election as part of the Alliance Lepep, which also included the PMSD and the Muvman Liberater; the alliance won 47 of the 60 directly elected mainland seats. Jugnauth, now 84, became Prime Minister again, even though his son Pravind Jugnauth was officially the party leader.\n\nThe MSM allied itself with two parties, the Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate (PMSD) and the Muvman Liberater (ML) which won another 18 seats, giving the MSM-led Alliance Lepep a clear majority of 51 seats in the 70-member parliament . It also hold 17 of the 25 positions in the Cabinet.\n\nEach party put the a number of candidates for each general elections. There are 60 Mauritian constituency seats directly elected plus 10 that is combination of Rodrigues seats (2) and best losers(8) to ensure equal ethnic representation.\n\n"}

Kennedy Surface Road, with the Central Artery (I-93) passing underneath in the Dewey Square Tunnel and Big Dig. South Station is on the southeast corner of the square, with Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail services, as well as Red Line subway trains and Silver Line bus rapid transit underneath.\n\nIt is named for the only Admiral of the Navy in U.S. history, George Dewey.\n\nThe square was named in honor of Admiral George Dewey after his decisive 1898 victory in the Battle of Manila Bay. Before the Central Artery demolition of the 1950s, it was simply an intersection with traffic islands and rail infrastructure, surrounded by buildings with no open space. In 1898, Summer Street was extended east as a local road, and in 1899 the Summer Street Bridge was built across Fort Point Channel. Also in 1899, Federal Street was closed south of Dewey Square to make way for the new South Station, and Atlantic Avenue was extended along the west side of the new terminal along with a realignment of the Union Freight Railroad. Around this time, the Boston Elevated Railway reorganized its streetcar tracks into a grand union at the intersection of Summer and Atlantic. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated came in 1901 with an elevated station (also called South Station) one block south of Dewey Square. It was closed in 1938 and torn down in the early 1940s; the Union Freight Railroad lasted until 1970.\n\nThe next major change came in the 1950s when the Central Artery was built. The whole area on the north and south sides of the square was cleared, and the Artery was built underground via the Dewey Square Tunnel. Atlantic Avenue became one-way northbound and Purchase Street one way southbound to the north of the square, and the new Surface Artery came in as a two-way road above the tunnel heading southwest from the square. Between 1969 and 1978, Boston closed both Federal Street and Summer Street for a block west of the square (they had formerly operated as a one-way pair). Summer Street has since reopened (as a two-way road), but Federal Street is still a pedestrian mall.\n\nThe Big Dig in the late 1990s and early 2000s kept the one-way configurations north of the square, but now Atlantic Avenue continues as one-way (northbound) south of the square, and Surface Artery is one-way southbound.\n\nFor some time, a temporary intercity bus depot for providers such as Peter Pan, Trailways and others was located just north of Dewey Square over the Central Artery. This temporary bus station replaced an earlier Trailways bus station that had been located in Park Square. All intercity buses were relocated in 1993 to the nearby South Station Bus Terminal just south of South Station, situated above the train tracks.\n\nThe area is now largely an open plaza at the southern end of the Rose Kennedy Greenway, which features food trucks and a seasonal farmer's market operated by the Boston Public Market.\n\nFrom September 30 to December 10, 2011, Dewey Square was the site of the Occupy Boston tent city.\n\n\n"}

The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps (NSAK), which had existed since April 1930.\n\nThe NSKK served as a training organization, mainly instructing members in the operation and maintenance of high-performance motorcycles and automobiles. The NSKK was further used to transport NSDAP and SA officials/members. The NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group in the mid-1930s, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. With the outbreak of World War II NSKK ranks were recruited to serve in the transport corps of various German military branches. There was also a French section of the NSKK which was organized after the German occupation of France began in 1940. The NSKK was the smallest of the Nazi Party organizations.\n\nThe National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK) was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps (NSAK), which had existed since being formed on 1 April 1930. Legends about the actual emergence of the NSKK go back as far as 1922, when the publisher of the \"Völkischer Beobachter\" (People's Observer) and founding member of the German Workers' Party (DAP), Dietrich Eckart, allegedly purchased trucks so the SA could perform their missions and transport propaganda materials. Martin Bormann founded the NSAK, which itself was the successor to the SA Motor Squadrons (\"Kraftfahrstaffeln\"). Hitler made the NSAK an official Nazi organization on 1 April 1930. The NSAK was responsible for co-ordinating the use of donated motor vehicles belonging to party members, and later expanded to training members in automotive skills. Adolf Hühnlein was appointed \"Korpsführer\" (Corps Leader) of the NSAK, which was to serve primarily as a motorized corps of the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA). Hühnlein became the organization's \"nucleus\".\n\nThe organization's name was changed to the National Socialist Motor Corps (\"Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps\"; NSKK), becoming official on 1 May 1931. It was essentially a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks and the smallest of the NSDAP organizations. Despite its relatively smaller size, when the Nazis celebrated \"Braunschweiger\" SA-day on 18 October 1931, the NSKK had upwards of 5,000 vehicles at its disposal to move men and materials.\n\nThe primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills or what was called \"fitness in motoring skills\" (\"motorische Ertüchtigung\"), but it also transported NSDAP and SA officials. In the mid-1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association.\n\nMembership in the NSKK did not require any prior knowledge of automobiles. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did adhere to Nazi racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. Under the guidance of the police, numerous NSKK men were stationed at traffic junctions and trained in traffic control.\nOn 20 July 1934, three weeks after the major purge the SA suffered during the Night of the Long Knives, the NSKK was separated and promoted into an independent NSDAP organization. From 1935 onward, the NSKK also provided training for Panzer crews and drivers of the \"Heer\" (German Army). The NSKK had two sub-branches within the organization known as the Motor-Hitler Youth (\"Motor-Hitlerjugend\"; Motor-HJ) and Naval NSKK (\"Marine-NSKK\"). The Motor-HJ branch was formed by \"Reichsjugendführer\" (Hitler Youth Leader) Baldur von Schirach after he became a member of the NSKK. It operated 350 of its own vehicles for educational and training purposes. The Naval NSKK trained men in the operation and maintenance of boats.\n\nDuring the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the NSKK assumed responsibility for a variety of transport tasks, proving themselves effective at political propaganda by transporting foreign visitors around on designated tours. By 1938, NSKK members were undergoing mechanical and operational training for both civilian and military type vehicles. Over time, the training at NSKK schools became primarily focused on military related tasks. For services to the NSKK and due in part to the general success of the NSKK, Hühnlein was promoted to the position of a \"Reichsleiter\" of the NSDAP in 1938. Hühnlein was NSKK \"Korpsführer\" from 1931 until his death in 1942, when Erwin Kraus took over.\n\nSometime in August 1938, the NSKK began its services as a courier for \"Organization Todt\" (OT) during the construction of the \"Westwall\". Members of the NSKK transported classified documents, important reports and announcements, construction plans, and routine papers to and from the organization's headquarters. Exemplary services provided to the Organization Todt resulted in Hühnlein being given oversight for the transportation needs related to the task. Over 15,000 trucks went into operation, delivering building materials to the 22,000 individual construction sites of the \"Westwall\". Daily movements of the 200,000 workers required over 5,000 buses to get the workers to and from the construction sites.\n\nConcomitant to the support provided to Organization Todt during the construction of the \"Westwall\" by the NSKK, the organization was also tasked by Hitler's chief architect, Albert Speer. He founded a unit known as the \"Transport Brigade Speer\", which was organized under the auspices of military considerations, dividing them accordingly into regiments, divisions, companies and platoons. On 27 January 1939, Hitler made the NSKK the sole authority for motor-vehicle related military training. Shortly thereafter, the NSKK was divided into 5 main groups and 23 subordinate motor groups. Approximate manpower strength of the NSKK reached nearly half a million men at this stage with its leadership operating primarily out of Munich and Berlin.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II in Europe on 1 September 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target for army recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, a coveted skill when the bulk of German ground forces relied on horses. The NSKK was used to transport German Army troops, supplies and ammunition. By the time the Second World War began, the NSKK had already trained some 200,000 men at its 21 training facilities.\n\nDuring field operations in the Eastern Front, the NSKK members of the Transport Brigade Speer followed Army Group South, providing infrastructural backup and replenishment. Members of the Transport Brigade Speer wore either the gray-blue uniform of the Luftwaffe or the brown uniform of Speer's staff. NSKK men working for Organization Todt became members of the \"NSKK Transport Brigade Todt\", which were further divided into individual motor groups in the occupied territories.\n\nMajor units of the NSKK were formed by 1944, operating throughout Germany. There were two full brigades of the NSKK supporting the Luftwaffe; a \"Motorobergruppe Alpenland\" in the Austrian Alps; \"Motorobergruppe Mitte\" (middle) which operated in Berlin, Franconia, and the Lower Rhine; \"Motorobergruppe Nord\" (north) that covered Hamburg, Lower Saxony, the Baltic Sea and Schleswig-Holstein; \"Motorobergruppe Nordost\" (northeast) in Danzig, East Prussia, and Wartheland; \"Motorobergruppe Ost\" (east) for Leipzig, Lower and Upper Silesia; \"Motorobergruppe Süd\" (south) which served Bavaria and Hochland; \"Motorobergruppe Südwest\" (southwest) for the Rhine-Moselle, and Swabian regions; \"Motorobergruppe Südost\" (southeast) covering the Upper and Lower Danube, Sudetenland; and \"Motorobergruppe West\" (west) which was responsible for Hessen, Thuringia, and Westphalia. Moreover, there were also NSKK units assigned to Organization Todt, operating in France, Italy and Russia. Historian Peter Longerich suggests that members of the NSKK along with the para-military police, the Waffen-SS, and the German Army were all culpable in varying degrees for large-scale arrests, torture, and mass executions.\n\nThe French section of the NSKK began shortly after the German occupation of France in 1940. However, the section was not officially recognized until July 1942. The main office was in Paris, but recruitment occurred throughout France. By the end of 1942 there was one company of 200 men; by the end of World War II there had been seven companies raised. The men had to sign up for two years of service. The French NSKK was originally attached to the Luftwaffe, although they wore the standard NSKK uniforms and used its rank system. They did have their own arm badge with the colors of the French flag. The first version had \"NSKK\" in black letters across the top of the shield; the second version had the word \"France\" in black letters across the top of the shield.\n\nThe original unit was officially known as \"NSKK Gruppe Luftwaffe\" and a second one was known as \"NSKK Transportgruppe Todt\". At Melun, the NSKK had its own driving school for French recruits and others from European countries. Before the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) began to openly recruit members into the Waffen-SS, Frenchmen used the NSKK as a \"back-door\" to get into the Waffen-SS to fight on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. Some French NSKK men were sent to the Eastern Front in a group known as \"NSKK Einsatzgruppe Russland\".\n\nIn September 1944, the \"Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS \"Charlemagne\"\", was formed. It was formed from the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism or LVF and the \"SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade France\". Joining them were French collaborators fleeing the Allied advance in the west, as well as Frenchmen from the German Navy, the NSKK, the \"Organisation Todt\" and the detested \"Milice\" security police. In February 1945, the \"Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS \"Charlemagne\"\" was officially upgraded to a division and became known as the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS \"Charlemagne\" (1st French).\n\nThe NSKK was the smallest of the Nazi Party organizations. The Corps was disbanded in May 1945 and the group was declared a \"condemned organization\" at the Nuremberg Trials (although not a criminal one). This was due in part to the NSKK's origins in the SA and the racial requirements for membership.\n\n\n"}

During 1971 and first half of 1972, Arman Sumpe D.E. was on an ever-lasting concert tour throughout Norway playing more than 140 concerts. Jahn performed at one of Europe's two largest music festivals, the Roskilde Festival, in 1972 he became one of the major attractions as part of Popol Vuh (credited as Arman Sumpe). He had previously performed in Roskilde at the Fjordvilla Club in 1968 with the band Red Squares.\n\nJahn Teigen was a member of the Norwegian humour trio Prima Vera, with Herodes Falsk and Tom Mathisen, who released seven albums between 1977 and 1984. Most of their repertoire consists of popular hits with the most ridiculous lyrics. (This struck a chord with the Norwegian audience, since, at the time, to ensure airplay, English-language songs often were re-recorded with Norwegian lyrics.) Their breakthrough album, 1978s \"Brakara\", went to number 1 in the charts and sold more than 100,000 copies, and includes Teigen's spirited mock-Russian rendition of Mil Etter Mil, \"Zagra Znja Zagra\". This 30-second version is the only available recording of the original arrangement; whether in English or Norwegian, Jahn Teigen's serious recordings of the song feature more electric guitar. The serious version was also a huge hit, making Teigen one of the few performers ever to have success with both a serious version and a parody of the same song simultaneously. Prima Vera had a number of hits, including such classics as \"Så lykkelig i Sverige\" ('So happy in Sweden', a version of The Turtles' \"Happy Together\"), \"Det er Norge som er bra\" and \"De gærne har det godt\". Teigen decided to leave the band in 1984.\n\nIn 1978 in Paris Jahn Teigen made his first appearance on the Eurovision stage, performing the song \"Mil etter mil\" (\"Mile after mile\"), which became famous for not receiving a single point from any of the participating nations. This was the first occurrence of zero points with the new, and current, voting system of the Eurovision Song Contest. Despite the obvious lack of international recognition, the song gained a huge audience back in Norway where his countrymen embraced it. The single dominated the national singles chart for more than four months, being among the ten most-bought singles for no less than 19 consecutive weeks, for five of those also topping the chart for the most popular international hit of the nation. Still, having been in the nation's spotlight for more than 30 years, this remains his most successful hit. Teigen's runner-up single was called \"Jeg gi'kke opp\", meaning \"I don't give up\", and his first album release the same year was just as self-ironic, as it was entitled \"This Year's Loser\".\n\nJahn Teigen returned to the Eurovision stage in 1982 in Harrogate, United Kingdom, where he sang \"Adieu\" in duet with Anita Skorgan (to whom he was married 1984-1988 and with whom he has a daughter) ending up at 12th place. In 1983, in Munich, Germany, he went solo again, with Anita Skorgan and three other women as backing vocals, with the melody \"Do re mi\", composed together with Anita Skorgan, which gave him his best position, a respectable 9th place. He took part in the Norwegian national Eurovision final, called the \"Melodi Grand Prix\", a record fourteen times: in 1974 (\"Hvor er du\"), 1975 (\"Kjærlighetens under\"), 1976 (\"Hastverk\" and \"Voodoo\"), 1978 (\"Mil etter mil\"), 1980 (\"Ja\"), 1982 (with Anita Skorgan \"Adieu\"), 1983 (\"Do Re Mi\"), 1988 (\"Glasnost\"), 1989 (\"Optimist\"), 1990 (\"Smil\"), 1993 (\"Jackpot\"), 1994 (\"Gi alt vi har\"), 1996 (as part of the duo \"To Tenorer\" with \"Ariel\") and once again as late as in 2005 with \"My Heart Is My Home\".\nIn addition to this, Teigen was the host of Melodi Grand Prix and provided the interval act of the Melodi Grand Prix on a number of occasions. He also acted as commentator for Norwegian television in 1991 in Rome, together with John Andreassen.\n\nTeigen has released 17 albums as a soloist as of 1 January 2006. Six of these were best of collections, the last two being \"Jahn Teigens beste\" in 1994 and \"Fra null til gull\" (\"From nul till gold\" or \"From zero to hero\" as Teigen stated he would call an English release) in 2004, celebrating his 35+ years as popular artist. His most successful albums to date were \"En dags pause\" (\"One day's break\") released in 1979, \"Mentalkrem\" (\"Mental cream\") in 1980 and \"Klovn uten scene\" (\"Clown without stage\") in 1988.\n\nIn 1992 he took the part of the Executioner in the London run of the heavily panned Norwegian opera-musical \"Which Witch\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

By the 1930s they were offering round the world passenger/cargo services, with the passenger fare on a freighter £100. Entirely on foreign service, the ships did not include UK ports of call. Managing owners were the S & J Thompson family. Most of their merchant ships bore the name Silver followed by the name of a tree. The Second World War claimed 11 of their ships. One of them, the \"Silverfir\", was sunk by the German battleship on a voyage from Manchester to New York in 1941. Silver Line switched to tramping around the world in the 1950s, then went through several ownership changes, and by 1985, with the sale of their last ship, was no more.\n\nThe \"Silverplane\", a sleek twin funnel vessel of 7,226 gross tons built in 1948, was sold to the Cunard Line in 1951 and renamed \"Alsatia II\", and so was her sister ship \"Silverbriar\", to become \"Andria I\". Their forward funnels were false, containing the chart room and the captain's cabin, looked like miniature s, and carried just 12 passengers, the maximum allowed without a regulation onboard doctor. They were sold to the Republic of China and renamed \"Union Freedom\" and \"Union Faith\" respectively. The latter ship was demolished in a fiery collision with an oil barge outside New Orleans in 1969, with considerable loss of life.\n\nAn associated company, Joseph L. Thompson & Sons of Sunderland, was involved in the design of the first Liberty ships that saw service in World War II and beyond.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Silver Line had a fleet of chemical tankers carrying many types of (often hazardous) cargoes; from sulphuric acid to tetraethyllead. These ships often traded in the Baltic region. They were usually called \"Silver\"- plus the name of a bird of prey (e.g. \"Silvermerlin\", \"Silverosprey\", etc.). Promotion on these ships could be very rapid for those officers prepared to serve regularly on them. Captains of 25 years of age were not uncommon.\n\nThe company also had bulk carriers, tankers, OBOs and general cargo ships. The \"Silvermain\" and \"Silverfjord\" were on a regular run between Japan and the USA, carrying grain one way and Toyota cars the other.\n\n\n"}

Artur Axmann succeeded Schirach as national leader of the Hitler Youth on 8 August 1940.\n\nWith the surrender of Nazi Germany, the Hitler Youth was disbanded by Allied authorities as part of the denazification process. Both Schirach and Axmann were condemned as war criminals by the leading Allies powers after the end of the Second World War in Europe, in particular for the role the two played in corrupting the minds of children.

His medical writings were influential, and he built up a sizeable botanic garden in what is now West Ham Park in London.\n\nFothergill was born at Carr End, near Bainbridge in Yorkshire, the son of John Fothergill (1676–1745), a Quaker preacher and farmer, and his first wife, Margaret Hough (1677–1719). After studying at Sedbergh School, Fothergill was apprenticed to an apothecary. He later took the degree of M. D. at Edinburgh, in 1736, followed by further studies at St Thomas's Hospital, London. After visiting continental Europe in 1740, he settled in London, where he gained an extensive practice. For example, during the epidemics of influenza in 1775 and 1776 he is said to have treated sixty patients a day.\n\nIn 1745, he gave a brief lecture to the Royal Society of London, citing the work of a Scottish physician and surgeon, William Tossach (c. 1700 – 1771), which is the first known lecture on the practice of mouth-to-mouth ventilation. He is credited with first identifying and naming trigeminal neuralgia in his work \"Of a Painful Affection of the Face\" in 1773.\n\nFothergill's pamphlet, \"Account of the Sore Throat attended with Ulcers\" (1748), contains one of the first descriptions of streptococcal sore throat in English, and was translated into several languages. His rejection of ineffective traditional therapies for this disease saved many lives. He also supported the publication of Benjamin Franklin's papers on electricity, and wrote a preface for them.\n\nIn his leisure, John Fothergill made a study of conchology and botany. In 1762 he bought Upton House near Stratford, London and in its grounds he built up an extensive botanical garden and grew many rare plants obtained from various parts of the world (now West Ham Park). In the garden, with its glasshouses, John Coakley Lettsom (1744–1815), a Quaker physician and a protégé of his, exclaimed that \"the sphere seemed transposed, as the Arctic Circle joined with the equator\". Lettsom published a catalogue of the plants of Fothergill's garden \"Hortus Uptonensis, or a catalogue of the plants in the Dr. Fothergill’s garden at Upton, at the time of his decease anno 1780\". \"Fothergilla\" is named in his honour. \n\nFothergill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1763. He was the patron of Sydney Parkinson, the South Sea voyager, and also of William Bartram, the American botanist in his Southern travels 1773–76. A translation of the Bible, known as the Quaker Bible (1764 sq.) by Anthony Purver, a Quaker, was made and printed at his expense. He founded Ackworth School, Pontefract, Yorkshire in 1779.\n\nJohn Fothergill died in London on 26 December 1780, aged 68, of urinary retention perhaps linked with prostate cancer. Fanny Burney, having earlier described him as \"an upright, stern old man... an old prig,\" later recorded when she was his patient, \"He really has been… amazingly civil and polite to me … as kind as he is skilful.\" His niece Betty Fothergill described him in her journal as \"surely the first of men. With the becoming dignity of age he unites the cheerfulness and liberality of youth. He possesses the most virtues and the fewest failings of any man I know\".\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}
{"id": "1826559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826559", "title": "Pipe smoking", "text": "Pipe smoking\n\nPipe smoking is the practice of tasting (or, less commonly, inhaling) the smoke produced by burning a substance, most commonly tobacco, in a pipe. It is the oldest traditional form of smoking. Although it has declined somewhat in popularity it is still widely practiced and is very common in some parts of Scandinavia.\n\nRegular pipe smoking is known to carry serious health risks including increased danger of various forms of cancer as well as pulmonary and cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nA number of Native American cultures have pipe-smoking traditions, which have been part of their cultures since long before the arrival of Europeans. Tobacco is often smoked, generally for ceremonial purposes, though other mixtures of sacred herbs are also common. Various types of ceremonial pipes have been smoked in ceremony to seal covenants and treaties, most notably treaties of peace (hence the misnomer, \"peace pipe\"). Tobacco was introduced to Europe from the Americas in the sixteenth century and spread around the world rapidly.\nIn Asia during the nineteenth century, opium (which previously had only been eaten) was added to tobacco and smoked in pipes. Madak (the mixture of opium and tobacco) turned out to be far more addictive than orally-ingested opium, leading to social problems in China which culminated in the First (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860).\n\nAccording to Alfred Dunhill, Africans have had a long tradition of smoking hemp in gourd pipes, asserting that by 1884 the King of the Baluka tribe of the Congo had established a \"riamba\" or hemp-smoking cult in place of fetish-worship. Enormous gourd pipes were used.\n\nIn the twentieth century, pipe smoking was adopted as a preferred method of inhaling a variety of psychoactive drugs, and some claim it is a more intense method of ingestion. Smokeable crack cocaine has a reputation for being more addictive than cocaine's insufflated form. Similarly, methamphetamine has gained popularity in a crystalline form which when smoked in a pipe lets the user avoid the painful nasal irritation of snorting. When not applied to a cigarette or joint, the liquid form of PCP is typically smoked in a pipe with tobacco or cannabis.\n\nSales of pipe tobacco in Canada fell nearly 80% in a recent fifteen-year period to 27,319 kilograms in 2016, from 135,010 kilograms in 2001, according to federal data. By comparison, Canadian cigarette sales fell about 32% in the same period to 28,600,000,000 units.\n\nPipes have been fashioned from an assortment of materials including briar, clay, ceramic, corncob, glass, meerschaum, metal, gourd, stone, wood, bog oak and various combinations thereof, most notably, the classic English calabash pipe.\n\nThe size of a pipe, particularly the bowl, depends largely on what is intended to be smoked in it. Large western-style tobacco pipes are used for strong-tasting, harsh tobaccos, the smoke from which is usually not inhaled. Smaller pipes such as the midwakh or kiseru are used to inhale milder tobaccos such as \"dokha\" and \"kizami\" or other substances such as cannabis and opium.\n\nWater pipes bubble smoke through water to cool and wash the smoke. The two basic types are stationary hookahs, with one or more long flexible drawtubes, and portable bongs.\n\nSpoon pipes (glass pipes or glass bowl pipes) have become increasingly common with the rise of cannabis smoking. Spoon pipes are normally made of borosilicate glass to withstand repeated exposure to high temperatures. They consist of a bowl for packing material into, stem for inhaling, and a carbureter (carb) for controlling suction and airflow into the pipe. These pipes utilize a two step process. First, the user inhales while lighting the smoking material and holding down the carb, allowing smoke to fill the stem. Then, the user releases the carb while inhaling to allow air to enter the stem and smoke to be pulled into the user's mouth.\n\nThe overall health risks are 10% higher in pipe smokers than in non-smokers. However, pipe or cigar smokers who are former-cigarette smokers might retain a habit of smoke inhalation. In such cases, there is a 30% increase in the risk of heart disease and a nearly three times greater risk of developing COPD. In addition, there is a causal relationship between pipe smoking and mortality due to lung and other cancers, as well as periodontal problems, such as tooth and bone loss.\n\nHowever, all tobacco products deliver nicotine to the central nervous system, and there is a confirmed risk of dependence. Many forms of tobacco use are associated with a significantly increased risk of morbidity and premature mortality due to tobacco-related diseases.\n\nThe customs, vocabulary and etiquette that surround pipe smoking culture vary across the world and depend both on the people who are smoking and the substance being smoked.\n\nFor example, in many places in Europe and North America, tobacco pipe smoking has sometimes been seen as genteel or dignified and has given rise to a variety of customized accessories and even apparel such as the smoking jacket, and the former Pipe Smoker of the Year award in the UK, as well as the term \"kapnismology\" (\"the study of smoke\").\n\nThe ceremonial smoking of tobacco or other herbs, as a form of prayer, is still practiced in a number of Native American religious traditions. In southwestern Minnesota, the Pipestone National Monument commemorates Native American pipe-smoking culture.\n\nCannabis culture has its own pipe smoking traditions which differ from tobacco pipe smoking. For example, unlike tobacco smokers, cannabis users frequently pass a single pipe among two or more partners.\n\nA number of real and fictional persons are strongly associated with the hobby of pipe smoking.\n\n\n\nMore examples can be found in the Pipe Smoker of the Year list.\n\n\n"}

With a long history of criminal convictions, Abbott's writing on his life and experiences was lauded by a number of high-profile literary critics, including author Norman Mailer. Due in part to lobbying by Mailer and others on Abbott's behalf, Abbot was released from prison in 1981 where he was serving sentences for forgery, manslaughter and bank robbery. Abbott's memoir \"In the Belly of the Beast\" was published to positive reviews shortly after his release. Six weeks after being paroled from prison, Abbott stabbed and killed a waiter in a New York City cafe. Abbott was convicted and sent back to prison, where he committed suicide in 2002.\n\nAbbott described his life as being a \"state raised convict\", spending much of his life since age 12 in confinement in state facilities, including solitary confinement. He wrote that because of confinement with other violent offenders from whom he could not escape, he developed a subjective perspective that every encounter was potentially threatening.\n\nAbbott was born on January 21, 1944, at Camp Skeel in Oscoda, Michigan, to an Irish-American soldier and a Chinese-American prostitute. In his book, \"In the Belly of the Beast\" (1981), he said he had been in and out of foster care from the moment of his birth until the age of nine, at which point he started \"serving long stints in juvenile detention quarters\". As a child, Abbott was in trouble with teachers and later with the law, and by the age of 16 was sent to a long-term reform institution, the Utah State Industrial School. According to Abbott, his mistreatment by the school guards left him scarred for life. He also became a chronic bedwetter.\n\nIn 1965, aged 21, Abbott was serving a sentence for forgery in a Utah prison when he stabbed another inmate to death. He was given a sentence of three to 23 years for this offense, and in 1971 his sentence was increased by 19 years after he escaped and committed a bank robbery in Colorado. Behind bars, he was rebellious and spent much time in solitary confinement.\n\nIn 1977, Abbott read that author Norman Mailer was writing about convicted killer Gary Gilmore. Abbott wrote to Mailer, alleging that Gilmore was largely embellishing his experiences, and offered to write about his time behind bars in order to provide a more factual depiction of life in prison. Mailer agreed and helped to publish \"In the Belly of the Beast,\" a book on life in the prison system consisting of Abbott's letters to Mailer.\n\nMailer supported Abbott's attempts to gain parole. Abbott was released on parole in June 1981, despite the misgivings of prison officials, one of whom questioned Abbott's mental state and whether he was rehabilitated, saying, \"I thought ... that Mr. Abbott was a dangerous individual ... I didn't see a changed man. His attitude, his demeanor indicated psychosis.\" After leaving prison, Abbott went to a halfway house in New York City and made the acquaintance of some of Mailer's literary friends.\n\nAt around 5 a.m. on July 18, 1981, six weeks after being paroled from prison, Abbott and two women, Veronique de St. Andre and Susan Roxas, went to a small cafe called the Binibon, located at 79 Second Avenue in Manhattan. Richard Adan, a 22-year-old actor and playwright, was there working as a waiter in his father-in-law's restaurant. Abbott got up from his table and asked Adan to direct him to the toilet. Adan explained that the toilet could be reached only through the kitchen, and because the restaurant did not have accident insurance for customers, only employees could use the bathroom. Abbott argued with him. Adan led him outside to an alley to urinate, where Abbott stabbed Adan to death. The very next day, unaware of Abbott's crime, the \"New York Times\" ran Anatole Broyard's review of \"In the Belly of the Beast.\"\n\nAfter some time on the run, Abbott was recognized by a business owner and held until the police arrived to arrest him in Morgan City, Louisiana, while he was working in an oilfield. He was charged with Adan's murder and represented by high-profile defense attorney Ivan Fisher. At his trial in January 1982, Abbott gained the support of such celebrities as writer Jerzy Kosinski and actress Susan Sarandon. He was convicted of manslaughter but acquitted on murder, and sentenced to 15 years to life.\n\nApart from the advance fee of $12,500, Abbott did not receive any revenue from \"In the Belly of the Beast.\" Adan's widow successfully sued Abbott for $7.5 million in damages, which meant she would receive all the money from the book's sales.\n\nMailer was criticized for his role in getting Abbott released and was accused of being so blinded by Abbott's evident writing talent that he did not take into account the man's violent nature. In a 1992 interview in \"The Buffalo News,\" Mailer said that his involvement with Abbott was \"another episode in my life in which I can find nothing to cheer about or nothing to take pride in.\" Kosinski admitted that their advocacy of Abbott was, in essence, \"a fraud\".\n\nAbbott's second book, \"My Return\" (1987), was not as popular as \"In the Belly of the Beast.\"\n\nIn 2001, Abbott appeared before the parole board. His application was denied because of his failure to express remorse, his lengthy criminal record, and disciplinary problems in prison. Abbott's distrust of the prison system and his refusal to express remorse for many of his actions stemmed from his belief that much of what he did was in response to a dehumanizing system.\n\nOn February 10, 2002, Jack Abbott hanged himself in his prison cell using a makeshift noose constructed from his bedsheets and shoelaces. He left a suicide note, the contents of which have not been made public.\n\nAbbott claimed that his incarceration from the ages of 12 to 18 was the result of \"not adjusting well to foster homes\", and his indeterminate sentence of up to five years for \"issuing a check for insufficient funds\" when he was 18 was another example of a system that criminalizes and harshly punishes those it deems unfit for society.\n\nIn both his books, Abbott argues that society must reckon with its treatment of prisoners and that the prison system is fundamentally flawed, in that it treats prisoners like sub-human creatures. In \"In the Belly of the Beast\" he describes the helplessness that he says prisoners feel while at the mercy of a prison system that is seemingly never held accountable for its actions. He also hints at the subtle yet devastating effect prisons have on the whole of society. Abbott says:\n\nWe have no legal rights \"as prisoners\", only as citizens. The only 'rights' we have are those left to their 'discretion'. So we assert our rights the only way we can. It is a compromise, and in the end I greatly fear we as prisoners will lose—but the loss will be society's loss. We are only a few steps removed from society. After us, comes you.\n\nPsychiatrist Robert D. Hare described Abbott as displaying the lack of conscience and empathy typical of psychopaths. When asked in a segment for the television news program \"A Current Affair (American TV program)\" if he felt remorse for stabbing Adan, Abbott replied: \"Remorse implies you did something wrong...\"If\" I'm the one who stabbed him, it was an accident.\" Abbott also repeatedly insulted Adan's wife in court, claimed his victim had \"no future as an actor\" and despite his claims he was \"railroaded\" also asserted that \"There was no pain, it was a clean wound.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He had his first speaking role in the BBC's \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\" (1964). Smith persuaded the serial's director, Richard Martin, to expand the role so that his character, Wells, appeared in three of the serial's six episodes instead of only one or two as originally scripted.

The film's title refers to the ancient Chinese text of the same name by war strategist Sun Tzu. The film was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, \"\" and \"\". The latter did not feature Snipes.\n\nNeil Shaw (Snipes) is an operative for the United Nations's covert SAD, using espionage and quasi-ethical tactics to secure peace and cooperation. In Hong Kong, Shaw infiltrates a Chinese New Year party held by Chinese business mogul David Chan (Tagawa) and covertly hacks an office laptop of a North Korean Defense Minister, and blackmails him with the misappropriation of U.N. aid money, in exchange for continuing negotiations with South Korea. Shortly after being discovered, Shaw fights his way out of the party, and suffers a gunshot wound to his shoulder during extraction. \n\nSix months later, a shipping container full of dead Vietnamese refugees from Hong Kong turns up on the New York docks on the week as China's trade agreement with the U.S. Shaw's boss, Eleanor Hooks (Archer) suspects Chinese ambassador Wu's (Hong) connection with the Chinese Triad, and assigns Shaw to plant a bug on Wu during a banquet held by Chan. During the trade agreement banquet, Wu is gunned down, Chan is shot in the arm, and Shaw pursues a masked gunman. During the pursuit, Shaw's teammate Robert Bly (Biehn) corners the gunman, but perishes, and Shaw is arrested by the NYPD. In the middle of a prison transfer, FBI agent Frank Capella's (Chaykin) van is disabled by a roadside bomb, and an unconscious Shaw is captured by Triad members to be framed of the murder and disposed of. Shaw regains consciousness and frees himself from captivity, only to find his last remaining team member, Jenna Novak (Liliana Komorowska) murdered by a Chinese hitman. Shaw kills the hitman, recovers the audio file, and secures weapons and equipment from Novak's hidden armory. Shaw seeks out Julia Fang's (Matiko) help after reading a news article stating Shaw's innocence. Shaw manages to save Fang from an ambush by a Chinese hitwoman at a hospital. \n\nWith Fang's aid, Shaw finds a Triad-owned bakery serving as a front for a Gentleman's club, setting up an unlikely alliance with Capella, as well as retrieving video footage of Chan's role in derailing the trade agreement. Fang delivers the evidence to Hooks while Shaw confronts Chan at the same hotel serving as the banquet. Chan is shot dead by a masked gunman while being interrogated by Shaw. The pursuit ends when Shaw finds a scanner that is tuned to a tracking device embedded in Shaw's gunshot wound before being ambushed by Bly. Bly reveals himself as the assassin at the banquet, and also engineered the tracking device implant from an earlier basketball game injury. Hooks reviews the evidence, and reveals that she and Chan were the masterminds behind the conspiracy. A disgusted Fang tries to leave, but attempts to hide from Bly only to be locked in a bathroom.\n\nShaw eventually figures out Hooks's role behind the conspiracy and approaches Capella with his findings. Shaw uses Capella's business card to surgically remove his tracking device, and gives the Triads a business proposition. Shaw breaks into the U.N. building, and enters into a shootout and hand-to-hand fight with Bly, where the latter dies after falling on a glass shard from a broken glass pane. The following day, Shaw calls Hooks in her limousine and lectures her on a lesson in karma, revealing that Shaw's business proposition to the Triads was to assassinate Hooks for her betrayal. Shaw later has his death faked before reuniting with Fang in France, but is monitored by an unknown spy.\n\n\nJet Li was originally cast for the part eventually played by Wesley Snipes.\n\nTV reporter Erin Selby appears as a reporter.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 16% of 80 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10. The site's consensus says: \"Excessively noisy and overly reliant on genre clichés, \"The Art of War\" wastes its star's charisma on a ridiculous, convoluted plot and poorly edited action sequences.\" Metacritic rated it 30/100 based on 23 reviews. Emanuel Levy of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Despite some effectively rousing set pieces, particularly in the long corridors of the U.N. building, \"The Art of War\" is ultimately much less than the sum of its parts.\" Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called it \"ludicrous, impenetrable and headache-inducing\".\n\nThe film opened at #2 behind \"Bring It On\", earning $10,410,993 in its opening weekend in the United States. \"The Art of War\" went on to gross $40.4 million worldwide, failing to bring back its $60 million budget.\n\nWesley Snipes reprised his role as Neil Shaw in a straight-to-DVD sequel released in August 2008. Athena Karkanis and Lochlyn Munro also star in the movie. In the sequel, Agent Neil Shaw is called out of retirement as a Hollywood film consultant by the murder of his long-time martial arts mentor, \"Broodmother\".\n\nThe third and final in the series stars Anthony \"Treach\" Criss, Sung Hi Lee, Warren Derosa and David Basila, but neither Snipes nor any of his co-stars from the first two films.\n\n"}

The seat bucked the national results in 2005, 2017 and 2019 leaning to right and left respectively being in other results a bellwether, its winner belonging to the winning party nationally since 1979.\n\nCroydon Central covers a wedge of the London Borough of Croydon to the east of central Croydon and is much more marginal than the other selected two parliamentary divisions constrained to the borough itself; Croydon South (which is safely Conservative) and Croydon North (which is safely Labour).\n\nThe northern parts are characterised by terraced houses and urban areas, with small council estates. Labour gains much support from in particular Addiscombe, Fieldway, Woodside and Ashburton. The southern area, largely Conservative, consists of suburban semi-detached houses, populated by commuters, surrounded by golf courses and parkland. The wards of Shirley, Heathfield and Fairfield give large Conservative votes.\n\nIn the south-east corner is a large former council estate, New Addington; home to more than 10,000 people. The estate is largely white and has comprised the whole or vast bulk of one or two wards of the United Kingdom in its history.\n\nThe New Addington wards saw one of the highest turnouts of British National Party supporters during the 2002 and 2006 council elections, which the BNP described as their \"heyday decade,\" however it never elected a local councillor from the party – its slate of councillors has been consistently Labour. Except on one occasion in 2010, where a Conservative councillor was elected for the first time since 1968. Historically, Labour's strength in the area had been on the council estates, particularly New Addington, but in 2014, Labour support was reduced by UKIP, gauging 24% of the overall vote.\n\nThe two major-stop railway stations on the national network, most office buildings, businesses and shopping centres of Croydon are in the seat. A wide range of flats forms a major part of the housing sector unlike neighbouring seats, from upmarket expensively-built apartments with dedicated gym and restaurant facilities to \nex-local authority brutalist architecture tower blocks, most of which had been replaced by the 2010s decade.\n\nThe constituency that preceded Croydon Central, Croydon South (1918-1950) and (1955-1974) had the modern borough area's two periods of brief Labour Party parliamentary representation — David Rees-Williams held the forerunner from the 1945 Labour landslide until unfavourable boundary changes in 1950. David Winnick was MP 1966-1970.. Otherwise, the area at parliamentary level has elected, since 1918, Conservative MPs.\n\nIn 1997, Croydon's seats were reduced from four to three and the displaced Conservative members had to face one another for the right to stand in the new Croydon Central seat (Croydon North by then a Labour-held seat). The MP for Croydon North East, David Congdon was chosen over Sir Paul Beresford, the MP for the former Croydon Central seat. However, three years after Labour had taken control of Croydon Council, Labour's Geraint Davies saw off Congdon with a majority of 4,000 votes. He retained the seat with a similar majority in 2001, but lost by just 75 votes to Conservative Andrew Pelling in 2005, with the Liberal Democrats and Green Party gaining a local record of 7,000 votes between them.\n\nThe 2015 general election result, gave the seat the third-most marginal majority of the Conservative Party's 331 seats by percentage of majority. In 2017, Labour's Sarah Jones gained the seat with a majority of 5,652 votes, the largest in the seat for any party since 1992. \nCroydon Central is one of five constituencies, the others being Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West, Peterborough and Reading East; which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done so since 2001.\n\nCroydon Central covers the central and eastern parts of the London Borough of Croydon, one of the Borough's three seats. It is bordered by Croydon North and Croydon South, as well as Beckenham to the east.\n\nThe seat was redrawn in the 1997 redistribution, taking in territory from most of the pre-1997 Croydon Central constituency (losing Waddon ward to the redrawn Croydon South) and part of the abolished Croydon North East constituency. It covers an area that was Croydon South constituency until 1974 when part of Surrey East was incorporated into a new Croydon South constituency, following the creation of the London Borough of Croydon in 1965.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1826593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826593", "title": "Dead Cities", "text": "Dead Cities\n\nThe Dead Cities () or Forgotten Cities () are a group of 700 abandoned settlements in northwest Syria between Aleppo and Idlib. Around 40 villages grouped in eight archaeological parks situated in north-western Syria provide an insight into rural life in Late Antiquity and during the Byzantine period. Most of the villages, which date from the 1st to 7th centuries, were abandoned between the 8th and 10th centuries. The settlements feature the well-preserved architectural remains of dwellings, pagan temples, churches, cisterns, bathhouses etc. Important dead cities include the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, Serjilla and al Bara.\n\nThe Dead Cities are situated in an elevated area of limestone known as Limestone Massif. These ancient settlements cover an area wide and some long. The Massif includes three groups of highlands: the first is the northern group of Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd; the second middle group is the group of Harim Mountains; the third southern group is the group of Zawiya Mountain.\n\nChris Wickham, in the authoritative survey of the post-Roman world, \"Framing the Early Middle Ages\" (2006) argues that these were settlements of prosperous peasants which have few or no specifically urban features. The impressive remains of domestic architecture are the result of the prosperity of peasants who benefited from a strong international trade in olive oil at the end of Antiquity.\n\nAnother argument is that these were prosperous cities that flourished because they were located along major trade routes in the Byzantine Empire, and not merely prosperous peasant settlements. After conquest by the Arabs, the trade routes changed, and as a result these towns lost the majority of the business which fostered their economies. On this view, settlers eventually abandoned their towns and headed for other cities that were flourishing under the Arabs and the Umayyads as increasing urbanisation took its toll.\n\nThe ancient villages of the Dead Cities illustrate the transition from the ancient pagan world of the Roman Empire to Byzantine Christianity.\n\nThe Dead Cites were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, under the name of \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\".\n\nBefore the Syrian Civil War most sites had become easily accessible, the majority of the dead cities were well-preserved and tourists could access the sites quite freely, though some of the Dead Cities are quite difficult to reach without a guide (there is a guidebook by Abdallah Hadjar with a detailed map that is useful for finding the lesser known sites; \"The Church of St Simeon Stylites and Other Archaeological Sites in the Mountains of Simeon and Halaqa\").\n\nDead cities and archeological sites in Limestone Massif include Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, Serjilla, Bara, Basufan, Barisha, Qalb Loze, Barad, Cyrrhus, Turmanin, Banabil, Kafr Aruq, Kafr Dariyan, Babuline, Hazarin, Jarada, Maghara, Shinan, Farkya, Ein Laruz, Ebla, Deir Sunbul, Al-Dana, Sarmada and Al-Dana.\n\n"}

Mailer supported Abbott's successful bid for parole in 1981, the year that \"In the Belly of the Beast\" was published.\n\nThe book was very successful, and on July 19, 1981, the \"New York Times\" published a mixed to positive review. However, the day before, Abbott had killed waiter Richard Adan during a dispute at a restaurant called Binibon on 2nd Avenue in the East Village of New York City. Abbott was eventually arrested, convicted of manslaughter, and returned to prison for the rest of his life until his suicide in 2002. \n\nAdan's widow sued Abbott, winning the multi-million dollar royalty payments for \"Belly\"; Abbott received only a $12,500 publishing advance.\n\nIn 1983–1985, William Petersen starred in several stage performances based on the book, for which he received a Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn 2004, the New York City theatre company 29th Street Rep ran a play based on the book, named \"In the Belly of the Beast Revisited\".\n\nThe book has no organizing principle of chronology, nor is it constructed along conventional tale-telling lines. Instead, it has an Introduction by Mailer, a Foreword, and twelve chapters. Each chapter bears a title that labels the chapter's content; the text consists of excerpts on the subject, extracted from Abbott's letters to Mailer. The chapters do not cleave cleanly into discrete matter; there is a lot of overlap in subject matter. Erroll McDonald, a Random House editor, was the organizer.\n\nCritic Anatole Broyard, who reviewed the book in 1981, declared that the best segments of the book were Abbott's letters to Norman Mailer, demonstrating eloquence and an evident, if raw, talent for writing. However, Broyard also wrote that Abbott was less persuading when the topic turned to \"rants about justice, politics and philosophy\". \n\nPsychologist Robert D. Hare has suggested that Abbott was a probable psychopath, given his history of callousness, manipulative behavior, and lack of conscience; Hare's \"Without Conscience\" (1993) quotes Abbott in displaying these traits.\n\nThe Australian movie \"Ghosts… of the Civil Dead\", directed by John Hillcoat, was largely influenced by \"In Belly of the Beast\". Hillcoat had corresponded with Abbott after his return to incarceration. One of the movie's co-authors, Nick Cave, was also inspired when writing the song \"Jack's Shadow\".\n"}
{"id": "1826626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826626", "title": "Stars Hollow", "text": "Stars Hollow\n\nStars Hollow is a fictional town in Connecticut featured on the television show \"Gilmore Girls\". It is a close-knit community with many quirky characteristics, located roughly thirty minutes from Hartford.\n\nIn the center of the town is a town square, complete with a gazebo and a statue of Casimir Pulaski.\nAccording to Luke, Stars Hollow has \"twelve stores... devoted entirely to peddling porcelain unicorns.\"\n\nOther establishments mentioned: Nancy's Cottage of Calico, a post office, Stars Hollow Bank, travel agency, vintage clothing store, law firm, gas station, a knitting store that Mrs. Kim frequents, a stationery store, a real estate office, a pharmacy, and a shoe store. The town is also mentioned to have fast food chain restaurants such as Burger King, McDonald's, and Taco Bell to name a few as well as a Walmart on the outskirts of town near the Highway.\n\nStars Hollow was founded in 1779 with conflicting legends regarding how it got its name. Although some within the town doubt the theory, the traditionally accepted legend involves two star-crossed lovers who seemed destined never to be together, until separate cosmological phenomena involving stars led them to each other at the spot where the town now exists. This is celebrated annually at the Firelight Festival, shown in 1st season episode \"Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers\" and 4th season episode \"Nag Hammadi is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels.\"\n\nAnother story of Stars Hollow's founding was presented in Season 5, episode 18, \"To Die and Let Diorama.\" A talking display built in the new Stars Hollow Museum explained that a Puritan family first discovered the area while looking for a place to settle. They named it as such because of \"the stars, so bright; this forest, so hollow!\"\n\nThere was also a \"battle\" fought in Stars Hollow where 12 men stood and waited for the Redcoats who never came. This battle is re-enacted annually, shown in first season episode \"Love and War and Snow\" and in 5th season episode \"Women of Questionable Morals.\" This second occurrence marked the beginning of the addition of the town prostitute, who slept with the British general to delay the troops.\n\nOn the town square's gazebo is the town's Liberty Bell sign, which reads: \nAccording to the Stars Hollow Historical Society, Third Street is among the town's worst historical landmarks to take your children. In the 18th century, it was known as \"Sores and Boils Alley,\" where sick and suffering people throughout the region came to have sores and boils lanced. A small leper colony is said to have existed there as well. On modern-day Third Street, one will find the newly restored Dragonfly Inn.\n\nThroughout its history, Third Street has also held various other names, aside from the aforementioned \"Sores and Boils Alley,\" including \"Constabulary Road,\" \"Crusty Bulge,\" and a Nipmuc Indian name, \"Chargogagogmanchogagogcharbunagunggamog.\" The Nipmuc Indian name is said to mean, \"You fish on your side of the lake, I'll fish on my side and no one will fish in the middle.\" According to Kirk, it could also mean \"Buffalo.\" This place name is actually based on the local name for a lake in Webster, Massachusetts, which is more formally known as Webster Lake.\n\nThe town square is located on the Warner Bros. studio back lot. It is just around the corner from the exterior set for the hospital from \"ER\".\n\nThe town square and gazebo can be seen during the robbery scene of the \"Seinfeld\" series finale in 1998.\n\nMany of the sets for Stars Hollow were also used in \"The Music Man\", \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", and \"The Waltons\". The Dragonfly Inn was the Waltons' home. The town's high school was the Hazzard County Courthouse.\n\nThe set was subsequently used by Warner Bros. for \"Supernatural\", \"\", \"Pushing Daisies\", \"Eastwick\", and was also the setting for the town square in 2007's \"Norbit\".\n\nIt was also used for the drama \"Ghost Whisperer\" after a fire at the Universal Studios backlot (Courthouse Square) in June 2008.\n\nIt was also Walter and Gary's hometown Smalltown in the 2011 movie \"The Muppets\"\n\nUnionville, Ontario's Main Street was used as a stand-in for Stars Hollow in the show's pilot which became the first episode.\n\nStarting in 2010, the set was used for the ABC Family show \"Pretty Little Liars\". Luke's Diner was used as Rosewood Cafe. \"Hart of Dixie\"'s fictional Bluebell also used the square. The Stars Hollow High School was used as Rosewood High School.\nIt was also used in the 2012 TV series \"Go On\" season 1 episode 6 'Big League Chew' in a dream-like sequence of the character Ryan King.\n\nStars Hollow was inspired by and is loosely based on the actual villages of Washington Depot, Connecticut, West Hartford, Connecticut, and the town of New Milford, Connecticut while the shows writer spent 3 weeks at the Mayflower Grace in Washington, Connecticut. Sherman-Palladino later said, \"Now, I've never been there in winter, when you're snowed in and you can't go anywhere, and you and your husband want to kill each other because you can't go to a movie. But at the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie. . . . There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought – that's something that I would really love to put out there.\"\n\nIn the liner notes for the show's soundtrack, \"Music from Gilmore Girls\", a postcard sent by Lane from South Korea is pictured, and is addressed to Rory's home address of 37 Maple Street in Stars Hollow. The town's ZIP code is shown as 06492, the same as Wallingford. It does not have a Maple Street, however they do have a Maple Avenue.\n\nWashington Depot, and Kent, the villages Amy Sherman-Palladino mentioned as inspiring Stars Hollow, also use a town meeting-style government. Washington Depot was founded in 1779, while Kent was founded in 1739. The homes and buildings in these villages all match the style of that in Stars Hollow and the archetype New England town. In all, plenty of small Connecticut towns have village greens, gazebos or small quaint shops and give a feel much like Stars Hollow to a visitor.\n\nRory began attending Chilton at the start of the series. Chilton is a prep school that seems to be located in Hartford (in season 2, episode 5 Lane mentions a record store called Record Breaker, Inc. on 2453 Berlin Turnpike, \"ten minutes from your school\", which narrows it down to Newington, CT). It is based on Wallingford's Choate Rosemary Hall. Stars Hollow also is on a Connecticut Transit route, as Rory commutes to and from the school using a bus from Stars Hollow's town square. However, there is no Connecticut Transit route that would take Rory directly to Hartford in a reasonable time via bus.\n\nGreg Morago of \"the Hartford Courant\" writes, \"Unlike the Hartford depicted on \"Judging Amy\", the Stars Hollow of \"The Gilmore Girls\" rings true. The town's antiques shops, small businesses, schools, government and infrastructure look the part. But where Sherman-Palladino has truly excelled, despite her \"Clueless\" origins, is in her drawing of colorful Connecticut characters. The populace of Stars Hollow, from the town busybody to the town troubadour, is familiar to any Nutmegger who ever attended a town meeting.\"\n\nDuring Season 1 Episode 2, when Rory is on her way to her first day at school they drive past the Gelston House, (located in East Haddam, CT) a restaurant next to the Goodspeed Opera House and East Haddam Swing Bridge.\n\nIn Season 6, Richard and Emily offer to buy Luke and Lorelai a house in Beacon Falls, just over the border from Stars Hollow and a short drive to Luke's Diner and the Dragonfly Inn. In the same season, Luke's young daughter April regularly rides her bicycle to Luke's Diner from Woodbridge. During Season 7 when Lorelei's Jeep breaks down they mention being within feasible walking distance of Naugatuck; later on, Luke takes Lorelai car shopping to a dealer that is noted to be located in Watertown. Taylor Doose mentions that Woodbridge is on the other side of the railroad tracks during the Pickle Spill in Season 7 and frequently speaks of Woodbridge as a \"sister\" town.

{"id": "1826694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826694", "title": "Cory Arcangel", "text": "Cory Arcangel\n\nCory Arcangel (born May 25, 1978) is a Brooklyn, New York post-conceptual artist who makes work in many different media, including drawing, music, video, performance art, and video game modifications, for which he is perhaps best known.\n\nArcangel often uses the artistic strategy of appropriation, creatively reusing existing materials such as dancing stands, Photoshop gradients and YouTube videos to create new works of art. His work explores the relationship between digital technology and pop culture. He is a recipient of a 2006 Creative Capital Emerging Fields Award \n\nArcangel grew up in Buffalo, New York and attended the Nichols School, where he was a star lacrosse goalie. He was exposed to experimental video artists such as Nam June Paik through the Squeaky Wheel Buffalo Media Arts Center. He was very interested in guitar, practicing eight hours a day by the time he turned seventeen. He studied classical guitar at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, but later switched to major in the technology of music, graduating in 2000. At Oberlin, Arcangel met Jacob Ciocci and Paul B. Davis. Arcangel and Davis formed the Beige Programming Ensemble in 2000, and released a record of 8-bit music entitled \"The 8-Bit Construction Set\" by the age of 19. The 8-bit Construction Set was a record that was made on one side by the Commodore 64 and the other side by the Atari 800. A total of 4 people (Joe Boyd, Jo Bond, Paul B. Davis, and Cory Arcangel) were working on the project and took about 2 years to complete. \n\nArcangel credits Pauline Oliveros, with whom he took a composition class, for his \"fascination with finding artistic inspiration in unlikely machines\". He describes a piece in which she connected sine wave oscillators to loudspeakers and output the exact audio frequency as the resonance of the concert hall, creating an increasingly louder sound. This, he says, was what made it \"click\" for him. Arcangel counts many among his influences, including Steve Reich, Tiger Woods, and \"Weekend at Bernie's\".\n\nArcangel's best known works are his Nintendo game cartridge hacks and reworkings of obsolete computer systems of the 1970s and 80s. One example is \"Super Mario Clouds\" (2002), a modified version of the video game \"Super Mario Bros.\" for Nintendo's NES game console in which all of the game's graphics have been removed, leaving a blue background with white clouds scrolling slowly from right to left.\n\"I Shot Andy Warhol\" (2002) is a modified version of the video game \"Hogans Alley\". It is similar to the original NES game, except that the gangsters from the original have been replaced by Andy Warhol, and the \"innocents\" have been replaced by the Pope, Flavor Flav, and Colonel Sanders. Both the graphics and the programs were modified, a complete binary hack, but the game is downloadable for at home play.\n\n\"Totally Fucked\" (2003) was created by modifying \"Super Mario Bros.\". Arcangel created a world where Mario starts on a single block-cube centered in blue nothingness.\n\n\"Pizza Party\" (2004) was a free, functional software package that could be used to order Domino's Pizza through a command-line interface. The program allowed users to order pizza by typing in commands such as pizza_party -pmx 2 medium regular, which - according to the artist - would order two medium crust pizzas with pepperoni, mushrooms and extra cheese. The piece was commissioned by Eyebeam and implemented by Mike Frumin.\n\nIn this 2004 single-channel video, Arcangel points the camera at a television screen that is playing a tape of the concert. Each time Paul Simon appears in the frame, Arcangel places his hand over Simon's image. The work is one of several videos, performances and lectures by Arcangel based on Simon and Garfunkel's live concerts.\n\n\"Tetris Screwed\" (2004) is based upon \"Tetris\"; modified to play at a very slow speed, where it takes about 8 hours for the blocks to fall in one complete game. The blocks can still be moved from left to right, but takes minutes for the blocks to fall pixel by pixel. \"Tetris Screwed\" is a binary hack, where the constant delay loop was written by hand in 6502 binary.\n\nIn collaboration with the art collective Paper Rad, and extended off of Arcangel's \"Totally Fucked\" (2003), \"Super Mario Movie\" (2005) is another modified NES \"Super Mario Bros.\" cartridge, programmed to be a 15-minute video and is available for download for an NES emulator. The video consists of a series of original 8-bit tracks, original texts and \"dialogue\" boxes, and a complete rework of the background images and coding via 6502 binary.\n\n\"Punk Rock 101\" (2006) is an example of Arcangel's work with the web as an artistic medium. For this piece, he re-published Kurt Cobain's alleged suicide letter alongside a series of Google Ads. The ads are tailored to the content of any given page, and the piece juxtaposed Cobain's angst with ads selling social anxiety treatment and motivational speaking. Art critic Paddy Johnson wrote of the work, \"This is quite possibly the most brilliant subversion of the medium I have seen.\"\n\nIn 2007, Film and Video Umbrella commissioned Arcangel to produce a new work, \"a couple of thousand short films about Glenn Gould\", using tiny fragments of video, each containing a single note produced by various instruments (and some performing pets) to create an arrangement of Bach's \"Variation no. 1\" (from the Goldberg Variations). To do this, he had to create his own video-editing software.\n\nArcangel's 2007 LP is an intervention into Bruce Springsteen's 1975 album \"Born to Run\". While the album's title track includes a glockenspiel part, many of the songs on the album do not. Arcangel created a glockenspiel part for each of these songs, releasing them on this vinyl record, which can be played in sync with Springsteen's original to add a 'missing' part to the original album. In addition to the LP, Arcangel has also performed the piece live.\n\nArcangel's \"Photoshop CS\" series are large c-print gradient digital paintings created solely in the eponymous popular image editing program. They appear to be a pop art version of abstract expressionism or color field painting.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 Arcangel exhibited a series of 1920X1080 H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 looped digital file from lossless Quicktime Animation master.\nThe pieces are displayed on 70\" flat screens using a media player. Pop culture images have had the outdated Java applet \"lake\" applied, creating the series of film images.\n\nArcangel's series of \"Photoshop Gradient Demonstrations\" are large, colorful prints produced using the gradient tool built into the image-processing software Photoshop. The title of each of these works describes the process by which it was made. For example, one 2008 work is titled \"Photoshop CS: 110 by 72 inches, 300 DPI, RGB, square pixels, default gradient \"Spectrum\", mousedown y=1098 x=1749.9, mouse up y=0 x=4160\". With these instructions, any Photoshop user can reproduce Arcangel's abstract images on their own computer.\n\nArcangel created \"Various Self Playing Bowling Games (aka Beat the Champ)\" (2011) by hacking various bowling video games (for game consoles from Atari 2600 to Nintendo GameCube) to throw gutter balls. Arcangel says, \"But throwing a gutter ball is just humiliating. That's what makes the piece so ridiculous, but also sad and even oppressive. The failure seems funny at first–then it flips.\" Art critic Charles Darwent from \"The Independent\" described the work as \"complex and funny and moving.\" Andrea K. Scott of \"The New Yorker\" compared the piece to Bruce Nauman's \"Stamping in the Studio\", where he stamped in an empty room for an hour, as \"a ritual of isolation and futility\".\n\nArcangel, with the help of specialists, assembled a collection of 839 trance LPs and a corresponding catalogue in Machine Readable Cataloging standard (2012). The vinyl was originally purchased from retired trance and underground dance music disk jockey Joshua Ryan and cataloged over 2011 and 2012 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn by the Cory Arcangel fine arts studio. A key point to remember considering this work is that these records were only ever intended to be used whilst DJing and not listened to in a stand-alone format. Because of this, the work preserves the music featured in it by making it so far removed from its original context and purpose.\n\nIn military parlance, the terms asymmetrical and symmetrical are employed to refer to political provocations and diplomatic démarches, escalation and tension, and power dynamics of the highest order. Not specific to war, these terms also refer more generally to a set of relations that define our connections to power. In their first collaboration, Arcangel and Olia Lialina present complex bodies of work that arose through their continuing conversation.\n\nArcangel's work has appeared in several museum exhibitions, including a solo exhibition at the Migros Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, and exhibitions in the Barbican Centre in London, England and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Illinois. His work has also been exhibited in many places in New York City, including the Museum of Modern Art's Color Chart, the Whitney Museum, and the New Museum. His work is included in public collections in locations such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, Miami Art Museum, Migros Museum, and Neue Nationalgalerie. Arcangel is represented by Team Gallery in New York, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Paris and Salzburg, Lisson Gallery in London, and Galerie Guy Bartschi in Geneva.\n\nAt 33, Arcangel was the youngest artist ever to receive an entire floor for new work with \"Pro Tools\", his 2011 solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Other notable solo shows since have been \"Power Points\" (2013) and \"Masters\" (2012). Many of his shows include a variety of old and new work from Arcangel.\n\nArcangel was an Eyebeam resident from 2002 to 2006.\n\nArcangel is married to Hanne Mugaas, a Norwegian curator. Arcangel was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and his treatments gave him both concentration and memory issues, completely wiping out his short-term memory for a period of time. It also temporarily affected his work, leading him to create works that he described as \"hyper-structuralist\" or void of \"real content\". The cancer returned in 2009, and his lymph nodes were removed, freeing him of the disease.\n\n"}
{"id": "1826695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826695", "title": "Coolant", "text": "Coolant\n\nA coolant is a substance, typically liquid or gas, that is used to reduce or regulate the temperature of a system. An ideal coolant has high thermal capacity, low viscosity, is low-cost, non-toxic, chemically inert and neither causes nor promotes corrosion of the cooling system. Some applications also require the coolant to be an electrical insulator.\n\nWhile the term \"coolant\" is commonly used in automotive and HVAC applications, in industrial processing heat transfer fluid is one technical term more often used in high temperature as well as low temperature manufacturing applications. The term also covers cutting fluids. Industrial cutting fluid has broadly classified as water-soluble coolant and neat cutting fluid. Water-soluble coolant is oil in water emulsion. It has varying oil content from nil oil (synthetic coolant).\n\nThis coolant can either keep its phase and stay liquid or gaseous, or can undergo a phase transition, with the latent heat adding to the cooling efficiency. The latter, when used to achieve below-ambient temperature, is more commonly known as refrigerant.\n\nAir is a common form of a coolant. Air cooling uses either convective airflow (passive cooling), or a forced circulation using fans.\n\nHydrogen is used as a high-performance gaseous coolant. Its thermal conductivity is higher than all other gases, it has high specific heat capacity, low density and therefore low viscosity, which is an advantage for rotary machines susceptible to windage losses. Hydrogen-cooled turbogenerators are currently the most common electrical generators in large power plants.\n\nInert gases are used as coolants in gas-cooled nuclear reactors. Helium has a low tendency to absorb neutrons and become radioactive. Carbon dioxide is used in Magnox and AGR reactors.\n\nSulfur hexafluoride is used for cooling and insulating of some high-voltage power systems (circuit breakers, switches, some transformers, etc.).\n\nSteam can be used where high specific heat capacity is required in gaseous form and the corrosive properties of hot water are accounted for.\n\nSome coolants are used in both liquid and gas form in the same circuit, taking advantage of the high specific latent heat of boiling/condensing phase change, the enthalpy of vaporization, in addition to the fluid's non-phase-change heat capacity.\n\nRefrigerants are coolants used for reaching low temperatures by undergoing phase change between liquid and gas. Halomethanes were frequently used, most often R-12 and R-22, often with liquified propane or other haloalkanes like R-134a. Anhydrous ammonia is frequently used in large commercial systems, and sulfur dioxide was used in early mechanical refrigerators. Carbon dioxide (R-744) is used as a working fluid in climate control systems for cars, residential air conditioning, commercial refrigeration, and vending machines. Many otherwise excellent refrigerants are phased out for environmental reasons (the CFCs due to ozone layer effects, now many of their successors face restrictions due to global warming, e.g. the R134a).\n\nHeat pipes are a special application of refrigerants.\n\nWater is sometimes employed this way, e.g. in boiling water reactors. The phase change effect can be intentionally used, or can be detrimental.\n\nPhase-change materials use the other phase transition between solid and liquid.\n\nLiquid gases may fall here, or into refrigerants, as their temperature is often maintained by evaporation. Liquid nitrogen is the best known example encountered in laboratories. The phase change may not occur at the cooled interface, but on the surface of the liquid, to where the heat is transferred by convective or forced flow.\n\nWater is the most common coolant. Its high heat capacity and low cost makes it a suitable heat-transfer medium. It is usually used with additives, like corrosion inhibitors and antifreeze. Antifreeze, a solution of a suitable organic chemical (most often ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or propylene glycol) in water, is used when the water-based coolant has to withstand temperatures below 0 °C, or when its boiling point has to be raised. Betaine is a similar coolant, with the exception that it is made from pure plant juice, and is therefore not toxic or difficult to dispose of ecologically.\n\nPolyalkylene glycol (PAG) is used as high temperature, thermally stable heat transfer fluids exhibiting strong resistance to oxidation. Modern PAGs can also be non-toxic and non-hazardous.\n\nCutting fluid is a coolant that also serves as a lubricant for metal-shaping machine tools.\n\nOils are often used for applications where water is unsuitable. With higher boiling points than water, oils can be raised to considerably higher temperatures (above 100 degrees Celsius) without introducing high pressures within the container or loop system in question. Many oils have uses encompassing heat transfer, lubrication, pressure transfer (hydraulic fluids), sometimes even fuel, or several such functions at once.\n\nFuels are frequently used as coolants for engines. A cold fuel flows over some parts of the engine, absorbing its waste heat and being preheated before combustion. Kerosene and other jet fuels frequently serve in this role in aviation engines. Liquid hydrogen is used to cool nozzles of rocket engines.\n\nWaterless coolant is used as an alternative to conventional water and ethylene glycol coolants. With higher boiling points than water (around 370F), the cooling technology resists boil over. The liquid also prevents corrosion. \n\nFreons were frequently used for immersive cooling of e.g. electronics.\n\nLiquid fusible alloys can be used as coolants in applications where high temperature stability is required, e.g. some fast breeder nuclear reactors. Sodium (in sodium cooled fast reactors) or sodium-potassium alloy NaK are frequently used; in special cases lithium can be employed. Another liquid metal used as a coolant is lead, in e.g. lead cooled fast reactors, or a lead-bismuth alloy. Some early fast neutron reactors used mercury.\n\nFor certain applications the stems of automotive poppet valves may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer.\n\nFor very high temperature applications, e.g. molten salt reactors or very high temperature reactors, molten salts can be used as coolants. One of the possible combinations is the mix of sodium fluoride and sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaF-NaBF). Other choices are FLiBe and FLiNaK.\n\nLiquified gases are used as coolants for cryogenic applications, including cryo-electron microscopy, overclocking of computer processors, applications using superconductors, or extremely sensitive sensors and very low-noise amplifiers.\n\nCarbon Dioxide (chemical formula is CO) - is used as a coolant replacement for cutting fluids. CO can provide controlled cooling at the cutting interface such that the cutting tool and the workpiece are held at ambient temperatures. The use of CO greatly extends tool life, and on most materials allows the operation to run faster. This is considered a very environmentally friendly method, especially when compared to the use of petroleum oils as lubricants; parts remain clean and dry which often can eliminate secondary cleaning operations.\n\nLiquid nitrogen, which boils at about -196 °C (77K), is the most common and least expensive coolant in use. Liquid air is used to a lesser extent, due to its liquid oxygen content which makes it prone to cause fire or explosions when in contact with combustible materials (see oxyliquits).\n\nLower temperatures can be reached using liquified neon which boils at about -246 °C. The lowest temperatures, used for the most powerful superconducting magnets, are reached using liquid helium.\n\nLiquid hydrogen at -250 to -265 °C can also be used as a coolant. Liquid hydrogen is also used both as a fuel and as a coolant to cool nozzles and combustion chambers of rocket engines.\n\nA new class of coolants are nanofluids which consist of a carrier liquid, such as water, dispersed with tiny nano-scale particles known as nanoparticles. Purpose-designed nanoparticles of e.g. CuO, alumina, titanium dioxide, carbon nanotubes, silica, or metals (e.g. copper, or silver nanorods) dispersed into the carrier liquid enhance the heat transfer capabilities of the resulting coolant compared to the carrier liquid alone. The enhancement can be theoretically as high as 350%. The experiments however did not prove so high thermal conductivity improvements, but found significant increase of the critical heat flux of the coolants.\n\nSome significant improvements are achievable; e.g. silver nanorods of 55±12 nm diameter and 12.8 µm average length at 0.5 vol.% increased the thermal conductivity of water by 68%, and 0.5 vol.% of silver nanorods increased thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol based coolant by 98%. Alumina nanoparticles at 0.1% can increase the critical heat flux of water by as much as 70%; the particles form rough porous surface on the cooled object, which encourages formation of new bubbles, and their hydrophilic nature then helps pushing them away, hindering the formation of the steam layer.\nNanofluid with the concentration more than 5% acts like non-Newtonian fluids.\n\nIn some applications, solid materials are used as coolants. The materials require high energy to vaporize; this energy is then carried away by the vaporized gases. This approach is common in spaceflight, for ablative atmospheric reentry shields and for cooling of rocket engine nozzles. The same approach is also used for fire protection of structures, where ablative coating is applied.\n\nDry ice and water ice can be also used as coolants, when in direct contact with the structure being cooled. Sometimes an additional heat transfer fluid is used; water with ice and dry ice in acetone are two popular pairings.\n\nSublimation of water ice was used for cooling the space suit for Project Apollo.\n\n"}

It is led by Ken Lukyamuzi.\n\nThe Conservative Party serves as \"de facto\" successor to Kabaka Yekka, a Baganda political party and movement that had been loyal to the Buganda monarchy and operated directly after Uganda's independence. Kabaka Yekka and the Buganda kingdom were forcibly disbanded during the Mengo Crisis of 1966. The prime minister (Katikkiro) for Buganda, Jehoash Mayanja Nkangi, consequently fled abroad. As former member of Kabaka Yekka's youth wing, Nkangi organized the Conservative Party in exile; thus, 1966 is regarded as the party's traditional foundation date. However, the party only became truly active from 1979 or 1980 onwards.\n\nBy the time of its foundation, the CP generally followed similar principles as Kabaka Yekka. Overall, its political aims were not well defined; it only called for the restoration of Uganda's 1962 constitution and the decentralization of political power in the country. The party was considered monarchist, as one of its main objective was to protect Uganda's traditional rulers. Regardless, it did not emphasize its connection to Baganda royalists.\n\nThe CP was one of the four parties to register for the 1980 Ugandan general election, but remained a minor force. It lacked funding, had no paramilitary wing like other Ugandan parties, and possessed no firm party organization. In fact, many Baganda monarchists preferred to join the Democratic Party (DP), as they believed that the Conservative Party could not win the election. While campaigning in 1980, the party claimed that its supporters were harassed by the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and DP. In the next decades, the CP remained a marginal group, while Ugandan came under the control of a succession of authoritarian governments. Regardless, Nkangi became an influential figure and was appointed as minister by several Ugandan regimes. By the early 1990s, the CP increasingly voiced its support for Kabaka Yekka's traditional aims. In 1993, the long-held ambition by the monarchists to restore the Buganda kingdom was fulfilled. Nkangi played an important role in the restoration.\n\nThe CP was affected by factionalism during the early 2000s, with notable factions led by Nkangi, and Makindye West MP Nsubuga Nsambu respectively. Nkangi initially reconciled with the rest of the CP under secretary general Ken Lukyamuzi in July 2003, but was ousted from his position as president-general of the party in November of that year. Nsambu and Lukyamuzi claimed that Nkangi had become too close to the ruling government of Yoweri Museveni, and no longer followed the CP's ideology. Nsambu was consequently declared interim party president. Internal disputes continued until 2005, when Nkangi officially agreed to pass the leadership of the CP to Lukyamuzi.\n\nIn the general election of 23 February 2006, the party won 1 out of 289 elected seats.\n\nThe Conservative Party supported presidential candidate Kizza Besigye during the general election of 2016. CP president Lukyamuzi attended the foundation ceremony for the Alliance for National Transformation in 2019.\n\nThe Conservative Party is described as centre-right. The party places great importance in Ugandan traditions and customs, and is regarded as monarchist due to its support for the traditional rulers. It has proposed the decentralization and federalisation of Uganda, arguing that the country was formed as a union of different peoples. As these ideas have gradually become more popular in Uganda, other parties have adopted them as well, leaving the CP marginalized. The party has consequently begun to focus more on social justice, and presents itself as advocate for the rural poor, against special privileges, and against corruption. It also supports the sustainable use of Uganda's forests and bodies of water, and has campaigned for the protection of the environment.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826711", "title": "Lithuanian Wars of Independence", "text": "Lithuanian Wars of Independence\n\nThe Lithuanian Wars of Independence, also known as the Freedom Struggles (), refer to three wars Lithuania fought defending its independence at the end of World War I: with Bolshevik forces (December 1918 – August 1919), Bermontians (June 1919 – December 1919), and Poland (August 1920 – November 1920). The wars delayed international recognition of independent Lithuania and the formation of civil institutions.\n\nAfter the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. The Lithuanian National Revival emerged during the 19th century and the movement to establish an independent nation-state intensified during the early 20th century. During World War I, Lithuanian territory was occupied by Germany from 1915 until the war ended in November 1918.\n\nOn February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared the re-establishment of independence from all previous legal bonds with other states. The declaration asserted the right to self-determination, meaning the creation of a state within ethnic Lithuanian territories. The publication of the Act of Independence was initially suppressed by the German occupation forces, but on March 23, 1918, the Germans acknowledged the declaration; their plans had shifted to the establishment of a network of satellite countries (Mitteleuropa). However, Germany did not allow the Council to establish a Lithuanian military force, police force, or civic institutions. On November 11, 1918 Germany signed an armistice on the Western Front and officially lost the war and control over Lithuania. The first national government, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, was formed. Voldemaras issued a declaration that Lithuania did not need a military force, as it was not planning to engage in warfare, and that only a small militia was needed. This view was unrealistic, since military conflicts soon erupted.\n\nThe first legislative act creating an army was passed on November 23, 1918. Its development and organization moved slowly due to lack of funding, arms, ammunition, and experienced military commanders. On December 20 Antanas Smetona and Voldemaras went to Germany to request assistance. This arrived at the end of 1918, when Germany paid the Lithuanian government one hundred million marks in reparations; the organization of the new Lithuanian army proceeded under the auspices of the German army, which was withdrawing in stages. However, the departure of both leaders created a difficult domestic situation. The Council of Lithuania released Voldemaras' cabinet; Mykolas Sleževičius became Prime Minister of Lithuania and formed a Cabinet on 26 December 1918. Perceiving an imminent threat to the state, he issued a proclamation several days later. Directed at Lithuanian men, the proclamation invited volunteers to join a force to defend the country.\n\nLithuanian volunteers who agreed to join the military force were promised free land. Fulfilling its Armistice obligation to support Lithuanian independence, Germany initially tried to organize a volunteer force from units remaining in Lithuanian territory, but those attempts failed. Crimps were sent to Germany to recruit volunteers. A division of volunteers was soon formed, who were paid 5 marks per day plus 30 marks per month. The first units began arriving in Lithuania during January 1919, although some of them were sent away because they were in poor condition. By the end of January, 400 volunteers were stationed in Alytus, Jonava, Kėdainiai, and Kaunas. They formed the basis for the 46th Saxonian division, renamed in March to the Southern Lithuanian Saxonian Volunteer Brigade. The brigade consisted of the 18th, 19th, and 20th regiments. The last of these German troops would leave Lithuania during July 1919.\n\nAfter successful attempts at mustering a voluntary force to defend Lithuanian territories, mobilization was begun on March 5, 1919 to expand the Lithuanian armed forces. It applied to men born between 1897 and 1899. At the end of summer 1919, the Lithuanian army numbered about 8,000 men. During the battles that followed, 1,700 Lithuanian volunteers died, more than 2,600 were injured, and 800 were missing in action. Historian Alfonsas Eidintas cites the total deaths as 1,444.\n\nAs revolution broke out in Germany, the German government withdrew support for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which had ceded Lithuania independence from Soviet Russia on November 5, 1918. Meanwhile, the Soviet Russian government renounced the treaty on November 13. The Bolsheviks attempted to conquer Lithuania from the east as part of their global proletarian revolution. Elsewhere, the treaty of 1918 had also ceded independence to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in the Near East, and Belarus and Ukraine in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union attacked these nations as well. But whereas they did fall, Lithuania and Poland would not.\n\nOn December 8, 1918, a temporary revolutionary government in the capital city of Vilnius was formed, consisting solely of members of the Communist Party of Lithuania. Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas became its chairman. The following day a workers' soviet was formed and declared that it had taken control of Vilnius. However, Voldemaras' government and a Polish committee also declared their control of the city at the same time. The Germans finally abandoned Vilnius on December 31, 1918. On January 5, 1919 the Red Army took it and advanced further in the west. Local Polish paramilitary platoons led by general Władysław Wejtko fought the Red Army in Vilnius for five days; the Lithuanian government had left Vilnius along with the regular German Army. On January 1, 1919 local communists in the town of Šiauliai, about 200 kilometers west of Vilnius, rebelled and created a 1,000-man \"Samogitian Regiment\"; when the Red Army entered the town on January 15 Soviet power already existed there. On January 18 the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty and designated a demarcation line that barred Bolshevik forces from directly attacking Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city. The Red Army would need to attack through Alytus or Kėdainiai.\n\nGerman volunteers led by Rüdiger von der Goltz arrived in Lithuania, took up positions along the Hrodna–Kaišiadorys–Kaunas line, and helped the Lithuanian forces, commanded by Jonas Variakojis, to stop the Red Army advance near Kėdainiai. On February 8, during a reconnaissance mission, the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the wars, Povilas Lukšys, was killed near Taučiūnai. On February 10 the joint forces captured Šėta and forced the Red Army to retreat. The success of this operation lifted the Lithuanian army's morale. During the first half of February 18, the regiment of Saxon volunteers stationed between Kaišiadorys and Žiežmariai engaged in skirmishes on their line, and the joint force captured Jieznas in an operation held between February 10 and February 13. After this setback the Bolshevik 7th Riflemen Regiment began to disintegrate, and many soldiers deserted. The regiment could have been completely destroyed, if the Germans had not refused to pursue the retreating units.\n\nOn February 12 Bolshevik forces attacked Alytus. Lithuanian 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th companies of the 1st Infantry Regiment had to withstand pressure from the Red Army, while members of the German units left their posts. During this battle the first Lithuanian officer to die in the wars was killed: Antanas Juozapavičius, the commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment. After the loss of their commander the regiment began retreating towards Marijampolė. On the night of February 14–15, German forces retook Alytus.\n\nTowards the end of 1918 the officer Povilas Plechavičius, together with his brother Aleksandras, began organizing partisans in Skuodas. On February 9 the partisans took an oath, and on February 16 they paraded in the town square. A partisan unit commanded by army officers was also organized in Joniškėlis.\nThe movement of the Bolsheviks towards East Prussia worried Germany, and they sent volunteers (Brigade Shaulen) commanded by General Rüdiger von der Goltz to free the railroad line linking Liepāja, Mažeikiai, Radviliškis, and Kėdainiai. At the end of February the Lithuanian partisans, supported by German artillery, took Mažeikiai and Seda, and pursued Bolsheviks to Kuršėnai. On February 27, 1919, German volunteers supported by Plechavičius' partisans and Joniškėlis' partisans, defeated the \"Samogitian regiment\" in a battle near Luokė. By that time the regiment had been incorporated into the Red Army's 2nd Latvian International Riflemen Division. On the same day the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel) was declared. On March 7, 1919 the Germans took the town of Kuršėnai, on March 11 - Šiauliai, on March 12 - Radviliškis. On March 14 Lithuanian partisans and German forces captured Šeduva. The German troops were active in Lithuania until May 31, 1919.\n\nIn Kėdainiai a stationed volunteer regiment had secured its positions; in March it started small \"expeditions\" into nearby towns. Local volunteers with good knowledge of the location succeeded in driving Bolshevik supporters out of Ramygala, Truskava, and Krekenava, but these areas were soon recaptured by the Bolsheviks. These expeditions into several towns were successfully carried out until the end of March. As a reward for its successful operations, the volunteer regiment was given a name on March 22: the \"Separate Panevėžys Volunteer Regiment\". Due to a succession of losses, the Bolshevik forces stationed in Panevėžys and Kupiškis rebelled, and were quelled only by a Red Army Division from neighboring Latvia. The Bolshevik morale underwent deeper declines, and between March 19 and March 24 their forces left Panevėžys. Lithuanian forces entered the city on March 26, but the Red Army retook it on April 4.\n\nIn April the Lithuanian army began moving towards Vilnius, taking Žąsliai and Vievis, but their advances stopped on April 8. In the meantime, on April 19, the Polish army had taken Vilnius from the Bolsheviks and forced them to withdraw their left wing from territories south of the Neris River. The shortened front line that resulted allowed Lithuania to send stronger forces to northeastern Lithuania, and carry out operations there. By May 3, the Separate Panevėžys Volunteer Regiment, supported by the 18th regiment of Saxonian volunteers, had secured Siesikai, Atkočiai, and Deltuva. They had also captured Ukmergė; Lithuanian units were the first to enter the city.\n\nIn the beginning of March the mobilization began and Lithuanian forces increased their numbers. At the end of April the Lithuanian army's chain of command was reformed. General Silvestras Žukauskas was designated Chief of Staff, and on May 7 he assumed command of the entire Lithuanian army. A complete reorganization took place over the next new weeks, and the strengthened Lithuanian forces were now ready to push the Red Army back. Žukauskas decided to concentrate his Lithuanian forces in two areas. The first brigade, centered in the Ukmergė–Utena–Zarasai region, was called the \"Vilkmergė Group\"; the second brigade, centered in the Kėdainiai-Panevėžys-Rokiškis region, was called the \"Panevėžys Group\". Operations planning was undertaken during the middle of May.\n\nOn May 17 the reorganized army carried out its first operation, capturing the town of Kurkliai. Preparations were made for an advance on Anykščiai, which was taken on May 19, along with Skiemonys and Alanta. On May 22 the Lithuanian forces launched an advance on Utena, reaching the village of Diktarai. The initiative was met by a counterattack, and the Lithuanian forces retreated. The attack was stopped for several days, and line Alanta-Skiemonys-Anykščiai was taken. A drive towards Utena started on May 31, and the city was secured on June 2.\n\nThe Panevėžys Group launched a drive towards Panevėžys on May 18. On May 19 the brigade secured Panevėžys and Raguva; on May 20 its field staff moved to Panevėžys. The city withstood a Bolshevik attack that took place on May 21 and 22. On May 24 Žukauskas ordered both groups to push farther. The Panevėžys Group advanced towards Kupiškis and secured Subačius on May 25. On May 30 they took Rokiškis; Bolshevik forces left Kupiškis on the night of May 30–31, and Lithuania secured that city on June 1. The advance continued, and on the 10th of June Lithuanian forces reached the territory controlled by Latvian partisans (Green Guard) and supplied them with munitions.\n\nThe Lithuanian successes continued, and by the end of August, the Bolsheviks were defeated near Zarasai. On October 2 Lithuania took Griva, a suburb of Daugavpils. The Lithuanian forces stopped at the Daugava River near the border with Latvia, and the front line stabilized. The short-lived Litbel government was discontinued.\n\nOn July 12, 1920, Lithuania signed a peace treaty with the Russian SFSR. Russia recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region. This treaty was not recognized by Poland or by the short-lived Democratic Republic of Belarus. Several historians have asserted that despite its treaty with Russia, Lithuania was very close to being taken over by local communist forces that were backed by the Bolsheviks. In this view, it was only the Polish victory against the Soviets in the Polish–Soviet War that disrupted these plans.\n\nThe Bermontians, named for their leader Pavel Bermondt-Avalov and formally known as the West Russian Volunteer Army, were a mixed German-Russian army. The army included Russian prisoners of war, released by the German Empire after promising to fight against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, and members of the Freikorps, stationed in Latvia and Lithuania after Germany lost the war. The official goal of this army was to fight Bolsheviks along with Aleksandr Kolchak's forces, but its actual agenda was the retention of German power in the territories they had taken during World War I.\n\nAt first the Bermontians operated mostly in Latvia, but in June 1919, they crossed the Lithuanian–Latvian border and took the town of Kuršėnai. At that time the Lithuanians were engaged in battles with the Bolsheviks and could only issue diplomatic protests. By October, the Bermontians had taken considerable territories in western Lithuania (Samogitia), including the cities of Šiauliai, Biržai, and Radviliškis. After they had annexed a town, the Bermontians enforced a rule that only the Russian language could be used to conduct administration. They became notorious for robbing and looting the local populace, who began organizing local partisan groups.\n\nDuring October 1919, Lithuanian forces attacked the Bermontians, achieving an important victory on November 21 and 22 near Radviliškis, a major railway center. The Lithuanians collected significant spoils of war there, including 30 airplanes and 10 cannons. Later clashes were stopped by the intervention of an Entente representative, the French General Henri Niessel, who oversaw the withdrawal of German troops. The Lithuanian military followed the retreating Bermontian soldiers to prevent them from further looting and to ensure their complete evacuation. By December 15, the Bermontians were completely removed from Lithuania.\n\nIn June 1920 the Russian army had taken Vilnius. Shortly after their defeat in the Battle of Warsaw, the withdrawing Red Army handed the city over to Lithuania under the terms of the peace treaty signed on July 12. Negotiations were started in an attempt to avoid an armed conflict between Poland and Lithuania. On October 7, the Suwałki Agreement was signed. However, on October 8, before the agreement was to formally take effect, General Lucjan Żeligowski, acting on orders from the Polish leader Józef Piłsudski, staged a mutiny by Polish troops. The Vilnius and the Suvalkai regions were overrun. Initially the Polish forces did not meet much armed resistance, and a later Lithuanian counter-offensive was stopped by Military Commission of League of Nations. Since the Vilnius region was controlled by Poland, the Lithuanian government declared Kaunas the temporary capital of Lithuania. The dispute over Vilnius would continue throughout the interwar period.\n\nA staged mutiny arranged by the Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski was carried out by Polish forces led by general Lucjan Żeligowski. These forces took control of Vilnius in the fall of 1920. However, shortly after this, Lithuanian forces started to gain the upper hand in this conflict and the 'mutinous' forces gained support from the regular Polish army. This military action is considered as a continuation of the Polish-Lithuanian war in historiography.\n\n\n"}

By Nyborg's train station and the motor way exit is a series of fast food restaurants, gas stations and grocery stores, as well as industries, including Daloon. At the motorway exit is also an indoor public swimming pool and a sports- and recreation center. A series of hotels are located along the north-eastern shore of the city, facing the Great Belt Strait. Nyborg Prison is located on \"Vindingevej\".\n\nNyborg Cemetery has been used as a cemetery since 1537, where it was used for victims of the black plague. A chapel was built on the cemetery in 1605, but torn down again sixty years later in 1665 when the fortifications of Nyborg city were being expanded. Parts of these fortifications eventually became a part of the cemetery, with cemetery expansions in 1816, 1833 and 1855. A new chapel was built in 1870 and in 1900 a residence for the gravedigger was built on the grounds. In 1950, permissions to expand the cemetery further was approved, another part of the fortifications becoming part of the cemetery. These fortifications were not to be removed, however. The expansion was finished in 1957, with the fortifications used as burial sites and the ground below for urns. The cemetery today covers 30,673 m. A book about the cemetery was written in 2013. It was named after a piece from a newspaper from 1886, naming Nyborg Cemetery as the most beautiful cemetery on Fyn.\n\nNyborg Prison is a closed state prison, located on \"Vindingevej\" in the outskirts of the city of Nyborg. Construction was approved by the city council in 1911, and the prison was finished in 1913. Among the locations suggested as the location of the prison was Nyborg Castle, though Minister of Justice Frits Bülow did not find the castle suitable for a prison. The prison was built by Victor Nyebølle, and intended to house young prisoners of both genders. To make this work, the prison was built as two separate buildings. Many new methods were tested during the prison's early years, including mandatory sport and education. It has been a closed state prison since 1973. Today it employs around 225 people, with around two thirds being correctional officers. The prison offers many different jobs for the inmates, as well as a variety of educations.\n\nUllerslev is located 10 kilometers to the north-west of Nyborg. It has a population of 2,758 people (2018). Before the 2007 Municipal Reform, this was the seat of Ullerslev Municipality. The forests of \"Kirsebærhaven\", \"Bondemose Skov\" and \"Skovmærket\" are located in Ullerslev.\n\nIn the town of Ullerslev are several shops, as well as industries, including a dairy factory. Ullerslev Church is located here.\n\nØrbæk is located 14 kilometers south-west of Nyborg. It has a population of 1,643 people (2018). Before the 2007 Municipal Reform, this was the seat of Ørbæk Municipality.\n\nØrbæk has many shops and facilities, including sports facilities and a library. Ørbæk Brewery is located in the town, and the manor of Ørbæklunde is located near the town. There are also dolmen and passage graves located near the town.\n\nSkabohuse is a small village north of Nyborg, connected by the street of \"Skaboeshusevej.\" A campsite is located in Skabohuse. West of Skabohuse is the village of Regstrup, where the Juelsberg Manor is located.\n\nAunslev, north-west of Nyborg, has a population of 408 people (2018), has been the location of several significant Viking-related archeological discoveries, including a piece of jewellery in gold, in the shape of Jesus. This figure is the oldest of its kind found in Denmark. In the village are also Aunslev Church and Aunslev Hospital, which is under care of the church.\n\nHjulby is located north-west of Nyborg, and has a population of 400 people (2018).

It has sports-facilities and is also home to Vindinge Church.\n\nRefsvindinge is located south-west of Nyborg, and has a population of 566 people (2018). In addition to Refsvindinge Church, Refsvindinge Brewery is also located in this village.\n\nThe other villages in Nyborg Municipality are: Blankenborg, Blæsenborg, Bovense, Brændemose, Bynkel, Bækstrup, Ellested, Ellinge, Flødstrup, Frørup, Gamle Langeskov, Hannesborg, Hedemarken, Herrested, Kastel, Kissendrup, Kogsbølle, Kokkehaverne, Kongshøj, Korkendrup, Kragelund, Kullerup, Lamdrup, Lamdrup, Langtved, Langå, Lindeskov, Miklenborg, Mullerup, Måre, Nederby, Nordenhuse, Pårup, Ringholm, Rosilde, Rørbæk, Sentved, Skalkendrup, Skellerup, Slude, Stenhave, Sulkendrup, Svindinge, Såderup, Såderup Mark, Søgyden, Tårup, Villumstrup and Øksendrup.\n\nOn January 1, 2007, Nyborg municipality was, as the result of \"Kommunalreformen\" (\"The Municipal Reform\" of 2007), merged with Ørbæk and Ullerslev municipalities to form a new Nyborg municipality.\n\nNyborg's municipal council consists of 25 members, elected every four years. The municipal council has nine political committees.\n\nBelow are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.\n\nThe city of Nyborg is heavily characterised by its history as a garrison city and a former royal residence. In addition to the sights listed below, there are also a series of statues and sculptures found in the city. The most well-known of these is known as \"Den med Fisken\" (English: The One with the Fish) by Harvey Martin, located next to the moat on Østerhavn.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a large amount of castles and manors on the island of Funen. Many parks and forests owned by the manors are open to the public, or used for private hunting. Many castles are used for events and hotels.\n\n\n\n\n\nNyborg Castle is located near the center of Nyborg city, and is surrounded by fortifications, the 'castle lake' and a moat that run along the center of the city. The castle if first mentioned in 1193, when Canute VI held a meeting in it. Before then, the king were housed in Hjulby, outside Nyborg, and the castle was established in that period. A curtain wall was built, and there has likely been several wooden buildings within the walls. In the first half of the 1200s, a building was constructed in two floors, much of which still remain today. The king likely held his meetings in the upper floor of this construction. During the 1300s and 1400s, the castle was improve upon, with a new floor and several new buildings. In 1282, Eric V completed the constitution of Denmark in Nyborg Castle. In 1287, Eric V's alleged murderers were sentenced on the castle. In the 1520s, Frederick I planned to make Nyborg his official residence, but that never happened. Signs of his plans were obvious, however, with major projects on the castle planned.\n\nThe castle was captured by Swedish troops during the Dano-Swedish War, following the Battle of Nyborg. The Swedish troops sent all valuables home to Sweden, while they burned much of the furniture. Following this, the king was no longer interested in living in the castle, and it was handed over to the military. Nyborg worked as a garrison, with the castle now being used for military purposes. Much of the castle was no longer needed as was taken apart, and the materials used to build fortifications. The castle was used as armoury and storage.\n\nAfter the garrison was disestablished in 1913, the castle was turned into a museum, which it has been since then. In 2017, a large project to renovate and expand the museum was begun, with plans to finish in 2021.\n\nThe fortifications, ramparts and moats surrounding Nyborg Castle stretch out along the center of the city. The moats appear as they did in the Middle Ages, with the same water regulation systems still in use. Three of the original bulwarks still exist, with the remaining having been torn down during city expansions. Two of those bulwarks are located around Nyborg Castle, and are known as \"the Queen's Bulwark (Danish: Dronningens Bastion)\" and \"the Crown Prince's Bulwark (Danish: Kronprinsens Bastion)\". Those are surrounded by the original ramparts, which today act as park areas. On the Queen's Bulwark is a water tower from 1899, built by Emil Swanenflügel. The water tower was protected in 1997. The third bulwark is called \"Prince Carl's Bulwark (Danish: Prins Carls Bastion)\", and is slightly smaller. It also acts as a park area.\n\nBordering the city of Nyborg to the south is the Holckenhavn Castle. The castle owns 900 acres, and perform forestry, farming, hunting and renting out of residential houses. The castle itself can be rented for weddings and similar events, and also have hotel-services. \nThe manor originates from around the late 1300s, where it was owned by Anders Jacobsen Ulfeldt. The manor was kept in the Ulfeldt family, and in 1534-1536 during the Count's Feud, the manor was owned by Knud Ebbesen Ulfeldt, who defended the castle of Gjorslev on Sjælland against the peasants. He supported Christian III after the war. Knud Ebbesen Ulfeldt died in 1540, and the manor was given to his son, Corfitz Ulfeldt. He, however, was secretary at the Danish chancery, and the day-to-day management of the manor was instead performed by his mother, Anne Eriksdatter Hardenberg. Jacob Ulfeldt gained the manor after Anne Eriksdatter Hardenberg's death in 1564. Jacob Ulfeldt fought under both Herluf Trolle and Daniel Rantzau in the Seven Years' War. After performing well in the war, he was sent to Russia as a delegation, but failed to improve Denmark's relationship with Russia. This upset the king, and Jacob Ulfedt spent the rest of his days taking care of Holcekhavn Castle. He made large improvements, and expanded the manor significantly during this time. In 1616, the manor was sold to Ellen Marsvin, who made big changes to the interior of the castle. During the Dano-Swedish War, the manor was owned by Leonora Christine and Corfitz Ulfeldt. Holckenhavn Castle was largely ignored by the Swedes, due to Corfitz Ulfedt's relationship with the Swedish king, and he later joined the Swedish army. After the war, Corfitz Ulfeldt escaped to Germany to avoid the charges for treason, while Leonora Christine was imprisoned. In 1672, Holckenhavn was awarded to Eiler Holck, after his success in the Dano-Swedish War. The war had taken its economical toll on the manor though, and it wasn't until 1760 that the owner Erik Rosenkrantz Holck managed to turn this around. The manor has been owned by the Holck family since then.\n\nLykkesholm Castle is located near Ørbæk, where it is used for events and hunting. The manor owns 299 acres. The castle was temporarily owned by Margaret I, who gave it away to Henneke Olufsen Bjørn a few days after acquiring it. Christen Thomesen Sehested acquired the castle in 1640, and began significant plans to expand the manor. He bought a large amount of surrounding farms, and even a church in a nearby village. He was given another series of farms after lending money to the king. He eventually became so rich that he was able to donate grain to poor children in Odense. After Sehested's death and the abolishment of absolute monarchy in Denmark, the manor ran into debt and were in financial trouble until 1730 when it was bought by Theodor Adeler, who turned things around. Anne Cathrine Bendtz got control of the manor in 1778, and she made significant changes to the it, selling the parts they didn't need while also establishing new plantations and constructing new buildings. In 1914, Lykkesholm was bought by Christian Ove Sehestedt Juul from neighbouring manor Ravnholt, who still own Lykkesholm today.\n\nThere are twenty lutheran churches in Nyborg Municipality, including Stensgaards Church in Nyborg Prison. The other nineteen churches and the surrounding cemeteries are open to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\nNyborg Church (also known as Church of Our Lady. Danish: Vor Frue Kirke) is located in the center of Nyborg, and was built in 1375–1428. It was renovated in the 1970s and again in 2005.\n\nThe church has two organs, from 1973 by Poul-Gerhard Andersen and 1830 by P.U.F. Demant. The crucifix is the only piece of inventory from the church's opening in 1428. It is decorated with biblical depictions. Maja Lisa Engelhardt created the altar crucifix, of gilded bronze, in 2011. Maja Lisa Engelhardt also created a mosaic for the church in 2015. The largest of the church's chandeliers was donated in 1640 by the mayor's widow, Sidsel Knudsdatter. The other chandelier was donated by mayor Mads Lerke in 1589. The renaissance baptismal font was donated to the church in 1585 by mayor Peder Jensen Skriver. The other baptismal font is Romanesque style in granite, from 1100. Inside the church is a gate from 1649, built by Christian IV's smith, Caspar Fincke. The pulpit is from 1653, made by Anders Mortensen in Odense. The pulpit's staircase is even older. The church has a set of wooden figures of John the Apostle and Jeremiah. Like the pulpit, they were also carved by Anders Mortensen. A candle globe, made by local artisan Flemming Knudsen, was added to the church in 2008.\n\nThe church's turret clock, nicknamed \"the Syrian tank\" (Danish: Den syriske kampvogn) was replaced by an electric movement in 1972. The original mechanical movement was built by Henrik Kyhl from Copenhagen, and initially created for Viborg Cathedral, who couldn't afford it. It was instead bought by Nyborg Church. In 2002 it was donated to \"Post- og Telemuseet\" in Copenhagen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1826717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826717", "title": "Volkswagen 181", "text": "Volkswagen 181\n\nThe Volkswagen Type 181 is a two-wheel drive, four-door, convertible, manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen from 1968 to 1983. Originally developed for the West German Army, the Type 181 also entered the civilian market as the Kurierwagen (“courier car”) in West Germany, the Trekker (RHD Type 182) in the United Kingdom, the Thing in the United States (1973–74), the Safari in Mexico and South America, and Pescaccia in Italy. Civilian sales ended after model year 1980.\n\nManufactured in Wolfsburg, West Germany (1968–74), Hannover, West Germany (1974–83), Puebla, Mexico (1970–80), and Jakarta, Indonesia (1973–80), the Type 181 shared its mechanicals with Volkswagen's Type 1 (Beetle) and the pre-1968 Volkswagen Microbus, its floor pan with the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, and its concept with the company's Kübelwagen, which had been used by the German military during World War II.\n\nAll four doors were removable and interchangeable, the windshield folded flat and the convertible roof could be removed for \"al fresco\" driving. The spartan interior featured vinyl covered bucket seats, painted sheet metal, drain holes and perforated rubber mats. A\nfiberglass hardtop and trunk-mounted auxiliary heater were offered as individual options.\n\nDuring the 1960s, several European governments began cooperating on development of a vehicle known as the Europa Jeep, a lightweight, amphibious four-wheel drive vehicle that could be mass-produced for use by various national military and government groups. \nDevelopment of the vehicle proved time-consuming, however, and the West German government was in need of a limited number of light, inexpensive, durable transport vehicles that could fulfill their basic needs while the Europa Jeep was being developed and put into production.\n\nAlthough Volkswagen had been approached during the 1950s about building such a vehicle, and had subsequently passed on the proposition, the then-current management of the company saw the project as having some amount of potential as a consumer vehicle; Mexican customers were asking for something that could handle rural roads better than the Type 1, which was a large seller in Mexico at the time, and the popularity of VW-based dune buggies within the U.S. made executives think that a durable, fun, off-road-capable vehicle would become attractive to many buyers. \nVW could keep cost to a minimum and thus maximize profitability by using existing parts. \n\nLike the World War II era Type 82 Kübelwagen, the Type 181 used mechanical parts and a rear-engine platform, manual transmission and a flat-4 engine derived from that of the Type 1. \n\nThe floorpans came from the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, which had a wider floorpan than the Beetle. \nRear swing axle suspension with reduction gearing from the discontinued split-screen Volkswagen Transporter was used until 1973, when it was replaced with double-jointed axles used by Porsche and IRS semi-trailing arm setup as used on the 1303 and US-spec Beetles.\n\nCivilian sales began in mainland Europe and Mexico during 1971; in the U.S. in 1972; and briefly in Britain in 1975, where it failed to sell well and was dropped fairly quickly.\n\nThe model was dropped from the American lineup for 1975 as it failed to meet new, stricter US safety standards. The Type 181 was reclassified as a passenger vehicle, and thus subject to stricter safety standards. The Windshield Intrusion Rule of the 1975 DOT standard called for a greater distance between the front seat occupants and the front window glass.\n\nThe Europa Jeep was the result of a NATO plan to have a vehicle whereby each European NATO makers all combined to build a light-duty patrol vehicle. \n\nThe Volkswagen 181 was only supposed to a fill in until the time that the Europa Jeep was ready. From 1968 until 1979, over 50,000 Type 181s were delivered to the NATO forces. \nBy 1979 the Europa Jeep project had fallen apart completely and was abandoned, and the West German government began supplementing their consumption of 181s with the new front-engined Type 183 Iltis.\n\nDespite the West German government's switch to the Type 183, European and Mexican sales of the civilian 181 continued through 1980, and several organizations, including NATO, continued to purchase military-spec Type 181 units through 1983, finding their reliability and low purchase and maintenance costs attractive.\n\nMilitary 181s attain a higher ride height and lower effective gearing by using reduction boxes, a form of portal axles. 181s without reduction boxes feature a transmission similar to the Beetle but with a slower gearing by use of different ring and pinion gears and have stronger, more flexible CV axles. Most mechanical parts are interchangeable with those of other VW models. Optional dual oil bath air cleaners increased filtering ability in dusty environments, and low noise ignition systems were fitted to military cars to be used for radio communication.\n\nThe engine is a 4-cylinder rear mounted petrol engine.\n\n\n\n"}

He was ennobled in March 1401, and became six years later a councillor of Louis II, duke of Anjou and king of Sicily. A partisan of the house of Orléans, he was appointed chancellor to Isabeau of Bavaria on 29 January 1414, on 20 July 1414 commissary of the mint, and in June 1416 chancellor to the count of Ponthieu, afterwards Charles VII of France. On 16 August 1416 he bought the barony of Trèves in Anjou, and henceforward bore the title of seigneur of Trèves.\n\nWhen Paris was surprised by the Burgundians on the night of 29 May 1418 he assisted Tanguy du Chastel in saving the Dauphin Charles. His devotion to the cause of the latter having brought down on him the wrath of John the Fearless, he was excluded from the political amnesty known as the peace of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, though he retained his seat on the king's council. He was by the dauphin's side when John the Fearless was murdered at the bridge of Montereau on 10 September 1419. He resigned the seals at the beginning of 1422; but he continued to exercise great influence, and In 1426 he effected a reconciliation between the king and John VI, Duke of Brittany.\n\nHaving been captured by Jean de Langeac, seneschal of Auvergne, in August 1426, he was shut up for three months in the château of Usson. When set at liberty he returned to court, where he staunchly supported Joan of Arc against all the cabals that menaced her. It was he who signed the patent of nobility for the Arc family in December 1429. \n\nIn 1430 he was once more entrusted with an embassy to Brittany.\n\nHaving retired from political life in 1436, he died on 28 January 1443, and was interred at Trèves, where his epitaph may still be seen.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826771", "title": "Slam Dunk Contest", "text": "Slam Dunk Contest\n\nThe NBA Slam Dunk Contest (officially known as the AT&T Slam Dunk Contest for sponsorship reasons) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) competition held during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The contest was inaugurated by the American Basketball Association (ABA) at its All-Star Game in 1976 in Denver, the same year the slam dunk was legalized in the NCAA. As a result of the ABA–NBA merger later that year there would not be another slam dunk contest at the professional level until 1984. The contest has adopted several formats over the years, including, until 2014, the use of fan voting, via text-messaging, to determine the winner of the final round.\n\nThe very first slam dunk contest was won by Larry Nance Sr. of the Phoenix Suns at the 1984 NBA All-Star Game. The current champion of the NBA Dunk Contest is Derrick Jones Jr. of the Miami Heat.\n\nOn January 27, 1976 at McNichols Sports Arena during halftime of the 1976 ABA All Star Game the first-ever Slam Dunk Contest was held, which was won by Julius Erving of the New York Nets over David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets, Artis Gilmore of the Kentucky Colonels, and George Gervin and Larry Kenon of the San Antonio Spurs. There was a format each competitor had to follow in which they must attempt 5 dunks in a row under two minutes. One from a standing position, one from a distance of ten feet away from the basket (which is basically the bottom of the semi circle that surrounds the free throw line in the Key. The next 3 were freestyle positions, one coming in from the left side of the basket, one coming in from the right side of the basket and finally from either corner down the baseline to the basket. They were judged on artistic ability, imagination, body flow as well as fan response.\n\nArtis Gilmore went first followed by George Gervin, Larry Kenon, David Thompson and finally Erving. George Gervin and David Thompson both missed a dunk during their routines which counted as a zero (scores were not announced to the audience). David Thompson did a 360 degree dunk to finish his routine. All competitors had to perform a dunk from 10 feet, but Julius Erving started marking his steps from the free throw line (15 feet away). He then completed a dunk from the free throw line.\n\nThis was a season long event similar to 1977–1978 NBA Horse event. There were 22 competitors throughout the event (one for each team at the time), including future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Thompson, Alex English, Moses Malone, George Gervin, and Elvin Hayes and took place in multiple venues throughout the season. Darnell Hillman was named the winner that season, beating out the Golden State Warriors' Larry McNeill in the championship round on June 5, 1977 in Portland.\n\nThe NBA reintroduced the Slam Dunk Contest in 1984 at its birthplace in Denver. Phoenix's Larry Nance defeated the original Dunk contest winner Julius Erving in the final round. Dominique Wilkins won the contest the following year, but in 1986 his Atlanta Hawks teammate Spud Webb made history when he defeated Wilkins in the final, preventing him from retaining his title. Standing a mere 5 feet 7 inches tall, Webb became the shortest player ever to win the contest, a distinction that he still holds. Chicago's Michael Jordan won back-to-back dunk contest victories in 1987 and in 1988. His victory over Wilkins in 1988 in Chicago finished with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line for his third dunk to win the contest. However, the announcers did note that Wilkins was given abnormally low score for his breathtaking third dunk, a 45, allowing Jordan to win it by 2 with his perfect 50. To this day, the allegations of \"\"home cooking\"\" still float around surrounding the event (it was held on Jordan's home court; one of the judges was former Chicago Bears star Gale Sayers; and another judge, former NBA star Tom Hawkins, is a Chicago native) and until the competition in 2020, was considered arguably the most controversial of the slam dunk competitions. Extensive debate continues whether Wilkins 3rd dunk should have scored higher than a 45 and whether Jordan's second dunk, which scored a 47, was a superior creative effort to Wilkins third dunk. The following year in Houston, New York's Kenny \"Sky\" Walker, a last-minute replacement whose father died just days beforehand, upset Portland's Clyde Drexler, the hometown favorite and Houston native who was seen as the favorite, being that Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were not competing. 1986 champ Spud Webb finished 3rd, while Shelton Jones finished 4th. Though Jordan & Wilkins still played in the All-Star Game, Jordan chose not to compete due to a minor injury, and Wilkins did not compete in the competition due to a hand injury.\n\nIn 1990, Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks edged out Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings to win his second Slam Dunk Contest (first won in 1985 over Michael Jordan). Kenny Smith scored high points for originality with his signature dunk – he started by turning his back to the basket, bouncing the ball backward between his legs and off the backboard, then turning and grabbing it in the air and reverse dunking it. As the 1990s progressed, stars such as Jordan, Wilkins and Drexler sometimes declined to participate and were replaced by less-known players. Harold Miner was a standout in 1993, winning the contest with a reverse power dunk, reaching between his legs and down to his feet in mid-air before sending the ball down. In 1994 and 1997 respectively, Isaiah Rider and Kobe Bryant won the contest. Rider would win with a spectacular, between-the-legs dunk, reminiscent of the Orlando Woolridge effort in the 1984 contest, but wasn't able to repeat in 1995, missing the same dunk on several tries, opening the way for Miner to grab his second slam dunk title in three years. In 1998, the Slam Dunk Contest was replaced with the WNBA-NBA 2Ball Contest. In 1999, there was no All-Star Game due to the NBA lockout.\n\nAfter a one-All Star Weekend layoff (the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor-shortened 1999 season), the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest back for the 2000 All-Star Weekend in Oakland, California. It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league's history, featuring a great showdown between eventual winner Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, his cousin and then-teammate Tracy McGrady, and the Houston Rockets' Steve Francis. Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks, including two 360 windmills, a honey dip, and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounced alley-oop from McGrady. The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant, and despite innovative efforts by the likes of Desmond Mason and Jason Richardson, the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest.\n\nIn 2005, the Slam Dunk Contest returned to its birthplace in Denver. With the spectacular dunks of prior contests, there was buzz that the dunk competition could regain the popularity it had in the 1980s. The Phoenix Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire alley-ooping 360 off a soccer-style header from teammate Steve Nash; J. R. Smith putting it around his back and dunking, and the new champion, Josh Smith alley-ooping over Kenyon Martin all wowed the crowd with their maneuvers. With the change in the rules requiring an additional teammate starting in the second round, they proved there were indeed many ways to dunk a]] took the title with a great dunk-off. One of his most exciting dunks was a high-flying dunk over former Slam Dunk Contest winner, 5'7\" Spud Webb. The 2006 Slam Dunk Contest was also the first Dunk Contest in history to have a \"Dunk Off\", the equivalent to a Dunk Contest overtime, between Knicks point guard Nate Robinson and shooting guard Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers. Many fans argue that Iguodala should have won the contest, as it took Robinson fourteen attempts before finally completing his dunk. Iguodala pulled off a dunk where he started out of bounds from the right side of the baseline while teammate Allen Iverson bounced the ball off the back of the right side of the backboard. Iguodala caught the ball in mid-air behind the backboard, spun around to the other side while ducking his head (to avoid colliding with the backboard) and dunked it with his right hand.\n\nOn February 17, 2007, the contest was held in Las Vegas. Judges for the event were all past winners: Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Kobe Bryant, Julius Erving, and Vince Carter. The title was taken by the Boston Celtics' Gerald Green, who, among other dunks, jumped over reigning champ Nate Robinson while covering his face – a homage to 1991 winner, Dee Brown, whose jersey Green had worn. He also scored a perfect fifty with his last slam, a windmill over a table. Other noteworthy dunks include a dunk by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard, who, while making his dunk, stuck a sticker with his smiling face on the backboard a reported 12'6\" from the ground, two and a half feet beyond the regulation NBA rim.\n\nOn February 16, 2008, the contest was held in New Orleans. Judges for the event included Darryl Dawkins, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Julius Erving, and Magic Johnson. The title was taken by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. Howard's most noteworthy dunk came during the first round, his second dunk overall, when he took off his jersey to reveal a Superman shirt and cape. With teammate Jameer Nelson's assistance he would make a leaping dunk from just in front of the free-throw line after a running start, throwing the ball through the rim from a few feet away. Other noteworthy dunks included the first round slam by Jamario Moon while the previous year's winner, Gerald Green, relied heavily on theatrics by blowing out a cupcake with a birthday candle on the rim before dunking (a jam he termed \"The Birthday Cake\"). For the first time ever, fan voting determined the outcome of the final round of the contest; Howard beat Green for the trophy by claiming 78% of the fans' votes.\n\nNate Robinson won the 2009 contest on February 14 in Phoenix, Arizona. The 5'9\" guard dressed all in green as \"Krypto-Nate\" (a portmanteau of 'Nate' and Kryptonite) and jumped over 6'11\" Dwight Howard characterized as Superman. He defeated Howard in the finals by a fan vote of 52–48 percent. J. R. Smith and Rudy Fernández also competed.\n\nNate Robinson won the 2010 contest on February 13 in Dallas, becoming the first 3-time Slam Dunk champion. Robinson took on Shannon Brown of the Los Angeles Lakers, Gerald Wallace of the Charlotte Bobcats, and DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors. DeRozan earned his spot in the competition by defeating Los Angeles Clippers guard Eric Gordon in the inaugural Sprite Slam Dunk-In held the night before the actual dunk contest. Robinson and DeRozan advanced to the final round, where Robinson's double-pump reverse dunk helped seal a 51% to 49% victory.\n\nBlake Griffin won the 2011 slam dunk contest by jumping and dunking over the hood of a Kia sedan on February 19 in Los Angeles. JaVale McGee of the Washington Wizards, DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors, and Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder all competed against Griffin. Griffin and McGee advanced to the final round, where Griffin stole the show, winning the contest with 68% of the vote.\n\nJeremy Evans won the 2012 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest by performing a dunk over Kevin Hart on February 25 in Orlando, Florida with 29% of the votes. Joining Evans were Chase Budinger of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Indiana Pacers, and Derrick Williams of the Minnesota Timberwolves. While George awed the crowd with a dunk with the lights turned off, Evans had perhaps the dunk of the contest by jumping teammate Gordon Hayward, catching two balls from Hayward, and dunking it.\n\nTerrence Ross won the 2013 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest after a tomahawk dunk in tribute to former Toronto Raptors player Vince Carter, as well as a between-the-legs dunk performed while jumping over a ball boy. Ross took on Jeremy Evans of the Utah Jazz, Eric Bledsoe of the Los Angeles Clippers, Kenneth Faried of the Denver Nuggets, Gerald Green of the Indiana Pacers, and James White of the New York Knicks. Evans advanced to the final round to defend his title of slam dunk champion, but was thwarted by Ross. Ross carried the momentum of his near-perfect first round, in which he scored a 99 out of a possible 100, with a stellar final round. Ross won the competition decisively, earning 58% of the vote.\n\nTeam East, composed of dunkers Paul George, defending champion Terrence Ross, and John Wall won the 2014 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in commanding fashion. Under the new team format, they dominated the Freestyle Round, capping it off with a pass off the backboard from Ross to Wall, then off the shot clock from Wall to George for the finish. In the Battle Round, Ross defeated Damian Lillard with a through the legs dunk from rapper Drake, George took down Harrison Barnes with a 360-degree, through the legs finish, and Wall defeated Ben McLemore by jumping over the Wizards' mascot G-Man and throwing down a reverse on the first try. Though Team East are the official winners, Wall was voted by fans as the Dunker of the Night.\n\nTo the delight of NBA fans, the 2015 contest was changed back to its original format, as the Freestyle Round as well as the teams were taken out. The 4 dunkers competing were all up-and-coming players: The Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Timberwolves' Zach LaVine, the Magic's Victor Oladipo, and the Nets' Mason Plumlee. LaVine took home the hardware with dunks that included a between-the-legs reverse, a behind-the-back slam in which he caught it in midair, a between-the-legs lefthanded dunk, and finished with a between-the-legs dunk as he caught it off the pole behind the backboard. Similar to Howard with Superman, LaVine did his first dunk with a cultural homage, wearing Michael Jordan's jersey from \"Space Jam\".\n\nZach LaVine won the 2016 slam dunk contest with incredibly talented dunks, from a windmill from the free throw line to a sensational between-the-legs reverse dunk. Aaron Gordon (runner-up) of the Orlando Magic, Will Barton of the Denver Nuggets and Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons also competed.\n\nMany people, including 2010 winner Nate Robinson, thought that the 2011 contest was rigged to allow up-and-coming star Blake Griffin to win and that runner-up JaVale McGee deserved to win. It was even disputed if Griffin even legitimately qualified for the finals since his final dunk got a perfect score but was basically a copy of DeMar DeRozan's first dunk with a lower degree of difficulty. Ben Maller of Fox Sports Radio reported that a media advisory sent out by the NBA over an hour before the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest began already referring to Blake Griffin as the winner.\n\nThere have been 25 players crowned the best dunkers in the NBA. Nate Robinson is the only player to win the event three times. Five are two-time winners: Dominique Wilkins, Michael Jordan, Harold Miner, Jason Richardson and Zach LaVine.\n\nSource:\n\nSlam Dunk Contest champions by franchise\n\nBold denotes winner(s) of that year.\n\n1984\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n1988\n\"Ron Harper (Cleveland) was to participate but withdrew due to injury.\"\n1989\n\n1990\n1991\"Beginning with this year, final round competitors were allowed three dunks, with the two highest scores comprising the total.\"\n1992\n\n1993\"The two highest score dunks of three in each round constituted the competitor's score.Shawn Kemp (Seattle) was scheduled to compete but was injured.\"\n1994\"In the first round, each competitor was allowed 90 seconds to do as many dunks as he chooses with one overall score.

One is that players who often compete in these contests are seen as dunkers only (with the obvious exceptions of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Julius Erving), which is why notable high flying athletes like Shawn Marion and LeBron James have sometimes refused to participate. High-profile players such as Dwyane Wade and Charles Barkley have also declined to participate citing it as an unnecessary risk to injury. In the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tracy McGrady injured his wrist while performing a dunk. Also in the 1995 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tony Dumas hurt his knee while performing his \"Texas Twister\" dunk. Although a longtime critic, LeBron James said he would perform in the 2010 Slam Dunk Contest. This decision was made after watching the 2009 dunk contest when Dwight Howard and Nate Robinson went at it. However, he withdrew his statement once the All-Star Weekend came around.\n\nThe 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Competition between Nate Robinson and Andre Iguodala drew much criticism because players were not penalized for missing a dunk attempt. Consequently, Robinson attempted a single dunk 14 times before completing it. Prior to the 2007 competition, the NBA changed a few rules to prevent excessive dunk attempts. Each participant has two minutes to complete their dunk. At the end of the two minutes allotted, they then have their number of dunk attempts limited to two.\n\n"}

It was released as the album's second single in the fourth quarter of 1991 in the United States and the first quarter of 1992 elsewhere. The protagonist of this synthesizer-heavy ballad laments an ex-lover who has moved on, and though she tries she \"can't let go.\"\n\nCarey had fallen out with her songwriting partner Ben Margulies following a financial dispute, and her record label suggested that she work with the other producers of her debut album such as Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden. She chose Walter Afanasieff, who had produced her second single \"Love Takes Time\" (1990), and \"Can't Let Go\" was one of the songs they created. After the release of the single \"Emotions,\" \"Can't Let Go\" was promoted on both \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" in September 1991 and \"Saturday Night Live\" in November 1991 when she was the musical guest in the episode which featured Linda Hamilton as the host. \"Can't Let Go\" was later included on Carey's compilation album \"The Ballads\" (2008).\n\n\"Can't Let Go\" is written in the key of F major (with minor interminglings), ascending up to F major (with similar qualities) to close the song out — a common pop tonal effect. Mariah's vocals range from the low note of F to the high note of B, at a moderately slow tempo of 81 beats per minute, according to Musicnotes.com.\n\nAllmusic editor Ashley S. Battel wrote that \"yearning cries for a lost love in \"Can't Let Go\" serves to send the listener on a musical journey through time filled with varying emotions. Los Angeles Times editor Dennis Hunt wrote that in this song Mariah is playing a wounded lover. Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone wrote that \"moody grandeur\" of this song will sound great on radio.\n\nCarey's first five American singles (most recently \"Emotions\") had reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Can't Let Go\" ended the streak when it reached number two (kept from the top spot by \"All 4 Love\" by Color Me Badd), and spent 17 weeks in the top 40. The record company had taken the single off from sales before it could reach number 1, in an attempt to boost sales of \"Emotions\". The song topped the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, where it became Carey's fourth number one single; the next single \"Make It Happen\" would break that streak. \"Can't Let Go\" ranked 23rd on the 1992 Hot 100 year-end charts.\n\n\"Can't Let Go\" reached the UK top 20 and the Canadian top ten. It became her lowest peaking single at the time in all of the major Anglophone singles markets (with the exception of the UK), and failed to make the Australian top 50.\n\nThe single's video, directed by Jim Sonzero, features Carey wearing an evening gown and her hair in a bun. Filmed in black and white, the video starts and closes with shots of a rose open and closed respectively.\n\nA radio edit of the song was promoted to radio and used for the video instead of the original song, and the edit eliminates the seraphic pre-intro and removes all of Carey's high notes at the song's beginning and end. Like Carey's previous U.S. singles, \"Can't Let Go\" won a BMI Pop Award in 1993.\n\nIn 2015, rapper Rick Ross released a remix version of the song on his eighth studio album \"Black Market\", titled \"Can't Say No\", in which Carey re-recorded her part with various new lyrics.\n\nIn 1992, writers Sharon Taber and Ron Gonzalez filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Carey and Afanasieff citing that \"Can't Let Go\" was taken from their unknown song, \"Right Before My Eyes.\" The plaintiffs demanded to obtain copies of the studio recording tapes to see if conversation between Carey and Afanasieff would prove them guilty. However, after being reviewed, the only guilty fear apparent was Mariah Carey quoted as saying \"Can't Let Go\" was sounding \"too much like our other song.\" The lawsuit was later dropped or settled out of court.\n\nWorldwide CD and cassette single\n\nEuropean CD maxi-single 1\n\nEuropean CD maxi-single 2\nRecording\n\nPersonnel\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Emotions\".\n\nList of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1992 (U.S.)\n"}
{"id": "1826782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826782", "title": "Nonviolent revolution", "text": "Nonviolent revolution\n\nA nonviolent revolution is a revolution using mostly campaigns with civil resistance, including various forms of nonviolent protest, to bring about the departure of governments seen as entrenched and authoritarian. While many campaigns of civil resistance are intended for much more limited goals than revolution, generally a nonviolent revolution is characterized by simultaneous advocacy of democracy, human rights, and national independence in the country concerned. In some cases a campaign of civil resistance with a revolutionary purpose may be able to bring about the defeat of a dictatorial regime only if it obtains a degree of support from the armed forces, or at least their benevolent neutrality.\n\nAn effective campaign of civil resistance, and even the achievement of a nonviolent revolution, may be possible in a particular case despite the controlling government taking brutal measures against protesters; the commonly held belief that most revolutions which have happened in dictatorial regimes were bloody or violent uprisings is not borne out by historical analysis. Nonviolent revolutions in the 20th century became more successful and more common, especially in the 1980s as Cold War political alliances which supported status quo governance waned.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, intellectuals in the Soviet Union and other Communist states, and in some other countries, began to focus on civil resistance as the most promising means of opposing entrenched authoritarian regimes. The use of various forms of unofficial exchange of information, including by samizdat, expanded. Two major revolutions during the 1980s strongly influenced political movements that followed. The first was the 1986 People Power Revolution, in the Philippines from which the term 'people power' came to be widely used, especially in Hispanic and Asian nations. Three years later, the Revolutions of 1989 that ousted communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc reinforced the concept (with the notable exception of the notoriously bloody Romanian Revolution), beginning with the victory of Solidarity in that year's Polish legislative elections. The Revolutions of 1989 provided the template for the so-called color revolutions in mainly post-communist states, which tended to use a color or flower as a symbol, somewhat in the manner of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn December 1989, inspired by the anti-communist revolutions in Eastern Europe, the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) organized popular street protests and hunger strikes against the communist regime. In 1990, dissidents in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic started civil resistance against the government, but were initially crushed by Red Army in the Black January massacre.\n\nRecent nonviolent revolutions include the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which was highlighted by a series of acts of civil disobedience, sit-ins, and general strikes organized by the opposition movement.\n\nThe beginnings of the nonviolence movement lie in the satyagraha philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, who guided the people of India to independence from Britain. Despite the violence of the Partition of India following independence, and numerous revolutionary uprisings which were not under Gandhi's control, India's independence was achieved through legal processes after a period of national resistance rather than through a military revolution.\n\nAccording to the socialist Fourth International, Karl Marx acknowledged a theoretical possibility of \"peaceful\" revolutions, but the Fourth International articles also say \"The development and preservation of good relations with the military forces is one of the absolute priorities of preparatory revolutionary work\". Some have argued that a nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces, like in the relatively nonviolent\nPortuguese Carnation Revolution.\n\nA peaceful revolution or bloodless coup is an overthrow of a government that occurs without violence. If the revolutionists refuse to use violence, it is known as a nonviolent revolution. If the revolutionists are willing to use force, but the loyalists (government) negotiate or surrender to divert armed conflict, it is called a bloodless war.\n\nPeaceful revolutions that have occurred are the Bloodless Revolution (also known as the Glorious Revolution) of 1688 in United Kingdom, the People Power Revolution of 1986 in the Philippines, and the peaceful revolution of 1989 in Germany.\n\nOne theory of democracy is that its main purpose is to allow peaceful revolutions. The idea is that majorities voting in elections approximate the result of a coup. In 1962, John F. Kennedy famously said, \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\"\n\nGeorge Lakey in his 1973 book and in his 1976 \"A Manifesto for Nonviolent Revolution\", laid out a five-stage strategy for nonviolent revolution.\n\nStage 1 – Cultural Preparation or \"Conscientization\": Education, training and consciousness raising of why there is a need for a nonviolent revolution and how to conduct a nonviolent revolution.\n\nStage 2 – Building Organizations: As training, education and consciousness raising continues, the need to form organizations. Affinity groups or nonviolent revolutionary groups are organized to provide support, maintain nonviolent discipline, organize and train other people into similar affinity groups and networks.\n\nStage 3 – Confrontation: Organized and sustained campaigns of picketing, strikes, sit-ins, marches, boycotts, die-ins, blockades to disrupt business as usual in institutions and government. By putting one's body on the line nonviolently the rising movement stops the normal gears of government and business.\n\nStage 4 – Mass Non Cooperation: Similar affinity groups and networks of affinity groups around the country and world, engage in similar actions to disrupt business as usual.\n\nStage 5 – Developing Parallel Institutions to take over functions and services of government and commerce. In order to create a new society without violence, oppression, environmental destruction, discrimination and one that is environmentally sustainable, nonviolent, democratic, equitable, tolerant, and fair, alternative organizations and structures including businesses must be created to provide the needed services and goods that citizens of a society need.\n\nGene Sharp, who influenced many in the Arab Spring revolutions, has documented and described over 198 different methods of nonviolent action that nonviolent revolutionaries might use in struggle. He argues that no government or institution can rule without the consent of the governed or oppressed as that is the source of nonviolent power. Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. argued this as well.\n\n\n\n\nThese are revolutions in post-communist authoritarian Europe and other new countries that were part of the former Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact. Each of these had massive street protests and/or followed disputed elections and led to the resignation or overthrow of leaders considered by their opponents to be authoritarian. Almost all of them used a particular colour or a flower to be their symbol of unity.\n\n\nThe media attention given to the color revolutions has inspired movements in the Middle East, and their supporters, to adopt similar symbology.\n\n\nDrawing inspiration from the People Power Revolution of 1986 in the Philippines, as well as other succeeding color revolution movements, several South American countries experienced what were effectively non-violent revolutions.\n\n\nSeveral countries are experiencing the rise of non-violent resistance movements with the intent of effecting a non-violent revolution.\nThe Sudanese Revolution was a major shift of political power in Sudan that started with protests throughout the streets on 19 December 2018[25] and continued with sustained civil disobedience for about eight months, during which the 11 April 2019 Sudanese coup d'état deposed President Omar al-Bashir after thirty years in power, the 3 June Khartoum massacre took place under the leadership of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) that replaced al-Bashir, and in July and August 2019 the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (FFC) signed a Political Agreement and a Draft Constitutional Declaration legally defining a planned 39-month phase of transitional state institutions and procedures to return Sudan to a civilian democracy.[16][14][15] In August and September 2019, the TMC formally transferred executive power to a mixed military–civilian collective head of state, the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, and to a civilian prime minister (Abdalla Hamdok) and a mostly civilian cabinet, while judicial power was apparently (according to Sudan Daily and Khartoum Star) transferred to Nemat Abdullah Khair, Sudan's first female Chief Justice.[18][19] This article mainly covers this eight-month period. See Terminology below for debates on the definition of the \"Sudanese Revolution\", which may also be interpreted to include the period during the prime ministership of Abdalla Hamdok, who promised that the transitional period would carry out \"the program\" of the revolution\n\nInspired by the regional Arab Spring, protests started in Bahrain on February 14. The government responded harshly, killing four protesters camping in Pearl Roundabout. Later, protesters were allowed to reoccupy the roundabout where they staged large marches amounting to 150,000 participants.\n\nOn March 14, Saudi-led GCC forces were requested by the government and entered the country, which the opposition called an \"occupation\". The following day state of emergency was declared and protests paused after a brutal crackdown was launched against protesters including doctors and bloggers. More than 2,929 people have been arrested, and at least five people died due to torture while in police custody.\n\nProtests resumed after lifting emergency law on June 1, several large rallies were staged by the opposition parties including a march on March 9, 2012 attended by over 100,000. Smaller-scale protests and clashes outside of the capital have continued to occur almost daily. More than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising.\n\nThere have been a number of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, with participation from student group Zubr. The most recent major protests were on March 25, 2005. This was a self-declared attempt to emulate the Kyrgyzstan revolution, and involved over a thousand citizens. However, it was severely suppressed by the police which arrested over 30 people.\n\nMikhail Marinich, a leader of the opposition, is currently in prison. The opposition uses as a symbol the white-red-white former flag of Belarus. The movement has had significant connections with that in neighboring Ukraine, and during the Orange Revolution some white-red-white flags were seen being waved in Kiev.\n\nLukashenko has said in the past: \"In our country, there will be no pink or orange, or even banana revolution.\" More recently he's said \"They [the West] think that Belarus is ready for some 'orange' or, what is a rather frightening option, 'blue' or 'cornflower blue' revolution. Such 'blue' revolutions are the last thing we need\". On April 19, 2005, he further commented: \"All these coloured revolutions are pure and simple banditry.\"\n\nThe 2007 Georgian demonstrations against the government of president Mikheil Saakashvili. The demonstrations peaked on November 2, 2007, when 50,000–100,000 rallied in downtown Tbilisi, capital of Georgia. Protests were organized by the National Council, an ad-hoc coalition of ten opposition parties, and financed by the media tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili. Demonstrations were initially largely peaceful, but turned violent the next day when the police used heavy-handed tactics, including tear gas and water cannon.\n\nThe opposition in Moldova, is reported to have hoped and urged for some kind of Orange revolution, similar to that in Ukraine, in the followup of the 2005 Moldovan parliamentary elections, while the Christian Democratic People's Party adopted orange for its color in a clear reference to the events of Ukraine.\n\nA name hypothesized for such an event was \"grape revolution\" because of the abundance of vineyards in the country; however, such a revolution failed to materialize after the governmental victory in the elections. Many reasons have been given for this, including a fractured opposition and that the government had already co-opted many of the political positions that might have united the opposition (such as a perceived pro-European and anti-Russian stance). Also, the elections themselves were declared fairer in the OSCE election monitoring reports than had been the case in other countries where similar revolutions occurred, even though the CIS monitoring mission strongly condemned them.\n\nOn March 25, 2005, activists wearing yellow scarves held protests in the capital city of Ulan Bator, disputing the results of the 2004 Mongolian parliamentary elections and calling for fresh elections. One of the chants heard in that protest was \"Let's congratulate our Kyrgyz brothers for their revolutionary spirit. Let's free Mongolia of corruption.\"\n\nThe Occupy movement is an international protest movement which started in New York City on September 17, 2011 with Occupy Wall Street and uses the occupation of public spaces without government permission as a means of protesting numerous issues, including notably social and economic inequality. By October 9 Occupy protests had taken place or were ongoing in over 95 cities across 82 countries and over 600 communities in the U.S. As of October 28 the Meetup page \"Occupy Together\" listed \"Occupy\" communities in 2,355 towns and cities worldwide.\n\nInitiated by the Canadian activist group Adbusters, the movement is partly inspired by the Arab Spring movement, especially Cairo's Tahrir Square protests, and the Spanish Indignants. Occupy protests take their name from Occupy Wall Street, and commonly use the slogan \"We are the 99%\", the #Occupy hashtag format, and organize through websites such as \"Occupy Together\" (website no longer being maintained). The protests, which have been described as a \"democratic awakening,\" are difficult to distill to a few demands, and have included protests against the Federal Reserve and clashes with local police over the right to camp out in public spaces.\n\nThere has been longstanding opposition to President Islam Karimov, from liberals and Islamists. The revolution in neighboring Kyrgyzstan began in the largely ethnic Uzbek south, and received early support in the city of Osh. Nigora Hidoyatova, leader of the Free Peasants opposition party, has referred to the idea of a farmers' revolution. She also said that her party is collaborating with the youth organization Shiddat, and that she hopes it can evolve to an organization similar to Kmara or Pora.\n\nSeveral violent or nonviolent protests in the early 21st century, especially the ones Tunisia and Egypt, have been termed \"Social Media Revolutions\", alluding to the role played by Web 2.0 communications technologies in massive mobilization.\n\nDespite an initial ban on the use of the internet, once it was lifted social media was used quite extensively in coordinating the masses in marching to key government locations. On February 11, 2011, President Hosni Mubarak resigned as president of Egypt, leading people to label this as a peaceful and mostly non-violent people's revolution where, except in a limited number of incidents, loss of life was caused directly by acts of the government rather than protesters.\n\n\n"}

The seat was then held for Labour by a local activist Teresa Pearce, who defeated the Conservatives candidate Colin Bloom, a councillor for Bickley Ward in Bromley.\n\nPearce increased her majority in the 2015 general election to rank 125th of the party's 232 MPs then elected.\n\nIn April 2009, an investigation took place into the tampering of ballot boxes and abuse of the postal vote system used for the selection of the prospective Labour candidate for Erith and Thamesmead.

The Conservatives' strongest wards are in the Bexley part of the seat, in particular Northumberland Heath Ward. The remaining wards from Bexley and Greenwich have traditionally seen more support for the Labour Party, in both local and national elections. There is a significant demographic divide within the seat, with Northumberland Heath being over 85% white, and Truth and Belvedere are also predominantly white. However, Thamesmead and Plumstead have much more diverse populations, where no single ethnic group has more than half of the population.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in South London, and as a consequence of changes to ward boundaries, the Boundary Commission for England recommended that parts of Glyndon ward and Colyers ward be transferred from Erith and Thamesmead to the constituencies of Greenwich and Woolwich and Bexleyheath and Crayford respectively; that part of Plumstead ward be transferred to Erith and Thamesmead from Eltham; and that parts of Lesnes Abbey ward, Nothumberland Heath ward and Erith ward be transferred to Erith and Thamesmead from Bexleyheath and Crayford.\n\n \n\n\n"}

It features independent MacPherson struts suspension at the front and a twist-beam rear suspension. The water-cooled MeMZ-245 I4 engine was a major shift forward from the air-cooled V4 used in former models.\n\nThe 1102 acquired the Tavria name in 1989. It was chosen in an internal factory contest and resembles \"Tauric\", the ancient Greek name of Crimea.\n\nZAZ-1102 Tavria Nova started production in 1999.\n\nZAZ-1103 Slavuta was a 5-door B-class liftback released in 1995 and discontinued in 2011. It featured a fuel injection engine of 1,2-1,3 liters. Due to the use of a liftback type body with an elongated roof line and rounded contours of hood and trunk lid, the movement of turn indicators onto the headlamp assemblies (increased rounding radius from 20 to 50 mm) and the removal of rain gutters from above the doors, not only was a completely new shape of created, but also the aerodynamics were improved, the luggage compartment volume increased, the loading height lowered (by 60 cm), and the dirtying of the rear glass in rainy weather was decreased. When ZAZ started the production of Chevrolet Lanos, some design elements of Chevrolet Lanos (such as seat and door parts) were added to Slavuta.\n\nDuring the period of production more than 140 000 cars were produced. In January 2011 the last car of ZAZ-1103 \"Slavuta\" model was produced by ZAZ line, and it was sold during an online auction on February 11, 2011 for 47,020 hryvnias. ZAZ Forza became the direct descendant of Slavuta on the line. \"ZAZ-Slavuta\" and \"ZAZ-Tavria\" family were the last wholly Ukrainian cars.\n\nIn 2004 the Slavuta was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program.\n\nZAZ-1105 Dana, a 5-door wagon version was released in 1992 and discontinued in 1999. Since 1996, a commercial van has been made. The latest version uses updated MeMZ-301 engines with fuel injection. Compared to the standard \"Tavria\" it had improved aerodynamics.\n\nZAZ-11055 Tavria Pick-Up is a commercial vehicle designed for small cargo transportation. In contrast to the passenger models, the pickup has a fiberglass cargo compartment and plastic upper cover. The Tavria Pick-Up has a body 20 cm longer than the passenger model.\n\n\"Tavria Pick-Up\" is designated for cargo transportation, and its front support beam is made of thicker metal than in hatchback (3.2 mm instead of 2.8 mm). It was powered by a MeMZ-310 engine (1.1-1.3 liters).\n\n\"Tavria Pick-Up\" behaves well on uneven road due to the reinforced structure of rear suspension. It is more rigid compared to the passenger hatchback. This also increased the vehicle's carrying capacity to 420 kg.\nThe fiberglass cargo compartment is rigidly screwed to body. It measures 1250 mm high and 1300 mm wide. The length of cargo is 1320 mm, but it is possible to open the upper rear hatch, which is supported by pneumatic struts to transport longer items.\nThe large area of the rear hatches of tail gate perfectly suits small traders. As such the car can be used as mobile trading stall. The lower part of the hatch can be opened to create a 'counter'.\n\nProducers positioned Tavria as an economy-class car. It was sold in Chile as the Lada Tavria in the early 1990s, and in Colombia between 1992 and 1995. The 3-door hatchbacks were sold in Argentina from 1992 to 1995.\n\nIn 1989 the USSR Ministry of Automobile industry released a promotional video targeting the Western market, which won the Cannes Bronze Lion for trade ads.\n"}

The Mongol tribe called the Manghits constituted a core of the Nogay Horde.\n\nIn the 13th century, the leader of the Golden Horde, Nogay Khan a direct descendant of Genghis Khan through Jochi, formed an army of the Manghits joined by numerous Turkic tribes. A century later the Nogays were led by Edigu, a commander of Manghit paternal origin and Jochid maternal origin, who founded the Nogay dynasty.\n\nIn 1557 the Nogay \"Nur-al-Din\" Qazi Mirza quarreled with Ismael Beg and founded the Lesser Nogai Horde on the steppe of the North Caucasus. The Nogays north of the Caspian were thereafter called the Great Nogay Horde. In the early 17th century, the Horde broke down further under the onslaught of the Kalmyks.\n\nThe Nogays north of the Black Sea were nominally subject to the Crimean Khanate rather than the Nogay Bey. They were divided into the following groups: Budjak (from the Danube to the Dniester), Yedisan (from the Dniester to the Bug), Jamboyluk (Bug to Crimea), Yedickul (north of Crimea) and Kuban. In particular, the Yedisans are mentioned as a distinct group, and in various locations.\n\nThere were two groups of Nogays: those north of the Caspian Sea under their own Bey (leader), and those north of the Black Sea nominally subject to the Crimean Khan. The first group was broken up circa 1632 by the Kalmyks. The second shared the fate of the Khanate of Crimea.\n\nThe Nogay language was a form of Kypchak Turkic, the same language group as that of the neighboring Kazakhs, Bashkirs and Crimean and Kazan Tatars. Their religion was Muslim, but religious institutions were weakly developed.\n\nThey were pastoral nomads grazing sheep, horses, and camels. Outside goods were obtained by trade (mostly horses and slaves), raiding, and tribute. There were some subject peasants along the Yaik river. One of the main sources of income for the Nogays was raiding for slaves, who were sold in Crimea and Bukhara. Hunting, fishing, caravan taxation, and seasonal agricultural migration also played a role although it is poorly documented.\n\nThe basic social unit was the semi-autonomous \"ulus\" or band. Aristocrats were called \"mirza\". The ruler of the Nogays was the Bey. The capital or winter camp was at Saraychik, a caravan town on the lower Yaik. From 1537 the second in rank was the \"Nur-al-Din\", usually the Bey's son or younger brother and expected successor. The \"Nur-al-Din\" held the right bank along the Volga. From the 1560s there was a second \"Nur-al-Din\", a sort of a war chief. Third in rank was the \"Keikuvat\", who held the Emba.\n\nPolitical organization was fluid and much depended on personal prestige since as nomads, the Nogay subjects could simply move away from a leader who was disliked. Ambassadors and merchants were regularly beaten and robbed. Stealing horses, looked down upon in many cultures, was an important part of social and economic life on the steppe. Beys and Mirzas would often declare themselves vassals of some outside power, but such declarations had little meaning.\n\nThe Nogay Horde along with the Crimean Khanate raided settlements in Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, and Poland. The slaves were captured in southern Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia, and Circassia by Tatar horsemen in a trade known as the \"harvesting of the steppe\". In Podolia alone, about one-third of all the villages were destroyed or abandoned between 1578 and 1583. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.\n\n\nThis data is from the English-language sources below. A long list of Nogay raids on Russia and Poland, from Russian sources, can be found at Crimean-Nogai Raids.\n\nDuring the next 150 years, Black Sea grain ports assist massive southward expansion of Russian agriculture and population.\n\n\n\n"}

S. Bushnell—was purchased by the Navy at New York City from C. S. Bushnell on 27 July 1861; was fitted out for naval service at the New York Navy Yard and was commissioned there on 19 September 1861, Lt. Reed Werden in command.\n\nAssigned to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, \"Stars and Stripes\" reached Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 September. Two days later, she was ordered to tow schooners of the Stone Fleet to Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina. She arrived off Hatteras Inlet on 1 October and operated in that vicinity for the next few months. While there, the , , and were subordinate to the orders of her captain. Because of the draft of the \"Stars and Stripes\" and the \"Underwriter\", Lt. Werden was unwilling to have them enter Pamlico Sound due to shallowness of Hatteras Inlet. On 2 November, a Confederate vessel engaged the \"Stars and Stripes\" at long range briefly before retiring. The exchange was ineffectual since neither ship came within range of the other's guns. On 5 and 6 November, the ships under Lt. Werden's command attempted to provide assistance to the French corvette \"Prony\" which had run aground, but between concern for the weather and Rebel activity, proved unable to do so. On 15 December, she captured schooner \"Charity\" and sent her to New York City for adjudication.\nOn 7 February 1862, the screw gunboat was in the squadron which attacked Roanoke Island and the next day captured that base which controlled communication between Pamlico Sound and Albemarle Sound. On 20 February while transferring ammunition to the , that ship struck the submerged anchor of the and was sunk, with most of her crew brought aboard the \"Stars and Stripes\". She operated in the inland waters of North Carolina and helped capture New Bern, North Carolina, in mid-March.\n\"Stars and Stripes\" returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 June for repairs and sailed on the evening of the 10th for blockading duty off Wilmington, North Carolina. Shortly before dawn on the 27th, she helped destroy blockade-running steamer \"Modem Greece\" which that Union blockader had run aground. On 24 August, \"Stars and Stripes\" captured British ship \"Mary Elizabeth\" attempting to slip into Wilmington with a cargo of salt and fruit.\n\nThe wear and tear of hard duty forced \"Stars and Stripes\" to sail, via Norfolk, Virginia, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for repairs. She was decommissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 14 September.\n\nQuickly restored to a serviceable condition, the ship was recommissioned on 29 September and was assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. The steamer reached Key West, Florida, and spent the remainder of the Civil War operating off the gulf coast of Florida. \n\nHighlights of her service in 1863 included capturing sloop \"Florida\" at St. Marks Bay, Florida, laden with cotton and tar on 3 June; the expedition of boat crews from the steamer and to Marsh Island, Florida, to destroy salt and salt works on 15 July; and the destruction under heavy fire of blockade-running schooner \"Caroline Gertrude\" aground on the bar at the mouth of the Ochlockonee River on 29 December. \n\nIn 1864, she captured blockade-running steamer \"Laura\" off the Ochlockonee on 18 January; she destroyed an extensive Confederate fishery at Marsh Island on 19 and 20 October and captured the troops stationed there as guards; and she joined three other gunboats in an expedition on 3 December which destroyed extensive salt works at Rocky Point in Tampa Bay.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, \"Stars and Stripes\" sailed north and was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 30 June 1865. She was sold at public auction there on 10 August 1865 to Thomas Watson and Sons of New York City.\n\n\"Stars and Stripes\" was redocumented on 18 September 1865 as \"Metropolis\". The ship operated in merchant service until, while steaming from Philadelphia to Pará, Brazil, she was wrecked on the outer bar of Currituck Beach, North Carolina, on the evening of 31 January 1878. Both the ship and her cargo were a total loss. 85 persons lost their lives.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826845", "title": "Bitterroot River", "text": "Bitterroot River\n\nThe Bitterroot River is a northward flowing river running through the Bitterroot Valley, from the confluence of its West and East forks near Conner in southern Ravalli County to its confluence with the Clark Fork River near Missoula in Missoula County, in western Montana. The Clark Fork River is tributary to the Columbia River and ultimately, the Pacific Ocean. The Bitterroot River is a Blue Ribbon trout fishery with a healthy population of native westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. It is the third most fly fished river in Montana behind the Madison and Big Horn Rivers.\n\nThe Bitterroot River is named for the bitterroot plant \"Lewisia rediviva\", whose fleshy taproot was an important food source for Native Americans. The Salish called the river Spet-lum for \"Place of the bitterroot\" and In-shi-ttogh-tae-tkhu for \"Willow River\". French trappers knew the plant as racine amère (bitter root). The early Jesuit priest, Father De Smet, named it St. Mary's River. By the time of Washington Territory surveys by Governor Isaac I. Stevens in 1853, the name had been translated to Bitterroot River.\n\nThe Bitterroot River watershed drains in Ravalli and Missoula counties. The Bitterroot Valley averages 7–10 miles wide and is uniquely low gradient for western Montana streams. The river mainstem begins at the confluence of the East Fork Bitterroot River and the West Fork Bitterroot River. From there the mainstem receives numerous tributaries from the Bitterroot Mountains to the west and the Sapphire Mountains to the east. The watershed is a snowmelt dominated system with large interannual variations in streamflow and peak flows from mid-May to mid-June. The variation is compounded by extensive irrigation withdrawals and upstream reservoir storage at Painted Rocks Reservoir on the West Fork Bitterroot River with the most severely dewatered reaches along of the river located between Woodside Crossing near Corvallis and Bell Crossing near Stevensville.\n\nMajor tributaries include Skalkaho Creek, and Lolo Creek. The Skalkaho Creek drainage subwatershed originates in the Sapphire Mountains and drains and flows west-northwest to it confluence with the Bitterroot River. Lolo Creek is the primary tributary in the northern portion of the Bitterroot watershed. Lolo Creek is often completely dewatered in late summer in its lower due to withdrawals for irrigation and rural water use.\n\nAlthough the Bitterroot River passes close by to many residential areas, it is an excellent place for wildlife viewing. Many species of ducks and waterfowl are common along with osprey, bald eagles and heron. Elk (\"Cervus canadensis\"), moose (\"Alces alces\"), and both white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\") and mule deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus\") frequent the river as a source of water and to graze near its banks. The most notable wildlife viewing locale along the river is the famous Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge, named for U.S. Senator Lee Metcalf, a pioneer of the conservation movement.\n\nA renowned fly fishing stream, the Bitterroot River mainstem and many of its tributaries are important migratory corridors and spawning habitat for native westslope cutthroat trout (\"Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi\") and bull trout (\"Salvelinus confluentus\"). Other native fish include mountain whitefish (\"Prosopium williamsoni\"), longnose sucker (\"Catostomus catostomus\"), slimy sculpin (\"Cottus cognatus\"), and longnose dace (\"Rhinichthys cataractae\").\n\nRainbow trout (\"Oncorhynchus mykiss\") and brown trout (\"Salmo trutta\") are popular gamefish but are not native to the Bitterroot River watershed and pose significant threats to native trout. In Montana, rainbow trout are only native to the upper Kootenai River in the state's extreme northwest corner. Non-native rainbow trout pose one of the greatest threats to cutthroat trout by hybridization, producing \"cutbows\". In addition, non-native brook trout (\"Salvelinus fontinalis\") often displace native cutthroat trout and bull trout in small streams.\n\nThe towns along the Bitterroot River, including Hamilton, Stevensville, Missoula, and Darby are popular destinations for fly fishing, with rainbow trout being fairly prevalent and with smaller populations of brown trout and westslope cutthroat trout. The Bitterroot is a Class I river from the confluence of the East and West forks to its confluence with the Clark Fork River for public access for recreational purposes.\n\n\n\n"}

Based in Anaheim, California the corps was a charter member corps of Drum Corps International (DCI) and the first DCI World Champion.\n\nThe Kingsmen had their origins in the Anaheim Explorer Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps, founded by Don Porter in 1958. Practicing on military installations, the corps and its members adopted a very military style, even when out of uniform. In 1963, the Explorer Scouts corps split into two new corps, the Kingsmen and the Velvet Knights.\n\nBy the late 1960s the corps, nicknamed \"The Blue Machine\" was touring nationally and became a contender for major national titles in the early '70's. The corps at this time was financially sound, having a strong parents' support group and corporate sponsorship from Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, and the Anaheim Angels. In late 1971, the Kingmen became a founding member of Drum Corps International. However, 1972 got off to a rocky start, when founder Don Porter suddenly resigned as director. With rumors of the corps' demise spreading around the country, the corps reorganized under interim directors Don Wells and Don Linscott. Starting late, the corps spent six weeks of hard work to put their show together before departing on their national tour. The corps won both the U.S. Open in Marion, Ohio and the CYO Nationals in Boston before arriving in Whitewater, Wisconsin for the inaugural DCI World Championships. The Kingsmen placed third in the preliminary competition, behind Santa Clara Vanguard and Blue Stars, but vaulted past both corps in Finals to win the first-ever DCI title.\n\n1972 was the Kingsmen's finest hour, but their success was part of the cause of the corps' downfall. Practicing hard to make up for their late start, the corps missed out on numerous opportunities to play for pay. This, combined with the expense of staying at a motel before Finals and the loss of Don Porter's financial abilities put the corps into financial distress. They continued to challenge in DCI for only two more years, finishing 6th in 1973, and 3rd in 1974, before the corps went inactive in 1975 to try to reorganize its finances. After their return to the field in 1976, the Kingsmen were no longer a contender, touring and attending DCI for only three years before again going inactive, this time for four years. The corps returned to DCI competition from 1982 to 1986, but never placed higher than 28th. The corps then restricted itself to local West Coast performances in Class A60, with some success, but, after losing their drum line to another corps and their fully loaded equipment trailer to thieves, the Kingsmen left the field after the 1988 season.\n\nThe Kingsmen organization relocated to Stanton in 1989 and reorganized their bingo operation, which continued to raise money for the group for at least another dozen years. They purchased a building in Garden Grove for use as a corps hall. The Kingsmen continued to sponsor percussion ensembles and winter guards for competition in Winter Guard International during the 1990s. In 2002, the Kingsmen sponsored a small brass and percussion group named Starcorps with the intent of it being the startup for a return of the Kingsmen. To date, the group is still trying to raise funds to return the corps to the field.\n\nThe 286 member Kingsmen Alumni Corps returned the Kingsmen name to the field in 2007, making several appearances, including a performance at the DCI Semi-Finals at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on August 10.\n\nThe Kingsmen Drum and Bugle Corps is sponsored by Kingsmen Starcorps Inc., a 501 (c)(3) musical organization that has a Board of Directors to carry out the organization's mission. The Chairman of the board is Tim Benge.\n\nSource:\n\n"}
{"id": "1826856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826856", "title": "Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)", "text": "Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)\n\n\"Make It Happen\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. Written and produced by Carey and C+C Music Factory's David Cole and Robert Clivillés, it was released on April 4, 1992, by Columbia Records as the third and final single from her second studio album, \"Emotions\" (1991). The pop-, R&B-, and dance-influenced track incorporates traces of gospel in its bridge and crescendo. Described by author Chris Nickson as Carey's most personal and inspirational song (up until \"Hero\"), it tells of her personal struggles prior to her rise to fame, and how her faith in God helped sustain her.\n\nThe song was praised by music critics, many of whom applauded Carey's incorporation of several musical genres, as well as the song's personalized lyrical content. Aside from its critical acceptance, \"Make It Happen\" was successful in the United States, but charted weakly internationally compared to her previous singles. It peaked at number 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and finished at number 42 on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Year-End Chart. The song reached number 7 in Canada and the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Australia, but did not reach the top 50 in the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nThe song's music video was filmed in a cathedral-like church. A benefit event inside, titled \"Save Our Church\", features Carey as the main performer, leading a choir in song as she sings to the constant cheering and applause of the crowd. Aside from the video's message of prayer and religion, the video features men and women of different backgrounds. Carey included the song on the set lists of all of her concert tours throughout her career, and the track was included on her compilation albums \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), \"Playlist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey\" (2010), and \"The Essential Mariah Carey\" (2012).\n\nAs a child, Carey lived with her mother Patricia in a small apartment on Long Island, New York. They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs. As a result, Carey frequently transferred into different schools, and at the age of seventeen, she moved into a small Manhattan studio with other young women to pursue a career in music. She had already begun working on her demo tape with Ben Margulies, a classmate at her school in Huntington, Long Island. During this period, she lived a lifestyle of poverty, often sharing a box of spaghetti with her five roommates and wearing torn shoes. She held several jobs, while juggling school, writing, and recording music.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Carey invested more time into her music while working sporadically at different jobs. She began working for Puerto Rican singer Brenda K. Starr as a background singer, hoping to find new opportunities and meet important record executives along the way. At a gala for Sony executives, Starr gave a copy of Carey's demo tape to Tommy Mottola, CEO of Columbia Records. Mottola was sufficiently impressed with the tape to sign Carey to the label. Two years later in 1991, Carey was well under way writing and recording material for her second studio album, \"Emotions\" (1991). During the months spent conceptualizing the album, Carey decided to write a song that would illustrate her lifestyle prior to her success. She felt listeners' hearing her rags-to-riches story might inspire them to pursue their dreams. As a result, Carey wrote what was described by author Chris Nickson as her \"most inspirational song\" (up until \"Hero\"), titled \"Make It Happen\".\n\nFollowing the success of her self-titled debut album, Carey desired to pen her personal struggles prior to her signing with Columbia. She hoped to give her fans an idea of what her life was like two years prior and to instill relief or inspiration in them. In the song, Carey sings \"Not more than three short years ago / I was abandoned and alone / Without a penny to my name / So very young and so afraid / No proper shoes upon my feet / Sometimes I couldn't even eat / I often cried myself to sleep.\" Later in the song, Carey sings \"But still I had to keep on going / I struggled and I prayed / And finally found my way,\" retelling how her faith helped guide her until her career blossomed and expressing to listeners the importance of finding and connecting with God. Author Chris Nickson wrote the following regarding the song, its lyrics and composition:\n\nThat wasn't just a faith in herself and her talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know that no matter what they were doing, no matter how difficult things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a little more to gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.\n\n\"Make It Happen\" is a dance track that draws influence from pop, R&B, gospel, and dance-pop genres; its tempo is 108 beats per minute. The song was written and produced by Carey and C+C Music Factory's David Cole and Robert Clivillés, and it was released as the third and final single from her second studio album, \"Emotions\". It employs several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar, bass, organ, and tambourine. Additionally, Carey incorporated a church choir into the track's bridge, which, according to Nickson, helped the song become even more of an anthem. The song is set in common time and is composed in the key of D minor. Carey's vocal range spans from the low-note of C to the high-note of G, while the song's chorus follows a chord progression of G–G–G/F–Em–G/D–C–G/B–Am.\n\n\"Make It Happen\" has received acclaim from music critics, many of whom complimented its uplifting lyrical content. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine named the song one of his top two picks from \"Emotions\", while Jon Pareles from \"The New York Times\" called it an \"uplifting pop-gospel homily\". Steve Morse of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote: \"[Its] positive message also soars through a gospel rearrangement. After hearing it, we understand why [Carey named] gospel star Shirley Caesar ... such a strong influence\". In a different review of the album, Morse called \"Make It Happen\" \"glorious\" and described it as \"a clear slice of spiritual autobiography\". In a review for Carey's \"Greatest Hits\" in December 2001, Devon Powers from PopMatters called the song's lyrics \"power through prayer\" and described some of its vocals as having \"churchy overtones\". Rob Tannenbaum from \"Rolling Stone\" described the track as \"a teary tale of how she kept her religious faith despite hard times\", while complimenting its \"overheated [vocal] growling.\" \"Chicago Tribune\" editor Jan DeKnock called it \"upbeat\" and \"inspirational\", while Mellisa A. Jacque from the \"St. Petersburg Times\" wrote \"Carey evokes a deep-felt strength and love for life, and the music has a jazzy feel in its sparsity\". \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Michael Corcoran called it a \"so-so composition\" and described it as a \"zombie dance-pop\" production, though he said the song was salvaged by Carey's \"stunning vocals\".\n\nCarey, Cole, Clivillés and Sony Music Entertainment were sued in June 1994 by songwriter Kevin McCord, who accused the party of incorporating significant musical elements from his 1979 song, \"I Want to Thank You\", into \"Make It Happen\". McCord said, \"If you listen to the chords at the beginning of the song, the similarity is obvious. It's the exact same chords in a different key\"; he also noted lyrical similarities. Carey's side initially claimed McCord had no standing to sue, but McCord's attorney showed the song's copyright owners had transferred their legal interest in \"I Want to Thank You\" to McCord \"in an effort to adjudicate their claims\". Though a Carey spokesperson maintained the copyright infringement allegations were false, McCord said he had turned down settlement offers from Carey's camp. McCord eventually accepted a settlement offer of about US$500,000.\n\nCarey's debut album sold over 15 million copies globally and produced four chart-topping singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Although \"Emotions\" became Carey's fifth chart-topping single in the US, sales for the album, \"Emotions\", stalled. As sales of \"Emotions\" continued to plummet, Columbia released \"Make It Happen\" as the third worldwide single from the album. Following a strong promotional boost for the song, it only peaked at number 5 on the Hot 100, becoming Carey's lowest charting US single to that point. It remained in the top 40 for 16 weeks and was ranked at number 42 on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 1992 Year-End Chart. On the February 22, 1992, issue of \"RPM\", \"Make It Happen\" debuted at number 97 on the Canadian singles chart. On May 16, the song reached its peak position of number 7, staying in the singles chart for 19 weeks.\n\nThe song's charting throughout Australia and Europe was weak in comparison to Carey's previous singles (the single was not released in New Zealand, despite Carey's popularity in that country at the time). On the May 10, 1992, Australian Singles Chart, \"Make It Happen\" debuted at number 45. The following week, it rose to its peak of number 35, and spent five weeks within the chart. Similarly, in the Netherlands, the song attained a peak of 59 and spent only five weeks in the Dutch Top 100. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 20 on the week ending April 18, 1992. The following week, the song rose three spots to its peak position and charted for five weeks. \"Make It Happen\" was awarded a BMI Pop Award in 1992.\n\nThe music video for \"Make It Happen\" was directed by Marcus Nispel and features Carey performing at a closing church. Alisa Reyes, best known from Nickelodeon's \"All That\" appears on stage with Mariah. A benefit being depicted within, titled \"Save Our Church\", involves several other churchgoers who have congregated there to raise money through song. As the video begins, inspectors enter the building, searching the premises prior to its closing. Soon after, however, Carey makes her way to the stage with a few background singers and is soon joined inside the edifice by swarming groups of religious individuals. As she begins playing the song, an additional choir forms on the small stage with several small children on the upper tiers. Several musicians enter the room as the video progresses.\n\nTowards the video's climax, the crowd cheers Carey and begin clapping and chanting praises. Nispel said he added additional raw sounds, such as cheers, praises, and shouts, into the video in order make it feel like a \"real, live experience\". In his biography of Carey, Nickson noted the inclusion of men, women, and children of different races and ages: \"The video tried to incorporate and further the song's image of religious belief and racial equality. The audience, as they filled into the dusty and deserted building, was made up of the widest cross section possible: old and young (with a strong emphasis on the children), abled and disabled, all races and color.\"\n\nCarey has performed \"Make It Happen\" on live television, during charity appearances, and on numerous concert tours. Her first live performance of the song was an acoustic version on the television show \"MTV Unplugged\" in 1992, which was later released on the EP entitled \"MTV Unplugged\" (1992). Carey's performance was recorded on March 16, 1992, at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured several musicians, back-up vocalists, and a crew of ten just for the filming and recording. The show was directed by Larry Jordan, who had previously worked with Carey on the music video set for \"Someday\". Nickson felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals:\n\nThe roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.\nCarey performed \"Make It Happen\" at an intimate concert at Proctor Theatre in New York on July 15, 1993. The concert was released as the home video \"Here Is Mariah Carey\" (1993). At the VH1 Divas taping in 1998, Carey was the opening performer of the event, and after \"My All\", her single at the time, she followed with \"Make It Happen\". As during the usual live performances of the song, a gospel choir accompanied her. On July 2, 2005, a benefit concert was held in Hyde Park, London, titled Live 8. The televised event was watched by over 9.6 million Britons and attended by over 200,000. Carey performed a three-song set list, opening with \"Make It Happen\" followed by \"Hero\" and \"We Belong Together\", featuring a live choir of African children during the first two songs. On April 12, 2005, Carey performed the song as part of a three-song concert for \"Good Morning America\", drawing the biggest crowd in Times Square since December 2004. Following a live rendition of \"It's Like That\" with Jermaine Dupri, Carey was joined on stage by several male and female vocalists, all wearing white gowns and serving as a gospel choir. Similarly, on October 2, 2009, Carey played a four-song set list at Rockefeller Center for a taping of \"The Today Show\". \"Make It Happen\" was performed with a church choir and children's quartet.\n\nAside from the televised appearances and charity events, \"Make It Happen\" was featured on the set lists of several of Carey's world tours. The song was routinely performed on the Music Box Tour and the Daydream World Tour in 1993 and early-mid 1996, respectively. During her first show at Japan's Tokyo Dome on March 7, 1996, Carey performed the song alongside a twenty-five person choir and several additional musicians and background vocalists. \"Make It Happen\" was featured on Carey's Butterfly World Tour in early 1998, during which she was joined on stage by several choir members and musicians. Similarly, two years later, the song was placed as the ninth song on the set list during select dates of her Rainbow World Tour. Similar set-ups were featured for her following Charmbracelet World Tour and The Adventures of Mimi Tour, where church choirs were brought out for the song, in addition to additional background vocalists and musicians. In the Angels Advocate Tour, the song served as a dancer's interlude; Carey entered during the bridge of the song. On September 26, 2010, during the song's performance in a show in Singapore for that tour, Carey slipped on stage, and the small slip was blamed on Carey's US$10,000 heels. She asked her assistant to remove them and completed the concert barefoot.

Various war crimes have been alleged, but have received comparatively little historical attention.\nAlthough the Empire of Japan did not sign the Geneva Conventions, which have provided the standard definition of war crimes since 1864, the crimes committed fall under other aspects of international and Japanese law. For example, many of the alleged crimes committed by Japanese personnel broke Japanese military law, and were not subject to court martial, as required by that law. Japan also violated signed international agreements, including provisions of the Treaty of Versailles such as a ban on the use of chemical weapons, and the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907), which protect prisoners of war (POWs). The Japanese government also signed the Kellogg–Briand Pact (1929), thereby rendering its actions in 1937-45 liable to charges of crimes against peace, a charge that was introduced at the Tokyo Trials to prosecute \"Class A\" war criminals. \"Class B\" war criminals were those found guilty of war crimes \"per se\", and \"Class C\" war criminals were those guilty of crimes against humanity. The Japanese government also accepted the terms set by the Potsdam Declaration (1945) after the end of the war. The declaration alluded, in Article 10, to two kinds of war crime: one was the violation of international laws, such as the abuse of prisoners of war; the other was obstructing \"democratic tendencies among the Japanese people\" and civil liberties within Japan. \n\nIn Japan, the term \"Japanese war crimes\" generally only refers to cases tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, also known as the \"Tokyo Trials\", following the end of the Pacific War. However, the tribunal did not prosecute war crimes allegations involving mid-ranking officers or more junior personnel. Those were dealt with separately in trials held in China and in the Soviet Union after the surrender of Japan.\n\nRevisionist historians have contested that such crimes occurred. Far-right nationalist groups in Japan have denied war crimes as \"anti-Japanese propaganda\" to place modern Japan in a negative light for political purposes.\n\nSpecial Japanese military units conducted experiments on civilians and POWs in Manchukuo. One of the most infamous was Unit 731. Victims were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, and were used to test biological weapons, among other experiments.\n\nBetween 3,000 and 12,000 men, women, and children died during human experimentation conducted by Unit 731.\n\nAccording to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, Emperor Hirohito authorized the use of chemical weapons in China. Furthermore, \"tens of thousands, and perhaps as many 200,000, Chinese died of bubonic plague, cholera, anthrax and other diseases\", resulting from the use of biological warfare. Although owing to systematic Japanese destruction of records, there is no record of chemical or biological weapons in Manchukuo itself, these weapons of mass destruction were partly researched, produced, and stockpiled in Manchukuo by the Kwantung Army.\n\nThe Japanese military's use of forced labor also caused many deaths. According to a joint study of historians Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyochi Himeta, Toru Kubo and Mark Peattie, more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilized for forced labor in Manchukuo under the supervision of the Kōa-in.\n\nForced laborers were often assigned work in dangerous conditions without adequate safety precautions. The world's deadliest mine disaster, at Benxihu Colliery, occurred in Manchukuo.\n\n\nIn 2007, an article by Reiji Yoshida in the Japan Times argued that the Japanese investments in Manchukuo were partly financed by selling drugs. According to the article, a document claimed to have been found by Yoshida directly implicated the Kōa-in in providing funds to drug dealers in China for the benefit of the puppet governments of Manchukuo, Nanjing and Mongolia. This document corroborates evidence analyzed earlier by the Tokyo tribunal which stated that\n\nIn late 1949, numerous members of the former Kwantung Army who had been captured in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria were convicted in connection with the activities of Unit 731, and related units for their connections with crimes against humanity and the use of chemical and biological weapons.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East convicted a number of high Japanese officials in connection with the invasion of Manchuria, establishment of Manchukuo and with conspiracy to wage aggressive war against China. Those sentenced to death with strong connections to Manchukuo included senior officers in the Kwantung Army Hideki Tōjō, Akira Mutō, Seishirō Itagaki and Kenji Doihara.\n\n\n"}

Prior to becoming an actor, he had a successful career as a professional wrestler as well as an enforcer for the Colombo family.\n\nMontana was born in Brooklyn, New York City on March 13, 1926. He is of Italian-American heritage. He was fluent in both English and Italian. His wrestling career began in neighboring New Jersey in 1953. He wrestled under the Zebra Kid gimmick, and was billed at the height of 6 foot 6 inches. It wasn't long before Montana found success. Along with Golden Terror, he won the New Jersey Tag Team titles on April 4, 1953. Montana began to travel, wrestling in the Midwest. He soon won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship, defeating Dave Sims on October 1, 1953 in Kansas City. However he lost the title on December 11, 1953 to Sonny Myers, who had previously held the title three times before defeating the Zebra Kid. Montana's final success of the 1950s came in 1956, winning the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship with Gene Kiniski, defeating Herb Freeman and Ray Gunkel on September 18 in Dallas under the alias Len Crosby. He also worked as a bouncer during this time to earn extra money.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Montana was on the road with the Carnival Circuit as a wrestler. As a popular wrestler on the circuit, Montana met the then unknown Eddie Sharkey in 1960. The two struck up a friendship. After seeing what Sharkey could do, Montana recommended that he try his hand at professional wrestling. Montana also clued in Sharkey on the then-unacknowledged truth about professional wrestling--that all the outcomes are predetermined. Later that year, Montana won the NWA Texas World Tag Team titles with Joe Christie, under the Len Crosby name. Then with Hard Boiled Haggerty, he won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on October 4, 1960, defeating Stan Kowalski and Tiny Mills (wrestling as Murder Inc.) in Minneapolis. But in a match against Verne Gagne, Montana suffered a broken leg, forcing Haggerty to choose a new partner. After recovering from his injury, in 1961 Montana began to wrestle in Florida. He came to the Tampa Bay area and began to wrestle under The Zebra Kid alias. At his great size, he would often pin his opponents in under one minute. The Zebra Kid had a notable feud with Eddie Graham; their battles sold out Fort Homer Hesterly Armory many Tuesday nights in 1961. Things came to a head when Montana defeated Eddie Graham in a NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Georgia version) title match on May 1, 1962. On November 23, 1962, he won the NWA (Georgia) Southern Tag Team Titles with his partner Gypsy Joe, defeating 'Grizzly' Jake Smith and Luke Brown. Montana then went on to form a powerful partnership with Tarzan Tyler, in which they would win three titles. First, the NWA International Tag Team Titles on April 9, 1963 defeating Ted Evans and Chief Little Eagle, then again winning the NWA International Tag Team Titles later in June 1963, defeating billed champions Chief Little Eagle and Dick Steinborn. Finally, the duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in Georgia, during October 1963, they defeated Karl Von Brauner and Kurt Von Brauner. Montana was due to be Gorilla Monsoon's tag team partner in 1964, but at the last minute Monsoon took on The African Savage as his partner instead. Montana had been interested in actingband was meeting with casting agents in Los Angeles at the same time he was due to team up with Bison. Montana began to wrestle less and less, and went into semi-retirement; however he appeared in matches up until his acting career took off in the early 1970s.\n\nMontana became involved with the Colombo crime family in the late 1960s. Tall and very heavily built, his talents were mostly as an enforcer and an arsonist. He would tie a tampon to the tail of a mouse, dip it in kerosene, light it, and let the mouse run through a building, or he would put a lighted candle in front of a cuckoo clock so that when the clock's bird would pop out the candle would be knocked over and start a fire. Eventually, Montana was jailed at Riker's Island. Upon being released, Montana acted as a bodyguard for many senior members of the Colombo Family.\n\nThe filming of \"The Godfather\" faced strong opposition from the Italian-American Civil Rights League, with disputes headed by Joe Colombo and Frank Sinatra threatening its whole production. Producer Al Ruddy eventually made a deal with the league and Joe Colombo to cut the word Mafia from the script, and the league would back the production of the film. This meant many mobsters would be present on the set of \"The Godfather\". It was in 1971, when Montana was acting as a bodyguard for a senior Colombo Family member, that he met Francis Ford Coppola and Al Ruddy. After being introduced to the 6-foot-6, 320-pound Montana, they quickly cast him for the role of Luca Brasi. When Bettye McCartt, Al Ruddy's assistant, broke her watch, Montana offered to get her a new one. A week later, Montana returned with a \"gift from the boys\" – an antique diamond watch. He was picked for the part after the original actor playing the character died of a stroke. This would be his first film appearance. His role was that of mob enforcer Luca Brasi, a hitman used by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). Montana was very nervous about appearing opposite Brando. Director Coppola incorporated this real-life tension into several scenes, showing Brasi repeatedly practising (and later fumbling) his congratulations to Corleone. Montana had little screen time in the film, but his notable height and physique caught the eye of producers, and he appeared in several movies and television programs after appearing in \"The Godfather\".\n\nOne of the first of these roles was the Italian spoof film \"The Funny Face of the Godfather\" in 1973. Montana had the role of Saro, and an artist's rendition of Montana appeared on the film's poster. He established himself as an efficient character actor and appeared in \"Patty\" (1976), \"Fingers\" (1978) as the pizzeria owner Luchino, \"Matilda\" (1978), \"They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way\" (1978), \"The Jerk\" (1979), \"Seven\" (1979), \"Below the Belt\" (1980), \"Defiance\" (1980), \"Battle Creek Brawl\" (1980) alongside Jackie Chan, \"Evilspeak\" (1981), \"...All the Marbles\" (1981), \"Pandemonium\" (1982) and \"Blood Song\" (1982). He also acted on television as well as the big screen, appearing in \"Search\" (1973), \"Strike Force\" (1975), which starred a young Richard Gere, \"Contract on Cherry Street\" (1977), which featured Frank Sinatra, \"Kojak\" (1978), and \"Magnum, P.I.\" (1982). Montana was usually cast as \"muscle\" for hire or an intimidating mobster.\n\nMontana retired from acting after appearing in the B movie \"Blood Song\" (1982), which he also co-wrote. He died May 12, 1992 of a heart attack in Lindenhurst, New York. He was 66 years old. His likeness was used as his character Luca Brasi in \"The Godfather Game\". Terence McGovern provided the voice acting.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1999, prior to that year's general elections, and started off with a number of notable politicians that left the ruling SWAPO party. This includes Ulenga who left SWAPO to protest plans to amend the constitution so that President Sam Nujoma could run for a third term.\n\nUlenga contested the 1999 presidential election. He came second behind Nujoma and received 10.5% of the vote. In the parliamentary elections the CoD gained seven seats. Besides Ulenga, Rosa Namises was one of the CoD parliamentarians in this legislative period.\n\nIn the parliamentary election held on 15 and 16 November 2004, the party won 7.2% of popular votes and five out of 78 seats, making it the second-largest party behind SWAPO.\n\nIn the 2009 general election, the Congress plummeted to eighth place in both presidential and assembly votes, receiving less than one percent of all votes; whereas the All People's Party ran sixth in both contests. Congress lost all but one of its five former seats in the Assembly, and joined the APP (which took one seat) in being tied for fifth through ninth place among parties in the Assembly.\n\nThe CoD held an extraordinary party congress at Keetmanshoop in May 2008, and Ulenga was re-elected as CoD President; he defeated Ignatius Shixwameni by 14 votes, and Shixwameni, rejecting the outcome, left the congress in protest along with about half of the delegates. Shixwameni alleged rigging and claimed that his CoD faction represented the majority of the party; his faction went to the High Court to press these claims. On December 16, 2008, Shixwameni and 21 of his supporters announced their resignations from the CoD, but the faction led by Ulenga said that Shixwameni's resignation was invalid because he and five other party members had already been expelled on August 11, 2007. The Ulenga faction accused Shixwameni of \"revolt[ing] against the party and its democratically elected leadership by organising illegitimate parallel national structures against CoD structures, and by attempting to usurp the national leadership of the party\" following his defeat at the May 2008 congress. The Ulenga faction also said in December 2007 that it was suing Shixwameni and Nora Schimming-Chase to seek the return of about 260,000 Namibian dollars belonging to the party, which, according to the Ulenga faction, Shixwameni and Schiming-Chase had diverted and spent. In late 2007, Shimwameni's group formed a new party, the All People's Party.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, the High Court nullified the May 2007 congress and ruled that the CoD members expelled in August 2007 had to be allowed back into the party. The court also ordered that a new congress be held within five months. Ulenga accepted this decision. Schimming-Chase, who had previously been Vice-President of the CoD, returned to her post as a result of the High Court's decision, but she was not allowed to resume her other previously held post of Chief Whip. In early August, the CoD's National Executive Committee set the date of the new congress as October 24–26.\n\n"}
{"id": "1826870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826870", "title": "Popular Democratic Movement", "text": "Popular Democratic Movement\n\nThe Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), formerly the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), is an amalgamation of political parties in Namibia, registered as one singular party for representation purposes. In coalition with the United Democratic Front, it formed the official opposition in Parliament until the parliamentary elections in 2009. The party currently holds five seats in the Namibian National Assembly and one seat in the Namibian National Council and is the official opposition. McHenry Venaani is president of the PDM.\n\nThe PDM is an associate member of the International Democrat Union, a transnational grouping of national political parties generally identified with political conservatism, and a member of the Democrat Union of Africa, which was relaunched in Accra, Ghana in February 2019. The president of the party, McHenry Venaani, is the current chairperson of the Democrat Union of Africa.\n\nThe party was formed as the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) in November 1977 as a result of the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference held in Windhoek from 1975 to 1977 as a counterbalance and main opposition to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Participants of the Constitutional Conference walked out of the Constitutional Committee over the National Party's insistence on retaining apartheid legislation in the new constitution. Both the conference and DTA were named after the Turnhalle building (German for old Turners hall) in Windhoek where the conference was held.\n\nThe DTA won the 1978 South West African legislative election by a landslide, claiming 41 of the 50 seats. This was largely due to \"widespread intimidation\" and the presence of South African troops, particularly in the north of the territory. The subsequent interim government, consisting of a National Assembly and a Council of Ministers, lasted until 18 January 1983 when, due to continued interference by the South African Administrator-General the Council of Ministers resigned. On 18 January 1983 South Africa accepted the dissolution of both the legislative and the executive body without elections being scheduled, and again assumed full administrative authority over South West Africa. This void lasted until 17 June 1985 when the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGNU) was installed by the South African Administrator-General. Its legislative and executive actions were subject to South African approval, with newly appointed administrator-general Louis Pienaar having the veto right on all legislation to be passed. The TGNU was widely perceived as a largely powerless body that sought moderate reform but was unable to secure recognition by the United Nations.\n\nThe DTA dominated this government, too, albeit not with absolute majority: In the 62-seat National Assembly the DTA occupied 22, and five smaller parties got 8 seats each. On 1 March 1989 TGNU was suspended along the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 for it to give way to an independent government, determined by the November 1989 parliamentary elections. SWAPO won the elections, the DTA came distant second.\n\nAfter Namibian independence the DTA lost several of its former affiliates. The Republican Party, the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO), and the Action for Democratic Change all left the alliance in 2003, citing various grievances. The DTA's past affiliation with the apartheid government before Namibian independence continues to affect its public image. \n\nOn 4 November 2017, days after its 40th anniversary, the party was renamed the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) in order to facilitate modernisation and to shed its \"colonial\" name.\n\nThe party did well in 2019 election, scoring 16.65% (their best performance since 1989) and winning 16 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nUpon its foundation, Clemens Kapuuo became the first president of the party, and Dirk Mudge served as chairman. After Kapuuo's assassination in 1978 Cornelius Ndjoba became president on 3 July. The position of the vice-president was established on that day with Ben Africa as first incumbent.\n\nMishake Muyongo led the party through the early years of independence, and in the 1994 presidential election he placed second, behind President Sam Nujoma, with 23.08% of the vote. After Muyongo expressed support for Caprivi secession in 1998, he and the party he represented in the alliance, the United Democratic Party, was suspended from the DTA in August 1998 at an extraordinary meeting of the party's executive committee. Muyongo fled Namibia and was replaced as DTA President by Katuutire Kaura, who called for Muyongo to be brought back and put on trial. Kaura served for three elective terms. In September 2013, he was defeated by McHenry Venaani.\n\nThe following parties participated at the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference and subsequently formed the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance:\n\n\n"}

Its roots are in the Damara Council, an administrative body for the Damaraland territory in South West Africa that in 1980 became a political party.

There was mutual distrust between SKAT and the newly elected leftist Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP). Several SKAT members (usually referred to as volunteers) abandoned their posts, took their arms, and retreated to a wooded area near Kaunas in July and August 1993. The crisis escalated when the government issued an order for the volunteers to secure their weapons at designated locations in September. Interpreting the order as confiscation of their weapons, a total of about 150 armed men gathered near . They expressed their mistrust and dissatisfaction with the new LDDP government and raised social and political demands. After a week long negotiations, the men agreed to return to their posts if no one would be persecuted for their role in the coup. \n\nAlthough it concluded peacefully, the stand-off is one of the most controversial and little understood episodes in the early years of post-Soviet Lithuania. Sociologist evaluated the events as a \"stress test\" of the Lithuanian democracy and the new relationship between the anti-communist and ex-communist elites. The anti-communists, which were now in opposition, did not use the opportunity to return to power. The stand-off was followed by two related and unsolved bombings of the Bražuolė railway bridge in November 1994 (no casualties) and of a passenger car in January 1997 (SKAT officer Juras Abromavičius was killed). The events remain controversial and subject to numerous theories and conspiracies. The political right accuses Russian secret services, while political left points to the conservatives.\n\nLithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990. At that time, the Soviet Red Army was in full control of Lithuania and Lithuanians started organizing informal paramilitary volunteer groups to protect and defend the new government. The Soviet Union responded to the declaration of independence by imposing an economic blockade and later by using military force in the events of January 1991. The volunteers as well as unarmed civilians played an important role in defending institutions of the Lithuanian government. The Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces (SKAT) was officially established on 17 January 1991, a few days after the January events. In October–November 1992, the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP), the former Communist Party of Lithuania, won a majority in the country's first post-independence elections. At the time, Lithuania's regular military was still very weak and Russian troops were still stationed in the country. The volunteers were seen as disloyal to the new leftist government. One of the versions of the events blames LDDP and its policies – distrusting SKAT, the new government reduced its funding, did not provide uniforms, ordered to surrender weapons (many of which were purchased by the volunteers from personal funds), etc. thus provoking the volunteers into action.\n\nOn 31 July 1993, SKAT officer Jonas Maskvytis gathered his weapons that he had personally purchased from the retreating Russian Army and left Kaunas to nearby forests. He later explained that he was helping an acquaintance who was defrauded by a group of criminals who trafficked in counterfeit Deutsche Marks. Maskvytis fired at a car with the criminals and corrupt police officers. Upon learning that he would likely be arrested and that he was dismissed by the Minister of National Defence Audrius Butkevičius, Maskvytis decided not to give in and retreat to the forests. He was accompanied by three men and soon joined by others. They took over a homestead of professor in . \n\nThe crisis escalated after the government issued an order to collect weapons from SKAT units on 14 September. Because Minister Butkevičius was away in Turkey, the order was signed by his deputy Gediminas Pulokas. While the Russian Army was present in Lithuania, the volunteers kept their weapons so that they could respond almost instantly to a threat. When the last convoy of Russian troops left Lithuania on 31 August, the government ordered the weapons secured and kept in depots. The volunteers protested taking of their weapons and Maskvytis was joined by company commander Alvydas Pangonis and his men on 16 September. The men, now numbering about 150, expressed their dissatisfaction with the new LDDP government and President Algirdas Brazauskas and raised social and political demands. The men also claimed to have the support of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. In 2007, Brazauskas publicly claimed that the volunteers planned his assassination and wrote in his memoirs that some of the demands were typed on Seimas computers and sent via Seimas fax machines. The government first responded on 17 September with an order from the Armed Forces Staff to surrender the weapons or face consequences for anti-government actions.\n\nThe coup took place during the withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania and the visit of Pope John Paul I on 4–8 September (one of the volunteers fired in the air during the pope's public appearance in Kaunas). Comparisons were also drawn with the unsuccessful attempt to disarm mutinous paramilitary forces by President Abulfaz Elchibey of Azerbaijan in June 1993. The government decided to seek a peaceful resolution and negotiated with the volunteers. The agreement was reached on 22 September when a special parliamentary commission led by visited the camp and promised not to prosecute any of the volunteers for their role in the coup. The government reserved the right to prosecute volunteers who had otherwise committed criminal acts. When the volunteers returned to Kaunas, they captured the SKAT headquarters in Kaunas and disarmed commander Juras Abromavičius, who retreated to the Seventh Fort of Kaunas Fortress. Abromavičius then alerted his superiors, newly appointed SKAT commander Arvydas Pocius, via the M-1 radio station and Lithuanian National Radio and Television, but reportedly was ordered not to escalate the situation. The men were found in violation of the SKAT statute and faced disciplinary actions, including removal from offices and reshuffling of SKAT leadership. Minister of Defense Butkevičius resigned and was replaced by Linas Antanas Linkevičius on 22 October 1993 (with the effective date of 28 October).\n\nOn 30 October 1993, the volunteers shot and killed a 16-year old Žaneta Sadauskaitė who lived nearby and became friendly with the men. There is no definite version of her death, but likely she was shot in the forehead by accident (one version claims that the men put a tin on her head and used it as a target practice). Haroldas \"Haris\" Valaitis confessed to the murder, but was acquitted of the murder charges as the judge believed he confessed to protect others because he had a history of mental illness and likely would not serve time in jail and would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. No others were charged in Sadauskaitė's death. \n\nMaskvytis and another officer were tried for their pre-coup activities (taking actions that exceeded their official duties) and received a two-year suspended sentence in December 1994. In October 2000, Maskvytis was sentenced to four years in prison for the possession and trafficking of illegal weapons, explosive materials, and ammunition. During the search of Maskvytis' home, the police found seven grenades, AK-47, Luger pistol, hunting riffle IZH, etc. \n\nThe coup was followed by several controversial high-profile crimes that remain unsolved. On 6 November 1994, the Bražuolė bridge bombing damaged a bridge over the on the Vilnius–Kaunas Railway, but train derailment and casualties were avoided due to lucky coincidence. The prosecutor's office investigated 12 different scenarios for the explosion but stopped the pre-trial investigation in 2012 due to the expired statute of limitations. A report of the investigation published in 2015 claimed that the bombing was related to an attempt to disrupt Russian military transport to the Kaliningrad Oblast and send a message of support to Chechnya in its armed struggle for independence from Russia. Juras Abromavičius, officer of SKAT and State Security Department of Lithuania (VSD), who was investigating the coup of 1993 and explosion of 1994 was assassinated on 31 January 1997 when a homemade RDX bomb detonated under his car. In 2006, the prosecutor's office announced that it closed Abromavičius's case. They managed to identify Vladas Grybauskas as the bomb maker but he committed suicide on 10 December 1997. The statute of limitations for the murder of Abromavičius expired in 2017. These cases were followed by a string of deaths ruled as suicides: volunteers Remigijus Kuršas fell from a third floor, Irmantas Ruplys, Edmundas Simanavičius, and Remigijus Kazokaitis shot themselves. Kornelijus Rudauskas drowned in summer 1997. \n\nThere are many theories and conspiracies surrounding the events. Already during the crisis, politicians expressed views that it was not an action of a few disgruntled officers, but a premeditated political provocation. In general, the two most popular versions blame either the Russian Federal Security Service or Lithuanian ultra-conservatives. For example, former Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas once said that the coup was useful to Russia as it could demonstrate that as soon as the Russian Army left Lithuania, the country experienced internal unrest. During an interview on 20 September 1993, Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the conservative Homeland Union, expressed fears that the incident could be used as a pretext for the Russian Army to return but at the same time defended SKAT as a necessary institution for the national defense. The political left accuse the conservatives, primarily the Homeland Union. A parliamentary commission in 2007 to investigate Abromavičius' murder concluded that the murder was carried out by a terrorist-like group that maintained contacts with current and former leaders of the Homeland Union, Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, and Lithuanian Democratic Party. In 2018, Audrius Butkevičius and Zigmas Vaišvila publicly and explicitly accused Landsbergis of sponsoring terrorist activities related to the coup and the two bombings.\n\n"}

The party's president is Esther Muinjangue.\n\nNUDO was founded by Mburumba Kerina, Clemens Kapuuo, and Hosea Kutako in September 1965 at the suggestion of the Herero Chief’s Council. It was thus, at that time, an organisation that had mainly Herero followers. At the 1975-1977 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference, several ethnically based parties agreed to join the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance to form one joint opposition to SWAPO which at that time had turned the struggle for Namibian independence into a guerrilla war.\n\nNUDO remained part of the DTA until it withdrew in September 2003, accusing the DTA of failing to work for Herero interests. The party then held a congress in January 2004.\n\nEsther Utjiua Muinjangue became the party’s first elected female president and the first elected female leader of a Namibian political party when she defeated the Okakarara constituency councillor, Vetaruhe Kandorozu, at the party’s third elective congress, which took place on 25-26 March 2019. At the elective congress, which was held in Windhoek, Peter Kazongominja was elected vice president and Joseph Kauandenge was elected secretary-general of the party. Muinjangue defeated the councillor by 240 to 227 votes.\n\nIn the parliamentary election held on 15 and 16 November 2004, the party won 4.1% of popular votes and 3 out of 78 seats. Herero Chief Kuaima Riruako, the President of NUDO, was its candidate in the concurrent presidential election, placing fourth with 4.23% of the national vote. NUDO president Kuaima Riruako died on 2 June 2014, and was succeeded by Asser Mbai. in the 2014 National Assembly elections NUDO won 2 seats which went to president Asser Mbai and secretary-general Meundju Jahanika.\n"}

It was revived as an independent party in 2003, and won 1.9% of popular votes and 1 National Assembly seat. \n\nThe Republican Party was founded by Dirk Mudge in 1977 and joined the DTA in the same year. In mid-2003, the Republican Party revived itself as an independent organization. Hardap Region Governor Pieter Boltman resigned as party leader, opposing the party's moves to separate itself from the DTA, in July 2003, and he was succeeded by Henk Mudge, Dirk Mudge's son. DTA President Katuutire Kaura denounced the moves to separate the Republican Party from the DTA, saying that Mudge acted unilaterally and illegally. Kaura claimed that Mudge wanted to create a party solely for \"previously advantaged\" minority Namibians, but Mudge denied that the Republican Party would be a party exclusively for whites.\n\nMudge stood as the Republican Party's candidate in the November 2004 presidential election, receiving 1.95% of the vote and placing sixth. Mudge stood again for the Presidency in the 2009 election, where he gained 9,425 votes (1.16%), finishing seventh overall. He was re-elected as the party's leader to the National Assembly.\n\nIn September 2010, the Republican Party was reported to have begun the process of merging with the Rally for Democracy and Progress, the country's largest opposition party. Henk Mudge then announced that he would resign from Parliament on 14 October 2010 and confirmed the disbanding of the Republican Party. In the event he did not resign as a National Assembly member and party president until March 2011. Teacher and party chairperson Clara Gowases was appointed in his place and gave her initial speech to the National Assembly in April of that year. According to a later interview with Mudge, some Republican Party members were elected to local councils with RDP support at this time.\n\nThe merger plan was apparently revived in 2013\nand again early in 2014. During the 2014 presidential election, Mudge initially urged party members to vote for Hage Geingob of SWAPO, before deciding to stand as a candidate. He received 8,676 votes (0.97%) and finished fifth of nine candidates. In the concurrent parliamentary elections, the party received 6,099 votes and 1 seat.

From 1966, he worked for Komsomol and subsequently from Communist Party. Patiashvili, a nondescript party loyalist, succeeded Eduard Shevardnadze as the First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party in 1985. Under Patiashvili, most of Shevardnadze's initiatives atrophied, and no new policy innovations were undertaken. Patiashvili removed some of Shevardnadze's key appointees, although he could not dismiss his predecessor's many middle-echelon appointees without seriously damaging the party apparatus. By isolating opposition groups, Patiashvili forced reformist leaders into underground organizations and confrontational behavior. By the end of 1988, Georgian national movement became more active, several manifestations and hunger strikes were organized by the so-called informal political organizations. The protesters were brutally dispersed by the Soviet troops on April 9, 1989. Following the April 9 Massacre, the Georgian national liberation movement radicalized and left little chance to a local communist leadership to control the situation in the Republic.

This was intended as a long-term solution, as northwest Oregon has the great majority of Oregon's landlines and cell phones. However, by 2007, 541 was on the brink of exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, particularly in Eugene, Corvallis and Medford.

Franks was injured in the head and internally as well in the automobile accident on November 5, 1960, in Milano in Milam County in East Texas, which resulted in the death of Johnny Horton and the eventual loss of a leg by a third musician, Tommy Tomlinson.\nFranks' contribution to rock and roll music has been recognized by his induction into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Louisiana Hall of Fame, and his induction in 2003 into the Shreveport \"Walk of Stars\" where his feet and hand impressions are in concrete beside other talents, such as Elvis Presley, Terry Bradshaw, Kix Brooks, David Toms, and Franks' longtime friend Claude King. The Walk of Stars is located under the Shreveport side of Texas Street Bridge that spans the Red River to Bossier City.\n\nTillman Franks helped to coin the phrase \"The Magic Circle,\" which he describes in his autobiography as: \"an area 50-miles in radius from downtown Shreveport from which many kinds of music evolved. I was lucky to have lived my life in The Magic Circle.\"\n\nOn July 11, 1996, Shreveport observed \"Tillman Franks Day\", sponsored by KWKH.\n\nA 1940 graduate of Byrd High School, Franks was inducted in 2000 into the Byrd Hall of Fame, along with former Caddo Parish Sheriff Don Hathaway and B. L. \"Buddy\" Shaw, a former Byrd principal and a member of both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature.\n\nFranks' brother, William Derrel \"Billy\" Franks (1926-2016), was the founding pastor of the Oakmont Church of God in the Cedar Grove neighborhood. Billy Franks preached the funeral of Johnny Horton in 1960. Another brother, Edward Ray Franks, Sr. (1923-2014), retired after more than three decades in the United States Marine Corps and later engaged in various patriotic activities and conducted a state-recognized puppet ministry through the First Church of God in El Dorado, Arkansas.\n\nFranks died in the fall of 2006 at the age of eighty-six. His son, the Reverend Watson Franks, preached the funeral. The family is interred at Forest Park West Cemetery in Shreveport.\n\nIn 2019, KEEL Radio recalled Franks as \"a legend that should be remembered [for] all the contributions not only to Shreveport's musical history but to rock and country ... because, sadly, the man's impact far exceeds his legacy ...He wrote great music. He recorded great music (he's associated with more than 50 No. 1 Country hits). He managed great talent. He had a great eye and ear for musical talent. His impact is truly amazing.\"\n\nFranks' out-of-print autobiography entitled \"Tillman Franks: I Was There When It Happened\" is still in demand by his remaining fans.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826924", "title": "Abraham Zacuto", "text": "Abraham Zacuto\n\nAbraham Zacuto (, ; 12 August 1452 – ) was a Spanish astronomer, astrologer, mathematician, rabbi and historian who served as Royal Astronomer to King John II of Portugal. The crater Zagut on the Moon is named after him.\n\nZacuto was born in Salamanca, Spain in 1452. He may have studied and taught astronomy at the University of Salamanca. He later taught astronomy at the universities of Zaragoza and then Cartagena. He was well versed in Jewish Law, and was the rabbi of his community.\n\nWith the general expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Zacuto took refuge in Lisbon, Portugal. Already famous in academic circles, he was invited to court and nominated Royal Astronomer and Historian by King John II of Portugal, a position which he held until the early reign of Manuel I. He was consulted by the king on the possibility of a sea route to India, a project which he supported and encouraged. Zacuto would be one of the few who managed to flee Portugal during the forced conversions and prohibitions of departure that Manuel I enacted, in order to keep the Jews in Portugal as nominal Christians for foreign policy reasons (see Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal). He fled first to Tunis, and later moved to Jerusalem. He died probably in 1515 in Jerusalem, however, other reports indicate his final home was the Hebrew community of Damascus and the death occurred in 1520. However, in a similar vein to other giants of the Jewish faith, such as Saadia, Maimonides and the Vilna Gaon, he followed the extremely old Jewish custom (believed to have begun in Babylon) of being buried as close to Jerusalem as possible. Zacuto had established his wish to make his death pilgrimage at a Passover gathering.\n\nZacuto developed a new type of astrolabe, specialized for practical determination of latitude while at sea, in contrast to earlier multipurpose devices intended for use ashore. Abraham Zacuto's principal claim to fame is the great astronomical treatise, written while he was in Salamanca, in Hebrew, with the title \"Ha-ḥibbur ha-gadol\" (\"The Great Book\"), begun around 1470 and completed in 1478. It was composed of 65 detailed astronomical tables (ephemerides), with radix set in year 1473 and the meridian at Salamanca, charting the positions of the Sun, Moon and five planets. The calculations were based on the Alfonsine Tables and the works of earlier astronomers (notably of the 14th-century Majorcan school). Zacuto set out the data in a simple \"almanac\" format, with the positions of a planet easily interpolated between entries, making it quite easy to use.\n\nThe first Castilian translation was undertaken in 1481 by Juan de Salaya. Zacuto's Portuguese disciple Joseph Vizinus (Mestre José Vizinho, the much-valued physician and advisor of John II of Portugal) adapted it into a Latin translation, under the title \"Tabulae tabularum Celestium motuum sive Almanach perpetuum\" (\"Book of Tables on the celestial motions or the Perpetual Almanac\"), immediately along with a new Castilian translation, and arranged for its publication in 1496 by Samuel d'Ortas in Leiria, Portugal. (one of the first books published in Portugal with a movable type printing press).\n\nZacuto's \"Almanach perpetuum\" (or \"Biur luḥot\") helped immediately revolutionize ocean navigation. Prior to the \"Almanach\", navigators seeking to determine their position in the high seas had to correct for \"compass error\" (the deviation of the magnetic north from the true north) by recourse to the quadrant and the Pole Star. But this proved less useful as they approached the equator and the Pole Star began to disappear into the horizon. Zacuto's \"Almanach\" supplied the first accurate table of solar declination, allowing navigators to use the sun instead. As the quadrant could not be used to look directly at the sun, Portuguese navigators began using the astrolabe on board (an old land-based instrument to measure the height of the sun indirectly). Zacuto's tables in conjunction with the new metal nautical astrolabe allowed navigators to take accurate readings anywhere. Already in 1497, Vasco da Gama took Zacuto's tables and the astrolabe with him on the maiden trip to India. It would continue to be used by Portuguese ships thereafter to reach far destinations such as Brazil and India.\n\nVasco da Gama and his crew underwent a thorough briefing and preparation by Zacuto, in addition to learning to use the new instruments which he had developed for their trip before setting on the voyage to India in 1496. Prior to that, Zacuto had again improved on the existing astronomical tables, mostly those prepared under King Alphonso X of Castille. Already Columbus had used Zacuto's tables. The story is that on one of his voyages, when attacked by the natives, Columbus noted that Zacuto had predicted an eclipse for that day, and used this information to threaten the natives and convince them that he could extinguish the Sun and Moon and deprive them of all light. Zacuto's work thus saved the Admiral's life and that of his crew.\n\nIn 1504, while in Tunisia, Abraham Zacuto wrote a history of the Jewish people, \"Sefer yuḥasin\", since the Creation of the World until 1500, and several other astronomical/astrological treatises. The \"History\" was greatly respected and was reprinted in Cracow in 1581, at Amsterdam in 1717, and at Königsberg in 1857, while a complete, uncensored, edition was published by Herschell Filipowski in London at 1857. \n\nAbraham Zacuto might have an uncredited appearance in Luís de Camões's 1572 epic poem, \"The Lusiad\", as the unnamed \"old man of Restelo beach\", a Cassandra-like character that surges forward just before Vasco da Gama's departure to chide the vanity of fame and warn of the travails that await him (Canto IV, v.94-111). This may be Camões' poetic interpretation of an alleged meeting (reported in Gaspar Correia) between Vasco da Gama and the older Abraham Zacuto at a monastery by Belém beach, just before his fleet's departure, in which Zacuto reportedly gave Gama some final navigational tips and warned him of dangers to avoid.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1826936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826936", "title": "There's Got to Be a Way", "text": "There's Got to Be a Way\n\n\"There's Got to Be a Way\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her self-titled debut studio album (1990). Columbia released it as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was one of four songs Carey wrote with Ric Wake during their first recording session together in February 1990, but \"There's Got to Be a Way\" was the only composition to make the final track listing. \n\nIt is a socio-political conscious R&B-pop song which denounces the existence of poverty, racism and war in the world which gradually becomes more aspirational and hopeful as it progresses. The track garnered a mixed reception upon the album's release in 1990: while Carey's vocals were praised, it was seen as too political. An accompanying music video highlights social injustices. The song reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. In May 2020, Carey performed a snippet of the song in a video posted online in response to the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"There's Got to Be a Way\" was composed by Mariah Carey and Ric Wake for Carey's self-titled debut studio album (1990); the lyrics were written by Carey, while she and Wake composed the music. It was written during Carey and Wake's first recording session together. They composed four songs, but only \"There's Got to Be a Way\" was chosen for the final track listing. Co-produced by Wake and Narada Michael Walden, it appears as the second of eleven songs on the track listing. The track was recorded in February 1990 and engineered by Bob Cadway at Cove City Sound Studios and The Power Station, both located in New York City; he was assisted by Dana Jon Chappelle. It was mixed by David Frazer at Tarpan Studios in San Rafael. The keyboards, bass and rhythm engineering was carried out by Louis Biancaniello, while Joe Franco performed the percussion, Vernon \"Ice\" Black played the guitar, and Rich Tancredo also performing on the keyboards. Walter Afanasieff played the synth horns. Carey provided her own background vocals along with Billy T. Scott, Jamiliah Muhammed and The Billy T. Scott Ensemble. The song was released in the United Kingdom as the fifth and final single.\n\n\"There's Got to Be a Way\" is an R&B-pop music song with elements of gospel, lasting for a duration for four minutes and 52 seconds. The song begins with Carey publicly decrying the existence of war, poverty and racism in the world, and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone. A \"peaceful, political anthem,\" the theme of social activism can be heard in the lyrics \"There's got to be a way/ To connect this world today/ Come together to relieve the pain/ There's got to be a way/ To unite this human race/ And together we'll bring on a change.\" Carey goes on to suggest that we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics \"Couldn't we accept each other / Can't we make ourselves aware.\"\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau felt that Carey was being too political in her \"brave, young, idealistic attack\" on war and destitution. Ralph Novak, David Hiltbrand and David Grogan of \"People\" wrote that it is a \"testimony to her talent that she does so much with so little.\" They continued to write that Carey's \"tone and clarity\" makes \"There's Got to Be a Way\" a \"mesmerizing\" track. To mark twenty-five years since the release of \"Mariah Carey\" in June 1990, \"Billboard\" writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track-by-track review of the album in June 2015. He noted that \"There's Got to Be a Way\" follows the same melodic tone as the album's opener \"Vision of Love\" but highlighted their stark lyrical differences, as the former is about social activism and the latter is about love. Although he praised Carey's vocals, writing that she \"deploys\" one of her best whistle notes of her career, he felt that \"the aim for broad appeal comes at the expense of memorable lyrics.\" \n\nSimilarly in December 2015, Kelsey McKinney of the G/O Media owned \"Splinter News\" compiled a selection of reviews of how Carey and her debut album were received in 1990; \"There's Got to be a Way\" was mentioned in Alan Niester's review for the Canadian publication \"The Globe and Mail\". He commented that, as did most critics, Carey's vocals were reminiscent of already established female singers, including Whitney Houston and Lisa Stansfield, with their vocal influences most apparent on the song as well as \"Alone in Love\", specifically. It was because of this, he writes, that despite Carey having a vocal ability that is \"worth watching,\" what she is singing vocally is more interesting than what she is singing lyrically, having not yet found her own style.\n\nThe accompanying music video begins with a shot of an empty street, followed by clips of disadvantaged and poorer members of society going about their daily activities. Two men play dominoes on a wooden crate outside a building, a gang make fun of an elderly man hanging newspapers outside his store and an obese woman walks down the street. Clips of Carey leaning against a wall and sitting on some steps looking on at what is happening are shown. As the first chorus begins, everyone starts to dance joyfully in the street and help those in need. A gospel choir comes out of one of the buildings as the street becomes more crowded with people of all ages and backgrounds rejoicing and getting along with each other. One of the shops in the background has a neon light outside the entrance which says \"Jesus Saves.\"\n\nCarey performed a couple of lines of the song for the first time on May 30, 2020, in response to the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a Black American man, was murdered in the third degree by Derek Chauvin, a White American police officer, in Minneapolis on May 25. The incident occurred after Floyd attempted to make a purchase in a deli using a counterfeit $20 bill, and was arrested and restrained by Chauvin by him placing his right knee across Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, resulting in his death. Carey posted a video clip online, singing the lyrics \"I don't understand how there can be regulated bigotry. There's got to be a way to connect this world today,\" focusing on its lyrics denouncing racism. The singer captioned the video with \"I wrote this song for my first album. Still looking for answers today. We have to make a change. We can't be silent,\" followed by the hashtag Black Lives Matter and an encouragement to her fans to donate to the Color of Change campaign to prohbit the officers involved from working in law enforcement in the future and to be prosecuted for Floyd's death.\n\nEuropean 12\" CD\n\nEuropean Maxi CD\n\nUK Cassette Single\n\nUK Maxi CD\n"}
{"id": "1826940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826940", "title": "Puffery", "text": "Puffery\n\nIn everyday language, puffery refers to exaggerated or false praise. In law, puffery is a promotional statement or claim that expresses subjective rather than objective views, which no \"reasonable person\" would take literally. Puffery serves to \"puff up\" an exaggerated image of what is being described and is especially featured in testimonials. \n\nPuff piece is an idiom for a journalistic form of puffery: an article or story of exaggerating praise that often ignores or downplays opposing viewpoints or evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn a legal context, the term originated in the 1892 English Court of Appeal case \"Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company\", which centred on whether a monetary reimbursement should be paid when an influenza preventive device failed to work. The manufacturers had paid for advertising stating that £100 would be paid in such circumstances then failed to follow this promise. Part of their defence was that such a statement was \"mere puff\" and not meant to be taken seriously. While the defence ultimately lost the case, the principle was confirmed that certain statements made by advertisers that were obviously not made in a serious manner could be exempt from usual rules relating to promises in open contracts.\n\nThe United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) defined puffery as a \"term frequently used to denote the exaggerations reasonably to be expected of a seller as to the degree of quality of his product, the truth or falsity of which cannot be precisely determined.\"\n\nThe FTC stated in 1983 that puffery does not warrant enforcement action by the Commission. In its FTC Policy Statement on Deception, the Commission stated: \"The Commission generally will not pursue cases involving obviously exaggerated or puffing representations, i.e., those that the ordinary consumers do not take seriously.\"\n\nPuff piece is an idiom for a journalistic form of puffery: an article or story of exaggerating praise that often ignores or downplays opposing viewpoints or evidence to the contrary. In some cases, reviews of films, albums, or products (e.g., a new car or television set) may be considered to be \"puff pieces\", due to the actual or perceived bias of the reviewer: a review of a product, film, or event that is written by a sympathetic reviewer or by an individual who has a connection to the product or event in question, either in terms of an employment relationship or other links. For example, a major media conglomerate that owns both print media and record companies may instruct an employee in one of its newspapers to do a review of an album which is being released by the conglomerate's record company.\n\nAlthough some journalists may assert their professional independence and integrity, and insist on producing an unbiased review, in other cases a writer may succumb to the pressure and pen a biased \"puff piece\" which praises the product or event while omitting any discussion of any shortcomings. In some cases, \"puff pieces\" purport to provide a review of the product or event, but instead merely provide \"peacock words\" (\"an amazing recording\"); \"weasel words\" (\"probably one of the most important albums of the 2000s\"; \"Perhaps one of the leading bands of the 2010s\") and tabloid-style filler which is peripheral or irrelevant to assessing the qualities of the product or event (\"during the filming, there were rumours that romantic sparks flew between the two co-leads, who were often seen talking together on the set\").\n\nThe financial relationship between the product company or entertainment firm and the reviewer is not always as obvious as a cash payment. In some cases, a small group of reviewers may be given an exclusive invitation to test-drive a new sports car or see a new film before it is released. This privileged access to the product may lead the reviewer to do a biased review, either out of a sense of obligation, or because of a concern that the failure to produce a \"puff piece\" will lead to the loss of future preview privileges. In some cases, the potential for bias in invitation-only preview sessions is substantially heightened when the reviewers are flown in to the location for the review, given fancy hotel rooms, and provided catered food and drinks during the actual review. The most egregious cases of this situation occur when, instead of inviting the reviewers to the company headquarters or another logical venue, the company gives all-expense paid tickets to Hawaii or Mexico, and holds the preview screening of the film or the product launch there.\n\nA particular use for puff pieces may be in health journalism. Providers of alternative medicine may be unable to make claims due to laws against false advertising, but they may be able to place stories and testimonials with journalists who can write as they wish under press freedom laws. Recruiting health journalists to write puff pieces may be a lucrative way to build the reputation of a product that has no effect.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826958", "title": "Assyrtiko", "text": "Assyrtiko\n\nAssyrtiko or Asyrtiko is a white Greek wine grape indigenous to the island of Santorini. Assyrtiko is widely planted in the arid volcanic-ash-rich soil of Santorini and other Aegean islands, such as Paros. It is also found on other scattered regions of Greece such as Chalkidiki.\n\nOn Santorini, many old vine plantations (over 70 years of age) of Assyrtiko exist, of which many are non-grafted. These plantations have shown resistance to Phylloxera. As the only European grape vine known to be resistant to wine blight, there is speculation that the actual source of this resistance may arise from the volcanic ash in which the vines grow, and not from the vine itself.\n\nThe mineral profile of the grape bodes well for blending and in recent times it has been blended often with Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon and Malagousia. Assyrtiko grapes clusters are large, with transparent yellow-gold skin and juicy flesh. In the volcanic soil of Santorini, there appear to be some unique characteristics that develop in the grape variety, and therefore in the wine. One of these characteristics is that Assyrtiko does not lose its acidity even if it is very ripe. Throughout Greece, the grape is vinified to make a variety of dry and sweet wines, including Vinsanto-like musky and syrup-sweet dessert wines. In Retsina, it is often blended with the less-acidic Savatiano grape.\n\nAssyrtiko is also known under the synonyms Arcytico, Assirtico, Assyrtico, Asurtico, and Asyrtiko.\n\n"}

It was conceived as a story-based contest by filmmaker Sheldon Renan similar in concept to that of Kit Williams' book \"Masquerade\". The puzzle was presented in two formats, one in an elaborate book illustrated by Jean-Francois Podevin and published by Warner Books, and the other a direct-to-video motion picture filmed by Renan and starring Doryan Dean with Elisha Cook, Jr. in a supporting role. Voice-over narration was provided by actor Richard Lynch with music by composer Jesse Frederick. The film was first aired on cable television and subsequently sold on VHS, Capacitance Electronic Disc, and Laserdisc formats by Vestron Video.\n\nDesigned and promoted as a contest, the puzzle asked treasure seekers to solve the rebus contained within the story to find the location of a one kilogram gold horse statuette buried on public land somewhere within the continental United States. The puzzle itself was designed by Paul Hoffman under the pseudonym \"Dr. Crypton\". The first person to solve the puzzle and dig up the horse before the May 26, 1989 deadline would keep the horse and an additional $500,000 USD locked in a safe deposit box to be opened by a key hidden within the statuette. The solution was designed to be obtainable by either reading the book or watching the video, as all puzzle formats were considered exclusive of each other, albeit sharing certain similarities. The rules of the contest were overseen by the independent advertising agency, D.L. Blair.\n\nThe film was set in 1984 and was centered around a girl who's trying to find her horse, and also includes clues that you need to find a hidden somewhere in the US.\n\nAlthough the promoters of the contest claimed the rebus was solvable within the allotted time frame, this did not prove to be the case. The deadline passed without solution, and the prize was later donated to the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America charity. Even though the puzzle deadline had passed, neither Paul Hoffman nor the promoters of the contest publicized the solution, and many enthusiasts continued their attempts at solving it. Seven months later, Nick Boone and Anthony Castaneda, having arrived at what is now called the \"Captain Nemo\" solution to the book, travelled to Tennessee Pass in Colorado and dug up a vial on National Forest Service land near the 10th Mountain Division (United States) military memorial. The vial contained a congratulatory message. To date, other visitors to the area have been unsuccessful in exhuming additional artifacts of the contest.\n\nControversy surrounded the Boone/Castaneda solution, partly because several of the conclusions reached in their solution were considered to defy logic or were not clearly defined by anything within the puzzle materials. Certain comments made by the promoters referencing changes to the actual burial site during the contest's production have led many enthusiasts to believe that those changes caused the puzzle to be unsolvable, and that Boone & Castaneda were guided by the promoters and their results published in order to bring closure to the quest. Litigation by several contest participants has proven fruitless.\n\nAlthough the contest is officially concluded, websites continue to appear proposing new solutions to the puzzle or its elements. To date, no complete solution has been independently verified, and the promoters maintain the \"Captain Nemo\" solution as the official conclusion. Several forums exist where enthusiasts continue to discuss aspects of the puzzle. Based upon comments made by the promoters, rumor continues to circulate among the puzzle-solving community about a second silver horse that was buried in conjunction with an unproduced ColecoVision game. No supporting information has surfaced.\n\n\n"}

IIASA conducts interdisciplinary scientific studies on environmental, economic, technological and social issues in the context of human dimensions of global change. IIASA’s mission is \"to provide insights and guidance to policymakers worldwide by finding solutions to global and universal problems through applied systems analysis in order to improve human and social wellbeing and to protect the environment.\"\n\nIIASA brings its experience of managing international tensions through science to today's global issues. Its multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers have a growing membership, now including the world's four largest economies.\n\nThe institute is currently directed by Albert van Jaarsveld. Nebojsa Nakicenovic is the current Deputy Director General/ Deputy CEO. Past directors have included Howard Raiffa, professor at Harvard's Business School and Kennedy School of Government, Roger Levien, former Vice President for Strategy at Xerox, Leen Hordijk, former Director at the Institute for Environment and Sustainability, Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Ispra, Italy, and Detlof von Winterfeldt, professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nIIASA is a non-governmental institution funded by scientific organizations in its member countries, which currently include: Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, India (Observer), Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the USA, and Vietnam. Funding for the Institute also comes from contracts, grants, and donations from governments, international organizations, academia, business, and individuals.\n\nOn 4October 1972 representatives of the Soviet Union, United States, and 10 other countries from the Eastern and Western blocs met at The Royal Society in London to sign the charter establishing IIASA. It was the culmination of six years’ effort driven forward by both the US President Lyndon Johnson and the USSR Premier Alexei Kosygin. For IIASA it was the beginning of a remarkable project to use scientific cooperation to build bridges across the Cold War divide and to confront growing global problems on a truly international scale. The first scientist had arrived at IIASA in June, 1973.\n\nClearly, success at bridge building and successful science would go hand in hand. But neither was a foregone conclusion. This was the 1970s, and most research organizations focused on national issues. Few encouraged researchers from different countries or disciplines to work together for the greater good.\n\nTo achieve its ambitious research vision, IIASA would have to break down the barriers between nations and disciplines. This it did, building international multidisciplinary teams to confront innumerable global challenges, both long-standing and emerging. For example, a study on water pollution carried out in the 1980s by a team of IIASA chemists, biologists, and economists still forms the basis of modern water policy design in Japan, USA, and the former USSR.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended (in 1991), IIASA’s sponsoring countries could have said “mission accomplished” and disbanded the Institute. IIASA had certainly helped foster mutual understanding among scientists from East and West. But it had also done more than this. IIASA had shown the scientific benefits of bringing together different nationalities and disciplines to work toward common goals. Indeed, this approach has been widely imitated, for example, in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme.\n\nSo instead of closing in the 1990s the Institute broadened its mandate from the East and West to a truly global focus. Today IIASA brings together a wide range of scientific skills to provide science-based insights into critical policy issues in international and national debates on global change.\n\nIIASA research focuses on complex problems that extend beyond a single country or a single discipline.\n\nIn 2010, IIASA launched a new strategic plan for the next ten years, which focuses on three general problem areas: Energy and Climate Change, Food and Water, and Poverty and Equity.\n\nEvery year approximately 200 researchers from over 35 countries research at IIASA. They work on these broader topics within and across 9 research programs: Advanced Systems Analysis, Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases, Ecosystems Services and Management, Energy, Evolution and Ecology, Risk and Resilience, Transitions to New Technologies, Water, and World Population.\n\nMajor Projects\n\nTen IIASA scientists were among the authors of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize).\n\nThe Global Energy Assessment, released in 2012. The report was a result of collaborative and integrated work of over 500 authors, analysts and reviewers worldwide who contributed independent, scientifically based and policy-relevant analysis of current and emerging energy issues and options. The assessment provides a thorough assessment of energy-related issues including sustainable development, including poverty eradication, climate change mitigation, health, energy security and energy access. The entire assessment is available online as a PDF.\n\nThe Water Futures and Solutions: World Water Scenarios initiative, launched in 2012, aims to provide a similarly broad assessment of global water challenges, in much the same scope as the Global Energy Assessment.\n\nIIASA researchers are major contributors to Working Groups II and III of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.\n\nSince 2010, IIASA is also one of the three \"\"pillar institutions\"\" of the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital.\n\n\n"}

He belonged to a bourgeois family of Orléans, where he first attended school before coming to Paris. In Paris he became advocate to the parlement (1347); then John II appointed him master of requests, and in 1351, a year during which he received many other honors, he became bishop of Laon. At the opening of 1354 he was sent with the cardinal of Boulogne, Peter I, Duke of Bourbon, and Jean VI, count of Vendôme, to Mantes to treat with Charles the Bad, king of Navarre, who had caused the constable, Charles d'Espagne, to be assassinated, and from this time dates his connection with this king.\n\nAt the meeting of the estates which opened in Paris in October 1356 le Coq played a leading role and was one of the most outspoken of the orators, especially when petitions were presented to the dauphin Charles, denouncing the bad government of the realm and demanding the banishment of the royal councillors. Soon, however, the credit of the estates having gone down, he withdrew to his diocese, but at the request of the bourgeois of Paris he speedily returned. The king of Navarre had succeeded in escaping from prison and had entered Paris, where his party was in the ascendant; and Robert le Coq became the most powerful person in his council. No one dared to contradict him, and he brought into it whom he pleased. He did not scruple to reveal to the king of Navarre secret deliberations, but his fortune soon turned. He ran great danger at the estates of Compiègne in May 1358, where his dismissal was demanded, and he had to flee to Saint-Denis, where Charles the Bad and Étienne Marcel came to find him. After the death of Marcel, he tried, unsuccessfully, to deliver Laon, his episcopal town, to the king of Navarre, and he was excluded from the amnesty promised in the treaty of Calais (1360) by King John to the partisans of Charles the Bad. His temporalities had been seized, and he was obliged to flee from France. In 1363, thanks to the support of the king of Navarre, he was given the bishopric of Calahorra in the kingdom of Aragon, which he administered until his death in 1373.\n\n"}

Such a process encounters mixed fortunes due to its amateur nature, although self-motivation is a major asset. The value of self-healing lies in its ability to be tailored to the unique experience and requirements of the individual. The process can be helped and accelerated with introspection techniques such as Meditation. \n\nSelf-healing is the ultimate phase of Gestalt Therapy.\n\nSelf-healing may refer to automatic, homeostatic processes of the body that are controlled by physiological mechanisms inherent in the organism. Disorders of the spirit and the absence of faith can be self-healed.\n\nIn a figurative sense, self-healing properties can be ascribed to systems or processes, which by nature or design tend to correct any disturbances brought into them. Such as the regeneration of the skin after a cut or scrape, or of an entire limb. The injured party (the living body) repairs the damaged part by itself.\n\nBeyond the innate restorative capacities of the physical body, there are many factors of psychological nature that can influence self-healing. Hippocrates, considered by many to be the father of medical treatment, observed: \"The physician must be ready, not only to do his duty himself, but also to secure the co-operation of the patient, of the attendants and of externals.\"\n— Hippocrates.\n\nSelf-healing may also be achieved through deliberately applied psychological mechanisms. These approaches may improve the psychological and physical conditions of a person.
