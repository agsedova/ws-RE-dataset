{"id": "1951274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951274", "title": "People Under the Stairs", "text": "People Under the Stairs\n\nPeople Under the Stairs was an American hip hop duo from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2019. Since their inception, the group has consisted solely of Christopher Portugal (Thes One) and Michael Turner (Double K). The group employs a DIY work ethic of sampling, MCing, DJing, and producing all of their output.\n\nDespite difficulties achieving mainstream or chart successes, the group has rejected the idea that they are an \"underground\" group. They have achieved prominence and acclaim, and praise from fellow musicians.\n\nWhile attending high school in Mid-City Los Angeles, group members Thes One and Double K were independently sampling music, creating \"beat tapes\", and DJing local events. Thes One attended Loyola High and was making a name for himself through his production work and his collaboration with a local, short-lived hip hop group, Spiritual Madness. Meanwhile, Double K attended Hamilton High and was a part of the Log Cabin Crew, a hip-hop collective that also included fellow Hamilton High students Murs, Eligh and Scarub (of Living Legends).\n\nDespite never having met, Thes One and Double K developed an unseen rivalry through gossip spread by their friends, and the two were wary of a confrontation. Eventually, they randomly met while looking for sample material in Martin's (a now-defunct record store on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles) and ultimately decided to listen to beat tapes in Thes One's car. The two were impressed by each other's work, and formed a friendship, characterized by a focus on the production of music, and a shared interest in multiple genres of music.\n\nFor the first few months after the two met, Thes One and Double K were primarily interested in creating instrumental hip hop (possibly for other rap artists to use). However, the duo were wary of rappers and backpackers who were more interested in the lyrical side of hip hop and did not understand or have an interest in the music they were creating. Eventually, Thes One and Double K made the decision to rap over their own material out of a desire to keep everything self-contained.\n\nThe group decided to use the name \"People Under the Stairs\" because they felt it represented their music aesthetic. During a time when most other rap artists were forming large crews or collectives and making a lot of guest appearances to help establish themselves, Thes One and Double K wanted to stay out of the spotlight and concentrate on the music, only coming out from \"under the stairs\" to perform before they went back again.\n\nThes One and Double K would occasionally invite other local artists to perform on the tracks that they were producing at home, but with the exception of their friends Smile-Oak (who appeared on People Under the Stairs' first album, \"The Next Step\", and their first compilation album, \"American Men Vol. 1\") and JazMak (who appeared on \"Question in the Form of an Answer\" and joined them on their 2000–2001 world tour), People Under the Stairs has never really come close to having a third member.\n\nThe group's name does not originate from the 1991 Wes Craven film \"The People Under the Stairs\". While the duo have seen the movie and enjoy it, they were not aware of it when conceiving the group. Nor is the group from San Francisco, California, despite the song \"San Francisco Knights\" on their first album; the group wrote the song after a good time in the city.\n\nIn 1998, while Thes One was attending the University of Southern California, People Under the Stairs used Thes One's student loan funds to create, package and release their first 12-inch single, entitled \"The Next Step II\". Nearly 500 copies were pressed, although many copies omitted a b-side, \"Live At The Fishbucket, Pt. 1\", when the record stamper broke half-way through, and a different master had to be used. Just weeks after the 12-inch was released, a large portion of the singles were bought by the shopkeeper of the (now closed) Mr. Bongo record shop. When the owner played the single in the store, it sold out within 7 minutes. In an attempt to get more material from the group, Mr. Bongo's owner contacted the only person he knew in the music business, Chris Smith, the CEO of Om Records in San Francisco, and urged him to get in contact with People Under the Stairs.\n\nIn the meantime, the group had independently released their first album, \"The Next Step\" in 1998. Although they were initially reluctant to create a full-album (being more focused on song production), the group decided to take the chance. The album was recorded on an 8-track ADAT digital recorder, mostly at Thes One's home in Los Angeles, and Thes One and Double K produced and engineered the album entirely by themselves.\n\nWith the aid of a local L.A. producer, DJ Dusk, the duo performed their first live in-store appearance as a group at the Beat Non Stop record store (also now out of business) on Melrose. Despite the assistance from friends, the Los Angeles hip hop community at large was still unwilling to accept or play their music on the radio or at club venues, and to their surprise, the group found a larger fan base overseas in Europe, which was instrumental in their decision to begin their first world tour.\n\nChris Smith and Om Records had taken Mr. Bongo's store owner up on getting in contact with People Under the Stairs and were initially prepared to offer the group a one-song deal for Om's compilation albums, \"Deep Concentration\" and \"Mushroom Jazz\". Om was a music label generally known at the time for electronic music and club music, but Smith, upon hearing more of the duo's material, offered them a four-album deal, which the group accepted in 1999.\n\nIn August 1999, the duo embarked on their first world tour in support of Om's \"Deep Concentration\" project. The tour provided People Under the Stairs with a respite from the impenetrability and apparent disinterest of the Los Angeles music scene's key players. The European leg of the tour evolved into a solo act for People Under the Stairs, with local artists opening for them.\n\nFresh from the excitement of being on their first world tour, and funded by a music label, Thes One and Double K were anxious to try new sampling and recording techniques that they had learned since the first album. They also took the time to refine their lyrical style with less battle raps and guest appearances.\n\nThe result was their second full-length album, \"Question in the Form of an Answer\", released in June 2000. Like \"The Next Step\", the album was nearly 75 minutes, self-recorded and used an eclectic and diverse range of beats rooted in jazz and psychedelic rock. However, the album used a much larger degree of filtering techniques that Thes One had learned from studying analog sound equipment.\n\nThe lead 12\" single for the second album, \"Youth Explosion\", sold the full run of 15,000 copies pressed in its first month, and was not repressed in order to promote the second and third singles, \"The Cat\" and \"We'll Be There\", which also went on to sell 15,000 copies each. Om later released white-label, \"limited edition repress\" versions of \"Youth Explosion\" and \"The Cat\" without covers.\n\nPeople Under the Stairs embarked on a second world tour to support the record, this time adding Japan and Australia to their routing. A highlight of the tour was taking part in the UK Glastonbury Festival in June 2000 as the opening performers in the Dance Tent with Dilated Peoples and the Saïan Supa Crew. The tour culminated in a July 2001 performance at the Essential Music Festival in London where the group joined with Biz Markie, Ice-T, Gerry \"Jeru\" Mulligan, Masta Ace and De La Soul on the final Sunday of the festival.\n\nWhile People Under the Stairs was on tour in 2000, they also packaged and released a limited run of their first compilation album, \"American Men Vol. 1\", sold at concert venues. Om Records also re-released \"The Next Step\" in 2001.\n\nDuring 2001, while on tour in Europe, Thes One and Double K had been utilizing their tour income and their \"Question...\" album profits to steadily amass a large supply of vinyl records. Back at home in Los Angeles, Thes One and Double K were also beginning to see more exposure on the local scene, and Thes One took part in a live DJing \"beat battle\" against fellow Los Angeles recording artist will.i.am on April 25, 2002. Using this new-found material and the life experience they had gained from touring and shows, Thes One and Double K began piecing together their third album in between tour dates.\n\nThe album was released in June 2002 as \"O.S.T.\". The album was again produced in Thes One's home by the duo and released on Om records. \"O.S.T.\" proved to be more complex than the group's first albums, using a larger variety of samples (culled from vinyl collected all over the world), and the samples were pieced together in more intricate ways. For example, the track \"Montego Slay\" used over 20 minuscule sections of music from Jamaican tourist souvenir records, cut and reorganized seamlessly into a new rhythm. The group also used live instrumentation for the first time on a release by having musician and producer Headnodic (of the Crown City Rockers and The Mighty Underdogs) play electric bass on the album closer \"The Breakdown\".\n\nIn the fall of 2002, People Under the Stairs supported the release of \"O.S.T.\" by playing at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, and also by taking part in the second-annual US Cali-Comm hip hop tour with Del the Funky Homosapien, KutMasta Kurt, Planet Asia, and the Lifesavas. During the supporting tour for the album, the songs \"Acid Raindrops\" and \"L.A. Song\" became fan favorites, and they are performed by the band live regularly.\n\nAfter receiving a funding advance for the final album with Om, Thes One purchased a Neve 5116/32 mixing console that ended up being used for the next two releases, as well as other albums that Thes One produced for other artists. The console was so large (1,300 lbs) that he had to enlist the help of Giant Panda and cut a hole in a wall to get it up to the second floor of his home recording studio.\n\nThe final album released through the contract with Om Records was \"...Or Stay Tuned\", released in the fall of 2003. This is the group's shortest album, clocking in at 43 minutes, and it was originally marketed and labeled as an EP release, due to contractual issues. While it contains several new tracks, it has a pseudo-compilation feel due to the inclusion of several remixes and outtakes from the \"O.S.T.\" sessions. In the years since the album's release, the group has counted it among their main album catalog, as it was released on double-vinyl and meets the criteria for being full-length. After the release of \"...Or Stay Tuned\", People Under the Stairs embarked on another world tour.\n\nIn 2004, Thes One and Double K found themselves free of their record contract with Om Records. In an effort to expand his knowledge of production and the music industry, Thes One began work on a number of side projects. He co-founded Tres Records with Chikara Kurahashi from Giant Panda, and released two 12-inch singles on the label, \"Noonen\" (an ode to the 1980 comedy film, \"Caddyshack\") and \"Doin' It\" (with Raashan Ahmad of Crown City Rockers). In May 2004, he coordinated the \"Bloquera\" project, a trip to southern-most Baja California to record an EP with members of Giant Panda and shoot a video on Super 8. Following this trip, he began executive producing and mixing the debut album of Giant Panda, \"Fly School Reunion\".\n\nNow that People Under the Stairs were not protected by the safety net of being signed with a record label, the group felt personally responsible for the direction and success of their music. As a result, the group started to move away from the \"party life\" they had enjoyed while making the previous albums, and the musical and lyrical themes that would be present on their next record reflected that growth.\n\nIn 2005, People Under the Stairs inked a deal with a smaller, local Los Angeles label, Basement Records, for domestic release of their next album (with overseas distribution by Tres Records), and they returned to the studio to begin production. Feeling that sample-based hip hop was becoming stale, repetitive and single-oriented, People Under the Stairs made a conscious decision to completely change everything about their sound and image for the new album. They wanted to create a cohesive album with a broader, less-jazzy sound palate. They even went so far as to strip down the album cover to a minimalist look and change the branding and logos that had been present on the previous albums. They also invited Double K's idol, George Clinton, to perform on an album interlude.\n\nJust before the release of the album, the group grew annoyed by the internet music piracy and peer-to-peer file sharing that was in full force by the mid-2000s. In a move that was equal parts a precautionary measure and a joke aimed at over-eager fans, People Under the Stairs decided to \"leak\" a fake version of the album onto the internet in the month preceding the album's release in 2006.\n\nWhen the real album was released in April, \"Stepfather\" debuted at #32 on the \"Billboard\" Heatseaker Chart and #35 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart, and the album was met with widespread positive reviews and received more coverage than the group's previous efforts.\n\n\"Stepfather\" also drew the attention of a new audience. At initial in-store concerts in support of the album, Thes One and Double K noticed that the average age of the people coming out to support them was much younger than they were expecting. Excited that they were reaching a new generation of hip hop connoisseurs, the group asked for their United States tour dates to be \"all ages\" shows and in-store appearances at record shops in an effort to reach out to the new young fans.\n\nThey toured the US through Spring 2006, taking along the then-unknown rock-rap group Gym Class Heroes as their opening act. In the Summer and Fall of 2006, the group embarked on another world tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Europe. For the Europe leg of the tour, they were accompanied by Giant Panda.\n\nIn the period following \"Stepfather\" and before People Under the Stairs began work on their next album, Thes One released his debut solo album (and experimental project of three years), \"Lifestyle Marketing\", on Tres Records, and the album was well received in the hip hop community. Double K also released a solo instrumental track, \"Face to Face\", on a split single with Los Angeles producer Olde Soul.\n\nIn 2007, the group performed additional concerts in the UK and the Western United States, and in the days leading up to 2008, the group kicked off another tour in Australia. Having played concerts in Australia many times since 2004, Thes One and Double K wrote a new song, \"The Wiz\", about their experiences in the country. In Spring 2008, the group worked with director Matt Bird to film a video for the song while on location in Bondi Beach. The filming of the video involved underwater cameras, cranes, and a helicopter shot, and was the group's first music video.\n\nBack in Los Angeles for the summer, Thes One and Double K started recording sessions for their next album. While they were hard at work in the studio, Om Records took the opportunity to release a retrospective album, \"The Om Years\" of the group's most popular songs from their first four albums, and a bonus CD of b-sides and rarities was also included.\n\nPeople Under the Stairs finished recording in fall 2008 and released their new album, \"FUN DMC\", in September. Like the previous album, Thes One and Double K had tried another independent record label, Gold Dust Media, and the album received positive reviews. The album debuted at #6 on the Billboard Heatseekers List in October. The name of the album is partly a homage to the group Run–D.M.C., but also an expression of what the group felt that they provided to their listeners: a relaxing party album, with bits of introspection mixed in. For the first time, the group decided to create a concept album involving the daily life of someone living and enjoying themselves in the Los Angeles neighborhoods where they have lived and grown up. They brought recording equipment to a South Central summer house party and barbecue, and used the ambient noise from the party to supplement the \"daytime\" songs on the new album.\n\nOn \"FUN DMC\", People Under the Stairs featured the reggae artist Odell, and their long-time drinking buddy, Blvme, on the sultry, uptempo jam \"California\".\nBlvme is the only engineer to record People Under the Stairs on the mic in the booth at the same time.\n\nFollowing a nationwide tour of the US in support of the album, People Under the Stairs celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a sold out show on December 19, 2008, at the historic El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, performing multiple songs from every album. The performance was released on DVD the following year.\n\nPeople Under the Stairs dedicated the first half of 2009 to more touring in support of \"Fun DMC\", and even celebrated several touring \"firsts\". In February, People Under the Stairs became one of the only independent American music groups to tour China, selling out shows in both Beijing and Shanghai. Thes One and Double K also performed on the opening days of both the Coachella Music Festival in April and the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June. Spin Magazine was particularly impressed with People Under The Stairs' Bonnaroo performance, declaring them one of the 25 \"Must-Hear Acts\" of the year, citing their performance as \"the most crowded\" first-day act, and branding them the \"Best Party Starter.\" Feeling inspired by their touring success, the group immediately returned to the studio following their Bonnaroo concert to begin recording more tracks.\n\nDue to a backlog issues with Gold Dust Media and incentives offered by Om Records, People Under the Stairs made a return to Om for their next album. Om helped the group obtain licensing from Colt 45 for a 7-inch single and Vans for a remix contest. Released in October, \"Carried Away\" debuted at #5 on the iTunes hip hop charts and at #23 on the \"Billboard\" Heatseeker Charts.\n\nThough demand to tour the US following the release of Carried Away was strong, People Under the Stairs embarked on another world tour, including visiting Brazil and the southern cape of Africa for the first time. In late 2010 and early 2011, they did a limited tour-date run through the Western US on a \"Secret House Party\" tour.\n\nStill disappointed with the way that the various record labels had handled the duo's product during the first decade of their career, Thes One made the decision after \"Carried Away\" to take complete control of the production process for the group's albums from start-to-finish and release all new material under a new business entity, Piecelock 70. The name \"Piecelock 70\" (also styled as PL70) has existed as Thes One's corporate touring account since 2004, but Thes One took the opportunity to actually construct a whole new recording facility in downtown Los Angeles and make the name a label and a brand.\n\nPiecelock 70 released the future People Under the Stairs albums over the following years, and also material by other artists, including Headnodic (of the Crown City Rockers and The Mighty Underdogs), DJ Day and Doc Delay. Thes One made the decision to run Piecelock 70 under a worker cooperative business model, and allow hard-working artists to retain complete control over their output while pooling and sharing resources and taking advantage of the label's facilities.\n\nOn June 17, 2011, People Under the Stairs joined a large and eclectic group of musicians, including Girl Talk, Big Boi, Pretty Lights, Mac Miller, and Empire of the Sun, to kick off the inaugural Governor's Ball Music Festival in NYC. While on stage at the show, Thes One and Double K announced the name of their eighth album: \"Highlighter\".\n\nReleased on September 30, 2011, \"Highlighter\" was the first album on the new Piecelock 70 label, and it was released on limited-edition, yellow-streaked audiophile vinyl, in addition to the standard CD and iTunes release formats. Like \"Stepfather\", the album was one of the more experimental releases for the group, employing alternate time-signatures, live instrumentation, and even a string section.\n\n\"Highlighter\" was also distinctive because it was the first commercial album offered with a concurrent digital download in 24-bit HD-AAC format. In addition to the 24-bit files, consumers would also received Serato-tagged 320kbit/s MP3 files. Thes One decided to release the album in the new HD-AAC format after attending an Audio Engineering Society convention, meeting with the Fraunhofer Society, and reading a white paper on the new format. With the 16-bit compact disc becoming increasingly obsolete in a digital market, Thes One felt that it would break new ground for the recording industry. During the first few days of the album's release, the servers providing the music files crashed several times due to high demand and the large file size, but reception to the sound quality and the album was positive.\n\nOn July 19, 2012, People Under the Stairs were invited by fellow Los Angeles hip hop musician (and high-school friend) Murs to play at a concert series in support of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). Their performance was a stand-out part of the evening, drawing a large crowd response.\n\nPeople Under the Stairs continued to tour in early 2014, appearing in Texas at both the Paste Untapped Indie Music & Beer Festival in Fort Worth on March 8 and at SXSW in Austin on March 13.\n\nOn January 28, 2014, Thes One announced on social media that People Under the Stairs' ninth full-length album would be titled \"12 Step Program\" (also promoted as \"12SP\"). On April 7, 2014, PUTS released the music video for the lead single, \"1 Up Til Sun Up\", on YouTube and began pre-orders for the digital album on iTunes.\n\nA week before the album's release on May 6, 2014, pre-orders for limited amounts of physical copies of \"12 Step Program\" (on vinyl record, cassette tape and compact disc) were announced on the band's official website, and over the next 24 hours, the website's server crashed 4 times due to eager fans. The album debuted at #56 on the iTunes charts, #7 on the iTunes rap charts, #11 on the Billboard Heatseeker charts, and #33 on the Billboard R&B/Rap Album charts.\n\nTouring stretched into 2015, including a June 5 performance with special guest Greg Nice in New York at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. During the show, the group announced their next album and that Nice would be featured on the record. Later in the year, the group revealed their tenth album would be a three-part EP comprising six songs each, titled \"The Gettin' Off Stage.\"\n\nIn anticipation of the release, the group did a series of live videos on Facebook from their studio and also a pressing plant where the vinyl record was being manufactured. Additionally, the group posted four previously unreleased songs to their SoundCloud account as \"American Men Vol. 2.\" A new web site (PUTS.band) launched as well and replaced Piecelock70.com.\n\n\"The Gettin' Off Stage, Step 1\" was released Friday, November 20, 2015 on MP3, CD, and vinyl. The vinyl pressing was limited to 1,000 units and quickly sold out. The release was supported by three shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago; the group ended the year with multiple shows in Colorado.\n\nIn 2016, the group performed in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Missoula, and Santa Barbara. Thes One then announced on his Instagram account that \"The Gettin' Off Stage, Step 2\" would be released on 4/20. Shows were subsequently scheduled for 4/20 in Santa Cruz and 4/21 in Oakland.\n\nIn August 2018, People Under the Stairs released the single 'Drinking & Jivin'. In a press release, the duo said of the single: \"We dug deep and revisited a simpler time on this one: old Mountain Dew commercials – People waterskiing behind horses, rope swings, bridge jumps, National Parks, camping and the great American promise of a wilderness and outdoors shared and loved by all. This is a song for the last days of summer, for the memories we’ve had and those we’ll still make. We hope the vibe transports you to our campfire where we sit, have a drink and share the last glimmers of August light together as one nation under a groove.” \n\nOn February 1, 2019, People Under the Stairs released their final album \"Sincerely, The P\" on MP3, CD and limited vinyl and cassette recordings. Thes One revealed on social media that 'Sincerely' would be their final album, marking their 21 years in the music industry since they released \"The Next Step\" back in 1998.\n\nDuring the time before Thes One and Double K met through the early years as People Under the Stairs, the group attended hip hop shows at many of the Los Angeles venues (such as the Good Life Café) that were a part of the explosion of West Coast hip hop acts. In numerous interviews, the group has cited many of these groups that had a direct or peripheral influence on their sound, including Freestyle Fellowship, The Pharcyde, Jurassic 5, The Beatnuts, and many others.\n\nIn addition, other hip hop acts from the 1980s and early 1990s influenced the group's sound. The group has paid direct homage to A Tribe Called Quest on the song \"Check the Vibe\" on 2009's \"Carried Away\". Double K grew up listening to DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Public Enemy, West Coast gangsta rap such as DJ Quik and Eazy-E, and a large amount of 1980s disco rap. The latter influence is especially apparent in the “Letters” song cycle that stretches over the group's 2006–2009 albums.\n\nThes One and Double K have described themselves as musicians first and rappers second, but despite that distinction (or perhaps because of it), they have developed a distinctive lyrical style with several recurring themes.\n\nFor the most part, the group avoids meddling with sociopolitical or activist themes, gangster rap, battle rap, and material wealth. Instead, they tend to focus on personal experiences and enjoyment, including life in (and pride for) Los Angeles, video gaming, barbecues and food, recreational drug use (mostly beer and marijuana), and relaxing. A small portion of songs have dealt with more serious themes, but even these have been tied to gratitude for or remembrance of family and friends.\n\nThroughout their albums, the group also constantly refers to the subject of music and its importance to their lives. They discuss record collecting, sampling, DJing, older music forms or artists that they respect, and the state of the music industry.\n\nPeople Under the Stairs draw on a wide array of record samples to create their work. During their formative years and all the way through 2006's \"Stepfather\", the group engaged heavily in finding and procuring rare records, and these records covered the genre gamut from jazz and funk, to rock and spoken word.\n\nThe group is secretive with regard to their sample sources, and they encourage listeners and fans to do their own music research and seek out sources on their own. The group makes a conscious effort to \"clear\" all of their samples with the originating artists, but due to the legal complexities surrounding the practice, they have indicated their distaste of fan-based sample posting on the Internet and the hurt it can cause to hip hop artists.\n\nIn the years since 2006, People Under the Stairs have re-focused their sampling technique. Reacting to the increasing competition among hip hop artists to find the rarest records, the group decided to focus more on expanding their sonic palette (even going so far as to utilize live instrumentation on their most recent albums).\n\nOne of the key differences between Thes One and Double K at the time of the group's formation was the use of different sampling devices: Thes One had recently purchased an Akai MPC3000, while Double K was utilizing an E-mu SP-1200. The differences in the way the two samplers handled data intrigued Thes One, so he made an extensive study of the history of electronic instrumentation and sampling machines, from the work of Roger Linn to improve Akai's products to Phil Collins' efforts to create drum machines. He has incorporated this knowledge into the group's sound and recording techniques. He has even given college lectures on the subject.\n\nAs mainstays on the Los Angeles hip hop scene, Thes One and Double K have become friends with many other names in the music world. The group has worked with George Clinton (Double K is a member of Clinton's Funk Mob), members of the Living Legends crew, Ugly Duckling, Jurassic 5, Hieroglyphics, and members of the Crown City Rockers.\n\nDespite being considered \"underground\" and never having achieved breakout mainstream success, they have been lauded by many other acclaimed artists, including Chuck D of Public Enemy, Biz Markie, and Trey Anastasio of the rock band Phish. The group has never been worried about their reception from (or direction of) the popular market, and Thes One has stated many times that People Under The Stairs have always focused on their artistry and music knowledge ahead of monetary success and fame, and in some ways, they still consider themselves two guys who like to make music instead of a \"group\".\n\nIn 2010, People Under the Stairs were chosen as one of the numerous musical artists to appear in and remix the main theme for \"The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!\". The group has also had music featured in Run's House, Entourage, and the feature film Street Dreams.\n\nIn October 2011, Mac Miller released a mixtape, \"I Love Life, Thank You\" which included a direct homage to the group on the song \"People Under the Stairs\". As a way to promote the next generation of hip hop and connect with its fans, People Under the Stairs opened for Miller during several shows on his \"Blue Slide Park\" tour that year.\n\n\n"}

The two starships' crews are happy to intermingle. Commander Tucker becomes intrigued when he meets a Vissian couple in the mess hall accompanied by a third member of their race, and learns that the being, which has no name, is a \"cogenitor\" - a third gender in Vissian biology. Cogenitors are needed to complete reproduction: they do not genetically contribute to offspring, but supply an enzyme required for fertilization. Since cogenitors only constitute 3% of the population, Vissians must apply to have a cogenitor assigned to them when they intend to conceive a child. Cogenitors are considered mentally deficient, and they are not citizens on equal terms with men and women.\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere on the ship, Lieutenant Reed finds himself the romantic focus of a female Vissian crewmember - their tactical officer.

Tucker, however, becomes increasingly intent on the rights of the cogenitor and learns, with the help of Doctor Phlox, that they are actually equally intelligent. On the alien vessel, without the couple's knowledge, Tucker secretly encourages the cogenitor to learn to read, while building a friendship with it. Despite having a near-total lack of education available, it is an insatiable learner. Soon learning the importance of names, it then asks to be called Charles (Commander Tucker's own first name).\n\n'Charles' soon realizes that future life in Vissian society would be unfulfilling; it then leaves and requests political asylum. Archer now returns to find himself in the middle of a first contact diplomatic crisis, with the Vissians confused and defensive at Tucker's interference in their traditions. Tucker appeals to Archer's sense of justice, but he sides with the Vissians. With the cogenitor returned, the Vissians hope good relations with the humans can continue. Later communications, however, reveal that the now despondent Charles has committed suicide, thereby delaying the birth of the Vissian's child, and straining the relations between the two species. Archer then summons Tucker and severely reprimands him for his lack of professionalism and judgment.\n\nThe guest cast in \"Cogenitor\" included the return of Andreas Katsulas in the role of the Vissian captain. Katsulas had previously appeared in several episodes of \"\", but is perhaps most famous for his role as Ambassador G'Kar on \"Babylon 5\". Shortly after filming \"Cogenitor\", Katsulas was diagnosed with incurable lung cancer.\n\nWhen Tucker chooses a movie to show to the cogenitor, two of the options that appear on the screen are \"Dixon Hill and the Black Orchid\" and \"The Bride of Chaotica\", which refer to holodeck adventures of characters from other Star Trek series - respectively, Jean-Luc Picard's Dixon Hill and Tom Paris's Captain Proton.\n\nMichelle Erica Green, while writing for Trek Nation, described \"Cogenitor\" as the best episode of \"Enterprise\" up to that time (implying that it surpassed even \"Dear Doctor\") and noted similarities to \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and the Xenogenesis trilogy (\"Lilith's Brood\").\nJamahl Epsicokhan, on his website Jammer's Reviews, said that it was \"the best and most probing episode of the season\".\n\n\n"}

Her father was David Holtby and her mother, Alice, was afterwards the first alderwoman on the East Riding County Council. Holtby was educated at home by a governess and then at Queen Margaret's School in Scarborough. Although she passed the entrance exam for Somerville College, Oxford in 1917, she chose to join the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in early 1918 but soon after she arrived in France, the First World War came to an end and she returned home.\n\nIn 1919, she returned to study at the University of Oxford where she met Vera Brittain, a fellow student and later the author of \"Testament of Youth\", with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship. Other literary contemporaries at Somerville College included Hilda Reid, Margaret Kennedy and Sylvia Thompson. After graduating from Oxford, in 1921, Winifred and Vera moved to London, hoping to establish themselves as writers (the blue plaque at No. 82 Doughty Street refers).\n\nHoltby was, together with Brittain, an ardent feminist, socialist and pacifist. She lectured extensively for the League of Nations Union and was a member of the feminist Six Point Group. She was active in the Independent Labour Party and was a staunch campaigner for the unionisation of black workers in South Africa, during which she had considerable contact with Leonard Woolf.\nIn a 1926 article, Holtby wrote:Personally, I am a feminist … because I dislike everything that feminism implies. … I want to be about the work in which my real interests lie … But while … injustice is done and opportunity denied to the great majority of women, I shall have to be a feminist.After Brittain's marriage in 1925 to George Catlin, Holtby shared her friend's homes in Nevern Place and subsequently at 19 Glebe Place, Chelsea; Catlin resented the arrangement and his wife's close friendship with Holtby, who nevertheless became an adoptive aunt to Brittain's two children, John and Shirley (Baroness Shirley Williams).\n\nHoltby began to suffer from high blood pressure, recurrent headaches and bouts of lassitude, and in 1931 she was diagnosed as suffering from Bright's disease. Her doctor gave her only two years to live. Aware of her impending death, Holtby put all her remaining energy into what became her most important book, \"South Riding\". Winifred Holtby died on 29 September 1935, aged 37. She never married, though she had an unsatisfactory relationship with a man named Harry Pearson, who proposed to her on her deathbed.\n\nHoltby's early novels – \"Anderby Wold\" (1923), \"The Crowded Street\" (1924) (re-published by Persephone Books in 2008, having been broadcast the previous year as a ten-part BBC Radio 4 dramatisation by Diana Griffiths) and \"The Land of Green Ginger\" (1927) – met with moderate success.\n\nHoltby's fame was derived mainly from her journalism: she wrote for more than 20 newspapers and magazines, including the feminist journal \"Time and Tide\" (also serving on the board of directors) and the \"Manchester Guardian\" newspaper. She also wrote a regular weekly column for the trade union magazine \"The Schoolmistress\". Her books during this period included two novels, \"Poor Caroline\" (1931), \"Mandoa! Mandoa!\" (1933), a critical study of Virginia Woolf (1932) and a volume of short stories, \"Truth is Not Sober\" (1934).\n\nAs well as her journalism, Holtby wrote 14 books, including six novels; two volumes of short stories; the first critical study of Virginia Woolf (1932) and \"Women and a changing civilization\" (1934), a feminist survey with opinions that are still relevant. She dedicated the latter book to composer Dame Ethel Smyth and actress and writer Cicely Hamiltion, both strong suffragists who \"did more than write\"The March of the Women\", the song composed in 1910 for the Women's Social and Political Union. She also wrote poetry, including poems about Vera Brittain's dead brother, Edward.\n\nIn \"Women and a changing civilisation\" Holtby linked the 1930s reaction against feminism to a broader \"revolt against reason which has affected the intellectual life of the entire Western World.\" Holtby contextualized the rise of the Nazis, and the Western turn to the political Right in general, as a reaction to the broader upheavals of war and depression: \"Just after the [First World] war, society was infected by a rush of idealism to the head. Democracy and reason, equality and co-operation were acclaimed as uncontested virtues. In the new constitutions of Europe and America were incorporated splendid statements about the freedom of opinion, equality of the sexes, accessibility of education. We were about to build a brave new world upon the ruins of catastrophe ... About 1926, after the General Strike in England and its failure, after the entry of Germany into the League of Nations and the delay by the Powers in making good their promises, the slump in idealism began to set in. Reason, democracy, the effort of the individual human will, liberty and equality were at a discount.\" Holtby noted that a former politician had explained the apathy of young women with reference to their experience of \"huge impersonal events - the War, the Boom, the Slump. News is reported daily of immense catastrophes over which they can have no control, the Japanese and Indian earthquakes, Chinese famine, African drought ... The individual will seems unimportant, the individual personality is dwarfed, by happenings on so large a scale ... This is the slump complex - this narrowing of ambition, this closing-in alike of ideas and opportunities. Somewhere, a spring of vitality and hope has failed.\" Holtby perceived feminism as necessarily tied to Enlightenment rationality, progress, and social engineering: \"The attempt to create communities where men and women alike share the full stature of humanity is an attempt to do something which has not been done before, and which can only be achieved under certain conditions. And one of these is the acceptance of reason as a guide in human conduct. If we choose an anti-rational philosophy, in this quest, at least, we are defeated. The enemies of reason are inevitably the opponents of 'equal rights.'\"\n\nHoltby is best remembered for her novel \"South Riding\" edited by Vera Brittain and published posthumously in March 1936, which received high praise from the critics. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for 1936 and has never been out of print. In 1938, it was made into a film directed by Victor Saville; in 1974 it was adapted by Stan Barstow for Yorkshire Television and in 2011, BBC One produced a three-part dramatisation by Andrew Davies. There have also been several radio adaptations, the most recent for BBC Radio Four in 2005.\n\nVera Brittain wrote about her friendship with Holtby in her book \"Testament of Friendship\" (1940) and in 1960, published a censored edition of their correspondence. Their letters, along with many of Holtby's other papers, were donated in 1960 to Hull Central Library in Yorkshire and are now held at the Hull History Centre. Other papers are in Bridlington library in Yorkshire, in McMaster University Library in Canada and in the University of Cape Town library in South Africa. A biography by Marion Shaw of Holtby, entitled \"The Clear Stream\", was published in 1999 and draws on a broad range of sources.\n\nHoltby was buried in All Saints' churchyard in Rudston, East Yorkshire, just yards from the house in which she was born. Her epitaph in her words is \"God give me work till my life shall end and life till my work is done\".\n\nAll her novels together with a collection of short stories and a collection of her journalism were reprinted by Virago in the Virago Modern Classics series in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1967, the Royal Society of Literature instituted the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for the best regional novel of the year. In 2003 it was incorporated into the Ondaatje Prize. On her death she left a small legacy and her own collection of books to a library in Soweto which was opened in December 1940. It was named the Winifred Holtby Memorial Library. It was the first library to be built in Africa specifically for non Europeans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is known as the \"Sports College\" largely due to its prowess on the Sports field but also has a diversity of events that cater to all tastes.\n\nJames College is named after Lord James of Rusholme, the University of York's first vice-chancellor, and was built in several stages during the 1990s. Initially James was intended to be a postgraduate-only college, however the university began to rapidly expand in size, almost doubling in size from 4,300 to 8,500 students, in 1993, therefore it was decided that the college should become open to undergraduates.\n\nAs of 2019, it consists of thirteen accommodation blocks lettered from \"A\" to \"N\" (missing out \"I\") located across a cable-stayed bridge from Wentworth College and close to the old Goodricke College buildings and the university's sports centre.\n\nThere are three types of accommodation; standard houses, ensuite houses and ensuite flats. Blocks ABC are arranged into houses with a small kitchen on the ground floor. There are 3 houses per block which house 16 people (14 standard single rooms and one double room). Blocks DEF are the older-style ensuite blocks which are also arranged into houses with a kitchen on the ground floor.\n\nBlocks GHJKLM are the newest blocks and all have ensuite rooms, consisting of a 'pod' or wet room containing a shower, toilet and sink. Each block is (generally) divided into 6 flats which have a kitchen per flat. The kitchens are shared between 6 and 9 people. In 2009, James College acquired a block from the former site of Goodricke college which has become N block, which is catered, along with ABC blocks. The College Dean and College Tutors live in college.\n\nJames has a number of common rooms, hosts the YUSU bar 'The Lounge' and is the closest college to the University Sports centre, playing fields and Health Centre.\n\nThe quads have lent themselves to the most famous James College tradition, \"Quad Dash\", held in Week 7 of Summer term. Quad Dash models itself on the film \"Chariots of Fire\". It was the brainchild of James College Chair, Fergus Drake. College residents turn out in their hundreds to enjoy a day of sunshine, free beer, quad races, ice cream, bouncy castles and fun.\n\nThe college also runs an annual photography competition in conjunction with PhotoSoc, with prizes in a number of categories and dedicated James prizes. The JCR put on annual formal events, normally at Christmas and in the Summer term.\n\nThe James College Annual Lecture is delivered by a distinguished speaker on a topic of interest to the college. In recent years these have included:\n2010 – Duncan Petrie – 'The Swinging Sixties'\n2011 – Steve Bell, award-winning Guardian Cartoonist\n2012 – Fergus Drake, Save the Children,- 'The reality of humanitarian aid in a fragile world'\n\nWithin the college, a number of 'Taste' events take place each term, where students and members of the college are invited to introduce others to a taster of their own culture through a presentation, demonstration or media. This is normally accompanied, by traditional cuisine and drinks. Alongside these cultural exchange events, the college runs a unique exchange with Morningside College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with students from each institution spending a number of terms or a year at the other. James College and Durham University's Collingwood College enjoy an annual sporting contest and social weekend, with York and Durham taking turns to host the event. James College currently holds the JC Cup, winning a closely fought encounter in Autumn 2012.\n\nJames is known as the \"Sports College\" on campus, largely due to its supreme prowess in the Sports field. For the 2019 Durham Varsity, James sent eight teams to the competition, more than any other College at the university.\n\nThe JCRC is the student-run body that manages Freshers Week, weekly events and . In 2018, Freshers' Week saw a large focus on Non-Clubbing events as well as the traditional clubbing portfolio.\n\nList of chairs of the James College JCRC:\n\n\nAs with the rest of the University's West Campus James College is home to several hundred ducks, geese, other assorted wildfowl, and rabbits. \n\nKen Todd was the head of James College from its opening until his retirement in September 2007. Initially the position was titled Provost, but from 2013 this was changed to principal, this has subsequently been changed to head of college.

Being experienced with caving, Ensign Mayweather is chosen to lead Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed on the underground rescue mission. They have only three days to return to the surface with the scientists before the negotiated government ceasefire expires.\n\nAs the \"Enterprise\" nears the planet, it comes to the aid of an alien evacuee transport, suffering from a dangerous radiation leak. The most seriously injured of the various aliens brought aboard is Hudak, an Antaran, whose species has a centuries long history of conflict and animosity with the Denobulans. Though suffering from a fatal case of radiation poisoning, and being the first time the divorced species have interacted in generations, he immediately refuses help from Doctor Phlox. Archer orders Phlox to treat him, but he reluctantly declines, since Denobulan medical ethics places the patient's wishes above all other considerations.\n\nUnderground, the crew make good progress, but Mayweather injures his leg. Leaving him behind, Reed and Tucker soon locate the Denobulan geologists, who are happily engaged in recording the various rare and precious geological features of the cavern.

About 7,500 species are known worldwide. Many are conspicuous and some are aposematically colored, announcing their toxicity to would-be predators.\n\nBlister beetles are hypermetamorphic, going through several larval stages, the first of which is typically a mobile triungulin. The larvae are insectivorous, mainly attacking bees, though a few feed on grasshopper eggs. While sometimes considered parasitoids, in general, the meloid larva apparently consumes the immature host along with its provisions, and can often survive on the provisions alone; thus it is not an obligatory parasitoid, but rather a facultative parasitoid, or simply a kleptoparasite. The adults sometimes feed on flowers and leaves of plants of such diverse families as the Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Solanaceae.\n\nCantharidin, a poisonous chemical that causes blistering of the skin, is secreted as a defensive agent. It is used medically to remove warts and is collected for this purpose from species of the genera \"Mylabris\" and \"Lytta\", especially \"Lytta vesicatoria\", better known as \"Spanish fly\".\n\nCantharidin is the principal irritant in \"Spanish fly\", a folk medicine prepared from dried beetles in the family Meloidae.\n\nThe largest genus, \"Epicauta\", contains many species toxic to horses. A few beetles consumed in a single feeding of alfalfa hay may be lethal. In semiarid areas of the western United States, modern harvesting techniques may contribute to cantharidin content in harvested forage. The practice of hay conditioning, crushing the stalks to promote drying, also crushes any beetles present and causes the release of cantharidin into the fodder. Blister beetles are attracted to alfalfa and weeds during bloom. Reducing weeds and timing harvests before and after bloom are sound management practices. Using equipment without hay conditioners may reduce beetle mortality and allow them to escape before baling.\n\nTribe Derideini\nTribe Morphozonitini\n\nTribe Eleticini\nTribe Spasticini\n\nTribe Cerocomini\nTribe Epicautini\n\nTribe Eupomphini\n\nTribe Lyttini\n\nTribe Meloini\nTribe Mylabrini\n\n\nTribe Pyrotini\nGenera \"incertae sedis\"\n\nTribe Horiini\nTribe Nemognathini\n\nTribe Sitarini\nGenera \"incertae sedis\"\n\nTribe Tetraonycini\n\n\n"}

In 1977, the independent mission society was merged into the work of the Evangelical-Lutheran Mission in Lower Saxony. As a result, it became an institution recognised by the state church.\n\nOn 12 October 1849, Louis Harms (1808–1865) founded the Hermannsburg Mission Seminary. This date counts as the foundation date for the Hermannsburg Mission.\nHarms worked at St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Hermannsburg on the Lüneburg Heath, from 1844, initially as a curate and, later, as its Lutheran pastor. He was considered a good minister by the community and had a great talent for bringing things alive. On Sunday evenings, the villagers gathered in the hallway of the rectory to listen to him. His stories simultaneously entertained, instructed and built people up. Local history provided him with lively material. His stories were published in the anthologies \"Honnig\" (Low German: \"Honey\") and \"Goldene Äpfel in silbernen Schalen\" (\"Golden Apples in Silver Dishes\").\n\nWith his preaching Harms sparked a revival movement that reached as far as the patricians in nearby Hamburg. On 12 October 1849, the first students moved into the Hermannsburg Mission Seminary, newly founded by Harms. He appointed his brother, Theodor, as the first director. Harms campaigned tirelessly for donations. The eloquent and energetic evangelist managed to interest a large number of poor men from the heath in mission service, not unlike the effect that David Livingstone had on the poor of Scotland.\n\nHarms had a vision to begin his missionary work with the Oromo people (then called the \"Galla\") in East Africa. The necessary funds were raised from the Hermannsburg congregation and later a large circle of friends. He even succeeded in building his own mission ship, the \"Candace\", which was named after the Ethiopian queen, Candace, mentioned in Acts 8.27. The attempt to get to Ethiopia, failed however. Consequently, the Hermannsburg missionaries landed at Port Natal (now Durban) in South Africa in 1854. There they began to work among the Zulu people, and from 1857, were also operating in the Transvaal. In 1864, August Mylius started his work with the Telugu in southern India.\n\nAfter the death of Louis Harms, his brother Theodor Harms (1818–1885) became his successor. Under his leadership, the seminary and missionary activity was further expanded. In 1879, the second mission house was built and Carl Mützelfeldt (1842–1927) became its first director in the appointment of \"mission inspector\".\nUnder the leadership of Theodor Harms', successors, Egmont Harms, (1885–1916) and George Haccius (1916–1926) the missionary work was strengthened . New areas were opened up: Australia (1866), North America (1866), New Zealand (1875), Iran (1880), Brazil (1898 ) and Ethiopia (1927). In the long run, however, not all areas could continue to be supported.\n\nAfter the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover by Prussia opposition was stirring, especially in Hermannsburg to the introduction by the King of Prussia of compulsory civil marriage in 1876 and the adoption of a new marriage liturgy in the state.\n\nTheodor Harms was especially vehement in his opposition. As a result, Harms and a number of other pastors were removed from office. He left the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover and was followed by the majority of the Hermannsburg community. On 13 February 1878, they established the Lutheran Church of the Cross, independently of the state church.\nAt the Synod in Hermannsburg on 30 April 1878, under the chairmanship of Theodore Harms, pastors and representatives of the independent churches of the country founded the Hanoverian Evangelical Lutheran Free Church. In 1886, they split again. Thirteen parishes formed the \"Hermannsburg Free Church\".\n\nSeparation from the state church had serious consequences for the Hermannsburg Mission. Collections from the Hanoverian national church and its character as the public body were both lost. In 1890, there was an agreement between the Hanover church and the Hermannsburg Free Church. So that members of both the state and free church were represented in the mission's management, the office of co-director (\"Kondirektor\") was created, which existed until 1972\n\nThe head of the mission is known as the director (\"Direktor\")\n\nIn 1977, the formal integration of the Hermannsburg Mission into the state church took place. By maintaining the legal status of the foundation, however, it remained possible to preserve the special character of the spiritual work here. As the Evangelical-Lutheran Mission in Lower Saxony (ELM), it continues to be based in Hermannsburg. The head of the mission's work since 2003 is Rev. Martina Helmer-Pham Xuan.\n\nThe most important contributors to the work are the Evangelical-Lutheran state churches of Hanover, Brunswick and Schaumburg-Lippe. In addition, many parishes and friends of the mission support its work. The ELM is also supported by private donations from many people in the region. Currently missionaries and missionaries sent out by the ELM are working in Africa, Latin America, India and Siberia.\n\nThe mission maintains a mission seminary in Hermannsburg to this day, where young theologians are prepared for service within one of the partner churches of the ELM. The Ludwig Harms House in Hermannsburg, in whose building the mission seminary was originally based, is now a modern conference centre with a cafe, bookshop and \"One World Shop\". It houses an exhibition called \"Candace - Mission Possible\" to inform those interested about the work and worldwide network of the ELM.\n\n"}

It is between Ngoumou and Bipindi, in a zone of the Atlantic Littoral Evergreen Forest.\n\nIt is notable for being the home of Pygmy clans and their camp settlements and hunting areas, such as those of the Lala and Bakola clans. The Ngumba and Kwassio (speakers of Makaa–Njem languages) and Bagyeli tribes also reside in the area, the Bagyeli having been forced off their lands by the logging industry since the 1960s and the effect of the new oil pipeline since 1999. There are also settled Bantu peoples, who previously 'owned' pygmy clans.\n\nThe name of Lolodorf is German in origin, and relates to the name of a notable of Bikoui village, Loule-Dorf. In 1897 a Christian mission was opened in Lolodorf. Most of the people in the region are now Christians.\n\nThe Lokoundje River flows through Lolodorf, said to be \"\"narrow with fast moving water and numerous waterfalls\"\", and there is a temporary bridge over the river. Malaria and sleeping sickness are common problems in the humid climate, and there are a variety of natural remedies in which the Pygmy healers are expert.\n\nThe nearest market is at the coastal port & resort town of Kribi, and there is a dirt road to it from Lolodorf of about 110 km, usually taking around 6 hours.\n\nFarming, tapping palm wine, gathering fruits and nuts for food, and hunting are the main occupations. There are some cocoa plantations. Coffee was abandoned as a crop in the mid 1990s. There is said to be little river fishing. There is some limited tourism, arriving from Kribi; to see Pygmy camps, wildlife and local musicians.\n\nEight different languages are spoken in the town. There is a volunteer-run French radio station at Lolodorf that began broadcasting in 1997.\n\nThere has been a weather station in the town for more than 25 years.\n\nNearby villages are Saballi and Jalalli. There is a seminary at nearby Bibia which trains Presbyterian ministers.\n\nOil companies aim to run an important pipeline through the area, taking oil from Doba in Chad to an undersea terminal on the sea coast at Kribi. There is a $600,000 'Indigenous Peoples Plan' as compensation to local people, following an intensive study of the area's economy in 1999. Organisations such as Forest Peoples have concerns about the management and distribution of such aid.\n\nThere is thought to be some illegal mining of diamonds and gold in the area.\n\n"}

He was educated at Christ's Hospital, London and Clare College, Cambridge, where he was sixth wrangler in 1931. He sat the examinations of the Royal Statistical Society in 1932 and was awarded their Frances Wood Prize.\n\nClarke worked for the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association, 1932–33.

{"id": "1951338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951338", "title": "Upturned collar", "text": "Upturned collar\n\nAn upturned collar (or popped collar) is an otherwise flat, protruding collar of either a shirt, jacket, or coat that has been turned upward.\n\nBefore the early 20th century, most shirt collars were turned up in some manner. Men and women alike wore tall, stiff collars (as much as three inches tall), not unlike a taller version of a clerical collar, made either of starched linen, cotton, or lace. The writer H. G. Wells remarked in his 1902 book \"Kipps\" that these \"made [the] neck quite sore and left a red mark under [the] ears.\" Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, men's collars were often detachable from their shirts, connected only by two removable collar studs (one in front and one at the back). Detachable collars were very stiff, and either stood straight up (as in a Hamilton collar) or were pressed over at an ironed-in, starched crease (as in a Fremont collar). After World War II, mass-production gradually phased out detachable collars from ordinary dress shirts. Occasionally, one can still find detachable collar formal shirts, designed to be worn with a tuxedo or evening dress.\n\nLapels on jackets and coats, which resemble (and derive from) a longer collar, were and are also occasionally worn turned up. The frock coat of the 18th and 19th century often had a solid lapel that was always turned up. Gradually, toward the mid-to-late 19th century, however, lapels became folded down and \"pieced out,\" in the peak, notched, or shawl lapel that one sees to this day. Today, however, a jacket lapel's ability to be turned up helps to provide an extra modicum of warmth when weather is cold or windy.\n\nWith the advent of the tennis shirt, however, the upturned collar took on a whole new purpose. In 1929 René Lacoste, the French 7-time Grand Slam champion, decided that the stiff dress shirts and ties usually worn by tennis players were too cumbersome and uncomfortable for the tennis court. Instead, he designed a loosely-knit pique cotton shirt with an unstarched, flat protruding collar and a longer shirt-tail in back than in front. This came to be known as the tennis shirt. Lacoste's design called for a thick piqué collar that one would wear turned up in order to block the sun from one's neck skin. Thus, the tennis shirt's upturned collar was originally designed by the inventor of the tennis shirt, himself, for ease and comfort on the tennis court, aiding the player by helping to prevent sunburn.\n\nGradually, as tennis shirts became more popular and were produced more widely, their use transcended tennis and was adopted for golf, polo, other sports, and everyday life. As the tennis shirt entered the popular culture, wearers were less apt to turn up their collar to block the sun if not wearing the shirt during sport or outdoor activity. Thus, most people began to wear a tennis shirt without the collar turned up, or turning them up only when involved in sport. The professional golfer Fuzzy Zoeller is known for this practice today; as the golf shirt is a looser-fitting descendant of René Lacoste's tennis shirt, off the course Zoeller wears his golf shirt's collar turned down, whereas one often observes him with an upturned collar while he is playing.\n\nIn 1980, Lisa Birnbach published \"The Official Preppy Handbook\", in which she extolled the \"virtues of the upturned collar\". According to Ms. Birnbach, rather than being a sports innovation, the upturned collar on a tennis shirt was simply a signal that the wearer is a \"preppy\". Despite this obviously tongue-in-cheek characterization, Ms. Birnbach did correctly identify that one was more likely to view an upturned collar on the beaches of Nantucket than one would in middle America.\n\nThe book was a bestselling sensation. As a result, many people outside of the \"preppy\" enclaves of New England began emulating the style espoused in and categorized by Ms. Birnbach. As such, ordinary people in middle America who would not otherwise have done so began to wear the collars of their tennis shirts turned up as a popular culture trend, but not because of the collar's utilitarian purpose of blocking the sun. During the 1980s, many celebrities wore upturned collars. Joan Jett often upturned the collar of her leather jacket, as did Tiffany. Nevertheless, this style ultimately seemed to pass out of popular culture fashion by the middle of the 1990s.\n\nIn the early 2000s, however, the upturned collar has undergone a resurgence in popularity as a trend in the popular culture, particularly in the United States, where some people began to refer to it as a \"popped collar\". It also gained popularity as a trend in Europe (perhaps after football star Eric Cantona). Although the upturned collar no longer seems to be in vogue with the majority of European youth, older people still frequently wear upturned collars. Recently, certain Americans still perceive the upturned collar to be a \"preppy\" status symbol. This trend seems no longer to be limited to tennis shirts, as some people turn up the collars of shirts not designed to be worn that way.\nToday, some Americans regard the trend as having worn out, and thus the wearer of an upturned collar can be the object of mockery and scorn. Still, others continue to turn up their collars as a popular culture fashion. This has been bolstered by publicity from retailers with a middle-class clientele, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters (although Abercrombie & Fitch company styling requirements for the 2006 Holiday floorset officially said that their workers should not be turning their collars up).\n\nThe upturned collar fashion has remained relatively popular over the years and decades, by celebrities who occasionally and sometimes frequently wear their shirts this way. This includes celebrities such as Jane Fonda, Goldie Hawn, Sharon Stone, Kanye West, Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, Diane Sawyer, Suze Orman, Wendie Malick, and Morgan Pressel (pictured above right), and Aishwarya Rai.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951344", "title": "Castle of Guimarães", "text": "Castle of Guimarães\n\nThe Castle of Guimarães (), is the principal medieval castle in the municipality Guimarães, in the northern region of Portugal. It was built under the orders of Mumadona Dias in the 10th century to defend the monastery from attacks by Moors and Norsemen.\n\nThe castle is a military fortification grounded primarily in the late Romanesque period, and elaborated during the early Gothic epoch of Portuguese architecture. Its area is delineated by walls forming a pentagram, similar to a shield, that includes eight rectangular towers, military square and central keep. Originating in the foundations of a Roman structure, from the writings of Alfredo Guimarães, it was later elaborated on the French model, in its current the form of a shield, with reduced central yard and difficult accesses. It includes several Gothic characteristics, owing to its remodelling at the end of the 13th century, when the keep and residences were constructed (possibly over pre-existing structures).\n\nEmblematic of the medieval Portuguese castle, Guimarães is associated with the origins of the Portuguese nation. Yet, the phases and organization involved in its construction, from the 10th century onwards is very deficient, with many of its present structure resulting from its reconstruction in the second half of the 13th century. The examination of its walls and remains led Carlos A.F. de Almeida to proclaim, for example, that the flanking towers were constructed during the late Romanesque, early Gothic period.\n\nIn the second half of the 10th century, owing to the death of Count Hermenegildo Gonçalves, the property of Vimaranes (today Guimarães) was inherited by his daughter Oneca. Countess Mumadona Dias, the count's widow, traded her property in Creiximir for the land in Vimaranes, and ordered the construction of a monastery situated on land today occupied by the Collegiate and Church of Nossa Senhora da Oliveira (PT010308340007). Later, in order to defend the curate at the monastery, the countess ordered the construction of the castle. By 4 December 968, a codicilar document, the countess referred to the castle (then designated as the Castle of São Mamede) as just having been constructed, in order to defend the friars and nuns in the monastery.\n\nAt the end of the 10th century, Dias's eldest son, Gonçalo Mendes, takes possession of the lands following her death and maintaining her wishes to support the monastery. But, Gonçalo Muniuz, son of Múnio (fourth son of Mumadona Dias) attempted to seize the town and castle, but he was impeded by his uncle Gonçalo, then family patriarch. These family squabbles continued, when Ordonho Ramírez, great-grandson of Mumadona, took the castle and town, later bequeathing them to his daughter Mumadona, on her marriage to Fernando Gundemáriz, son of Gundemaro Pinióliz. The town and castle were eventually sold to Gontrode Ordonhes, the other daughter of Ordonho Ramírez and sister-in-law of Fernando Gundemáriz who was married to Mendo Folienz, who eventually donated the monastery in 1045 to the curate.\n\nAt the end of the 11th century the castle was heavily expanded and remodeled, under the direction of Count Henry, to act as his residence. The vestiges of the work are found near the entrance, and includes consisting of five rows of large ashlars, defining an arched wall, that were part of bastion between granite outcrops, within a castle with walled courtyard. The fortress, then over a century old, needed renovation. The nobleman chose to destroy what remained from Mumadona's construction, while extending the area of the castle and adding two entrances. The castle became the official royal residence from 1139, when Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of León, until circa 1200. It was at this residence that Afonso Henriques was born in 1111, living his life in the castle, which became the residence of the Counts of Portucale.\n\nFollowing years of family rivalries, in 1128, the Battle of São Mamede (fought within the fields of the same name) gave origin to the independence of Portucale and the formation of the nucleus of what would become Portugal.\n\nBetween the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, the castle was remodelled by King Denis, resulting in the form that stands to this day. The alcalde Mem Martins de Vasconcelos, siding with the king, resisted the siege by the Infante D. Afonso. In 1369, King Henry II of Castile invaded Portugal and encircled the castle of Guimarães, but was defeated by its population and forces loyal to then-alcaide Gonçalo Pais de Meira. Yet, several years (1385) King John I encircled the castle, and it was the alcaide Aires Gomes da Silva, supporter of Beatriz, who defended its walls. Sometime between 1383 and 1433, the two towers that flank the main entrance were order built by King John I of Portugal.\n\nIn 1653, the town prosecutors of Guimarães within the Cortes petitioned \"\"it was worth the village castle, the most sumptuous of the kingdom, which is becoming ruined, and if care is not taken, will become completely ruined, at the cost of the alcalde's rents. And the walls, also the best in the kingdom, if they are not repaired, will fall into ruin, equally the two towers without a little repair.\"\" Yet, by 1793, Alberto Vieira Braga referred to the \"\"inutility\"\" of the walls that circled the town, owing to their state of ruin. This changes marked the slow decline of the structure as a defense fortification.\n\nBy 1836, the councilmen of Guimarães were already looking to demolition the castle, and reuse the stone to repave the roadways. A member of the \"Sociedade Patriótica Vimaranense\" (\"Patriotic Society of Guimarães\") defended the demolition of the castle, and suggested the use of its stones to pave the streets of Guimarães, as the fortress had been used as a political prison during the reign of King Miguel. However, this was never accepted. 45 years later, on 19 March 1881, the \"Diário do Governo\" (Official Journal) listed the Guimarães Castle as the most unusual historic monument of the whole region of Minho. After the castle's demolition was abandoned in the 19th century, many of the houses, estates and lodgings around the castle were expropriated.\n\nThe first attempts at restoration occurred during the mid-20th century, specifically in 1936. In 1910, the castle was declared a national monument. In 1937, the General Service for National Buildings and Monuments started its restorations. The structure was re-inaugurated on 4 June 1940, on the occasion of the centenary of the castle.\n\nOn 20 April 1952, a special protection zone was established that included the castle, Church of São Miguel and the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza. Further elaboration of a plan for the area was completed within the 1957 landscaping of the area around the chapel by Viana Barreto.\n\nIn the course of installing new electrical systems at the castle, a medieval well was discovered.\n\nOn 1 June 1992, the building became the property of the Instituto Português do Património Arquitetónico (IPPA), under decree 106F/92 (Diário da República, Série 1A, 126). Further excavations in 2004, in the castle interior allowed the dating of structures to 10th century.\n\nThe castle is located within the northern limits of the urban area of Guimarães, isolated on a small hill formed from granite, and encircled by a small forest park, accessed by several pedestrian trails. Alongside the southern tower is a bronze medallion of D. Afonso Henriques, over a large rock. In the vicinity, on the hillside, is the Romanesque church of São Miguel do Castelo (PT010308340006) and the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza (PT010308340013) and some sections of wall (PT010308340016) that surrounded the city, and that were originally integrated into the castle.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951356", "title": "Samuel Smith Old Brewery", "text": "Samuel Smith Old Brewery\n\nSamuel Smith's Old Brewery, popularly known as Samuel Smith's or Sam Smith's, is an independent English brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England. It is Yorkshire's oldest brewery, founded in 1758.\n\nThe Old Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in the North of England, was established in 1758. Samuel Smith, a successful butcher and cattle dealer from Meanwood, Leeds, funded his son John to buy it from the Hartley family in 1847. John Smith took over the brewery forming John Smith's Brewery, before moving his location next door. John Smith left the old building of John Smith's Brewery to his young nephew Samuel in 1886. In 1886 Samuel Smith opened the brewery Samuel Smith's Brewery under his own name.\n\nSamuel Smith beers in bottled form were a major influence on American craft brewers such as Goose Island and Brooklyn Brewery in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe Old Brewery at Tadcaster was founded in 1758 and bears the name of local brewer Samuel Smith. It is both the oldest brewery in Yorkshire and the only surviving independent brewery in Tadcaster. The smallest of the three modern-day Tadcaster breweries, Sam Smith's is one of the few remaining British breweries to employ the traditional Yorkshire Square system in the production of its beers.\n\nBrewing water for ales and stouts is still drawn from the original well, sunk when the site was established in 1758, and the yeast used in the fermentation process is of a strain that has been used continuously since approximately 1900—one of the oldest unchanged strains in the country. In keeping with this sense of history and tradition, the brewery keeps a small team of dapple-grey shire horses. Rather than being show horses, they are among the last active dray horses in the world. They deliver beer around the town of Tadcaster five days a week. The brewery site has expanded over the years and is divided by Centre Lane. New Street separates it from the adjacent John Smith's Brewery.\n\nSince discontinuing Museum Ale in the early 1990s, Sam Smith's have brewed only one cask beer, Old Brewery Bitter (OBB). This is unique in the British brewing industry, as most brewers will either produce a range of real ales or none at all.\n\nThey also produce a range of brewery-conditioned beers. All their beers, with the exception of the Old Brewery Bitter and Yorkshire Stingo, are vegan. In addition, most of Samuel Smith's beers—some notable exceptions being the Oatmeal Stout, Wheat Beer, Yorkshire Stingo, and Organic Cherry Fruit Beer—are brewed solely with malt, hops, yeast and water.\n\nIn the United States, Samuel Smith's bottled beers are imported by Merchant du Vin. In Norway, the beers are imported by Strag AS. The beers are also sold in certain places in Northern Ireland. Samuel Smith's Organic Cider is available in bottles, while Cider Reserve is sold on draught solely in the UK. The brewery offers two draught milds, Dark Mild and Light Mild. Most pubs will offer only one variant. The brewery used to produce a super strength Barley Wine called Strong Golden at 10.2%. A range of bottled fruit beers are available, flavoured with cherry, apricot or raspberry.\n\nIn recent years, the brewery have altered their product line-up, dispensing with Tadcaster Bitter but introducing Best Bitter. Best Bitter and Sovereign are the brewery's only keg bitters. They introduced Double Four in late 2013, a 4% strength lager aimed at providing a standard strength lager to bridge the gap between Alpine (2.8%) and Taddy Lager (4.5%). A wheat beer has been added to the draught product range, although few pubs stock it. Until 2006 Samuel Smith's used the brand name Ayingerbräu for its lagers and wheat beers, using the name and logo of German brewery, Brauerei Aying. The brand was best known for its 'man-in-a-box' pump for Ayingerbräu Lager, which featured a model Bavarian man inside a plastic box.\n\nAyingerbräu Lager gained a cult following in some parts of the UK and a beer drinking challenge is held annually. In 2006 Ayingerbräu Lager reverted to Alpine Lager, its original name in the 1960s. In late 2005 production of both the Ayingerbräu D Pils and Prinz Lager brands ceased. These have been replaced by Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager. Later on the brewery swapped the strength of their brand names, with Alpine lager becoming 2.8% and Taddy becoming 4.5%. Pure Brew Lager and previously Ayingerbräu are served from a tall cylindric shaped pump which stands out from all the other keg product lines which are served from the standard small box shaped pump. Despite the cylindric pump being taller, the tap is still at bar level (modern taps are usually at eye level).\n\nThe brewery operates over 200 pubs, which are notable for their independence: The beers are all produced by the Tadcaster brewery and no large corporation spirits or soft drinks are available. In 2000, Samuel Smith's began phasing out the branding from their pubs, and in November 2004, the company took the decision to ban music in its pubs, which saves paying Performing Rights levy.\n\nSamuel Smith's pubs are found in a variety of locations, including rural, suburban, inner-city and city-centre ones. There are over 20 pubs in central London. Irrespective of the location, the pubs are maintained in a traditional manner. Most pubs incorporate multiple bars and rooms, often with a spartan public bar and a more plush lounge. Samuel Smith's still delivers multiple-trip (re-usable) bottles in beer crates. In 2007 the company began to sell frozen meals made by Sarah Brownridge in their pubs. Then, in 2008, all franchise pubs were switched to 'company catering'. The brewery now have centrally determined set menus from which the individual pub can select offerings to create its menu. All portion sizes and serving practice are set by the brewery. Further to the company phasing out brands from their pubs, all pubs now sell Samuel Smith's branded crisps: Salted, Cheese and Onion, Salt and Vinegar and Roast Beef flavours are offered. Further to this, the company offers salted, dry roasted or chili peanuts, pork scratchings or cheese biscuits, again all sold under the Samuel Smith's Old Brewery brand name, cheese biscuits have since been removed from the product range and Sweet Chili hand cooked crisps were introduced. Samuel Smith's public houses are distinctive in their plain appearance with limited signage or artwork. Previously pubs could be noted by gold on black signage with the company logo, however the company have adopted a policy of not displaying the brewery name on their pubs.\n\nIn 2019 the brewery introduced rules banning the use of mobile telephones, tablets and laptops within the indoor area of their pubs with the aim of removing activities which discouraged conversation.\n\nMost of the Samuel Smiths pubs are traditional in their layout and decoration. Many have multiple rooms, most have a lounge and a tap room. Most Samuel Smiths pubs have traditional frosted windows for privacy; many decorated with stained glass. The interiors are often characterised with having either brown or beige walls or elaborate wall paper. Some have notable furniture such as the Crown Inn in Wetherby which has furniture by Robert Thompson or the Princess Louise in High Holborn with its unique booths around the bar.\n\nThe GMB trade union has criticised the company for its treatment of pub managers, resulting in a number of court cases. Humphrey Smith has also pursued a number of planning application objections at the cost of Selby district council. In October 2010, it was reported that the brewery was taking legal action against Cropton Brewery over the use of the Yorkshire white rose design. Cropton Brewery released a beer named Yorkshire Warrior, celebrating the Yorkshire Regiment. The proceeds of the beer's sales go directly to the regimental benevolent fund for wounded soldiers. In a decision from the court, Cropton was ordered to remove the white rose emblem from their Yorkshire Warrior brand, but the judge criticised both breweries for taking the case so far through the legal system and not settling the issue sooner. \n\nOn New Year's Eve 2011, Humphrey Smith closed the Junction Inn in Royton because the landlords were dispensing too much beer in their pints and subsequently issued a retrospective surcharge of £10,733 for lost stock over a 12-year period. In January 2016, Samuel Smith's Old Brewery opposed the construction of a temporary bridge over the River Wharfe, which would allow residents to cross the town, which was divided following the collapse of the 300-year-old bridge, claiming that, at a cost of £300,000, it was \"a waste of public money\". In July 2017, Samuel Smith's Brewery banned motorcyclists from one of their pubs. Initially no explanation was offered for the ban. It was later reported that the ban was instituted to keep \"undesirables\" from patronising the establishment. Local, long-term customers who were refused entry because they owned motorcycles, were offended by notion of being compared to criminal motorcycle gangs. The affected customers reportedly have no legal recourse as \"bikers were not a 'protected group' under the Equality Act.\" In October 2017, the brewery issued a chain-wide ban on the use of profanity in its pubs. The \"zero-tolerance\" policy calls for employees to cut off service to customers who use offensive language. It was reported that this policy, along with recent bans of groups identified as \"undesirable\" or potentially \"rowdy\" due to certain types of clothing worn, is part of a \"traditional, \"uncompromisingly Victorian\" aesthetic\" that the brewery tries to maintain in its pubs, which includes an absence of music and televisions. In 2019, Humphrey Smith shut down one pub after visiting and overhearing a customer swearing.\n\n\n\n"}

However, in early 1970, he fired them; as he later told a friend, \"Those boys could fuck up a crowbar in fifteen seconds.\" They recorded their first album in 1970, called \"Official Music\", as \"King Biscuit Boy and Crowbar\". King Biscuit Boy left the band later in 1970 but continued to appear off and on as a guest performer.\n\nIn 1971, the band recorded a performance at Massey Hall, in Toronto, which was released as a double album, \"Larger than Life (and Live'r Than You've Ever Been)\". The concert, billed as \"An Evening of Love with Daffodil Records\", was co-produced by concert promoter Martin Onrot and Toronto radio station CHUM-FM. Numerous guests appeared with Crowbar at Massey Hall, including members of Lighthouse, Dr. Music, and Everyday People. King Biscuit Boy also returned to perform with his former bandmates. The recording and release of the album are significant as being the first time a Canadian band had recorded and released a \"live in concert\" album. It was also the first time that a live concert was broadcast simultaneous on Chum FM.\n\nAlso in 1971, the band performed a concert in the Lord Beaverbrook Grand Ballroom in New Brunswick and entertained at the anniversary celebrations in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nDue largely to Margaret Trudeau's enthusiasm for the band, Crowbar was featured as the opening act of Pierre Trudeau's 1972 re-election campaign rallies, including a notable stop at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. This association enhanced the band's reputation in Canada and garnered international interest from agencies such as A&M Records and figures such as Clive Davis. Despite this momentum, their second album did not capture the energy of their first and the band faltered.\n\nCrowbar disbanded in 1975 but was revived in 1977, without Jozef Chirowski, who had joined Alice Cooper's band. The band performed intermittently during the 1980s.\n\nMore recently, Crowbar played shows around Hamilton, Ontario, including a performance at their induction into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nThe band consisted of numerous players in various combinations over its lifetime, including:\n\nTrack Listing\n\nPersonnel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He had previously been an acquaintance of Pynoo's sister who had photographed Els naked and had later showed the picture to Mommens. As Els stated in a 2005 interview; Mommens had approached her in a normal fashion and said randomly: \"Hey I saw you naked!\" Mommen's recorded a few demos with Pynoo on his 8-track recorder. These demos were released on the EP \"Je ne veux pas\" (sometimes also referred to as \"Paris\") which gathered some attention for its resemblance to '80s new wave music. Their first success came with their debut \"Attaque Surprise\" (2000). Later records such as \"République Populaire\" (2001) and \"Nuit Blanche\" (2003) made them popular, especially in the fashion world, where Karl Lagerfeld is one of their fans, and has enlisted them to perform at a number of his big shows in New York City and Paris.

{"id": "1951385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951385", "title": "Yorman Bazardo", "text": "Yorman Bazardo\n\nYorman Michael Bazardo Osorio (born July 11, 1984) is a Venezuelan former right-handed pitcher. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers and Houston Astros.\n\nGrowing up, Bazardo played in Venezuelan youth leagues, where one of his competitors was future teammate (on two different MLB clubs) Miguel Cabrera. Bazardo got his break in 2000, when the Florida Marlins signed him as an undrafted free agent. His first season in the organization was in 2001, when he played for the now-defunct VSL Marlins in the Venezuelan Summer League, going 7–2 with a 2.43 earned run average (ERA). The Marlins moved him up to the single-A Jamestown Jammers in 2002, where he posted a 5–0 record with a 2.72 ERA and six saves. In 2003, he was promoted to the single-A Greensboro Bats and used primarily as a starting pitcher. Although he had a mixed record (9–8) his ERA remained a low 3.12. Typical was a game in August against the Hagerstown Suns in which he allowed just two runs over eight innings in a 2–0 loss.\n\n2004 found Bazardo with the single-A Jupiter Hammerheads, where he went 5–9 with a 3.27 ERA; again, he suffered from a lack of run support and frequent errors which allowed unearned runs to score. At the end of the year the Marlins added Bazardo to their 40-man roster. A further sign of the Marlins confidence came in 2005, when Bazardo was invited to spring training, although he did not make the cut and was optioned to the double-A Carolina Mudcats. On May 26, 2005, Bazardo was called up by the Marlins to replace struggling relief pitcher Logan Kensing. Marlins manager Jack McKeon acknowledged that it was something of a gamble: \"Who's to say he's not another Willis? Let's find out. Let's see if he can handle the situation. Some can't. Some can.\" Bazardo was rocked in his one relief appearance; giving up five runs (four of them earned) in 1 innings, and the next day he was optioned to Carolina.\n\nBazardo stayed with the Mudcats through the end of July, going 8–7 with a 3.99 ERA, when he was traded with Mike Flannery to the Seattle Mariners for Ron Villone.\n\nThe Mariners assigned Bazardo to the Double-A San Antonio Missions where he went 3–1 with a 4.28 ERA. In 2006, he was named Missions pitcher of the year after going 6–5 with a 3.64 ERA in 25 starts. He was also named to the Texas League post season all-star team. Over the winter Bazardo played in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he was 2–0 with a 1.78, and threw six shutout innings in the Caribbean World Series. The Mariners added Bazardo to their 40-man roster, but designated him for assignment after acquiring veteran pitcher Jeff Weaver. Rather than lose him outright, the Mariners traded Bazardo to the Detroit Tigers for outfielder Jeff Frazier on February 7, 2007.\n\nThe Tigers sent Bazardo to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens where he spent most of the 2007 season, posting a 10–6 record with an ERA of 3.75. Bazardo was called up several times in 2007 to fill in for the injury-plagued Tigers, cobbling together a 2–1 record with a 2.38 ERA in 11 appearances.\n\nBazardo began the 2008 season with the Tigers, but was designated for assignment after giving up eight runs over three innings in three appearances. After clearing waivers Bazardo rejoined the Mud Hens. He became a free agent at the end of the season.\n\nIn December 2008, Bazardo signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was subsequently released by the organization in April 2009.\n\nOn January 7, 2009, Bazardo signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros. Assigned to their AAA affiliate, the Round Rock Express, Bazardo was named a Pacific Coast League midseason All-Star. On August 8, the Astros purchased Bazardo's contract, and he pitched in ten games for Houston through the end of the season, making six starts. He pitched in the minors for Houston in 2010 before becoming a free agent.\n\nOn November 14, 2010, Bazardo signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins. He was released on June 16, 2011.\n\nHe was selected to the roster for the Venezuela national baseball team at the 2015 WBSC Premier12.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951400", "title": "Dr. Dog", "text": "Dr. Dog\n\nDr. Dog is an American rock band based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Its lineup consists of Toby Leaman (bass guitar), Scott McMicken (lead guitar), Frank McElroy (rhythm guitar), Zach Miller (keyboard), and Eric Slick (drums). Lead vocal duties are shared between Leaman and McMicken, with all members contributing harmonies. In addition, each band member has a nickname beginning with the letter T, and they have explained that friends of the band also receive nicknames, which are drawn from aspects of their lives and personalities. (Former member Andrew \"Trial\" Jones, for example, is a licensed attorney.)\n\nThe band's musical styling of indie rock is strongly influenced by bands of the 1960s, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, but they have also touched upon more unrelated genres since their inception. Their earlier recordings show influence of the lo-fi sound and pop sensibilities of indie rock bands of the 1990s, such as Guided by Voices and Pavement, although recent albums have featured more polished production.\n\nThe origins of Dr. Dog trace back to Leaman and McMicken first playing music together in eighth grade. The two never played covers, instead, opting to write all of their own music. The band began as an offshoot of Leaman's and McMicken's earlier music project, during college at West Chester University, PA, called Raccoon. Dr. Dog formed with the addition of Miller, drummer Ted Mark, and guitarist Doug O'Donnell also while attending West Chester. Their early recordings were experimental and recorded on eight track. They self-recorded and self-released their first album \"The Psychedelic Swamp\" in 2001. Starting in 2002, Leaman, McMicken, and O'Donnell regularly played bluegrass with friends at the London Grill in the Fairmount Section of Philadelphia under the pseudonym \"Conowingo Homeboys\". Meanwhile, Leaman and O'Donnell split time in both Dr. Dog and another band, Doublehorse! They released \"Toothbrush\" in 2002. Mark left the band in 2003 and O'Donnell left in 2004. Juston Stens replaced Ted Mark on drums. The band's early years were spent largely in Philadelphia where they developed a small but dedicated fanbase touring with other local bands such as The Teeth.\n\nIn 2004, My Morning Jacket invited them on two tours after a copy of \"Toothbrush\" was given to Jim James after a My Morning Jacket show. Soon after, \"The New York Times\" music critic Kelefa Sanneh praised the group's album \"Easy Beat\" in a December 2004 article, leading to attention from other critics. They signed with Park The Van Records, who released the album \"Easy Beat\", and completed their first cross-country tour in 2005. A music video was released for the song \"Fool's Life\". Late 2005 saw the departure of Jones, who became a full-time lawyer. Jones was replaced by Frank McElroy, a friend of Stens from New Jersey. The band continued to tour heavily as their popularity grew, due in part to their use of the internet to promote their growing catalog.\n\nBy 2006, Dr. Dog started using a new studio as well as new recording equipment. Philadelphia engineer/producer Bill Moriarty, who they share the studio with, is credited in helping the members use this new equipment to create particular sounds they wanted in their new recordings due to his vast knowledge in recording tools and methods. That year, they released the \"Takers and Leavers\" EP. Two of the tracks on the EP would later be released on their next album. In 2007, they released \"We All Belong\", which has a markedly cleaner production compared to earlier albums. They appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" in support of the album.\n\nThrough the late summer of 2007, Dr. Dog streamed ten unreleased tracks on their website, with a new song debuting weekly. Songs were posted each Monday from July 2 until September 3. These recordings were later released as an album titled \"Passed Away, Vol. 1\". In 2008, the band released \"Fate\". They appeared again on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" on July 17, 2008, in support of the album and on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" on April 2, 2009 as well as \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". The band went on tour with The Cave Singers and label-mates Golden Boots.\n\nOn July 29, 2009, Dr. Dog signed to ANTI- Records. The first album on their new label, titled \"Shame, Shame\", was released on April 6, 2010. Scott McMicken characterized the album as more modern, and a little more punk rock, more prominently featuring electric guitars, so as to accurately reflect the band's live show. In early 2010, Eric Slick replaced Juston Stens on drums for the Shame, Shame tours although Stens plays most of the drums on the record. Stens continues to make music with Juston Stens and the Get Real Gang. Dr. Dog toured in support of Shame, Shame for about two years and performed again on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". For 2010's Black Friday Record Store Day, the band released a limited red and blue 7\" collection of four tracks recorded in summer 2011. These were the first songs recorded with Eric Slick on drums. They were later rereleased with \"Shame, Shame\" as a deluxe edition of the album.\n\nOn October 26, 2011, McMicken announced that their new album, \"Be the Void\" would be released in February 2012. Recorded at the band's \"Meth Beach\" studio and co-produced by Nathan Sabatino of Golden Boots. This was the first full album made with Dimitri Manos, also in the band Golden Boots, as an official member of the band. He played drums on \"Easy Beat\" and once filled in for Juston Stens last minute for a whole tour. They released a new 7\" on a variety of colors for the November 2011 Record Store Day including the tracks \"Warrior Man\" and \"Control Yourself\" which would appear on \"Be The Void\". On January 31, 2012, \"Be The Void\" was first available to be streamed on Conan O'Brien's website one week before its official release. It was officially released on February 7 on ANTI- Records. They performed the song \"That Old Black Hole\" on \"Conan\", February 8 and \"Lonesome\" on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", on March 23. Performances in Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre during their tour were also shown on \"Last Call with Carson Daly\".\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Dr. Dog announced on their Facebook page that their new EP, \"Wild Race\", would be released digitally on October 2. The EP was recorded and mixed with Nathan Sabatino during the sessions for \"Be the Void\".\n\nOn July 22, 2013 the band announced their next album, \"B-Room\" and the lead single \"The Truth\". To record the album the band built an all-new studio in February 2013 in Clifton Heights, PA nicknamed \"Mount Slippery. All songs were tracked live in the room that eventually led to the album's name. \"B-Room\" was released on October 1, 2013 after streaming for free for one week on \"Rolling Stone\"'s\" website. The album received generally positive reviews.\n\nDr. Dog's first live album, \"Live at a Flamingo Hotel\" became available of January 13, 2015. The album was assembled from performances over 20 concerts during the \"B-Room\" tour.\n\nIn September 2015, Leaman revealed that the band has revisited 2001's \"Psychedelic Swamp\", and the album would finally get an official release in 2016. He told Kelly Rae Smith of the Charleston City Paper, \"It's actually weird working on that stuff, because you know usually when you're working on a record — or almost always when you're working on a record — you're working on new tunes. And with this one, we're working on the oldest Dr. Dog tunes around. It's really interesting. You're almost treating your own songs like they're cover songs, and it's songs that we didn't even really play live, so we didn't have any real concept of what the arrangement would end up being like.\" The album \"The Psychedelic Swamp\" was released on February 5, 2016 on the ANTI- label and was produced by Nathan Sabatino.\n\nOn November 29, 2016 Dr. Dog dropped a surprise album on Bandcamp titled \"Abandoned Mansion.\" The album was made available to stream for free and all proceeds received through January 31, 2017 would benefit the Southern Poverty Law Center. The album was released on the band's new label We Buy Gold Records as they previously ended their relationship with ANTI- over the priorities of \"Abandoned Mansion\" against \"Psychedelic Swamp\". The band did not tour in support of \"Mansion\" and took a brief hiatus.\n\nOn January 3, 2018 the band teased their new album titled \"Critical Equation\" on their website and on Twitter. The album was officially announced for an April 27, 2018 release on the We Buy Gold label releasing via Thirty Tigers. Press and reviews for \"Critical Equation\" was generally positive. On February 8, 2019 the band released \"Critical 7\"\" featuring two songs from the \"Critical Equation\" sessions.\n\nCurrent members\n\n\nPast members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The most prominent example is the liquid-vapor critical point, the end point of the pressure-temperature curve that designates conditions under which a liquid and its vapor can coexist. At higher temperatures, the gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. At the critical point, defined by a \"critical temperature\" \"T\" and a \"critical pressure\" \"p\", phase boundaries vanish. Other examples include the liquid–liquid critical points in mixtures.\n\nFor simplicity and clarity, the generic notion of \"critical point\" is best introduced by discussing a specific example, the liquid-vapor critical point. This was the first critical point to be discovered, and it is still the best known and most studied one.\n\nThe figure to the right shows the schematic PT diagram of a \"pure substance\" (as opposed to mixtures, which have additional state variables and richer phase diagrams, discussed below). The commonly known phases \"solid\", \"liquid\" and \"vapor\" are separated by phase boundaries, i.e. pressure-temperature combinations where two phases can coexist. At the triple point, all three phases can coexist. However, the liquid-vapor boundary terminates in an endpoint at some \"critical temperature\" \"T\" and \"critical pressure\" \"p\". This is the \"critical point\".\n\nIn water, the critical point occurs at and .\n\nIn the \"vicinity\" of the critical point, the physical properties of the liquid and the vapor change dramatically, with both phases becoming ever more similar. For instance, liquid water under normal conditions is nearly incompressible, has a low thermal expansion coefficient, has a high dielectric constant, and is an excellent solvent for electrolytes. Near the critical point, all these properties change into the exact opposite: water becomes compressible, expandable, a poor dielectric, a bad solvent for electrolytes, and prefers to mix with nonpolar gases and organic molecules.\n\n\"At\" the critical point, only one phase exists. The heat of vaporization is zero. There is a stationary inflection point in the constant-temperature line (\"critical isotherm\") on a PV diagram. This means that at the critical point:\n\n\"Above\" the critical point there exists a state of matter that is continuously connected with (can be transformed without phase transition into) both the liquid and the gaseous state. It is called supercritical fluid. The common textbook knowledge that all distinction between liquid and vapor disappears beyond the critical point has been challenged by Fisher and Widom who identified a p,T-line that separates states with different asymptotic statistical properties (Fisher-Widom line).\n\nThe existence of a critical point was first discovered by Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1822 and named by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1860 and Thomas Andrews in 1869. Cagniard showed that CO could be liquefied at 31 °C at a pressure of 73 atm, but not at a slightly higher temperature, even under pressures as high as 3,000 atm.\n\nSolving the above condition formula_3 for the van der Waals equation, one can compute the critical point as \nHowever, the van der Waals equation, based on a mean field theory, does not hold near the critical point. In particular, it predicts wrong scaling laws.\n\nTo analyse properties of fluids near the critical point, reduced state variables are sometimes defined relative to the critical properties\n\nThe principle of corresponding states indicates that substances at equal reduced pressures and temperatures have equal reduced volumes. This relationship is approximately true for many substances, but becomes increasingly inaccurate for large values of \"p\".\n\nFor some gases, there is an additional correction factor, called \"Newton's correction\", added to the critical temperature and critical pressure calculated in this manner. These are empirically derived values and vary with the pressure range of interest.\n\nThe liquid–liquid critical point of a solution, which occurs at the \"critical solution temperature\", occurs at the limit of the two-phase region of the phase diagram. In other words, it is the point at which an infinitesimal change in some thermodynamic variable (such as temperature or pressure) will lead to separation of the mixture into two distinct liquid phases, as shown in the polymer–solvent phase diagram to the right. Two types of liquid–liquid critical points are the upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which is the hottest point at which cooling will induce phase separation, and the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the coldest point at which heating will induce phase separation.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, the liquid–liquid critical point represents the temperature-concentration extremum of the spinodal curve (as can be seen in the figure to the right). Thus, the liquid–liquid critical point in a two-component system must satisfy two conditions: the condition of the spinodal curve (the \"second\" derivative of the free energy with respect to concentration must equal zero), and the extremum condition (the \"third\" derivative of the free energy with respect to concentration must also equal zero or the derivative of the spinodal temperature with respect to concentration must equal zero).\n\n"}
{"id": "1951424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951424", "title": "Critical point (mathematics)", "text": "Critical point (mathematics)\n\nCritical point is a wide term used in many branches of mathematics.\n\nWhen dealing with functions of a real variable, a critical point is a point in the domain of the function where the function is either not differentiable or the derivative is equal to zero. When dealing with complex variables, a critical point is, similarly, a point in the function's domain where it is either not holomorphic or the derivative is equal to zero. Likewise, for a function of several real variables, a critical point is a value in its domain where the gradient is undefined or is equal to zero.\n\nThe value of the function at a critical point is a critical value.\n\nThis sort of definition extends to differentiable maps between R and R, a critical point being, in this case, a point where the rank of the Jacobian matrix is not maximal. It extends further to differentiable maps between differentiable manifolds, as the points where the rank of the Jacobian matrix decreases. In this case, critical points are also called \"bifurcation points\".\n\nIn particular, if \"C\" is a plane curve, defined by an implicit equation \"f\"(\"x\",\"y\") = 0, the critical points of the projection onto the \"x\"-axis, parallel to the \"y\"-axis are the points where the tangent to \"C\" are parallel to the \"y\"-axis, that is the points where formula_1. In other words, the critical points are those where the implicit function theorem does not apply.\n\nThe notion of a \"critical point\" allows the mathematical description of an astronomical phenomenon that was unexplained before the time of Copernicus. A stationary point in the orbit of a planet is a point of the trajectory of the planet on the celestial sphere, where the motion of the planet seems to stop before restarting in the other direction. This occurs because of a critical point of the projection of the orbit into the ecliptic circle.\n\nA critical point of a function of a single real variable, \"f\"(\"x\"), is a value \"x\" in the domain of \"f\" where it is not differentiable or its derivative is 0 (\"f\" ′(\"x\") = 0). A critical value is the image under \"f\" of a critical point. These concepts may be visualized through the graph of \"f\": at a critical point, the graph has a horizontal tangent if you can assign one at all.\n\nNotice how, for a differentiable function, \"critical point\" is the same as stationary point.\n\nAlthough it is easily visualized on the graph (which is a curve), the notion of critical point of a function must not be confused with the notion of critical point, in some direction, of a curve (see below for a detailed definition). If \"g\"(\"x\",\"y\") is a differentiable function of two variables, then \"g\"(\"x\",\"y\") = 0 is the implicit equation of a curve. A critical point of such a curve, for the projection parallel to the \"y\"-axis (the map (\"x\", \"y\") → \"x\"), is a point of the curve where formula_2. This means that the tangent of the curve is parallel to the \"y\"-axis, and that, at this point, \"g\" does not define an implicit function from \"x\" to \"y\" (see implicit function theorem). If (\"x\", \"y\") is such a critical point, then \"x\" is the corresponding critical value. Such a critical point is also called a bifurcation point, as, generally, when \"x\" varies, there are two branches of the curve on a side of \"x\" and zero on the other side.\n\nIt follows from these definitions that a differentiable function \"f\"(\"x\") has a critical point \"x\" with critical value \"y\", if and only if (\"x\", \"y\") is a critical point of its graph for the projection parallel to the \"x\"-axis, with the same critical value \"y.\" If \"f\" is not differentiable at x due to the tangent becoming parallel to the y-axis, then x is again a critical point of \"f\", but now (x, y) is a critical point of its graph for the projection parallel to \"y\"-axis.\n\nFor example, the critical points of the unit circle of equation \"x\" + \"y\" - 1 = 0 are (0, 1) and (0, -1) for the projection parallel to the \"x\"-axis, and (1, 0) and (-1, 0) for the direction parallel to the \"y\"-axis. If one considers the upper half circle as the graph of the function formula_3, then \"x\" = 0 is a critical point with critical value 1 due to the derivative being equal to 0, and x=-1 and x=1 are critical points with critical value 0 due to the derivative being undefined.\n\n\nBy the Gauss-Lucas theorem, all of a polynomial function's critical points in the complex plane are within the convex hull of the roots of the function. Thus for a polynomial function with only real roots, all critical points are real and are between the greatest and smallest roots.\n\nSendov's conjecture asserts that, if all of a function's roots lie in the unit disk in the complex plane, then there is at least one critical point within unit distance of any given root.\n\nCritical points play an important role in the study of plane curves defined by implicit equations, in particular for sketching them and determining their topology. The notion of critical point that is used in this section, may seem different from that of previous section. In fact it is the specialization to a simple case of the general notion of critical point given below.\n\nThus, we consider a curve defined by an implicit equation formula_4, where is a differentiable function of two variables, commonly a bivariate polynomial. The points of the curve are the points of the Euclidean plane whose Cartesian coordinates satisfy the equation. There are two standard projections formula_5 and formula_6, defined by formula_7 and formula_8 that map the curve onto the coordinate axes. They are called the \"projection parallel to the y-axis\" and the \"projection parallel to the x-axis\", respectively.\n\nA point of is critical for formula_5, if the tangent to exists and is parallel to the \"y\"-axis. In that case, the images by formula_5 of the critical point and of the tangent are the same point of the \"x\"-axis, called the critical value. Thus a point is critical for formula_5 if its coordinates are solution of the system of equations:\n\nThis implies that this definition is a special case of the general definition of a critical point, which is given below.\n\nThe definition of a critical point for formula_6 is similar. If is the graph of a function formula_14, then is critical for formula_6 if and only if is a critical point of , and that the critical values are the same.\n\nSome authors define the critical points of as the points that are critical for either formula_6 or formula_5, although they depend not only on , but also on the choice of the coordinate axes. It depends also on the authors if the singular points are considered as critical points. In fact the singular points are the points that satisfy\n\nand are thus solutions of either system of equations characterizing the critical points. With this more general definition, the critical points for formula_5 are exactly the points where the implicit function theorem does not apply.\n\nWhen the curve is algebraic, that is when it is defined by a bivariate polynomial , then the discriminant is a useful tool to compute the critical points.\n\nHere we consider only the projection formula_5; Similar results apply to formula_6 by exchanging and .\n\nLet\nformula_22\nbe the discriminant of viewed as a polynomial in with coefficients that are polynomials in . This discriminant is thus a polynomial in which has the critical values of formula_5 among its roots.\n\nMore precisely, a simple root of formula_22 is either a critical value of formula_5 such the corresponding critical point is a point which is not singular nor an inflection point, or the -coordinate of an asymptote which is parallel to the -axis and is tangent \"at infinity\" to an inflection point (inflexion asymptote).\n\nA multiple root of the discriminant correspond either to several critical points or inflection asymptotes sharing the same critical value, or to a critical point which is also an inflection point, or to a singular point.\n\nFor a function of several real variables, a point \"P\" (that is a set of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in R) is critical if it is a point where the gradient is undefined or the gradient is zero. The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points.\n\nA critical point may be either a local maximum, a local minimum or a saddle point. If the function is at least twice continuously differentiable the different cases may be distinguished by considering the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives.\n\nA critical point at which the Hessian matrix is nonsingular is said to be \"nondegenerate\", and the signs of the eigenvalues of the Hessian determine the local behavior of the function. In the case of a function of a single variable, the Hessian is simply the second derivative, viewed as a 1×1-matrix, which is nonsingular if and only if it is not zero. In this case, a non-degenerate critical point is a local maximum or a local minimum, depending on the sign of the second derivative, which is positive for a local minimum and negative for a local maximum. If the second derivative is null, the critical point is generally an inflection point, but may also be an undulation point, which may be a local minimum or a local maximum.\n\nFor a function of \"n\" variables, the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at a critical point is called the \"index\" of the critical point. A non-degenerate critical point is a local maximum if and only if the index is \"n\", or, equivalently, if the Hessian matrix is negative definite; it is a local minimum if the index is zero, or, equivalently, if the Hessian matrix is positive definite. For the other values of the index, a non-degenerate critical point is a saddle point, that is a point which is a maximum in some directions and a minimum in others.\n\nBy Fermat's theorem, all local maxima and minima of a continuous function occur at critical points. Therefore, to find the local maxima and minima of a differentiable function, it suffices, theoretically, to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros. This does not work well in practice because it requires the solution of a nonlinear system of simultaneous equations, which is a difficult task. The usual numerical algorithms are much more efficient for finding local extrema, but cannot certify that all extrema have been found.\nIn particular, in global optimization, these methods cannot certify that the output is really the global optimum.\n\nWhen the function to minimize is a multivariate polynomial, the critical points and the critical values are solutions of a system of polynomial equations, and modern algorithms for solving such systems provide competitive certified methods for finding the global minimum.\n\nGiven a differentiable map \"f\" from R into R, the critical points of \"f\" are the points of R, where the rank of the Jacobian matrix of \"f\" is not maximal. The image of a critical point under \"f\" is a called a critical value. A point in the complement of the set of critical values is called a regular value. Sard's theorem states that the set of critical values of a smooth map has measure zero. In particular, if \"n\" = 1, there is a finite number of critical values in each bounded interval.\n\nSome authors give a slightly different definition: a critical point of \"f\" is a point of R where the rank of the Jacobian matrix of \"f\" is less than \"n\". With this convention, all points are critical when \"m\" < \"n\".\n\nThese definitions extend to differential maps between differentiable manifolds in the following way. Let formula_26 be a differential map between two manifolds and of respective dimensions \"m\" and \"n\". In the neighborhood of a point of and of , charts are diffeomorphisms formula_27 and formula_28 The point is critical for if formula_29 is critical for formula_30 This definition does not depend on the choice of the charts because the transitions maps being diffeomorphisms, their Jacobian matrices are invertible and multiplying by them does not modify the rank of the Jacobian matrix of formula_30 If \"M\" is a Hilbert manifold (not necessarily finite dimensional) and \"f\" is a real-valued function then we say that \"p\" is a critical point of \"f\" if \"f\" is \"not\" a submersion at \"p\".\n\nCritical points are fundamental for studying the topology of manifolds and real algebraic varieties. In particular, they are the basic tool for Morse theory and catastrophe theory.\n\nThe link between critical points and topology already appears at a lower level of abstraction. For example, let formula_32 be a sub-manifold of formula_33 and be a point outside formula_34 The square of the distance to of a point of formula_32 is a differential map such that each connected component of formula_32 contains at least a critical point, where the distance is minimal. It follows that the number of connected components of formula_32 is bounded above by the number of critical points.\n\nIn the case of real algebraic varieties, this observation associated with Bézout's theorem allows us to bound the number of connected components by a function of the degrees of the polynomials that define the variety.\n\n"}

She is the eldest daughter of Tatsuhiko Kawashima and his wife Kazuyo Sugimoto. The family moved to Philadelphia in 1967 while her father attended the University of Pennsylvania. He earned a doctorate at University of Pennsylvania in 1971 in regional science and later taught there.\n\nKiko attended elementary and high school in Vienna, Austria, when her father became the chief researcher at The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, where he studied spatial science and NGO activities. The future princess became fluent in English and German. In 1972, they moved back to Japan, and her father taught economics at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. She lived with her parents and brother in a tiny on-campus apartment in Tokyo. She graduated from the Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Letters of Gakushuin University with a Bachelor of Letters degree in Psychology in 1989 and received a Master of Humanities degree in Social Psychology from the Graduate School of Gakushuin University in 1995. She received the PhD degree in Humanities from Ochanomizu University.\n\nShe participated in The Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Program (SSEAYP) in 1987 and continues to be a supporter of the program.\n\nPrince Fumihito first proposed marriage to Kiko Kawashima on 26 June 1986 while they were both undergraduates at Gakushuin. Three years later, the Imperial Household Council announced the engagement on 12 September 1989 and the engagement ceremony was held on 12 January 1990. No marriage date would be set until the official one-year mourning period ended for Fumihito's grandfather, Emperor Hirohito, who had died in January 1989.\n\nThe wedding took place at an exclusive shrine at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 29 June 1990. The Imperial Household Council had previously granted the prince permission to establish a new branch of the Imperial Family and the Emperor granted him the title \"Akishino-no-miya\" (Prince Akishino) on his wedding day. Upon marriage, his bride became \"Her Imperial Highness The Princess Akishino,\" known informally as \"Princess Kiko\". As of tradition dictates, upon her entry into the imperial family and like other members, she received a personal emblem (): iris setosa ().\n\nThe engagement and marriage of Prince Akishino to the former Kiko Kawashima broke precedent in several respects. At the time, the groom was still a graduate student at Gakushuin and he would be married before his older brother, Crown Prince Naruhito. Officials at the Imperial Household Agency were opposed to the marriage, and as was Prince Akishino's paternal-grandmother Empress Dowager Nagako. The first woman from a middle-class background to marry into the imperial family, she was given the nickname \"the apartment princess\" by the media. Although Empress Michiko was also born a commoner, she was from a very wealthy family; her father was the president of a large flour-milling company.\n\nThe Princess had said repeatedly that she wanted to finish her master's degree, if circumstances permitted. She completed her post-graduate studies in psychology between her official duties and received her master's degree in psychology in 1995. She is known for her continuing interest in deaf culture and the Deaf in Japan. She learned Japanese sign language and she is a skilled sign language interpreter. She attends the \"Sign Language Speech Contest for High School Students\" held every August, and \"Praising Mothers Raising Children with Hearing Impairments\" every December. In October 2008, she participated in the \"38th National Deaf Women's Conference.\" She also signs in informal Deaf gatherings.\n\nIn March 2013, Kiko was granted a PhD degree in Psychology at the Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences, Ochanomizu University, for her dissertation entitled \"Knowledge, perceptions, beliefs and behaviors related to tuberculosis: A study based on questionnaire surveys with seminar participants of the National Federation of Community Women's Organizations for TB Control and female college students.\"\n\nWhile pregnant with her third child, Kiko was diagnosed with placenta praevia. The princess also suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome osteoporosis aggravated by child-nursing, a symptom common among middle-aged women, her doctor said on 14 December 2007.\n\nSince 1997, Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko and their children have maintained a principal residence on the grounds of the Akasaka Estate in Motoakasaka, Minato, Tokyo. The couple have two daughters and one son:\n\nThe Prince and Princess are called upon to meet with important overseas visitors to improve diplomatic relations. The Princess was chosen as one of the Young Global Leaders for 2007, drawn from a poll of 4000 candidates.\n\nThe Prince and Princess have made numerous official visits to foreign countries. In June 2002, they became the first members of the Imperial Family to visit Mongolia, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. In October 2002, they visited the Netherlands to attend the funeral of Prince Claus of the Netherlands. In September 2003, the Prince and Princess made goodwill visits to Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, again, the first time ever members of the Imperial Family had visited these countries. In March 2004, the Prince and Princess returned to the Netherlands for the funeral of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. In January 2005, they visited Luxembourg to attend the funeral of Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte. From October to November 2006, they visited Paraguay to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japanese emigration to that country. In January 2008, they visited Indonesia for a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nThey visited Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in May 2009 on the occasion of \"Japan-Danube Friendship Year 2009\" and the Netherlands in August 2009 for the commemorative event of the 400th anniversary of the trade relations between Japan and the Netherlands. They have visited Costa Rica, Uganda, Croatia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Peru, and Argentina. From June to July 2014, Prince Fumihito and Princess Kiko visited Republic of Zambia and United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nIn June-July 2019, the couple carried out the first official overseas visit by the imperial family following the accession of Emperor Naruhito. They visited Poland and Finland to participate in the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relationship between Japan and the two countries. In August 2019, the couple and their son, Hisahito, arrived to Bhutan for a visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was formed in 1976 by the amalgamation of two schools, Corpus Christi Bi-Lateral School and Becket Grammar School for Boys. It is one of three Catholic secondary schools in the Greater Nottingham area, along with Christ the King and Trinity School.\n\nThe school moved to its new site, on Wilford Lane, at the beginning of the 2009–10 school year and lies within the Diocese of Nottingham and the Parish of the Holy Spirit, West Bridgford.\n\nThe school has a large catchment area covering parts of the City of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and south-eastern Derbyshire, including such places as St Ann's, Carlton, Clifton, Long Eaton and West Bridgford. For Years 7 to 11 there are six forms, designated by the initial letters, B, E, N, P, R, and T, of six saints: Bernadette Soubirous, Edmund Campion, Nicholas Garlick, Patrick, Robert Ludlam and Thérèse of Lisieux.\n\nBecket Grammar School was founded in 1929 by two priests (Fr Aidan Kenny and Fr Bede Horwood) from the Order of the Augustinians of the Assumption. The school was for boys only and was based on Wilford Lane, next to the suspension bridge over the River Trent. The Becket school was at that time an independent boys' grammar school. In 1958, about two miles away along Wilford Lane, Corpus Christi school opened under headmaster Arthur Davis as a mixed bilateral school for pupils 11 to 16+, offering Grammar, Technical and Secondary Modern courses. The school was planned by Reginald W Cooper of Nottingham, and was built by A Mason Ltd of Mansfield. It cost approximately £100,000.\n\nIn 1975, there were only two priests of the Assumption Order still at the Becket school; the headteacher, Father Roger Killeen and his bursar. At that time, the Order gave The Becket School to the Diocese of Nottingham and the two schools, The Becket and Corpus Christi, were amalgamated. The heads of the two schools, Father Roger and Mr Arthur Davis, who were in post at that time gave up their headships to enable the amalgamation to go ahead. A new headteacher, Terence Dillon, was appointed to the new school in 1975 and carried out the bringing together of the two very different institutions into one successful school. The school governors decided to call the new school The Becket Comprehensive School, though the term Comprehensive has rarely been used. The new headmaster took on the challenge of creating one school, whilst some parents of the former Becket School endeavoured to resist any changes as they sought to protect the privileged position of their sons. The new headteacher managed to bring staff together on the two sites of the former schools and created a school which became pre-eminent in Nottingham during the 1970s and 1980s and continues to hold a favoured position. Terence Dillon moved from the school in 1984 to become one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools. The buildings of the original schools were demolished in the summer of 2012 to be replaced by a brand new school on Wilford Lane. \nDuring the period 1929–1968, the Becket School enjoyed a close association with the Order's other school, St Michael's College, Hitchin, with which there was frequent interchange of staff in the years before amalgamation.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 70s and 80s the school was particularly renowned for its sporting achievements at a national level, producing several national schoolboy champions in both athletics and rowing.\n\nA new school site was constructed from 2007 to 2009 on Gresham Fields, Wilford Lane, situated between the three previous sites, and opened on 15 September 2009. The project cost was £24.5 million. There was also fund raising by the school and local parishes to raise £100,000 for the new school building to have a Chapel.\n\n\n\n"}

These basic systems are envisaged for use by around 2,000 German soldiers from all services. More systems of the enhanced version will be delivered between 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe IdZ system covers self-protection against small caliber arms and nuclear, biological and chemical agents, communications, navigation/ orientation and weaponry. The system utilizes a wide range of new technologies to achieve network-centric warfare capability.\n\nThe Projekthaus System Soldat industrial consortium led by Rheinmetall Defence is currently developing IdZ -ES- for the German Army, the German Air Force and the German Navy. Prototype units will be delivered during Q1/2 in 2008. Approx. 1.100 IdZ-ES systems are scheduled for deliveries between 2010 and 2014. The IdZ-ES system particularly focuses on the infantry squad in combination with its transport vehicle, which will function as \"mother ship\" providing the squad with network centric capabilities. The vehicle has all weapons and equipment on board so that the necessary elements can be selected from the modular system. The vehicle also provides the squad with power supply and allows data transmission. The basic version of the IdZ system has already been integrated in some military vehicles, such as the ATF Dingo, Mungo ESK, TPz Fuchs and BV 206 D/S. The enhanced ES-system offers these capabilities as standard options in the future Boxer MRAV vehicles and Puma infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nBoth standard sniper rifles of the Bundeswehr, the G22 and the G82, will be integrated into the IdZ program. The G82 has been procured specifically for this program.\n\nThe KM2000 is the new standard combat knife of the Bundeswehr. \nThe laser-cut blade is 17.2 cm (6.77 in) long and made of stainless steel. The knob is ergonomically shaped to be used ambidextrously and is made of polyamide. The entire knife weighs approximately 320 grams (11.2 oz).\n\nThe IdZ system will be supplement by mini- or micro UAVs or small, remotely controlled offroad vehicles. First UAVs are the Aladin airborne reconnaissance drone and the MIKADO air robot for close area imaging. The video feedback of the Aladin and the MIKADO air robot can be displayed on the soldiers NavIComs or on video visors.\n\nRecently the Bundeswehr decided against the AN/PAS-13 in favor of the HuntIR thermal sight, produced by Diehl BGT Defence, + the NSA80 night vision. Also the LLM01 laser light module for the G36 has been ordered.\n\nAlso a video weapon sight and reconnaissance 40mm ammunition are currently under development for future integration into the IdZ-program.\n\n"}

They are also considered to be 'docile'.\n\nThe salmon pink bird-eater can attain a leg size of up to 11 inches; especially in males as their legs are longer than the female’s. However, females can weigh more than 100 grams. Females are often bulky: they have a large body size in comparison to their legs, whereas males tend to be slender in body size. Mature males will also have tibial hooks on the front pair of legs; these hook back a female’s fangs during mating.\n\nThey are widely considered by pet traders to be an aesthetically pleasing tarantula species; they are a uniform black colour, and once mature, have pink-red hairs along the legs, chelicerae and abdomen, with colours tending to be more vibrant in males.\n\n\"L. parahybana\" are endemic to Brazil in the Atlantic forest region of the country; they are known from one area near Campina Grande.\n\nWhen threatened, the tarantula will raise its legs in the air, as well as the front of its body, in order to deter predators. If the attacker continues to attack, the tarantula will bite.\nThe Brazilian salmon pink tarantula is capable of delivering a painful bite. They are known to bite only when provoked, and even then, this is a last resort. Bites from an \"L. parahybana\" are mechanically dangerous; fangs can be up to an inch long. Some sites claim that a bite from a salmon pink is similar to that of a cat.\nHowever, rather than biting, they choose to flick urticating hairs from a patch on their abdomen; these hairs are covered in barbs which irritate the skin and put off potential predators. These hairs are extremely irritating; in the hobby, they are considered to be one of the more painful hair types. Hairs that get into the eyes can cause blindness.\n\nIn the wild, the tarantulas inhabit the forest floor, where they stay in hiding places such as leaf litter, inside logs, or in burrows, or out in the open. They are ambush predators, lying in wait and striking prey as it comes close, and quickly injecting venom to subdue it. They do not spin webs. In the wild, a salmon pink will feed mainly on large insects, and occasionally amphibians and small reptiles. Although they are called bird-eating spiders, there is very little evidence to suggest they actually catch and eat birds.\n\nDue to their exoskeleton and method of growth, salmon pinks, like many invertebrates, regularly moult out of their old skin (ecdysis). Like most tarantulas, they will lie on their back and force themselves out of their old skin. During this time, they are at risk of predation. A tarantula will stop eating a few days before this process.\n\nDuring the breeding season, males will deposit sperm from their abdomen onto a webbed mat, also known as a sperm web. They will then “soak” up the sperm with its pedipalps and find a female. When a female is located, the two trade signals in order to establish species, and to discover if the female is receptive.\nThe male will push a female back with his front two legs, using the tibial hooks to push the fangs back in order to prevent being over-powered and eaten by the female. He will then insert his pedipalp into the epigastric furrow on the female’s abdomen and empties his pedipalp. He repeats this with the other pedipalp.\n\nOnce mating is over, the male will unhook his front legs from the female and run. Females have a tendency to give chase for a short while; males who are too slow are at risk of being eaten in order to sustain the future embryos.\n\nBrazilian salmon pink tarantulas are very popular in captivity for a number of reasons. Their appearance, both in size and color, makes them desirable. Their willingness to sit out in the open also makes them popular. They are also a cheaper option than a \"T. blondi\"; \"L. parahybana\" reproduces in large numbers to the point that the price of spiderlings drops dramatically.\n\n\"L. parahybana\" is also praised in the tarantula trade for their ease of handling compared to other tarantula species. However, the merits of handling them is still debated, especially taking into account the size and power of the fangs when handling. They also possess urticating hairs on the rear of the abdomen which they kick into the air using their rear legs if they feel threatened or agitated. The hairs are extremely irritating to the skin and can rarely cause blindness if they get into the eye. Handling can also be dangerous to the tarantula - with terrestrial species such as \"L. parahybana\", because they are so heavily bodied, a fall of more than a few inches can rupture the abdomen and severely injure or kill the tarantula.\n\n"}

The Maxiflex Model B, the board used in all major competitive diving events, is made out of such aluminum, and is heat treated for a yield strength of . The slip-resistant surface of the board is created using an epoxy resin, finished with a laminate of flint silica and alumina in between the top coats of resin. This thermal-cured resin is aqua-colored to match the water of a clean pool.\n\nThe spring constant of a springboard is usually adjusted by way of a fulcrum that is located approximately mid way along the springboard. Springboards are usually operated in a linear regime where they approximately obey Hooke's law. When loaded with a diver, the combination of the diver's approximately constant mass, and the constant stiffness of the spring(board) result in a resonance frequency that is adjustable by way of the spring constant (set by the fulcrum position). Since the resulting system is in an approximately linear regime, it may be modeled fairly accurately by a second order differential equation. Typically the resonance frequency can be adjusted over a range of a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.\n\nThe fulcrum of competitive diving boards travels over a range of , and is set by way of a foot wheel that is approximately in diameter. To stiffen the spring (as if tightening it), the foot wheel is usually turned counter clockwise. Some may find this counter intuitive, since usually things are tightened by turning clockwise. However, with a little experience, people realize the fulcrum moves in the direction the bottom of the foot faces when placed on the foot wheel.\n\nSpringboards are usually located either above the water surface. It is very seldom that one is mounted at a height other than these two standard heights.\n\nBefore around 1960, springboards, usually made of wood, were located at heights of either , or above the water. American artist Norman Rockwell's painting titled \"Boy on High Dive\" (1947) shows a typical wooden springboard of the early 20th century era at the 7 m height.\n\nAfter an incident in Washington in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential swimming pool with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a \"suicide dive\" (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and was seriously injured and became a tetraplegic. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute (NSPI) over the inappropriate depth of the pool.\nThe NSPI had specified a minimum depth of which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards. The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner. But the courts held that the pool \"was close enough\" to the standards to hold NSPI liable. The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6 million ($8 million after interest was added) in favor of the plaintiff. The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.\n"}

After its closure it was reopened as Boundary Bay Airport.\n\nAfter the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan came into effect in 1939, the Royal Canadian Air Force began looking for locations at which to train aircrew for the Second World War. Boundary Bay was one location that was selected, and in 1940, land from three farms was appropriated for an airport. Construction proceeded slowly as boggy areas had to be filled with hay and gravel, but gravel roads and runways were in place for the airfield's opening on 10 April 1941. No. 18 Elementary Flight Training School (No. 18 EFTS) was the first unit established at the newly created Royal Canadian Air Force Station Boundary Bay. Flying De Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes, No. 18 EFTS's training was provided by private civilian instructors. The Aerodrome was officially opened by Prime Minister MacKenzie-King on 2 July 1941 with all the pomp and circumstance one might expect to find in a small patriotic community at war. A huge air demonstration was put on by the school instructors to the delight of hundreds of local spectators. This school was sponsored by the Aero Club of B.C and named the Vancouver Air Training Co. Ltd. (VATC). Less than one year before the VATC had established No. 8 EFTS stationed at RCAF Station Sea Island (current site of Vancouver International Airport) On 25 May 1942, No. 18 EFTS was disbanded as a direct result of the attack on the American Naval station at Pearl Harbor. It was felt that the West coast was now vulnerable to attack by the Japanese and Boundary Bay was the most advantageous location for a fighter Squadron to protect Vancouver and the surrounding Coast. No. 18's personnel and equipment were transferred to Royal Air Force No. 33 RAF EFTS in RCAF Station Caron, where the civilian staff took over operations from RAF staff.\n\nBetween early 1942 and April 1944 there were three operational fighter squadrons rotated through Boundary. No. 133 Squadron, equipped with Hawker Hurricanes was the first, while No. 14 and No. 132, both of which flew Curtiss Kittyhawks, were assigned later. On 1 April 1944 No. 5 Operational Training Unit, (OTU), was established at Boundary Bay. No. 5 OTU was created for the purpose of training Commonwealth crews to fly the American-built Consolidated Liberator. By 1944 the Royal Air Force had decided to increase bombing operations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific and the bomber of choice was the B-24. Boundary Bay was chosen because of its close proximity to the mountains and ocean which, it was believed, helped to create similar flying conditions that would be found in the future theater of operations. In addition to the Liberator, the North American Mitchell was used as a stepping stone to the four-engined Liberators. Other aircraft used by the unit included the Bristol Bolingbroke for target-towing, the Curtiss Kittyhawk for fighter affiliation exercises and a Noorduyn Norseman as a utility aircraft. Shortly after the first course graduated, it was decided that the crews would require additional air gunners. Therefore, a satellite unit was needed to facilitate the additional staff. On 15 July 1944 No. 5 OTU Abbotsford Detachment was created and the Liberators moved to Abbotsford. Boundary Bay was now responsible for the initial training and the Liberator crews would graduate out of Abbotsford. After the war, the airport was no longer needed. No. 5 OTU left the airfield on 31 October 1945, and the RCAF decommissioned the station in 1946. RCAF Boundary Bay's last official function of the war was to act as a demobilisation centre for the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RACF Aerodrome - Boundary Bay, British Columbia at with a Var. 24 degrees 20' E and elevation of . The aerodrome was listed with three runways as follows:\n\nThe site was left unused until it was transferred to Royal Canadian Corps of Signals in 1949. Re-established as the Vancouver Wireless Station call sign WVS, the site operated radio equipment for communication and gathering signals intelligence. The Vancouver Wireless Station had facilities much like other post-war bases, including singles quarters, 150 permanent married quarters, dining halls and messes, a Medical Inspection Room, administration building, gymnasium with a sport field with 2 ball diamonds and tennis courts, a chapel, woodworking and automotive shops, a grocery store (later CANEX), engineering and transport sections and a fire hall. Most of these facilities were located on a property directly north of the airfield.\n\nWhen the Canadian Forces were unified in 1968, the site was renamed Canadian Forces Station Ladner. The downsizing associated with unification would soon hit CFS Ladner, and in 1971 it was permanently closed.\n\nFollowing the closure of the base, the site was used by the community of Ladner for picnics, public fairs and auto racing. When it became apparent that Vancouver International Airport could no longer sustain general aviation and commercial traffic, Transport Canada proposed reactivating Boundary Bay for general aviation. The airport underwent restoration, and on 11 July 1983 two of the three runways were reopened as Boundary Bay Airport. The other runway and some ramp space was made available for driver training and other events.\n\nThe municipality of Delta maintains the area north of the airport as North 40 Park Reserve, which includes a large off-leash dog area and features interpretive historical signs throughout what was formerly the residential quarters area of the base.\n\n"}

He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (from 1958 to 1962), New York Yankees (from 1963 to 1964), Cleveland Indians (from 1965 to 1969), Minnesota Twins (from 1970 to 1971), St. Louis Cardinals (1971), and lastly the Boston Red Sox very briefly in 1972.\n\nWilliams had a significant impact in two Dodgers playoff series. After finishing in a tie for first place with the Milwaukee Braves in 1959, the teams met in a best-of-three playoff. After winning the first game, the Dodgers rallied with three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie game 2 at 5–5. Williams came on in the 10th inning and tossed three scoreless innings without allowing a hit; he was the winning pitcher as the Dodgers scored in the bottom of the 12th to win the pennant.\n\nIn the 1962 best-of-three playoff against the San Francisco Giants, Williams was not as successful. In game 2, he blew the save as the Giants tied the game with two runs in the eighth inning, but earned the win when the Dodgers scored in the bottom of the ninth to win 8–7. In the decisive third game, the Dodgers were leading in the top of the ninth 4–2. Williams entered the game with the score 4–3, bases loaded, and one out. Williams gave up a sacrifice fly to Orlando Cepeda that tied the game, then threw a wild pitch and issued an intentional walk that re-loaded the bases. He then walked Jim Davenport to force in what turned out to be the series winning run before he gave way to Ron Perranoski.\n\nWilliams, a 1960 All-Star, built a career record of 109–94 in 482 games and 208 starts. He got the majority of his wins with the Dodgers in the early stages of his 14-year career. After the 1962 season he was traded from the Dodgers to the New York Yankees for Moose Skowron. He compiled a career ERA of 3.48 and had 42 career complete games with 11 shutouts. He gave up 682 earned runs in 1764 innings pitched. He had 1305 career strikeouts. Williams won a World Series with the Dodgers in 1959, his second year in the big leagues.\n\nAlthough his control often kept him from being a top pitcher, Williams' presence on the mound was huge, and many batters around the league feared the 230-pound, right-hander, who had a blistering fastball and was not afraid to pitch inside. In 1961, Williams finished second in the league in strikeouts with 205, behind teammate Sandy Koufax (269). Yet another Dodger pitcher, Don Drysdale, finished third that year (182).\n\nWilliams was a key member of the Indians' pitching staff from 1967 to 1969. He had a 13–11 record in 1968, and led the Indians' staff in appearances in 1969.\n\nIn 1970, he went 10–1 on the season in relief, with a 1.99 ERA, for the Twins.\n\nBilly Williams hit his first major league home run off Stan Williams on October 1, 1960. Williams gave up pitcher Frank Bertaina's only major league home run, a three-run shot at Cleveland Stadium.\n\nAfter retiring, Williams served as a pitching coach for 14 MLB seasons, with the Red Sox, Yankees, Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds. More recently he was an advance scout for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays until being let go at the end of the 2006 season. As of 2010, Williams was an advance scout for the Washington Nationals.\n"}

It is the second game in the \"Lula\" series. \n\n\"Lula Pinball\" (also known as \"Lula Flipper\") is a \"Lula\" themed pinball game. \n\n\"Lula Strip Poker\" is a strip poker game where the player challenges Lula.\n\n\"Wet Attack: The Empire Cums Back\" is the third \"Lula\" game released. The player begins by stealing a spaceship, named \"The Tit\", then begins searching for Lula, who is lost in space. Following leads, the player travels from planet to planet, picking up cargo and selling for a profit. Sometimes the cargo includes contraband, which pays well, but is risky. From time to time the spaceship is attacked by pirates who try to steal cargo or girls. Players must assemble a full-body ship before they can save the lost Lula.\n\nThe player has to hire a crew for the ship, a gunner and an engineer, and keep them happy. (The crew is all female, so players have to \"keep them happy\", or may hire up to three gigolos if they would rather get on with the missions.) This helps keep the ship together. Players can also buy upgrades for \"the Tit\"; engines, guns, shields, spy satellites etc. After a while they can buy a \"second Tit\", doubling the size of the ship. While docking at a planet, the ship doubles as a brothel. The player hires girls to work in the bedrooms, and keeps them healthy, sexy, and satisfied.\n\nThe latest entry in the series, \"Lula Online\" is a browser based Simulation RPG where it plays much like Wet: The Sexy Empire, though more modernized than its older counterpart. It is currently in beta and is the only entry not developed or published by cdv Software Entertainment. \"Lula Online\"s servers were shut down in Spring 2018. \n\n"}

Coasters protect the surface of a table or any other surface where the user might place a drink. Coasters placed on top of a beverage can also be used to show that a drink is not finished or to prevent contamination (usually from insects). Coasters can also stop hot drinks burning the table surface. \n\nPubs usually will have beermats spread out across their surfaces. They are used not just to protect the surface of the table, but, as they are usually made of paper, they can also be used to absorb condensation dripping along the glass or serve as an ad-hoc notepad. Beermats are often branded with trademarks or alcohol advertising. Beermats are not to be confused with bar mats, rectangular pieces of rubber or absorbent material used to protect the countertop and limit the spread of spilled drinks in a bar or pub.\n\nThe first coasters were designed for decanters or wine bottles, so that they could be slid (or \"coasted\") around the dinner table after the servants had retired. They were in common use after about 1760. Early coasters took the form of a shallow tray or dish made of wood, papier-mâché, silver or silver plate.\n\nIn 1880, the first beermats made of cardboard were introduced by the German printing company, Friedrich Horn. In 1892, of Dresden manufactured the first beermat made of wood pulp. Watney brewery introduced them to the United Kingdom in 1920 to advertise their pale ale. The packaging company Quarmby Promotions, established in 1872, began manufacturing beermats in Milnsbridge in 1931. After Quarmby Promotions was taken over by the Katz Group, it moved production to Brighouse and in 2006 to Morley, West Yorkshire, before closing its production in 2009.\n\nSaucers are also long used in western culture for much the same purpose. When drinking tea, it is customary to use a cup and saucer set. By the mid-twentieth century, drink coasters made in many materials and styles were being manufactured for domestic use. Today, they are common as an everyday houseware piece and are also used in restaurants.\n\nCoasters are often made from high grammage paperboard, but may also be made from several layers of tissue paper. Important parameters for beer mats are water absorbency, wet rub and printability.\n\nMore recently, glass coasters with empty frames have been produced. The consumer can then personalize each one with a different picture or design. More recently some beermat manufacturers have overhauled their manufacturing processes, allowing them to supply bespoke pulpboard beermats in quantities as low as 100 without significant price premiums associated with smaller print orders. This has expanded the reach of the beermat with individuals choosing to have bespoke beermats printed for their wedding and political parties utilising them to deliver campaign messages. \n\nCoaster Factory and Canada Coaster, based in North America, and The Katz Group, based in Weisenbach, Germany, produce approximately 75% of the estimated 5.5 billion beermats in the world, including about two-thirds of the European market and 97% of the US market. In addition to the factory in Weisenbach, Katz has another two conversion factories in the U.S.: one in Sanborn, New York, and the other in Johnson City, Tennessee.\n\nDrink coasters are also made from soapstone, metal, wood and silicone. \n\nSome drink coasters can be recycled, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency lists the following as benefits of recycling:\n\n\nBeermats are usually adorned with a customized image—usually mentioning or advertising a brand of beer, although they can also be used to promote a drinking establishment, sports franchise, businesses or special events.\n\nSome coasters are collectible items. \"Tegestology\" is a term coined from Latin (\"\", \"covering\" or \"mat\" and -\"etis\") defined as the practice of collecting beermats or coasters, with practitioners known as \"tegestologists\". A 1960 British Pathé News short shows comedy duo Morecambe and Wise as tegestologists.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951511", "title": "Culture of Guernsey", "text": "Culture of Guernsey\n\nThe culture of Guernsey in the Bailiwick of Guernsey is a culture which has been shaped by its indigenous Norman language and traditions as well as French (especially Norman) and British (especially English) cultural influences. Cultural trends from immigrant communities such as the Portuguese have also been added.\n\nThe national animals of the island of Guernsey are the donkey and the Guernsey cow. The traditional explanation for the donkey (\"âne\" in French and Guernésiais) is the steepness of St Peter Port streets that necessitated beasts of burden for transport (in contrast to the flat terrain of the rival capital of Saint Helier in Jersey), although it is also used in reference to Guernsey inhabitants' stubbornness who boast that they are \"stubborn as a mule, with a kick like a horse!\"\n\nThe Guernsey cow is a more internationally famous icon of the island. As well as being prized for its rich creamy milk, which is claimed by some to hold health benefits over milk from other breeds, Guernsey cattle are increasingly being raised for their beef, which has a distinctive flavour and rich yellow fat. Although the number of individual islanders raising these cattle for private supply has diminished significantly since the 1960s, Guernsey steers can still be occasionally seen grazing on L'Ancresse common.\n\nThere is also a breed of goat known as the Golden Guernsey, which is distinguished by its golden-coloured coat At the end of World War II, the Golden Guernsey was almost extinct, due to interbreeding with other varieties on the island. The resurrection of this breed is largely credited to the work of a single woman, Miss Miriam Milbourne. Although no longer considered in a 'critical' status, the breed remains on the \"Watch List\" of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.\n\nGuernsey people are traditionally nicknamed \"donkeys\" or \"ânes\", especially by Jersey people (who in turn are nicknamed \"crapauds\" - toads). Inhabitants of each of the parishes of Guernsey also have traditional nicknames, although these have generally dropped out of use among the English-speaking population.\n\nThe so-called Guernsey Lily, \"Nerine sarniensis\" (\"Sarnia\" is the traditional name of the island of Guernsey in Latin), is also used as a symbol of the island.\n\n\"Sarnia Cherie\" is used as the anthem of Guernsey when a distinguishing anthem is required.\n\nLiberation Day on 9 May is the occasion of large celebrations every year to mark the end of the German occupation in 1945.\n\nDishes traditional in Guernsey cuisine are the Guernsey \"gâche\", a rich fruit bread, \"gâche mêlaïe\", apple pudding, \"bean jar\", a type of cassoulet of pork and beans, and conger soup.\n\nA local delicacy is the ormer (\"Haliotis tuberculata\") - a variety of abalone harvested from the beach at low spring tides. Other seafood such as spider crabs, mussels, lobster are popular.\n\nIn July 2006 smoking in enclosed public places (including pubs and restaurants) was banned, a law put in place to protect workers' right to a healthy working environment.\n\nEnglish is the only language spoken by a majority of the population, while Guernésiais, the Norman language of the island, is currently spoken fluently by 2% of the population (according to 2001 census). However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language and it is taught in a few Island schools. Until the early twentieth century French was the only official language. Family and place names reflect this linguistic heritage such as the word \"hougue\" from the Norse meaning hill and \"vraic\" being a type of seaweed. The island's loss of the language reflects a significant anglicisation of its culture and mindset, partly brought on by a large number of tax exiles from England. Portuguese is taught in a few schools and is spoken by around 2% of the population.\n\nVictor Hugo wrote some of his best-known works while in exile in Guernsey, including Les Misérables. His home in St Peter Port, Hauteville House, is now a museum administered by the city of Paris. In 1866, he published a novel set in the island, \"Travailleurs de la Mer\" (Toilers of the Sea), which he dedicated to the island of Guernsey.\n\nThe best-known novel by a Guernseyman is \"The Book of Ebenezer Le Page,\" by GB Edwards which, in addition to being a critically acclaimed work of literature, it also contains a wealth of insights into life in Guernsey during the twentieth century.\n\nGeorge Métivier, often considered the island's national poet, wrote in Guernésiais. Other important Guernésiais writers are Denys Corbet, Tam Lenfestey, T. H. Mahy and Marjorie Ozanne.\n\n\nTwo radio stations, BBC Guernsey and Island FM, serve Guernsey.\n\nGuernsey together with the other Channel Islands has Channel Television, an ITV regional franchise. A lot of the content of Channel TV is from/based on Jersey. It produces a daily news programme Channel Report. From the point of view of television coverage, the BBC has always treated the islands as an extension of their South West England region, relaying programmes from Plymouth to the islands. (The BBC does now broadcast an opt-out of the regional news bulletin, \"Spotlight\", for the Channel Islands.) This posed a problem to the Independent Television Authority as, constitutionally, the Television Act 1954 did not apply to the islands, so the ITA's ability to operate there had to be permitted by means of extending the Act to the islands by means of an Order in Council. Due to a technicality that prevented the Channel Islands from receiving colour television, Channel could only broadcast in black and white until 1976. However, Channel TV does not use a Channel Island website - Due to the proximity to France, French television is fairly easily received as well.\n\nThe Guernsey Press and Star is the daily newspaper.\n\nThe Reformation brought Calvinism to the islands and the later strong influence of Methodism suppressed dancing and secular music. A number of traditional songs and dances have been recorded, and some gentrified dances were collected in the 19th century in Guernsey. \"La Bébée\" (\"the Baby Polka\" or \"Klatschtanz\") is a 19th-century novelty dance which also remains popular with costumed folklore groups in various parts of Europe. Some traditional folk songs such as \"Jean, Gros Jean\" and \"J'ai perdu ma faumme\" have survived. Groups such as \"La Guaine du Vouêt\" and \"Les Dànsaeurs dé L'Assembllaïe D'Guernésiais\" perform at events such as \"Lé Viaer Marchi\".\n\nAccording to Edith Carey (1903), the traditional \"chifournie\" had disappeared from Guernsey by the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nJohn Ireland settled for a time in Guernsey.\n\nRecently, Guernsey has hosted a live music event called Guernsey Live. This music festival has been one of the biggest events in the Channel Islands and sister festival of Jersey Live.\n\nThe Music Service in Guernsey is renowned for its high quality of teaching and the effects of this can be seen in the standard of performance of many young people in the island.\n\nGuernsey participates in its own right in the Commonwealth Games.\n\nGuernsey participates in the Island Games, which it hosted in 2003. In sporting events in which Guernsey does not have international representation, when the British Home Nations are competing separately, islanders that do have high athletic skill may choose to compete for any of the Home Nations - there are, however, restrictions on subsequent transfers to represent another Home Nation. The football player Matt Le Tissier for example, tried out for the Scotland national football team but ended up playing for England.\n\nThe island's traditional colour (e.g. for sporting events) is green. The Corbet Football Field donated by Jurat Wilfred Corbet OBE in 1932 has fostered the sport greatly over the years. The annual Muratti match, inaugurated in 1905, between the Channel Islands gives an airing to the traditional rivalry between the Guernsey national football team and Jersey. Similarly the Siam Cup has been fought over by Rugby teams since 1920.\n\nBoth Guernsey F.C. and Guernsey RFC compete in England leagues. Women's rugby and football also compete in English leagues.\n\nThe Guernsey Cricket Board is an affiliate member by the International Cricket Council (ICC). and the Guernsey cricket team competes in world cricket.\n\n"}

His father died in 1914. His family descended from the Clan MacLaren in Argyll. He attended Marlborough College and Blair Lodge Academy in Polmont, Falkirk. He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he learnt to fly in Cambridge University Air Squadron, qualifying as a pilot in 1928.\n\nHe first worked for Esso.\n\nHe designed Spitfire undercarriage legs when working for Maclaren Undercarriage Company Ltd, and while living in West Drayton, Middlesex. In 1944, he retired from aeronautical design, forming the company Andrews Maclaren that manufactured aircraft components.\n\nIn 1937, he designed a system for an undercarriage that could cope with cross winds, in which the main wheels could be set to a steering angle away from straight ahead, so that an aircraft could be landed safely in a \"crabbing\" attitude. Tests with several aircraft types were conducted during and after World War II.\n\nHe designed the 'Maclaren Radiator' in 1943. It doubled the chances of an aircraft returning, if hit by a bullet. \n\nAfter the war he helped to develop anti-skid (ABS) brakes (Maxaret) for the aircraft division of Dunlop in Coventry. He formed Andrews Maclaren Ltd with Bill Andrews.\n\nThe former test pilot and designer of the Supermarine Spitfire undercarriage was inspired when his daughter visited from Moscow with his first grandchild (Anne Hambledon, born in 1962). His daughter had married George Hambledon of Pan Am, making many flights to London. After watching the parents struggle with the clumsy conventional pushchair, he used his knowledge of lightweight, collapsible structures to create a new generation of infant transport and inspire the design of future collapsible objects such as the Strida bicycle.\n\nHe designed his first buggy in 1964, which was built in his medieval farmhouse stables in Barby, Northamptonshire in England just south of Rugby. He applied for a patent, on 20 July 1965, for his 6lb B01 prototype with lightweight aluminium tubes receiving Patent No. 1,154,362. On 18 July 1966 he filed for an American patent, receiving Patent No. 3,390,893A. \n\nHe then founded his company, the Maclaren Company, in 1965.\n\nOnly after this design would aluminium tubes be used in other household equipment. The buggy went on sale in 1967, and roughly a thousand of them were manufactured that year. In 1976 that number rose to 600,000 buggies produced a year. \n. He also designed the 'Gadabout folding chair' which was produced from 1961, and was commissioned by the Ministry of Health to design a larger folding buggy for larger children with disabilities called the 'Buggy Major' this buggy was designed on square tubes instead of the usual round tubes like the 'Baby Buggy', being produced around 1970.\n\nToday the modern version of the 'Baby Buggy' are sold in over 50 countries under the Maclaren brand based in Long Buckby.\n\nHe was married to Marie Blacklock, and they had a son (who married on 15 June 1963, then moved to Hatfield Peverel in Essex, having a son in March 1965 and a daughter in April 1968) and daughter (1937-90). His grand-daughter, Anne Hambledon, for whom the baby-buggy was designed, now lives in Vermont.\n\nHis eldest brother Bruce (who also attended the University of Cambridge) married the granddaughter of Charles George Arbuthnot, and also the niece of General Sir Alexander Cobbe VC. \n\nIn January 1978, Queen Elizabeth II awarded him with an MBE in the New Year's Honours List.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to 1968 it was a combat support corps of the Canadian Army.\n\nThe badge of The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals consisted of a circle, with a Tudor Crown on top with the text Royal Canadian Corps of Signals around the edge. At the centre of the circle is the Roman God Mercury. At the bottom is a ribbon with the text \"Velox, Versutus, Vigilans\" and eight maple leaves. The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals was responsible for land communication and signalling.\n\nMajor Wallace Bruce Matthews Carruthers established a militia (Non-Permanent Active Militia) component of signallers under the designation \"Signalling Corps\" on 24 October 1903, making it the first independent signal corps in the British Empire. It was redesignated \"The Canadian Signal Corps\" on 4 June 1913. On 1 April 1919 as part of the restructuring based on experiences during the Great War, a regular (Permanent Active Militia) component was established as the \"Canadian Signalling Instructional Staff\". This was redesignated \"The Canadian Permanent Signal Corps\" on 15 December 1920. Shortly thereafter, on 15 June 1921, King George V, the Canadian monarch, bestowed on the permanent force portion of the organization the title \"The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals\". Meanwhile, on 1 August 1921, the militia component was re-titled \"Canadian Corps of Signals\"; redesignated \"Royal Canadian Corps of Signals\" on 29 April 1936 (as part of the larger military restructuring that year); and finally aligned in nomenclature with the regular component as \"The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals\" on 22 March 1948, after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nIn June 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea, initiating a conflict that became the Korean War. A United Nations-led coalition was formed with 16 countries providing troops. Canada was one of the countries to intercede in the conflict. Over 26,700 Canadian troops served as part of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (RCCS) was disbursed among the Canadian regiments as well as some American units and contributed to the overall success of the UN mission.\n\nSignalers served the war effort with distinction in multiple battles, one of which was the Battle for Kapyong.

He was the father of mineralogist and polar explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld.\n\nNordenskiöld was born in Mäntsälä in southern Finland, which was then part of the Kingdom of Sweden. After studying mineralogy in Helsingfors, now better known as Helsinki, and in Sweden, Nordenskiöld was appointed an inspector of mines in Finland. Finland had by now been transferred to Russia, as an autonomous Grand Duchy.\n\nOn October 3, 1819, Nordenskiöld was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The Academy had been established pursuant to the order of the Peter I of Russia by the Decree of the Ruling Senate dated January 28 (February 8), 1724. In 1853, he was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nNordenskiöld described and discovered a number of minerals previously unknown in Finland and Russia. In 1820, Nordenskiöld published a treatise, which was renowned as the first scientific handbook on Finnish minerals. He also published a number of articles in foreign journals, which brought him to notice far beyond Scandinavia. In future years, he was to ensure that his son, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, shared this knowledge and became renowned as an explorer in his own right.\n\nNordenskiöld returned to Finland in 1823 and in 1828 was appointed superintendent of the newly established Mining Board in Helsingfors, a post he held until his death in 1865.\n\nAccording to a widely popular but controversial story, alexandrite was discovered by Nordenskiöld, on the tsarevitch Alexander's sixteenth birthday on April 17, 1834 and named Alexandrite in honor of the future Tsar — Alexander II of Russia. Although it was Nordenskiöld who discovered alexandrite, he could not possibly have discovered and named it on Alexander's birthday. Nordenskiöld's initial discovery occurred as a result an examination of a newly found mineral sample he had received from Count Lev Alekseevich Perovskii (1792–1856), which he identified it as emerald at first. Confused with the high hardness, he decided to continue his examinations. Later that evening, while looking at the specimen under candlelight, he was surprised to see that the color of the stone had changed to raspberry-red instead of green. Later, he confirmed the discovery of a new variety of chrysoberyl, and suggested the name \"diaphanite\"(from the Greek \"di\" two and \"aphanes\", unseen or \"phan\", to appear, or show). Perovskii however had his own plans and used the rare specimen to ingratiate himself with the Imperial family by presenting it to the future Tsar and naming it Alexandrite in his honor on April 17, 1834, but it wasn't until 1842 that the description of the color changing chrysoberyl was published for the first time under the name of alexandrite.\n\nOther minerals described by Nordenskiöld include :\n\nIn 1849, Nordenskjold examined what was known as \"Ural's chrysolite\" and discovered that it was a rich green variety of andradite garnet. In 1854, he proposed for it the name demantoid (\"like a diamond\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1951604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951604", "title": "Buck Clayton", "text": "Buck Clayton\n\nWilbur Dorsey \"Buck\" Clayton (November 12, 1911 – December 8, 1991) was an American jazz trumpet player who was a leading member of Count Basie's \"Old Testament\" orchestra and a leader of mainstream-oriented jam session recordings in the 1950s. His principal influence was Louis Armstrong. \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\" says that he “synthesi[zed] much of the history of jazz trumpet up to his own time, with a bright brassy tone and an apparently limitless facility for melodic improvisation”. Clayton worked closely with Li Jinhui, father of Chinese popular music in Shanghai. His contributions helped change musical history in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nClayton learned to play the piano from the age of six. His father was an amateur musician associated with the family's local church, who was responsible for teaching his son the scales on a trumpet which he did not take up until his teens. From the age of seventeen, Clayton was taught the trumpet by Bob Russell, a member of George E. Lee's band. In his early twenties he was based in California, and was briefly a member of Duke Ellington's Orchestra and worked with other leaders. Clayton was also taught at this time by trumpeter Mutt Carey, who later emerged as a prominent west-coast revivalist in the 1940s. After high school, he moved to Los Angeles. He later formed a band named “14 Gentlemen from Harlem” in which he was the leader of the 14-member orchestra.\n\nFrom there, there are multiple sources claiming different ways in which Clayton ended up in Shanghai. Some claimed that Clayton was picked by Teddy Weatherford for a job at the Canidrome ballroom in the French Concession in Shanghai. Others claimed he escaped the US temporarily to avoid racism.\n\nFrom 1934 or 1935 (depending on the sources), he was a leader of the \"Harlem Gentlemen\" in Shanghai. Some of the bureaucratic social groups he was with included Chiang Kai-shek's wife Soong Mei-ling and her sister Ai-ling, who were regulars at the Canidrome. Clayton would play a number of songs that were composed by Li Jinhui, while adopting the Chinese music scale into the American scale. Li learned a great deal from the American jazz influence brought over by Clayton. A 1935 guidebook in Shanghai listed Clayton and Teddy Weatherford as the main jazz attraction at the Canidrome. He would eventually leave Shanghai before the 1937 Second Sino-Japanese War. Clayton is credited for helping to close the gap between traditional Chinese music and shidaiqu/mandopop. Li is mostly remembered in China as a casualty of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nLater that year he accepted an offer from bandleader Willie Bryant in New York, but while moving east he stopped off in Kansas City and was persuaded to stay by Count Basie, whose orchestra had a residency at the Reno Club, and took the trumpet chair recently vacated by Hot Lips Page. From 1937, the Count Basie orchestra was based in New York, giving Clayton the opportunity to freelance in the recordings studios, and he participated in recordings sessions featuring Billie Holiday and was also present on Commodore (and later Keynote Records) sessions with Lester Young. Clayton remained with Basie until he was drafted for war service in November 1943. Based at Camp Kilmer near New York, Clayton was able to participate in various all-star sessions, some of which were led by Sy Oliver.\n\nAfter his honorable discharge in 1946 he prepared arrangements for Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Harry James and became a member of Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic package, appearing in April in a concert with Young, Coleman Hawkins and Charlie Parker, and in October participated in JATPs first national tour of the United States. He also recorded at this time for the H.R.S. label. In 1947 he was back in New York, and had a residency at the Café Society, Downtown, and the following year had a reunion with Jimmy Rushing, his fellow Basie alumnus, at the Savoy Ballroom. Clayton and Rushing worked together occasionally into the 1960s.\n\nFrom September 1949 Clayton was in Europe for nine months, leading his own band in France. Clayton recorded intermittently over the next few years for the French Vogue label, under his own name, that of clarinetist Mezz Mezzrow and for one session, with pianist Earl Hines. In 1953, he was again in Europe, touring with Mezzrow; in Italy, the group was joined by Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe English critic Stanley Dance coined the term \"mainstream\" in the 1950s to describe the style of those swing era players who fell between the revivalist and modernist camps. Clayton was precisely one of the players to whom this appellation most applied. In December 1953 Clayton embarked on a series of jam session albums for Columbia, which had been the idea of John Hammond, though George Avakian was the principal producer. The recording sessions for these albums lasted until 1956. The tracks could last the length of an LP side, and it had been the new format that had given Hammond the idea, but sometimes this led to unfortunate anomalies. The title track on the \"Jumpin' at the Woodside\" album was compiled from two takes recorded four months apart, each with a completely different rhythm section. Clayton's \"Jazz Spectacular\" album from this series (with Kai Winding, J. J. Johnson and vocals by Frankie Laine) is loved by jazz and pop fans alike. Clayton also recorded at this time for Vanguard, with Hammond producing, under his own name and on dates led by Ruby Braff, Mel Powell and Sir Charles Thompson.\n\nIn 1955 he appeared in \"The Benny Goodman Story\", also working with Goodman in New York at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel two years later. In 1958 he was at the World Fair in Brussels for concerts with Sidney Bechet, and toured Europe the following year and annually through the 1960s. For the Swingville label (a subsidiary of Prestige Records) he co-led two albums with former Basie colleague Buddy Tate and supported Pee Wee Russell on his own outing for the label.\n\nIn 1964 he performed in Japan, Australia and New Zealand with Eddie Condon, with whom he had already occasionally worked for several years. In 1965 he toured England with trombonist Vic Dickenson and blues singer Big Joe Turner accompanied by British trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his Band. This group featured on \"Jazz 625\" for BBC television (later released on DVR). He made numerous visits to England thereafter and recorded three albums with Lyttelton. In order to hoodwink the musicians' union in the UK, it was necessary to claim that these albums were recorded in Switzerland. A live audio recording made on a club date with Lyttelton was released on Lyttelton's own Calligraph Records label (CLG CD 048).\n\nShortly after appearing at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in 1969, Clayton underwent lip surgery, and had to give up playing the trumpet in 1972. He was able to resume playing in 1977 for a State Department sponsored tour of Africa, but had to permanently stop playing in 1979, though he still worked as an arranger. He began to teach at Hunter College, CUNY from 1975–80 and again in the early eighties.\n\nThe semi-autobiography \"Buck Clayton’s Jazz World\", co-authored by Nancy Miller Elliott, first appeared in 1986. In the same year, his new Big Band debuted at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, and Clayton toured internationally with it, contributing 100 compositions to the band book.\n\nBuck Clayton died quietly in his sleep in 1991.\n\n\nWith Count Basie\nWith Coleman Hawkins\nWith Frankie Laine\n\nWith Mel Powell\nWith Paul Quinichette\nWith Red Richards\nWith Buddy Tate\nWith Dicky Wells\n\nWith Count Basie\n\n"}

They speak Mozabite (\"Tumẓabt\"), one of the Zenati languages in the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family. Many also speak Maghrebi Arabic as a second language. Mozabites are primarily Ibadi Muslims, but there was a small population of Jews as well.\n\nMozabites mainly live in five oases; namely, Ghardaïa, Beni Isguen, El Atteuf, Melika and Bounoura, as well as two other isolated oases farther north: Berriane and Guerrara.\n\nAccording to tradition the Ibadis, after their overthrow at Tiaret by the Fatimids during the 10th century, took refuge in the country to the south-west of Ouargla. and founded an independent state there.\n\nIn 1012, owing to further persecutions, they fled to their present location, where they long remained invulnerable.\n\nAfter the capture of Laghouat by France, the Mozabites concluded a convention with them in 1853, whereby they accepted to pay an annual contribution of 1,800 francs in return for their independence. In November 1882, the M'zab country was definitely annexed to French Algeria.\n\nGhardaïa (population of 93,423) is the capital of the confederacy, followed in importance by Beni Isguen (4,916), the chief commercial centre.\n\nSince the establishment of French control, Beni Isguen has become the depot for the sale of European goods. The Mozabite engineers built a system of irrigation works that made the oases much more fertile than they used to be.\n\nMozabites speak Mozabite (Tumẓabt), a branch of the Zenati group of Berber languages.\n\nMozabite people are characterized by a very high level of North African haplogroups E1b1b1b (M81) (86%) and U6 (28%).\n\nIt is not canonically agreed when Jews first came to Southern Algeria, but one theory suggests they were sent there by the Ibadite leadership in the 14th Century from Tunisia, as part of a merchant trade route. They continued as a merchant community, with subsequent waves of immigration during times of anti-Semitism across the Sahara, Europe, and the Middle East. In 1881, one year before the French annex of the Mzab, there were estimated 3,000 Mozabite Jews, out of 30,000 general Algerian Jews. By 1921, this number would grow to 74,000, a result of a spike in anti-Semitism in the later 1800s and early 1900s, though the Mozabite Jewish community would remain small, with most Jewish migrants settling in the North.\n\nIn 1882, when the French military annexed the Mzab, they began an administrative rule that was separate from their Northern departments. Unlike their Northern Jewish counterparts, many of the Mozabite Berber Jews in Southern Algeria were classified by the French under the “indigenous code”. Given the diversity of the Mzab Jewish population, the French administration incorporated some “culturally Saharan”, but ethnically non-indigenous Jews into the North, and gave them citizenship under the Crémieux Decree of 1870. This perceived distinction by the French between Berber and non-Berber Jews of the Mzab was not a reflection of “technical precision”, but rather “a manufactured form of legal difference.” While the French sought to assimilate the Northern Jewry as French citizens, they recognized religious rule of the Mozabite Jewish population, while keeping them separate under indigenous law, which meant severely limited political and social power.\n\nWith anti-Semitism on the rise in the late 1800s, French colonial powers sought to decrease Jewish commerce in the South, and prevent further Jewish collaboration with Muslim communities. They continued to distance the Mozabite Jews from other Algerian Jewish affairs, keeping Mozabite, or “Mosaic” laws for civil matters, and French indigenous laws for public and criminal matters. It was not until 1961, with the French National Assembly Law 61-805 that the Mozabite Jews were granted “common law civil status” and French citizenship.\n\n\n"}

There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\n\nIn the elections of November 2007, Stephen Sanders and Joan Downing were elected without opposition to the positions of township trustee and township fiscal officer respectively.\n\nImportant highways in Pleasant Township are State Routes 47 and 235.\n\n"}

This article explains how to convert between the two representations. Actually this simple use of \"quaternions\" was first presented by Euler some seventy years earlier than Hamilton to solve the problem of magic squares. For this reason the dynamics community commonly refers to quaternions in this application as \"Euler parameters\".\n\nFor the rest of this article, the JPL quaternion convention shall be used. A unit quaternion can be described as:\n\nWe can associate a quaternion with a rotation around an axis by the following expression\n\nwhere α is a simple rotation angle (the value in radians of the angle of rotation) and cos(β), cos(β) and cos(β) are the \"direction cosines\" locating the axis of rotation (Euler's Rotation Theorem).\n\nSimilarly for Euler angles, we use the Tait Bryan angles (in terms of flight dynamics):\nwhere the X-axis points forward, Y-axis to the right and Z-axis downward with angles defined for clockwise/lefthand rotation. In the conversion example above the rotation occurs in the order heading, attitude, bank (about intrinsic axes).\n\nThe orthogonal matrix (post-multiplying a column vector) corresponding to a clockwise/left-handed (looking along positive axis to origin) rotation by the unit quaternion formula_10 is given by the inhomogeneous expression:\n\nor equivalently, by the homogeneous expression:\n\nIf formula_13 is not a unit quaternion then the homogeneous form is still a scalar multiple of a rotation matrix, while the inhomogeneous form is in general no longer an orthogonal matrix. This is why in numerical work the homogeneous form is to be preferred if distortion is to be avoided.\n\nThe direction cosine matrix (from the rotated Body XYZ coordinates to the original Lab xyz coordinates for a clockwise/lefthand rotation) corresponding to a post-multiply Body 3-2-1 sequence with Euler angles (ψ, θ, φ) is given by:\n\nBy combining the quaternion representations of the Euler rotations we get for the Body 3-2-1 sequence, where the airplane first does yaw (Body-Z) turn during taxiing onto the runway, then pitches (Body-Y) during take-off, and finally rolls (Body-X) in the air. The resulting orientation of Body 3-2-1 sequence (around the capitalized axis in the illustration of Tait–Bryan angles) is equivalent to that of lab 1-2-3 sequence (around the lower-cased axis), where the airplane is rolled first (lab-x axis), and then nosed up around the horizontal lab-y axis, and finally rotated around the vertical lab-z axis (lB = lab2Body):\n\nOther rotation sequences use different conventions.\n\nBelow code in C++ illustrates above conversion:\nstruct Quaternion\n\nQuaternion ToQuaternion(double yaw, double pitch, double roll) // yaw (Z), pitch (Y), roll (X)\n\nThe Euler angles can be obtained from the quaternions via the relations:\n\nNote, however, that the arctan and arcsin functions implemented in computer languages only produce results between −π/2 and π/2, and for three rotations between −π/2 and π/2 one does not obtain all possible orientations. To generate all the orientations one needs to replace the arctan functions in computer code by atan2:\n\nThe following C++ program illustrates conversion above:\n\nstruct Quaternion {\n\nstruct EulerAngles {\n\nEulerAngles ToEulerAngles(Quaternion q) {\n\nOne must be aware of singularities in the Euler angle parametrization when the pitch approaches ±90° (north/south pole). These cases must be handled specially. The common name for this situation is gimbal lock.\n\nCode to handle the singularities is derived on this site: www.euclideanspace.com\n\nLet us define scalar formula_18 and vector formula_19 such that formula_20.\n\nNote that the canonical way to rotate a three-dimensional vector formula_21 by a quaternion formula_22 defining an Euler rotation is via the formula\nwhere formula_24 is a quaternion containing the embedded vector formula_21, formula_26 is a conjugate quaternion, and formula_27 is the rotated vector formula_28. In computational implementations this requires two quaternion multiplications. An alternative approach is to apply the pair of relations\nwhere formula_31 indicates a three-dimensional vector cross product. This involves fewer multiplications and is therefore computationally faster. Numerical tests indicate this latter approach may be up to 30% faster than the original for vector rotation.\n\nThe general rule for quaternion multiplication involving scalar and vector parts is given by\nUsing this relation one finds for formula_33 that\nand upon substitution for the triple product\nwhere anti-commutivity of cross product and formula_36 has been applied. By next exploiting the property that formula_37 is a unit quaternion so that formula_38, along with the standard vector identity \none obtains\nwhich upon defining formula_29 can be written in terms of scalar and vector parts as \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951653", "title": "Andain", "text": "Andain\n\nAndain was a San Francisco-based electronic music duo, originally formed in 2000. They broke through in 2002 after being discovered by DJ Tiësto, reaching clubbers worldwide with their singles \"Summer Calling\" in 2002 and \"Beautiful Things\" in 2003. The band members initially included producer Josh Gabriel, singer and songwriter Mavie Marcos, and guitarist David Penner, before the group disbanded in 2006. Andain returned again in 2011 as Josh and Mavie, making their comeback with the single \"Promises\". The successive year saw the release of the band's first and only full-length album, on September 12, 2012, following a year of touring and performing. Andain was eventually concluded in 2014.\n\nAndain began as an experimental electronica group in 2000, making their breakthrough in 2002 with the song \"Summer Calling\", after getting attention from Tiësto and signing with Black Hole. This eventually lead to the production of a club remix by Josh Gabriel, which was then promoted on Tiësto's compilation album \"\", to later be released as a 12\" single with the B-side \"Gabriel & Dresden Remix\".\n\nThe following year saw the release of Andain's second single, \"Beautiful Things\", which since became the band's biggest hit and signature song. Being released and promoted as a remix by Gabriel & Dresden, the song made its first appearance on Tiësto's compilation album \"Nyana\", eventually spawning a single. With enthusiastic reception from the club music scene, it has since become recognised as the band's signature track, spawning several remixes from Black Hole over the years.\n\nWhile the sound of Andain would appear to be promoted as club oriented, a batch of leaked demos, namely \"Time\", \"Get Up\", \"Make Me\", \"Ave Maria\", and \"You Once Told Me\", would reveal a more experimental style of electronica with fusions of acoustic elements. As the leak would denote, the band was planning to record a full-length album, that was initially scheduled for a release in 2003. Meanwhile, \"Beautiful Things\" earned a nomination for Best Progressive / Trance under the Winter Music Conference 2004, with also Andain being nominated for Best New Dance Group. The year was also marked by a less prominent release from the band, with the track \"Here is the House\", a cover of Depeche Mode, presented on the compilation album \"Bloom\" by Gabriel & Dresden.\n\nWhile no further news were published about the status of the anticipated album, an announcement from July 2005 stated that Andain was working on new material. However, due to high demands from other projects, the group suspended in 2006.\n\nAndain would eventually reform in 2007 as Mavie and Josh, and the intent was set to create a new album. Two years later, an interview with Josh by Trance.nu would reveal the word of their next single, \"Promises\" – although, no word of an estimated release date was mentioned at the time. Nevertheless, the word of Andain began to stir into motion again, further supported by the leak of a new demo, \"Turn Up the Sound\".\n\nAfter four years in the making, Andain's new album was handed in to the label in early April, 2011. Subsequently, with \"Promises\" getting closer to an official release, the single was given support by some of the most recognized DJs of the EDM scene, being promoted with remixes by the likes of Gabriel & Dresden and Mÿon & Shane 54. Eventually, the album version debuted with the official music video on June 1, 2011, while the single followed on June 6, 2011.\n\nAs the second single from the upcoming album, \"Much Too Much\" was released on January 30, 2012, while the official music video followed on February 2, 2012. The single was later succeeded by a three track remix EP on February 27, 2012, and a standalone remix by Mike Shiver on April 23, 2012.\n\nWhile the album was still being prepared for release, \"Turn Up the Sound\" was selected to make an official appearance. As the third single taken from the album, the song made its debut as a three track remix EP on June 18, 2012, while the album version followed two weeks later, on July 2, 2012, along with additional remixes. Incidentally, the production of the song had been rewritten since the leak in 2009, with exception of the last part of the song, which preserved its original club oriented composition.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, the anticipated album was officially announced on Andain's Facebook page. Titled \"You Once Told Me\", the record was finally released on September 24, 2012, featuring 11 tracks. Among the tracks, the album also featured new versions of the previously leaked \"Ave Maria\" and \"You Once Told Me\", while the exclusive iTunes LP Deluxe Version of the album housed another 8 additional bonus tracks, including the original version of \"Summer Calling\", and \"Beautiful Things\" in its classic club interpretation by Gabriel & Dresden.\n\nSucceeding the release of \"You Once Told Me\", the album also spawned two additional singles. First out, \"What's It's Like\" was released on December 31, 2012, as an 8 track remix EP. In spite of the song's soft-rock nature, the remix EP sported a set of club mixes, lastly complemented by the album version. As the album's title track, \"You Once Told Me\" followed along one year later, released on December 16, 2013. The remix EP sported 6 tracks, featuring five trance remixes along with the album version, concluding the fifth single taken from the album.\n\nAccording to the band's website, the members have moved on to new projects, including a solo career for Mavie.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the success of their single \"Beautiful Things\", Andain earned a nomination for International Dance Music Awards in 2004, with the song being selected for the category Best Progressive / Trance. Simultaneously, the band itself was also nominated for Best New Dance Group. \"Beautiful Things\" would eventually also reward a trophy, as Andain was chosen to receive the Sunset Music Awards in 2010, during the Polish Sunrise Festival.\n\nWith \"Promises\" creating a stir as the comeback song for Andain in 2011, the band received another nomination for the International Dance Music Awards 2012. The song received two nominations under the categories Best Trance Track and Best Chillout / Lounge Track. However, as a song in the downtempo genre, no specific remix had been reported for the first category.\n\nAndain also earned a nomination for the International Dance Music Awards 2013, this time with another entry in the category Best Chillout / Lounge Track, honoring Zetandel's remix of \"Much Too Much\", taken from the initial release of the 2012 single.\n\n"}

{"id": "1951662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951662", "title": "Hinduism in Bangladesh", "text": "Hinduism in Bangladesh\n\n\"For Hinduism in the State of India, see: Hinduism in West Bengal\"\n\nHinduism is the second largest religious affiliation in Bangladesh, covering about 8.7% of the population, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for 2011 Bangladesh census. In terms of population, Bangladesh is the third largest Hindu state in the world after India and Nepal. According to an estimate from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), there were 17million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015.\n\nIn nature, Bangladeshi Hinduism closely resembles the forms and customs of Hinduism practised in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, with which Bangladesh (at one time known as East Bengal) was united until the partition of India in 1947. The vast majority of Hindus in Bangladesh are Bengali Hindus.\n\nThe Goddess (\"Devi\") – usually venerated as Durga or Kali – is widely revered, often alongside her consort Shiva. The worship of Shiva has generally found adherents among the higher castes in Bangladesh. Worship of Vishnu (typically in the form of his \"Avatars\" or incarnation Rama or Krishna) more explicitly cuts across caste lines by teaching the fundamental oneness of humankind in spirit. Vishnu worship in Bengal expresses the union of the male and female principles in a tradition of love and devotion. This form of Hindu belief and the Sufi tradition of Islam have influenced and interacted with each other in Bengal. Both were popular mystical movements emphasizing the personal relationship of religious leader and disciple instead of the dry stereotypes of the brahmins or the ulama. As in Bengali Islamic practice, worship of Vishnu frequently occurs in a small devotional society (\"shomaj\"). Both use the language of earthly love to express communion with the divine. In both traditions, the Bengali language is the vehicle of a large corpus of mystical literature of great beauty and emotional impact.\n\nIn Bangladeshi Hinduism ritual bathing, vows, and pilgrimages to sacred rivers, mountains, and shrines are common practice. An ordinary Hindu will worship at the shrines of Muslim \"pirs\", without being concerned with the religion to which that place is supposed to be affiliated. Hindus revere many holy men and ascetics conspicuous for their bodily mortifications. Some believe that they attain spiritual benefit merely by looking at a great holy man. Durga Puja, held in September–October, is the most important festival of Bangladeshi Hindus and it is widely celebrated across Bangladesh. Thousands of pandals (mandaps) are set up in various cities, towns and villages to mark the festival. Other festivals are Kali Puja, Janmashtami, Holi, Saraswati Puja, Shivratri and Rathayatra, the most popular being the century-old Dhamrai Rathayatra.\n\nThe principle of \"ahimsa\" is expressed in almost universally observed rules against eating beef. By no means are all Bangladeshi Hindus vegetarians, but abstinence from all kinds of meat is regarded as a \"higher\" virtue. Brahmin (\"Brahmon\") or \"Upper-caste\" Bangladeshi Hindus, unlike their counterparts elsewhere in South Asia, ordinarily eat fish and chicken. This is similar to the Indian state of West Bengal which has a similar climate to that of Bangladesh, where Hindus also consume fish, egg, chicken and mutton.There are also non-Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh,majority of the Hajong, Rajbongshi people and Tripuris in Bangladesh are Hindus.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census there are 11,379,000 Hindus in Bangladesh. However, some estimates show that there are about 12 million Hindus in Bangladesh. Hindus in Bangladesh in the late 2000s were almost evenly distributed in all regions, with large concentrations in Gopalganj, Dinajpur, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Mymensingh, Khulna, Jessore, Chittagong and parts of Chittagong Hill Tracts. In the capital city of Dhaka, Hindus are the second-largest religious community after the Muslims and the largest concentration of Hindus can be found in and around Shankhari Bazaar of the old city. \n\nSince the rise of more explicitly Islamist political formations in Bangladesh during the 1990s, many Hindus have been intimidated or attacked, and fairly substantial numbers are leaving the country to India.\n\nIn present-day Bangladesh, Hindus became a minority only in mid-thirteenth century of the Gregorian Calendar. In 1941 the Hindus formed about 28% of the population, which declined to 22.05% in 1951, as rich and upper caste Hindus migrated to India after Partition of India in 1947. The wealthy Hindus who migrated lost their land and assets through the \"East Bengal Evacuee Act\" and the poor and middle-class Hindus that were left behind became targets of discrimination through new laws. At the outbreak of the 1965 India-Pakistan war, the \"Defense of Pakistan Ordinance\" and later the \"Enemy (Custody and Registration) Order II\", through which the Hindus were labelled as the \"enemy\" and their property expropriated by the state. Since then, it has dropped by about half. Through a combination of mass exodus and genocide in the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, this represents a loss of around 20 million Bangladeshi Hindus and their direct heirs, and reflects one of the largest displacements of population based on ethnic or religious identity in recent history. 1974 census of Bangladesh showed that the population of Hindus had fallen to 13.5%. Even after independence, the Hindus were branded \"Indian stooges\" and untrustworthy citizens. A significant driver of Hindu emigration has been the Enemy Property Act, later renamed as the Vested Property Act, through which the Bangladesh Government has been able to appropriate the property of around 40% of the existing Bangladeshi Hindu population (according to Dr Abul Barkat of Dhaka University).\n\nA significant portion of the middle-class, urban Hindu population left the region that is now Bangladesh immediately after the partition in 1947 when East Pakistan came into existence. Many of these East Bengali refugees went on to contribute actively to Indian society after their migration. In 1971, during the Liberation War of Bangladesh from Pakistan, a similar scenario happened. But even after 1971, Hindu population has continued to decline and currently they form 8.96% of the population. According to a study by Pew Research Organisation, Hindus will constitute 7% of the population of Bangladesh by 2050, while Muslims will form 92% of the population.\n\n\"Source: Census of India 1901-1941, Census of East Pakistan 1951-1961, Bangladesh Government Census 1974-2011,\" \"Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics estimate 2015\"\n\nAccording to a random sampling from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) which is less accurate and less reliable than the decadent \"Population and Housing Census\" conducted by the same agency every ten years because of the small sample size, there were 17million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015, out of a total 158.9million population.\n\nHindu temples and shrines are more or less distributed all across the country. The Kantaji Temple is an elegant example of an 18th-century temple. The most important temple in terms of prominence is the Dhakeshwari Temple, located in Dhaka. This temple along with other Hindu organizations arranges Durga Puja and Krishna Janmaashtami very prominently. The other main temples of Dhaka are the Ramakrishna Mission, Joy Kali Temple, Laxmi Narayan Mandir, Swami Bagh Temple and Siddheswari Kalimandir. The famous Ramna Kali Temple in Dhaka was destroyed by the Pakistani Army during the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, and Bangladeshi Hindus have been actively petitioning successive governments since independence to rebuild the temple on the site, where a massacre of around 100 devotees also took place.\n\nBuilt in the early 19th century, Kal Bhairab Temple at Brahmanbaria holds the largest deity of Shiva in the country. Other notable Hindu temples and ashrams of Bangladesh are Chandranath Temple, Adinath Temple, Sugandha, Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple, Pancha Ratna Govinda Temple, Bhabanipur Shaktipeeth, Chatteshwari Temple, Dhamrai Jagannath Rath, Puthia Temple Complex, Kantajew Temple, Comilla Jagannath Temple, Kaliyajeu Temple, Shri Shail, Bishwanath Temple, Boro Kali Bari Temple, Muktagacha Shiva Temple, Shyamsundar Temple, Chandrabati Temple, Lalmai Chandi Temple, Jorbangla Temple, Sonarang Twin Temples, Jagannath Temple, Pabna, Temple of King Kangsa Narayan, Barodi Lokenath Ashram, Sri Satyanarayan Seva Mandir, Sri Angan, Wahedpur Giri Dham, Ramkrishna Sevashram at Chittagong, Ram Thakur Ashram etc.\n\nMany Hindu temples have suffered from implementation of the Vested Property Act through which land and moveable property has been confiscated by agents acting on behalf of successive governments. Hindu temples are also high risk areas during communal disturbances (most recently in 1990, 1992 and 2001) when it has often been necessary to call the army to protect sensitive locations.\n\nThe Hindu community has many similar issues as the predominant Muslim community of Bangladesh. These include women's rights, dowry, poverty, unemployment and others. Issues unique to the Hindu community include maintenance of Hindu culture and temples in Bangladesh. Small sects of Islamists constantly try to politically and socially isolate the Hindus of Bangladesh. Because Hindus of Bangladesh are scattered across all areas (except in Narayanganj), they cannot unite politically. However, Hindus became sway voters in various elections. Hindus have usually voted in large mass for Bangladesh Awami League and communist parties, as these are the only parties which have a nominal commitment to secularism; the alternatives are the increasingly pro-Islamist centrist parties such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jatiya Party (which both incorporate Muslim identity into their version of Bangladeshi nationalism) or the outright Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jamaat-e-Islami) which seeks to establish Islamic law under which there would be separate provisions for Hindus as non-Muslims. However, Hindus in general maintain cordial relationships with liberal Muslims and they even participate in each other's festivals such as Durga Puja and Eid al-Fitr.\n\nThe Bangladesh Liberation War resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. As many as 2.4 million Bengali Hindus were killed by the Pakistani Army during the Liberation War and most of the Bengali Hindu-owned businesses were permanently destroyed. The historic Ramna Kali Temple in Dhaka and the century-old Rath at Dhamrai were demolished and burned down by the Pakistani Army.\n\nAn article in \"Time\" magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated \"The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred.\"\n\nSenator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, \"Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked \"H\". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad\". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Sydney Schanberg covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column \"The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored\", he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. \"Other reminders were the yellow \"H\"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army\" (by \"Muslim army\", meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994).\n\nIn the first constitution of the newly independent country, secularism and equality of all citizens irrespective of religious identity was enshrined. On his return to liberated Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his first speech to the nation, specifically recognized the disproportionate suffering of the Hindu population during the Bangladesh Liberation War. On a visit to Kolkata, India in February 1972, Mujib visited the refugee camps that were still hosting several million Bangladeshi Hindus and appealed to them to return to Bangladesh and to help rebuilding the country.\n\nDespite the public commitment of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his government to re-establishing secularism and rights of non-Muslim religious groups, two significant aspects of his rule remain controversial as relates to the conditions of Hindus in Bangladesh. The first was his refusal to return the premises of the Ramna Kali Mandir, historically the most important temple in Dhaka, to the religious body that owned the property. This centuries old Hindu temple was demolished by the Pakistan army during the Bangladesh Liberation War and around one hundred devotees murdered. Under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act it was determined that ownership of the property could not be established as there were no surviving members to claim inherited rights, and the land was handed over to the Dhaka Club.\n\nSecondly, state-authorized confiscation of Hindu owned property under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act was rampant during Mujib's rule, and as per the research conducted by Abul Barkat of Dhaka University, the Awami League party of Sheikh Mujib was the largest beneficiary of Hindu property transfer in the past 35 years of Bangladeshi independence. This was enabled considerably because of the particular turmoil and displacement suffered by Bangladeshi Hindus, who were the primary target of the Pakistan army's genocide, as well documented by international publications such as \"Time\" magazine and the \"New York Times\", and by the declassified Hamoodur Rahman Commission report. With almost 8 million displaced Hindus and more than 200,000 Hindu victims of genocide, it was difficult to establish direct ownership of property within legally specified timeframes. This caused much bitterness among Bangladeshi Hindus, particularly given the public stance of the regime's commitment to secularism and communal harmony.\n\nLargely because of these and other factors, such as the lack of attention to the Human Rights Violations of Hindus in the country, the Hindu population of Bangladesh started to decline through migration.\n\nPresident Ziaur Rahman abandoned the constitutional provision for secularism and began to introduce Islamic symbolism in all spheres of national life (such as official seals and the constitutional preamble). Zia brought back the multi-party system thus allowing organizations such as Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (an offshoot of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan) to regroup and contest elections.\n\nIn 1988 President Hussein Mohammed Ershad declared Islam to be the State Religion of Bangladesh. Though the move was protested by students and left-leaning political parties and minority groups, to this date neither the regimes of the BNP or Awami League has challenged this change and it remains in place.\n\nIn 1990, the Ershad regime was widely blamed for negligence (and some human rights analysis allege active participation) in the anti-Hindu riots following the Babri Mosque incident in India, the largest communal disturbances since Bangladesh independence, as a means of diverting attention from the rapidly increasing opposition to his rule. Many Hindu temples, Hindu neighbourhoods and shops were attacked and damaged including, for the first time since 1971, the Dhakeshwari temple. The atrocities were brought to the West's attention by many Bangladeshis, including Taslima Nasrin and her book Lajja which translated into English means \"shame\".\n\nHindus were first attacked in mass on 1992 by Islamic fundamentalists. More than 200 temples were destroyed. Hindus were attacked and many women were raped and killed. The events were widely seen as a repercussion against the razing of the Babri Mosque in India. Taslima Nasrin wrote her novel \"Lajja\" (The Shame) based on this persecution of Hindus by Islamic extremists. The novel centers on the suffering of the patriotic anti-Indian and pro-Communist Datta family, where the daughter is raped and killed while financially they end up losing everything.\nProminent political leaders frequently fall back on \"Hindu bashing\" in an attempt to appeal to extremist sentiment and to stir up communal passions. In one of the most notorious utterances of a mainstream Bangladeshi figure, the immediate past Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while leader of the opposition in 1996, declared that the country was at risk of hearing \"uludhhwani\" (a Hindu custom involving women's ululation) from mosques, replacing the azaan (Muslim call to prayer) (e.g., see Agence-France Press report of 18 November 1996, \"Bangladesh opposition leader accused of hurting religious sentiment\").\n\nAfter the election of 2001, when a right-wing coalition including two Islamist parties (Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and Islami Oikya Jote) led by the pro-Islamic right wing Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) came to power, many minority Hindus and liberal secularist Muslims were attacked by a section of the governing regime. Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus were believed to have fled to neighbouring India to escape the violence unleashed by activists sympathetic to the new government. Many Bangladeshi Muslims played an active role in documenting atrocities against Hindus during this period.\n\nThe new government also clamped down on attempts by the media to document alleged atrocities against non-Muslim minorities following the election. Severe pressure was put on newspapers and other media outside of government control through threats of violence and other intimidation. Most prominently, the Muslim journalist and human rights activist Shahriyar Kabir was arrested on charges of treason on his return from India where he had been interviewing Hindu refugees from Bangladesh; this was by the Bangladesh High Court and he was subsequently freed.\n\nThe fundamentalists and right-wing parties such as the BNP and Jatiya Party often portray Hindus as being sympathetic to India, and transferring economic resources to India, contributing to a widespread perception that Bangladeshi Hindus are disloyal to the state. Also, the right wing parties claim the Hindus to be backing the Awami League.\nAs widely documented in international media, Bangladesh authorities have had to increase security to enable Bangladeshi Hindus to worship freely following widespread attacks on places of worship and devotees.\n\nAfter recent bombings in Bangladesh by the Islamic fundamentalists, the government has taken steps to strengthen the security during various minority celebrations, specially during Durga Puja and Rathayatra.\n\nOn October 2006, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom published a report titled 'Policy Focus on Bangladesh', said that since its last election, 'Bangladesh has experienced growing violence by religious extremists, intensifying concerns expressed by the country's religious minorities'. The report further stated that Hindus are particularly vulnerable in a period of rising violence and extremism, whether motivated by religious, political or criminal factors, or some combination. The report noted that Hindus had multiple disadvantages against them in Bangladesh, such as perceptions of dual loyalty with respect to India and religious beliefs that are not tolerated by the politically dominant Islamic Fundamentalists of the BNP. Violence against Hindus has taken place \"in order to encourage them to flee in order to seize their property\". The previous reports of the Hindu American Foundation were acknowledged and confirmed by this non-partisan report.\n\nOn 2 November 2006, USCIRF criticized Bangladesh for continuing persecution of minority Hindus. It also urged the Bush administration to get Dhaka to ensure protection of religious freedom and minority rights before Bangladesh's next national elections in January 2007.\n\nIn 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal indicted several Jamaat members for war crimes against Hindus during the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities. In retaliation, violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh was instigated by the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu shops and homes, rape and abductions of Hindu women and vandalising and desecrating the Hindu temples.\n\nAccording to the BJHM report in 2017 alone, at least 107 people of the Hindu community were killed and 31 fell victims to enforced disappearance 782 Hindus were either forced to leave the country or threatened to leave. Besides, 23 were forced to get converted into other religions.\nAt least 25 Hindu women and children were raped, while 235 temples and statues vandalized during the year.\nThe total number of atrocities happened with the Hindu community in 2017 is 6474. During the 2019 Bangladesh elections, eight houses belonging to Hindu families on fire in Thakurgaon alone.\n\nIn April 2019, two idols of Hindu goddesses, Lakshmi and Saraswati, have been vandalized by unidentified miscreants at a newly-constructed temple in Kazipara of Brahmanbaria. In the same month, several idols of Hindu gods in two temples in Madaripur Sadar upazila which were under construction were desecrated by miscreants.\n\nEven after the decline of Hindu population in Bangladesh from 13.5% in 1974, just after the independence, Hindus were at around 9.2% of the population in 2001 according to government estimates following the census. However, Hindus accounted for only four members of the 300 member parliament following the 2001 elections through direct election; this went up to five following a by-election victory in 2004. Significantly, of the 50 seats reserved for women that are directly nominated by the Prime Minister, not a single one was allotted to a Hindu. The political representation is not at all satisfactory and several Hindu advocacy groups in Bangladesh have demanded a return to a communal electorate system as existed during the Pakistan period, to enable a more equitable and proportionate representation in parliament, or a reserved quota since persecution of Hindus has continued since 1946.\n\nDespite their dwindling population, Hindus still yield considerable influence because of their geographical concentration in certain regions. They form a majority of the electorate in at least two parliamentary constituencies (Khulna-1 and Gopalganj-3) and account for more than 25% in at least another thirty. For this reason, they are often the deciding factor in parliamentary elections where victory margins can be extremely narrow. It is also frequently alleged that this is a prime reason for many Hindus being prevented from voting in elections, either through intimidating actual voters, or through exclusion in voter list revisions.\n\n\n\nCurrent 11th Jatiya Sangsad has 18 Hindu MP \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father Mykolas had left Lithuania to escape possible induction into the Russian army. Moving to the United States, he briefly lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before moving to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin to work for a cousin as a farm hand, then moving to Cicero after finding work in a Chicago steel mill. By the time his fourth son, Paulius, arrived, he had started cleaning windows for the Leo Sheridan Co., a job he would hold for 30 years.\n\nAfter attending Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, Paul was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Chicago on May 3, 1947, and served parish assignments with both St. Christina's and Holy Cross Church on the city's south side. By 1949, he had been appointed to the archdiocese's matrimonial tribunal, which processed applications to have marriages annulled.\n\nBeginning in 1950, Marcinkus began to fulfill special assignments for the Vatican and became friendly with Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini, later Pope Paul VI, while studying canon law at the Gregorian University. Upon earning his degree in 1953, he completed the two-year program for prospective diplomats at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and was assigned to Bolivia in 1955 and to Canada four years later, serving as secretary in the nunciature of the Holy See in both instances.\n\nBeginning in December 1959, he worked at the Secretariat of State in Rome and served on occasion as an interpreter for Pope John XXIII. Under Pope Paul VI, Marcinkus became the prime English translator and helped manage arrangements for papal overseas trips. In addition, his height and muscular build enabled him to serve as a bodyguard for Paul VI, earning him the nickname \"The Gorilla.\"\n\nOn January 6, 1969, he received his episcopal consecration as Titular Archbishop of Horta. Two months later, he refused to allow Secret Service agents to be present during a private audience between Paul and U.S. President Richard Nixon, saying \"I'll give you 60 seconds to get out of here or you can explain to the president why the pope could not see him today.\"\n\nIn 1979, Marcinkus was reported as having been targeted by the Red Brigades, a far-left terrorist group, for possible kidnap or assassination after his address and other documents were found in the apartment of two group members, Valerio Morucci and Adriana Faranda.\n\nOn September 26, 1981, Marcinkus was appointed Pro-President of Vatican City, a title roughly equivalent to vice president.\n\nIn 1982, he thwarted an assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II in Fátima, Portugal, when Juan Maria Fernandez y Krohn, a deranged priest, attacked the pope with a bayonet.\n\nMarcinkus was the president of the Institute for the Works of Religion, also known as the Vatican Bank, from 1971 to 1989. As early as April 24, 1973, Marcinkus was questioned in his Vatican office by federal prosecutor William Aronwald and Bill Lynch, head of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the United States Department of Justice, about his involvement in the delivery of $14.5 million worth of counterfeit bonds to the Vatican in July 1971, part of a total request of $950 million stated in a letter on Vatican notepaper.\n\nHis name and the letter had arisen during the investigation of an international gangster, who eventually served 12 years in prison. Marcinkus said \"he considered the charges against him serious but not based enough on fact that he would violate the Vatican Bank's confidentiality to defend himself...back in the States it was agreed on the highest levels that the case against Marcinkus could not be pursued any further.\"\n\nIn July 1982, Marcinkus was implicated in financial scandals being reported on the front pages of newspapers and magazines throughout Europe, particularly the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano, in which Propaganda Due (aka \"P2\"), a Masonic Lodge, was involved (Marcinkus had been a director of Ambrosiano Overseas, based in Nassau, Bahamas, and had been involved with Ambrosiano's chairman, financier Roberto Calvi, for a number of years). He also was involved with Michele Sindona, who had links with the Mafia.\n\nUpon the election of Pope John Paul II in 1978, Marcinkus was promoted within the Vatican bank and remained in office for several years before the scandal widened, after the body of Calvi, whose Banco Ambrosiano had dealt with Marcinkus, was found hanging under London's Blackfriars Bridge in June 1982. The death of Calvi was seen by some as symbolic because Propaganda Due referred to themselves as the Black Friars. Adding to the troubles, journalist Mino Pecorelli, who had been investigating Marcinkus, the Vatican Bank and ties to organized crime, was murdered in 1979. Marcinkus himself was never charged with a crime.\n\nHe stepped aside as head of the Vatican Bank soon after, with a board of laymen assuming control of the bank. The Vatican eventually paid £145 million in a settlement with creditors, with Marcinkus observing in 1986 that: \"You can't run the Church on Hail Marys.\" Marcinkus later said that he was misquoted, what he actually said was: \"When my workers come to retire they expect a pension; it's no use my saying to them. 'I'll pay you 400 Hail Marys.\"\n\nHe resigned his position on October 30, 1990.\n\nIn 1984, Marcinkus was named by investigative journalist David Yallop in his book \"In God's Name\" as a possible accomplice in the supposed murder of Pope John Paul I. Yallop made allegations regarding a number of suspects, involving the Mafia and Freemasonry. \nIn 2019, nephew of Lucky Luciano Anthony Raimondi claims he helped his cardinal cousin Paul Marcinkus killing the pope.\n\nIn 2008, the case of a missing person was reopened with claims by Sabrina Minardi, a former girlfriend of the boss of the Banda della Magliana gang, Enrico De Pedis. She said that Emanuela Orlandi, daughter of a Vatican employee, was kidnapped on orders of Marcinkus to send a message, and was later killed.\n\nMarcinkus returned to the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1990 before retiring to Arizona, where he lived as an assistant parish priest at St. Clement of Rome Church in Sun City. He declined to discuss his role in the Ambrosiano scandal. Archbishop Marcinkus died in Sun City, Arizona, aged 84, of undisclosed causes.\n\nMarcinkus was played by actor Rutger Hauer in the Italian film \"The Bankers of God\". In Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather Part III\", actor Donal Donnelly portrayed Archbishop Gilday, a character based on Marcinkus.\n\nIn 2006, Marcinkus was played by actor Jacques Sernas in the Italian TV Serie \"\"\n\n.In 2006, Tom Flannery's one-man play \"Marcinkus\" premiered in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In 2016, Paul Marcinkus was portrayed by actor Randall Paul in Roberto Faenza's film \"La Verita Sta in Cielo\".\n\n Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (2 September 1983)\n\n\n"}

It provided residential line rental services, internet services, IT services, security services, cable TV/cable modem and mobile telephone services to 70,000 subscribers on its network in Wellington, Christchurch and Kapiti. Overall the company had around 200,000 customers.\n\nIn 2004, TelstraClear began offering residential line HomePlan services including broadband outside those areas where it has its own network, reselling the ADSL wholesale product from Telecom New Zealand, and investing millions in local loop unbundling, which entailed TelstraClear installing its own equipment in Telecom exchanges (the Telecom infrastructure business later became Chorus Limited).\n\nTelstraClear had its beginnings in New Zealand with Kiwi Cable in the Kapiti Coast district, Clear Communications in 1990, and Telstra New Zealand in 1996.\n\nTelstra NZ slowly expanded its operations in the business market bundling Telecom New Zealand services distributed as a reseller with its own network services. It installed switches in Auckland and Wellington to manage incoming and outgoing international traffic and maintained an interconnect agreement with Telecom New Zealand and is likely to have had others with companies such as Clear Communications.\n\nIn 1999 Saturn Communications was sold by its parent company, Austar United Communications, to a new joint venture with Telstra that became known as TelstraSaturn.\n\nTelstraClear was then created by the merger of Telstra's TelstraSaturn and Clear Communications in December 2001. Austar United Communications held an initial investment of 42% in TelstraClear before selling it back to Telstra. In March 2003, TelstraClear unveiled a new advertising campaign highlighting what the company saw as the increased competition and benefits the merger would create for New Zealand.\n\nTelstraClear had plans to expand its cable network into Auckland, but cancelled the plan in 2004 due to community opposition and questions about the business case.\n\nIn 2004 TelstraClear made its first acquisition in the IT market with the purchase of Sytec, mainly for its IP telephony and security skills, in particular the specialist managed security subsidiary DMZGlobal. In 2007 Sytec was formally introduced into the TelstraClear's enterprise and government division and the brand retired, but the DMZGlobal brand was retained and invested in.\n\nIn July 2012, Vodafone New Zealand announced plans to acquire TelstraClear. Vodafone approached Telstra to purchase TelstraClear for a payment of $840 million and $450 million that TelstraClear had in its accounts. On 30 October 2012 the Commerce Commission approved the takeover bid, and on 31 October the sale was completed. The final trading day of TelstraClear was 31 March 2013.

Both offered nationwide dialup and DSL service, resold over Telecom's DSL lines and also over unbundled exchanges. A number of their dial-up IP numbers were blacklisted as abusers by sites such as DSBL.\n\nVDSL2\nOnly available to business customers in the 'on-net' areas, this technology was used to deliver the product BizBroadband and BizNet, as well as the IP Voice products (IP FeatureLine, IP Connect, IP Gateway, IP Clarity).\n\nDOCSIS (cable)\nTelstraClear also offered DOCSIS cable modem internet access within TelstraClear's own (built) network. TelstraClear offered standard speeds of up to 15 Mbit/s, and TelstraClear have also released 100 Mbit/s plans with 10Mbit/s upload.\n\nSince late 2009, new connections were only available on Clearnet.\n\nWith the acquisition of Sytec and the formation of Enterprise and Government division, TelstraClear provided managed network solutions, ICT services (such as desktop and device management and co-location), enterprise comms and contact center solutions. In addition under the DMZGlobal brand TelstraClear provided Internet security, managed security, and security consulting services.\n\nTelstraClear operated the Hybrid Fibre Cable pay television network under the brand \"InHomeTV\". It was developed by Saturn Communications in Wellington, Kapiti and Christchurch, prior to the sale to Telstra, and formerly known as Saturn TV. The network infrastructure includes twisted pair cabling used for residential and business local telephone service.\n\nProgramming is sourced from SKY Network Television following an agreement in 2002 and also locally received and sourced channels. The agreement allowed TelstraClear to distribute and bill for services provided by SKY Network Television on its own InHome digital TV network.\n\nIn September 2010, TelstraClear released their own PVR called the T-BOX. The launch followed the release by parent company Telstra (AU) of a similar product.\n\nAs of June 2011 TelstraClear ceased all analogue transmission on its cable network.\n\nIn May 2012 TelstraClear started sourcing its own Pay Per View movies and changes its branding to InHome Movies.\n\nInHomeTV was available on TelstraClear's HFC Cable network in Wellington, Christchurch and Kapiti.

Up until 1913, the entrance used was the exodus of a spring which drained into the White River. However, a dam completed in 1913 on the White River closed off this entrance. In 1940, a second entrance was created after a severe storm passed through the area.

Soon word of the largest opening of Bluespring Caverns spread and the Colglazier family welcomed visitors from around the world as others descended on the small farm to explore the caverns. George Colglazier and his wife, Eva, lived on their family farm and welcomed visitors to the caverns until the death of George Colglazier in the early 1980s. Neither Colglazier nor his wife ever profited from Bluespring Caverns. They made their living as hard-working dairy farmers. They freely allowed cave explorers on their property and asked them to obey one rule, \"not to destroy or remove from the caverns\".\n\nThe cave was formed in two types of limestone, separated by a thin layer of shale. The two types of limestone are:\n\n\nThe cave remains a constant 54 °F (14 °C) temperature throughout the year.\n\nThe cave is host to a number of species, including crayfish, salamanders, crickets, spiders, and beetles. Most notable among these is the rare sightless Northern Cavefish, which is abundant in this cave system. A small number of bats make this cave their home, especially during winter. However, the frequent flooding of this cave system discourages bat habitation year-round.\n\nVisitation to the cave is controlled by Bluespring Caverns Park, a commercial corporation. The featured activity is an hour-long boat ride on the subterranean river in a 17-person boat equipped with lighting. This ride is offered seasonally in the months of April through October. The park also offers overnight adventures for organized youth groups from October through April.\n\nBluespring Caverns are one of four show caves in Indiana. The other three are Marengo Cave, Wyandotte Caves, and Squire Boone Caverns. Twin caves, located in Spring Mill State Park, about 15 minutes south of Bluespring Caverns, near Mitchell, Indiana offers a 20-minute boat tour into the cave which goes back about . Twin Caves is owned and operated by the state of Indiana and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources\n\n\n\n"}

He was born into the minor nobility and in 1755 joined the Laon militia which was soon sent to fight in the Seven Years' War. After transferring into the regular army as an ensign, he was wounded at Warburg in 1760. He fought in the Spanish-Portuguese War in 1762. He married in 1779 after a promotion to captain. A newly minted major in 1789, the French Revolution sped up promotion so that he was colonel of the regiment in 1792. After leading Army of Italy troops in a number of actions, he became a general of brigade in 1793 and a general of division the following year.\n\nSérurier led a division in Napoleon Bonaparte's Italian campaign of 1796, except during bouts of illness. He especially distinguished himself at the Battle of Mondovì and the Siege of Mantua. In 1799, he again fought in Italy during the War of the Second Coalition at Verona, Magnano and Cassano, being captured in the latter action. After being paroled, he supported Napoleon's rise to political power in the Coup of 18 Brumaire in late 1799. The apex of his career occurred on 19 May 1804 when Napoleon appointed him a Marshal of the Empire. His active military career over, Sérurier served in the French Senate and was ennobled by Napoleon. In 1814 as the First French Empire was crumbling, he burned all the many flags captured by the French armies. His troops called him the \"Virgin of Italy\" for his rigorous standards of discipline and honesty in an army known for generals who enriched themselves by plundering the conquered territories. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 24.\n\nSérurier was born at Laon on 8 December 1742, the son of Mathieu-Guillaume Sérurier. The family formed part of the minor provincial nobility, his father holding the title Seigneur de Sort and the job of mole-catcher to the king's breeding stud. After 1750 his father's title became Seigneur de Saint-Gobert. Sérurier got a good education and was of sober character. He received a commission as lieutenant in the Laon militia battalion on 25 March 1755, his uncle being the unit's commander. He transferred to the Soissons militia battalion on 12 June 1758. When he heard that the Laon battalion was called to serve in the Seven Years' War he switched back to his old unit on 30 November 1758. After sustaining a bayonet wound, he transferred into the Mazarin Infantry Regiment as a cadet on 1 October 1759. At the Battle of Warburg on 31 July 1760, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel surprised the French under Louis Nicolas Victor de Felix d'Ollieres, Count Du Muy. While defending a critical post, Sérurier was hit on the right side of his face by a bullet, which broke his jaw and left a lasting scar. The injury also cost him most of his teeth. He was promoted to second lieutenant on 25 April 1762.\n\nSérurier's regiment was ordered to Bayonne where it joined a force under Charles Juste de Beauvau, Prince of Craon. These troops entered Spain on 3 June 1762 to take part in the Spanish-Portuguese War. The first battalion, in which Sérurier served, participated in the siege of Almeida which fell to the Franco-Spanish on 25 August 1762. The unit returned to France in November that year and after the Treaty of Paris was renamed the Beauce Regiment. After the peace Sérurier was demoted to \"sous-lieutenant\" and spent six years as a drill instructor. He was promoted to second lieutenant again on 21 February 1767 and was shipped to Corsica in 1770. The Republic of Genoa transferred Corsica to France in 1764 but Pasquale Paoli led an insurrection against the occupiers which resulted in a few skirmishes. His superiors called Sérurier an \"excellent officer\" but he was not promoted to first lieutenant until 28 February 1778. A year later he was promoted to captain. He married Louise-Marie-Madeleine Itasse on 3 July 1779. Her father was the Registrar of the bail bondsmen of Laon.\n\nOn 29 July 1781 Sérurier was awarded the Order of Saint-Louis. On 10 May 1782 he assumed the rank of captain commandant and on 1 June 1783 he took command of the regiment's Chasseur company. Irked by the lack of promotion, he asked to retire on pension on 8 September 1788. His commanding officer argued to retain such a good officer and Sérurier transferred into the Médoc Regiment as a major on 17 May 1789. He became lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1791. Since the French Revolution the garrison at Perpignan became agitated so the regiment was sent there to calm down the other troops. Instead, the Médoc Regiment itself became affected by the troubles. On 23 July 1791, fearing that Sérurier was about to leave the country with the regiment's colors, a body of soldiers removed them from his quarters. In January 1792, 19 officers from the regiment emigrated to Spain. A story existed that Sérurier and a companion tried to flee to Spain but were nearly caught by a patrol and only his companion made it across the border. In June 1792 the Médoc, renamed the 70th Infantry Regiment, marched to the Camp of Tournoux in the Alps. Sérurier became the commanding officer of the 70th with the rank of colonel on 7 August 1792.\n\nOn 29 September 1792, a 10,000-man division under Jacques Bernard d'Anselme crossed the Var River and occupied Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. This force was part of the Army of the Midi which was split on 1 October 1792, with the troops on the Alpine front becoming the Army of the Alps. On 7 November d'Anselme's division became the Army of Italy, which included the 70th Regiment. At about this time Sérurier was arrested for harboring royalist sentiments, but Paul Barras got his rank restored. On 19 May 1793, the new army commander Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet sent him with a column to occupy Saint-Sauveur-sur-Tinée. Sérurier moved north up the Tinée River and captured Isola on the 21st. With 3,000 troops, he attacked the Col de Raus west of Belvédère but was repulsed on 8 June. During the First Battle of Saorgio he led a major attack on the Massif de l'Authion on 12 June, but it was defeated with losses of 280 dead and 1,252 wounded. At the end of July Brunet made another assault on Massif de l'Authion while Sérurier attacked the Col de Raus again but both efforts failed. The representatives on mission were pleased with Sérurier's performance and nominated him general of brigade on 25 June; the promotion was confirmed on 22 August 1793. Meanwhile, Brunet was arrested and executed on 15 November 1793.\n\nIn September 1793 the Sardinian army tried to recapture the County of Nice. The French right flank held its ground, but on the left Sérurier gave up the east bank of the Vésubie River and fell back to Utelle on 10 September. Jacques François Dugommier took command of the left wing three days later and Sérurier took charge of the right wing of the Army of the Alps at Entrevaux. Sérurier was arrested for retreating too much and for being of noble blood. He was reinstated after the representatives on mission and the War Minister Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte termed the charges as unimportant while the citizens of Laon sent a petition vouching for his patriotism. After the fighting petered out in the December snow, Sérurier's division was transferred to form the left flank of the Army of Italy. In January 1794 he was denounced for listening to aristocratic songs and for not caring about desertions, but Bouchotte and the representatives brushed aside these charges. Under army commander Pierre Jadart Dumerbion a French offensive began on 5 April and Oneglia was seized. André Masséna commanded the 20,000-man main column on the right wing while François Macquard directed the center division and Pierre Dominique Garnier led the left division. Sérurier, who commanded Garnier's left brigade, reoccupied Isola and went on to seize the Colle delle Finestre against weak resistance. In the Second Battle of Saorgio on 24 April 1794, Masséna defeated Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi, the French inflicting 2,800 casualties on the Sardinians while losing 1,500 killed and wounded. In the aftermath, Macquard occupied Saorge and the Col de Tende while Masséna held Ormea in the Tanaro valley. At the end of June, Sérurier took part in a small operation in the Valle Stura di Demonte.\n\nIn September 1794 the Sardinians and Austrians advanced to Carcare, threatening to cut the French link to Genoa, where supplies were obtained. Advised by his artillery chief Napoleon Bonaparte, Dumerbion struck back on 15 September. While Sérurier feinted at Vinadio on the left and Macquard feinted at Limone Piemonte in the center, Masséna mounted the main thrust on the right. In the First Battle of Dego on 21 September, 18,000 French troops beat Olivier, Count of Wallis and 8,000 Austro-Sardinians. Though the allies escaped encirclement, the French later seized the port of Vado Ligure. Dumerbion and Garnier both recommended Sérurier's promotion and he was nominated general of division on 22 December 1794. Given command of the right flank division in place of Masséna who was sick, his brigadiers were Barthélemy Catherine Joubert and Sextius Alexandre François de Miollis.\n\nOn 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer replaced the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was \"a very good officer, devoted to his duties; his patriotism has been attacked in the time of Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious from all these charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army.\" Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following morning when he attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. Not only was he a good soldier, but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps. François Christophe Kellermann then in command of both armies, wrote, \"It is to the coolness and courage of this excellent officer that was due the success of this glorious day.\"\n\nOn 23–24 November 1795, the Battle of Loano was fought. Schérer deployed Pierre Augereau with 6,961 troops on the right, Masséna with 13,276 men in the center and Sérurier with 5,155 soldiers on the left. The plan called for Sérurier to pin down the Allied right while Masséna broke through the center and rolled up the Allied left with the help of Augereau. By luck, Wallis replaced De Vins in command of the Allies on 22 November. That day Sérurier's attack on the Colle San Bernardo was repulsed but it tied down Colli's division. The plan was carried out with success. Masséna and Augereau both defeated the forces in front of them. The Austro-Sardinians suffered losses of 3,000 killed and wounded, 4,000 prisoners, 48 guns and five colors while French losses numbered 2,500 killed and wounded and 500 captured. Snow soon compelled both armies to withdraw into winter quarters. The French soldiers were in a wretched state, with very little food; they became insubordinate and the generals quarreled. Sérurier got into a dispute with Schérer and nearly left the army. On 18 March 1796 Sérurier's division refused to obey orders.\n\nAfter the winter campaign, Schérer placed the divisions in the positions where they would start the 1796 campaign. From right to left, they were Masséna with two divisions on the coast, Augereau on the Bormida River, Sérurier on the Tanaro, Macquard at the Col de Tende and Garnier on the far left. On 27 March 1796 Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy. At this date Sérurier was 53 years old with 40 years of military service. He applied to retire on a pension due to his age, health and wounds, but after meeting Bonaparte he decided to stay. Masséna later wrote that Bonaparte did not impress his generals at first. Then the new commander put on his hat and sharply questioned them; the generals went away believing that they had a true leader at last. Bonaparte's plan was to mass over 20,000 men under Masséna and Augereau near Carcare where the Austrian and Sardinian armies linked. Sérurier's division would join the others near Ceva as they moved west. His 9,448-strong division consisted of the 39th, 69th and 85th Line Infantry Demi-brigades.\n\nIn the Montenotte Campaign, the French won victories at Montenotte, Millesimo and Dego between 11 and 15 April. In the Battle of Ceva Colli's Sardinians repelled Augereau's attack but they retreated to the west when Sérurier's division appeared. Colli detailed Jean-Gaspard Dichat de Toisinge with 8,000 Sardinians and 15 guns to defend San Michele Mondovi against a French attack. On 19 April, Sérurier formed his division into two 3,000-man brigades under Pascal Antoine Fiorella and Jean Joseph Guieu plus a reserve under his personal command. The Corsaglia River was unfordable due to the spring thaw and the French attack soon stalled. However, some of Guieu's skirmishers found an unguarded footbridge and made a lodgement on the west bank. The French captured San Michele but the unpaid, hungry soldiers went on a looting spree. Led by a company of Swiss troops, Colli organized a counterattack which drove Sérurier's division out of the town, though Guieu's brigade maintained its bridgehead. The repulse cost the French about 600 casualties while the Sardinians lost 300.\n\nColli's troops withdrew toward Mondovì on the night of 20 April, but the move was soon discovered by the French who caught up with them at Vicoforte at mid-morning. In the Battle of Mondovì on 21 April, the brigades of Fiorella, Guieu and Elzéar Auguste Cousin de Dommartin fought their way into Vicoforte and routed the Sardinians. Dichat was killed and Henri Christian Michel de Stengel mortally wounded. Mondovì surrendered in the late afternoon. There was no looting but large requisitions of food were made from the town. Auguste de Marmont recalled of Sérurier, \"To form his men into three columns, put himself at the head of the central one, throw out a cloud of skirmishers, and march at the double, sword in hand, ten paces in front of his column: that is what he did. A fine spectacle, that of an old general, resolute and decided, whose vigor was revived by the presence of the enemy. I accompanied him in this attack, the success of which was complete\". On 28 April the Armistice of Cherasco was signed, taking Sardinia out of the war. \nIn May 1796, Bonaparte detailed Sérurier to demonstrate with his division at Valenza while the rest of the army crossed the Po River near Piacenza. After the Battle of Lodi, Bonaparte divided the Army of Italy into a cavalry reserve and four divisions including one under Sérurier. During the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May, his division feinted at the upper Mincio River while other troops made the main thrust against Johann Peter Beaulieu's army at Valeggio sul Mincio. On 1 June, the 4,700-strong division took position on the north side of the fortress of Mantua. On 8 June, Sérurier, artillerist Augustin de Lespinasse and engineer Francois, marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat reconnoitered the fortress. Two days later Bonaparte put Sérurier in charge of the Siege of Mantua with about 8,000 soldiers. Soon after, Bonaparte wrote to the French Directory, \"I shall not speak to you of the conduct of the intrepid General Sérurier, whose military reputation is established, and to whom we owe, amongst other things since the campaign began, the victory of Mondovi\". Because of the approach of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's Austrian army, the siege was raised on 31 July, the heavy cannons were buried and the division withdrew behind the Oglio River. Sérurier then became feverish with malaria, so that Fiorella and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne directed the division during the Battle of Castiglione. The general returned to France to recuperate. On 14 August 1796 Bonaparte wrote a confidential assessment of his generals to the Directory. In it he wrote, \"Sérurier, fights like a private, takes nothing on himself, firm; has not a good enough opinion of his troops, is ill\".\n\nAfter his recovery Sérurier took command at Livorno (Leghorn) but he was thrilled to get the order to return to the army. On 27 December 1796 he resumed command of the Mantua siege corps, replacing Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine who had also become ill. The corps consisted of 10,000 men in two divisions under Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Claude Dallemagne. On 14–15 January 1797 Bonaparte defeated József Alvinczi in the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting terrible losses on the Austrians. Meanwhile, a relief column under Giovanni Marchese di Provera reached the north side of Mantua and on 16 January there was a battle. The Mantua garrison launched a sortie led by Karl Philipp Sebottendorf that made progress at first but was beaten back by reinforcements under Claude Perrin Victor. At the same time, Sérurier and 1,500 troops at La Favorita Palace blocked Provera from joining the garrison. By noon Provera was hemmed in by French reinforcements and at 2:00 pm he surrendered to Sérurier with 7,000 men, 22 field guns, a pontoon train and a food convoy. Afterward, Sérurier got into a dispute with Dumas, who had commanded armies but was now a mere division commander. Angry that his contributions were not recognized, Dumas sent an abusive note to the army chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier and was demoted by Bonaparte. On 30 January, Wurmser began negotiations with Sérurier for the capitulation of Mantua; this was signed on 2 February 1797 by the two generals. The articles permitted Wurmser, his staff, his generals, 700 soldiers and six artillery pieces to go free, but 16,324 men of the garrison became prisoners of war.\n\nFor the spring 1797 campaign, Bonaparte organized his army into eight divisions of which the 3rd Division under Sérurier counted 6,543 soldiers. In the Battle of Valvasone on 16 March, Bonaparte drove back the rear guard of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. During the operation Sérurier's division was in reserve, but in the subsequent advance it was on the right flank while Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's division was in the center and Guieu's division was on the left flank. On 19 March Bernadotte attacked Gradisca d'Isonzo and was repulsed. After Sérurier's division swung around the south side of Gradisca and gained the heights in the rear of the town, the garrison surrendered. The French captured four battalions of Austrian infantry totaling 2,500 soldiers, 10 guns and eight colors. While Bernadotte continued advancing to the east, Guieu's division followed by Sérurier turned north in pursuit of a column under Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza. At this time Sérurier fell ill and command of his division passed to Louis François Jean Chabot. Trapped between Massena and Guieu, Bajalics was forced to surrender with 4,000 men in the Battle of Tarvis. After recovering, Sérurier resumed command of his division at Graz on 20 April and after the Treaty of Leoben the unit withdrew from Austria and took position at Sacile.\n\nOn 3 June 1797 Bonaparte notified the French government that he was sending Sérurier with 22 captured colors. He wrote that he, \"has in the last two campaigns displayed as much talent as bravery and patriotism ... General Sérurier is extremely severe with himself: he is sometimes so with others. A strict friend of discipline, and of the order and virtues most necessary to the maintenance of society, he disdains intrigue and intriguers, which has sometimes made him enemies amongst those men who are always ready to accuse of unpatriotism any one who wishes to see them submitted to their superiors\". He was received in Paris by a large audience of government officials on 28 June who he assured of his loyalty and that of his soldiers. He was back with his division on 9 August and missed the Coup of 18 Fructidor. A little later Louis Desaix described him, \"tall, 55 years old ... honest, estimable in every respect, considered to be an aristocrat but supported by General Bonaparte, who values and admires him\". Venice was occupied by French troops but by the recent treaty was to be handed over to Austria. Bonaparte ordered Sérurier to carry out the unpleasant job of removing all military stores and ships as well as all works of art. Over the objection of the Austrians and the inhabitants, the city was thoroughly plundered. Although he was the target of anger and abuse, Sérurier did not personally benefit from the looting and did his best to prevent others from doing so. He confiscated the salt and biscuits in the Venice arsenal but that was to raise money to pay his soldiers. In the same army, Masséna and Augereau were notorious for looting for personal gain, and many lesser officers also did it. Sérurier earned such a reputation for honesty that his soldiers called him the \"Virgin of Italy\".\n\nEarly in 1798 Sérurier temporarily commanded the divisions left in Italy where he had his hands full trying to calm unpaid soldiers who were on the verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria because he was too old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the \"Tyrol\" Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.\n\nThe outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition saw Schérer with 43,000 troops facing Paul Kray with 50,700 Austrians near Verona and 24,551 Russians under Alexander Suvorov marching up in support. Hoping to maul Kray before his Russians allies arrived, Schérer opted to attack. On 26 March 1799 in the Battle of Verona, the French gained a success at Pastrengo in the north, fought to a draw in front of Verona and were drubbed in the south at Legnago. In the north Sérurier drove the Austrians from Rivoli Veronese. On the 27th Kray rapidly shifted his strength to the north to assist his outnumbered right wing. Schérer shuffled the positions of his divisions which exhausted the soldiers without accomplishing anything. Belatedly, Schérer tried push his advantage in the north by sending Sérurier with 6,000 troops to advance on Verona from the north. On 30 March he ran into 15,000 Austrians at Parona and was badly defeated, losing 600 killed and wounded and 1,177 prisoners. Austrian casualties numbered only 390.\n\nThe Battle of Magnano on 5 April 1799 resulted in a French defeat. In the fighting Sérurier's division included three battalions each of the 18th, 29th and 30th Light Infantry Demi brigades, one battalion of the 1st Light, 180 grenadiers, 850 cavalry and 60 gunners. Both armies advanced, Sérurier successfully capturing Villafranca on the left. However, the divisions of Claude Perrin Victor and Paul Grenier were routed on the right. The French lost 7,000–8,000 men, seven colors and eight cannons, while Kray's army sustained 5,228 casualties. The worst casualty was the confidence of the French generals and the morale of the troops. When Schérer found that 12,000 Austrians were marching from the County of Tyrol to turn his north flank, he withdrew from the line of the Mincio, leaving 12,000 soldiers to defend Mantua. During the retreat many Italian and Swiss allies deserted from the Army of Italy.\n\nBy the end of April 1799, Schérer had 28,000 troops behind the Adda River, strung out on a line in length. The army was arranged in three small corps under Sérurier on the left, Grenier in the center and Victor on the right. By the morning of 27 April, Suvorov's Austro-Russian army had won crossings over the Adda at Capriate San Gervasio and Brivio. That day Jean Victor Marie Moreau replaced Schérer in command of the Army of Italy and the Allies defeated the French in the Battle of Cassano. After a struggle, Grenier's soldiers were beaten at Trezzo while the Austrians broke through Victor's defenses at Cassano. The French withdrew toward Milan leaving Sérurier isolated and without orders between Trezzo and Brivio. During the night the old veteran entrenched 2,600–4,000 troops in an all-around defense near Verderio. Finding the French in his path, Josef Philipp Vukassovich split his division into three columns and enveloped Sérurier's position. Vukassovich reported that his enemies put up a \"desperate\" fight, but out of ammunition, Sérurier surrendered on the evening of 28 April. By the terms of the capitulation, the general and his officers were released on parole to France. The Austrians reported capturing 243 officers and 3,487 soldiers. Vukassovich's troops suffered 2,750 casualties, over half of the Allied losses at Cassano. Sérurier's left wing near Lake Como escaped and rejoined the main army.\n\nSuvorov invited the captured general to dinner and found it impossible to coax any military information from him. The Russian wondered why such a reputable man should be fighting for the First French Republic. Sérurier retorted, \"My father, in giving me my sword, expressly ordered me to use it only to defend my country\". Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps considered Verderio to be the biggest blunder of Sérurier's career. He suggested that the general was accustomed to seeing Bonaparte save dire situations with brilliant maneuvers. When Moreau next saw the paroled general, he severely reprimanded him but later admitted to the government that Sérurier's only mistake was hewing to his orders too rigidly. This was the last time Sérurier led troops in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the French Directory sank in popularity after military defeats and mismanagement. Back in Paris, Sérurier became part of the Bonaparte faction, having seen nothing but disaster since serving under the military genius. Bonaparte launched the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 during which Sérurier led a reserve detachment of soldiers at the Pont-du-Jour. The next day, the coup almost collapsed when Bonaparte had to be rescued from the Council of Five Hundred. However, Lucien Bonaparte convinced the Council's own guard battalion that only a minority of members opposed his brother. These soldiers soon evicted the lawmakers from their own hall. During these events, Sérurier's troops arrived at Saint-Cloud and the general was heard addressing them, \"The wretches! They wished to kill General Bonaparte. Do not stir soldiers; wait until you get orders\". In the aftermath of the coup, Sérurier was put on a commission to determine how to use auxiliary battalions on 15 November 1799. He became a member of the Sénat conservateur (Senate) on 27 December.\n\nIn time Sérurier became vice-president of the Senate and in 1803 was appointed president of a commission that determined the border between France and Piedmont. In 1804 he was named governor of Les Invalides, a hospital and retirement home for veterans. On 19 May that year Emperor Napoleon named him an honorary Marshal of France. Out of 18 marshals appointed on this date, the other three honorary ones were Bon Adrien Jeannot de Moncey, François Christophe de Kellermann and Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon. Sérurier was awarded the Grand Eagle of the Légion d'Honneur and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Iron Crown. He was ennobled as a Count of the Empire in 1808 and granted a pension of 40,000 francs per year.\n\nOn 31 March 1814, upon the arrival of the Sixth Coalition armies at Paris, Sérurier publicly destroyed the 1,417 captured enemy flags and personally burned the sword and sash of Frederick the Great as to not let them fall into the Allies' hands. The restored King Louis XVIII made Sérurier a Peer of France, but he joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, when the former emperor briefly returned to power. This caused him to lose his post at Les Invalides and his marshal's salary after Napoleon's second downfall. Despite his Bonapartist sympathies, acting in his role of Peer, Sérurier voted in favour of the death penalty for Marshal Michel Ney.\n\nSérurier was restored to the dignity of marshal in 1819. He died on 21 December that year in Paris and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery. His body was not transferred to Les Invalides until 26 February 1847 SERURIER is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 24.\n\n"}
{"id": "1951726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951726", "title": "Leo Abse", "text": "Leo Abse\n\nLeopold Abse (22 April 1917 – 19 August 2008) was a Welsh lawyer and politician. He was a Welsh Labour MP for nearly 30 years, noted for promoting private member's bills to decriminalise male homosexual relations and liberalise the divorce laws. During his parliamentary career, Abse introduced more private member's bills than any other parliamentarian in the 20th century. After his retirement from Parliament he wrote several books about politics, based on his interest in psychoanalysis.\n\nLeo Abse was one of the sons of Rudolf Abse, a Jewish solicitor and cinema owner who lived in Cardiff. His maternal grandfather, Tobias, had emigrated to Wales from Siemiatycze, a Polish town then located within the Russian Empire. His grandmother came from Germany. Abse's younger brother Dannie Abse (1923–2014) was a poet, and his older brother Wilfred Abse (1915–2005) a psychoanalyst. He also had a sister, Hulda. Abse attended Howard Gardens High School in Cardiff and then the London School of Economics, where he studied law. Having joined the Labour Party in 1934, he clandestinely visited Spain during the closing months of the Spanish Civil War, in 1939.\n\nAbse married Marjorie Davies in 1955. They had two children: Tobias (now a Marxist historian) and Bathsheba. Marjorie died in 1996. His second marriage was to Ania Czepulkowska, in 2000, when Abse was 83 and Czepulkowska 33. Abse died on 19 August 2008. Some 10 years after her husband died, Mrs Czepulkowska-Abse broke her silence and spoke to the \"South Wales Argus\" and paid tribute to her husband. She confirmed that she is still living and working in London.\n\nDuring the Second World War Abse served in the Royal Air Force. He was in Cairo in 1944 when some of the British military personnel stationed there set up a \"Forces Parliament\" in which they debated the structure of society they wanted to see in the post-war world. Abse's idealistic left-wing views were fully in tune with the majority opinion among the lower ranks at its meetings, but the existence of the \"Parliament\" disturbed the senior officers. When Abse moved a motion supporting nationalization of the Bank of England he was arrested and the Forces Parliament was forcibly dissolved.\n\nAfter the end of the war Abse set up in practice as a solicitor in Cardiff. In 1951 he established his own law firm, Leo Abse & Cohen, which eventually grew to be the biggest in the city. He was also elected as Chairman of Cardiff Labour Party for two years from 1951, relinquishing the post when he was elected to Cardiff City Council. Abse fought the safe Conservative seat of Cardiff North in the 1955 general election, and was defeated.\n\nGranville West, the Labour MP for Pontypool and, like Abse, a solicitor, was awarded one of the first life peerages in 1958. Unusually for a town in the South Wales valleys at that time, the National Union of Mineworkers was not in control of the nomination of West's successor as Labour candidate, since Pontypool was a centre of the railway industry. Abse won the candidature and then won the seat at the by-election.\n\nIn the House of Commons Abse swiftly acquired a reputation for independence of spirit. He made a point of dressing flamboyantly on Budget day, and liked to drop references from Freudian psychotherapy into his speeches. Although his abilities might have taken him to high office, Abse remained a backbench MP. This factor, together with the fact that he had a safe seat, freed him from the restrictions that prevented most other MPs from taking up controversial subjects.\n\nIn 1963, Abse was selected in third place in the ballot for Private Member's Bills and introduced the Matrimonial Causes Bill, which simplified and made easier the legal process of divorce.\n\nIn 1957 the Wolfenden Report had recommended that the law be changed to decriminalise consenting male homosexual sex, but the government had taken no action. Abse began to promote a Bill to put Wolfenden's recommendations into law in February 1962. He kept pressing the issue and, after Humphry Berkeley (Conservative MP for Lancaster) lost his seat in the 1966 general election, Abse became the main sponsor for the legalisation. Although with the Labour landslide of 1966 there was a majority for the bill, it was still vulnerable but Abse persuaded Roy Jenkins to give the measure government time, which eventually saw the bill through onto the statute book.\n\nIn 1968 he was appointed to a Home Office advisory committee on the penal system. He was elected Chairman of the group of Welsh Labour MPs in 1971.\n\nIn 1973, Abse requested that the government ban the rock singer Alice Cooper and his group from performing in England, stating that Cooper was \"peddling the culture of the concentration camp\". Abse said: \"Pop is one thing, anthems of necrophilia are quite another\".\n\nAbse was chosen as chairman of a select committee on abortion from 1975 to 1977. His report advocated restrictions on abortion, including a lowering of the time limit within which abortion was legal from 28 weeks. He fought in the House of Commons for the enactment of his committee's recommendations, and continued the fight in 1980 when the Conservative MP John Corrie proposed a bill along similar lines: Abse refused to compromise on a limit of 24 weeks.\n\nAbse was an opponent of devolution when it was proposed in the late 1970s. He also proposed a separate referendum on whether the Shetland Islands ought to be part of a devolved Scotland. Abse was briefly chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee when it was first set up, but resigned in November 1981. One of the reasons he opposed devolution was that he thought some in Wales, whom he called \"fanatics\", wanted to use it to promote the use of the Welsh language.\n\nAbse added to his reputation for taking maverick stances by strongly urging that British forces be withdrawn from Northern Ireland. He opposed nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and criticised Margaret Thatcher for insisting that Argentina unconditionally surrender over the Falkland Islands. He supported British membership of the European Communities. His support for liberal divorce laws led him to propose a new 'child-centred' divorce reform in the early 1980s; the bill was piloted by Martin Stevens, Conservative MP for Fulham.\n\nAbse was elected for the renamed seat of Torfaen in 1983, but retired from Parliament in 1987. His nomination for a seat in the House of Lords was vetoed by Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe first of the books Abse wrote following retirement, \"Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice\" (1989), is a \"psycho-biography\" of Margaret Thatcher, taking its title from the observation that while Mrs Thatcher frequently referred to her father, she claimed not to have had anything to say to her mother from the age of 15.\n\nIn \"Wotan, My Enemy\" (1994) Abse took a psychoanalytic approach to explaining the origin of British hostility to Germany and the idea of the European Union. In \"The Man behind the Smile: Tony Blair and the Politics of Perversion\" (1996), Abse highlighted some of the aspects of Tony Blair that were later to be cited by Blair's opponents on the left. A revised edition, \"Tony Blair: The Man who Lost His Smile\" (2003), was published in the United States). In this edition Abse took the opportunity to claim that he had paid off a blackmailer who had been targeting a fellow Welsh MP George Thomas (Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983), on the basis of Thomas's (closeted) homosexuality.\n\nFinally, in \"Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love\" (1997), Abse drew attention to the fact that fellatio had been unspoken of a generation before but had come to be seen as an essential part of casual sexual relationships. He analysed the tendency for men to engage in risky behaviour by placing their trust in women whom they barely knew and linked it to political developments.\n\nA bust of Abse was unveiled at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff on 22 October 2009. The sculpture was funded by the firm of solicitors he founded, Leo Abse and Cohen, and was made by Abse's second cousin, Luke Shepherd.\n\nAbse was played by actor Anthony O'Donnell in the TV series \"A Very English Scandal\".\n\n\n\n"}

She was married to her brother Idrieus, who succeeded Artemisia in 351 BC and died in 344 BC. On the death of her husband Ada became satrap of Caria, but was expelled by her brother Pixodarus in 340 BC, who upon his death in 335 BC was succeeded by his own son-in-law, the Persian Orontobates.

Alexander accepted her offer and, in return, gave Ada formal command of the Siege of Halicarnassus.

It is the first chapter dealing with the ministry of Jesus with events taking place some three decades after the close of the infancy narrative related in the previous two chapters. The focus of this chapter is on the preaching of John the Baptist and the Baptism of Jesus.\n\nFor the first time since there are clear links with the Gospel of Mark. Many scholars are certain a good portion of this chapter is a reworking of Mark 1. The chapter also parallels Luke 3, also believed to be based on Mark 1. A number of passages shared by Luke and Matthew, but not found in Mark, are commonly ascribed to the hypothetical source 'Q'.\n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 17 verses.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n\nThe chapter opens with a portrait of John the Baptist. It describes his preaching, clothing, and diet, presenting him as a preacher in the wilderness prophesizing about the \"wrath to come\". The chapter then moves to a tirade, ascribed to John, against the Pharisees and Sadducees in which he warns them to repent. This includes the famous \"brood of vipers\" line at . Jesus then arrives from Galilee to be baptized, at a location about 70-80 miles from Nazareth, around the same section of Jordan river where Israelites crossed into the promised land under the leadership of Joshua. The chapter closes with the Baptism of Jesus, the voice of the Father, and the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove.\n\nIn the King James Version this chapter reads:\n\nIn those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,<br>\nAnd saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br>\nthis is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br>\nAnd the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.<br>\nThen went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,<br>\nAnd were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.<br>\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<br>\nBring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:<br>\nAnd think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.<br>\nAnd now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br>\nI indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:<br>\nWhose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.<br>\nThen cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.<br>\nBut John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?<br>\nAnd Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.<br>\nAnd Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:<br>\nAnd lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1951777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951777", "title": "Philotas", "text": "Philotas\n\nPhilotas (Greek: Φιλώτας, died October 330 BC) was the eldest son of Parmenion, one of Alexander the Great's most experienced and talented generals. He rose to command the Companion Cavalry, but was accused of conspiring against Alexander and executed.\n\nWhen Alexander became king of Macedonia (336 BC) with Parmenion's support, he and his relations were rewarded with offices and commissions. Philotas was promoted, from a commander of a cavalry squadron to commander of the Companions, the corps of Macedonian cavalry that also provided bodyguards and attendants to the King. In battle, Alexander rode with and led this cavalry corps; they were, literally, his \"companions,\" hence the name. Philotas, though a highly capable officer, was widely perceived as arrogant and pompous; he was never able to master the role of courtier, was often a center of conflict, and often earned the King's disfavour.\n\nIn the latter part of 330 BC, while with Alexander in the area of today's Afghanistan during the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, Philotas was accused of conspiring against Alexander. He had been subject to similar reports previously, though the case against him in 330 was more serious; his accusers included the commander Coenus, who was married to Philotas' sister. Philotas was tried and convicted, tortured to reveal the extent of the conspiracy, then stoned or speared to death with other convicted plotters. The execution of Philotas necessitated the removal of Parmenion, who, while innocent of any plotting, was judged unreliable once his son and heir had been put to death. Alexander sent assassins to kill Parmenion before the news of his son's execution reached him.\n\nThe story of Philotas was dramatized in 1604 by the English poet and playwright Samuel Daniel. A performance of the eponymously named play earned Daniel the unwelcome scrutiny of the Privy Council, because of a perceived resemblance between the play's protagonist and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, executed for rebellion and treason in 1601.\n\nIn the film \"Alexander\" (2004), Philotas is played by Joseph Morgan, and in the film \"Alexander the Great\" (1956), Philotas is played by Rubén Rojo.\n\nThe German dramatist and critic Gotthold Ephraim Lessing also adapted the story; his play \"Philotas\" dates to 1759. It was written during the Enlightenment and when Prussia was a major player in Germany.\n\nThe drama was also written during the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) between Prussia and Hannover, against France, Austria, Switzerland, and Spain for control over regions such as Silesia and Saxony.\n\nThe play tells the story of prince-commander Philotas, a young and impulsive heir, who is made prisoner during his first battle. While captive, Philotas is visited by King Arideus, a former friend of his father. While in warm dialogue with Philotas, Arideus tells him that his own son has also been made captive by the other side, and that both kings are planning an exchange of prisoners.\n\nSoon afterwards, Philotas is seen by Parmenio, his father's messenger, who asks him about when the exchange of prisoners will take place. Philotas pleas with Parmenio for more time, and requests an extra day prior to the exchange.\n\nPhilotas then begins a heavy monologue, filled with moral and ethical questions, about whether remaining alive would better serve his father's interests, especially considering that he is in possession of Arideus' son.\n\nPhilotas concludes that the most appropriate thing to do is to kill himself, to preserve his father's dominion over the lands in dispute. He then manages to obtain a sword from Arideus, claiming it would 'fit him better' before meeting the squadron, something Arideus has asked him to do.\n\nThe legitimacy of Philotas' suicide is a subject of discussion in modern theatre and ethics education. A common question is whether Philotas' suicide was necessary, and whether Lessing desired to praise, or else criticise, the strong moral codes that dominated Prussia during the 18th century, which according to many scholars were key to the survival of the Prussian empire.\n\nAmong the values exalted by the Prussian morale were: prudence, modesty, hard work, honesty, fairness, courage, strictness with oneself, order, duty, punctuality, integrity, austerity, loyalty, and subordination to power.\n\n"}

Hushpuppies are frequently served as a side dish with seafood and other deep-fried foods.\n\nThe use of ground corn (maize) in cooking originated with Native Americans, who first cultivated the crop. Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole cooking introduced one of its main staples into Southern cuisine: corn, either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make hominy, in a Native American technology known as nixtamalization. Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was inexpensive and could be made in many different shapes and sizes. It could be fashioned into high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried for a quick meal.To a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Southeastern Indians live on today is the \"soul food\" eaten by both black and white Southerners. ... Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as \"corn meal dumplings\", ... and as \"hush puppies\"...\n\nHushpuppies are strongly associated with the Southern United States. A southern hushpuppy championship is held annually in Lufkin, Texas, and they are also available throughout the United States at restaurants serving deep-fried seafood.\n\nThe first recorded use of the word \"hush-puppy\" dates to 1899. The name is often attributed to hunters, fishermen, or other cooks who would fry some basic cornmeal mixture (possibly that they had been bread-coating or battering their own food with) and feed it to their dogs to \"hush the puppies\" during cook-outs or fish-fries. Other legends date the term to the Civil War, in which Confederate soldiers are said to have tossed fried cornbread to quell the barks of their dogs.\n\nTypical hushpuppy ingredients include cornmeal, wheat flour, eggs, salt, baking soda, milk or buttermilk, and water, and may include onion, spring onion (scallion), garlic, whole kernel corn, and peppers. Sometimes pancake batter is used. The batter is mixed well, adjusting ingredients until thick, and dropped a spoonful at a time into hot oil. The small breads are fried until crispy golden brown, and cooled. Hushpuppies are served with seafood or barbecued foods. They are commonly made at home or served in restaurants advertising home-style food.\n\nIn Jamaica, such fried bread dumplings are known as \"festivals\", and are made from a flour and cornmeal dough, with added salt and sugar, which is then formed into hot-dog roll shapes and deep-fried. They are sweeter than hushpuppies, which often contain onion or garlic. They are served with jerked meats such as pork or chicken. Mostly, it is served with fried or escoveitch (see also escabeche and ceviche) fish. \n\nIn Puerto Rico, hushpuppies are made in the shape of a short sausage and are called \"sorullos\" or \"sorullitos\" and stuffed with cheese.\n\n"}

The organizations must promote their commodity in a generic way, without reference to a particular producer. Checkoff programs attempt to improve the market position of the covered commodity by expanding markets, increasing demand, and developing new uses and markets. Checkoff programs amount to $750 million per year.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture is responsible for overseeing the formation of checkoff organizations under the authority of the Commodity, Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1996.\n\nThese organizations are responsible for familiar American advertising campaigns, including \"Milk Does a Body Good,\" the Got Milk? milk moustache series, \"Pork. The Other White Meat\", \"The Incredible, Edible Egg\", and \".\"\n\nBecause individual producers of nearly homogeneous agricultural commodities cannot easily convince consumers to choose one egg or orange or a single cut of beef over another, they often have joined together in commodity promotion programs to use generic advertising in an effort to expand total demand for the commodity, with the objective of helping their own sales as well. Activities are intended to expand both domestic and export demand; examples include advertising, nutrition education, research to improve product quality and appeal, market research studies, and technical assistance. These activities are often self-funded through assessments on marketing – hence, the name check-off programs.\n\nCongress has permitted producer groups to make checkoffs mandatory, and this aspect has generated legal challenges by some producers, who contend they must pay taxes for activities they would not underwrite voluntarily. The U.S. Supreme Court [in United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 412 (2001)] ruled that the mushroom check-off violated the Constitutional free speech provisions (First Amendment), creating uncertainty about the future of other check-offs. Since then, separate lower federal courts have ruled that various check-offs also are unconstitutional. However, on May 23, 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the beef check-off does not violate the First Amendment. In its decision, Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association and Nebraska Cattlemen v. Livestock Marketing Association (Nos. 03-1164 and 03-1165), a majority of the Court agreed with check-off defenders that the programs are in fact \"government speech\" (an issue that was not considered in the mushroom decision).\"Compelled funding of government speech does not alone raise First Amendment concerns,\"...\"Citizens may challenge compelled support of private speech, but have no First Amendment right not to fund government speech.\" A Montana federal court ruled in June 2017 that the operation of the beef checkoff there was unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2008, the American Egg Board attempted to funnel $3 million to oppose a ballot measure in California prohibiting the extreme confinement of farm animals. They were stopped by an injunction issued by a federal court. In 2013, the Egg Board attempted to get government regulators and retailers to take action to halt sales of egg-free vegan “Just Mayo” brand products. In this scandal, an Egg Board executive was caught discussing \"putting a hit on\" Hampton Creek co-founder Josh Tetrick.\n\nDespite $4 million spent to support the retention of the checkoff, a referendum held in 2000 among hog farmers voted to eliminate the checkoff. Ann Veneman, the Secretary of Agriculture, voided the results. \n\nThe Senate in 2017 is considering changes to the enabling legislation. The constitutionality of checkoffs is being challenged again in federal court in Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. Sonny Perdue. The propriety of labeling Canadian and Mexican beef as domestic (and therefore eligible for promotion under the checkoff program) is being challenged in Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. USDA.\n\nIn 2017, Congress is considering a checkoff program for Concrete Masonry Products.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951810", "title": "M8 Greyhound", "text": "M8 Greyhound\n\nThe M8 Light Armored Car is a 6×6 armored car produced by the Ford Motor Company during World War II. It was used from 1943 by the United States and British troops in Europe and the Far East until the end of the war. The vehicle was widely exported and still remained in service with some countries.\n\nIn British service, the M8 was known as the \"Greyhound\", a nickname seldom if ever used by the US. The British Army found it too lightly armored, particularly the hull floor, which anti-tank mines could easily penetrate (the crews' solution was lining the floor of the crew compartment with sandbags). Nevertheless, it was produced in large numbers. The M8 Greyhound's excellent on-road mobility made it a great supportive element in the advancing American and British armored columns. It was marginal off-road, especially in mud.\n\nIn July 1941, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department initiated the development of a new fast tank destroyer to replace the M6 37 mm gun motor carriage, which was essentially a ¾-ton truck with a 37 mm gun installed in the rear bed. The requirement was for a 6×4 wheeled vehicle armed with a 37 mm gun, a coaxial machine gun mounted in a turret, and a machine gun in the front hull. Its glacis armor was supposed to withstand fire from a machine gun and side armor from a machine gun. Prototypes were submitted by Studebaker (designated T21), Ford (T22) and Chrysler (T23), all of them quite similar in design and appearance.\n\nIn April 1942, the T22 was selected, despite complaints about deficiencies, due to the need for vehicles. By then, it was clear that the 37 mm gun would not be effective against the front armor of German tanks; so, the new armored car, now designated the M8, took on a reconnaissance role instead. Contract issues and minor design improvements delayed serial production until March 1943. Production ended in June 1945. A total of 8,523 M8 and 3,791 M20 armored cars were built, The M8 and M20 were manufactured at Ford Motor Company plants in Chicago, Illinois and Saint Paul, Minnesota; the St. Paul plant built 6,397 M8s to Chicago's 2,126; the 3,791 M20s were produced at the Chicago plant only.\n\nIn May 1942, having viewed the prototype, the British Tank Mission turned down the offer to acquire the M8 through Lend-Lease. It was named \"Greyhound\" in keeping with other U.S. armored cars already ordered by the British, such as the (cancelled) T18 Boarhound, the T17 Deerhound, the T17E1 Staghound and the (also cancelled) M38 Wolfhound.\n\nThe cavalry reconnaissance troops (equivalent to companies and assigned to infantry divisions) and squadrons (equivalent to battalions and assigned to armored divisions or independent and used at the direction of a division or corps commander) used by the US Army served as advance \"eyes and ears.\" This mission demanded an emphasis on speed and agility, rather than firepower and armor. When on the march, the cavalry's mission was to make contact with enemy forces at the earliest practical moment and maintain it thereafter. In this role, the recon troops identified hostile units and reported their strength, composition, disposition and movement. During withdrawals, the cavalry often served as a screening force for the main units.\n\nThe M8 performed this function with distinction. Each M8 armored car was equipped with a long-range radio set to assist in the exercise of command, or for the purpose of relaying information received from subordinate elements to higher headquarters. Another short-range radio set served to communicate within a cavalry reconnaissance platoon, reconnaissance team, or with headquarters. The M8 weighed fully loaded with equipment and crew, and was capable of cruising cross country or on highways without refueling. On normal roads, it was capable of a sustained speed of , hence its nickname.\n\nThe M8 was not designed for offensive combat, and its firepower was adequate only against similar lightly armored enemy vehicles and infantry. The vehicle's armor provided a fair degree of protection against small-arms fire but nothing more. With a meager of floor armor, the M8 was particularly vulnerable to German mines.\n\nThe vehicle's other drawback was limited mobility in heavily wooded areas and on broken terrain; armored cavalry units preferred using the ¼-ton reconnaissance car (Jeep) in these environments. A large turning radius, limited wheel travel, and open differentials limited its cross-country mobility and made the M8 susceptible to immobilization off-road in off-camber terrain and defiles. This led operators to using the vehicle mostly on existing roads and paths, where it became vulnerable to ambush. The use of wheels, rather than continuous tracks like a tank, gave it a higher ground pressure which hampered its off-road performance in soft or loose terrain such as mud and snow. Conversely, the performance of the M8 on hard surfaces was exceptional, with the vehicle having a long range and able to consistently maintain its top speed of 55 mph. Also, as a wheeled vehicle, the M8 was generally more reliable than tracked vehicles of similar size, requiring far less maintenance and logistics support.\n\nThe M8's armor was thin, but it provided protection for the crew from small-arms fire and shrapnel, enough so that the vehicle could carry out its main mission of reconnaissance. The frontal, sloped hull armor varied in thickness from 0.5 inches to 0.75 inches (15.8 to 19 mm) The side and rear hull armor, also sloped but slightly less so than the front, was 0.375 inches (9.5 mm) thick. The top armor was 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) thick, as was the floor. The turret was comparatively better protected than the hull, being 0.75 inches (19 mm) thick all around, with an 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) partial roof. The cast, rounded gun shield was uniformly 1 inch (25.4 mm) thick.\n\nThe M8 was fitted with a 37 mm M6 gun (aimed by an M70D telescopic sight) and a coaxially mounted Browning machine gun in a one-piece, cast mantlet, mounted in an open-topped, welded turret. The M8 was initially fitted without any kind of anti-aircraft defense; as a stopgap solution, a .50 caliber Browning M2HB machine gun on a ring mount was retrofitted to nearly all vehicles already in service. A purposefully-designed pintle was mounted on all late-production vehicles, but it saw comparatively little action due to a troubled development process.\n\nThe crew of four comprised a commander (who doubled as the loader), gunner, driver, and radio operator (who could also act as a driver). The driver and radio operator were seated in the forward section of the hull, while the commander and gunner sat in the turret, with the commander seated on the right, and the gunner on the left,\n\nThe vehicle carried 80 37 mm rounds (16 in the turret and 64 in an ammunition rack in the right sponson) when fitted with a single radio. Vehicles with a second radio installed only carried 16 main gun rounds. Some units solved this problem by cutting up the removed main ammunition rack and stowing 18 rounds in each sponson, under the radios. This raised the number of main gun rounds able to be carried to 52. Another modification (the most common one) involved fabricating (again from the discarded main ammunition rack) a 43-round bin to be placed behind the driver's seat, and a 20-round bin attached to the framing of the turret basket. This raised the ammunition capacity up to 79 rounds. Machine gun ammunition consisted of 1,500 .30 caliber rounds and 400 .50 caliber rounds. In addition, the vehicle carried a mix of 16 smoke and hand grenades, four smoke pots, six M1 anti-tank mines and four M1 carbines for the crew.\n\nThe M8 was powered by a Hercules Model JXD in-line six-cylinder 320 in³ gasoline engine giving it a top speed of 55 mph (88 km/h) on-road, and off-road. With a 59 U.S. gallon (210 litre) fuel tank and an average fuel consumption of 7.5 mpg, it could manage an average road range of 200–400 miles (320–640 km) The Hercules JXD ran more quietly than other engines of comparable power, which helped the M8 maintain an element of surprise and reduce the chance of being heard by the enemy. Because of this, the M8 armored cars in Patton's Third Army were known as \"Patton's ghosts\", since they were almost never detected by the Germans until it was too late.\n\nThe M8 light armored car, the \"Greyhound\", entered combat service with the Allies in 1943. It was purpose designed to serve as the primary basic command and communication combat vehicle of the U.S. Cavalry Reconnaissance Troops.\n\nThe M8 first saw action in Sicily in 1943 and was subsequently used by the U.S. Army in Italy, Europe, and the Pacific. In the latter theater, it was used mostly on Okinawa and the Philippines, and was even employed in its original tank destroyer role as most Japanese tanks had armor that was vulnerable to its 37 mm gun.\n\nOver 1,000 were supplied via lend-lease channels to US allies; United Kingdom, Free France and Brazil.\nThe vehicle was considered fast, sufficiently reliable (after some technical problems were solved) and armed and armored well enough for reconnaissance missions. However, cavalry units criticized its off-road performance, which was even worse than the M3A1 scout car it replaced. In the mountainous terrain of Italy and in the deep mud and snow of North European winter, the M8 was more or less restricted to roads, which greatly reduced its value as a reconnaissance vehicle. It was also very vulnerable to landmines. An add-on armor kit was designed to provide an extra quarter-inch of belly armor to reduce landmine vulnerability. Some crews placed sandbags on the floor to make up for the thin belly armor.\n\nAnother problem was that commanders often used their reconnaissance squadrons for fire support missions, for which the thinly-armored M8 was ill-suited. When it encountered German armored reconnaissance units, the M8 could easily penetrate their armor with its 37 mm gun. Conversely, its own thin armor was vulnerable to the 20 mm autocannons that German scout cars were equipped with.\n\nThere is an urban myth that during the Battle of St. Vith in the Battle of the Bulge, an M8 of Troop B, 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron was able to destroy a German King Tiger heavy tank after getting in behind one on the Schonberg Road. According to the myth, the commander tried to traverse his turret to engage the M8. The M8 fired three 37 mm rounds through the 80 mm thick rear armor of the Tiger from only , setting it on fire. According to Antony Beevor: \"There was a muffled explosion, followed by flames which billowed out of the turret and engine port.\" . Under ideal conditions, a 37mm M6 gun could only penetrate 61mm of armour and had no hope of getting through the 80mm thick rear armour of a Tiger tank. Hunnicutt, R. P. (1988). Firepower: A History of the American Heavy Tank. Presidio Press. . It is also unlikely that a single German tank would be operating alone without infantry support.\n\nDue to mobility problems with the M8, namely with regards to its suspension, the US Army's Special Armored Vehicle Board recommended the development of a new six-wheeled armored car which matched the M8's dimensions and size but was equipped with articulated, independently sprung suspension system. Two prototypes, the Studebaker T27 and Chevrolet T28 were trialled by the US and also reviewed by the British Armed Forces. The new armored car program was shelved and then permanently cancelled due to the end of the war, as impetus and funding for new military development projects had plummeted. The fleet of preexisting M8 and M20 armored cars was then considered more than adequate for the postwar US Army, which was demobilizing thousands of personnel and already had large stockpiles of equipment surplus to its requirements.\n\nAfter the war, many of the US Army's M8 and M20 armored cars were marked off as surplus and donated or sold to various countries, especially under the Foreign Military Assistance Program (MAP). Most of the remaining vehicles remained in service with the United States Constabulary in various Western European nations. M8s were also used by American occupation forces in Korea, which later donated them to the fledgling Republic of Korea Army's first armored cavalry regiment. \n\nMost M8s and M20s remaining in US service had been allocated to one of five reorganized armored cavalry regiments by the early 1950s. The others were utilized by the Military Police Corps, which deployed them during the Korean War for guarding static installations and escorting prisoners. A small number of M20s were modified by US or South Korean forces as assault vehicles equipped with ring-mounted flamethrowers during that conflict. All the US Army M8s and M20s were retired from active duty due to age and increasing obsolescence shortly after the Korean War. The majority of decommissioned vehicles were then shipped abroad as aid to various armies, especially the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, save for a small number which were retained by Army National Guard units. When the Army National Guard retired its own armored cars a few years later, an undisclosed number were purchased by domestic police departments and modified for riot control purposes.\n\nFrance was the largest postwar operator of the M8/M20 series after the United States, having received hundreds of the vehicles as American aid between 1945 and 1954. During the First Indochina War, many second-hand examples were shipped directly from the US to French Indochina, where they were deployed for rural patrols and road reconnaissance. These remained in service in Indochina until the end of the war, when they were donated to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The French Foreign Legion also utilized the M8 during the Algerian War, where it was superseded first by the Panhard EBR and subsequently by the Panhard AML in counter-insurgency operations. The EBR was accepted as a generic replacement for all remaining M8s by the French military in 1956. Between 1956 and 1964 the remaining M8s and M20s were donated to the Mobile Gendarmerie, as well as the armies of several former French colonies. \n\nARVN M8s and M20s saw considerable action during the Vietnam War; however, by 1962 the US noted the attrition rate of the fleet was becoming high due to age. This resulted in a proposal to fund the design and production of a new purpose built armored car for the South Vietnamese government: the Cadillac Gage Commando. The Commando series began to replace the M8 and M20 in ARVN service from the mid-1960s onward. A small number of the older armored cars were still held by the ARVN reserves as late as 1975; these were inherited by the People's Army of Vietnam after the war.\n\nAnother country which received a substantial number of ex-American M8s following the war was Belgium, which presumably received them as part of a NATO military assistance program. These M8s were adopted primarily by the Belgian Air Component, which issued them to base security units, and the Force Publique in the Belgian Congo. Following Congolese independence several of the Force Publique M8s fell into the hands of Katangese separatists, while others were repurposed for peacekeeping operations by the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC).\n\nThe continued proliferation of M8s and M20s during the late 1960s and 1970s resulted in American and French defense contractors offering several commercial upgrade kits to extend their service life. At least ten countries, Cameroon, Cyprus, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Morocco, Venezuela, and Zaire, modernized their M8/M20 fleets with diesel engines and new transmissions during this time. The National Army of Colombia also invested heavily in upgrading the M8's turret armament, having it replaced by a single .50 caliber machine gun and a launcher for BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles. In the late 1960s Brazil developed an upgraded M8 with an articulated suspension, new gearbox, and new engine built with parts that could be sourced locally. This project spawned a series of indigenous prototypes, including a bizarre four-wheeled variant of the M8 chassis known as the \"VBB\", and another more conventional six-wheeled design known as the \"VBR-2\". The latter subsequently evolved into the first Brazilian manufactured armored car, the EE-9 Cascavel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Originally released by Alfa Records in Japan in 1978, the album was released by A&M Records in Europe and the United States and Canada in early 1979, with the US version featuring new cover art but without the closing track of \"Acrobat\". Both versions would later be re-issued in 2003 as a double-disc format, with the American version as the first disc.\n\nThe album was an early example of synth-pop, a genre that the band helped pioneer. It contributed to the development of electro, hip hop, techno, and bleep techno. The album's innovations in electronic music included its use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer music sequencer which allowed the creation of new electronic sounds, and its sampling of video game sounds.\n\nThe album sold 250,000 copies in Japan and entered the \"Billboard\" 200 and R&B Albums charts in the United States. Its most successful single was \"Computer Game / Firecracker\", which sold over 400,000 records in the United States and was a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe album was intended to be a one-off project for producer and bass player Haruomi Hosono and the two session musicians he had hired: drummer Yukihiro Takahashi and keyboard player Ryuichi Sakamoto. The trio were to create their own cover version of Martin Denny's 1959 exotica melody \"Firecracker\" with modern electronics, as a subversion of the exoticisation and Orientalism of the original tune, along with various original compositions also exploring themes of Asianness, exoticisation and Orientalism from a Japanese perspective. The album would eventually be called \"Yellow Magic Orchestra\", as a satire of Japan's obsession with black magic at the time. The project proved highly popular, culminating in a career for the three musicians; one that would last until 1983, before successful solo careers and reunions over the decades to come.\n\nThey began recording the album in July 1978 at a Shibaura studio in Tokyo. It utilized a wide variety of electronic music equipment (as well as electric), including the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, the Korg PS-3100 polyphonic synthesizer, the Korg VC-10 vocoder, the Yamaha Drums and Syn-Drums electronic drum kits, the Moog III-C and Minimoog monosynths, the Polymoog and ARP Odyssey analog synthesizers, the Oberheim Eight-Voice synthesizer, the Fender Rhodes electric piano, and the Fender Jazz Bass. Besides the electronic equipment, the only acoustic instruments used in the album were a Steinway piano, drum set, and a marimba.\n\nIt was the earliest known popular music album to use the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which was programmed by Hideki Matsutake during recording sessions. The swingy funk element present throughout the album was expressed by Matsutake programming through subtle variations of the MC-8's input. At the time, \"Billboard\" noted that the use of such computer-based technology in conjunction with synthesizers allowed Yellow Magic Orchestra to create new sounds that were not possible until then. The band later described both the MC-8 and Matsutake as an \"inevitable factor\" in both their music production and live performances.\n\nThe album was an early example of synth-pop, a genre that Yellow Magic Orchestra helped pioneer. \"Yellow Magic Orchestra\" experiments with different styles of electronic music, such as Asian melodies played over synthpop backings in \"Firecracker\" and \"Cosmic Surfin'\", the extensive use of video game sounds in \"Computer Game\", and the electronic disco bass in \"Tong Poo\", a song that was inspired by Chinese music produced during the China's Cultural Revolution, and in turn influenced video game music such as \"Tetris\". Both \"Computer Game\" tracks proper contain the same audio and were made to sound as if both games were being played in the same room; each track being from the perspective of its titular arcade game unit: \"Circus\" and \"Space Invaders\". The song also samples the opening chiptune used in the arcade game \"Gun Fight\" (1975). Both \"Circus\" and \"Space Invaders\", along with several other popular arcade video games, were also featured in the promotional film for \"Tong Poo\".\n\nThe album was first released in Japan in 1978. It was released in the US on 30 May 1979 by A&M Records on the Horizon label with a new mix by Al Schmitt, new cover art and a slightly different track listing. This \"US version\" was subsequently released in Japan on 25 July 1979 by Alfa. Promotional A&M copies were pressed on yellow vinyl.\n\n\"Firecracker\" was released as a single under the name \"Computer Game\". As such, on early US pressings of the album, \"Computer Game 'Theme from \"The Circus\"'\" and \"Firecracker\" were combined as one track, while the firecracker sound effect at the end of the track was indexed by itself as \"Firecracker\". This was corrected on later pressings. US pressings also featured a more American-friendly mixing (highlighting a punchier equalization and heavy use of reverb). Several of the segues on the second side of the album were edited differently, while \"Bridge over Troubled Music\" was given an additional electric piano solo over top of the introductory percussion.\n\nYellow Magic Orchestra – arrangements, electronics\n\nGuest musicians\n\nStaff\n\nUS version alternative staff\n\nThe song \"Firecracker\" was released as a single in Japan in 1978 and in the United States and United Kingdom in 1979, becoming a major R&B hit in the United States. The same year, the song was released as the \"Computer Game\" single, which combined the \"Computer Game\" and \"Firecracker\" tracks together. The \"Computer Game\" single was an even greater international success, selling over 400,000 copies in the United States and entering the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe song was popular with the emerging hip hop community, which appreciated the new electronic sounds, and in the Bronx, where it was later sampled by pioneering hip hop artist Afrika Bambaataa in his famous 1983 debut album \"Death Mix\" (1983). The \"terse videogame-funk\" sounds of \"Computer Game\" would have a strong influence on the emerging electro and hip hop music genres; the song's use of video game sounds and bleeps has been described as \"ahead of their time\" and as having a strong influence on 1980s hip hop and pop music. It was later included in electro hip hop artist Mantronix's compilation album \"That's My Beat\" (2002), which consists of electro music that influenced his early career.\n\nThe song was also an influence on early techno, specifically Detroit techno, for which it was included in Carl Craig's compilation album \"Kings of Techno\" (2006). The song also influenced Sheffield's bleep techno music; Warp's third record, \"Testone\" (1990) by Sweet Exorcist, defined Sheffield's techno sound, by making playful use of sampled sounds from \"Computer Game\" along with dialogues from the film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977). \"Testone\" was in turn sampled in the UK hit \"Tunes Splits The Atom\" (1990) by 808 State and MC Tunes, as well as in \"Naughty Naughty\" (1994) by Jus a Test.\n\n\"Computer Game / Firecracker\" was also sampled in a number of other songs, including Teddy Riley's hip hop single \"Wong\" (1986) by Al B. & Just Two MC's, 2 Live Crew's \"Mega-Mixx II\" (1987), De La Soul's \"Funky Towel\" (for the 1996 film \"Joe's Apartment\"), Jennifer Lopez's worldwide hit \"I'm Real\" (2001), and the original unreleased version of Mariah Carey's \"Loverboy\" (for the 2001 film soundtrack \"Glitter\").\n\nThe anime series \"Cowboy Bebop\" has a character named Mad Pierrot, and Mad Pierrot's other alias is \"Tongpu\".\n"}

Coetzer turned professional in 1988 and retired in 2004. She won her first top-level singles title in 1993 in Melbourne, and her second later that year in Tokyo.\n\nCoetzer entered the top twenty on the women's world rankings in 1992 and remained there for most of the next ten years. She earned a reputation for regularly beating players who were ranked higher than her, and reached the peak of her career in 1997. By virtue of scoring so many upset wins in spite of her five-foot-two stature, she gained her nickname: \"The Little Assassin.\"\n\nCoetzer is the daughter of Nico and Suska Coetzer. She started playing tennis at the age of 6. During her playing career she resided primarily in Hilton Head, South Carolina and was coached by Gavin Hopper. She is married to the Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan.\n\nAt the Canadian Open in 1995, Coetzer defeated three players ranked in the world's top 5 – Steffi Graf (No. 1), Jana Novotná (No. 4) and Mary Pierce (No. 5) – before finally losing to Monica Seles in the final. The defeat of Graf ended a 32-match winning-streak for the German.\n\nAt the Australian Open in 1996, Coetzer became the first South African woman in the Open era to reach a Grand Slam semifinal, where she lost in three sets to Anke Huber.\n\n1997 was the best season of Coetzer's career. In reaching the Australian Open semi-finals for the second consecutive year, she defeated World No. 1 Graf in the fourth round. She then beat Graf for a second time in the quarter-finals at Berlin (it was her worst-ever loss: 6–0, 6–1 in just 56 minutes). And then, in the quarter-finals of the French Open, she defeated Graf yet again to become one of just six players to beat Graf three times in one year, and one of only four to defeat her more than once in Grand Slam matches. Coetzer lost in the French Open semi-finals to eventual-champion Iva Majoli. Later in the year in Leipzig, Coetzer beat Martina Hingis, who by then had taken over the World No. 1 ranking. Coetzer won two singles titles that year – in Budapest and Luxembourg.\n\nCoetzer won the biggest title of her career in 1998 at Hilton Head (Tier I event).\n\nIn 1999, Coetzer became the only player to defeat Steffi Graf, Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport while they were ranked No. 1.\n\nIn 2000, Coetzer teamed-up with Wayne Ferreira to win the Hopman Cup for South Africa. She also was a member of South Africa's Fed Cup team for six years and represented South Africa at the Olympic Games on three occasions.\n\nIn 2001, she qualified for her ninth consecutive year-end championship.\n\nIn 2002, she obtained an invite from the Hong Kong Tennis Patrons' Association to play The Hong Kong Ladies Challenge 2002.\n\nIn her career, Coetzer won nine top-level singles titles and nine doubles titles.

She was the daughter of Charles Edward Fraser Tytler of Balnain and Aldourie, who worked for the East India Company. She spent much of her youth in Scotland, where she was raised by her grandparents, and settled in England in the 1860s. Early in 1870 she studied art in Dresden before enrolling at the South Kensington School of Art later the same year. During 1872 and 1873 Tytler studied sculpture at the Slade School of Art. She initially became known as a portrait painter, and was associated with Julia Margaret Cameron and the Freshwater community. There she met painter George Frederic Watts, and at the age of 36 (he was 69), became his second wife on 20 November 1886 in Epsom, Surrey.\n\nWatts was President of the Godalming and District National Union of Women's Suffrage Society and she convened at least one women's suffrage meeting in Compton, Surrey.\n\nWatts died at her home, Limnerslease, in Compton on 6 September 1938. Her remains are buried in the Watts Chapel.\n\nAfter her marriage, Watts largely worked in the fields of Celtic and Art Nouveau bas-reliefs, pottery, metalwork, and textiles. She co-founded the Compton Potters' Arts Guild and the Arts & Crafts Guild in Compton, Surrey. She designed, built, and maintained the Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton (1895–1904); and had built and maintained the Watts Gallery (1903–04) for the preservation of her husband's work.\n\nWatts exhibited her work at The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nWatts, through the Home Arts and Industries Association (HAIA), worked to create employment for rural communities through the preservation of handicrafts. During the execution of the Watts Mortuary Chapel, Watts trained workers in clay modelling, an initiative that eventually led to the establishment of the Compton Potters' Guild in 1899. She was a firm believer in the idea that anyone given the opportunity could produce things of beauty and that everyone should have a craft within which they could express themselves creatively. She supported the revival of the Celtic style, the indigenous artistic expression of Scotland and Ireland. In 1899, she was asked to design rugs in this style for the carpet company Alexander Morton & Co of Darvel, Liberty's main producer of furnishing fabrics. In cooperation with the Congested Districts Board, Morton had established a workshop in Donegal, Ireland, to employ local women who had little opportunity to earn a livelihood.\n\nWatts pioneered Liberty's Celtic style, with much of the imagery for the Celtic Revival carpets, book-bindings, metalwork, and textiles for Liberty & Co. being based on her earlier designs at the Watts Mortuary Chapel.\n\nLater in life, Watts wrote \"The Word in the Pattern\" (1905), which details the use of symbols in the Watts Mortuary Chapel, and completed a three-volume biography of her husband, \"Annals of an Artist's Life\" (1912).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1951864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951864", "title": "Supreme Court of New South Wales", "text": "Supreme Court of New South Wales\n\nThe Supreme Court of New South Wales is the highest state court of the Australian State of New South Wales. It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters, and hears the most serious criminal matters. Whilst the Supreme Court is the highest New South Wales court in the Australian court hierarchy, an appeal by special leave can be made to the High Court of Australia.\n\nMatters of appeal can be submitted to the New South Wales Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal, both of which are constituted by members of the Supreme Court, in the case of the Court of Appeal from those who have been commissioned as judges of appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court consists of 52 permanent judges, including the Chief Justice of New South Wales, presently Tom Bathurst, the President of the Court of Appeal, 11 Judges of Appeal, the Chief Judge at Common Law, and the Chief Judge in Equity.\n\nThe Supreme Court building is physically located in Queen's Square, Sydney, New South Wales.\n\nThe first superior court of the Colony of New South Wales (known as the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature) was established by letters patent dated 2 April 1814, known as the \"Second Charter of Justice of New South Wales\". That charter provided that there should be a Supreme Court constituted by a Judge appointed by the King's commission and two Magistrates. The charter also created the Governor's Court and the Lieutenant-Governor's Court. The jurisdiction of the Governor's Court and the Supreme Court extended to Van Diemen's Land (the former name for Tasmania). All three courts were concerned with civil matters only.\n\nLegislation to establish a new supreme court for both New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land was prepared in London by James Stephen, counsel to the Colonial Office, and Francis Forbes, Chief Justice of Newfoundland and Chief Justice-designate of New South Wales. The act was called an \"Act to provide for the better administration of justice in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land and for the more effectual government thereof\" and is commonly numbered as \"4 Geo. IV, c. 96\". The statute was passed on 19 July 1823.\n\nIn consequence of this legislation, letters patent establishing the New South Wales Supreme Court were sealed on 13 October 1823, and proclaimed in Sydney on 17 May 1824. They are known as the Third Charter of Justice of New South Wales.\n\nThis charter provided that there should be a Chief Justice for the colony of New South Wales in the Island of New Holland (as the continent of Australia was then known), as well as other judges, a registrar, a prothonotary, a master, and a Keeper of Records and such other Officers as may be necessary for the administration of Justice in the colony.\n\nThe charter also established the office of sheriff; gave precedence to the Chief Justice over all other subjects except the Governor (or acting Governor) of the colony; and allowed the Court to admit persons to be barristers, attorneys, proctors or solicitors as the case may be. Previously, a person had to be admitted as such in the United Kingdom. However, ex-convicts were not permitted to be admitted.\n\nIn 1840, a Port Phillip division of the Court was created, consisting of a single Resident Judge, to exercise the court's jurisdiction in the Port Phillip District of the Colony of New South Wales. The division existed until 1852, when it was replaced by the Supreme Court of Victoria following the creation of the Colony of Victoria.\n\nAlso in 1840, the Parliament of New South Wales established a separate equity division in the court. Limited jurisdiction in divorce cases was granted in 1873 and full Admiralty jurisdiction was added in 1911. The Supreme Court, in 1972, was one of the last Common Law jurisdictions in the world to fuse the administration of Equity and Common Law, although these continue as the historic names for the two divisions of the court. This process began in the United Kingdom with the passage of the Judicature Acts in 1873. Since 1930, three generations of the Street family have served New South Wales as Chief Justice.\n\nSupreme Court Judges Carolyn Simpson, Margaret Beazley and Virginia Bell made headlines in April 1999 when the three sat in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sydney. The Judges threw out an appeal from a convicted computer hacker who had, out of \"sheer maliciousness\", been posting offensive messages on Ausnet's homepage. According to the Women Lawyers Association of NSW, there had never been an all-female bench in England or New Zealand at the time.\n\nThe court now operates under the , the , and the , although provisions on the appointment and removal of judicial officers were incorporated into the state's Constitution in 1992.\n\nThe court consists of 52 permanent judges, three Acting Judges of Appeal, two Acting Judges, and an Associate Judge. Permanent judges include the Chief Justice of New South Wales, the President of the Court of Appeal, eleven Judges of Appeal (one of whom is currently the Chief Judge at Common Law), the Chief Judge at Common Law and the Chief Judge in Equity, and 38 Puisne Judges.\n\nThe Chief Judge in each trial division also sits in the Court of Appeal from time to time. Occasionally, puisne judges also sit in the Court of Appeal, though this is uncommon.\n\nThe court hears very serious cases such as murder and treason, civil cases involving more than $750 000, and civil matters such as wills, injunctions, and admiralty. The court's work at first instance is divided between the Common Law Division, which hears civil, criminal and administrative law matters, and the Equity Division, which hears equity, probate, commercial, admiralty, and protective matters. The court includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal which hear appeals from the District Court and the Local Court and from single judges sitting in the Common Law or Equity Divisions. The Court of Appeal also hears appeals from the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales and a number of administrative tribunals.\n\nThe Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal are respectively the highest civil and criminal courts in the state. To appeal to the High Court of Australia from the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal, special leave must be granted by the High Court.\n\nAppeals from state supreme courts to the High Court are not limited to matters in which a federal question arises and the Constitution empowers the Federal Parliament to make laws vesting state courts with federal jurisdiction. The High Court of Australia can review decisions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to the common law and equitable jurisdictions of the court as well. The High Court of Australia has exercised this power on a number of occasions.\n\nThe Supreme Court of New South Wales was proclaimed in Sydney on 17 May 1824.\n\nThe inaugural Supreme Court building that is located on the corner of King Street and Elizabeth Street in the Sydney central business district, adjacent to what is now known as Queen's Square, was built between 1820 and 1828. The two-storey rectangular Georgian building, with an additional loggia and cornice added in 1868, was designed by Francis Greenway in 1819 under the direction of Governor Macquarie. This building is now called the Greenway Wing. Greenway was dismissed before the building was completed and its design was so modified by his successor, Standish Lawrence Harris, that the building barely resembles his original design. The building was occupied by the Supreme Court from 1827. In the 1860s James Barnet designed additions for the building including an arcaded loggia along the King Street façade and the new classical cornice and parapet for the roof, giving the structure a Victorian Italianate appearance. The building was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nGreenway was also responsible for designing the nearby Hyde Park Barracks, recorded on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and St James' Church, listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.\n\nThe second structure to house the Court is located immediately the southwest of the Greenway Wing on the corner of Elizabeth Street and St James Road. Designed by Government Architect Alexander Dawson, it is one of only two Government buildings which were designed in the Victorian Free Gothic style, the other being the nearby Land Titles Office. Built between 1859 and 1862 and listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999, the site is now known as the Old Registry Building. Barnet extended the Old Registry building in 1875 and 1886.\n\nDesigned by Walter Liberty Vernon and built between 1895 and 1896 in the Federation Free Classical style, the two-storey rich red brick Banco Road Court building was the third location of the Supreme Court. The Banco Wing is located to the east of the Old Registry building on St James Road and south of the Greenway Wing and makes little reference to the earlier buildings in either style or detailing. The interior of the courtroom has aesthetic significance and is said to be modelled on St Stephen's Court in Dublin. Despite its naming, the Court is located in St James' Road, opposite the north-western edge of Hyde Park. There is no Banco Road.\n\nIn 1976 the New South Wales Government completed construction of the Sydney Law Courts building, facing Queen's Square and bounded by Phillip Street and Macquarie Street. The 27-storey building is owned by Law Courts Limited, a company whose shareholders comprise the Government of Australia and the Government of New South Wales. The building houses the High Court of Australia (when it sits in Sydney), the Federal Court of Australia and the NSW Supreme Court. The building was designed by architects McConnel Smith and Johnson and received an RAIA Merit Award in 1977 and stands as a strong, singular statement representative of its time and a product of the brutalist school of architecture. Refurbished in 2009 at a cost of 214 million, a range of sustainability measures were implemented to extend the life and amenity of the building.\n\nThe current judges serving on the Court , and the dates of their appointment, are listed below.\n\n\n"}

It is usually situated above sufficiently deep water, or above mats, a box-spring mattress, piles of empty cardboard boxes, or other soft landing surfaces, or they may be used together with other means of dampening the impact (such as for example, platforms for bungee jumping). Children often improvise platforms, either on a large scale (at abandoned quarries) or on a smaller scale (e.g. by moving a desk next to a bed, to jump onto the bed from the desk).\n\nFor cliff jumping, the platform is usually a simple clearing in the bushes and other vegetation along the cliff above a river, ocean, lake, or quarry.\n\nSometimes railway bridges and other bridges are used as platforms. They can sometimes be distances up to approximately 30 metres (100 feet) above the water.\n\nAbandoned quarries, and deep ponds will often have platforms, whether by design, or by improvisation of the people in the community. For example, platforms will often be affixed to towers in abandoned rail yards, overlooking a deep pond.\n\nMany naturally occurring platforms are unofficial, and simply known among the children in a community. For example, the children are often trespassing on quarry land, or the like, when they use the platforms. Usually the locals check the water to make sure it is deep enough and free of clutter, but there is always the danger of a dead fish or beverage can, bottle, branches, or the like floating near the surface of the water. Bad angle of entry can also cause injury even in the absence of clutter (e.g. broken bones or re-arrangement of internal organs from the impact of the water itself, if landing crooked). Being knocked unconscious by the impact can also lead to drowning.\n\nFor cliff jumping, there are several techniques that can be utilized. The main technique involves landing in a pencil shape typically with hands at the sides or above the head. Keeping limbs in results in a freer and more painless entry. Pointed toes and closed mouth also assist in a smooth jump. Some prefer to jump with shoes or sandals, while others jump merely barefoot or naked.\n\nFor larger jumps ( +), the angle of entry is critical. To ensure that you always enter the water vertically, it is proper to jump leaning slightly forward, keeping your point of entry in view. Extend your arms for balance. As you fall, gradually tuck in your arms, and bring together your legs. A gradual backward rotation throughout the jump will bring you from your initial forward position to complete a vertical entry. Common errors include backward over rotation and not tucking in arms or legs. Keep legs straight with a slight bend at the knees. Locking your legs when taking the pencil shape will cause impact on the knees. Generally, the highest jump that should be attempted is .\n"}

A jury is used to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. The division also hears all civil matters involving amounts of more than 750,000. A jury may be used to decide these disputes.\n\nThe appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court allows its Court of Appeal to hear cases on appeal from the District Court, the trial division of the Supreme Court, and a number of other judicial tribunals in Queensland. Decisions made by the Supreme Court may be heard on appeal to the High Court of Australia in Canberra.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Queensland was founded on 7 August 1861, with the assent of the \"Supreme Court Constitution Amendment Act 1861\" (Qld). Two subsequent pieces of legislation, including the \"Additional Judge Act 1862\" (Qld) and the \"Supreme Court Act 1863\" (Qld), were also necessary to establish the court's operating system.\n\nPrior to separation of Queensland from New South Wales, the former naval officer, Captain John Clements Wickham, tried minor crimes in the Moreton Bay District. More serious cases were tried at the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Sydney. Two years before separation from New South Wales, the \"Moreton Bay Supreme Court Act 1857\" (NSW) established the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in the Moreton Bay District and Samuel Milford served as Judge. Milford resigned in February 1859, and was replaced by Alfred Lutwyche.Initially, the Brisbane Supreme Court served as the Supreme Court for all of Queensland. As the colony's population grew, two other courts were constructed. The first sittings of the Northern Supreme Court were held at Bowen in 1874 and the Bowen Court House was built in 1880 in classical revival style. The Central Supreme Court was officially opened at Rockhampton in 1896. After the opening of the Central Supreme Court at Rockhampton, the Northern Supreme Court moved from Bowen to Townsville. Justice Virgil Power, who served as the first Judge of the Central Supreme Court, was the first Queensland-born Supreme Court Judge. As the population of Queensland has grown, additional courts have been built at locations such as Bundaberg, Mackay, Cairns, Longreach, Maryborough, Roma and Townsville.\n\nAlthough the Brisbane Supreme Court initially served the needs of the entire colony of Queensland, it did not occupy a purpose-built building until 1879. Until then, the Brisbane Court sat at the Old Convict Barracks in Queen Street. These barracks were in disrepair and a number of improvements, including new sets of windows, had to be constructed to allow the continued sitting of the Court. Furthermore, on Sundays, the area of the barracks used by the Court was also used as a church. Although the Court's surroundings were not elaborate, Parliament did provide an annual grant towards the establishment of a Supreme Court Library from 1861 to 1879.\n\nBy 1870, despite minor building modifications to the convict barracks, it had become clear that a new building was required to house the Brisbane Supreme Court. A site on George Street was selected and the prominent colonial architect, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, submitted plans for an elaborate neoclassical building which was two storeys tall. These original plans featured stone floors and other sophisticated detail. They were later modified for financial reasons and in 1875 John Petrie successfully tendered to construct the building.\n\nOn 6 March 1879, the new Supreme Court opened. The entrance on the North Quay frontage had been designed as the main entrance but this was soon superseded by the George Street entrance. In 1880, iron gates were also added to the building. In 1931, the Queensland Public Works Department provided funds for the renovation of the interior of the Brisbane Supreme Court.\n\nOn the night of 2 September 1968, the building that housed the Brisbane Supreme Court was damaged by arson. It was subsequently demolished, and in 1976, it was replaced with a building designed by Bligh Jessup Bretnall and was opened by Queensland Governor Sir James Ramsay on 3 September 1981.\n\nIn 1989, Justice Angelo Vasta was removed from the court by Queensland Governor on the request of the Parliament. This was the first time since federation that any state had used that method to remove a sitting judge from a Supreme Court. Vasta was found to be not \"a fit and proper person to continue in office\" after giving false evidence to an investigation related to the Fitzgerald Inquiry.\n\nIn 2008, a 600 million building program began to create a new Brisbane Supreme Court and District Court building, designed by Architectus Brisbane, led by Prof John Hockings. The building is known as the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law and was officially opened on Friday 3 August 2012 by Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley incorporating a public plaza and links to the existing Brisbane Magistrates Court building. The precinct occupies an entire city block between George, Roma and Turbot streets.\n\nIn 1991 the Queensland Supreme Court was restructured into two divisions, the Trial Division and the Court of Appeal. The Court is headed by the Chief Justice of Queensland (currently Chief Justice Catherine Holmes) who sits in both the Trial Division and the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe Court of Appeal comprises the President (currently Justice Walter Sofronoff) and four Judges of Appeal, who sit only in the Court of Appeal. Proceedings in the Court of Appeal are usually heard by three judges. The Trial Division comprises a number of trial judges, and is headed by the Senior Judge Administrator (currently Justice Ann Lyons). Proceedings in the Trial Division are heard by one trial judge.

He was owned by John L. Greer and trained by LeRoy Jolley, who had previously been partners in the colt Ridan. He was sired by What A Pleasure, who won the Hopeful Stakes in 1967 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His dam, Fool-Me-Not, was descended from the British broodmare Becti (foaled 1929), who was the female-line ancestor of many major winners including Mrs McArdy, Borgia, and Boreal.\n\nFoolish Pleasure was undefeated as a two-year-old. In 1975, at age three, he won the Flamingo Stakes and Wood Memorial Stakes before contesting the Kentucky Derby. Ridden by Jacinto Vásquez, he raced well off the pace on the inside before making a forward move approaching the final turn. He was switched to the outside in the straight and produced a strong late burst to win from Avatar.\n\nAlthough heavily favored to win, Foolish Pleasure finished second to Master Derby in the Preakness. He then finished runner-up to Avatar in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nIn July 1975, a match race was arranged between Foolish Pleasure and the unbeaten filly Ruffian. Vásquez chose to ride Ruffian, with Braulio Baeza taking over on Foolish Pleasure. While on the lead, Ruffian broke down, allowing Foolish Pleasure to win unchallenged.\n\nFoolish Pleasure remained in training as a four-year-old and won the Donn Handicap and Suburban Handicap.\n\nFoolish Pleasure was placed at Greentree Stud after being syndicated for $4.5 million USD. He later spent time at Mint Lane Farm and Spendthrift Farm in Kentucky before being moved out to Kerr Stock Farm in California. He was purchased by Ron Vanderhoef in September 1993 and moved to Horseshoe Ranch in Dayton, Wyoming, where he remained until he died from a gastric rupture on November 17, 1994.\n\nFoolish Pleasure was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1995. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he was ranked #97.\n\n"}

It was written and produced by Max Martin and Rami. The song was released on January 22, 2002, by Jive Records, as the second single from \"Britney\". \"Overprotected\" is a dance-pop song that is about a girl who is tired of being overprotected and just wants to be herself. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. It was released to United States radio in a remixed R&B form by Darkchild on April 1, 2002.\n\nWhile it did not perform well on the \"Billboard\" charts in the United States, \"Overprotected\" peaked at number 22 in Canada, while reaching the top five in Italy, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video, directed by Billie Woodruff, portrays Spears dancing inside an abandoned factory while singing about being overprotected; the music video for \"The Darkchild Remix\", directed by Chris Applebaum, portrays Spears dancing and having fun with her friends. Spears has performed \"Overprotected\" a number of times including at the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001) and The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). In 2003, the song received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The song was also featured in the animated film \"Hotel Transylvania\" (2012).\n\nDuring the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears revealed she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled \"A Mother's Gift\". On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with \"Overprotected\" being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, \"Britney\", was released in November 2001. In an interview with the \"Daily Record\", Spears concluded she can relate to \"Overprotected\" \"on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. When I want to go out, everything has to be organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent.\"\n\n\"Oveprotected\" is a dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and 18 seconds. David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noticed Europop influences on the song, while other critics compared it to previous songs released by Spears. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, \"Overprotected\" is composed in the key of C minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans from A to C.\n\nLyrically, the track is about a girl who is tired of being manipulated by people around her and doesn't need to be told what to do, which is perceived in lines such as \"You're gonna have to see through my perspective/ I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am/ And I don't want to be so damn protected\". Dana Alice Heller, author of \"Makeover television: realities remodelled\" (2007), said that, with \"Overprotected\", \"Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others.\" She also compared \"Overprotected\" with the singer's first reality show, \"\" (2005), saying that \"Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence, a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand-ins.\"\n\nThe song's main release in North America was a reworked R&B remix by Rodney 'Darkchild' Jerkins. Jerkins said that the label \"needed a remix that's crazy\" and that the remix has \"an old-school-type rhythm, which I think is kinda cool because it's an element [that Spears] never had, but I still gave it her edge. I was up all night rocking that joint. [It has the] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track.\" \"The Darkchild Remix\" was originally scheduled for release to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002; this date was pushed back and the song was released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, stating \"[Britney] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna be one of the people that's gonna be around for a minute, because I see that in her.\"\n\nFinnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled \"JS16 Dub\" and \"JS16 Remix\". The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears' debut movie, \"Crossroads\" (2002).\n\nUpon release, the track received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jocelyn Vena of MTV said that \"with songs like \"Overprotected\" and \"Let Me Be,\" Spears seemed to be letting out her adolescent angst,\" while Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom said, \"the real first blush with emancipation from [the singer] teen pop past came with ['Overprotected']\". While reviewing Spears' third studio album \"Britney\" (2001), Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the track, along with \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" and \"What It's Like to Be Me\", \"are pivotal moments on Britney Spears' third album, the record where she strives to deepen her persona (not the same thing as her character, of course), making it more adult while still recognizably Britney\". Christopher Rosa, from \"Glamour\", deemed it Spears' eight best song, and said that \"feeling overly controlled or scrutinized is a consistent theme in Spears's discography, but this motif started with Overprotected\", calling the song \"introspection with a killer hook.\n\nCritic Robert Christgau also considered \"Overprotected\" and \"Cinderella\" as the highlights of \"Britney\", while saying, \"hardly the first not-terribly-bright teenager to approach self-knowledge via the words of others\". Nikki Tranker of PopMatters said the song \"is an absolute belter reminiscent of Britney’s previous big-bang singles, 'Oops! I Did It Again' and 'You Drive Me Crazy' [\"sic\"]\", while commenting that Spears \"sings about ridding herself of the girlie chains around her, gripes about her need for space in the whirlwind that is her life, and lets us know she don’t need nobody telling her what to do\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed it at number 24 on their ranking of Spears's songs and said that \"there’s an eerie amount of foreshadowing for what was to come in her personal life. And Max Martin shows once again he had an unassailable gift for crafting that decade’s most indelible hooks\". In 2003, the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj hailed it \"an anthem that deals with the complexities of growing up and being held back by other people's perceptions [...] full of distinctive chord progressions and more hooks than it seems possible to include in one song\".\n\n\"Overprotected\" attained commercial success in Europe. In France, it peaked at number 15, and was later certified Silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), for selling over 125,000 units of the single. In Sweden, the song reached number two, and was later certified Gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), for selling over 15,000 units.\n\n\"Overprotected\" reached number one in Mexico and was the best-selling single of 2002 in that country, also reached the top five in Italy, Romania, and United Kingdom, while reaching the top ten in Belgium (Flanders), Finland, Ireland, and Norway. In the United States, on the week of May 4, 2002, \"The Darkchild Remix\" peaked at number 86 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100, where it stayed on the chart for five weeks. It also entered on the Pop Songs chart, where it peaked at number 37 on the week of May 25, 2002, before dropping the chart in the following chart issue. In Canada, the song peaked at number 22 on the Canadian Hot 100.\n\nThe music video for \"Overprotected\" was directed by Billie Woodruff and produced under Geneva Films, while choreographed by Brian Friedman. In an interview with \"Harper's Bazaar\" in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, \"I just think it says a lot. It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing\". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with a part of the instrumental version of the song \"Bombastic Love\", featured on the album \"Britney\", playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance her way around the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside. They find Britney dancing around and joke about it, before heading into a heavy dance routine. Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls move in and out before the video ends, signifying that she is \"overprotected\". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building. The music video was the number one video of MTV’s Mexico in the final countdown of 2002 “Los 100 más pedidos” \n\nThe music video for \"The Darkchild Remix\" was directed by Chris Applebaum and filmed in the first weekend of March 2002 in Los Angeles, California. It was produced under A Band Apart Productions, while the choreography for this version was also created by Brian Friedman. The full shooting took 23 hours, and Applebaum was said to be impressed with Spears' \"stamina and patience through the marathon shoot, which wrapped 5 a.m.\" According to Joe D'Angelo of MTV News, \"the clip furthers her 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman' crusade to shirk her adolescent image, as she and five friends outsmart her bodyguard with the old 'you're wanted elsewhere' trick and sneak out of a hotel and into an underground dance club.\" It was released on March 26, 2002.\n\nSpears directly referenced Janet Jackson's \"Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)\" in the scenes on the elevator and when her and her dancers walk down the hotel lobby. Both videos also use the same hotel setting, filmed at Los Angeles' Millennium Biltmore Hotel. \n\nThe video opens with Spears and her friends in a hotel room, where a tabloid reporter on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she is often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes a phone call to her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they are caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine in the middle of the rain. As they make their entrance, they are dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.\n\n\"Overprotected\" was performed for the first time on 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour. During the performance, Spears was dancing to the song surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her hair growing as the song went along. However, the backdrop was later removed for unknown reasons. After the announcement of the 2002 extension of the tour, some changes were made to the setlist, replacing the original mix of the song by \"The Darkchild Remix\". The remix was later performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), during the opening act, right after the performance of \"Toxic\" (2003). Spears' debut film, \"Crossroads\" (2002), features a performance of the song during the credits.\n\n\"Overprotected\" was used in Japanese commercials for \"\". Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" also released 5 promotional prize \"Otogi X Britney\" DVDs containing two Britney Spears music videos, a demo of \"Otogi\", the Japanese commercials, and audio tracks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits for \"Overprotected\" are adapted from \"Britney\" liner notes.\n\nTechnical\n\nPersonnel\n\n"}

District Factor Groups organize districts statewide, ostensibly to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J. However, because socioeconomic data is derived from the municipality as a whole and a significant proportion of Teaneck's more affluent families send their children to parochial or other private schools, the usefulness of District Factor Grouping in the Teaneck district's case is disputed.\n\nThe Teaneck Public Schools have been recognized by the New Jersey Department of Education as part of its Best practices program. The district was awarded in the 1997-98 school year for its Passport Portfolio Program, and in the 2000-01 school year for its Early Literacy Initiative.\n\nHarvey B. Scribner, who later served as New York City School Chancellor, was hired in 1961 by the Teaneck Public Schools to serve as superintendent of the district. There he oversaw the adoption of mandatory busing in 1965 in which Teaneck voluntarily integrated its public schools. Despite angry phone calls from some parents and the occasional death threat, Teaneck's integration went smoothly and Scribner recalled that he was \"literally crying\" on the first day of school in 1965 when buses rolled into school without incident. Teaneck's 1965 busing plan was widely reported as the first district in the nation with a white majority to implement a voluntary school integration program.\n\nA 1982 teachers strike that lasted for 19 days was settled after a judge threatened to jail striking teachers and pressured the board of education to negotiate an agreement.\n\nSchools in the district (with 2017-18 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics)) include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaneck has received attention in the media due to sexual crimes committed against minors by faculty members.

He graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in suburban Maryland. Duffey learned to play the mandolin, dobro, and guitar, in addition to his tenor singing voice. He founded two of the most influential groups in bluegrass, The Country Gentlemen and The Seldom Scene. His tastes and sources were eclectic, often raiding folk song books and Protestant hymnals for material. He embraced the music of Bob Dylan and his style of playing was rock and jazz-inflected. In the late 1950s and the 1960s, he also increasingly began working as a session musician to supplement his income.\n\nThe son of a singer at the Metropolitan Opera, Duffey's singing ranged from tenor to falsetto, and was in contrast to the voice of baritone singer Charlie Waller.\n\nDuffey started playing guitar at age 17 after a neighbor convinced him to pick up the instrument. In 1957 he worked at radio station WFMD in Frederick, Maryland partnered with Charlie Waller to fill in for other musicians. That duo eventually became the Country Gentlemen. As a member of the Country Gentlemen, Duffey was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1996.\n\nAppearing with fellow Seldom Scene member, dobro player and baritone vocalist Mike Auldridge, Duffey played mandolin and provided tenor vocals for two tracks on the Tony Rice album \"Tony Rice Plays and Sings Bluegrass\".\n\nTwo months after his induction to the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor, Duffey was hospitalized in Arlington, Virginia after complaining of chest pains.

It is among the best known ichthyosaur genera, as it is the type genus of the order Ichthyosauria.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurus\" was smaller than most of its relatives, with individuals measuring up to in length. Hundreds of well-preserved, fossilised skeletons have been found in Jurassic rock at Holzmaden, Germany. Some of the bones were still articulated. Some fossils still had baby specimens inside them, indicating that \"Ichthyosaurus\" was viviparous. Similar finds in the related \"Stenopterygius\" also show this. The German fossils also featured the outline of \"Ichthyosaurus\"'s skin, revealing that it had a fleshy dorsal fin on its back and a large caudal fin. Other ichthyosaur fossils showed this feature was not limited to \"Ichthyosaurus\".\n\n\"Ichthyosaurus\" was the first complete fossil to be discovered in the early 19th century by Mary Anning in England.\n\n\"I. anningae\", described in 2015 from a fossil found in the early 1980s in Dorset, England, was named after Anning. The fossil was acquired by Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery, where it was misidentifed as a plaster cast. In 2008, Dean Lomax, from the University of Manchester, recognised it as genuine and worked with Judy Massare, of the State University of New York, to establish it as a new species.\n\nThis cladogram below follows the topology from a 2010 analysis by Patrick S. Druckenmiller and Erin E. Maxwell.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurus\" ear bones were solid, probably transferring water vibrations to the inner ear. Even so, anatomical features demonstrate that it was a visually-oriented predator; it had huge, sensitive eyes, protected by bony shields. Coprolites of \"Ichthyosaurus\" reveal that its diet consisted of fish and squid.\n\nIt was initially believed that \"Ichthyosaurus\" laid eggs on land, but fossil evidence shows that in fact the females gave birth to live young. As such, they were well-adapted to life as fully pelagic organisms (i.e. they never came onto land). The babies were born tail first to prevent them from drowning in the water.\n\nJoseph Victor von Scheffels poem \"Der Ichthyosaurus\" describes its extinction in humouristic verses.

Mizzi was a member of the Pro-Italian Maltese community and showed in his political activity strong support toward Italy's Risorgimento and in defence of the official use of the Italian language and of Italian culture in Malta.\n\nMizzi founded the \"Partito Anti-Riformista\" in 1880 and, later, the \"Partito Nazionale\" (today's Nationalist Party), campaigning for a new constitution for Malta that would be granted in 1849.\n\nMizzi was instrumental to obtain liberal and progressive constitutional changes for the country during the colonial period, and is credited with starting the process which eventually led to Malta's independence.\n\nIn 1871 Fortunato Mizzi married Maria Sofia (Marie Sophie) Folliero de Luna (Marseilles 17-II-1847 - Valletta 5-VIII-1903), daughter of Giuseppe, vice-consul of Naples. They had a son in 1885 by the name of Enrico (\"Nerik\") who in 1950 became Prime Minister of Malta shortly before dying.\n\nA \"lapide\" (plaque) with an epitaph to the memory of Fortunato Mizzi was placed at Mizzi’s former house at 15 Old Mint Street, Valletta, in 1922. The plaque was inaugurated in 1922 by then-Prime Minister Joseph Howard in the presence of Sir Filippo Sciberras, other members of the National Assembly and a very large crowd of supporters. The epitaph, in Italian, mentioned Fortunato Mizzi having lived and died in that house and exalted his many virtues and his dedication towards the national cause. It carried a bronze effigy of Mizzi in a roundel made by the Russian émigré sculptor Boris Edwards.\n\nA bust of Fortunato Mizzi, inaugurated in 1940, can be seen in the Pincio gardens in Rome alongside the one of Pasquale Paoli.\n\nOn 8 June 1940 an anti-Italian protest, stirred by the unveiling of the bust of Fortunato Mizzi at the Pincio gardens in Rome the day before, destroyed the plaque in Valletta. \n\nA new \"lapide\" to Fortunato Mizzi was prepared in Italy, sculpted by Orlando Paladini Orlandini, made from white travertine marble, measuring 2 x 1.27 metres per 400 kg wight. It carried an identical replica of the epitaph, flanked by two massive fasces, surmounted by a bronze bust of Mizzi. The replica lapide was meant to be placed at the same place in Valletta once the island fell to Italian forces. Italy declared war on Great Britain and France two days after the protests in Valletta. In 1941 the lapide was moved to the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence for display amongst the memorials of Italy’s great and mighty. It was moved to storage in 1943 and remained there till 2019, when it was gifted to Malta by the Opera di Santa Croce .

(At the time, the name \"Nebraska\" could loosely refer to areas west of the Missouri River.) The Republican Party grew out of the Anti-Nebraska movement.\n\nMost in the anti-Nebraska movement considered the Kansas–Nebraska Act to be a unilateral pro-Southern revision to the supposedly final Compromise of 1850, and a nefarious violation of the terms of the Missouri Compromise. Many were deeply alarmed by the prospect of new slave states being established in northern areas formerly reserved for free white settlers. The issue of not extending slavery into new areas was different from the issue of abolishing slavery in areas where it already existed, and only a minority of Kansas-Nebraska act opponents were abolitionists in the strict sense.\n\nThe first prominent public manifestation of opposition to the act was the Appeal of the Independent Democrats in January 1854. This was followed by locally organized \"anti-Nebraska\" meetings in many parts of the United States. Supporters included members of the Free Soil Party, Conscience Whigs, and anti-slavery-extension Democrats. Some were seeking to organize a new political party devoted to anti-slavery-extension principles, while others did not intend to repudiate their existing political affiliations, but merely wished to ally with those of diverse political views on the single issue of opposing the Kansas-Nebraska Act.\n\nOpinion against the expansion of slavery continued to be politically important in the North after the Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854. Simultaneously, the Whig Party was disintegrating at the national level, and there was competition between those who wished to take advantage of this situation to organize a major new party based on anti-slavery-extension principles, and those who wished to organize a new party based on anti-immigration and anti-Catholicism. At first in many areas the \"American Party\" or Know-Nothings seemed to benefit most from the dissolution of the Whigs, but after various complicated political maneuverings (sometimes involving local \"fusion ticket\" alliances), by 1856 the anti-slavery Republican Party, the organized successor to the anti-Nebraska movement, was one of the two largest parties in the United States (see 1856 United States presidential election).\n\nSalmon Chase was one of the prominent figures in the anti-Nebraska movement. Abraham Lincoln re-entered politics as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (after a period when he devoted himself to his law practice), and was a prominent local anti-Nebraska speaker in central Illinois.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951938", "title": "Epineurium", "text": "Epineurium\n\nThe epineurium is the outermost layer of dense irregular connective tissue surrounding a peripheral nerve. It usually surrounds multiple nerve fascicles as well as blood vessels which supply the nerve. Smaller branches of these blood vessels penetrate into the perineurium. In addition to blood vessels which supply the nerve, lymphocytes and fibroblasts are also present and contribute to the production of collagen fibers that form the backbone of the epineurium. In addition to providing structural support, lymphocytes and fibroblasts also play a vital role in maintenance and repair of the surrounding tissues.\n\nWhen the spinal nerve leaves the vertebral canal via an intervertebral foramen, two layers of the spinal meninges, the arachnoid and the dura invaginate the nerve to form a dural sleeve of connective tissue, which is the epineurium. The outer portion of this sleeve comprises the external epineurium which permits longitudinal nerve excursion and absorption of longitudinal stress. The layer of the epineurium that extends within the nerve to define the fascicles is termed the internal epineurium. Together, these two layers form the epineurium, which varies in thickness along the course of a nerve. The epineurium is usually most abundant around joints, as its function is to protect the nerves from stretching and subsequent injury. A common surgical procedure to repair a torn nerve via the epineurium is termed an epineurial repair.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951945", "title": "Culture of Austria", "text": "Culture of Austria\n\nAustrian culture has been influenced by its past and present neighbours: Italy, Poland, Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia.\n\nVienna, the capital city of the 2nd Republic of Austria had long been an important centre of musical innovation. Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the Nobility, and made Vienna the European one of the capitals of classical music. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johann Strauss, Jr., among others, were associated with the city. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian-Szekely folk forms influenced Austrian music. Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments including the lute.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the classical-music era dominated European classical music, and the city of Vienna was an especially important place for musical innovation. Three composers arose, making lasting innovations: Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonic patterns, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's balance between melody and form, and Joseph Haydn's development of the string quartet and sonata.\n\nThe Musikverein in Vienna is considered to be one of the three finest concert halls in the world and was opened on January 6, 1870. Since 1939, the famous Vienna New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic is broadcast from its Golden Hall to an audience of one billion in 44 countries. The members of the Vienna Philharmonic, which is regularly considered one of the finest orchestras in the world, are chosen from the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera.\n\nThe Vienna Philharmonic can trace its origins to 1842, when Otto Nicolai formed the Philharmonische Academie. This orchestra took all its decisions by a democratic vote of all its members, and these are principles still held today.\n\nThe Vienna State Opera, in German called Staatsoper, is one of the most important opera companies in the world. It employs over 1000 people, and in 2008, the annual operating budget of the Staatsoper was 100 million Euros with slightly more than 50% coming in the form of a state subsidy.\n\nIt is also venue for the Vienna Opera Ball, an event that takes place on the Thursday preceding Ash Wednesday. The Opera Ball was first held 1936, and has seen up to 12,000 visitors. 180 pairs are opening the ball officially, before the command \"Alles Walzer\", based on a tradition of Johann Strauss Jr., the dance floor is opened for everyone.\n\nThe Vienna Boys' Choir (German: \"Wiener Sängerknaben\") is one of the best known boys' choirs in the world. Known for its exceedingly high vocal standard, the choir has worked with musicians including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Antonio Caldara, Antonio Salieri and Anton Bruckner.\n\nThe choir was established by a letter written by Maximilian I of Habsburg on 30 June 1498. Palais Augarten serves as rehearsal space and boarding school for the boys of the choir.\n\nThe most popular form of modern Austrian folk music is Viennese Schrammelmusik, which is played with an accordion and a double-necked guitar. Modern performers include Roland Neuwirth, Karl Hodina, and Edi Reiser.\n\nYodeling is a type of throat singing that was developed in the Alps. In Austria, it was called \"juchazn\" and featured the use of both nonlexical syllables and yells that were used to communicate across mountains.\n\nAustrian folk dancing is mostly associated with Schuhplattler, Ländler, Polka, or Waltz. However, there are other dances, such as Zwiefacher, Kontratänze, and Sprachinseltänze.\n\nThe ländler is a folk dance of uncertain origin. Known as a folk song under several names for a long period, it became known as \"Landl ob der Enns\", which was eventually shortened to \"ländler\". The dance became popular in about 1720. It required close contact between members of the opposite sex, and was thus denounced as lustful by some church authorities. Ländlers were brought first to Vienna, and later to places as far away as the Ukraine. The ländler eventually evolved into what is known as the waltz.\n\nDJ Ötzi received the Amadeus Austrian Music Award in 2001 and 2002 for being the Austrian artist most successful internationally. The beatboxing group Bauchklang received an Amadeus in 2002 in the category group pop/rock national. Falco, Rainhard Fendrich, André Heller, Georg Danzer and Christina Stürmer all received Amadeus Awards in the category artist pop/rock national.\n\nAustria3 was a conglomerate of three Austrian quite individualist singer-songwriters Wolfgang Ambros, Georg Danzer and Rainhard Fendrich, on stage from 1997 to 2006.\n\nStarting around 2010, the \"Neue Österreichische Welle\" (\"New Austrian Wave\") is gaining popularity. Its contributors are, for example, Nino Aus Wien, Bilderbuch, Wanda, Kreisky, Voodoo Jürgens, Schmieds Puls. From around 2015 on, the Austrian Cloud Rap scene starts to grow. It is represented most notably by Crack Ignaz and Yung Hurn.\n\nThis genre of punk rock, whose name may be shortened to \"alpunk\" originated in the Alpine regions of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. Alpunk fuses the chaotic, energetic rhythms of punk music with the accordion-based folk music that the region is famous for.\n\nApparently, the musical \"The Sound of Music\" and the film based on it played a role in shaping how mainly the English speaking world sees Austria in terms of music. It has to be said that some of the arrangements in \"The Sound of Music\" have been done for the purpose of art, rather than for the purpose of giving a realistic view on Austrian music culture. So for example there is the view that the song \"Edelweiss' is actually the national anthem of Austria, which is not the case. Moreover, the Ländler performed in the movie is not a traditional Ländler.\n\nAustrian literature can be divided into two main divisions, namely the period up until the mid 20th century, and the period subsequent, after both the Austro-Hungarian and German empires were gone. Austria went from being a major European power, to being a small country. In addition, there is a body of literature that some would deem Austrian but is not written in German.\n\nComplementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Bernhard, and Robert Musil, and of poets Georg Trakl, Franz Werfel, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Adalbert Stifter. Famous contemporary Austrian playwrights and novelists include Elfriede Jelinek and Peter Handke.\n\nAustria is famous for its castles, palaces and buildings, among other architectural works. Some of Austria's most famous castles include Festung Hohensalzburg, Burg Hohenwerfen, Castle Liechtenstein, and the Schloß Artstetten. Many of Austria's castles were created during the Habsburg reign.\n\nThe Historic Centre of the City of Salzburg was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1996, stating that \"Salzburg has managed to preserve an extraordinarily rich urban fabric, developed over the period from the Middle Ages to the 19th century when it was a city-state ruled by a prince-archbishop.\"\n\nThree years later, the City of Graz - Historic Centre followed Salzburg, as the \"old city is a harmonious blend of the architectural styles and artistic movements that have succeeded each other since the Middle Ages, together with cultural influences from the neighbouring regions.\"\n\nIn 2001, finally the Historic Centre of Vienna was listed as World Heritage Site, with the comment that the \"historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, as well as the late-19th-century Ringstrasse lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.\"\n\nAlthough not listed as World Heritage Site many other cities in Austria have a well-preserved Historic Centre, such as Linz or Innsbruck.\n\nAustria is rich in Roman Catholic tradition. One of Austria's oldest cathedrals is the Minoritenkirche in Vienna. It was built in the Gothic style in the year 1224. One of the world's tallest cathedrals, the 136-meter-tall (446-foot-tall) Stephansdom is the seat of the Archbishop of Vienna; the Stephansdom is 107 meters (351 ft) long and 34 meters (111.5 ft) wide. The St. Martin's Church in Linz was for a long time the oldest preserved church in Austria (first documented mention in 799); according to recent research, the current floor plan is from the 10th or 11th Century (Romanesque style). The New Cathedral, also located in Linz, is the largest (130 meters (426.5 ft) long, and the ground 5,170 square meters (55,649 square ft)) cathedral in Austria.\n\nTwo of the most famous Austrian palaces are the Belvedere and Schönbrunn. The baroque-style Belvedere palace was built in the period 1714–1723, by Prince Eugene of Savoy, and now is home to the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere. Schönbrunn palace was built in 1696 by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach for Emperor Leopold I; empress Maria Theresa of Austria ordered the palace restyled in Rococo. In 1996, it was added to the United Nations' World Cultural Heritage list.\n\nAustria is also known for its cemeteries. Vienna has fifty different cemeteries, of which the Zentralfriedhof is the most famous. The Habsburgs are buried in the Imperial Crypt.\n\nStift Melk is a Benedictine abbey in the federal state of Lower Austria, overlooking the Danube as it flows through the Wachau Valley. The abbey was formed in 1089 on a rock above the city of Melk.\n\nThe Semmering Railway, a famous engineering project constructed in the years 1848–1854, was the first European mountain railway built with a standard-gauge track. Still fully functional, it is now part of the Austrian Southern Railway. It was appointed a World Heritage Site in 1998.\n\nThe Vienna Secession was part of a varied movement around 1900 that is now covered by the general term Art Nouveau.\n\nMajor figures of the Vienna Secession were Otto Wagner, Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Koloman Moser.\n\nTobias Seicherl drawn by Viennese caricaturist and cartoonist Ladislaus Kmoch, can be regarded as the first continental European daily comic strip. The comic appeared in the Austrian tabloid 'Das Kleine Blatt' (1930–1940) and was very popular.\n\nThe Prix Ars Electronica is a major award in the field of electronic and interactive art, computer animation, digital culture and music. Since 1987, this award has been given by Ars Electronica, one of the world's major centers for art and technology, which in turn was founded in 1979 in Linz, Austria. The connected museum is the six floor Ars Electronica Center\n\nIn the silent movie era, Austria was one of the leading producers of movies. Many of the Austrian directors, actors, authors and cinematographers also worked in Berlin. The most famous was Fritz Lang, the director of \"Metropolis\". Following the Anschluss, the German annexation of Austria in 1938, many Austrian directors emigrated to the United States, including Erich von Stroheim, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Hedy Lamarr, Mia May, Richard Oswald and Josef von Sternberg. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Franz Antel was a prolific director of popular comedies. New, younger directors emerged from the 1970s to the 1990s, among them Axel Corti, Michael Haneke, Ulrich Seidl, Michael Glawogger, Barbara Albert, and Götz Spielmann.\n\nAlpine pastures amount to a quarter of the farmland in Austria, where around 500,000 cattle were taken care of by 70,000 farmers at 12,000 sites.\n\nRearing cattle involving seasonal migration between valley and high pastures has shaped a lot of landscape in the Alps, as without it, most areas below 2000 m would be forests.\n\nSome pagan customs survived only in the remote valleys inaccessible to the Roman Catholic Church's influence, other customs were actively assimilated over the centuries. One example is the Perchta, a goddess in Southern Germanic paganism in the Alpine countries, whose name means The Shining One. The Perchta welcome spring time during Fastnacht.\n\nSchoolchildren in Austria are taught to read and write in Standard German (Standarddeutsch, Hochdeutsch) which is the language of business and government in Austria. The Austrian German spoken at home and in local commerce will be one of a number of regional Upper German dialects (either Austro-Bavarian or Alemannic dialects).\n\nWhile strong forms of the various dialects are not normally comprehensible to other native German speakers such as Germans or Swiss, there is virtually no communication barrier between the Austro-Bavarian dialects in Austria and those in Bavaria, Germany. The Central Austro-Bavarian dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the Southern Austro-Bavarian dialects of Tyrol. Viennese, the Austro-Bavarian dialect of Vienna, is most frequently used in Germany for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of Graz, the capital of Styria, speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, e.g. from western Styria. As for Western Austria, the dialect of the state of Vorarlberg and of a small part of North Tyrol has linguistically and culturally more in common with German-speaking Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg or Swabia in Southwest Germany as it is an Alemannic dialect like Swiss German or Swabian German.\n\nAs part of its historic cultural heritage of being a multinational state for centuries (Habsburg Monarchy, Austrian Empire, later Austria-Hungary), modern Austria is not entirely homogenously German-speaking, but has within its borders, albeit small, autochthonous minorities of different native tongue: Hungarian is the most widely spoken of the recognized minority languages spoken in Austria (mostly in Burgenland, where it is an official language, and in Vienna; about 40,000 speakers (0.5% of the Austrian population)). Slovene (24,000) has the same status in Carinthia and Styria. The same is true for Burgenland Croatian (19,000), a variant of Croatian spoken in Burgenland. Furthermore, Czech (18,000), Slovak (10,000) and Romani (6,000) are recognized on the basis of minority rights protection.\n\nAustrian German, especially the Viennese dialect, has taken over some words from Hungarian, Czech, Yiddish or some South Slavic languages to replace words otherwise used in Standard German (such as \"Maschekseitn\" (the other side), from the Hungarian \"a másik\" (the other one), Standard German \"die andere Seite\").\n\nAustrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by Hungarian, Czech, Jewish and Italian cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. Goulash is one example of this. Austrian cuisine is known primarily in the rest of the world for its pastries and sweets. In recent times a new regional cuisine has also developed which is centred on regional produce and employs modern and easy methods of preparation.\n\nEvery state in Austria has some specialities: In Lower Austria they have poppies, in Burgenland polenta, in Styria pumpkin, in Carinthia's many lakes they have fish, in Upper Austria, dumpling play a vital role, for Salzburg the Salzburger Nockerln are famous (a Soufflé), Tyrol has their tyrolean bacon, and Vorarlberg is influenced by the close neighbors Switzerland and the Swabia region in Germany, thus cheese plays a role and cheesy Swabian Spätzle are a specialty there.\n\nVienna has been the capital of Austria for more than a thousand years. It became the cultural centre of the nation and developed its own regional cuisine; as such, Viennese Cuisine bears the unique distinction of being the only kind of cooking named after a city. \n\nThe variety of ingredients sold on the Naschmarkt might lead to the thought of a broadly varied cooking culture. In fact, dishes heavily depending on meat make up typical Viennese cuisine: Wiener schnitzel (veal coated in breadcrumbs and fried), Tafelspitz (boiled beef), Beuschel (a ragout containing veal lungs and heart), and Selchfleisch (smoked meat) with sauerkraut and dumplings are typical of its cooking.\n\nSome sweet Viennese dishes include Apfelstrudel (strudel pastry filled with apples), Millirahmstrudel (milk-cream strudel), Kaiserschmarrn (shredded pancakes served with fruit compotes), and Sachertorte (cake of two layers of chocolate cake with apricot jam in the middle). These and many other desserts will be on offer at one of the many Konditorei of Vienna, where they are generally eaten with coffee in the afternoon.\n\nLiptauer as a spread, or Powidl also as spread or base for dumplings are also quite popular.\n\nThe culture of coffee houses in the West began in Austria and remains a fixture of its culture. Much of the reputation these achieved during the turn of the 19th century resulted when writers like Peter Altenberg, Karl Kraus, Hermann Broch and Friedrich Torberg decided to use them as places of work and socializing. Celebrated Austrian writer Peter Altenberg is rumoured to have given \"Wien 1, Café Central\" as his private address, as he spent so much time in Café Central. Artists, thinkers, and political radicals of the period such as Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and even Leon Trotsky were regular coffee house patrons.\n\nAustria has a long winemaking tradition and produces both white and red varieties. Evidence of wine in urns in the area of Zagersdorf in Burgenland dates viticulture back to 700 B.C.\n\nAustria has over 50,000 hectares of vineyard, almost all of it in the east or southeast of the country. Many of the approximately 20,000 small wine-producing estates base their finances on their direct retail of wine. Due to a decree that goes back to the so-called \"Maria Theresianische Buschenschankverordnung\" from 1784, a vintner can sell his own wine in his own house without any dedicated license to do so.\n\nThe Grüner Veltliner is the dominant grape varietal cultivated in Austria, and the dry white wines produced from this grape have gained international recognition.\n\nThere are many different types of Austrian beer to be found. One of the most common brands of beer to be found in Austria is Stiegl, founded in 1492.\n\nCommon sports in Austria are football (soccer), skiing, and ice hockey. Since Austria straddles the Alps, it is a prime location for skiing. Austria is the leading nation in the Alpine Skiing World Cup (consistently winning the largest number of points of all countries) and also strong in many other winter sports such as ski jumping. Austria's national ice hockey team ranks 13th in the world.\n\nAustria (particularly Vienna) also has an old tradition in football, even though, since World War II, the sport has more or less been in decline in the country. The Austrian Championship (originally only limited to Vienna, as there were no professional teams elsewhere), has been held since 1912. The Austrian Cup has been held since 1913. The Austria national football team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup seven times, but did not qualify for a European Championship, until the 2008 tournament when it qualified as co-hosts with Switzerland. The governing body for football in Austria is the Austrian Football Association.\n\nThe first official world chess champion, Wilhelm Steinitz was from the Austrian Empire.\n\nAlso, Vienna is well known for the Spanish Riding school, where skilled riders ride Lipizzaner horses in difficult poses and dances.\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa instituted the \"General School Regulations, in 1774\", creating the Austrian educational system. Eight-year compulsory education was introduced in 1869. Currently, compulsory schooling lasts nine years.\n\nFour years of elementary school (Volksschule for ages 6–10) are followed by secondary education in a Hauptschule, or the first four years of Gymnasium as intermediate school. It has to be noted that in particular in the rural areas, there is quite often no gymnasium available, so everyone attends the hauptschule.\n\nAfter the age of 14, students have their first real choice to make, no matter which they have attended until then. They can spend a year at the polytechnic school which qualifies them for vocational school as part of an apprenticeship. Or they can go to the Höhere Technische Lehranstalt (HTL), which are technically orientated higher colleges and a unique feature of the Austrian educational system within Europe. Finalising the HTL permits to use the title \"Ing.\" (Engineer). Another option would be the Handelsakademie with a focus on accounting and business administration. Finally there is the Gymnasium which ends with the Matura exam as the ultimate preparation for a further education at a university. There are a couple of other school types not mentioned here.\n\nAn alternative to university is the Austrian Fachhochschule, which is more practically oriented than a university but also leads to an academic degree. As part of the Bologna process, both the education at universities as well as at the Fachhochschulen changes.\n\nFederal laws enforce uniformity across provinces throughout the educational system.\n\nAll state-run schools are free of charge. The largest university is the University of Vienna.\n\nAs in 2001 about 73.6% of the native population identify themselves as Roman Catholic, while 4.7% consider themselves Protestant. Some 400,000 Austrians are members of diverse Muslim communities, about 180,000 are members of the Eastern Orthodox Church, about 10,000 are Buddhist and about 7,300 are Jewish. Prior to the Holocaust, about 200,000 Jews lived in Austria.\n\nAbout 12% of the population does not belong to any church or religious community.\n\nSince Roman Catholicism is the predominant Christian denomination in Austria, most of the public holidays are Catholic ones. At the same time, and in contrast to Switzerland or Germany, Good Friday is a public holiday not just for Catholics, but for all citizens belonging to any denomination that observes Good Friday.\n\nAlthough most holidays in Austria are defined in the federal labour law (\"Arbeitsruhegesetz\"), some are due to other sources of law such as social partnership collective contracts (see: Austria's \"social partnership\"). Due to the special emphasis that the Austrian labour law puts on the collective contract, in Austria such contracts are not limited to members of the union that negotiated the contract. This means that the collective contract is actually more like a law than a union agreement.\n\nIn addition to national holidays, some holidays are defined on a state-by-state basis. Abbreviations for the Austria states are described in States of Austria.\n\nEaster Sunday and Whitsun are not listed below, since these will always by definition fall on a Sunday and are therefore already regulated by Sunday laws.\n\n1) Holiday according to the federal labor law, but applies only to the followers of the Reformed churches and Lutheran Church, the Old Catholic Church and the Methodist Church.\n\n2) If 8 December is a working day, employees may work in shops.\n\n3) Until 2003 it was also a holiday in Upper Austria.\n\n4) A holiday only since 2004.\n\n5) Holidays by state law, primarily affecting schools and state offices.\n\n6) The total number of holidays that apply for all employees is 13, or 12, if 2) applies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1951954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951954", "title": "Radio with Pictures", "text": "Radio with Pictures\n\nRadio with Pictures was an early music video program, airing on New Zealand broadcaster TV2 (later South Pacific Television) from 1976 to 1989. \"\"RadPix\"\" aired as a weekly, late night series featuring adult and alternative music.\n\nIn 1976, TV2 producer Peter Grattan coordinated pop clips being supplied for no charge by record companies, some of them being unsuitable for the children's or prime time schedule (from artists such as The Tubes, Sex Pistols, Stranglers, etc.) With over sixty \"unusable\" pop clips, Grattan proposed a late night \"radio with pictures\" concept to then-Head of Programs Kevan Moore. Moore was a former producer of \"The C'mon Show\", a popular music series in the 1960s, and had included pop clips in that program.\n\nThe concept was approved and the first thirteen half-hour episodes aired from September through December 1976. \"RadPix\" had no budget and thus no host; instead, imaginative Terry Gilliam-style graphics linked the various pop clips (in later series, similar graphics, by Fane Flaws, were used as part of the opening credits). The first clip to play was Steve Miller's \"Fly Like an Eagle\" and the first show also featured New Zealand band Red Hot Peppers (not to be confused with the Red Hot Chili Peppers). Subsequently, a NZ-based act was featured every week and to end the first series, Grattan produced a \"Keepin' It Kiwi\" special with ten NZ acts. \"RadPix\" also became an avenue for international acts such as Bob Marley, Little Feat, Blondie and Rainbow to gain fans, promote tours and sell records.\n\n\"RadPix\" eventually achieved cult status, and record companies also took note: artists aired on \"RadPix\" would often see substantially increased sales. Also watching was Mike Nesmith (of The Monkees fame); in November 1976, he saw the show in a motel while on a solo NZ tour. Seeing the concept's potential, he returned to America and shared the idea with Robert Pittman. The result was, ultimately, MTV.\n\nBut in 1977, four years prior to MTV, the now popular \"RadPix\" had been allocated a small budget with producer Alan Thurston (died 2008) and its first presenter. Barry Jenkin (the NZ version of BBC TV's John Peel) was passionate about the new, emerging sounds of the day. (e.g.: Neil Young: \"Like a Hurricane\".) It echoed the work he had been doing on his NZ radio broadcast (on Radio Hauraki). With his encyclopedic knowledge of rock and his signature \"Good evening citizens\" introduction, Barry Jenkin (Dr. Rock) helped give the show an alternative edge, cemented later by the arrival of punk rock, the audience for which was fanatical. Jenkin was sometimes noticeably unhappy on air when introducing clips which he believed were unsuitable for the show, particularly anything he perceived to be \"too commercial\".\n\nLater producers' aims were to maximize viewers and thus ensure the series' longevity and so clips by acts like Sweet, Rod Stewart and Suzi Quatro were included. However, clips by ABBA, The Bay City Rollers and Leif Garrett were not. Later, the program expanded on the genres played, and gradually the \"alternative\" music itself became in a sense \"more mainstream\". In the 1980s, production moved from Auckland to Wellington, thus requiring new hosts: Phil O'Brien, Karyn Hay, Dick Driver and new producers; Tony Holden, then Peter Blake, Simon Morris, Brent Hansen who later became President of MTV Europe in the 1990s. Dick (Richard) Driver directed \"RadPix\" in its final years from 1986-1989 (replacing Hay), having been its host following his role as singer in the band Hip Singles (1982). He later became a successful independent producer of factual programmes, including \"Give it a Whirl\", a six-part documentary series documenting the history of New Zealand popular music as well as \"Music Nation\" and \"Chart\". In 2006 he launched the Documentary Channel on the Sky Pay TV platform. In December 2010 he sold the channel to BBC Worldwide.\n\nBefore stereo television broadcasts were commonly available, a simulcast was available on the student radio stations which are now known as b.net. In 1986, a dispute between TVNZ and RIANZ (The Recording Industry Association of NZ) contributed to the demise of \"RadPix\", as RIANZ moved to initiate a \"pay to play\" rule for pop clips. TVNZ refused to pay, reasoning that the record companies benefited from the free TV exposure. The impasse was finally resolved, but in the meantime \"RadPix\" had been taken off air. The show returned to the airwaves at the end of 1986 with Dick Driver hosting, until it was cancelled again in 1989. It was revived briefly in 1991 by the original producer, Peter Grattan, when he became TVNZ's Head of Entertainment (1989–92).\n\n\"Radio with Pictures\" championed New Zealand music for over a decade, giving dozens of \"kiwi\" acts valuable television exposure.\n\nOther notable TVNZ pop clip shows have included \"Ready To Roll\" (1976-1990s) and \"SHAZAM!\" (1982–1988), the first host of which was British TV host Phillip Schofield.\n"}

It was written and produced by Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams (known collectively as The Neptunes). A version of the song, entitled \"The Co-Ed Remix\", was released as the sixth and final single from \"Britney\" on July 29, 2002. The new version also served as the second single from the soundtrack of \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\". \"Boys\" is a R&B and hip hop song, including funk influences. The remix carries a slower tempo than the album version, and both versions are noted to be reminiscent of Janet Jackson. Some critics praised Williams and Spears' chemistry, as well as the production on the track, while others did not think the song worked well.\n\nWhile the song did not perform well on the \"Billboard\" charts in the United States, it reached the top ten on the Belgian charts and in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and charted in the top 20 in Australia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. The song would later be certified Gold in Australia. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was nominated at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for \"Best Video from a Film.\" The clip features Spears and Williams at a party. The singer has performed \"Boys\" a number of times including at the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, on \"Saturday Night Live\", and on several of her concert tours.\n\n\"Boys\" was originally recorded by Janet Jackson before it was given to Spears. The song was originally included on Spears' third, self-titled studio album. It was written and produced by The Neptunes (Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams) — members of American group N.E.R.D.. The song was re-recorded as \"The Co-Ed Remix\", with a slightly different sound, and added featured vocals from Pharrell Williams. Following its inclusion on the \"Austin Powers in Goldmember OST\", it was released as the second single from the soundtrack, following \"Work It Out\", performed by one of the film's stars', Beyoncé. The release also made it the sixth single release to come from \"Britney\". A press release for Maverick Records called the track a standout from the film's soundtrack, and said that Spears' cameo in the film \"brings superstar status to the Fembot brigade.\" The release also stated that the song and video \"stays true to the fractured funk [at] the heart of the film.\" AOL Music premiered the new track on June 13, 2002, and it was streamed more than 1.35 million times, setting a new record an AOL Music \"First Listen.\"\n\n\"Boys\" is a song that combines R&B with hip hop. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it is set in the time signature of common time and has a tempo of 108 beats per minute. While the original \"Britney\" version features Spears solely, \"The Co-ed Remix\" which was released as a single, sees the singer and the song's co-producer, rapper Pharrell Williams trading lines. The remix version of the track contains a slower tempo then that of the original. According to the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\", Williams and Spears put on a \"rap-lite teen-pop tease.\" The song also includes influences of funk music. During the time of the album's release, her official site stated that the song had aspects of 70's soul music and influences of Prince's music. According to Alex Needham of \"NME\", the track takes influence from Janet Jackson. David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said the song was \"cut-rate '80s Janet Jackson.\" Lyrical content sees Spears eying a guy with an intent to \"get nasty.\"\n\nCalling the song \"a decidedly lubricious duet\", Alex Needham of \"New Musical Express\" said that \"She sings about boys, he sings about girls. A simple concept, but an effective one, resulting in Britney’s best single [in] ages.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that The Neptunes' productions on the album, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and \"Boys\" \"swaddle her in writhing, kick-the-can beats, but never have a groove and a verse been so betrayed by a limp chorus.\" Nicki Tranter of \"PopMatters\" said that the remainder of the album was \"tried and tested\" dance-pop, noting \"Boys\" and \"Cinderella\" revisiting \"old Britney territory exploring predictable issues including her love being irreplaceable, her use of the dance floor as an appropriate courting place, and her much-loved girl-ness.\" Leah Greenblatt from \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it a \"popping, Janet-esque groove.\" \"Yale Daily News\" writer Catherine Halaby considered the song \"an envelope-pushing (when you consider her claims of wholesomeness) smutfest.\"\n\nThe staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed \"Boys\" at number 21 on their ranking of Spears' songs, writing that \"anyone who ever fantasized about a mash-up of Britney and Janet Jackson got their wish with this track. [...] ['Boys'] sounds a lot like Miss Jackson’s 1986 smash 'Nasty' [...] For Janet, the record would have been redundant. For Brit, it functions as an apt homage\". This last part being a reference to Jackson recording the song first. Nicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", criticized the remix for omitting the \"euphoric bridge\". Shannon Barbour from \"Cosmopolitan\" called it Spears' fourth greatest song. Nayer Nissim, from \"Pink News\", deemed it \"one of her most sleek and sharp pop hits. The single remix adds an effortlessly cool Pharrell rap that takes it to the next level\". \"Spin\"s Caryn Ganz ranked it as the singer's 20th greatest song; \"the Neptunes’ magical collaborations with the Princess of Pop - a chic bass line, bare-bones beat, and three and a half minutes of Spears cooing about those nasty boys\".\n\nThe song failed to make much of an impact in the United States, only appearing on the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, where it appeared at number 22. \"Boys\" is so far Spears’ least successful single in the U.S. It appeared on the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs chart at number 32. In Canada, on the Canadian Singles Chart, the song performed better, reaching number 21. \"Boys\" fared better internationally, appearing in the top 20 in several markets in which it charted. On the UK Singles Chart, the song peaked at number seven. It also peaked in the top ten of the Irish Singles Chart and both the Belgian Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. On the ARIA Singles Chart in Australia, the song spent 12 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 14. \"Boys\" would go on to be certified Gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association. Furthermore, it peaked in the top 20 of the charts in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark.\n\nThe music video for \"Boys\" was directed by Dave Meyers. In the video, a man DJ Qualls, tries to get into a castle which is hosting a party being attended by Spears. When the security guards refuse to grant him access because he's not on the guest list, he begins to scream for Spears (after shouting that he had Fruity Pebbles with P. Diddy). As the music starts, Spears, readying herself for the party in one of the castle's towers, is dancing with a group of women. The scene shifts to a castle courtyard, where Spears and a man are sit at opposite ends of a long table. Following this, Spears walks around a pool, in which she sees a man (Justin Bruening) swimming. As they begin to interact with each other, Pharrell is at the bar with a woman. Spears walks over to him and they begin to talk. Following this, Spears dances with a group of people, including Mike Myers as Austin Powers. Actors Jason Priestley, Justin Bruening and Taye Diggs also make cameo appearances in the video. Its choreography was favorably likened to Janet Jackson. The video was nominated at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Video from a Film, but lost to Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\"\n\nSpears performed \"Boys\" on multiple occasions. She performed the song on February 10, 2002 at the 2002 NBA All-Star Game. She also performed it on the twenty-seventh season of \"Saturday Night Live\" on February 2, 2002. She performed the song as a mash-up with \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" on her ABC special, \"In the Zone\", to promote her fourth album \"In the Zone\". In the United Kingdom, Spears performed the song on \"\". On the 2001 Dream Within a Dream Tour, Spears performed it wearing a tank-top and suspenders. In the tour's extension in 2002, she replaced the original version with the remix on the tour.\n\nOn The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004, it featured male dancers pushing her while she was standing in luggage carts. During her performance of the song on The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the singer performed wearing a military costume, while surrounded by her dancers, some of them riding bicycles. The rendition was described as a \"Rhythm Nation-like military stomp.\" On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, Spears wears a golden cape for a snake charming number of the song. Spears included \"Boys\" on the setlist of her 2013-17 Las Vegas residency, . During this performance, she and her dancers wear neon outfits. Sophie Schillaci from MTV considered the performance \"crowd-pleasing\".\n\nThe song has been performed in a mash up with Justin Bieber's \"Boyfriend\" by Kevin McHale and Darren Criss (respectively as their characters Artie Abrams and Blaine Anderson) in the musical TV series \"Glee\" in the second episode of season four, \"Britney 2.0\" (aired on September 20, 2012), which is also the show's second tribute episode to Spears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Guitarist Bernard Butler has said that its musical inspiration was \"The Shoop Shoop Song\", famously remade by Cher for the 1990 film \"Mermaids\". The guitar solo, according to Butler was inspired by The Kinks' \"You Really Got Me\". Other than its nod to the robot from the 80s children's sitcom of the same name, singer Brett Anderson has said the song was inspired by Daisy Chainsaw vocalist KatieJane Garside. Charting in the top-twenty in the UK, the single earned the band their first appearance on \"Top of the Pops.\n\nEurope's radio newsweekly \"Music & Media\" wrote: \"Good song, good band; sometimes life is too simple. Sounding as if recorded in their own rehearsal room, the spirit of real rock roll is there with plenty of flower power.\" The song was well-received in the US. \"Billboard\" wrote: \"It's toe-tapping, head-bobbing, club-rocking stuff, reminiscent of British music from the Kinks to Bowie.\" Linda Ryan of the \"Gavin Report\" said: \"it's a tough, angst-ridden sound that smacks of frustration, the sexual kind... the guitars are loud and tough and guaranteed not to sound like any other guitar-oriented (read: grunge) band on your playlist.\" Performed by the group on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", it became the only Suede single to crack the US Modern Rock Tracks top 10, peaking at No. 7 on 26 June 1993, nine weeks after first appearing on the chart.\n\nAll songs written by Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler.\n\n7\" Vinyl, Cassette\n\n12\" Vinyl, CD\n"}

Its principal business is Consumers Energy, a public utility that provides electricity and natural gas to more than 6 million of Michigan's 10 million residents. Its non-utility businesses are focused primarily on domestic independent power production. Consumers Energy has operated since 1886.\n\nCMS Enterprises' primary businesses are independent power production and natural gas transmission.\n\nCMS Energy was formed in 1987 as a holding company with its principal subsidiaries as Consumers Energy and CMS Enterprises. On October 23, 1987, CMS Energy became a publicly owned company and was listed at the New York Stock Exchange. The company's history dates back to 1886, when William Augustine Foote and Samuel Jarvis initially approached Jackson, Michigan officials and asked them to support efforts to illuminate Jackson's downtown with electric arc lights. They formed a company, Jackson Electric Light Works in 1888. In 1889, they built a hydro plant project at the Trowbridge Dam on the Kalamazoo River. Foote, after seeing some early success, began consolidating his small power companies and formed Commonwealth Power Company.\n\nIn 1907, Foote and Jarvis built Croton Hydro project on the Muskegon River, the first project in the world that could transmit 110,000 volts of electricity. In 1920, Foote and Jarvis offered preferred shares of their company to the public to secure sufficient financing to enter other energy and power generation sectors. Over the next decades the company built several coal-fired, natural gas, nuclear and electric facilities. In 1946, the company formed a strategic partnership with Panhandle Company to convert former natural gas fields to underground natural gas storage areas. CMS Energy's primary subsidiary, Consumers Energy, announced Michigan's first nuclear power plant in 1961, Big Rock Point in Charlevoix, Michigan.\n\nThe company announced another nuclear plant, Palisades Nuclear Generating Station on Lake Michigan, which first produced electricity in December, 1971 to serve 400,000 people a day. CMS Energy owned the plant until 2006, when it was sold to Entergy. It then announced a gas reforming plant to furnish heat for Michigan homes in 1971. This plant was the first of its kind in North America to produce synthetic gas, converting impure liquid petroleum into pipeline-quality natural gas.\n\nIn 1987, CMS Energy, a holding company with its principal subsidiaries as Consumers Power and CMS Enterprises was formed. Consumers Power was rebranded Consumers Energy in 1997. The firm was one of the first companies to introduce an online billing system in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2001, the firm entered into an exploration agreement with Eritrea for oil exploration in the Dismin Block of the Red Sea.\n\nIn 2003, the firm moved its headquarters to One Energy Plaza in Jackson, Michigan. In 2007, the company announced plans to invest $6 billion in Michigan's energy future to support new power plant technology and identify new energy sources. In 2014, Consumers Energy opened Cross Winds Energy Park in Michigan's Tuscola County and signed a contract with General Electric to supply 621.79-kilowatt wind turbine engines for the project. Which has a total generating capacity of 105 megawatts.\n\nIn 2015, 9 percent of CMS Energy's power comes from renewable energy sources. Primary CMS Energy subsidiary Consumers Energy joined the Wildlife Habitat Council as an active member. By 2007, all power facilities received the Clean Corporate Citizen award from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nConsumers Energy, CMS Energy's primary subsidiary, was named Energy Star Partner of the Year in 2014 and 2015 for excellence in sustainable energy efficiency programs. In 2014, Consumers Energy was ranked among the top 15 most sustainable energy providers. Later that year, CMS Energy received Edison Electric Institute's Index Award for top cumulative shareholder return in the small cap category. The firm received the 2015 Emergency Recovery Award for its electricity restoration efforts during the December 2013 North American storm complex.\n\nIn December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized CMS Energy for spending $3.48 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $29 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $415 million, and increasing executive pay by 79% to $900.4 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.\n\nCMS Energy has helped establish and finance numerous research, educational and cultural institutes in the United States. Consumers Energy was given the William Booth Award in 2013 by The Salvation Army in recognition of its long history of philanthropic activities and leadership for the PeopleCare assistance program.\n\nCMS Energy participates in internship and cooperative education programs to build career opportunities in Michigan. Consumers Energy has also worked on early childhood development and education in Michigan and has also received Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) compliant certificates for its efforts to promote environmental education.\n\n\n"}

Since its release, it has gained critical acclaim and a cult status in North America, but especially within Western Canada. It was both filmed and set in Alberta, particularly in and around Calgary.\n\nIt was filmed entirely with digital cinematography, on a shoestring budget that required many involved with the project to max out their credit cards in order to complete the movie (according to an interview on their official website). Many of the people featured in the movie (including the fist-fighters) were bystanders who thought that the filmmakers were shooting a documentary on the common man.\n\n\"FUBAR\" features characters partly based on a comedy routine performed by David Lawrence and Paul Spence that they developed based on the head-banger subculture. Lawrence, Spence, and Dr. S.C. Lim also appear in Dowse's \"It's All Gone Pete Tong\". (Dr. Lim plays himself in \"FUBAR\" as Dean's doctor. Lim actually is Dowse's personal physician in real life.) The characters of Terry and Dean were later seen again, featured in the Michael Dowse-directed music video \"The Slow Descent Into Alcoholism\" by The New Pornographers.\n\nThis is the story of two lifelong friends, Terry (David Lawrence) and Dean (Paul Spence), who have grown up together: Shotgunning their first beers, forming their first garage band, and growing the great Canadian mullet known as \"Hockey Hair\". The lives of these Alberta everymen are brought to the big screen by documentarian Farrel Mitchner (Gordon Skilling), a young director who decides to take a look at Terry and Dean through a lens, exploring the depths of friendship, the fragility of life, growing up gracefully, and the art and science of drinking beer \"like a man\".\n\nTheir lives are complicated by a snubbing by their \"party leader\" Troy, better known as Tron (Andrew Sparacino). When Farrel discovers that Dean is hiding a serious case of testicular cancer, the wheels are set in motion for Dean to seek treatment from Dr. S.C. Lim (Dr. S.C. Lim). With Dean's last weekend before surgery approaching, Terry decides to take Dean, Farrel and the film crew camping. Things take an unexpected turn by the third day, and Terry and Dean must cope with further tragedy.\n\nA soundtrack album, \"FUBAR: The Album\", was released in 2003.\n\nBrandon Ryan reported in April 2009 that funding had been secured for a sequel film. \"FUBAR 2\" was filmed in Edmonton, Alberta. Director Michael Dowse reported that the plot involves Terry and Dean moving to Fort McMurray, Alberta. Once again the dialogue is heavily improvised, and the budget is \"a lot more\" than the first film.\nThe sequel premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on September 9, and was released throughout Canada on October 1.\n\nOn February 10, 2017 Rogers Media and VICE Studios Canada announced an eight-episode television series based on the films to air on Viceland later that year.

The painting is one of the earliest works of the Italian Renaissance painter Piero della Francesca, who was born in the town. The central panel is of the common motif of the \"Virgin of Mercy\" or \"Madonna della Misericordia\". \nIn 1445, the Compagnia della Misericordia, a confraternity of Borgo San Sepolcro, commissioned Piero, a native of the town, to paint a polyptych for them. According to the taste of the time, the polyptych was to be painted with precious colours and have a gilded background. Piero did not respect the three-year time limit set in the contract—he was busy working on many other projects. The polyptych was only finished seventeen years later, in 1462.\n\nThe oldest two panels, to the left of the main panel, depict St Sebastian and St John the Baptist. St Sebastian's panel shows a close connection with Masaccio's nudes, which Piero would have seen in an early visit to Florence. Piero painted the outlying panels of the tympanum later; including the Crucifixion at the top centre, St Benedict, the Angel, the \"Madonna of the Annunciation\", and St Francis in the sides. Towards 1450 he finished the figures of St. Andrew and St. Bernardino. The predellas, with five scenes of Jesus's life, were mostly executed by assistants.\n\nThe last part of the polyptych to be painted was the main central panel showing the \"Madonna della Misericordia\". The panel portrays the mercifully protective gesture of the Madonna enfolding her followers in her mantle.\n\nPiero resolves the difficulty of dealing with a flat solid gilded background, requested by the patrons, by placing the kneeling members of the confraternity (who commissioned the altarpiece) in the realistic three-dimensional space created by the Madonna's mantle, a space resembling the apse of a church. Notably, the Madonna is still portrayed larger in size than the human figures, a tradition in medieval painting. However, the fully three-dimensional rendering of the figure, inspired by Masaccio, and the perspective study, inspired by Brunelleschi, are plainly of the Renaissance.\n\n"}

It was founded in 2000 by several Unitarian Universalists who felt that the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) had become too theologically liberal and too political. They decided their mission was to promote classical Unitarianism, which they argued as being based on Christian beliefs though not solely confined by them. They also hoped their organization would be of interest to non-Christians who embrace generic or philosophical theism and Deism.\n\nUnitarianism as understood within the AUC has as a main tenet the belief in God as one person as opposed to trinitarianism which holds to the belief in a God of three persons. Among the classical Unitarian principles that the AUC promotes are the unity and providence of God, the compatibility of faith and reason, and the ability of religion and science to work together to improve the human condition.\n\nIn classical Unitarian fashion, the AUC does not require adherence to a creed to become a member. All who are in agreement with the AUC's religious principles, regardless of denominational affiliation or lack thereof, may join. The AUC does not exclude non-Christians, but many if not most of its members are Unitarian Christians.\n\nThe AUC does not engage in political activism or release political statements except in cases that involve religious freedom and church/state separation.\n\nThe AUC is run by volunteers.

YMO made use of synthesizers for the melodies and digital gated reverb for the snare drums. The song has had numerous cover versions produced by other artists, most notably Michael Jackson. Alongside Quincy Jones, Jackson produced a slightly more dance-funk version of the techno classic with additional lyrics, originally intended for his best-selling album \"Thriller\" (1982). Despite the approval of songwriter Sakamoto and lyricist Chris Mosdell, it was eventually removed from the \"Thriller\" album due to legal issues with Yellow Magic Orchestra's management. Nevertheless, various cover versions were later performed by Greg Phillinganes, Eric Clapton (with Phillinganes as part of his backing band), Orbital, and The Human League, among others, before Jackson's cover version eventually appeared on his posthumous \"Michael\" album in 2010.\n\n\"Technopolis\" is considered an \"interesting contribution\" to the development of techno, specifically Detroit techno, as it used the term \"techno\" in its title, was a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca, and foreshadowed concepts that Juan Atkins and Rick Davis would later have with Cybotron. \n\nThe album's title song \"Solid State Survivor\" is a new wave synth rock song.

It was produced off-Broadway in 1990 by Edgar Lansbury, Angela Lansbury's brother and, later, locally by the Foundation Theater at Burlington County College, among others.\n\nMrs. Little won numerous awards for her work over the years, including six national awards from the Poetry Society of America. In 1996, she was honored with an award from a Japanese city for her haiku writing. She was a past president of the Haiku Society of America and a past vice president of Poetry Society of America.\n\nShe was an adjunct instructor in writing and English literature at Burlington County College for more than a decade and had previously taught at Rutgers and Trenton State College. She was well known for her appearances at writing conferences and as a lecturer for adults as well as children.\n\nAsked if she had a favorite work, she would say, 'No. Your poems are like your children—you don't pick favorites.'\n\nPoet Karen Swenson, winner of the 1993 National Poetry Series award, recalled that Mrs. Little's works stood out because of their \"unusual clarity and precision of form... and were full of wonderful imagery.\"\n\nShe also sang, and her singing career included performing with the Choral Arts Society of Philadelphia, the major choral group associated with the Philadelphia Orchestra. She also performed with a company specializing in the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. Her son recalled, \"She really loved her singing. She sang with the group until about six months before her death. She could hardly walk but was still there singing.\"\n\nLittle also sang for the choir of the First Presbyterian Church of Moorestown Township, New Jersey.\n\n"}

The main building is of the Early Gothic style, while the adjoining structures are of a transitional period reflective of a combination of both Gothic and Norman styles. The exterior appearance of the Cathedral itself is reminiscent of Gloucester Cathedral in England.\n\nThe Cathedral is located in Bryn Athyn, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania just outside the city of Philadelphia. Bryn Athyn is also the site of the General Church affiliated Academy of the New Church, which publishes Swedenborgian literature, and is the parent organization of a high school, a four-year college (Bryn Athyn College of the New Church), a theological school, and the Emanuel Swedenborg Library.\n\nThe Cathedral was constructed from 1913-1919. The Cathedral's initial design was by the Boston architecture firm of Ralph Adams Cram. The planning of the Cathedral began under the direction of William Fredrick Pendleton, the Bishop of the Church, and John Pitcairn, Jr., president of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG Industries), who was the major benefactor donating the property and much of the funds to construct the cathedral.\n\nRaymond Pitcairn, John Pitcairn's son, became involved with the project and worked with the firm of Ralph Adams Cram. As time passed, the architecture firm became less involved with the work leaving Raymond Pitcairn in charge. Mr. Pitcairn realized that the workers and artisans working on the cathedral should be directly employed by the church and that creative changes by artists and builders working together which happen during the design process should be nurtured rather than thwarted. This led to some very unorthodox construction practices. For example, rather than relying on blueprints and plans, almost every aspect of the design was made into scale models where Mr. Pitcairn and the workers could study, review and embellish their ideas before actually constructing them.\n\nAnother aspect of the cathedral which is unusual is that asymmetries and irregularities were planned into the building as it was built. This is largely the result of Raymond Pitcairn's attendance at a 1915 lecture by William Goodyear who stated that irregularities and asymmetries in medieval buildings were not errors but were carefully planned in the structures.\n\nThe stained glass windows of Bryn Athyn Cathedral are worthy of note. The medieval method of creating stained glass, namely of melting various pigment and metallic oxides into the glass itself and then having a glass blower create a disk of glass with varying degrees of thickness and brightness, was revived. The first glass was blown in 1922 and the last was created in the 1940s, however all the windows themselves were not completed till the 1960s. The windows are essentially of three designs:\n\nMost of the metal in the cathedral is Monel Metal.\n\nThe Ezekiel Tower, located south of the main 150 ft tower, was built between the years 1920-1926. \nThe Choir Hall and Michael Tower lie to the north of the main cathedral. This addition was completed in 1929 and even though this is the last completed portion of the complex, its architecture is from the earliest period.\n\nRight next to the college, the library and the cathedral is the Academy-affiliated Glencairn Museum. Originally the private residence of Raymond Pitcairn, this castle-like building now houses a collection of mostly religious artwork from around the world and is open to the public.\n\nThe cathedral is part of the Bryn Athyn Historic District, which was listed as a National Historic Landmark on October 7, 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "1952014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952014", "title": "Animal Nitrate", "text": "Animal Nitrate\n\n\"Animal Nitrate\" is the third single by Suede, released on Nude Records in 1993 and later included on the band's debut album \"Suede\". It charted at number seven on the UK Singles Chart, making it the highest-charting single from the album. The song is the band's highest-charting single in Ireland and New Zealand, peaking at number 11 in both countries. It also debuted and peaked at number 21 in Sweden but stayed on the chart for only two weeks.\n\nSuede had received widespread media coverage in the year leading up to the release of the debut album in March 1993. \"Animal Nitrate\", released one month before the album was the third in a triptych of singles following on from the successful first two singles, \"The Drowners\" and \"Metal Mickey\". The title of the song is a reference to the inhalant drug amyl nitrite, although singer Brett Anderson has said it has more to do with other drugs like ecstasy and cocaine. The idea of the song came about when Anderson went through a period where, he says: \"drugs were taking the place of people.\" Chris Jones, reviewing Suede's debut album for the BBC, concurred. \"Despite its punning title it’s a thrill-seeking slice of cynicism that perfectly summed up what it was like to be young and chemically imbalanced in the nation’s capital at the time.\"\n\nThe original working title for the song was \"Dixon\", as guitarist Bernard Butler's guitar part during the chorus was inspired by the intro to popular BBC television series \"Dixon of Dock Green\". The song was almost overlooked as a single. While initially, Anderson was convinced that the ballad \"Sleeping Pills\" would be the third single; he was overruled by Nude Records owner Saul Galpern, who insisted that \"Nitrate\" had the broader commercial appeal as a single. Speaking to \"NME\" in 2013 on writing the song, Anderson said: \"We were rehearsing it for months and months and Bernard kept asking me if I had any lyrics for it and I wanted something special to say over the top of what he’s written. I like the fact it’s a song about a dark, murky world that ended up in the Top 10.\" Indeed, Anderson had stated in the first \"Melody Maker\" cover story in April 1992 that his fantasy was to have written a top-ten UK single about \"some bizarre sexual experience.\"\n\nThe video for the title track was directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The band caused some controversy with the video as scenes involving a fat lady in a bikini, and someone kissing a man with a pig's head were cut from various screenings. In the UK, the ITV network refused to air the video during daytime programming as it features scenes of two men kissing and embracing. \"[The video] was too contentious for the Saturday lunchtime slot,\" said an ITV spokesperson. Howard Wuelfing, a New York publicist for Columbia Records, defended the video as mere \"flirting with sexual imagery... through androgyny.\" The band took cocaine to prepare for the video. Anderson wanted to replicate the energy of their live shows, he explained: \"We weren't experienced enough at the time to just do it on cue. I think we ended up getting a load of coke in and jumping around like lunatics. Back in the days when we used to do things like that.\" The video was filmed in Lisson Green housing estate in the London borough City of Westminster. The band reportedly used flat number 18 and paid the occupants a tenner for the inconvenience caused. It won the first MTV Euro Video Song Contest in 1993.\n\nThe song was first performed live six months before its actual release at the 1992 Reading Festival. Throughout late 1992, the song would feature at many of Suede's UK live shows along with many other songs which made it on to the album. It would receive its largest audience when the band played the song at the 1993 Brit Awards one week prior to its release. When the \"NME\" heard that Suede had been left off the nominations for the Brit Awards, they began a weekly campaign to get them to perform at the awards on the night. The song was nominated for Best British Single at the following year's Brit Awards. The single was released 22 February 1993 and became the band's first top-ten single charting at no. 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The single remained at no. 7 the following week. At the time this was considered a rare feat for an indie band, something which Saul Galpern points to the Brits performance as the reason for its success. It is estimated the performance reached approximately nine million homes. While the song's subject matter may not have particularly appealed to the masses, Anderson agreed that it did reach a wide audience due to its hooks and radio friendly appeal. The single was also the band's big breakthrough in Sweden, a country where the band would have long-term future success. Two weeks prior to the release of the single, Sony Music Sweden had ordered finished product directly from Nude Records and sent it to key radio producers, media and retailers. The promotion efforts paid off when \"Animal Nitrate\" became a big radio hit in Sweden and generated strong interest in the band's first Swedish gig. The special showcase in Stockholm on the second date of the band's European tour on 21 April 1993 was sold out the month before. The single peaked on the Swedish charts at no. 21 on 24 March.\n\n\"Billboard\" wrote: \"Follow-up to debut U.S. single 'Metal Mickey' not as hard-hitting, but a strong cut no less. Sound is skewed toward power pop, with emphasis on heavy melody and stomping rhythms. Perhaps too much emphasis on the latter, however, as single lacks fluidity. Much-touted lead singer Brett Anderson wrenches his vocals from the gut, recalling early performances from Duran Duran's Simon LeBon.\" \"The Age\" awarded it 'Single of the Week', writing: \"This single is their album's strongest, an irresistible mix of strange guitar riffery, manic rhythm section and a personality desperately craving to be noticed.\" \"Select\" ranked the song at no. 1 in its single of the year for 1993.\n\nIn March 2005, \"Q\" placed \"Animal Nitrate\" at number 97 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In May 2007, \"NME\" magazine placed \"Animal Nitrate\" at number 43 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. In 2012 the same magazine placed the song at number 14 on its 100 Best Tracks of the Nineties. It again recognised the song in 2014 by ranking it at number 33 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. A 2010 Radio X poll of listeners, presenters and a team of experts compiled a list of the top 1000 songs of all time, where \"Animal Nitrate\" ranked at number 60. In 2014, \"Paste\" listed the song at number 29 in its 50 Best Britpop Songs.\n\nCaroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" included the song in her “10 of the Best” Britpop songs. She said that \"Butler’s opening riff is one of the most undeniable in pop.\" \"Louder Sound\" included Butler's guitar solo at no. 94 in their list of the \"100 greatest guitar solos in rock.\"\n\nAll songs written by Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler.\n\n7\" Vinyl, Cassette\n\n12\" Vinyl, CD\n\nBasement covered the song on their 2014 EP \"Further Sky\". Zachary Houle of \"PopMatters\" wrote that the cover \"strip[ped] away all of the glam\" of the original, making it \"a straightforward rock anthem.\" \"Alternative Press\" contributor Brian Kraus considered it \"faithful to the original\" and the best song on the EP. He called it \"a fine fit\" amongst the \"lighthearted moods\" found on the EP. AbsolutePunk staff member Aj LaGambina thought the track \"blend[ed] in as if it\" was one of the band's own compositions. Punknews.org reviewer RENALDO69 called the cover \"tight—knit and sharp\" within the \"very polished\" EP.\n\nIn September 2015 The Libertines performed a live version of the song at a gig at Camden's Dublin Castle in London.\n\n"}
{"id": "1952016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952016", "title": "Scarling.", "text": "Scarling.\n\nScarling. is an American noise pop band from Los Angeles, whose core members are Jessicka and Christian Hejnal-Addams. The band formed in 2002. They have released two albums, \"Sweet Heart Dealer\" and \"So Long, Scarecrow\".\n\nThe band's name comes from a fictional word created by singer/fine artist Jessicka in 1999. In 2001 the definition appeared on Scarling's website: \"Middle English, from Old English scaerlinc, from scar+ -ling, -linc -ling; akin to Old High German von scar, Latin scarnos 1. the smallest mark on your heart left by the healing of a severe injury. 2. he or she who is scarred densely almost emotionless. 3. a mentally challenged/physically handicapped sibling of a normal star. 4. a band from Los Angeles. The \"S\" in Scarling. is sometimes lower case and the word itself ends in a full stop or period.\"\nScarling. was formed by singer Jessicka Fodera (known simply as Jessicka) after the dissolution of her band, Jack Off Jill, and guitarist Christian Hejnal. They were introduced by guitarist Lisa Leveridge, and they began rehearsing and recording in a San Fernando Valley performance space; after the pair had written a number of songs together, they began a search for additional band members and eventually cemented the first and very short-lived lineup of Scarling.\n\nIn early 2002, Jessicka was introduced to Long Gone John, owner of Sympathy for the Record Industry, by mutual friend Mark Ryden. On March 19, 2003, Scarling's debut single, \"Band Aid Covers the Bullet Hole\" (produced by Chris Vrenna), was released on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. Its cover featured an illustration called \"Wound 39\" by Mark Ryden.\n\nIn April 2004, Scarling. released their debut album, \"Sweet Heart Dealer\", a seven-song release again produced by Vrenna and packaged by Ryden. Later that year, Jessicka was featured on the cover of \"ROCKRGRL\" magazine's vocalist issue. Scarling was then invited to join the lineup of the Robert Smith-organized Curiosa Festival, performing on select West Coast dates alongside Interpol, The Rapture, Mogwai, Cursive, The Cooper Temple Clause, and longtime inspirations The Cure. Smith described the band's music as \"dark, desperate, chaotic, gorgeous pop music, the sound of the end of the world\" and nominated \"\"Sweet Heart Dealer\"\" for the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize. While \"Alternative Press Magazine\" said Scarling. sounded like, \"being French kissed by the most beautiful beings in the world, really alluring yet massive stuff.\" Three weeks before joining the Curiosa tour, drummer Garey Snider left and was briefly replaced by Samantha Maloney in order to perform live at a group art showing at the Copro/Nason Gallery (Santa Monica, California). Weeks later they found drummer Beth Gordon, who served as Scarling's permanent replacement. Scarling, with the help of friend and fill-in bassist Radio Sloan, continued to play around Los Angeles and San Francisco at clubs such as The Bottom Of The Hill, Spaceland and The Troubadour.\n\nOn October 21, 2004, John Peel, English disc jockey and radio presenter, invited Robert Smith to stand in for him while he was in Peru as a guest DJ on what turned out to be the last Peel Session show. Smith played Scarling's Crispin Glover as one of the tracks in his eclectic set. Scarling. were also chosen by Smith to be part of his Celebrity Playlist on iTunes along with Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine, Supergrass, Nirvana, Placebo, The Psychedelic Furs, and several bands that played on the Curiosa tour earlier that year. Smith wrote a quote about each song and wrote \"Beautiful shadows\" next to the Scarling. track.\n\nAfter a series of 7\" singles on Sympathy, Scarling announced in early 2005 that their second album, \"So Long, Scarecrow\", would appear later that year; it was preceded by the single \"We Are the Music Makers\", and was released on August 23, 2005. \"So Long, Scarecrow\" was co-produced by Rob Campanella, formerly of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, at his studio, The Committee to Keep Music Evil headquarters. The critical reception for \"Scarecrow\" was generally strong: \"Alternative Press\" gave the album a 5 out of 5 rating. Simon Price from The Independent said, \"In contrast to the abrasive JOJ sound, Scarling. work up a wonderfully hazy guitar swirl, reminiscent of post-My Bloody Valentine noise-pop from the Britain of the early Nineties.\" Chris Beyond from \"No-Fi Magazine\" described \"Scarecrow\" as \"somewhere between Blonde Redhead and Sonic Youth and said \"there are 13 tracks on this album, but they leave you wanting more.\" Scarling's was touted as resurrecting goth' by \"Venus\" magazine: \"Goth isn’t dead. It’s just evolved into a sweeter version with Scarling’s variety of distorted but, dare I say, gorgeous version of the once-dreary genre. On the band’s full-length debut, So Long, Scarecrow, frontwoman Jessicka’s syrupy yet cautious vocals are quite different than her former angry, self-mutilating persona in the late ’90s Marilyn Manson-esque group Jack off Jill.\"\n\nIn December 2005, Scarling. embarked on its first UK tour, creating a buzz for themselves and selling out most venues. SLS's first single \"City Noise\" is featured on the compilation \"Alright, This Time Just the Girls Vol. 2\" and 2006's \"Staring To The Sun\". The song \"Bummer\" from \"SLS\" was featured on Showtime's \"The L Word\" season 3 episode \"Latecomer\", as well as an Urban Outfitters/Filter magazine compilation. An episode of the medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" (season 2) is titled \"Band Aid Covers the Bullet Hole\".\n\nIn 2006, Scarling continued to tour in the United States and Europe, embarking on their first co-heading with UK shoegaze outfit Amusement Parks on Fire and opening for The Wedding Present and Depeche Mode later in the year.\n\nScarling. currently resides in the neighborhood of Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California. On February 14, 2006 (Valentine's Day), while on a break from touring, Jessicka and guitarist Christian Hejnal were engaged. Their wedding took place on October 13, 2007, at the Oviatt Penthouse in Los Angeles.\n\nScarling. performed at the wedding of Bravo's Shear Genius finalist Janine Jarman and Matthew Wolcott at the Houdini Mansion in Hollywood on June 26, 2010.\n\nJessicka has stated that, after her art show \"Little Grey Secrets\", Scarling. would resume. \nScarling. released their single \"Who Wants To Die For Art?\" digitally in the US on iTunes October 31, 2013.\n\nOn May 13, 2014, Mark Ryden released an album entitled \"The Gay Nineties Old Tyme Music: Daisy Bell\", that features Scarling along with other artists all giving a different rendition of the same song, \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)\". The album, printed on 180 g red vinyl, was limited to 999 copies, all hand-numbered and signed by Ryden. Half of the records were sold at the Michael Kohn gallery. The proceeds from the record will benefit Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit that supports musical education in disadvantaged elementary schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was originally drafted in the second round, 25th overall by the Calgary Flames in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nAs a member of the New York Rangers 1994 Stanley Cup Championship team, Matteau scored two overtime goals in the Eastern Conference Finals against the New Jersey Devils, including one that ended the series and became an iconic goal in Rangers lore. His first overtime goal ended Game 3 at 6:13 of the second overtime in New Jersey giving the Rangers a 3–2 victory and a 2–1 series lead.\n\nHis second goal came at 4:24 of the second overtime of Game 7 at Madison Square Garden. Matteau scored off a wrap around that bounced off a stick on the left side of New Jersey's rookie goaltender Martin Brodeur, a play which has been immortalized by the dramatic play-by-play call of Rangers radio announcer Howie Rose: However, had the puck did not bounced off a stick, Esa Tikkanen would have scored the game winning goal.\n\nMatteau finished his career in 2002–03 with the Florida Panthers and their minor league affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage, and had a career total 742 penalty minutes, 144 goals and 172 assists for 316 total points in 848 games.\n\nMatteau also was a member of the Rouyn Quebec team that played in the Little League World Series in 1982 along with fellow NHL player and first overall pick in his draft, Pierre Turgeon.\n\nMatteau played for head coach Mike Keenan on four separate occasions; with the Blackhawks, Rangers, Blues, and Panthers.\n\nMatteau served as an assistant coach with the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada of the QMJHL for two seasons.

{"id": "1952028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952028", "title": "Japanese militarism", "text": "Japanese militarism\n\nThe military had a strong influence on Japanese society from the Meiji Restoration. Almost all leaders in Japanese society during the Meiji period (whether in the military, politics or business) were ex\"-samurai\" or descendants of \"samurai\", and shared a set of values and outlooks. The early Meiji government viewed Japan as threatened by western imperialism, and one of the prime motivations for the \"Fukoku Kyohei\" policy was to strengthen Japan's economic and industrial foundations, so that a strong military could be built to defend Japan against outside powers.\n\nThe rise of universal military conscription, introduced by Yamagata Aritomo in 1873, along with the proclamation of the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors in 1882 enabled the military to indoctrinate thousands of men from various social backgrounds with military-patriotic values and the concept of unquestioning loyalty to the Emperor as the basis of the Japanese state \"(kokutai)\". Yamagata, like many Japanese, was strongly influenced by the recent striking success of Prussia in transforming itself from an agricultural state to a leading modern industrial and military power. He accepted Prussian political ideas, which favored military expansion abroad and authoritarian government at home. The Prussian model also devalued the notion of civilian control over the independent military, which meant that in Japan, as in Germany, the military could develop into a state within a state, thus exercising greater influence on politics in general.\n\nFollowing the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War, the Army Staff College and the Japanese General Staff paid close attention to Major Jakob Meckel's views on the superiority of the German military model over the French system as the reason for German victory. In response to a Japanese request, Prussian Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke sent Meckel to Japan to become an O-yatoi gaikokujin. In Japan, Meckel worked closely with future Prime Ministers General Katsura Tarō and General Yamagata Aritomo, and with army strategist General Kawakami Soroku. Meckel made numerous recommendations which were implemented, including reorganization of the command structure of the army into divisions and regiments, thus increasing mobility, strengthening the army logistics and transportation structure with the major army bases connected by railways, establishing artillery and engineering regiments as independent commands, and revising the universal conscription system to abolish virtually all exceptions. A bust of Meckel was sited in front of the Japanese Army Staff College from 1909 through 1945.\n\nAlthough his period in Japan (1885–1888) was relatively short, Meckel had a tremendous impact on the development of the Japanese military. He is credited with having introduced Clausewitz's military theories and the Prussian concept of war games (\"kriegspiel\") in a process of refining tactics. By training some sixty of the highest-ranking Japanese officers of the time in tactics, strategy and organization, he was able to replace the previous influences of the French advisors with his own philosophies. Meckel especially reinforced Hermann Roesler's ideal of subservience to the Emperor by teaching his pupils that Prussian military success was a consequence of the officer class's unswerving loyalty to their sovereign Emperor, as expressly codified in Articles XI-XIII of the Meiji Constitution.\n\nThe rise of political parties in the late Meiji period was coupled with the rise of secret and semi-secret patriotic societies, such as the Gen'yōsha (1881) and \"Kokuryukai\" (1901), which coupled political activities with paramilitary activities and military intelligence, and supported expansionism overseas as a solution to Japan's domestic issues.\n\nJapan felt looked down on by Western countries during the late 19th century. The phrase fukoku kyōhei (rich nation, strong army) was created during this time and shows how Japanese officials saw imperialism as the way to gain respect and power. With a more aggressive foreign policy, and victory over China in the First Sino-Japanese War and over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan joined the imperialist powers. The need for a strong military to secure Japan's new overseas empire was strengthened by a sense that only through a strong military would Japan earn the respect of western nations, and thus revision of the unequal treaties.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Great Power status was considered dependent on resource-rich colonial empires, both as a source of raw materials for military and industrial production, and international prestige.\n\nDue to the lack of resources in Japanese home islands, raw materials such as iron, oil, and coal largely had to be imported. The success of Japan in securing Taiwan (1895) and Korea (1910) had brought Japan primarily agricultural colonies. In terms of resources, the Japanese military looked towards Manchuria's iron and coal, Indochina's rubber, and China's vast resources. However, the army was at variance with the zaibatsu financial and industrial corporations on how to manage economic expansion, a conflict also affecting domestic politics.\n\nAlso forming part of the basis for the growth of militarism was the freedom from civilian control enjoyed by the Japanese armed forces. In 1878, the Imperial Japanese Army established the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff office, modelled after the German General Staff. This office was independent of, and equal (and later superior) to the Ministry of War of Japan in terms of authority. The Imperial Japanese Navy soon followed with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. These General Staff offices were responsible for the planning and execution of military operations, and reported directly to the emperor. As the Chiefs of the General Staff were not cabinet ministers, they did not report to the Prime Minister of Japan, and were thus completely independent of any civilian oversight or control.\n\nThe Army and the Navy also had decisive say on the formation (and survival) of any civilian government. Since the law required that the posts of Army Minister and Navy Minister be filled by active-duty officers nominated by their respective services, and since the law also required that a prime minister resign if he could not fill all of his cabinet posts, both the Army and the Navy had final say on the formation of a cabinet, and could bring down the cabinet at any time by withdrawing their minister and refusing to nominate a successor. In reality, while this tactic was used only one time (ironically to prevent a General, Kazushige Ugaki, from becoming Prime Minister in 1937), the threat always loomed large when the military made any demands on the civilian leadership.\n\nDuring the Taishō period, Japan saw a short period of democratic rule (the so-called \"Taisho democracy\"), and several diplomatic attempts were made to encourage peace, such as the Washington Naval Treaty and participation in the League of Nations. However, with the beginning of the Shōwa era, the apparent collapse of the world economic order with the Great Depression starting in 1929, coupled with the imposition of trade barriers by western nations and an increasing radicalism in Japanese politics including issues of domestic terrorist violence (including an assassination attempt on the emperor in 1932 and a number of attempted coups d'état by ultra-nationalist secret societies) led to a resurgence of so-called \"jingoistic\" patriotism, a weakening of democratic forces and a belief that the military could solve all threats both domestic and foreign. Patriotic education also strengthened the sense of a \"hakko ichiu\", or a divine mission to unify Asia under Japanese rule.\n\nThose who continued to resist the \"military solution\" including nationalists with unquestionable patriotism, such as generals Jotaro Watanabe and Tetsuzan Nagata and ex-Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara were driven from office or an active role in the government.\n\nA turning point came with the ratification of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi and his \"Minseito\" party agreed to a treaty which would severely limit Japanese naval power. This treaty was strongly opposed by the military, who claimed that it would endanger national defense, and was portrayed by the opposition \"Rikken Seiyukai\" party as having been forced upon Japan by a hostile United States, which further inflamed growing anti-foreign sentiment.\n\nThe Japanese system of party government finally met its demise with the May 15 Incident in 1932, when a group of junior naval officers and army cadets assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. Although the assassins were put on trial and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment, they were seen popularly as having acted out of patriotism and the atmosphere was set where the military was able to act with little restraint.\n\nJapan had been involved in the Asian continent continuously from the First Sino-Japanese War, Boxer Rebellion, Russo-Japanese War, World War I and the Siberian Intervention. During the term of Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi from 1927 to 1929, Japan sent troops three times to China to obstruct Chiang Kai-shek's unification campaign. In June 1928, adventurist officers of the Kwantung Army embarked on unauthorized initiatives to protect Japanese interests in Manchuria, including the assassination of a former ally, warlord Zhang Zuolin, in hopes of sparking a general conflict.\n\nThe Manchurian Incident of September 1931 did not fail, and it set the stage for the Japanese military takeover of all of Manchuria. Kwantung Army conspirators blew up a few meters of South Manchurian Railway Company track near Mukden, blamed it on Chinese saboteurs, and used the event as an excuse to invade and seize the vast territory.\n\nIn Tokyo one month later, in the Imperial Colors Incident, military figures failed in an attempt to establish a military dictatorship, but again the news was suppressed and the military perpetrators were not punished.\n\nIn January 1932, Japanese forces attacked Shanghai in the First Shanghai Incident, waging a three-month undeclared war there before a truce was reached. The civilian government in Tokyo was powerless to prevent these military adventures, and instead of being condemned, the Kwangtung Army's actions enjoyed considerable popular support.\n\nInukai's successors, military men chosen by Saionji Kinmochi, the last surviving genrō, recognized Manchukuo and generally approved the army's actions in securing Manchuria as an industrial base, an area for Japanese emigration, and a potential staging ground for war with the Soviet Union. Various army factions contended for power amid increasing suppression of dissent and more assassinations. In the February 26 Incident of 1936, the Army's elite First Infantry Division staged an attempted coup d'état in yet another effort to overthrow civilian rule. The revolt was put down by other military units, and its leaders were executed after secret trials. Despite public dismay over these events and the discredit they brought to numerous military figures, Japan's civilian leadership capitulated to the army's demands in the hope of ending domestic violence. Increases were seen in defense budgets, naval construction (Japan announced it would no longer accede to disarmament treaties), and patriotic indoctrination as Japan moved toward a wartime footing.\n\nIn November 1936, the Anti-Comintern Pact, an agreement to exchange information and collaborate in preventing communist activities, was signed by Japan and Germany (Italy joined a year later). War was launched against China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of July 7, 1937 in which a clash near Beijing between Chinese and Japanese troops quickly escalated into the full-scale warfare of the Second Sino-Japanese War, followed by the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and the Pacific War.\n\nDespite the military's long tradition of independence from civilian control, its efforts at staging a coup d'état to overthrow the civilian government, and its forcing Japan into war through insubordination and military adventurism, the military was ultimately unable to force a military dictatorship on Japan.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, the Japanese government was streamlined to meet war-time conditions and under the National Mobilization Law was given absolute power over the nation's assets. In 1940, all political parties were ordered to dissolve into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, forming a one-party state based on totalitarian values. Even so, there was much entrenched opposition from the government bureaucrats, and in the 1942 general election for the Japanese Diet, the military was still unable to do away with the last vestiges of party politics. This was partly due to the fact that the military itself was not a monolithic structure, but was rent internally with its own political factions. Even Japan's wartime Prime Minister, Hideki Tōjō, had difficulty controlling portions of his own military.\n\nJapan's overseas possessions, greatly extended as a result of early successes in the Pacific War were organized into a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which was to have integrated Asia politically and economically—under Japanese leadership—against Western domination.\n\nMilitarism was even reflected in the clothing trends of the 1930s. Male kimono designs adopted explicitly militaristic imagery, including soldiers, bombers and tanks. These designs were not on public display but on linings and undergarments. They symbolisedor in the case of boy's clothes, were hoped to bring aboutthe alignment of the individual's goals with those of Japan as a whole.\n\nDespite the apparently monolithic national consensus on the official aggressive policies pursued by the Imperial government in the first part of the Shōwa era, some substantial opposition did exist. This was one of various forms of Japanese dissidence during the Shōwa period.\n\nThe most organized open opposition to militarism was from the Japanese Communist Party. In the early 1930s Communist activists attempted to influence army conscripts, but the party was suppressed during the mid-1930s within Japan.\n\nPersonal opposition included individuals from the fields of party politics, business and culture. Some notable examples include:\n\n\nThe surprise attack on Pearl Harbor happened on December 7, 1941. Multiple events led to the attack, such as the Japanese peoples' opposition to Westernism and the breaking off of negotiations between Japan and the United States. Japan had plans to take over other Asian countries, which resulted in the US to strip any war materials and resources to be sold to the Japanese and froze all assets and bank accounts in the US. The US fleet moved from being stationed in California to be moved in Pearl Harbor to somewhat control Japan's aggression and imposed on an embargo of essential materials, because Japan was trying to take over and control more territories.\n\nDespite efforts to totally militarize Japanese society during the war, including such measures as the National Service Draft Ordinance and the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, Japanese militarism was discredited by the failure of Japan's military in World War II and by the American occupation. After the surrender of Japan, many of its former military leaders were tried for war crimes before the Tokyo tribunal. Furthermore, its government and educational system were revised and pacifism was written into the post-war Constitution of Japan as one of its key tenets.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1952032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952032", "title": "David Einhorn (rabbi)", "text": "David Einhorn (rabbi)\n\nDavid Einhorn (November 10, 1809November 2, 1879) was a German rabbi and leader of Reform Judaism in the United States. Einhorn was chosen in 1855 as the first rabbi of the Har Sinai Congregation in Baltimore, the oldest congregation in the United States that has been affiliated with the Reform movement since its inception. While there, he created an early American prayer book for the congregation that became one of the progenitors of the 1894 \"Union Prayer Book\". In 1861, Einhorn was forced to flee to Philadelphia, where he became rabbi of Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel. He moved to New York City in 1866, where he became rabbi of Congregation Adath Israel.\n\nHe was born in Diespeck, Kingdom of Bavaria, on November 10, 1809, to Maier and Karoline Einhorn. He was educated at the rabbinical school of Fürth, where he earned his rabbinical ordination at age 17. He then studied at the universities of Erlangen, Munich and Würzburg, where he studied from 1828 to 1834, supported by his mother following the death of his father.\n\nHe was a supporter of the principles of Abraham Geiger, and while still in Germany advocated the introduction of prayers in the vernacular German, the exclusion of messianistic hopes and the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the sacrificial services there from the synagogue service, and other ritual modifications, lobbying on behalf of these changes at the 1844 Frankfurt Assembly. He was chosen Landesrabbiner of the Birkenfeld at Hoppstädten, and afterward Landesrabbiner of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1847, succeeding Rabbi Samuel Holdheim, whose views were a major influence on Einhorn. An incident in which he blessed an uncircumcised boy, which upset many of his more traditional congregants, led to his departure from Germany. He was called to Pest, Hungary, in 1851, where his views met with such opposition that the Emperor of Austria ordered his temple closed only two months after his arrival. The Emperor saw a connection between the Jewish reform movement and the Revolutions of 1848.\n\nEinhorn emigrated to the United States and was named on September 29, 1855, as the first rabbi of the Har Sinai Congregation in Baltimore. In that role, Einhorn formulated the \"Olat Tamid\" siddur for use in services, which became one of the models for the \"Union Prayer Book\" published in 1894 by the Central Conference of American Rabbis. \"Olat Tamid\" contrasted with Isaac Mayer Wise's \"Minhag America\" in particular by removing references to the status of Jews as a chosen people and eliminating references to the restoration of sacrificial services in the Temple.\n\nEinhorn was an opponent of the Cleveland Conference of 1855 and its decision that the Talmud had primacy in interpreting the Torah. In this stand, Einhorn stood in contrast to Rabbi Wise's efforts to find language that could accommodate the various strands of Judaism in the United States, arguing that such efforts betrayed the progress of reform. In 1856, he started publishing a German-language monthly magazine, \"Sinai\", devoted to radical Jewish reform, which he also used as a platform for his antislavery pronouncements. Einhorn remained an opponent of interfaith marriage, arguing in \"Sinai\" that such practices were \"a nail in the coffin of the small Jewish race\", though he opposed the retention of practices such as the wearing of phylacteries, the limitations on activity prohibited on Shabbat, and kosher dietary laws, all of which he viewed as outmoded. Only those portions of the Torah that derived from a moral foundation were to be retained. He became the acknowledged leader of Reform Judaism in America, and in 1858 he published a revised prayer book, which formed the model for later revisions.\n\nIn 1861, Einhorn delivered a sermon as a response to a sermon by Morris Jacob Raphall that supported the existence of slavery, which Einhorn called a \"deplorable farce\" and argued that the institution of slavery in the South was inconsistent with Jewish values. He noted that the Jewish experience as slaves in Egypt as a reason that Jews should be more sensitive to the plight of slaves. He staunchly advocated this position, despite the fact that many of his congregants and colleagues were sympathetic to slavery in what was then a slave state, Maryland. In his sermon titled \"War on Amalek\", based on Exodus 17, Einhorn stated that \"We are told that this crime [slavery] rests upon a historical right! ... Slavery is an institution sanctioned by the Bible, hence war against it is war against, and not for, God! It has ever been a strategy of the advocate of a bad cause to take refuge from the spirit of the Bible to its letter.\" A riot broke out in response to his sermon on April 19, 1861, in which the mob sought to tar and feather the rabbi. Einhorn fled to Philadelphia where he became spiritual leader of Congregation Keneseth Israel.\n\nIn 1866 he moved to New York City, where he became the inaugural rabbi of Congregation Adas Jeshurun on 39th Street, which merged with Congregation Ansche Chesed in 1873, adopted the new name Congregation Beth-El, and built a new structure on 63rd Street. Einhorn retained the position as spiritual leader of the merged synagogue, delivering his final sermon on July 12, 1879, after which the congregation agreed to bestow upon him a pension of $3,500. Upon his retirement, Einhorn was recognized across denominations by his fellow rabbis; at a farewell ceremony held at his apartment (at his request, because of his health) he was presented with a resolution adopted at the convention of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, that recognized Einhorn for his rabbinic service, noting the \"ability and character which have marked his career, and the earnestness, honesty and zeal which have animated the heart of a man whom we proudly recognize as one of Israel's purest champions and noblest teachers.\" He died 4 months later.\n\nEinhorn died of old age on November 2, 1879, at his home on East 64th Street. He was 69, and had become increasingly feeble and unable to leave his room. His funeral was held before a packed house at Beth-El on November 6, 1879, where his plain coffin was carried into the synagogue by 12 pallbearers and placed before the pulpit. Attending were such rabbinic notables as Richard James Horatio Gottheil of Congregation Emanu-El, Einhorn's son-in-law and successor Kaufmann Kohler of Beth-El, another son-in-law, Emil G. Hirsch, of Louisville, Kentucky, along with representatives of the congregations he served in Baltimore and Philadelphia. He was buried at Machpelah Cemetery, near the Jackie Robinson Parkway.\n\n"}

Serious theatrical pieces can use puppets, either for aesthetic reasons, or to achieve special effects that would not otherwise be possible with human actors. In parts of the world where puppet shows have traditionally been children's entertainment, many find the notion of puppets in decidedly adult situations—for example, involving drugs, sex, or violence—to be humorous, because of the bizarre contrast it creates between subject matter and characters.\n\nAdult puppeteering appears in many forms. In the US and UK it is more easily found on screen. Television satire such as the UK's \"Spitting Image\" provides a strong link to the earlier traditions of Punch and Judy or Commedia dell'Arte as sources of social and political commentary. Puppetry sitcoms such as the US series \"Dinosaurs\" feature puppet characters who are entertaining in themselves, not as satirical figures. Adult puppet theatre has a strong tradition in Asia and parts of Europe, and has a smaller presence in Australia, the UK and the US. Handspan Theatre from Melbourne, Australia, toured internationally with its innovative and often surreal adult productions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the gang became part of the Chicago Outfit under Al Capone.\n\nOriginally established as an athletic club, the Ragen's Athletic and Benevolent Association was soon led by team pitcher Frank Ragen. He hired out members of the club to Chicago Democrat politicians to do various forms of election fraud. Due to the gang's activities and increased votes by recent immigrants, the Democratic Party soon gained control over the Chicago City Council and Illinois legislature.\n\nThe gang quickly expanded, numbering 160 members by 1902 and 2,000 by 1908. It earned the motto \"\"Hit Me and You Hit 2,000\"\". By the end of the decade, the gang had financed careers of hundreds of Chicago city officials, including prominent aldermen, police chiefs, and city treasurers, as well as Ragen himself. Ragen became Chicago police commissioner. By 1920, many members of the gang had become notorious criminals and gunmen, such as William \"Gunner\" McPadden, Harry Madigan, Joseph \"Dynamite\" Brooks, Danny McFall, Hughey \"Stubby\" McGovern, Davy \"Yiddles\" Miller and Ralph Sheldon of the Sheldon Gang.\n\nThe years after World War I were a time of increased social tension, as returning veterans competed with more recent immigrants and newer African American migrants from the South for jobs and housing. In several cities, such tensions erupted in rioting, often instigated by one of slightly older, more established groups to restore dominance over a newer group, often a minority. The Irish and African Americans were both concentrated in housing on the South Side and in jobs at the stockyards located on that side of the city.\n\nThe Ragen gang were believed to instigate fights between black and other South Side neighborhoods that contributed to the Chicago Race Riot of 1919. In one instance, the Colts donned blackface and set fire to Lithuanian and Polish homes in the Back of the Yards neighborhood in a deliberate attempt to incite the immigrant community to join them in committing heinous acts against African Americans. The Ragen gang led raids from Irish neighborhoods into the Black Belt, where they looted homes and killed several people. Blacks retaliated by attacking other South Side neighborhoods. As news of the attacks spread, other neighborhoods around the city began rioting. Violence lasted four days and resulted in 38 deaths: 23 black and 15 white, and more than 1,000 injured.\n\nThe Ragen Colts also directed their anger at the Ku Klux Klan for its anti-Catholicism. In 1921, \"In September, 3,000 people from the stockyards district (of Chicago) watched as the Colts hanged in effigy \"a white-sheeted Klansman.\" (Tuttle)\n\nDuring Prohibition, the gang soon began bootlegging. Member Ralph Sheldon formed his own group and began hijacking rival liquor shipments. While the gang came into conflict with the Chicago Outfit during the bootleg wars, Capone, impressed with the gang, hired them as enforcers for the organization. The Irish Ragen gang were eventually absorbed into the organization following the establishment of the National Crime Syndicate in 1932. Many members would later become top leaders of the Chicago crime syndicate.\n\nIn 1920 several members of Ragen's Colts split off to form the NFL football team, the Chicago Maroons, later known as the Chicago Cardinals.\n\n\n"}

Pileus clouds are often short-lived, with the main cloud beneath them rising through convection to absorb them. They are formed by strong updraft at lower altitudes, acting upon moist air above, causing the air to cool to its dew point. As such, they are usually indicators of severe weather, and a pileus found atop a cumulus cloud often foreshadows transformation into a cumulonimbus cloud, as it indicates a strong updraft within the cloud.\n\nPilei can also form above mountains, ash clouds, and pyrocumulus clouds from erupting volcanoes.\n\nPilei form above some mushroom clouds of high-yield nuclear detonations.\n\nSometimes several pileus clouds are observed above each other. The bright iridescent colors seen in pileus are sunlight diffracted in water vapor. Iridescent colors are strongest when the diffracting droplets are small and similar in size. The newly formed pileus droplet all of similar provenance are ideal for iridescence.\n\nWhen sheet of altostratus cloud is seen lower down and skirting a cumulonimbus cloud, it is classified as a velum cloud.\n\nPilei clouds indicate the parent cloud is growing rapidly, has plenty of moisture, and is highly unstable.

There are currently four teams that reside in the division: the Buffalo Bills (based in Orchard Park, New York); the Miami Dolphins (based in Miami Gardens, Florida); the New England Patriots (based in Foxborough, Massachusetts); and the New York Jets (based in East Rutherford, New Jersey).\n\nBoth perfect regular seasons in professional football since the adoption of a 14-game schedule in the inaugural AFL season and by the NFL in 1961 have been achieved by teams in this division – the 1972 Dolphins, who completed the only perfect season in professional football at 17–0, and the 2007 Patriots, who reached 18–0 before losing Super Bowl XLII. Since the division's enfranchisement in 1960, with the creation of the American Football League, the division has been represented in twenty Super Bowls and won nine of them. The most recent appearance in the Super Bowl by an AFC East team was the Patriots victory in Super Bowl LIII.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Patriots had the most wins in the division's history, with a record of 500–392–9, with a playoff record of 35–19 (6–5 in Super Bowls) entering the playoffs of that season. The Dolphins were second at 446–350–4 (having played 84 fewer games than their division rivals) with a playoff record of 20–21 (2–3 in Super Bowls). The Bills were at 406–470–8 with a playoff record of 14–15 (with two American Football League titles) and 0–4 in four consecutive Super Bowls. The Jets held a record of 396–480–8, with a playoff record of 12–13 including a victory in Super Bowl III.\n\nIn 2012, the Patriots broke a tie with the Dolphins for winning the most division titles; with subsequent division titles in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 the Patriots have won 21 AFL/AFC East division titles to Miami's 14. The Bills have won ten division titles, and the Jets have won four. As of 2019, the last season which the Patriots did not win the AFC East was in 2008, when the Dolphins beat them in a tiebreaker.\n\nTwo teams formerly in the division combined for ten AFL/AFC East titles – the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans) won four division titles (and the 1960 and 1961 league titles) during the AFL era while the Baltimore–Indianapolis Colts won six division titles (and Super Bowl V) in the 32 seasons they were in the division.\n\nThe American Football League Eastern Division was formed during the inaugural season of the American Football League in 1960, as a counterpart to the AFL Western Division. The divisional alignment consisted of the Buffalo Bills, New England Patriots, New York Titans and Houston Oilers. The Miami Dolphins entered the AFL in 1966 as part of its Eastern division.\n\nThe division was absorbed nearly intact with the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, but Houston was moved to the AFC Central (formerly the NFL Century Division, now the AFC North) and replaced by the closer Baltimore Colts (from the NFL Coastal Division, which became the NFC West). Despite relocating to Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, the Colts continued to play in the AFC East until NFL expansion from 31 to 32 teams with the addition of the Houston Texans (successor club in Houston to the Oilers) and 2002 re-alignment when they were moved to the AFC South (the successor franchise to the Oilers, the Tennessee Titans, is also in the AFC South).\n\nAlthough Miami is farther south than the home cities of the other three teams, all of which are in the Northeast, all four AFC East teams have historical rivalries among them, dating from their years in the AFL during the 1960s. All four teams in this division are based in the Eastern Time Zone.\n\nNone of the AFC East teams currently play within the central city of their metropolitan area (in New England's case, they also reflect the region they are based in):\n\nAlmost analogously, three out of the four NFC East teams do not actually play within the city of their naming (only the Philadelphia Eagles do so).\n\nAll of the teams are or were coached by a first or second generation member of the Bill Parcells coaching tree: the Patriots have Bill Belichick; the Dolphins had Tony Sparano; the Jets had Eric Mangini (who served as an assistant with both Belichick and Parcells); and the Bills had Dick Jauron (fired on November 17, 2009), who served as an assistant with former Parcells assistant Tom Coughlin. The Jets were coached by Todd Bowles (2015-2018) and the Bills were coached by Rex Ryan for 31 games (the entire 2015-16 season, and he was fired before the last game of the 2016–17 season and replaced with interim Head Coach Anthony Lynn). Parcells himself coached the Patriots (1993–96) and the Jets (1997–99) and was Vice President of Football Operations for the Dolphins until the summer of 2010.\n\nESPN's Chris Berman often calls this division the \"AFC Adams\" due to its geographical similarity to the old Adams Division of the NHL, now succeeded by the Atlantic Division.\n\nAlong with the AFC (formerly AFL) West, the AFC East is the oldest NFL division in terms of creation date (1960).\n\n Place cursor over year for division champ or Super Bowl team.\n\n\n\n(AFC East records 1960–2019 seasons)<br>\nReflects Colts & Oilers results only while in the East Division.<br>\nIn the sortable table below, teams can be ordered by name, number of division wins, playoff berths, or titles.\n"}

The Cherry Blossom Society envisioned such a restoration.\n\nThe February 26 Incident was an attempt to bring it about, failing heavily because they were unable to secure the support of the Emperor.

{"id": "1952065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952065", "title": "AFC North", "text": "AFC North\n\nThe American Football Conference – Northern Division or AFC North is one of the four divisions of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The division was adopted after the restructuring of the 2002 NFL season, when the league realigned divisions after expanding to 32 teams. This is the only division in the NFL that no team has hosted a Super Bowl in their stadiums.\n\nThe AFC North currently has four members: Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers. The original four members of the AFC Central were the Browns, Bengals, Steelers and Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans).\n\nThe AFC North is the only division in the AFC that does not contain a charter team from the original American Football League. However, the Cincinnati Bengals were an AFL expansion team in the 1968 AFL season (the Steelers and Browns joined the AFC in 1970), although the Bengals joining the AFL was contingent on the team joining the NFL after the AFL–NFL merger was finalized in 1970, as Paul Brown was not a supporter of the AFL.\n\nThree of the teams have interlocked histories. Both the Bengals and the Browns were founded by Paul Brown, while the Ravens and the city of Cleveland have their own unique relationship. Only the Steelers, who are older than the original Browns, have no direct history involving Paul Brown.\n\nThe AFC Central division was formed when the Browns and Steelers moved to the AFC in 1970, joining the newly formed \"AFC Central\" with the Houston Oilers (from the AFL's East Division) and Cincinnati Bengals (from the AFL's West Division).\n\nAlthough the Bengals won the first AFC Central Division Championship in 1970, the Steelers dominated the division for most of the 1970s. The Steelers also would win four Super Bowls in the decade, which were also the team's first league titles.\n\nThe 1980 Cleveland Browns broke the Steelers' six-year run as division champions, but failed to advance past the divisional round of the playoffs, losing to the Oakland Raiders as a result of Red Right 88. The Bengals were the only team to represent the AFC Central in the Super Bowl during the decade, appearing in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. Both appearances resulted in close losses to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Steelers returned as the dominant team in the division in 1992. They won five divisional titles in six years, and played in Super Bowl XXX, in which they lost to the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nIn 1992, the Oilers were involved in one of the most famous playoff games in NFL history. In a game now known as The Comeback, the Oilers surrendered a 32-point lead to the Buffalo Bills and lost in overtime, 41–38. It is the largest deficit ever overcome in the history of the NFL.\n\nIn 1995, the Jacksonville Jaguars joined the league through expansion and were placed in the AFC Central. It was the first change to the structure of the division since its inception and added a second team to the division from the U.S. South. In 1996, in one of the most controversial decisions in American sports history, the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore and were rechristened as the Baltimore Ravens. Then in 1997, the Oilers moved to Tennessee but remained in the division (the team later was renamed the Titans in 1999). The makeup of the AFC Central changed once again in 1999 when the NFL \"reactivated\" the Cleveland Browns. The division had six teams for the 1999 to 2001 seasons, and was the only division to have that many teams in the post-merger era.\n\nAside from Pittsburgh's appearance in Super Bowl XXX, the only other appearance in the Super Bowl for the division in the decade was the Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV, who came up one yard short of the first Super Bowl to go into overtime. Along the way, the team got revenge on the Bills seven years after the Comeback in the Wild Card round by defeating the Bills 22–16 as a result of the Music City Miracle.\n\nThe decade began with the Ravens winning Super Bowl XXXV. The team's defense, led by linebacker Ray Lewis, was arguably one of the best defenses of all time.\n\nIn 2002, the NFL realigned into eight divisions of four teams. The Jaguars and Titans—the latter winning the AFC Central title in 2000—were both moved to the new AFC South, while the rest of the AFC Central remained intact and was renamed the AFC North. The Bengals, Browns, and Steelers were guaranteed to remain in a division together in any circumstance; this was part of the NFL's settlement with the city of Cleveland in the wake of the 1995 Cleveland Browns relocation controversy. The division, geographically-speaking, thus became the shortest driving distance between each team among the NFL's eight divisions, as three of the teams are located within close proximity of Interstate 70 (with the one city that is not, Cleveland, being two hours north of I-70), and the distance between Baltimore and Cincinnati (the two teams furthest away from each other) being only 526 miles apart. The Browns and Steelers, the two \"closest\" rivals, even ride a bus to their games instead of flying.\n\nSince realignment, the Steelers have won the division title seven times, and the Ravens and Bengals have each won four times. The Steelers have swept all divisional opponents twice, in 2002 and 2008 (going 7 for 7 both times, winning against the Browns in a and the Ravens in the ), and the Ravens and Bengals have swept all three divisional opponents once each, the Bengals in 2009 and Ravens in 2011.\n\nSince divisional realignment, the Steelers have made the playoffs ten times, the Ravens eight times, the Bengals seven times, and the Browns one time.\n\nIn 2005, although finishing second in the division to the Bengals, the Steelers became the first team in NFL history to enter the playoffs as a #6 seeded wild card team and win the Super Bowl.\n\nIn 2008, the Steelers became the first team to repeat as division champion since the division's realignment in 2002. The team went on to win Super Bowl XLIII that season, their second Super Bowl in four years and an NFL-record sixth overall.\n\nIn 2009, the Cincinnati Bengals swept their annual six-game slate of divisional opponents. Their first three games against the AFC North came in weeks three-through-five when they beat the Steelers, Browns and Ravens, respectively, each by three points. The close finishes deemed the Bengals, \"Cardiac Cats.\" Cincinnati clinched their first division title since '05 in a week 16 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, 17-10. In the playoffs, however, the Bengals fell to the New York Jets at home, 24-14.\n\nBaltimore finished off their season by winning three of their final four games to finish 9-7 and earn the number-six seed in the AFC Playoffs. In the first round of the postseason, Baltimore defeated the New England Patriots in Foxboro, 33-14. In the divisional round of the postseason, Baltimore's season came to an end with a 20-3 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, who would defeat the Jets one week later to win the conference.\n\nThe Ravens repeated as division champions in 2011 and 2012. The team went on to win Super Bowl XLVII over the San Francisco 49ers, on February 3, 2013, in New Orleans. It was the second franchise Super Bowl win. \nAs of 2012, the Steelers are the AFC North's most successful team with a 599–547–21 record all-time with the Browns 2nd in line with an overall record of 510–441–while the Ravens sit in 3rd (even though they were not an official franchise until 1996) at 164–128–and then the Bengals today remain the only team in the division with their all-time record below .500 as they sit in last at 310–396–.\n\nIn 2015, the Bengals became the first team in the AFC North (Central) to ever start the year 8–0, finishing the season 12–and winning the division for the second time in three years. Cincinnati clinched the division title in week 16 when the Steelers were upset by the 4–10 Ravens in Baltimore, quarterbacked by Ryan Mallett. Bengals' quarterback Andy Dalton was having his best season of his five-year career until breaking his thumb on December 13 against Pittsburgh caused him to miss the rest of the season. In the playoffs, Cincinnati (quarterbacked by AJ McCarron) lost in a rematch with the Steelers, 18–16, in the final minutes of a heated battle. Pittsburgh advanced to the Divisional Round of the playoffs, only to lose to Peyton Manning and the eventual Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Steelers won the division title in 2016 after a 31–27 win over the Ravens on Christmas Day.\n\nThe Ravens clinched the division in Week 15 of 2019 in a 42–21 win over the NY Jets.\n\n Place cursor over year for division champ or Super Bowl team.\n\n<nowiki>+</nowiki> A players' strike in 1982 reduced the regular season to nine games.

The division comprises the Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs, Las Vegas Raiders, and Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe division has sent teams to the Super Bowl sixteen times beginning with Super Bowl I vs. Green Bay. As of the 2019 season, the Broncos and Raiders were tied with the most Super Bowl wins within the division with 3 each; The Broncos have appeared in the most Super Bowls in the division with 8 and the Raiders have appeared in 5. The Chiefs are 2–1 in the Super Bowl, while the Chargers lost their lone Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXIX.\n\nThe division was formed in 1960 as the American Football League's Western Division. In 1970, as part of the new NFL's two-conference, six-division alignment, the AFL West entered the merged league more or less intact as the AFC West.\n\nThe original AFL West had four members – the Dallas Texans (who moved to Kansas City in 1963 as the Chiefs), Denver Broncos, Los Angeles Chargers (who moved to San Diego in 1961, then back to Los Angeles in 2017) and Oakland Raiders. These four teams have remained in the AFL/AFC West since its inception, and are currently the only teams in the division. Largely because of this, and the fact they have played each other twice a year for over half a century, the entire division is considered one very large and very heated rivalry.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals played the last two AFL seasons in the AFL West despite being further east than Houston, where the Houston Oilers played at the time and were members of the AFC East. The Bengals (along with the Oilers) moved to the AFC Central (formerly the NFL Century Division, now the AFC North) in 1970, instantly forming rivalries with the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nIn 1977, the Seattle Seahawks were added to the AFC West after spending their expansion season in the NFC West; they would move back to the NFC West in 2002. The first-year Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976 played as a member of the AFC West before being aligned into the NFC Central in 1977.\n\nEach of the four AFC West teams won a division title in the first four years of the realignment – Oakland in 2002, Kansas City in 2003, San Diego in 2004 and Denver in 2005. It is the only one of the eight NFL divisions to have all of its teams win titles in the first four seasons of the North-East-West-South format.\n\nIn the early and mid-2000s, the division was often cited as one of the NFL's \"Toughest Divisions\" due partially to the home-field advantages of Empower Field at Mile High, Arrowhead Stadium, Qualcomm Stadium and the Oakland Coliseum, although in 2008 the division was the NFL's weakest since the AFC Central in 1985 by sending the San Diego Chargers to the playoffs as division winners with an 8–8 record while the New England Patriots missed out at 11–5 after losing out on tiebreakers for both the AFC East and the wild-card. In 2010, the Raiders swept the entire division, going 6-0, but failed to qualify for the playoffs as they only won two non-divisional games.\n\nThe division was very weak in 2011 as well, when a loss by the Raiders in the last game of the season gave the Broncos the division title with only an 8-8 record. Only the NFC West in 2010 and the NFC South in 2014 have historically sent a worse division winner to the playoffs, when the Seahawks (themselves a former AFC West member) won that division with a 7-9 record and the Panthers won the NFC South division with a 7–8–1 record.

It was created before the 2002 season when the league realigned divisions after expanding to 32 teams. Since its creation, the division has had the same four members: Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Tennessee Titans.\n\nBefore the 2002 season, the Texans did not exist, the Colts belonged to the AFC East, and the Titans and Jaguars were members of the AFC Central. The AFC South is often regarded as the NFL's \"newest\" division since at the time of its establishment none of the new division's members had played more than eighteen seasons in their current cities. The Colts had played in Baltimore until the end of the 1983 season, the Jaguars commenced play in 1995 and the Titans had been based in Houston (where they were known as the Oilers) until 1996. However, Indianapolis, Tennessee and Jacksonville had all won multiple division titles and wild card berths in their prior respective divisions.\n\nEntering 2016, the Colts hold a 494–433–7 record and a 22–23 playoff record with two NFL league crowns, four Super Bowl appearances and two wins. The Titans hold a record of 404–442–6 with a playoff record of 14–19, including two AFL championships (as the Houston Oilers) and the loss in Super Bowl XXXIV. The Jaguars hold a 152–184 record and a 5–6 playoff record. The Texans made the playoffs for the first time in their ten-season existence in 2011 and hold a 97–127 record and a 2–3 playoff record.\n\nThe Colts' Super Bowl XLI victory in 2006 is the only Super Bowl win from the AFC South to date, and the division owns the longest active Super Bowl victory drought. The next thirteen Super Bowls were won by at least one team in the other seven divisions, including seven victories from seven divisions from 2009 to 2015.\n\nWhen the NFL realigned for the 2002 schedule, the newly created AFC South was formed from two former AFC Central teams, an AFC East team, and an expansion team. Its inaugural season was won by the Tennessee Titans who went on to play in the AFC Championship game. For the next five years, the Indianapolis Colts won the division including their victory in Super Bowl XLI. In 2007, the AFC South had the best division record of all time based on the combined 42–22 (.656 winning percentage). The record was previously held by the 1975 AFC Central's .643 winning percentage. In 2008, the Tennessee Titans won the division, ending Indianapolis' five-year streak of division titles. However, in 2009, the Colts would storm back to win their 6th division championship in Week 12 of the season with a win over the Houston Texans and a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn 2010, the Indianapolis Colts again won their division by winning their final four games, including a victory over the Jaguars that tied the records of the two teams. The Colts controlled their own destiny, with the Jacksonville Jaguars losing its last three games of the season. In 2011, the Houston Texans won their first AFC South title, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In Week 14, Houston had to beat Cincinnati and New Orleans had to beat the Tennessee Titans to secure the playoffs for Houston. Houston won 20–19 and New Orleans won 22–17 against the Titans, giving Houston its first ever playoff spot. The Texans had won their first Playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 but then lost to the Baltimore Ravens 20–13 in the Divisional game. The Texans repeated as AFC South champions in 2012 as well after beating Indianapolis 29–17 in Week 15 that season. In the playoffs, the Texans beat the Bengals once again, 19–13, but lost to the New England Patriots 41–28 during the Divisional Weekend. The Colts would retake the AFC South division crown in 2013. Indianapolis swept all three of its divisional opponents during the 2013 campaign to reclaim its first division title since 2010. Again in 2014, the Colts claimed the division title by defeating the Texans in a week 15 matchup, 17–10. The Texans took over as AFC South champions in 2015 following their 30–6 win over Jacksonville in week 16. Houston repeated as division champions in 2016; despite finishing with matching 9–7 records along with Tennessee, the Texans earned the AFC South's automatic berth into the NFL playoffs based on finishing better against the division (5–1) than the Titans (2–4). In 2017, the Jaguars won their first AFC South title after a Titans loss to the Rams in Week 16. In the previous week, the Jaguars had clinched their first playoff berth since 2007, with a win against the Texans. The Texans reclaimed the division crown with an 11–5 record in 2018, though the Colts also made the playoffs as a wild card and defeated the Texans in Houston in the first round by a score of 21–7. In 2019, the Texans won their sixth division title with a 10-6 record, and the Titans reached the Wildcard with 9-7. The Texans would win in the Wildcard vs. the Buffalo Bills and make it to the Divisional Round, losing 51-31 to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Titans, however, would make it to the AFC Championship, also losing 35-24 to the Chiefs.\n\n \n\n Team earned first-round bye.<br>\nStats updated through the 2018 Season\n"}
{"id": "1952092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952092", "title": "NFC East", "text": "NFC East\n\nThe National Football Conference – Eastern Division or NFC East is one of the four divisions of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). It currently has four members: the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Washington Redskins. \n\nThe division was formed in 1967 as the National Football League Capitol Division, keeping with the theme of having all of the league's divisions starting with the letter \"C.\" The division was so named because it was centered on the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. In 1967 and 1969 the teams in the NFL Capitol Division were Dallas, Philadelphia, Washington and the expansion team New Orleans Saints, which had been replaced by the New York Giants for the 1968 season. As of 2019, the NFC East is the only division in the league in which all four current teams have at least one Super Bowl win.\n\nThe NFC East has a long history of being geographically inaccurate. While the New York Giants, Philadelphia, and Washington are based on the East Coast, Dallas and St. Louis (later Phoenix, then Arizona) remained a part of the East from the 1970 merger until 2002 despite being geographically west of most teams in the conference.\n\nTo begin with, the Cowboys were only located east of two NFC teams that were outside of the East division (Rams and 49ers from the West division) while the Cardinals were east of one additional such team (Vikings from the Central division). The Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the Central as an expansion team in 1976; they’re located east of Dallas and St. Louis. The Cardinals relocated to Phoenix to start the season and stayed in the East through ; that made them located west of every team in the NFC except for the Rams and 49ers. The Rams relocated from Los Angeles to St. Louis to start the season and stayed in the West, while the Carolina Panthers joined the West as an expansion team that same season; this made the Cardinals and Cowboys west of every team in the conference except for the 49ers from 1995–2001.\n\nThe NFC East teams have combined to be the most successful division in the NFL since the 1970 NFL merger with 21 NFC Championship wins and 13 Super Bowl victories, the highest marks of any division in the NFL. The division features a number of prominent rivalries such as the Cowboys–Redskins rivalry and Eagles–Giants rivalry. Because the division's teams are in some of the United States' largest media markets (New York No. 1, Philadelphia, No. 4, Dallas-Fort Worth No. 5, and Washington No. 7), the NFC East receives a high amount of coverage from national sports media outlets. In the early 1990s the division claimed four consecutive Super Bowl champions, all 4 against the Buffalo Bills, with the Giants and Redskins respectively winning back-to-back in Super Bowls XXV and XXVI; and the Cowboys winning twice after in Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII. Those same three teams won seven out of ten Super Bowls, from 1986-87 to 1995-96 (the 49ers won the other three during that span) The Eagles are the most recent team in the division to win a Super Bowl, Beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. The NFC East was the first division since the 2002 realignment to send 3 teams to the playoffs when the 2006-07 NFL playoffs had Philadelphia winning the division and Dallas and New York taking both wildcard spots.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are the only NFC East team to actually play in the city of the team's naming, Philadelphia. The other three teams play in suburbs of the major cities they are named after. The Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington, Texas, and is the only team in this division that is not based in the Eastern Time Zone (the Cowboys are based in the Central Time Zone). The Washington Redskins play in Landover, Maryland and the New York Giants play in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where they share a stadium with the New York Jets. Analogously, three of the four AFC East teams do not actually play within the city of their naming (The Patriots geographical identifier is New England, being named for the region the team plays for).\n\nThe NFC East can also be called the most valuable NFL division. All four teams in the division are in the top ten of most valuable NFL franchises (Cowboys #1; Giants #3; Redskins #5; Eagles #10). The next closest division is the AFC North, which is not completed until the 26th ranked Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nPlace cursor over year for division champ or Super Bowl team.\n\nThere was one division sweep of the Capitol Division, 1969 Cowboys 6-0\n\n\nAll four teams in the NFC East have won the Super Bowl. The Cowboys lead with five, followed by the Giants with four, the Redskins with three, and the Eagles with one. In overall NFL history, however, the Giants lead with eight league championships, followed by the Redskins and Cowboys with five each, then the Eagles with four.\n\nThere have been two division sweeps of the NFC East Division, the 1998 Dallas Cowboys (8–0) and the 2004 Philadelphia Eagles (6–0).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1952105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952105", "title": "Deep Note", "text": "Deep Note\n\nThe Deep Note is THX's sound trademark, a distinctive synthesized crescendo that glissandos from a relatively narrow frequency spread (about 200–400 Hz) to a broader frequency spread (of about three octaves). It was created by James A. Moorer, a former employee of Lucasfilm's Computer Division in late 1982. The sound is used on trailers for THX-certified movie theaters, home video releases, video games, and in-car entertainment systems.\n\nThe Deep Note debuted at the premiere of \"\" in Los Angeles.\n\nThe U.S. trademark registration for the first version of the sound contains this description of it: \n\nThe first version of the Deep Note called \"Wings\" made its debut before the second THX trailer, \"Broadway\", that preceded the premiere showing of \"\" on May 25, 1983. Two different interpretations of the note ran concurrently with the 1983 version in both the \"Grand\" trailer and the mid-90s reorchestration of the \"Cimarron\" trailer, composed and conducted by the late James Horner. The original Cimarron trailer debuted in May 1988, with the release of Ron Howard’s \"Willow.\" The original sound mix of the Cimarron trailer was recalled in 1992, due to complaints from cinema projectionists, by claiming it “blew up cinema speakers,” which led to the use of the more common symphonic mix by James Horner. Users on YouTube found portions of the original mix, when a user found a bootlegged micro-cassette recording of the original mix of the trailer. The original trailer has yet to be found in high quality. The Deep Note originally transitioned from a soft to loud intensity, and over the years has been remixed digitally, as new technology developed.\nIn 1992, the Deep Note was registered as a trademark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nIn 1993, the Deep Note was cut short and pitched higher (ending in an E chord rather than a D), to save time for Laserdisc and again in 1995 for VHS. The next trailer, entitled \"Grand\", premiered during the theatrical release of Steven Spielberg's \"Jurassic Park\" on June 11, 1993. That logo consists of a \"Star Wars\"-esque laser beam cutting to a foggy crimson red background illuminating the screen accompanying with high pitch squealing noises for a few seconds before the corporate logo moves upward in a 90-degree angle in the center of the screen. This trailer, according to The THX Ultimate Demo Disc, was designed by Industrial Light & Magic and sound designed by David Slusser and Marco d'Ambrosio of Skywalker Sound. On July 3, 1996, \"Tex\" debuted with the theatrical release of \"Independence Day\". The Deep Note was low-pitched and cut short which is different than other versions. It was later used in the DVD version of the digitally mastered variant of the iconic \"Broadway\" trailer in 1997, then later with both the \"Ziegfeld\" and \"Tex Action\" trailers in 2006. 2001 would be the year when the \"Cavalcade\" trailer unveiled to theaters and home media releases based on the trailer seen on the 2000 Ultimate Edition DVD release of the 1991 film \"\"; as seen in prints of many movies. Both that logo and the 2007 \"Amazing Life\" trailer had the Deep Note been cut short to the single note (where both sounds stay in one pitch), in favor of other sound effects, Performed by Lost in the Sky. However, in the last mentioned trailers to use the 1983 note, both based on the famous \"Broadway\" trailer, the sound was played in full.\n\nThe sound is perceived as louder than it actually is; sound designer Gary Rydstrom explains that, \"from a technical standpoint, 'Deep Note' just feels loud because it has a spectrum of frequencies that grows from small to large.\"\n\nJames A. Moorer said in a 2005 interview, \"I like to say that the THX sound is the most widely recognized piece of computer-generated music in the world. This may or may not be true, but it sounds cool!\"\n\nAlthough Moorer had initially claimed that the score consisted of about 20,000 lines of code, he subsequently corrected the statement and elaborated:\n\nIn 2005, THX introduced \"The\" \"Science of Sensation\" trailer, which featured a brand new Deep Note, that sounds similar to the original, although various new voices were overlaid and some voices reach their final pitches before others. This version would be used on all new trailers, except for the \"Eclipse\" trailer.\n\nIn April 2015, THX introduced a new trailer named \"Eclipse\", which is accompanied by an updated, more powerful version of the Deep Note, also created by Moorer. It is described as being \"intensely more complex, taking the audience on an epic sensory journey unlike anything they've experienced before.\" This version of the Deep Note was created entirely digitally so it could play on Dolby Digital 7.1 and Dolby Atmos systems, and Moorer created 30-second, 45-second, and 60-second versions of it. Moorer used around eighty voices in the remake, as opposed to thirty in the original 1983 version. In an interview with Yahoo!, Moorer said \"I kept thinking: That’s the way I wanted it to sound originally. I think it’s as far as you can take it.\"\n\nPrior to the creation of the Deep Note, several other works made use of similar techniques of frequency spread. A recognized predecessor is a section in the Beatles' 1967 song \"A Day in the Life\", using a full orchestra. Unlike in the Deep Note, the resolving high chord is never held, but instead brought to a stop. Moorer has admitted that both \"A Day in the Life\" and a fugue in B minor by Bach were sources of inspiration for the Deep Note.\n\nIn their book \"Analog Days\", Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco say that the track \"Spaced\", from the 1970 Beaver & Krause album \"In a Wild Sanctuary\", was \"copied by a famous Marin County film company\" to introduce its film presentations, although they do not identify the company. The authors quote synthesizer builder Tom Oberheim as saying that the original analog form is much richer than the \"digital perfection\" evident in the sound logo so familiar to cinema-goers.\n\nThe 1979 film When a Stranger Calls contains an approximate version of the Deep Note near the 12:30 mark of the film.\n\nFor its 35th anniversary, THX Ltd. released an image of the original 30-voice score, with notes, on their official Facebook page.\n\nBritish rock band Asia's track \"Countdown To Zero\" begins with the Deep Note.\n\nIn 1992, The 1988 trailer, Cimarron was parodied in the Direct to Video animated film with the “THX” name spelled “THUD”, including the Lucasfilm Ltd. Sound System” byline also being misspelled to “Mucasfilm Ltd. Sound Systems” and the classic motto “The Audience is Listening” being spoofed “The Audience is Now Deaf”. This parody became an internet meme in the 2010s and is still considered one of the greatest logo parodies of all time.\n\nRapper Dr. Dre was sued in 2000 by Lucasfilm, then-owner of THX, for using an unauthorized cover of Deep Note in the opening track \"Lolo (Intro)\" on his 1999 album \"2001\".\n\nKABB-TV Channel 29 in San Antonio, Texas used the Deep Note on its station identification in 1987.\n\n"}
{"id": "1952113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952113", "title": "Stay Together (Suede song)", "text": "Stay Together (Suede song)\n\n\"Stay Together\" is a non-album single by Suede, released on 14 February 1994 on Nude Records. It is the last single released while guitarist Bernard Butler was in the band, though subsequent singles from \"Dog Man Star\" feature his music. It is tied with \"Trash\" as the highest charting single the band has released, reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart. The song also charted in Ireland, peaking at no. 18. The single was released in the US on 26 April as a six song EP, and was the first release by the band as The London Suede. The State-side name change was the result of a successful lawsuit brought by Suzanne deBronkart, who had already been performing and recording in the US under the name Suede.\n\nFollowing the death of Bernard Butler's father, relations within Suede started to deteriorate. Butler kept to himself on the following tour of the US, while the other band members indulged in some of the worst excesses of their career. Butler travelled to concerts by himself or on The Cranberries tour bus, rather than travel with his bandmates. This influence became prevalent as Butler later stated, \"Whatever I did on Stay Together was the A to Z of the emotions I was experiencing... defiance, loss, a final sigh.\" What was intended as a couple of days' recording stretched out to two weeks. It was later revealed that the song had almost 50 tracks of recorded material on it. According to an entry in Simon Gilbert's diary in the biography \"Love and Poison\", Butler objected to the lyrics in \"Stay Together\". The entry read: \"Lyrics not to be printed on cover of single in case his mother reads it. '16 tears', obviously paedophilic!.\"\n\nThe lyrics for \"The Living Dead\" were also criticised by Butler. At the time he said: \"I've written this really beautiful piece of music and it's a squalid song about junkies.\" It is known that throughout the decade after its release, the band have largely disowned the song. Anderson considers the single and accompanying video the worst the band has released, stating, \"I don't think the fuss about Stay Together was justified, I think that was just hype. [...] I just find it a bit bombastic. I don't think the lyrics are that good either. It's okay.\" However publicist Phill Savidge suggests that Anderson \"can't believe he wrote it about that girl, Anick\" (Brett's girlfriend at the time), which is why he has no feelings for it.\n\nThe promotional video for the song was filmed at Riverside Studios in London. The band's view of the video, directed by Jon Klein, is that it features too much empty symbolism. They feel that parts featuring Butler hanging upside down, playing his guitar, as well as Anderson gagged, are particularly misplaced considering the song's tone. During the video there are small clips of two jumpers about to fall from the roof of a tall building. There are also images of the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center in New York.\n\nSuede first premiered the song at a four-city French tour late 1993. There was a lot of press interviews at the time, with Brett Anderson appearing on the front cover of \"Vox\" and \"Sky\" magazines. While in Scotland, \"The List\" and \"The Scotsman\" wrote lengthy features and interviews with the band to promote the band's Edinburgh gig at the Queen's Hall. Suede secured two performances on \"Top of the Pops\". The first in the same program as Elastica, who made their TOTP debut with \"Line Up\", in which Suede mimed on a stage ringed by flaming torches. The second as a tribute to Derek Jarman, who died 21 February. To promote the single the band embarked on a three-date mini-tour of Worthing, Blackpool and Edinburgh. \"Stay Together\" was released in the UK 14 February 1994 on double gatefold vinyl, MC and CD. The single was available in four formats: 7\" single and cassette single featuring a \"Stay Together\" radio edit and \"The Living Dead\"; 12\" single featuring the long version of \"Stay Together\" and both b-sides; and CD single featuring all four versions. The 12\" single was issued in a limited edition (10,000) gatefold sleeve featuring a large band photo inside. The April issue of \"Select\" gave away a free cassette which included a piano version of \"The Living Dead\", recorded at Butler's flat on a 4-track. The single was released on Columbia Records ten weeks later in the US as a six-song EP 26 April 1994. The EP included the b-sides \"Dolly\" and \"High Rising\", released as part of previous UK single \"So Young\". The single charted at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. This was the band's highest charting single at the time, which was later matched by 1996 single \"Trash\". Although Anderson is very keen to downplay the success of the single, and considers the song as a rare moment in the band's career where \"hype dictated its success.\" The single did not chart in the US, although it is considered to be the closest the band came to having a hit-single there.\n\nThe single received largely positive response upon release and largely positive comments from musical critics. Jack Rabid of AllMusic described the chorus of \"Stay Together\" as the weakest of their singles up until that point. Though, he went on to say that a \"dramatic bridge punctuated by uncharacteristic background touches in the form of horns and cello make 'Stay Together' another fine outing.\" Lorraine Ali of the \"Los Angeles Times\" felt that the song was a step back from their work on the debut album. She wrote: \"On this six-song EP, the former Suede tones down the glammy decadence and dramatics that defined its 1993 debut and comes up far less alluring. The vocals still quaver a la Bowie, but now emit less emotion.\" J.D. Considine and Rob Sheffield focused more attention on the b-sides. Considine felt \"Dolly\" was the \"obvious rock hit\", while he said, \"High Rising,\" \"bring[s] out both the power of Brett Anderson's voice and the beauty of Bernard Butler's melodies.\" Sheffield rated the EP four stars out of five, and elaborated on one of Anderson's lyrics on \"The Living Dead\", where he sings \"I was the wife of an acrobat.\" Sheffield said: \"It's one of the many Suede moments that feels like heaven for cultists, hell for everybody else.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Caroline Sullivan spoke favourably of Suede's new musical direction, saying that \"Suede prematurely reach the eight-minute song stage of their career. But what could have been a pretentious misjudgement turns out to be one of their brightest moves.\" \"NME\" awarded it Single of the Week, writing: \"Luxuriating in the ambitious, dramatic, exhausting spell of this makes everything else sound like so much ephemera. Like most great things it leaves you utterly silent.\" Tom Doyle awarded the song \"Best New Single\" in the February 16 issue of \"Smash Hits\", calling it \"a rock ballad of epic proportions concerning itself with the wonders of love in the grim modern world of skyscrapers and motorway paths.\" He called it their \"best single yet\" and predicted it would be the band's first no. 1 single. \n\nIn the book \"The Last Party\", John Harris wrote: \"If its opulent packaging – like a double album, its vinyl version came in a gatefold sleeve – seemed designed to confirm that the group had left their indie peer group behind, the music it contained made the point explicit.\" He added: \"It split the critical fraternity in two: some were seduced by the sense that Suede had massively advanced their artistic boundaries; others believed, not entirely unreasonably, that they had teetered into absolute ludicrousness.\" In 2012, \"Stay Together\" was placed at number 3 on NME's \"100 Best Tracks of the Nineties\". In 2015 \"NME\" also included the single in their list of 50 must-have EPs, where \"Stay Together\" was ranked at number 25.\n\nThis was the last song ever played at a live gig with Butler, at the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh, on 12 February 1994. Although he and Anderson performed the B-sides, \"The Living Dead\" and \"My Dark Star\" on \"MTV's Most Wanted\" the following month. After its release, \"Stay Together\" was very rarely played live. It was played as the closing song to the ICA residency in 2003. B-side, \"The Living Dead\" has become a favourite live song over the years, including an appearance at Suede's Royal Albert Hall reunion gig. The Tears also performed the song at a gig at the Sheffield Leadmill in April 2005. Both b-sides were also played at the \"Dog Man Star\" night in March 2014. Suede played the full eight-minute version of \"Stay Together\" as the final encore of their Teenage Cancer Trust gig at The Royal Albert Hall, Sunday 30 March 2014, backed by a string and brass ensemble.\n\nAll songs written by Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nestled on ridge of rock overlooking the sea, it was considered a strategically important site in terms of communication with overseas areas and as an entranceway to the Sound of Mull. Mingary is roughly hexagonal in shape with nine-foot-thick walls, thicker on the seaward side. The remains of the castle are protected as a category A listed building.\n\nMingary Castle dates to either the thirteenth- or fourteenth century. It could have been originally constructed by either the MacDougalls or the MacDonalds of Ardnamurchan (also known as the MacIains of Ardnamurchan). King James IV of Scotland used it as a stronghold for fighting off Clan Donald in the late 15th century.\n\nIn 1515 the castle was besieged by the Clan MacDonald of Lochalsh and again two years later when they finally took the castle. In 1588 the chief of the MacLeans of Duart resided there after capturing the chief of the MacDonalds of Ardnamurchan. In 1588, one of the ships of the Spanish Armada, named the \"San Juan de Sicilia\", landed on Mull and MacLean of Duart used troops from the ship to aid him in his warring against the MacDonalds of Clanranald and the MacIans of Ardnamurchan. On one occasion, a force from the ship besieged to the castle for three days before withdrawing.\n\nOther occupants over the years included the Clan Campbell, the Earls of Argyll (in 1612), and Alasdair mac Colla who fought the English Parliamentarians of Oliver Cromwell in 1644.\n\nIn 2006 a Channel 4 television programme \"Wreck Detectives\" set out to uncover a shipwreck in the Sound of Mull, directly below the castle. The wreck was finally dated to 1644. In 2013 the site was designated as a Historic Marine Protected Area.\n\nA recent survey showed that the main curtain wall on the sea side is in imminent danger of collapse. Work will shortly commence to stabilise the wall by underpinning it before proceeding to preserve and restore the castle, after important preliminary archaeological work has been completed. All work is being undertaken by the Mingary Castle Preservation and Restoration Trust, a registered charity in Scotland. Detailed commentary on progress and emerging insights from the largely untouched archeology will be provided.\n\n"}

Jefferson batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was best remembered as an inaugural member of the expansion Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nJefferson was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1968 Major League Baseball draft out of Carver High School in Midlothian, Virginia. He went 40–50 with a 3.71 earned run average over six seasons in the Orioles' farm system when he debuted with the club in . He pitched a ten-inning complete game in his major league debut on June 23. In the second game of a doubleheader with the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, he nearly pitched a five-hit shutout; Rico Petrocelli hit a solo home run to tie the score with two outs in the ninth inning. The Orioles responded with a run in the top of the tenth inning to earn Jefferson the win.\n\nJefferson's rookie season was his only winning season, as he went 6–5 with a 4.11 ERA as a spot starter and middle inning relief pitcher. The Orioles captured the American League East crown, and manager Earl Weaver had Jefferson slated to be his long reliever in the post season, but he did not make an appearance in the 1973 American League Championship Series with the Oakland Athletics. Jefferson moved into the bullpen in , making just two spot starts, both against the Red Sox.\n\nOn June 15, the last place Chicago White Sox made a flurry of deals. They acquired left hander Dave Hamilton and minor league prospect Chet Lemon from the Oakland A's for Stan Bahnsen and Skip Pitlock, and acquired Jefferson from the Orioles for Tony Muser. With the Chisox, Jefferson was moved back into the starting rotation, compiling a 5–9 record with a 5.10 ERA. He split the between starts and the bullpen before he was lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft.\n\nJefferson set many career highs with the Blue Jays in . His 33 starts and 217 innings pitched were by far his best. Despite setting a Blue Jay franchise record with nine walks in a game against Baltimore on June 18, Jefferson's strikeout-to-walk ratio was also a career best 1.37 as he struck out 114 batters versus 83 walks.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable outing of Jefferson's career came on May 16, against eventual 22–game winner Mike Norris and the Oakland A's. Jefferson held the A's to just four hits over 11 innings while striking out ten. Norris was equally brilliant, but the Jays managed to squeak out a run in the bottom of the 11th to earn Jefferson the win.\n\nAfter that performance, Jefferson lost his next five decisions. He made his final appearance for Toronto on September 1, facing five batters and retiring just one while giving up three earned runs, allowing an inherited runner to score and committing an error. He was placed on waivers with a 4–13 record and 5.47 ERA.\n\nHe was selected off waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 11, and made just one appearance for the club, beating the Chicago Cubs.\n\nFollowing the season, he signed as a free agent with the California Angels. He started the season in the Angels' starting rotation, but after going 0–4 with a 4.68 ERA in his first five starts, was moved into the bullpen. He pitched far better in relief, going 2–0 with a 1.04 ERA in 21 appearances. He spent Spring training with the Orioles, but did not make the club.\n\nIn 2011, Jefferson died of prostate cancer.\n\n, or BaseballLibrary.com, or Retrosheet\n"}

It is within Kilcommon (Cill Chomáin) parish in the barony of Erris. Carrowteige is a relatively small townland with an acreage of just .\n\nCaochán, after whom the peninsula is named, was a legendary giant of Celtic sagas who had only one eye. His image was represented on the slopes of the hills overlooking Sruwaddacon Bay when the Tír Saile was created during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1841, a road was approved to run from Glenamoy to Carrowteige. In 1842 the drains for the road were partially opened, but by 1845 the road was still far from completed. Eventually in 1846, it was declared completed. There were no bridges on the road. At Muingnabo, the river bed was paved at a ford and remained that way until 1886 when the Annie Brady Bridge was erected. Annie Brady had been the wife of the Inspector of Fisheries for the area and had witnessed the difficulty in crossing the ford, and so raised money to build a bridge at the site. In 1933, a flood carried away the Annie Brady Bridge but it was later replaced.\n\nThroughout Erris until about 1900, the custom was 'in most cottages, the family lived and slept in one room using the others as store rooms. they knew no other kind of house life. In this one room the family retired to sleep, only partially undressed. Often the only furniture in the room was a chair, a couple of small wooden stools, with a cooking pot, a kettle and a tea pot and some cups'. The biggest industry was that of lace schools. The Department of Lands and Fisheries took over the lace schools from The Congested Districts Board about 1923 and formed Gaeltarra Éireann, a semi-state body, to manage them but the lace school in Carrowteige was closed in 1976.

The plot entails a story of corporate espionage conducted through an elaborate confidence game.\n\nIn 1999 the film was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for the Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay but lost out to Steven Soderbergh's \"Out of Sight\".\n\nCorporate engineer Joe Ross has invented a potentially lucrative financial process. While on a retreat on the island of St. Estèphe, he meets a wealthy stranger, Jimmy Dell, and attracts the interest of one of the company's new secretaries, Susan Ricci.\n\nJimmy wants to introduce Joe to his sister, an Olympic-class tennis player, in New York and asks him to deliver a package to her. Susan sits near Joe on the airplane back to New York, converses with him about how \"you never know who anybody is,\" and talks about unwitting drug mules. Suddenly afraid the package might contain something illegal, Joe opens it on the plane, but finds only a 1939 edition of the book \"Budge on Tennis\". Once home, Joe buys another copy of the book, to give to Jimmy's sister, and keeps the original at his office.\n\nJimmy suggests that Joe's boss, Mr. Klein, might not give him fair compensation for his work. Jimmy invites Joe to dinner, and seemingly on a lark opens a Swiss bank account for him with the token balance of 15 Swiss francs. Taking him to dinner at a club requiring membership, Jimmy has Joe sign a certificate to join. Over dinner, he advises Joe to consult legal counsel about his position in the company regarding the Process; Jimmy offers his own lawyer, telling Joe to bring the only copy of the Process to their meeting.\n\nJoe learns that Jimmy's sister does not actually exist, and that Jimmy is a con artist who is attempting to steal Joe's work. Joe contacts Pat McCune, a woman he met on the island who Susan told him was an FBI agent, and whose business card Susan kept. The police enlist him in a sting operation to catch Jimmy, but Jimmy never shows up for the planned meeting. Joe then learns that McCune is actually part of Jimmy's con game, and that his Process has been stolen.\n\nJoe attempts to explain what happened to his employer and the police, but finds that Jimmy has made it appear that he has sold his Process to the Japanese. The Swiss bank account that Jimmy opened for him makes it look as though he is hiding assets, and the certificate he signed to join the club turns out to be a request for political asylum in Venezuela, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. The police show Joe that Jimmy's apartment is a mere façade and that the club's members-only room was nothing but a restaurant. Joe is also framed for the murder of the company lawyer, George Lang.\n\nOn the run, Joe reconnects with Susan, who says she believes his story. Joe remembers that the hotel on the island maintains video surveillance, which could prove that Jimmy was there. Susan takes him to the airport in order to fly to the island. Seeing a police roadblock on the way to the airport, Susan convinces him to drive to Boston.\n\nAt the airport in Boston, Susan gives Joe a camera bag, which unbeknownst to him contains a gun, and an airplane ticket to the island. Before passing through security, Joe realizes that Jimmy left his fingerprints on the book Joe was to deliver. He leaves the airport with Susan, still not realizing that she is working against him. They purchase ferry tickets to return home. While Susan leaves to call Klein to inform him about the book, Joe attempts to board the ferry with the plane ticket only to find out the ticket destination is actually Venezuela. \n\nOn the ferry, Jimmy suddenly appears and Susan turns on Joe; the final step of this con is going to be Joe's death, made to appear as a suicide. As Jimmy reveals what he has done with The Process and turns his gun on Joe, he suddenly is hit with a tranquilizer dart shot by US Marshals who have been monitoring Jimmy for months, pretending to be tourists. They reveal that Mr. Klein was behind the entire con, because he wanted to keep all the profits for himself. Susan begs Joe for mercy, but he nonchalantly tells her that she is going to prison along with Jimmy.\n\nDavid Mamet is famous for his dialogues, which are characterized by incomplete sentences, foul language, stutters, and interruptions; it is known as \"Mamet-speak\".\n\nHere, Roger Ebert observes, \"His characters often speak as if they're wary of the world, afraid of being misquoted, reluctant to say what's on their minds: As a protective shield, they fall into precise legalisms, invoking old sayings as if they're magic charms. Often they punctuate their dialogue with four-letter words, but in \"The Spanish Prisoner\" there is not a single obscenity, and we picture Mamet with a proud grin on his face, collecting his very first PG rating\".\n\nAndrew Sarris, meanwhile, wrote, \"I liked \"The Spanish Prisoner\" because its very lightness in Mr. Mamet's mind as a minor genre entertainment enabled him to escape the pomposity and pretentiousness of recent Mamet movies and plays in which his cryptic phrases and ponderous pauses were supposed to suggest all sorts of psychic panic and moral havoc in a malignant society. By disdaining to look and sound like anything overly serious, Mr. Mamet's Pinteresque speech rhythms succeed as nothing since \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1984 on stage, 1992 on screen) in capturing something pervasively paranoid in contemporary life. ... To enjoy the twists and turns in Mr. Mamet's puzzle-like plot, one must remain detached from the nominal protagonist. This is accomplished by having the character share the faux-naïf speech rhythms and materialistic values of his employers and his business associates. ... Joe doesn't trust his boss, Klein (Ben Gazzara), who keeps reiterating that Joe has nothing to worry about, which in malicious Mamet-speak, means that Joe has a lot to worry about\".\n\nChris Grunden of \"Film Journal International\" adds, \"David Mamet's new film features the writer-director's trademark staccato dialogue, but, as in his earlier \"House of Games\", the film's stylized language (which can become wearying in some Mamet scripts) is matched with a confidence-scam plot that's almost dizzyingly complex, and is completely absorbing from start to finish\".\n\nRoger Ebert awarded the film 3½ stars out of 4, calling it \"delightful\" and comparing it to works of Alfred Hitchcock. James Berardinelli of \"Reelviews.net\", who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, also compared Mamet's script to Hitchcock's works, claiming that it \"supplies us with a seemingly-endless series of twists and turns, only a fraction of which are predictable\" as well as praising the actors by saying that \"nearly every major performance is impeccable\".\n\nChris Grunden of \"Film Journal International\" (comparing some points of the movie to \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\") wrote, \"Somewhere Alfred Hitchcock is smiling, for \"The Spanish Prisoner\" is the most deliciously labyrinthine homage to the master of suspense in recent years... Campbell Scott elicits just the right amount of youthful vanity, which gradually crumbles as he gets increasingly entrapped in the scheme to play him for a fool. Martin's supremely cool, calculatingly menacing turn as the enigmatic Jimmy Dell neatly contrasts Scott's golden-boy image. The strong supporting cast features fine work... Barbara Tulliver's editing is crisp - the pacing never flags for a moment - and Carter Burwell's score is fabulously moody and evocative\".\n\nReviewer Paul Tatara, on the other hand, criticized the film for using well-worn plot mechanisms, \"stiff characterizations and ridiculous line readings\".\n\n"}

About 50 people located on a farm owned by Isaac Morley had been baptized, but had not yet been instructed in relation to their duties under the collectivist arrangement. These people claimed that a spirit entered into them. Some claimed to see angels and other miraculous events were reported.\n\nUpon hearing of these events, Joseph Smith came to Kirtland to teach these Saints that they were in error and how to distinguish between what he described as true and false spiritual manifestations. Clark rejected Smith's message, and further claimed he received a revelation that he was to be a prophet.

Although the training there would probably be considered mediocre by modern standards, the school did have a microscope, an uncommon tool at the time. Knowledge of how to use this instrument proved to be useful in Mayo's future practice. It is a matter of debate whether Mayo actually graduated from the Indiana Medical College. William Mayo reportedly stated orally that he graduated from the Indiana Medical College. His graduation date from the Indiana Medical College has been reported as February 14, 1850. However, no documentation of his graduation exists and he is not listed in the Indiana Medical School list of graduates for that year. He then attended and graduated from the University of Missouri on February 28, 1854 with a degree in medicine.\n\nIn 1851, Mayo married Louise Abigail Wright (December 23, 1825 – July 15, 1915), and two years later, they had their first child, Gertrude. Around this time, Mayo left for a winter to work as an assistant at the University of Missouri's medical department. He returned in 1854, but contracted malaria and decided to leave the Lafayette area, saying, \"I'm going to keep on driving until I get well or die.\" Mayo found his way to Minnesota, which he thought would have a more healthful climate and where he did recover from malaria. He settled in Saint Paul, but returned to Indiana a short time later to bring his family to the Minnesota territory. Mayo then found his way to the present-day area of Duluth where he worked as a census-taker.\n\nHe brought his family to a village named Cronan's Precinct (near Le Sueur) along the Minnesota River where he became known as the \"Little Doctor\" because of his stature. Mayo tried his hand at a number of different activities including farming, operating a ferry service, and serving as a justice of the peace in addition to occasional medical duties. By this time, he had two more daughters in his family, Phoebe and Sarah.\n\nAfter a flood in 1859, the family moved to a home on Main Street in Le Sueur. There, he set up his first official medical practice, but the flow of patients was too meager to support the family. Mayo took to publishing a short-lived newspaper, the \"Le Sueur Courier\", which only lasted about three months. He also spent time working on a steamboat. The family saw its first male addition, William James Mayo, in 1861.\n\nAs the American Civil War began that same year, Mayo attempted to procure a commission as a military surgeon but was rejected. Nonetheless, he found his way into military medicine as the Dakota War of 1862 erupted in southwest Minnesota in late 1862. Organizing a group of people from Le Sueur and St. Peter, Mayo headed out to New Ulm, where some of the worst fighting had occurred. Makeshift hospitals in the city cared for people injured in the conflict, as well as refugees driven from farms in the area. His wife opened her home and a nearby barn to harbor eleven refugee families back in Le Sueur. In hopes of getting a body for dissection, Mayo, among other medical men, attended the hanging of 38 Native Americans in December 1862 for their role in the uprising. Mayo was given the body of Cut Nose whom he dissected in front of medical colleagues.\n\nOn April 24, 1863, Dr Mayo was named examining surgeon for the 1st Minnesota draft board headquartered in Rochester, Minnesota. He left his family for that position and soon found the new city to his liking, so they joined him there in early 1864. A year later, his son Charles Horace Mayo was born.\n\nDr. Mayo opened a solo medical practice in Rochester in 1863. He partnered with Dr. W. A. Hyde from February to June 1864 before going back to solo practice. In November 1867, Dr. Mayo entered into a partnership with pharmacist O. W. Anderson, which lasted until November 1869 when Dr. Mayo left heading for Pennsylvania and New York City to study surgical techniques. Dr. Mayo's first foray into politics was in 1872 when he made a speech to expose local corruption, which ended poorly and Dr Mayo left for St Paul. In 1874, Dr. Mayo returned to Rochester to rebuild his practice and re-entered local politics. Dr Mayo advocated for a municipal water supply and served on the local Health Board. In the 1880s, Dr Mayo was elected to city mayor, alderman, and was later a member of the school board. As Mayor, he oversaw the planning of the first City Hall. He served in the Minnesota State Senate from 1891 to 1895 and was a Democrat. By now, the number of patients was large enough to support the family with no need for him to assume additional jobs. In the 1890s, Dr Mayo advocated unsuccessfully to create an artificial lake by damming Bear Creek where it enters the Zumbro River.\n\nThe event that is usually credited with beginning the \"Mayo Clinic Story\" happened on August 21, 1883, when a tornado devastated Rochester. The most seriously wounded were tended at the German Library in Rommel's Hall with Dr. David Berkman as steward. Since many of the patients would need intensive care beyond what was being provided by the patient's relatives and friends, Dr. Mayo recruited the local Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota to be nurses. William J Mayo had just completed medical school, and Charles H Mayo was in his final year of school, so both were able to assist their father with care of the cyclone's victims. Mother Alfred Moes of the Sisters of St. Francis was convinced a full-fledged hospital was needed in Rochester and approached Dr W. W. Mayo to head it. She offered to raise the funds and supervise the construction of the hospital. Under her direction, St. Marys Hospital was built and opened in 1889. Originally, St Mary's Hospital had 12 beds, the three Mayo doctors as surgeons, and the Sisters of St Francis as staff.\n\nIn 1892, William Worrall Mayo asked Augustus Stinchfield to join his practice as a full partner. Once Stinchfield accepted the offer, W. W. Mayo promptly retired at age 73. As the practice grew, Christopher Graham, E. Starr Judd, Henry Stanley Plummer, Melvin Millet, and Donald Balfour were also invited to join it as partners. In 1919, the partners of the private practice created the Mayo Properties Association and established the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research as a not-for-profit entity.\n\nIn 1910, W. W. Mayo became interested in the extraction and distillation of alcohol from animal and vegetable wastes, and one day suffered a serious injury when the extraction mechanism crushed his arm and hand. That injury necessitated an amputation. Complications resulted in his death in March 1911, shortly before Mayo's 92nd birthday. His wife died in 1915. They are buried next to each other at Oakwood Cemetery in Rochester.\n\nThe family's home in Le Sueur was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Carson Nesbit Cosgrove and his family later lived in the home. Cosgrove went on to help create the Minnesota Valley Canning Company, later named Green Giant. Dr. W. W. Mayo's home in Rochester was razed to build the original Mayo Clinic building in 1914.\n\nW. W. Mayo is honored together with Charles Menninger and their sons with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on March 6.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1952226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952226", "title": "KTVU", "text": "KTVU\n\nKTVU, virtual channel 2 (UHF digital channel 31), is a Fox owned-and-operated television station licensed to Oakland, California, United States and serving the San Francisco Bay Area. The station is owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation, as part of a duopoly with San Jose-licensed independent station KICU-TV (channel 36). The two stations share studios at Jack London Square in Oakland; KTVU's transmitter is located at Sutro Tower in San Francisco.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on March 3, 1958, originally operating as an independent station. The station was originally owned by San Francisco-Oakland Television, Inc., a local firm whose principals were William D. Pabst and Ward D. Ingrim, former executives at the Don Lee Network and KFRC radio; and Edwin W. Pauley, a Bay Area businessman who had led a separate group which competed against Pabst and Ingrim for the station's construction permit. KTVU's operations were inaugurated with a special live telecast from its temporary studio facility at the former Paris Theatre in downtown Oakland. That June, the station moved into a permanent facility at Jack London Square in western Oakland, which was constructed using material gathered by the Port of Oakland and repurposed from a demolished pier.\n\nChannel 2 was the fourth commercial television station to sign on in the Bay Area, and the first independent station in the market. It was the second television outlet in Northern California to have been assigned the KTVU call letters, which were previously used by a short-lived station on UHF channel 36 in Stockton, which operated from September 1955 to April 30, 1956. During its first 15 years on the air, KTVU's transmitter facilities were originally based from a tower on San Bruno Mountain in northern San Mateo County. KTVU moved its transmitter facilities to the Sutro Tower, after the structure was completed in 1973.\n\nThe Ingrim–Pabst–Pauley group attempted to sell KTVU to NBC in 1960, as the network sought to acquire a television station in the Bay Area to operate alongside KNBC radio (now KNBR). The sale was eventually cancelled in October 1961, due to pre-existing concerns over the sale cited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that were related to NBC's ownership of radio and television stations in Philadelphia; as a result, the NBC affiliation in San Francisco stayed with KRON-TV until 2001, when NBC attempted again, successfully purchasing KNTV. Eighteen months after the sale to NBC was aborted, in July 1963 channel 2 was sold to the Miami Valley Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, for $12.3 million; the sale was finalized in mid-October of that year. Over the station's history as an independent, KTVU's programming schedule consisted mainly of syndicated off-network series, movies, talk shows and religious programs, as well as a sizeable amount of locally produced news, sports, talk and public affairs programming. In 1960, after acquiring camera, projection and slide equipment to transmit programming available in the format, the station began broadcasting its programming in color; much of the programs that it broadcast in color consisted of movies and certain series acquired from the syndication market that were produced in the format, as well as locally produced specials.\n\nUnder Cox's stewardship, channel 2 became the leading independent station in the San Francisco–Oakland market and one of the top-rated independents in the Western United States. KTVU retained this status even as competing independents on the UHF band signed on during the late 1960s, most notably KBHK-TV (channel 44, now KBCW) and KEMO-TV (channel 20, now KOFY-TV) within months of each other in early 1968.\n\nIn the early 1960s, KTVU obtained the local broadcast rights to the Warner Bros. Pictures library; the films it broadcast from the studio primarily consisted of those released during the 1950s, most being presented in color, which aired at 7:00 p.m. on Sundays. Channel 2 was the first television station in the Bay Area to air such films as \"A Star Is Born\", \"East of Eden\" and \"Rebel Without a Cause\". KTVU exercised discretion and limited the amount of commercial break interruptions during the movie telecasts, often airing the films uncensored and with commentary, either by a studio host or via slides. The station even televised the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film \"Hollywood Revue of 1929\" with some of the original two-strip Technicolor sequences. During the early 1970s, the station began employing a different programming strategy to stand out from the other independents in the market, acquiring first-run syndicated sitcoms and drama series, several comedies and dramas from the United Kingdom (such as \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" and \"The Benny Hill Show\", the latter of which had some episodes re-edited by the station to remove scenes of frontal nudity accidentally left in the broadcast prints), and various nature series (including \"National Geographic\" specials) as alternative offerings.\n\nAs an independent competitor, KTVU aired a nightly film showcase, \"The 8 O'Clock Movie\", as an alternative to network programs that aired during prime time on then-NBC affiliate KRON-TV (channel 4, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), CBS station KPIX (channel 5) and ABC-owned KGO-TV (channel 7). Continuing into its early years as a Fox affiliate, KTVU frequently aired classic movies (around 20 per week) in the 8:00 p.m. time slot as well as on Sunday afternoons. Many of the films presented were prints restored by the station's editing department to eliminate color and splicing errors, and scratches present within the negatives. It also occasionally aired movies originally assigned an R rating for their theatrical release (such as \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Walkabout\") without editing for strong profanity, nudity or violence, some of which aired during prime time. In 1992, KTVU ran a station-edited version of the 1984 science fiction film \"Dune\", which combined footage from the Alan Smithee television cut with the original theatrical release (thereby restoring all the violence featured in the latter cut, while eliminating some of the objectionable edits that caused director David Lynch to remove his name from the credits of the television print).\n\nChannel 2 adapted to competition over the years by reinventing the station's own image with the launch of a promotional campaign using the slogan, \"There's Only One 2\" – which was used in its marketing and on-air promos, including a musical jingle, during the 1970s and 1980s (the slogan was reintroduced under Fox ownership in 2015).\n\nIn 1977, KTVU was uplinked to satellite as a national superstation, being carried primarily on systems operated by cable television provider and corporate cousin, Cox Cable. However, the station was unable to compete with WTBS (now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta, and two other independent stations that were uplinked to satellite as superstations in the two years after KTVU gained national distribution, WGN-TV in Chicago and WOR-TV (now co-owned MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV) in New York City, and began to scale down its national coverage via cable in 1982. While KTVU remained a superstation for the remainder of its run as an independent, its cable coverage would become limited to providers within the Western United States—primarily those located in Northern California, Nevada, Oregon and select areas of Utah. The station continued to be distributed nationally, however, on direct broadcast satellite via C-Band systems until the late 1990s; KTVU was also carried on PrimeStar as its Fox network feed for the Pacific Time Zone until the satellite provider merged with DirecTV in 1999. KTVU also carried programming from the Operation Prime Time programming service (at least) in 1978.\n\nIn October 1985, News Corporation—which had purchased a 50% interest in 20th Century Fox corporate parent TCF Holdings for $250 million in March 1985—announced its intentions to create a fourth television network that would use the resources of 20th Century Fox Television to both produce and distribute programming, intending to compete with ABC, CBS and NBC. The company formally announced the launch of the new network, the Fox Broadcasting Company, on May 7, 1986. Subsequently, Fox approached Cox Enterprises to affiliate with the upstart network months prior to its formal launch, with KTVU agreeing to serve as its charter affiliate for the San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market. Channel 2's affiliation with Fox could be seen as a major coup for the fledgling network, because of its distinction as the highest-rated independent station in the Bay Area as well as one of the strongest independents in the U.S. It was also one of the few independents to affiliate with the network (outside of three which News Corporation had earlier acquired from Metromedia) which broadcast on the VHF band and had an established local news identity.\n\nKTVU officially joined Fox seven months later on October 9, 1986, when the fledgling network inaugurated programming with the debut of the late night talk show \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\", which was also their only program in their first months of operation. Similar to other Fox stations during the network's early years, KTVU was programmed as a \"de facto\" independent station, even after Fox expanded its programming into prime time on weekend evenings in April 1987. Until Fox completed the expansion of its prime time schedule (which began with the launch of a Saturday night lineup in July 1987, and was gradually rolled out to additional nights over the next seven years) and began offering programming on all seven nights of the week in September 1993, KTVU continued to air a movie at 8:00 p.m. on nights when the network did not offer any programming. However, the station also decreased its reliance on movies during this period, due to the growing difficulty of broadcast stations in acquiring film content as the number of cable television networks increased. The strong ratings that KTVU had as an independent station carried over into its tenure with Fox, turning it into one of the network's strongest affiliates; despite having its programming occasionally being preempted by San Francisco Giants game telecasts, Fox was very satisfied with KTVU because of its ratings performance.\n\nDuring the early and mid-1990s, the station gradually shifted the focus of its daytime schedule from a mix of off-network sitcoms and drama series to a lineup predominately made up of first-run syndicated talk, court and reality shows; it also continued to run some off-network sitcoms during the evening and late-night hours. In addition, Channel 2 began to air an afternoon cartoon block supplied by the network, Fox Kids, when the Monday through Saturday children's lineup debuted in September 1990. The station continued to run Fox Kids programming on weekdays—moving it to an earlier time period on weekday afternoons in January 2000, to build an adult-targeted audience for the pending launch of its 6:00 p.m. newscast by filling the 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. slot with talk and court shows—until the network discontinued its afternoon block in January 2002; it retained the Saturday morning lineup, which eventually became known as 4Kids TV under a programming agreement with 4Kids Entertainment, until Fox discontinued its children's programming altogether on December 27, 2008 (replacing it with the two-hour infomercial block \"Weekend Marketplace\").\n\nThroughout its affiliation with Fox under Cox Enterprises ownership, the station continued to brand itself as \"Channel 2\", even as the network began to require that its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates incorporate the \"Fox\" name within their on-air branding. However, KTVU would begin to alternately brand as \"Fox Channel 2\" by the early 1990s, which was mainly used within promotions for Fox network programs, with the network's logo being placed to the left of KTVU's longtime \"Circle Laser 2\" logo (which was first introduced in 1975). In September 1997, the Fox wordmark logo was added onto the underside of the top line of \"Circle Laser 2\"; the station also concurrently changed its branding to \"KTVU Fox 2\" as the network tightened its branding standardizations for its stations—although the previous \"KTVU Channel 2\" moniker remained in use as part of its newscast branding (the \"Fox 2\" logo and moniker was used on the station's 10:00 p.m. newscast from 2001 to 2002).\n\nOn November 29, 1999, Cox Enterprises acquired San Jose-based independent station KICU-TV from Detroit businessman and Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson and KICU president/general manager Jim Evers. The resulting pairing of KICU with KTVU created the Bay Area's first television station duopoly when the deal was finalized in March 2000; the operations of KICU migrated from that station's original studio facilities in San Jose, where KTVU relocated its South Bay news bureau, and were consolidated into KTVU's Jack London Square facility in Oakland. On March 3, 2008, KTVU celebrated its 50th anniversary of broadcasting. In honor of the anniversary, a series of fifteen promos were produced, which included those honoring past KTVU programs such as \"Romper Room\" and \"Captain Satellite\" as well as the station's sports programming.\n\nFollowing its purchase of WJZY in Charlotte, North Carolina in March 2013, \"Variety\" reported that Fox Television Stations was pursuing station acquisitions in San Francisco and Seattle as it desired to have a larger presence in the markets of NFL teams that are part of the National Football Conference (such as the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks), the conference to which Fox holds broadcast rights. Fox had for many years wanted to have an owned-and-operated station in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has always been one of the ten largest Nielsen television markets. After Fox Television Stations assumed ownership of charter affiliate WTXF-TV in Philadelphia in 1995, KTVU became the largest Fox station by market size not to be owned by the network. Fox's original parent company News Corporation (which spun off the network to 21st Century Fox in July 2013 as part of the company's separation of its entertainment and publishing assets) made several offers to buy KTVU, but Cox turned down each of News Corporation's proposals (Fox had also reportedly considered purchasing KTVU's CBS-affiliated sister station in Seattle, KIRO-TV, which would have displaced that market's charter Fox affiliate, KCPQ; such a purchase never materialized, although Fox did attempt to buy KCPQ outright before renewing its affiliation contract with that station in July 2014, after it was unsuccessful in pressuring Tribune Broadcasting to sell KCPQ by purchasing and proposing to move its programming to Bellingham, Washington-based KBCB).\n\nOn June 24, 2014, Fox announced that it would trade two of its owned-and-operated stations, WFXT in Boston and WHBQ-TV in Memphis, to the Cox Media Group in exchange for acquiring KTVU and KICU. The deal made KTVU the last Big Four network station in the Bay Area to become an owned-and-operated station of its associated network. Prior to this announcement it was rumored that Fox had considered buying rival (and former NBC affiliate) KRON-TV and moving its programming there (which would have resulted in KTVU losing its Fox affiliation to channel 4 had Fox acquired that station instead). The trade was completed on October 8, 2014, marking Channel 2's first ownership change in 51 years; the trade with Fox Television Stations also resulted in WFXT supplanting KTVU as the company's largest television station by market size. As part of the trade, Cox Media Group and Fox Television Stations also reassigned key management personnel between the two markets; KTVU-KICU general manager Tom Raponi was reassigned to serve in the same position at WFXT, while Gregg Kelley was reassigned from WFXT to become vice president and general manager of the KTVU-KICU duopoly.\n\nIn November 2014, KTVU transitioned from Cox's in-house digital platforms to those operated by Fox, which included the release of new mobile apps and the transition of its website to the WorldNow platform and the webpage layouts that the provider designed for the Fox-owned stations. On February 8, 2015, KTVU began to fully comply with Fox's station branding guidelines, extending the \"KTVU Fox 2\" brand to its news programming (as well as adopting Fox Television Stations' standardized graphics package for the group's Fox O&Os); however, the station retained the \"Circle Laser 2\" logo by both including it within the group's standardized \"boxkite\" logo and in an alternate version in which it is now placed \"next\" to the Fox wordmark (the latter became the main logo in August 2015, when KTVU introduced updated introductions for its newscasts, which de-emphasized the standardized graphics).\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC and KGO-TV, announced its intent to buy KTVU's parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $52.4 billion; the sale excluded the Fox Television Stations unit (including KTVU and KICU), the Fox network, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and the MyNetworkTV programming service, which were transferred to a separate company.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKTVU also operates a Mobile DTV simulcast feed on subchannel 2.1. The feed was originally transmitted over the MDTV signal of sister station KICU-TV, but has since moved to a standalone signal.\n\nKTVU originally launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 2.2 in 2008, as an affiliate of the Spanish-language network LATV.\n\nKTVU-DT3 originally launched in 2014, as the Bay Area affiliate of Movies!, a movie channel owned by Fox Television Stations in conjunction with Weigel Broadcasting.\n\nOn May 31, 2015, KTVU launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 2.4 to serve as a charter affiliate of the game show-focused multicast network Buzzr through an affiliation agreement with network owner FremantleMedia North America.\n\nKTVU shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal was relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 56, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to UHF channel 44 (the allocation previously occupied by KBCW's analog signal), using PSIP to display KTVU's virtual channel as 2 on digital television receivers.\n\nKTVU also operates a digital fill-in translator on UHF channel 26, which serves the southern part of the viewing area, including San Jose.\n\nSyndicated programs broadcast by KTVU () include \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", \"TMZ on TV\", and \"Seinfeld\".\n\nSince it first joined the network as an affiliate in October 1986, KTVU has generally aired the entire Fox program lineup without preemptions (except for San Francisco Giants baseball games during its contractual tenure with the team), as the network airs fewer hours of programming than that offered by CBS, NBC and ABC. The only regular exception has been \"Fox NFL Kickoff\", which KTVU has declined carriage of since the Sunday pre-game show and \"Fox NFL Sunday\" lead-in moved to Fox from Fox Sports 1 in September 2015, due to its existing commitment to carry the \"official\" San Francisco 49ers pregame show \"49ers Pre Game Live\" on Sunday mornings during the NFL regular season; \"Kickoff\" thus airs at the same time on KICU.\n\nAt first, KTVU delayed the preempted prime time programming to weekends, but with the growth of Fox and because of viewer demand, the station eventually aired network shows that were delayed from their designated prime time slots following its 10:00 p.m. newscast. From the time that Cox took over the operations of KICU in 2000 until Channel 2 lost the Giants rights after the 2007 season, the preempted Fox programming would be moved to KICU to air in their network-designated time slots.\n\nFrom 1958 until the early 1970s, KTVU aired the space-themed afternoon children's program \"Captain Satellite\", which was hosted by Bob March and was set in a fictional spaceship known as the Starfinder II. The series—which was originally produced at Moose Hall in Oakland, before moving to the KTVU studios in 1959—showcased cartoons between segments (including among others \"The Space Explorers\"), as well as film clips provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and live in-studio visits from astronauts.\n\nUntil the 1980s, the station produced a series of classic public service shorts titled \"Bits and Pieces\", often featuring two talking puppets, Charley and Humphrey, which Pat McCormick had brought over to KTVU from his tenure at KGO-TV. The shorts, which often aired during children's programs shown on the station, were aimed at delivering positive and educational messages to kids. In the late 1970s, \"Charley and Humphrey\" were spun off into a daily children's program on KTVU, which was hosted by McCormick. Channel 2 also served as the Bay Area's originating station for the children's television program franchise \"Romper Room\"; originally hosted by Nancy Besst, the half-hour program aired at 8:30 a.m. on weekday mornings for much of the 1980s.\n\nOne of the station's most successful programs—both in terms of ratings and cultural impact—was \"Creature Features\", a Saturday prime time showcase of horror movies that was originally hosted by Bob Wilkins, who had earlier hosted a popular and similarly themed show at KCRA-TV in Sacramento. Wilkins brought a straight presentation and dry wit to a television genre made ridiculous by the likes of Vampira. \"Creature Features\" became an immediate hit following its January 9, 1971 premiere telecast, eventually expanding to a double feature format in the mid-1970s, by which time it was defeating network fare such as \"Saturday Night Live\" (on KRON-TV) in the local ratings. It was these latter ratings victories that resulted in John Belushi and John Landis appearing on the program in 1978, during their promotional tour for \"National Lampoon's Animal House\". Wilkins also interviewed then-local author Anne Rice upon the publication of \"Interview with the Vampire\" as well as, among many others, Christopher Lee, William Shatner and local independent filmmaker Ernie Fosselius (of \"Hardware Wars\" fame).\n\nWilkins eventually began hosting a second program on KTVU, \"Captain Cosmic\", donning a silver motorcycle helmet and crimson cape in his portrayal of the title character. It was wherein the program that he introduced the Bay Area—and by extension, through KTVU's superstation status, the rest of the country—to Japanese anime by broadcasting such shows as \"Star Blazers\" and \"Ultra Man\". \"Captain Cosmic\" was a hit, though it ended when Wilkins retired from television in 1979; former \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reporter and occasional co-host John Stanley took over as sole host of \"Creature Features\" from 1979 until its cancellation in 1982.\n\nOther local programs that aired on KTVU during its run as an independent station included the film showcase/trivia game show franchise \"Dialing for Dollars\", which was first hosted by Mel Vinter and later by Pat McCormick, who later served as a weather anchor at the station; \"National All-Star Wrestling\", which aired on Friday nights during the early and mid-1960s from the KTVU studios or Daly City's Cow Palace and was hosted by Walt Harris; and \"Roller Derby\", which Harris also hosted for many years and featured San Francisco Bay Bombers roller derby games until the demise of the International Roller Derby League in 1973. During the early 2000s, KTVU broadcast San Francisco's Chinese New Year Parade each winter; sister station KICU generally rebroadcast the parade on the evening of its broadcast (independent station KTSF, channel 26, aired its own Chinese-language telecast of the parade using \"pool\" cameras).\n\nKTVU obtained the rights to televise San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball games in 1961, three years after the team relocated to the Bay Area from New York City. After the move, the Giants initially opted against televising their games to encourage game attendance by Bay Area residents and tourists. When channel 2 became the Giants' television partner, it was only permitted to televise the team's road games against the Los Angeles Dodgers until 1965, when the station began airing additional regular season and exhibition games (KTVU's relationship with the Giants extended to the franchise's ownership, as Cox Enterprises owned a 10% stake in the Giants during the latter years of the broadcast contract). KTVU eventually began sharing the local television rights to the Giants with SportsChannel Bay Area (now NBC Sports Bay Area, in which the Giants had purchased a 30% minority interest in December 2007) when the regional sports network launched in July 1991.\n\nChannel 2 lost the local over-the-air telecast rights to the Giants following the 2007 season, when the broadcast television contract was taken over by San Jose-based NBC owned-and-operated station KNTV (channel 11). The Giants continue to maintain a presence on Channel 2 to the present day, as some Saturday afternoon—and more recently, Saturday evening—regular season games (in addition to the team's postseason and World Series appearances) have been carried on the station since 1996, through Fox's national broadcast contract with Major League Baseball. KTVU also carried games of the cross-bay rival Oakland Athletics during that team's world championship season in 1973, and also airs Athletics games that are part of the Fox MLB broadcast contract.\n\nKTVU has also served as the market's primary official television broadcaster of the San Francisco 49ers since 1994, when Fox assumed the contractual rights to air games from the National Football Conference (NFC). The station airs most of the team's regular season and playoff games that do not have rights held by other broadcast networks (primarily those involving the 49ers' in-conference opponents), as well as other 49ers-related programming during the NFL season including the pre-game show \"49ers Pre Game Live\" (on Sunday mornings), the weekly station-produced sports program \"KTVU Mercedes-Benz Sports Weekend\" (on Saturday evenings), magazine program \"49ers Total Access\" (which follows \"Sports Wrap\" on Sunday evenings) and the \"49ers Red & Gold Specials\" (comprising four programs focusing on the 49ers' history that air on either KTVU or KICU during the team's training camp and/or preseason). The station aired the team's appearance in Super Bowl LIV.\n\nKTVU also airs most Las Vegas Raiders games (a holdover from when the team played in Oakland) in which the team plays host to an NFC team at Allegiant Stadium and starting in 2014, when the NFL instituted its new 'cross-flex' broadcast rules, any Raiders game involving another AFC team that is moved from KPIX to KTVU. The San Francisco/Golden State Warriors also aired many of their basketball games on KTVU on several occasions through the years, first from 1962 to 1963, and later from 1965 to 1968, 1969 to 1983 and the late 1990s to 2001.\n\n, KTVU presently broadcasts 67 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11½ hours on weekdays, 4½ hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest newscast output of any television station in the San Francisco Bay Area (behind MyNetworkTV affiliate KRON-TV, which carries 65 hours each week), and one of the top 4 in the country. In addition, the station produces the sports highlight program \"Sports Wrap\", which airs Saturdays at 10:45 p.m. and Sundays at 11:30 p.m. (it originally existed as a 15-minute program contained within the weekend editions of the 10:00 p.m. newscast until May 30, 2015, after which the Sunday edition was spun-off into a separate half-hour program on June 7; the program retains its 15-minute format for its Saturday edition), and the public affairs program \"Bay Area People\", which airs Saturdays at 6:30 a.m. The Saturday and Sunday editions of KTVU's 6:00 p.m. newscast are subject to preemption or delay due to network sports telecasts overrunning into or starting within either time slot; since April 2016, sister station KICU has served as an alternate broadcaster of KTVU newscasts that are preempted by network sports telecasts. KTVU was the fifth-largest Fox station overall without a newscast in a conventional late news time slot (locally in the San Francisco market, 11:00 p.m. Pacific Time). As of 2017, KTVU airs a newscast at 11:00 p.m.\n\nThe station has been well known in the Bay Area for its news programming; KTVU's news department began operations along with the station on March 3, 1958, with the launch of \"The 10 o'clock News\" (modified to a fully spelled titling in 2001, before switching to a partially numerical-based titling—as the \"Fox 2 10:00 News\", mirroring similar titling schemes for newscasts used by some of its sister stations such as Los Angeles O&O KTTV—for six months starting in February 2015 under Fox ownership, before reverting to the previous title form), which for years had been the market's only local television newscast at 10:00 p.m. Initially airing for a half-hour on Monday through Friday nights, the program was originally anchored by Les Nichols (who served as KTVU's managing editor) and Al Helmso (who also served as the station's first news director). The program has long established itself with top-drawer talent, many of whom have worked at KTVU for more than ten years. Though, early on, the program experienced turnover with its main anchor team. Nichols and Helmso stepped down as main anchors in the early 1960s, replaced by Gary Park and Stan Atkinson. The program was reformatted in 1971 as \"The Tuck-Fortner Report\", with Mike Tuck and Ron Fortner at the helm; they were replaced by Marcia Brandwynne and George Reading in 1974 (Reading would later be replaced by Atkinson and eventually, Judd Hambrick). The weeknight editions of \"The 10 o'clock News\" would expand to one hour in 1975; hour-long weekend editions were eventually added in September 1979, which were first by anchored by Elaine Corral.\n\nIn 1976, assignment reporter Dennis Richmond was appointed as the station's lead anchor and became known among local viewers for his straightforward and interpersonal, but calm and unopinionated delivery in his reporting. Richmond's co-anchors throughout his tenure were Judd Hambrick (1976–1977), Andy Park (1977–1978), Barbara Simpson (1978–1986), Elaine Corral (1986–1998, abruptly resigning on-air in March 1998), Leslie Griffith (1998–2006) and finally Julie Haener, who became weeknight co-anchor in May 2007 and remains in that capacity . Richmond anchored \"The Ten O'Clock News\" for 32 of his 40 years at KTVU until his retirement in May 2008. Replacing him was Frank Somerville, who, starting in 1992, had handled morning and noon anchor duties, before moving to the 5:00 p.m. newscast in 2005 and eventually joining Haener as lead anchor. Another mainstay of KTVU's prime time newscast was Pat McCormick, who served as a weather anchor off-and-on from 1969 until his retirement in 1995 (replacing Bob Wilkins as chief weathercaster in 1974); his successor Bill Martin, who joined Channel 2 in 1996, was the first television meteorologist in the Bay Area to provide six-day weather forecasts. Bob MacKenzie was also a fixture for many years as a feature reporter, and also did occasional topical commentary pieces, winning 13 Bay Area Emmy Awards during his tenure at the station from 1978 to 2006 (although MacKenzie would continue to file occasional reports following his formal retirement from KTVU until 2010).\n\nFor more than 40 years, \"The Ten O'Clock News\" has been the ratings leader in the San Francisco Bay Area at 10:00 p.m., with or without news competition in the arena. The program's rise to ratings dominance—even at times when weaker-rated shows led into the newscast—occurred under the helm of longtime news director Fred Zehnder (who originally joined the station as an assistant news director, before being promoted to head the news department after the firing of his predecessor Ted Kavanau in 1978). Zehnder crafted a no-nonsense journalistic style for \"The 10 o'Clock News\" that was based around in-depth and fair reporting, largely devoid of the \"happy talk\" banter among anchors that was common of other local television newscasts. During Zehnder's tenure, KTVU became one of the most respected local television news operations in the United States and earned several journalism awards over the next two decades, including Emmy, Associated Press, Peabody and duPont-Columbia Awards.\n\nThe 10:00 p.m. newscast's dominance was to such an extent that, from 1987 to 2005, the program was referenced in its title sequence and some news promotions as \"the number one prime time newscast in the country\", a factual statement based on the number of viewers watching the program at that hour, even beating network programs airing against it on KRON-TV, KGO-TV and KPIX on most nights. It was such a force to be reckoned with that when KRON and KPIX respectively timeshifted NBC and CBS' prime time lineups one hour earlier as part of the \"early prime\" network scheduling experiment in February 1992, \"The 10 o'clock News\" handily beat the late evening newscasts that both stations had consequently moved up to 10:00. KRON would move its late news back to the 11:00 p.m. slot in September 1993; KPIX would not follow suit until September 1998 (although it would later begin producing a competing half-hour 10:00 newscast for KBCW in March 2008). In stark contrast, when KRON became an independent station in January 2002, it initially scheduled its new prime time newscast at 9:00 p.m. to avoid competing directly with KTVU (KRON would eventually restore a newscast at 10:00 p.m. on May 16, 2016). Moreover, WB affiliate KBWB (now KOFY-TV) canceled its KNTV-produced 10:00 p.m. newscast after four years in 2002, as it was unable to compete with KTVU in the ratings. During this period, KTVU branded its flagship newscast as \"The Original Ten O'Clock News\".\n\n\"The Ten O'Clock News\" is also one of the few local newscasts in the United States to have been syndicated to other television stations. , the program also airs on Fox affiliate KCBA in Monterey (which also carries the weekday editions of \"Mornings on 2\"), MyNetworkTV affiliates KRVU-LD in Chico and KEMY-LP in Eureka, California, and Fox affiliate KRXI-TV in Reno, Nevada (the latter of which was co-owned with KTVU under Cox Enterprises from 1997 to 2013, and had also carried KTVU's morning and noon newscasts until Cox discontinued its agreement with KRXI owner Sinclair Broadcast Group to air both programs on May 14, 2014).\n\nThroughout its run as an independent station, \"The 10 o'clock News\" was the only news program on KTVU. The station first began programming news outside its established 10:00 p.m. slot in September 1986, when it debuted \"2 at Noon\". Originally anchored by Barbara Simpson and Bob MacKenzie, the hour-long midday news-talk program—which replaced syndicated game shows in the noon time slot—featured a hybrid of in-depth interviews and various lifestyle features, preceded by a news summary during the first half-hour. The program was reformatted into a more traditional newscast in 1990, as \"The Noon News\", at which time it was shortened to a half-hour (the newscast would eventually revert to an hour on April 7, 2016). In September 1989, the station debuted a half-hour 6:00 p.m. newscast, \"The 6:00 News\", which lasted until its cancellation in 1991.\n\nChannel 2 eventually decided to shift towards a news-intensive format to compete with KRON, KPIX, KGO-TV and KNTV that took the course of several years to take effect; Fox has never carried any national network newscasts (aside from news updates produced out of its New York City station WNYW that aired during prime time from 1987 to 1990, and four attempts at newsmagazines between 1987 and 2003), but it still motivated its affiliates, including KTVU, to air more local news programming. The station's original morning newscast, \"Mornings on 2\", debuted on January 2, 1991 as a two-hour broadcast from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., replacing animated series in the time period (the program would expand to three hours on September 14, 2015); as such, it became the fourth Fox station to air a newscast on weekday mornings. This was followed on August 5, 1996, by the debut of an additional hour-long newscast at 6:00 a.m. (which would gradually expand to three hours, now beginning at 4:00 a.m.). Early evening newscasts later returned on March 27, 2000 with the debut of a new half-hour 6:00 p.m. newscast (which expanded to an hour on April 25, 2016), followed in April 2005 by the addition of an hour-long 5:00 p.m. newscast on weekdays (an expansion of an existing weekend-only newscast that debuted in 1998).\n\nBesides beating out its competition in the 10:00 p.m. time slot, \"The Ten O'Clock News\" has also placed ahead of KRON, KPIX and KGO's 11:00 p.m. newscasts in overall late news viewership for much of its history; however as its news programming expanded, KTVU's newscasts avidly competed for first overall with KRON-TV and KGO-TV during the 1990s. Its newscasts became the highest-rated among the Bay Area's television stations in the early 2000s, firmly taking first place from KRON-TV following Channel 4's January 2002 disaffiliation from NBC. The May 1999 retirement of Zehnder brought changes to the newsroom; however, KTVU was ranked as the highest quality local newscast in the nation in 2000 by the Project for Excellence in Journalism under his immediate successor, Andrew Finlayson (who began his tenure at KTVU as a noon news producer in 1988, and left the station in 2003), while maintaining the top ratings slot at 10:00 and throughout the noon and morning newscasts. Varying prime time numbers and improvements at competitors (as well as audience erosion for local programming in general) have since led to a decline in the once-dominant news operation's ratings, although it retains the #1 spot, a rarity for a Fox station. For the month of August 2010, KTVU's newscasts ranked #1 among adult viewers 25–54, beating KPIX, KGO, KNTV and KRON.\n\nKTVU had used the \"KTVU News Theme\" by Michael Randall as the primary theme music for its newscasts from 1987 (debuting alongside a custom title sequence for the 10:00 p.m. newscast that was updated in 1994 and used until 2001, featuring a CGI fly-over of the Bay Area showcasing the program's title logo gliding across the waters of the San Francisco Bay) until the package was replaced on June 23, 2010 by a new 615 Music-composed theme called \"Icon News\". In the 2000s, Channel 2 became the last news-producing English language station in the Bay Area to begin utilizing a helicopter for news gathering, with the introduction of \"News Chopper 2\" (now known as \"SkyFox\" as part of the rebranding by Fox after its acquisition). On October 10, 2006, KTVU became the first television station in the Bay Area (and the third Cox-owned station, after Atlanta flagship WSB-TV and WFTV in Orlando) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; with the upgrade, the station debuted a new state-of-the-art studio designed for HD newscast production, which replaced the previous set that had been in use since 1986 (with refreshes in 1993, 1999 and 2004); video from remote and field equipment was initially broadcast in 480p standard definition following the transition; high definition cameras are now utilized for field reports.\nOn January 21, 2008, the station began producing a half-hour newscast at 7:00 p.m. each weeknight for sister station KICU-TV. In 2010, the KTVU news department was honored with a Peabody Award for its coverage of the June 2009 shooting of unarmed African-American male Oscar Grant in a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) terminal. On January 22, 2011, KTVU launched two-hour newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., becoming the largest Fox affiliate and the second-largest Fox station – behind the network's Dallas O&O KDFW – to carry newscasts on weekend mornings (the program later expanded to three hours until 10:00 a.m. in January 2014). Two days later on January 24, 2011, KTVU expanded its weekday morning newscast to 4½ hours, with the addition of a half-hour at 4:30 a.m.\n\nIn March 2014, KTVU began using the AFD #10 broadcast flag to present its newscasts in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable through 4:3 television sets (the AFD #10 flag had already been used to show Fox programming on the station in letterbox on Bay Area cable and IPTV providers). In February 2015, KTVU introduced a new graphics package, accompanied by the replacement of the \"Icon News\" package with OSI Music's \"Fox Affiliate News Theme\", matching with the imaging style of other Fox Television Stations-owned outlets and implementing the \"Fox 2\" brand universally. On June 22, 2015 (originally announced in an April 14 release that also announced the expansion of \"Mornings on 2\" by a half-hour earlier at 4:00 a.m. on April 20), KTVU debuted an hour-long 4:00 p.m. newscast, marking the first time that a Fox owned-and-operated station would air a newscast during that hour since a short-lived 4:30 p.m. effort on former Boston O&O WFXT in 2002 that lasted for one year (all but two of Fox's other O&Os start their early-evening news blocks at 5:00 p.m.).\n\nDuring the July 12, 2013, noon newscast, anchor Tori Campbell read a news release that claimed to identify the four pilots of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, which crash landed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6. A summer intern at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had incorrectly confirmed the spellings of the satirical names to a KTVU staffer who called to verify the release. The names read were: Captain Sum Ting Wong (\"something['s] wrong\"), Wi Tu Lo (\"we [are] too low\", referring to the plane's altitude), Ho Lee Fuk (\"holy fuck\", but pronounced by Campbell as \"\") and Bang Ding Ow (onomatopoeia for hitting the ground and exclamations of pain).\n\nThe NTSB apologized for its role in the incident, stating in a press release that \"appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.\" Several KTVU staff were let go, and a news producer, Elvin Sledge, left, reportedly for health reasons.\n\nAsiana Airlines announced on July 15, 2013, that it would file a defamation lawsuit against KTVU, claiming the incident damaged the airline's reputation, but withdrew it a few days later, stating that it would instead \"concentrate all [their] efforts on dealing with the aftermath of the accident.\" KTVU filed requests through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove user-uploaded videos of the prank, causing some criticism for \"trying to cover up their mistake.\" The station contended that the takedowns were intended to lessen insensitivity towards the Asian community.\n\nThe station received complaints after the 6 p.m. newscast on October 9, 2019 featured a headline about the Atlanta Braves being \"scalped\" when losing the deciding Game 5 of the National League Division Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, 13-1. Viewers who took to social media to express their disapproval stated the station used language considered to be insensitive to the Native American culture. KTVU issued a statement the following day regretting the incident.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1952244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952244", "title": "Environmental toxicants and fetal development", "text": "Environmental toxicants and fetal development\n\nEnvironmental toxicants and fetal development is the impact of different toxic substances from the environment on the development of the fetus. This article deals with potential adverse effects of environmental toxicants on the prenatal development of both the embryo or fetus, as well as pregnancy complications. The human embryo or fetus is relatively susceptible to impact from adverse conditions within the mother's environment. Substandard fetal conditions often cause various degrees of developmental delays, both physical and mental, for the growing baby. Although some variables do occur as a result of genetic conditions pertaining to the father, a great many are directly brought about from environmental toxins that the mother is exposed to.\n\nVarious toxins pose a significant hazard to fetuses during development. A 2011 study found that virtually all US pregnant women carry multiple chemicals, including some banned since the 1970s, in their bodies. Researchers detected polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, phenols, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perchlorate PBDEs, compounds used as flame retardants, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a pesticide banned in the United States in 1972, in the bodies of 99 to 100 percent of the pregnant women they tested. Bisphenol A (BPA) was identified in 96 percent of the women surveyed. Several of the chemicals were at the same concentrations that have been associated with negative effects in children from other studies and it is thought that exposure to multiple chemicals can have a greater impact than exposure to only one substance.\n\nEnvironmental toxicants can be described separately by what effects they have, such as structural abnormalities, altered growth, functional deficiencies, congenital neoplasia, or even death for the fetus.\n\nOne in ten US babies is born preterm and about 5% have low birth weight. Preterm birth, defined as birth at less than 37 weeks of gestation, is a major basis of infant mortality throughout childhood. Exposures to environmental toxins such as lead, tobacco smoke, and DDT have been linked with an increased risk for spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, or preterm birth.\n\nToxic substances that are capable of causing structural congenital abnormalities can be termed \"teratogen\"s. They are agents extrinsic to embryo or fetus which exert deleterious effects leading to increased risk of malformation, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, altered function, deficient growth or pregnancy wastage. Teratogens are classified in four main categories:\nTeratogens affect the fetus by various mechanism including:\n\nNeuroplastic effects of pollution can give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nMany cases of autism are related to particular geographic locations, implying that something in the environment is complementing an at-risk genotype to cause autism in vulnerable individuals. These findings regarding autism are controversial, however, with many researchers believing that increasing rates in certain areas are a consequence of more accurate screening and diagnostic methods, and are not due to any sort of environmental factor.\n\nSubstances which have been found to be particularly harmful are lead (which is stored in the mother's bones), cigarette smoke, alcohol, mercury (a neurological toxicant consumed through fish), carbon dioxide, and ionizing radiation.\n\nDrinking alcohol in pregnancy can result in a range of disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The most severe of these is fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\nFetal exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke may experience a wide range of behavioral, neurological, and physical difficulties. Adverse effects include stillbirth, placental disruption, prematurity, lower mean birth weight, physical birth defects (cleft palate etc.), decrements in lung function, increased risk of infant mortality.\n\nElemental mercury and methylmercury are two forms of mercury that may pose risks of mercury poisoning in pregnancy. Methylmercury, a worldwide contaminant of seafood and freshwater fish, is known to produce adverse nervous system effects, especially during brain development. Eating fish is the main source of mercury exposure in humans and some fish may contain enough mercury to harm the developing nervous system of an embryo or fetus, sometimes leading to learning disabilities. Mercury is present in many types of fish, but it is mostly found in certain large fish. \nOne well-documented case of widespread mercury ingestion and subsequent fetal development complication took place in the 1950s in Minamata Bay, Japan. Used by a nearby industrial plant in the manufacture of plastics, methyl mercury was discharged into the waters of Minamata Bay, where it went on to be ingested regularly by many villagers who used the fish living in the bay as a dietary staple. Soon, many of the inhabitants who had been consuming the mercury-laden meat began experiencing negative effects from ingesting the toxin; however, the mercury especially impacted pregnant women and their fetuses, resulting in a high rate of miscarriage. Surviving infants exposed to mercury in-utero had extremely high rates of physical and mental handicaps, as well as physical abnormalities from exposure in the womb during key stages in fetal physical development.\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency advise pregnant women not to eat swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish and limit consumption of albacore tuna to 6 ounces or less a week.\n\nHigh mercury levels in newborns in Gaza are theorized to originate from war weaponry.\n\nMercury exposure in pregnancy may also cause limb defects.\n\nAdverse effects of lead exposure in pregnancy include miscarriage, low birth weight, neurological delays, anemia, encephalopathy, paralysis, blindness,\n\nThe developing nervous system of the fetus is particularly vulnerable to lead toxicity. Neurological toxicity is observed in children of exposed women as a result of the ability of lead to cross the placental barrier. A special concern for pregnant women is that some of the bone lead accumulation is released into the blood during pregnancy. Several studies have provided evidence that even low maternal exposures to lead produce intellectual and behavioral deficits in children.\n\nDioxins and dioxin-like compounds persists in the environment for a long time and are widespread, so all people have some amount of dioxins in the body. Intrauterine exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds have been associated with subtle developmental changes on the fetus. Effects on the child later in life include changes in liver function, thyroid hormone levels, white blood cell levels, and decreased performance in tests of learning and intelligence.\n\nAir pollution can negatively affect a pregnancy resulting in higher rates of preterm births, growth restriction, and heart and lung problems in the infant.\n\nCompounds such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide all have the potential to cause serious damage when inhaled by an expecting mother. Low birth weight, preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and congenital abnormalities have all been found to be associated with fetal exposure to air pollution. Although pollution can be found virtually everywhere, there are specific sources that have been known to release toxic substances and should be avoided if possible by those who wish to remain relatively free of toxins. These substances include, but are not limited to: steel mills, waste/water treatment plants, sewage incinerators, automotive fabrication plants, oil refineries, and chemical manufacturing plants.\n\nControl of air pollution can be difficult. For example, in Los Angeles, regulations have been made to control pollution, by putting rules on industrial and vehicle emissions. Improvements have been made to meet these regulations. Despite these improvements, the region still does not meet federal standards for ozone and particulate matter. Approximately 150,000 births occur every year in Los Angeles. Thus, any effects air pollution has on human development \"in utero\" are of great concern to those who live in this region.\n\nParticulate matter (PM) consist of a mixture of particle pollutants that remain in the air, and vary be region. These particles are very small, ranging from PM10 to PM 2.5, which can easily enter the lungs. Particulate matter has been shown to be associated with acute cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality. Intrauterine growth has been shown to be affected by particulate matter, leading to unhealthy outcomes for fetal development such as poor or slow fetal growth, and increasing fetal morbidity and mortality. A study from 2012 found that exposures to PM 2.5 differed by race/ethnicity, age, as well as socioeconomic status, leading to certain populations experiencing greater negative health outcomes due to environmental pollution, especially relating to particulate matter.\n\nPesticides are created for the specific purpose of\ncausing harm (to insects, rodents, and other pests), pesticides have\nthe potential to serious damages to a developing fetus, should they be\nintroduced into the fetal environment. Studies have shown that\npesticides, particularly fungicides, have shown up in analyses of\ninfant's cord blood, proving that such toxins are indeed transferred\ninto the baby's body. Overall, the two\npesticides most frequently detected in cord blood are diethyltoluamide\n(DEET) and vinclozolin (a fungicide). Although pesticide toxicity is not as frequently\nmentioned as some of the other methods of environmental toxicity, such\nas air pollution, contamination can occur at any time from merely\nengaging in everyday activities such as walking down a pathway near a\ncontaminated area, or eating foods that have not been washed properly. In 2007 alone, 1.1 billion pounds of\npesticides were found present in the environment, causing pesticide\nexposure to gain notoriety as a new cause of caution to those wishing\nto preserve their health.\n\nA 2013 review of 27 studies on prenatal and early childhood exposures to organophosphate pesticides found all but one showed negative neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the ten studies that assessed prenatal exposure, \"cognitive deficits (related to working memory) were found in children at age 7 years, behavioral deficits (related to attention) seen mainly in toddlers, and motor deficits (abnormal reflexes), seen mainly in neonates.\"\n\nA systematic review of neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and postnatal organophosphate pesticide exposure was done in 2014. The review found that \"Most of the studies evaluating prenatal exposure observed a negative effect on mental development and an increase in attention problems in preschool and school children.\"\n\nIn 2017, a study looked at the possible effects of agricultural pesticides in over 500,000 births in a largely agricultural region of California and compared their findings to birth outcomes in other less agriculturally dominated California areas. Overall, they found \nthat pesticide exposure increased adverse birth outcomes by 5–9%, but only among those mothers exposed to the highest quantities of pesticides. \n\nBenzene exposure in mothers has been linked to fetal brain defects especially neural tube defects. In one study, BTEX (Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy has been clearly indicating negative association with biparietal brain diameter between 20 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. Women with high exposure to toluene had three to five times the miscarriage rate of those with low exposure, and women with occupational benzene exposure have been shown to have an increased rate of miscarriages. Paternal occupational exposure to toluene and formaldehyde has also been linked to miscarriage in their partners. Normal development is highly controlled by hormones, and disruption by man made chemicals can permanently change the course of development. Ambient ozone has been negatively associated with sperm concentration in men, chemicals associated with UOG operations (e.g., benzene, toluene, formaldehyde, ethylene glycol and ozone) have been associated with negative impacts on semen quality, particularly reduced sperm counts.\n\nA 2011 study found a relationship between Neural Tube Defects and maternal exposure to benzene, a compound associated with natural gas extraction. The study found that mothers living in Texas census tracts with higher ambient benzene levels were more likely to have offspring with neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, than mothers living in areas with lower benzene levels.\n\n\nThe \"American College of Nurse-Midwives\" recommends the following precautions to minimize exposure to relevant environmental toxins in pregnancy:\n\nIn a rural Colorado study of natural gas development, maternal residence within a 10-mile radius of natural gas wells was found to have a positive association to the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHDs) and neural tube defects (NTDs). Along with this finding, a small association was found between mean birth weight and the density and proximity to the natural gas wells. Maternal exposure through natural gas wells may come in the form of benzene, solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other air pollutants such as toluene, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, unconventional natural gas producing wells increased from zero in 2005 to 3689 in 2013. A 2016 study of 9384 mothers and 10946 neonates in the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania found prenatal residential exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity was associated with preterm birth and physician-recorded high-risk pregnancy. In Southwest Pennsylvania, maternal proximity to unconventional gas drilling has been found to be associated with decreased birth weight. It was unclear which route of exposure: air, soil or water could be attributed to the association. Further research and larger studies on this topic are needed.\n\nEndocrine disruptors are compounds that can disrupt the normal development and normal hormone levels in humans. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interact with hormone receptors, as well as change hormone concentrations within the body, leading to incorrect hormone responses in the body as well as disrupt normal enzyme functioning. Oil and gas extraction has been known to contribute to EDCs in the environment, largely due to the high risk of ground and surface water contamination that comes with these extractions. In addition to water contamination, oil and gas extraction also lead to higher levels of air pollution, creating another route of exposure for these endocrine disruptors. This problem often goes under-reported, and therefore, the true magnitude of the impact is underestimated. In 2016, a study was conducted to assess the need for an endocrine component to health assessments for drilling and extraction of oil and gas in densely populated areas. With the high potential for release of oil and gas chemicals with extraction, specifically chemicals that have been shown to disrupt normal hormone production and function, the authors highly emphasized the need for a component centering around endocrine function and overall health with health assessments, and how this in turn impacts the environment.\n\nThe healthy placenta is a semipermeable membrane that does form a barrier for most pathogens and for certain xenobiotic substances. However, it is by design an imperfect barrier since it must transport substances required for growth and development. Placental transport can be by passive diffusion for smaller molecules that are lipid soluble or\nby active transport for substances that are larger and/or electrically charged. Some toxic chemicals may be actively transported. The dose of a substance received by the fetus is determined by the amount of the substance transported across the placenta as well as the rate of metabolism\nand elimination of the substance. As the fetus has an immature metabolism, it is unable to detoxify substances very efficiently; and as the placenta plays such an important role in substance exchange between the mother and the fetus, it goes without saying that any toxic substances that the mother is exposed to are transported to the\nfetus, where they can then affect development. Carbon-dioxide, lead, ethanol (alcohol), and cigarette smoke in particular are all substances that have a high likelihood of placental transferral.\n\nIdentifying potential hazards for fetal development requires a basis of scientific information. In 2004, Brent proposed a set of criteria for identifying causes of congenital malformations that also are applicable to developmental toxicity in general. Those criteria are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1952247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952247", "title": "Felix Sabates", "text": "Felix Sabates\n\nFeliciano Sergio \"Félix\" Sabates Jr. (born September 9, 1945) is a retired Cuban-born entrepreneur and philanthropist living in the United States.\n\nHe is currently a partner in Chip Ganassi Racing teams, which fields teams in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (as Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates), IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, World Endurance Championship and the IndyCar Series. Sabates previously owned his own NASCAR team, SABCO Racing, until the end of the 2000 season when Chip Ganassi and Sabates became partners.\n\nFelix Sabates was born in Camagüey, Cuba, living there until the age of 15. Sabates is the oldest of seven children — three boys (Feliciano \"Felix\" Jr., Jose, Arturo \"Art\") and four girls (Silvia, Yoyi, Manty, Rosita) — of Dr. Feliciano Sabates and Maria Tavio. Sabates' grandfather grew sugar until a fire destroyed the business in the 1930s. Sabates' family then founded a jewelry store in 1936. The family would later found several successful business including import and export, jewelry, optical stores, insurance sales, sugar, cattle, service stations and pharmacies, many of which bore the family name. Sabates attended military school as a teenager, first in Havana, and later in Camagüey. According to Sabates, he was a bunkmate with one of the sons of Fidel Castro.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution, the newly established communist government headed by Fidel Castro proceeded to nationalize many businesses and strip citizens of individual wealth. This included the assets of Sabates' family. After joining anti-Castro forces, in June 1960, at the age of 15, Felix was put on a flight to Miami by his parents. He was the first member of the family to enter the United States of America. Five of his six brothers and sisters would later arrive in the U.S. under Operation Peter Pan, sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico and placed in foster care. Sabates' mother and youngest brother Art fled in 1963, while his father arrived in 1966 after being restricted by the Castro administration.\n\nSabates initially settled in Boston, Massachusetts with his aunt and uncle, before moving to Columbia, Missouri. In between, Sabates lived in motels and worked several odd jobs, including washing pots and pans at a hospital. Eventually, the family would reconvene in Lexington, North Carolina (where his mother originally settled), in a resettlement site for Cuban refugees established by an American-based Catholic charity.\n\nIn Lexington, Sabates began working 12-hour shifts in a furniture factory. One year later in 1964, after an encounter with the Ku Klux Klan, his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, and he began working at National Car Rental as a parking lot attendant and washing cars at the Charlotte Airport. Later, Sabates began working at the City Chevrolet car dealership in Downtown Charlotte (later purchased by fellow NASCAR owner Rick Hendrick), offering to work for free on the condition that if he outsells the other salesman within a month, that he would be compensated and offered a permanent sales position. Sabates was successful with record car sales. When a local newspaper article had recounted this story about the top salesman, it caught the eye of a local businessman who proceeded to offer him a different sales position with potential growth as a manufacturer's representative.\n\nIn 1969 at the age of 25, Sabates accepted a position as a salesman for Top Sales Company, Inc. (TSC) which distributed retail products. Sabates would purchase the company in 1974. Early products distributed by TSC included Atari game consoles and Teddy Ruxpin teddy bears. At its peak, TSC became the largest, most successful manufacturer’s representative company in the United States with over $12 billion in sales. In 2000, Sabates sold TSC to his employees at what was considered a well below market rate to “reward the people that helped him build the business.”\n\nIn 1988, Sabates purchased a Hatteras Yacht dealership in Stuart, Fla. and within two years Sabates had turned it into the largest Hatteras dealership in the world. Sabates, along with his partner John Dane, followed that up with the purchase of the number one custom superyacht builder in the world - Trinity Yachts in 2000. He also owns IYC, one of the largest yacht management, charter, brokerage and new construction yachts companies in the world, with offices in Monaco, the Bahamas, Saint Martin and the U.S. He is also the president and CEO of FSS Holdings, Inc., a North Carolina-based holding company with holdings in several U.S. and international companies.\n\nSabates owns and operates a Mercedes Benz dealership that is a four-time recipient of the Best of the Best Award given to only the top 10 percent of dealers nationwide. He also operates the largest volume Infiniti dealership in North Carolina as well as Hyundai, Mazda, Sprinter and Smart Car auto dealerships. A Sabates owned Bentley dealership closed in 2015.\n\nIn 1987, Sabates became a NASCAR team owner with the purchase of a Hendrick Motorsports research and development team from Charlotte businessman Rick Hendrick, who also owns Chevrolet dealerships. The team would be known as SABCO Racing. Sabates' first driver in 1989 was third-generation racer Kyle Petty (Sabates was a huge fan of his father, Richard Petty). In 1992, Sabates' team branched out into the Busch Series. Petty found his groove in the Winston Cup circuit, finishing in the top-five in the final point standings for the season. The team fielded both cars in the Winston Cup circuit the following year and Petty again finished top-five in total points.\n\nSABCO Racing changed to Team SABCO at the beginning of the 1996 season. Sabates expanded his operation to two teams. Drivers for SABCO included Sterling Marlin, Bobby Hillin, Jr., Tommy Kendall, Kenny Irwin, Jr., Kenny Wallace, Bobby Hamilton, Robby Gordon, Greg Sacks, Wally Dallenbach Jr., Joe Nemechek, Jeff Green, and Ted Musgrave.\n\nIn 2001 Sabates partnered with Chip Ganassi to become Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates. Ganassi would purchase an 80 percent stake in the team, with Sabates retaining the remaining 20 percent. Later on, he became responsible for hiring the first Latino driver in NASCAR's Sprint Cup Series in 2006, former Indy 500 champion Juan Pablo Montoya. Prior to the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, due to financial woes, the team merged with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to form Earnhardt Ganassi Racing. The team would revert to the Ganassi Racing name in 2014.\n\nAs of 2019, the team's drivers include Kurt Busch in the No. 1 car & Kyle Larson in the No. 42. In his nearly 30 seasons in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Sabates’ teams have 17 wins, 130 top-five and 352 top-10 finishes as well as 40 poles in nearly 1800 starts. His team made the Chase for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series four times (2009, 2015 & 2016 (2)), finished in the top five in points in three different seasons and won the 2010 Daytona 500 and Brickyard 400. In addition, Sabates and Ganassi also fielded a Daytona Prototype in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series for 13 years, where the team won an unprecedented six Rolex 24 At Daytonas and seven championships. Their No. 01 team is the winningest team in series history with 40 victories. Past drivers include Luis Diaz, Stefan Johansson and Cort Wagner. In 2016 the sports car team began racing the new Ford GT in both IMSA and in the World Endurance Championship and would ultimately go on to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans that year - exactly 50 years after Ford beat Ferrari for the first time in 1966.\n\nIn 1988, Sabates became one of the founding owners of the original Charlotte Hornets basketball team. Sabates played an intricate part negotiating with the NBA to grant franchise rights to Charlotte. Sabates sold his interests in 1991. After starting the first professional indoor soccer league in the 1980s, he was one of the first investors in the World Football League. Also in the 1990s, he established The Charlotte Professional Sports Team, Inc, along with Hornets executive Carl Scheer, and his NASCAR driver, Kyle Petty, and his father Richard Petty. The company returned professional hockey to Charlotte for the first time since 1977, when the ECHL placed the Charlotte Checkers expansion franchise in Charlotte for 1993. In 1996, the Checkers won the Jack Riley Cup championship after competing in the ECHL for just three years. Soon after, the team was sold at a then-record price for a minor-league professional franchise, to Tim Braswell, who sold the team in 2000 to George Shinn and Ray Woolridge, the Hornets owners. Sabates and Carl Scheer would buy back the team in 2002. In November 2005, the Checkers hit an all-time attendance record of 10,894.\n\nSabates is also the only person that had ownership in the Hornets in the 1980s/1990s to now also have an ownership stake with Michael Jordan in the Charlotte Hornets franchise in the 2010s.\n\nIn July 2016, the NBA announced that it was removing the 2017 All-Star game from Charlotte due to North Carolina's controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, also known as House Bill 2 or HB2. The Charlotte Observer obtained a letter from Sabates blaming Charlotte's City Council for losing the game, which was projected to have a $100 million impact on the state. His letter reportedly stated:\n\n\"Our Mayor opened a can of worms, who knows why? One Our city council is the one to blame for our losing the NBA All Star game, none of this would have happened if not for a very few minority forcing our supposed city leaders into creating a problem that never really existed, there will always be another election, they better pray a very few can get them re-elected.\nWhat is wrong with a person using a bathroom provided for the sex the (sic) were born with, if you want to change your gender so be it, we are a free county, but don't force 8 years old children to be exposed to having to share bathroom facilities with people that don't share the organs they were Bourne (sic) with, this is plain wrong, this could cause irreparable damages to a children's (sic) that don't understand why they have to see what God did not mean for them to witness, we have some very confused business as well as political humans that frankly have made this a political issue rather then (sic) moral issues, SHAME ON THEM.\" \n\nIn addition to his successes in sports, Sabates also focuses much attention on civic activities. Sabates has served on the Board of Directors for Carolinas Health Care Systems for the past 27 years. He also serves on the Board of Directors for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the Applica Corporation, Simpson Products, the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce and he also was the co-chair of a North Carolina Institute of Medicine Task Force on Latino Health. Additionally Sabates was appointed to two terms on the North Carolina Banking Commission. In fact, he has been appointed to commissions by three different North Carolina governors, Jim Martin (R), Mike Easley (D) and most recently by Governor Pat McCrory (R) to vice chairman of the Oversight committee of the Airport Authority of North Carolina which oversees the Charlotte airport, the sixth busiest in the world.\n\nSabates is also well known for his many philanthropic contributions and has received several honors and awards for his work. Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina has named its dining hall after him, Elon College and UNC Charlotte bestowed upon him Honorary Doctorate degrees, and he received a \"Special Blessing\" in writing from Pope John Paul II. Sabates became a member of the philanthropic Dream Makers Society of the Boys and Girls Club of Broward County, Fla., in recognition of his 12-year commitment to and support of special fund raising events. In his honor, the Felix Sabates Athletic Center was dedicated in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in November 2000. The facility is the largest Boys and Girls Club in the state. He is also a large contributor to the North Carolina Health Care System Foundation, the Allegro Foundation to benefit children with special needs, as well as the Levine Children's Hospital that bears a special plaque in his honor is in the main lobby.\n\nFelix is a member of the Republican Party. He supports local Republicans, and has supported GOP presidential nominees since the 1970s. Sabates was also appointed by Governor Jim Martin as a commissioner of the North Carolina State Banking Commission. \n\nSabates has three children and six grandchildren. His daughter Mimi is married to former NHRA driver Doug Herbert\n\nOn August 2, 2014, Sabates' 18-year-old grandson Feliciano \"Chany Boy\" Sabates IV was fatally shot at a party in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\n"}

Since 1995, Jun'ya \"ZUN\" Ōta has independently developed programming, graphics, writing, and music for the series, self-publishing 22 main titles . In addition to the bullet hell games, Team Shanghai Alice has produced six official spin-off fighting games in collaboration with developer Twilight Frontier, as well as various related print works and music albums.\n\nThe setting of the \"Touhou Project\" is Gensokyo, a \"fantasy land\" sealed from the outside world and primarily inhabited by humans and \"yōkai\", legendary creatures from Japanese folklore. Reimu Hakurei, the main character of the series and the maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, is often tasked with resolving supernatural \"incidents\" caused by antagonistic \"yōkai\" and others. The first five titles were developed for the Japanese NEC PC-9800 computer series, with the first, \"Highly Responsive to Prayers\", released in August 1997; \"danmaku\" (弾幕 \"barrage\", \"bullet curtain\") mechanics were introduced in the second game, \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\". The release of \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\" in August 2002 marked a shift to Microsoft Windows, bringing the series to a wider audience. Numerous sequels followed, including several spin-offs from the traditional bullet hell format.\n\nThe \"Touhou Project\" has become notable as a prominent source of Japanese \"dōjin\" content, with the series spawning a vast body of fan-made works including artwork, music, print works, video games, anime, and Internet memes. The popularity of the series and its derivative works has been attributed in part to the few restrictions placed by ZUN on the use of his characters and settings. Unofficial works are frequently sold at fan conventions, including Comiket, where the franchise has frequently held the record for circle participation, and the official convention Reitaisai, where trial versions of the official games are typically distributed prior to release.\n\nThe first five games in the series were developed by Jun'ya Ōta (太田 順也 \"Ōta Jun'ya\"), an amateur Japanese developer working under the name \"ZUN Soft\". Ōta, then a 17-year-old mathematics student at Tokyo Denki University, independently developed the titles for the NEC PC-9800 personal computer series, utilizing the platform's 16-bit color graphics and six-channel FM synthesis audio. The titles were officially published by Amusement Makers, a student video game development club that he was a member of.\n\nAfter the release of \"Mystic Square\", ZUN graduated from university and the series became inactive for four years. During this period, he began employment at Taito Corporation as a game developer, while also composing music for various games created by members of Amusement Makers. He left the group in 2001 to focus on the development of games for Microsoft Windows, forming the one-man \"dōjin\" circle Team Shanghai Alice and self-publishing all subsequent titles. According to ZUN, the Windows games represent a \"clean slate\" for the series canon, albeit with many carry-overs and references from the PC-98 era. Games numbered with decimals are spin-offs from the main series that vary in genre.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2016, ten music CDs were released as part of \"ZUN's Music Collection\". They are numbered from Volume 1 to 9 by release date, with \"Unknown Flower, Mesmerizing Journey\" being numbered as 5.5 due to its small size. Each album contains arrangements of music from the games as well as new compositions: \nEach album (except \"Dolls in Pseudo Paradise\" and \"Unknown Flower, Mesmerizing Journey\") includes a booklet written by ZUN documenting the activities of the \"Secret Sealing Club\" (秘封倶楽部 Hifū Kurabu), a self-described \"club of necromancers\" in Kyoto, Japan. In the loose collection of stories, club members Renko Usami and Maribel Hearn research and discuss various topics relating to Gensokyo and the paranormal; \"Dolls in Pseudo Paradise\" includes an unrelated story about the fate of eight thieves spirited away to Gensokyo.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, ZUN released \"Akyu's Untouched Score\" (幺樂団の歴史 Yōgakudan no Rekishi, lit. \"History of Yougakudan\"), a five-volume collection of PC-98 soundtracks that includes several unused themes. The albums respectively cover \"Lotus Land Story\", \"Mystic Square\", \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", \"Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream\", and \"Highly Responsive to Prayers\". Each track in the collection was enhanced with the addition of a sixth FM synthesis channel, which was originally reserved for sound effects in the games:\nOriginal soundtracks for the six official fighting games have also been released. The albums primarily consist of arrangements by of Twilight Frontier, with several arrangements and/or new compositions by ZUN:\n\n\"ZUN's Music Collection\", \"Akyu's Untouched Score\", and the fighting game soundtracks have been released for digital download on Google Play and the iTunes Store (Japan, US). Several music CDs have accompanied copies of official print works; these are listed below.\n\n\nIn the shooting games, the player's bullet power increases on a linear scale as the player collects power-ups dropped by enemies, and eventually maxes out. The player can also collect 'point' icons to earn extra lives; the amount needed grows exponentially as the player's score rises. The player can use 'focus', the shift key by default, which slows down the player's movement, makes the collision box visible, and (generally; some characters are reversed) focuses the player's attack to make it more powerful. The graze counter, missing from \"Mountain of Faith\" and \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", tracks how many bullets entered the character sprite but avoided the collision box, and rewards the player with a score bonus for living on the edge.\n\nThe player can use a weapon called a 'spell card', which is similar to a 'bomb' in most other shooting games. While the player has a limited number, using one makes the user temporarily invulnerable and uses a special magical attack that generally clears the screen. Each character has two cards with different names and patterns. The player can use one during a short period after being hit by a bullet (known as the 'border between life and death') to avoid loss of a life. The amount of time the player has available to use the border is usually around 0.3 seconds. Bosses also have spell cards, but with bosses the term applies to a prolonged pattern of movements and shots that lasts until the player depletes the boss' health by a certain amount or the time runs out, not a one-shot attack.\n\nEach individual game of the main series from \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\" to \"Ten Desires\" has additional items that affect some aspect of gameplay, such as scoring or gaining extra lives/bombs. For example, \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\" has \"cherry points\", which are used mostly in scoring, but can grant temporary invulnerability (known as 'supernatural border'); \"Imperishable Night\" has \"time points\", which are essential for advancing to later stages, and also determine if the player gets to challenge a boss's 'final spell' on normal or higher difficulties; \"Mountain of Faith\" has 'faith' points, which boost the score the player receives upon gathering point items and bonuses for clearing spell cards without dying or using a spell card.\n\nEach \"Touhou\" game has four difficulty levels—easy, normal, hard, and lunatic—with each one being harder than the previous one. Regardless of difficulty choice, there are six stages in each game and each one is harder than the previous. The only exceptions to this are \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", and \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\" on easy difficulty, both of which only have five stages.\n\nIn addition to the four main difficulties, there is an extra stage which is a long and difficult stage in which players must play through hordes of enemies, and an especially long boss fight (usually with ten spell cards). In order to reach the extra stage, one must beat the game on normal difficulty or higher without the use of a continue. The only games that allow players to reach the extra stage by completing the easy difficulty are \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", \"Mystic Square\", \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\", \"Imperishable Night\", \"Fairy Wars\", \"Double Dealing Character\", \"Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom\", \"Hidden Star in Four Seasons\", and \"Wily Beast and Weakest Creature\". In terms of difficulty, the extra stage is around the normal difficulty level or above. In \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\", there is also a phantasm extra stage in which the enemies that were already difficult in the extra stage have become even more challenging. Although the phantasm stage is aimed for the most experienced players, the difficulty is somewhere in between hard and lunatic. The phantasm stage is accessed by beating the extra stage and capturing at least 60 spells with any of the characters and weapon types combined.\n\nThe plots of the \"Touhou Project\" revolve around the strange phenomena that occur in the fictional realm of , which ZUN designed with a human village in the grounds of some remote mountain recesses in Japan. Originally, it was simply called \"a remote separated land of a human village in an eastern country.\" Long before Touhou Project's story begins, there lived many non-humans like \"yōkai\" as well as some humans in the area. After a few humans lost their way into Gensokyo, humans became afraid of approaching this area, although others settled here for the sake of yōkai extermination. However, as time went on, humans developed civilization and multiplied in number, and thus the yōkai became distressed about how this would affect the balance between humans and yōkai. Thus, 500 years before \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\" (EoSD), the yōkai sage Yukari Yakumo developed the \"boundary of phantasm and substance,\" which was favored by the yōkai and protected the balance. This was called the \"Yōkai Expansion Project\" and made Gensokyo a phantasmal world that automatically called out to the weakened yōkai of the outside world. Other things that disappear from the outside world, like extinct animals, lost tools, and architecture, also became abundant in Gensokyo. Since Gensokyo was a plot of land in Japan that was separated by a barrier, it is Japan that is immediately outside of this barrier.\n\nAs a result of the seal, Gensokyo became inaccessible from the outside world, and similarly, those in Gensokyo were unable to leave. Gensokyo's existence could not be confirmed from the outside world, nor could the outside world be confirmed within Gensokyo. As a result, the isolated community developed its own civilization, different from that of the outside world. Although separated by a barrier, it is a bordering world to its outside, as opposed to being in a parallel universe. There are no seas in Gensokyo, since it is an inland mountain. In Gensokyo, there are few humans, and various kinds of yōkai. Some species include magicians, beasts, therianthropies, vampires, bōrei, tengu, mermaids, kappa, and yōkai (a kind of miscellaneous group). There are others species that could be yōkai depending on definition, like fairies, spirits, yūrei, onryō, poltergeists, hermits, oni, and gods which are all portrayed in human female form.\n\nIn present Gensokyo, which is presented in all \"Touhou Project\" games since EoSD, as opposed to the outside world where unscientific phenomena were dismissed as \"superstition\" by the time of the Meiji era, magical and spiritual qualities prevail. The only known gateway from the outside world into Gensokyo is the Hakurei Shrine on the border of Gensokyo. The spell card rules were also established to keep up the relationship between humans and yōkai in a mock style, which was necessary for the preservation of the balance of Gensokyo. The \"Great Hakurei Barrier,\" managed by Hakurei Miko, was constructed several decades before EoSD, which is described as a \"barrier of common sense,\" and is thus a strong logical barrier that not even yōkai can pass through. The yōkai were at first against its construction, but then gradually understood its usefulness.\n\nIn Gensokyo, events called \"incidents\" occur once in a while. An incident is an event that affects all of Gensokyo and is of unknown cause at the time it occurs. \"Touhou Project\" mainly focuses on incidents in its stories, but there are also works like \"Mountain of Faith\" that are about events other than incidents.\n\nFrequently, incidents are due to a yōkai's whim or curiosity, and usually Reimu Hakurei would go to investigate it and then find and chastise the perpetrator. Usually, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine resolves incidents, but there are cases where Marisa Kirisame and other imitators would resolve them. When a major incident occurs, the spirits and fairies are affected by the circumstances, the incident, and the perpetrator, and experience an increase in power for the duration incident, so there are also cases where a mere fairy defeats Reimu. It has additionally been stated that people of the village also go out to resolve incidents.\n\nWith its focus on bishōjo characters, the \"Touhou\" series possesses a large cast compared to other shooting games. While they aren't developed nearly to the standards of a story-based game, many players love them. One example is Hong Meiling, affectionately known as Chūgoku (China), the stage 3 boss of \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\", who won a popularity contest in Japan out of all \"Touhou\" characters. Among the vast array of characters, only six named characters are male. One (Genjii) is a turtle, one is a cat (Sokrates), two (Youki Konpaku and Myouren Hijiri) are only mentioned in passing, one (Rinnosuke Morichika) who is a merchant is only featured in the serialized novel, and the last (Unzan) is a cloud-like entity. There is also one before all these (Shingyoku), but this character has three forms of different genders, so this character may not exactly be male.\n\nThough each game features a collection of different characters, the main protagonist of the series is always Reimu Hakurei, joined by Marisa Kirisame after the second game. Exceptions to this include \"Shoot the Bullet\" and \"Double Spoiler\" (Aya Shameimaru is playable on both, and Hatate Himekaidou can become playable in \"Double Spoiler\"); \"Fairy Wars\" (which has Cirno as the sole playable character); \"Impossible Spell Card\" (where only Seija Kijin is playable); and \"Violet Detector\" (where only Sumireko Usami is playable).\n\nThe \"Touhou Project\" is a one-man project by Jun'ya Ōta (usually under the pseudonym ZUN), who does all the graphics, music, and programming alone for the bullet hell games, with the exceptions of the portrait art in \"Fairy Wars\", which is by Makoto Hirasaka, and the fighting games, \"Immaterial and Missing Power\", \"Scarlet Weather Rhapsody\", \"Touhou Hisōtensoku\", \"Hopeless Masquerade\", and \"Urban Legend in Limbo\", which were dual efforts with Twilight Frontier.\n\nThe idea of \"Touhou\" first came to ZUN during his high school years, when shrine maiden-themed games were in the minority. \"It would be nice to make shrine maiden games,\" he thought, and often imagined the music that would go with such games. He went to college, hoping to compose music for fighting games, since they were popular at the time due to \"Street Fighter II\". However, he decided that in order to put his music into games, it would be easier to make his own game to go with it, thus the first \"Touhou\" game, \"Highly Responsive to Prayers\", was released in 1996. The first game was originally intended as a practice in programming. \"Touhou\" only became a shooting game series starting from the second game, because the popularity of shooting games had revived due to \"RayForce\" and ZUN had long been a fan of such games. ZUN remarked how the general theme and direction of \"Touhou\" only started coming together in the sixth game, \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\".\n\nZUN develops his games with Visual Studio, Adobe Photoshop, and Cubase, according to his interview in \"Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red\".\n\nA prodigious number of derivative works based on \"Touhou\" have been created since the release of \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\". These include dōjinshi, dōjin music (many of the songs had been made remixing the original games' music), dōjin anime, and dōjin games (even though the \"Touhou\" games themselves are dōjin games). The vast scope of \"Touhou\" derivatives prompted commentary, noting that \"Touhou Project\" became an unmissable aspect of Japanese consumer generated media. These dōjin activities are mostly responsible for adding original attributes to characters that ZUN may not have intended. ZUN, for the most part, had acknowledged, appreciated, and even encouraged these derivative works by imposing very few restrictions on the use of his works. The major restrictions are on unauthorized commercial distribution (as opposed to dōjin) and the spoiling of endings; proper attribution to Team Shanghai Alice is a recommendation. ZUN stated himself that he did not want the \"Touhou Project\" game series to be officially commercialized.\nThe first recent publication of \"Touhou\" derivative doujinshi occurred during December 2003, following the release of \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\"; seven circles sold \"Touhou\" derivative works at Comiket 65 in December 2003. At the Comiket 74 in August 2008, a total of 885 circles had \"Touhou\" derivative works on display or for sale, out of a total of 35,000 circles participating at Comiket. At Comiket 77 (December 2009), 2,372 circles were dedicated to \"Touhou\", breaking the previous record held by \"The Prince of Tennis\" at Comiket 66 (August 2004), which had 2,130 circles. At Comiket 85 (December 2013), \"Touhou\" was still in the lead, with 2,272 participating circles selling \"Touhou\" derivatives, far outpacing those of other franchises.\n\nThe dōjin games based on \"Touhou\" include adaptations of other game series' mechanics with \"Touhou\" characters, such as \"Komajou Densetsu: Scarlet Symphony\" (a parody of the Castlevania games with the title being a play on the Japanese title of the series, \"Akumajō Dracula\"), \"Age of Ethanols\" (based on the \"Age of Empires\" series), and \"Touhou Puppet Dance Performance\" (based on the \"Pokémon\" games). The music of \"Touhou\" is also very popular and many arrangement CDs can be found for sale at Comiket and other Japanese conventions.\n\nAt Tokyo Game Show 2014, ZUN announced a collaborative project with PlayStation bringing unofficial, fan-made \"Touhou Project\" \"dōjin\" games to the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and PlayStation Vita platforms. As of September 2014, by Aqua Style, by Strawberry Bose and by Area-Zero have been announced for release on the PS4. The games will be published by Mediascape, under contract by Sony Computer Entertainment and ZUN, as part of a move towards embracing indie games for commercial distribution on PlayStation platforms.\n\nAmong the most popular derivatives are the series of Flash videos created by the dōjin music circle IOSYS. Many of them, one of which is \"Marisa Stole the Precious Thing,\" are popular on otaku internet forums and Nico Nico Douga.\n\nA short derivative animated project, was produced by Ufotable in celebration of the 10th anniversary of Japanese goods chain Animate as a promotional video for the store combining the world of \"Touhou\" with Animate's mascot, Meito Anizawa. Several fanmade anime have also been made for \"Touhou\". A dōjin anime project by the dōjin circle Maikaze, titled , is a fan-made anime adaptation with an original plot featuring \"Touhou\" characters, with four episodes released from 2008 to 2016, and the 2.5th episode released in 2014; the last episode will be released in 2020. Albeit created by an amateur studio, the project featured professional voice actors. Another dōjin anime by the circle Manpuku Jinja, titled (without voice dubbing but have background music and sound), was released at Comiket 80 in 2011, with one episode released based on the storyline of \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\", and there are 14 episodes as of 2019.\n\nKyoto Fantasy Troupe, a Chinese dōjin circle, made a dōjin anime titled \"Hifuu Club Activity Record ~ The Sealed Esoteric History\" (). The first episode was released at Comiket 89 in late 2015 and Chengdu TouhouOnly05 in early 2016, and it also featured professional Japanese voice actors when it was released again later. The second episode was released in 2017. Another Chinese dōjin circle, Perpetual Motion Niche, is also making a dōjin anime titled \"Secluded Magic Instrument~ Meteors of Triple Dimension\" (), which is about the story of the collision of three worlds—the forgotten Eastern Country (in the PC-98 games), Gensokyo (in the Windows games) and the outside world; the first episode was released in Q3 2017.\n\nThe \"Touhou Project\" was nominated for the 11th annual Media Arts Awards held by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs, under the Entertainment category, where \"Touhou Project\" eventually lost to Nintendo's \"Wii Sports\" for the Grand Prize award. The series was inducted into the Guinness World Records in October 2010 as the \"most prolific fan-made shooter series\".\n\nYuyuko Saigyouji and Reimu Hakurei also make cameo character appearances in Square Enix's game \"Lord of Vermilion Re:2\".\n\nA major Internet meme based on \"Touhou\" is , which centers around the disembodied, deformed heads of \"Touhou\" characters, often referred to as \"yukkuris\". This meme originated from a disfigured attempt to draw the main characters Reimu and Marisa with Shift JIS art. Yukkuris became so popular that the phrase \"Yukkuri shite itte ne!!!\" won bronze for 2008's \"Net Slang of the Year\" in Japan. Yukkuris also appear in Internet advertisements, the anime \"Natsu no Arashi!\" and \"Pani Poni Dash!\", and most notably, the front page of 2channel, the largest Internet forum in the world.\nThe is the largest of the many dōjin conventions hosting only \"Touhou\" content. Although the coordinator of this convention has nothing to do with Team Shanghai Alice officially, the name \"Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai\" was given by ZUN himself. It first started in the year 2004 as a way for Team Shanghai Alice to publicly distribute the trial version for their upcoming games to the fans well in advance of releasing them on the internet; in addition, the 2004 Reitaisai featured a total of 114 participating circles. Since then, many \"Touhou\" derivative works are also gathered and sold there. Commencing every year in April or May, the convention has been hosted in Ōta, Tokyo in 2004; Naka-ku, Yokohama in 2005; Sunshine City, Tokyo in 2006 and 2007; and the Tokyo Big Sight in 2008 and after. The year 2010 saw the birth of Reitaisai SP, an additional Reitaisai to be held every autumn due to increasing popularity, but Reitaisai SP was cancelled after 2011. The 2011 Reitaisai was originally cancelled due to safety concerns after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the release of \"Ten Desires\" was also postponed. It was later rescheduled and held on May 8, 2011, with approximately 4,940 participating circles. In addition to events in Japan, there is another Reitaisai held in Taiwan starting in 2015. The 17th Reitaisai in 2020, which was originally going to be held on March 22 and was later postponed to May 17, was ultimately cancelled due to safety concerns over the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, making it the first Reitaisai to be cancelled.<ref>\n"}

Until the 1829 Treaty of Lewistown, the community was the site of a Shawnee settlement. It is said to have been named in honor of “Captain” John Lewis, a Shawnee leader. Nearby Indian Lake was once known as the Lewistown Reservoir, after this settlement. Although it is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 43333. The population of the ZCTA for ZIP code 43333 was 693 at the 2000 census.\n\nThe area around Lewistown was populated by several Native American tribes resettled as a result of the Treaty of Fort Meigs. This treaty, signed on September 29, 1817 also provided for the University of Michigan, as well as other grants.\n\nIn the 1820s Lewistown was a village primarily inhabited by Seneca and Shawnee people. It was also the eastern point in a reservation for these groups that stretched westward to the headwaters of Loramie Creek.\n\nThe Treaty of Lewistown caused the resettlement of about 300 people to “the western side of the Mississippi river”, contiguous to lands reserved in previous treaties to Shawnee, Seneca, and Cherokee.\n\nDuring the residence of the Indians in Washington Township, as early as 1820, only few white men lived in the area. “They were doubtless squatters, and their stay brief, as no one knows anything of their subsequent history. In the summer of 1832, immediately following the departure of the Indians, a few white families came into the township and began settlement.” One of the first permanent settlers was Henry Hanford, a native of Connecticut. Till 1835 Hanford purchased of land in and around Lewistown.\n\nDaniel Conley, “the pioneer shoemaker in the place”, and Hanford's brother-in-law built the first frame house in the “village”. Later Henry Hanford opened a general store and became the first postmaster of Lewistown. Mail was delivered once a week. A semiweekly hack line ran from Bellefontaine to Anna Station, via Lewistown. In 1835 a mill was erected, followed by a steam sawmill. In 1840, a “tavern” (actually more of an inn) began operation in the community. A distillery followed in 1862, but was confiscated by the government when it failed to make tax returns. Till 1880 a tannery concluded the industries of the township.\n\nLewistown is located at (40.4222730, -83.8846598), at an altitude of 1,017 feet (310 m).\n\nThe community lies at the intersection of County Roads 54 and 91, a short distance south of State Route 274 and a short distance east of State Route 235.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 693 people, 255 households, and 193 families residing in the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for Lewistown's post office. There are 273 housing units in the ZCTA. The racial makeup of the ZCTA was 98.7% White, 0.1% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.0% from other races, and 0.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.4% of the population.\n\nThere were 255 households out of which 37.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.1% were married couples living together, 5.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.3% were non-families. 20.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.72 and the average family size was 3.12.\n\nIn the ZCTA the population was spread out with 25.8% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 31.8% from 25 to 44, 24.9% from 45 to 64, and 10.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.2 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the ZCTA was $36,534, and the median income for a family was $61,458. Males had a median income of $37,396 versus $20,363 for females. The per capita income for the ZCTA was $20,187. About 12.0% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.1% of those under age 18 and 11.1% of those age 65 or over.\n\nA school was founded in the community in 1833; this was one of the first school to be built in the lands north of the Greenville Treaty Line. Earlier schools were founded on the Connecticut Western Reserve in 1808, Columbia Township, and 1819, Elyria. This school was initially housed in a log cabin, but was moved to a frame building in 1840. The Lewistown special school district was founded in 1874; this district is now known as the Indian Lake Local Schools.\n\nFuture Los Angeles Dodgers manager Walter Alston once taught shop and coached basketball in the Lewistown building under an arrangement which left him free to participate in baseball with the Dodger minor league organization. When the school board finally asked him to choose between organizations, the future Baseball Hall of Fame member wisely picked the Dodgers for whom he managed major league teams in Brooklyn and Los Angeles for 23 seasons. Alston's former high school players were regular guests at Dodger games in Cincinnati, and he always introduced them to his current players as \"my first team.\" Although he never coached at the current Indian Lake High School, its gym honors his memory as the Walter Alston Gymnasium.\n\nThe Indian Lake Local Schools operate three schools in the northwestern part of Logan County. Indian Lake Elementary School, Indian Lake Middle School and Indian Lake High School are located close enough to Lewistown to be served by the post office there (ZIP code: 43333).\n\n"}

{"id": "1952281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952281", "title": "Porchetta", "text": "Porchetta\n\nPorchetta () is a savory, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast of Italian culinary tradition. The carcass is deboned, arranged carefully stuffed with liver, wild fennel, all fat and skin still on spitted, and/or roasted, traditionally over wood for at least 8 hours. Porchetta is usually heavily salted in addition to being stuffed with garlic, rosemary, fennel, or other herbs, often wild. Porchetta has been selected by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy as a \"prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale\" (“traditional agricultural-food product”, one of a list of traditional Italian foods held to have cultural relevance).\n\nAlthough popular in the whole country, porchetta originated in central Italy, with Ariccia (in the Province of Rome) being the town most closely associated with it. Elsewhere, it is considered a celebratory dish. Across Italy, porchetta is usually sold by pitchmen with their typically white-painted vans, especially during public displays or holidays, and it can be served in a panino. It's a common street food in Rome and Lazio served as a filling for pizza bianca. It is also eaten as a meat dish in many households or as part of a picnic.\n\nPorchetta is one of the two iconic culinary products of the Lazio region, the other being the sheep cheese pecorino romano. Porchetta is also common in Abruzzo. \"Porchetta abruzzese\" is generally slow roasted with rosemary, garlic, and pepper. Porchetta from Umbria is stuffed with the pig's chopped entrails mixed with lard, garlic, salt and plenty of pepper and wild fennel.\n\nPorchetta \"trevigiana\" (from Treviso) was developed in 1919. In it, a pig is slaughtered when one year old, and then its meat is stuffed with salt, pepper, wild fennel, garlic and white wine. It is then roasted inside an oven for seven hours at . The porchetta is today a popular dish in Venetian cuisine.\n\nThe dish is also a staple of Sardinian cuisine. There it is known as \"porceddu\" and is roasted over juniper and myrtle wood fires.\n\nPorchetta was introduced to the United States by Italian immigrants of the early 20th century, especially immigrants from Abruzzo, and is sometimes referred to as \"Italian pulled pork,\" \"roast pork,\" or \"Italian roast pork.\" It is, in many places, served on a sandwich with greens (rapini or spinach) and provolone cheese.\n\nIn Philadelphia and the surrounding area, the dish is usually referred to as simply \"roast pork,\" \"roast pork sandwich,\" \"Italian roast pork,\" \"roast pork Italian,\" \"roasted pork,\" or \"porchetta.\" Philadelphia cuisine is noted for its sandwich form of porchetta, usually served on an Italian roll and often with broccoli rabe instead of spinach and most traditionally with locally made sharp provolone. \"Roast pork\" is a staple of Philadelphia Italian-American and South Philadelphia cuisine, with restaurants such as DiNic's Roast Pork in the Reading Terminal Market and John's Roast Pork, Esposito's Porchetta, and Tony Luke's in South Philadelphia being well known for their porchetta or \"roast pork\" sandwiches.\n\nBridgeport, Connecticut, has a Saturday afternoon lunch tradition of porchetta sandwiches served at community restaurants and taverns that dates back to the first wave of Italian immigration in the early 20th century. The dish is served with pepperoncini.\n\nThe porchetta and roast beef sandwich traditions are celebrated in the form of an annual bus tour every first Saturday in March in Bridgeport, Connecticut, organized by The Porchetta Project.\n\nMetro West Massachusetts has a fierce following of prochettas. Local organizations often hold Porchetta Dinners as fund raisers which are very popular and well attended. Many local shops make roast for purchase, cooked or uncooked. Notable areas are Milford and Framingham Massachusetts as they both have large Italian populations. The spices used can vary greatly within this area, some will go full bore with garlic, black pepper, salt, fennel, rosemary, and sage, others will use only garlic, salt, pepper, and fennel. The stem of the fennel plant is often substituted for the fennel seed. These local roasts are made from the Boston butt, or shoulder of the pig.\n\nPorchetta is also very popular in the Northern Ontario (notably Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie) and Southern Ontario (in areas such as Hamilton and St. Catharines), and the term \"porchetta\" is widely used by Italian-Canadians, instead of simply \"roast pork\". Porchetta (sometimes spelled \"porketta\") is also popular in the Upper Midwest, having been brought to the Michigan and Minnesota Iron ranges by Italian immigrants.\n\nThe porchetta culture in Sudbury runs perhaps deeper than anywhere outside of its native Italy. Italian settlers passed on their love for porchetta to their children and friends in this region. Old family secrets of spicing, rolling and roasting are passed on, extending commercially into butcher shops as well as in the form of fast-food sandwiches offered in various locally owned shops. \"Porketta Bingo\", a variation on the traditional Canadian meat draw, is a popular Saturday afternoon activity in Sudbury. Game winners receive one pound of porchetta and a sourdough bun. There are usually between four and seven rounds of six games each, depending on the establishment. Proceeds of Porketta Bingo usually go to a local charity or are donated to local hockey associations.\n\n"}

Jannali is located 28 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. The majority of land use in Jannali is residential and bushland reserve, while the suburb is bisected by the north-south railway line. The majority of Jannali's enterprises are located close to the suburb's railway station.\n\nJannali is an Aboriginal word, meaning \"the Place of the Moon\", originating from an unknown language as recorded by George Thornton. The Dharug language word for the Moon is 'yanada', and Jannali may be an alternative Anglicization of this.\n\nThe area began to develop with the arrival of the railway line in 1884. However, the railway station at Jannali was not built until 1931. The department of railways paid for the construction of the railway station and ramps while the local council paid for the road bridge over the line at the southern end of the station. This attracted residents to the suburb and many more homes were built after World War II when blocks of land were offered to returned servicemen.\n\nJannali had a 10-court squash centre between 1978 and 2001. The building has been demolished and offices and apartments built on the site. During the existence of the squash centre, Jannali Squash Club, who leased courts at the centre, produced many players of first grade standard and in the mid-1980s was considered Sydney's leading Squash Club and one of the strongest in Australia. \n\nJannali railway station is on the Illawarra line of the Sydney Trains network. Access to the platform for city-bound trains and the railway ticket office is off Janalli Avenue, while access to platform for south-bound trains is off Railway Crescent.\n\nTransdev NSW buses (routes 967 and 968) link Jannali to Miranda, Oyster Bay, Kareela, Como West and Bonnet Bay.\n\nShops and commercial businesses provide a broad range of services to the Jannali community. Most are centred on the main transport hub of the railway station and the bridge over the railway line. This bridge provides the only link for both automotive and pedestrian movement between the eastern and western portions of the Jannali community.\n\nWhile the majority of enterprises are located on the eastern side of the railway line, i.e., along Railway Crescent and Box Road, further enterprises are located in White Street (off Railway Crescent). A small group of business are situated in Jannali Avenue on the western side of the railway line, as is Sutherland Shire Council's Kurranulla Aboriginal Resources Centre and the community hall.\n\nThe residential streets feature many houses, units and local reserves which contain a diversity of flora and fauna. Jannali Reserve is a large recreational area on the western border. Playgrounds in the area include Charles Orwin Reserve (2 Davey Street, Jannali) and Alice Street Reserve (8 Alice Street, Jannali).\n\nThe suburb has three public schools: the Jannali High School, Jannali Public School & Jannali East Public School. The Jannali High School was formed in 1992 from the amalgamation of Jannali Girls' High School (1953) and Jannali Boys' High School (1956). Jannali East primary opened in 1956.\n\nThe St George & Sutherland Community College (SGSCC) is housed in the former Jannali Girls High School grounds.

The local rugby league team is the Como-Jannali Crocodiles who are based at Scylla Bay Oval in nearby Como.\n\nAs part of the boom in Squash in the late 1970s, on 30 October 1978, a new, state-of-the-art squash centre was opened by local Member of Parliament. Maurie Keane at 48-54 Railway Crescent. The centre featured 10 competition squash courts, a gymnasium, and sports therapist underneath. The centre closed in 2001, the squash boom having long ended, however during its time, the Jannali Squash Club rose to be one of the strongest in the country, winning several men's and women's first grade premierships and at times reaching over 200 playing members from Jannali and neighbouring suburbs.\nIn the 2016 Census, there were 6,184 people in Jannali. 75.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.0%, and China 2.2%. 82.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 1.9%.The top responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 27.2%, No Religion 26.9% and Anglican 20.1%.

He served 52 months of a 66-month sentence in U.S. federal prison, from April 2008 to August 2012. Ford resigned from the Tennessee State Senate on May 28, 2005, in a letter to Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, John S. Wilder.\n\nSix of Ford family patriarch N. J. Ford's sons and one daughter have been active in elective politics:\n\n\nFord grew up with 11 brothers and sisters on Horn Lake Road in the West Junction neighborhood of South Memphis and graduated from Geeter High School in 1960.

Hindu culture arrived in 1845 in Trinidad and Tobago. In the 21st century, pro Hindu parties were elected. In the 2011 census, There are 240,100 declared Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago. There are also various temples in Trinidad and Tobago to accommodate Hindus.\n\nA decade after slavery was abolished in 1834, the British government gave permission for the colonists to import indentured labor from India to work on the estates. Throughout the remainder of the century, Trinidad's population growth came primarily from Indian laborers. By 1871, there were 27,425 Indians, approximately 22 percent of the population of Trinidad and Tobago; by 1911 that figure had grown to 110,911, or about 33 percent of all residents of the islands.\n\nDuring the initial decades of Indian indenture, Indian cultural forms were met with either contempt or indifference by the non-Hindu majority. Hindus have made many contributions to Trinidad history and culture even though the state historically regarded Hindus as second class citizens. Hindus in Trinidad struggled over the granting of adult franchise, the Hindu marriage bill, the divorce bill, cremation ordinance, and others. Cremation was allowed in 1953.\nThere has been persistent discontent among the Hindus with their marginalization. Many groups portray Hindus as \"clannish, backward and miserly\". During the General Elections of 1986, the absence of the Bhagvad Gita and the Quran at polling stations for required oath-taking was interpreted as a gross insult to Hindus and Muslims. The absence of any Hindu religious texts at the official residence of the President of Trinidad and Tobago during the swearing in of the new Government in 1986 was perceived as another insult to the minority communities since they were represented in the government. The national education system and curriculum have been repeatedly accused of such majority-oriented symbolism. The use of discernibly oriented prayers at Government schools, the non-representation of Hinduism in approved school textbooks, and the lack of emphasis on Hindu religious observance evoked deep resentment from the Hindu community. Intensified protests over the course of the 1980s led to an improvement in the state's attitudes towards Hindus.\n\nThe divergence of some of the fundamental aspects of local Hindu culture, the segregation of the Hindu community from Trinidad, and the disinclination to risk erasing the more fundamental aspects of what had been constructed as \"Trinidad Hinduism\" in which the identity of the group had been rooted, would often generate dissension when certain dimensions of Hindu culture came into contact with the State. While the incongruousness continue to generate debate, and often conflict, it is now tempered with growing awareness and consideration on the part of the state to the Hindu minority. Hindus have been also been subjected to conversions by Christian missionaries, specifically the evangelical and Pentecostal Christians. Such activities reflect racial tensions that at times arise between the Afro-Trinidadian and Indo-Trinidadian communities.\n\nAs per the 2011 Census, there were 240,100 Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago. Out of this, 232,104 were Indian, 2,738 were Dougla (mixed African/Indian), 2,466 were Mixed/Other, 1,887 Unknown ethnicity, 346 African, 175 Chinese, 27 European, 302 Indigenous Amerindian, 46 Other, and 8 Portuguese. Talking about the proportion within the ethnic groups, 49.54% of the East Indians and 21.66% of the Indigenous were Hindu.

Considerations of caste became less important in choosing a spouse largely because there were so few women among the Indian indentured workers.\n\nCremation is permitted at three cremation sites in Mafeking (Mayaro-Rio Claro), South Oropouche (Siparia) and Waterloo (Couva-Tabaquite-Talparo).\n\n\n"}

The legislature convenes in the State Capitol building in Harrisburg. In colonial times (1682–1776), the legislature was known as the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly and was unicameral. Since the Constitution of 1776, the legislature has been known as the General Assembly. The General Assembly became a bicameral legislature in 1791.\n\nThe General Assembly has 253 members, consisting of a Senate with 50 members and a House of Representatives with 203 members, making it the second-largest state legislature in the nation (behind New Hampshire) and the largest full-time legislature. \n\nSenators are elected for a term of four years. Representatives are elected for a term of two years. The Pennsylvania general elections are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years. A vacant seat must be filled by special election, the date of which is set by the presiding officer of the respective house.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years old, and Representatives at least 21 years old. They must be citizens and residents of the state for a minimum of four years and reside in their districts for at least one year. Individuals who have been convicted of felonies, including embezzlement, bribery, and perjury, are ineligible for election; the state Constitution also adds the category of \"other infamous crimes,\" which can be broadly interpreted by state courts. No one who has been previously expelled from the General Assembly may be elected.\n\nLegislative districts are drawn every ten years, following the U.S. Census. Districts are drawn by a five-member commission, of which four members are the majority and minority leaders of each house (or their delegates). The fifth member, who chairs the committee, is appointed by the other four and may not be an elected or appointed official. If the leadership cannot decide on a fifth member, the State Supreme Court may appoint him or her.\n\nWhile in office, legislators may not hold civil office. Even if a member resigns, the Constitution states that he or she may not be appointed to civil office for the duration of the original term for which he or she was originally elected.\n\nThe General Assembly is a continuing body within the term for which its representatives are elected. It convenes at 12 o'clock noon on the first Tuesday of January each year and then meets regularly throughout the year.

Unfortunately, the amendment (today found at Section 3 of Article III of the Pennsylvania Constitution) was so poorly written that it also prevented the General Assembly from undertaking a comprehensive codification of the Commonwealth's statutes until another amendment was pushed through in 1967 to provide the necessary exception. This is why today, Pennsylvania is the only U.S. state that has not yet completed a comprehensive codification of its general statutory law. Pennsylvania is currently undertaking its first official codification process in the \"Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes\".\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives: Mike Turzai (R) \n\nPresident pro tem of the Senate: Joseph B.

He is known best for his 1975 internationally successful song \"The Hustle\". He has approximately 700 song copyrights to his credit, and is also noted for producing songs for such recording artists as Gladys Knight & the Pips, The Stylistics, Aretha Franklin, Brenda & the Tabulations, David Ruffin, Peaches & Herb, Lesley Gore and Stacy Lattisaw.\n\nVan McCoy was born in Washington, D.C., the second child of Norman S. McCoy, Sr. and Lillian Ray. He learned to play piano at a young age and sang with the Metropolitan Baptist Church choir as a youngster.\n\nBy the age of 12, he had begun writing his own songs, in addition to performing in local amateur shows alongside his older brother, Norman Jr. The two brothers formed a doo-wop combo named the Starlighters with two friends while in Theodore Roosevelt High School. In 1956 they recorded a single entitled, \"The Birdland\", a novelty dance record. It gained some interest, resulting in a tour with drummer Vi Burnsides. In 1959 the Starlighters produced three singles for End Records that included \"I Cried\". Marriage and other commitments eventually caused the group to disband during the mid-1950s. Van also sang with a group called the Marylanders.\n\nDuring 1961, McCoy met Kendra Spotswood (also known as Sandi Sheldon) who lived near his family. For the next five years, they sang and recorded music together professionally. Their relationship ended when McCoy delayed their wedding plans because of a work contract he had signed with Columbia Records.\n\nIn September 1958, McCoy entered Howard University to study psychology but dropped out after two years to relocate to Philadelphia, where he formed his own recording company, Rockin' Records, releasing his first single, \"Hey Mr. DJ,\" in 1959. This single gained the attention of Scepter Records owner Florence Greenberg, who hired McCoy as a staff writer and A&R representative for the label. As a writer there, McCoy composed his first success, \"Stop the Music,\" for the popular female vocal group, The Shirelles in 1962. He was co-owner of Vando Records with Philly D.J. Jocko Henderson. He owned Share label and co-owned the Maxx label in the mid-1960s, supervising such artists as Gladys Knight & The Pips, Chris Bartley and The Ad Libs.\n\nHe came into his own after first working for top producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as a writer and then signing with the major April-Blackwood music publishing concern, connected with Columbia Records. McCoy went on to write a string of hits as the 1960s progressed. He penned \"Giving Up\" for Gladys Knight & the Pips (later a hit for both The Ad Libs and Donny Hathaway), \"The Sweetest Thing This Side of Heaven\" for Chris Bartley, \"When You're Young and in Love\" for Ruby & the Romantics (later a hit for The Marvelettes), \"Right on the Tip of My Tongue\" for Brenda & the Tabulations, \"Baby I'm Yours\" for Barbara Lewis, \"Getting Mighty Crowded\" for Betty Everett, \"Abracadabra\" for Erma Franklin, \"You're Gonna Make Me Love You\" for Sandi Sheldon and \"I Get the Sweetest Feeling\" for Jackie Wilson. He also put together the hit-making duo of Peaches & Herb, arranging and co-producing their first hit, \"Let's Fall in Love,\" for the Columbia subsidiary Date in 1966. The same year, McCoy recorded a solo LP for Columbia entitled \"Night Time Is Lonely Time\", and, a year later, started his own short-lived label, Vando, as well as his own production company VMP (Van McCoy Productions).\n\nVan wrote or produced most consistently for The Presidents (\"5-10-15-20 (25-30 Years of Love)\"), The Choice Four (\"The Finger Pointers,\" \"Come Down to Earth\"), Faith, Hope & Charity (\"To Each His Own\" and \"Life Goes On\") and David Ruffin (\"Walk Away from Love\"). In the early 1970s, McCoy began a long, acclaimed collaboration with songwriter/producer Charles Kipps and arranged several hits for the soul group The Stylistics as well as releasing his own solo LP on the Buddah label, \"Soul Improvisations\", in 1972. The album included a minor hit, \"Let Me Down Easy,\" but it was not a success following poor promotion. Following his success with \"The Hustle\", it was re-released in abridged form (two songs less) as \"From Disco to Love.\" He formed his own orchestra, Soul City Symphony and, with singers Faith, Hope and Charity, produced several albums and gave many performances.\n\nVan McCoy appeared on the \"Mike Douglas Show\" and was a regular guest on \"The Tonight Show\". He wrote and sang the theme song for the 1978 movie \"Sextette\" that starred Mae West and Timothy Dalton and made a cameo appearance in it, playing a delegate from Africa. He also contributed some music for \"A Woman Called Moses\". Along with Faith Hope & Charity, Brass Construction and Johnny Dark, he appeared in episode 4.20 of Don Kirshner's \"Rock Concert\".\n\nIn 1975, McCoy released to low expectations the mostly instrumental LP \"Disco Baby\" for the Avco (later H&L) label. The title song, \"Disco Baby\", was written by George David Weiss, Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, and was also performed by The Stylistics for their 1975 album \"Thank You Baby\". Unexpectedly, a single called \"The Hustle\" from the album, written about the dance of the same name and recorded last for the album, went to the top of both the \"Billboard\" pop and R&B charts (also No. 3 in the UK) and won a Grammy Award. The album was also nominated for a Grammy. McCoy, then regarded as a disco hitmaker, never repeated the success of the song, although the singles \"Party\", \"That's the Joint\" and \"Change with the Times\" got significant airplay. The latter reached No. 6 in the \"Billboard\" R&B chart and was a Top 40 hit in the UK. There were no further major sellers in the US, despite a series of follow-up albums, \"From Disco to Love\" (the abridged 1975 reissue of \"Soul Improvisations\"), \"The Disco Kid\" (1975), \"The Real McCoy\" (1976), \"Rhythms of the World\" (1976), \"My Favorite Fantasy\" (1978), \"Lonely Dancer\" (1979) and \"Sweet Rhythm\" (1979). However, he scored the UK top 5 again during 1977 with the instrumental success \"The Shuffle\". which became the theme tune for BBC Radio 4's \"Sport on Four.\"\n\nMcCoy also had success with David Ruffin's comeback album, \"Who I Am\", featuring \"Walk Away from Love\", (US#9, US#1 R&B) in the US and a UK Top 5 success. He went on to produce the next two albums for Ruffin, which spawned further successes. McCoy produced Gladys Knight & the Pips' \"Still Together\" LP, and for Melba Moore (\"This Is It\" and \"Lean on Me\"). He discovered Faith, Hope And Charity, whose major success in 1975, \"To Each His Own\", was another R&B chart-topper. In 1975 he also arranged two of his compositions \"My Heart's too Big for my Head\" and \"You've Got to Tell Her\" for the Asha Puthli album \"She Loves to Hear the Music\".\n\nMcCoy died from a heart attack in Englewood, New Jersey, on July 6, 1979, at the age of 39. He is buried in the McCoy family plot at Lincoln Cemetery, Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Van McCoy among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n"}

The Pact was not ratified by the French Parliament.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Great Depression and the Nazi rise to power, Benito Mussolini called for the creation of the Four-Power Pact on March 19, 1933 as a better means of insuring international security. Under the plan, smaller nations would have less of a voice in great power politics. Representatives of Britain, France, Germany and Italy signed a diluted version of Mussolini's Four-Power Pact proposal. Mussolini's chief motive in suggesting the Pact was the wish for closer relations with France. Though Mussolini's purpose may have been to calm Europe's nerves, the Pact actually caused the opposite result. The treaty reaffirmed each country's adherence to the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Locarno Treaties and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n\nThe Pact was intended to be the solution to the issue of sovereign powers coming together and operate in an orderly way, which had been the purpose of the League of Nations. Mussolini's goal was to reduce the power of the small states in the League of Nations by a bloc of major powers.\n\nThe Four-Power Pact had little significance but was not completely devoid of merit. The Four-Power Pact was supposed to be a solution to the exploitation of the balance of power, which was of interest to Italy and appealed to the British as well.\n\nHowever, the\nPact faced speculation in France and Germany since London and Rome were close enough to mediate between Paris and Berlin. Therefore, France was justifiably alarmed.\n\nThe document that was signed bore little resemblance to the initial proposal. In practice, the Four-Power Pact proved of little significance in international affairs, but it was one of the factors contributing to the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934.\n\nIt has been argued that the Four-Power Pact could have safeguarded the European balance of power with the hope of balancing peace and security in Europe. However, the Great Depression was abundant in Europe, and the rise of Hitler to power also makes the ides unlikely. Poland's reliance on France had been weakened, and differing attitudes emerged of the pact between Poland and Czechoslovakia. Opposition to the revision of the Four-Power Pact was expressed by Poland and the Little Entente, as apparent in the French dilution of the pact in this final form. It is apparent that the Four-Power pact had a negative impact of France's allies in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe rise of Adolf Hitler to power was an adequate reason to propose alternative power arrangements. However, what had started as an alternative to the League of Nations ended as a reassertion of devotion to that failing institution. Hitler was willing to accept the gratuitous triumph of the League of Nation's death. The pact soon failed, but Britain, in particular, did not easily throw away the Pact's idea. Germany's withdrawal from the League put the Pact on hold.\n\nThe Pact had major impact on modern law. For six years, Britain would make vain attempts to make it work at nearly any cost, but the failure of the Four-Power Pact served as a warning of Germany's continued withdrawal from diplomatic relations with France and Britain in the buildup to the Second World War.\n\n\n"}

It covers and sits in a drainage basin. It was created by the construction of Seeger Dam on the Nicasio Creek in 1961. Seeger Dam is a tall, long earthen dam owned by the Marin Municipal Water District.\n\nThe construction in the dam aroused much controversy among longtime residents of the area. The Water District forced the displacement of many farms, including the McIsaac family farm and the Tomasini Ranch, on which the majority of the reservoir sits. The controversy stems from the fact the water from the reservoir is rarely used by the Water District, that the broad and shallow nature of the reservoir leads to quick evaporation, and that the dam has blocked valuable spawning areas for endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead trout. Construction of Seeger Dam wiped out the salmon population in Nicasio Creek. The District briefly attempted to trap salmon below the dam and transport them by truck further up Nicasio Creek and Halleck Creek. However, the effort proved unsuccessful.\n\nA river otter (\"Lontra canadensis\") was collected by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the southwest corner of Nicasio Reservoir in January, 2008.\n\nThe reservoir is used for recreational purposes; mainly fishing and hiking.

It can be used to separate two objects or portions of an object, lift up an object, or hold an object in place. It functions by converting a force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular (normal) to its inclined surfaces. The mechanical advantage of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width. Although a short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster, it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle.\n\nThe force is applied on a flat, broad surface. This energy is transported to the pointy, sharp end of the wedge, hence the force is transported.\n\nThe wedge simply transports energy and collects it to the pointy end, consequently breaking the item. In this way, much pressure is put on a thin area.\n\nPerhaps the first example of a wedge is the hand axe, also see biface and Olorgesailie. Wedges have existed for thousands of years, they were first made of simple stone. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece. The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement. This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed. For a wedge this is given by 1/tanα, where α is the tip angle. The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or prismatic joint.\n\nThe origin of the wedge is not known. In ancient Egyptian quarries, bronze wedges were used to break away blocks of stone used in construction. Wooden wedges that swelled after being saturated with water, were also used. Some indigenous peoples of the Americas used antler wedges for splitting and working wood to make canoes, dwellings and other objects.\n\nWedges are used to lift heavy objects, separating them from the surface upon which they rest.\n\nConsider a block that is to be lifted by a wedge. As the wedge slides under the block, the block slides up the sloped side of a wedge. This lifts the weight \"F\" of the block. The horizontal force \"F\" needed to lift the block is obtained by considering the velocity of the wedge \"v\" and the velocity of the block \"v\". If we assume the wedge does not dissipate or store energy, then the power into the wedge equals the power out.\n\nor\nThe velocity of the block is related to the velocity of the wedge by the slope of the side of the wedge. If the angle of the wedge is \"α\" then\nwhich means that the mechanical advantage\nThus, the smaller the angle \"α\" the greater the ratio of the lifting force to the applied force on the wedge. This is the mechanical advantage of the wedge. This formula for mechanical advantage applies to cutting edges and splitting operations as well as to lifting.\n\nThey can also be used to separate objects, such as blocks of cut stone. Splitting mauls and splitting wedges are used to split wood along the grain. A narrow wedge with a relatively long taper used to finely adjust the distance between objects is called a shim, and is commonly used in carpentry.\n\nThe tips of forks and nails are also wedges, as they split and separate the material into which they are pushed or driven; the shafts may then hold fast due to friction.\n\nThe blade is a compound inclined plane, consisting of two inclined planes placed so that the planes meet at one edge. When the edge where the two planes meet is pushed into a solid or fluid substance it overcomes the resistance of materials to separate by transferring the force exerted against the material into two opposing forces normal to the faces of the blade.\n\nThe blade's first known use by humans was the sharp edge of a flint stone that was used to cleave or split animal tissue, e.g. cutting meat. The use of iron or other metals led to the development of knives for those kinds of tasks. The blade of the knife allowed humans to cut meat, fibers, and other plant and animal materials with much less force than it would take to tear them apart by simply pulling with their hands. Other examples are plows, which separate soil particles, scissors which separate fabric, axes which separate wood fibers, and chisels and planes which separate wood.\n\nWedges, saws and chisels can separate thick and hard materials, such as wood, solid stone and hard metals and they do so with much less force, waste of material, and with more precision, than crushing, which is the application of the same force over a wider area of the material to be separated.\n\nOther examples of wedges are found in drill bits, which produce circular holes in solids. The two edges of a drill bit are sharpened, at opposing angles, into a point and that edge is wound around the shaft of the drill bit. When the drill bit spins on its axis of rotation, the wedges are forced into the material to be separated. The resulting cut in the material is in the direction of rotation of the drill bit while the helical shape of a bit allows the removal of the cut material.\n\nWedges can also be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and eccentric bottom brackets), and doors. A wedge-type door stop (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated by dividing the height of the wedge by the wedge's width:\n\nThe more acute, or narrow, the angle of a wedge, the greater the ratio of the length of its slope to its width, and thus the more mechanical advantage it will yield.\n\nA wedge will bind when the wedge included angle is less than the arctangent of the coefficient of friction between the wedge and the material. Therefore, in an elastic material such as wood, friction may bind a narrow wedge more easily than a wide one. This is why the head of a splitting maul has a much wider angle than that of an axe.\n\n"}

He worked for Admiral Chester Nimitz in the Pacific. Roberts was on the first plane to enter the eye of a tropical system near the Philippines. This method is still used today by the \"Hurricane Hunters\" of the Air Force based at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi to measure and record internal conditions in hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean to help predict their development and path.\n\nOn October 1, 1951, he began broadcasting on WDSU-TV. Roberts was the first full-time weathercaster in the Deep South and one of the first to use radar on television weather broadcasts.\n\nRoberts continued as a local forecaster on New Orleans television and radio. His calm guidance during these storms made him legendary to people throughout southeast Louisiana. He was the only local forecaster to accurately predict the paths of Hurricane Betsy in 1965, which hit the New Orleans area directly, and Hurricane Camille in 1969, a storm that devastated coastal Mississippi.\n\nAfter departing WDSU in November 1973, he moved to then-new Newscene 8 at WVUE-TV in January 1974 for 4 years, then to Eyewitness News at WWL-TV on March 20, 1978. As he aged, he gradually cut back his schedule, giving most of the day-to-day weathercasting chores to younger meteorologists Al Duckworth, who had been at WWL since becoming its first chief meteorologist in July 1968, and Dave Barnes.\n\nIn later years, Roberts was the favorite forecaster in the area, especially among older viewers, to the point where competitors good-naturedly referred to him as \"the Weather God\". After his retirement, he would be brought back as a special consultant when hurricanes threatened in the Gulf. By the late 1980s he seemed to many like a figure from an earlier era, as he eschewed computer graphics and other modern special effects in favor of a simple black marker and paper map. Nash retired from the Eyewitness News anchor desk in February 1984, but would come back during storms to help calm and educate the locals during hurricane season, sometimes to the visible resentment of the station's younger weathermen, especially when Nash's experience, intuition, and pen and paper yielded more accurate predictions than their computer models. He accurately predicted the path of Hurricane Georges in 1998, while all the full-time on-air meteorologists of the area, namely Bob Breck of WVUE and Dan Milham of WDSU, predicted an incorrect track.\n\nRoberts finally retired from even his special hurricane appearances in July 2001 (in part to help take care of his wife of over 60 years, Lydia), and that same year donated his papers to Loyola University, New Orleans.\n\nHe was fully retired, and had not been seen on TV in several years by 2006. Roberts and his wife evacuated in advance of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the first time he had left town for a hurricane. Roberts figures prominently in a 2006 book about Hurricane Camille, \"Roar Of The Heavens,\" by Stefan Bechtel.\n\nLydia and Nash Roberts had two sons, four grandchildren and six great grandchildren. Lydia Roberts died in June 2007; Nash himself died December 18, 2010 after a lengthy illness at age 92.\n\n"}

{"id": "1952399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952399", "title": "Wedge (golf)", "text": "Wedge (golf)\n\nIn the sport of golf, a wedge is a subset of the iron family of golf clubs designed for special use situations. As a class, wedges have the highest lofts, the shortest shafts, and the heaviest clubheads of the irons. These features generally aid the player in making accurate short-distance \"lob\" shots, to get the ball onto the green or out of a hazard or other tricky spot. In addition, wedges are designed with modified soles that aid the player in moving the clubhead through soft lies, such as sand, mud, and thick grass, to extract a ball that is embedded or even buried. Wedges come in a variety of configurations, and are generally grouped into four categories: pitching wedges, sand wedges, gap/approach wedges and lob wedges.\n\nThe class of wedges grew out of the need for a better club for playing soft lies and short shots. Prior to the 1930s, the best club for short \"approach\" shots was the \"niblick\", roughly equivalent to today's 9-iron or pitching wedge in loft; however the design of this club, with a flat, angled face and virtually no \"sole\", made it difficult to use in sand and other soft lies as it was prone to dig into soft turf. The club most often used for bunker shots was called the \"jigger\"; it was used similarly to today's pitching wedge, and had a similar short shaft, but its loft was closer to the \"mashie\" of the day (equivalent to today's 4-iron). The lower loft prevented the club \"digging in\" to soft lies, but the low launch angle and relatively high resistance to the club moving through the sand to \"dig out\" a buried ball made recovery from a bunker with this club very difficult. The club was also not ideal for approach shots from a bunker near the green, as a chip shot made with this club tended to roll for most of its distance.\n\nThe modern sand wedge, the first of the clubs to be called a wedge, was developed by Gene Sarazen after flying in Howard Hughes' private plane. Sarazen noticed the flaps on the wings that were lowered on takeoff to help create lift, and surmised that the same could be done to a high-lofted golf club to help the clubhead cut through and then lift out of the sand (bringing the ball with it). He built his first prototype in 1931 by taking a niblick and soldering extra lead to its sole to add mass, then adjusting the angle of the sole to about 10 degrees from level with the ground, which he found to be the optimal angle to prevent the clubhead either digging deeply into the sand or skimming (bouncing) along the top. The resulting clubhead profile was roughly wedge-shaped as opposed to the blade-like style of high-lofted irons, hence the name. He brought his new club to compete in the 1932 British Open, but kept it hidden from the authorities to avoid having it ruled illegal. He won that tournament with a then-record score of 283 (the sum of four rounds of play), and also won the subsequent 1932 U.S. Open with a final-round score of 66 that would stand as a tournament record for almost 30 years.\n\nSarazen's new club, including the wide, angled sole, was ruled legal by both R&A and USGA authorities, and the club itself and its basic design concepts became widely copied by other golfers and by club manufacturers. As irons became more standardized in the 20s through the 40s, the wide sole of the sand wedge was copied on other mid- and high-lofted irons to add mass, which compensates for the progressively shorter shaft lengths to provide a similar feel across all the irons with a given swing. The highest-lofted irons got the most additional weight, resulting in the widest soles, giving these clubs the same eponymous wedge-shaped profile as the sand wedge. This led to the tradition of calling these high-lofted irons \"wedges\", regardless of the amount of bounce (angle of the sole to the ground) that the sole provided.\n\nWedges, and the golfer's \"short game\", have come to be emphasized by pro players and teachers/coaches as an area of critical importance. By simple math, with par for a hole based on 2 putts, and at least one additional stroke needed to get the ball on the green, a scratch golfer will take up to 54 strokes on a typical par-72 course with the intention of getting on the green and/or in the hole; only about a third of the strokes taken in a round will be with a wood or long iron with the main intent being distance. In cases where the player doesn't make \"green in regulation\" (meaning the ball is not on the green with two strokes left for putts), shots normally taken as putts must instead be used to approach, and so must be very accurate in direction and distance in order to set the ball up for a one-putt par (the chip shot and putt combination is called an \"up and down\") or even a birdie or eagle made with the chip shot itself. Even touring professionals miss an average of 6 GIRs in a round, making chip shots and other close-in strokes typically made with wedges that much more important.\n\nAs a result, since the mid-80s the number of wedges available to players has grown from 2 (pitching and sand) to 5 (adding gap, lob and ultra lob), most of which are now available in a wide array of lofts and bounces to allow a player to \"fine-tune\" their short game with the wedges that best meet their needs. In some cases, with the high degree of customization, companies have done away with the traditional names for each club, and instead simply label each club with its loft and bounce angles. A 52-8 wedge, for example, would have 52 degrees of loft and 8 degrees of bounce, generally placing it in the \"gap wedge\" class. Most players carry three or four wedges on the course, and sometimes more, usually sacrificing one or two of their long irons and/or higher-lofted fairway woods to meet the 14-club limit.\n\nNewer designs of wedges, especially the sand wedge, have changed the shape of the sole slightly to reduce the bounce along the heel (hosel side) and provide a more curved leading edge. This newer shape allows for the golfer to \"open\" the clubface for short, high-backspin chip shots that \"stick\" on the green or even roll backwards, without the wide heel lifting the bottom edge of the club at address or the additional angle providing too much bounce.\n\nRecently, a ruling by the USGA and R&A to ban the sale of wedges with backspin-increasing 'square' grooves (but grandfathered certain existing designs) accelerated revenues from wedge sales as golfers rushed to acquire designs incorporating these grooves before the ban took effect. Sales peaked in 2010 with a 23% revenue increase, and wedge prices inflated to a record $97 (from a nominal price of between $25 and $75 per club).\n\nA pitching wedge is the lowest-lofted of the named wedges, used to hit a variety of short-range shots. The modern pitching wedge has a loft of around 48° (exact lofts vary by clubmaker and player preference) and little or no \"bounce\" (angle of the sole to the ground).\n\nThe pitching wedge is descended from the \"niblick\", an obsolete blade-style club with a high loft. As the older naming system gave way to numbered sets in the mid- to late 1930s, the standardization of loft angles led to a split in the niblick's normal range of lofts, to create the 9-iron (with a loft at the time of about 48–50°) and a new club lofted around 52–54°. Some manufacturers such as MacGregor kept with the numbering system and labelled this club the \"10-iron\", while other makers, seeking to capitalize on the usefulness of this club in the \"short game\", named the club the \"pitching wedge\" to associate it with the relatively new sand wedge and its similar utility for close-in shots. The term \"pitching wedge\" is now used by virtually all manufacturers and players to describe this club; Karsten Manufacturing (maker of the PING brand) simply labels their pitching wedges \"W\" for \"wedge\".\n\nThe modern pitching wedge is typically used from the fairway or rough for \"approach\" or \"lay-up\" shots requiring a distance of between 100 and 125 yards (exact distance will vary, as with any golf club's distance, on a number of variables such as exact club design, player skill and swing speed, and course conditions). It can also be used to play a ball from a bunker when the ball has not buried itself into the sand and the player needs more distance on the shot than their sand wedge can provide. With an abbreviated \"chip shot\" swing, a pitching wedge can produce high-accuracy shots in the 30–70 yard range, and with a putting motion, the club can be used for \"bump and run\" shots from the rough or fringe onto the green.\n\nA gap wedge is the next higher-lofted wedge after the pitching wedge, and is usually used in a similar manner. It is a newer wedge and so is one of the least standardized as to its purpose and thus its design, but lofts for gap wedges are centered on 52° and have a moderate amount of bounce.\n\nThe concept of the gap wedge originated when the loft angles of irons were reduced as a result of the higher launch angles of modern \"cavity-back\" irons for a given loft, and also from amateur players' desire for greater range. The pitching wedge was de-lofted along with the numbered irons from about 50–52° to about 45–48°; however, sand wedges remained the same, because their 54–58° loft is part of their design which makes them effective at cutting through sand. This results in a \"gap\" of about 8–10° between the pitching wedge and sand wedge, which can result in a difference in carry distance of up to 40 yards between these two clubs. To fill this \"gap\" in loft and distance, some golfers began carrying an additional wedge in the 50–54° range. This club was often the pitching wedge or 9-iron from the player's older \"muscle-back\" set, but as the practice became more common, manufacturers began designing wedges specifically for this role. While clubmakers invented different names for this club, such as \"approach wedge\" (Callaway), \"attack wedge\" (TaylorMade), \"dual wedge\" (Cleveland) and \"utility wedge\" (Karsten Manufacturing - PING), the term \"gap wedge\" is typically used in conversation to describe a wedge in this general loft range, and is used by some manufacturers such as Adams Golf. Some are simply identified by their loft angle and bounce; a \"52-8\" wedge is a gap wedge with 52° of loft and 8° of bounce.\n\nThe specifics of the gap wedge's design differ more between various examples than other wedges because the club is newer and so has a less well-defined traditional purpose. With the nominal loft of 52°, a gap wedge can be used for almost any shot in which the player would normally use their pitching wedge, but needs lesser distance; a full swing with a gap wedge will carry about 90–110 yards depending on the many inherent variables. A key area of variation between different gap wedges is in the bounce angle; typically the more bounce the club has, the better its performance in soft lies and tall grass, but the worse it will perform on firm or tight lies, and vice versa. Many players use a bounce of between 5° and 8°, making this club a blend of the characteristics of the neighboring pitching and sand wedges, allowing it to be used for certain bunker shots while not sacrificing its utility on firmer ground. However, gap wedges are available from 48–56° loft and with 0° to 12° of bounce, allowing a player to select the club with the exact characteristics they feel they'll need.\n\nA sand wedge is a type of golf club with a specialized design intended to help the player play the ball from soft lies such as sand bunkers. It has a loft of about 56°, and about 10° of \"bounce\".\n\nGene Sarazen won the 1932 British and US Open tournaments with a new club he had invented that was specialized for sand play. He is hailed as the inventor of the modern sand wedge, which he developed by taking a niblick (9-iron), soldering additional metal underneath the leading edge to create a wide, heavy sole on the club, and then experimenting with the angle that the sole made to level ground. The resulting club had a wedge-shaped profile, and offered better loft to escape from deep or sloped bunkers (unlike the older low-lofted \"jigger\" traditionally used for bunker shots), while not \"digging in\" to the soft sand like a lofted iron such as the niblick would normally do.\n\nThe modern sand wedge still uses the ideas of high mass, high loft, and bounce angle, but the modern sand wedge clubhead has much higher mass than earlier designs, up to 40oz (2.5 lb, 1.13 kg), to drive the clubhead through the firmer sand found in many courses. There can also be differences in shaft length; while some sand wedges follow the systematic progression of shorter shaft lengths for higher lofts, many sand wedges are longer than the adjacent lofted wedges. This encourages the player to hit sand wedge shots \"fat\" (the club hits the ground before the ball), which on a firm lie is generally bad, but in the case of a ball embedded or buried in soft bunker sand this will get the clubhead all the way under the ball to lift it out. The resulting plume of sand from such a shot was made famous by Sarazen as the \"explosion shot\" and is a common sight in televised golf events.\n\nAs its name suggests, a sand wedge is used most often to extract the ball from a bunker. However, the features which make it useful for this purpose are advantageous in other soft lies such as thick rough, soggy ground or mud. While the high angle of bounce can make it difficult to use on firm lies (the sole will raise the leading edge of the club which can result in the player hitting the ball edge-on; a \"thin\" or \"skulled\" shot), it can be used much as any other \"short iron\" would; with a \"full swing\", a skilled golfer can typically hit a sand wedge between 80 and 100 yards, and with a chip shot, a sand wedge can produce short \"lobs\" of between 20 and 60 yards.\n\nThe lob wedge is a club with a loft of around 60°, typically the highest in a player's bag. It is used for specialized shots requiring either extreme launch angle, short carry distance and/or no rolling distance after impact.\n\nDave Pelz, a former NASA physicist and golf short-game coach, envisioned the lob wedge in the 1980s as an answer to modern greens, which are designed to be more difficult to approach to add extra challenge to the game. These greens are typically elevated above the fairway, are less level and more undulating than traditional greens, and are surrounded on some or all sides by hazards. These greens require an approach shot that drops the ball very precisely onto the green near the pin, and then \"sticks\" with little or no roll to prevent the ball following an uneven grade or overshooting the pin into a hazard. He proposed a new club with low to mid bounce and a loft angle of 60° to accomplish such a shot. Pro player Tom Kite was among the first players to use such a club, encouraging other professionals and amateurs to follow his lead. In 1984, Karsten Manufacturing introduced the first mass-produced \"L\" wedge, as part of PING's widely successful Eye and Eye-2 iron sets, cementing the wedge's name as the \"lob\" wedge.\n\nThe lob wedge can be used for any shot requiring a short carry distance (typically 10–50 yards), and/or a very high launch angle, which also results in high backspin and thus little rolling distance after impact. Such shots include tight approaches to the green, shots from close to a tree or other tall obstruction, shots to gain a more favorable lie on the fairway, and certain bunker shots. The high launch angle and thus long carry time can be an impediment in high winds, but skilled golfers can use the long \"hang time\" of a lob wedge shot to take advantage of a favorable wind. The wedge typically has low to moderate bounce (0–4°) for fairway and other firm lies, but because of its high loft even 2–3° of bounce will counterbalance the downward force of the wedge's striking face, making a club with this configuration useful in sand as well. Players will often use a lob wedge to play from a sand trap adjacent to the green, instead of \"opening\" a sand wedge (a more difficult shot to make accurately). It can be used with a full swing from the fairway or rough to carry about 40–60 yards, but it's more commonly used with a chip shot from very close to the green, to carry 10–40 yards and \"drop\" the ball into an exact spot on the green.\n\nAn ultra lob wedge is a specialization of the lob wedge with an extremely high loft, as high as 70°. Synonyms are generally marketing terms and include the \"flop wedge\" and \"final wedge\". When included in a club set, it generally has the highest loft of the set. It is used for specialized, extremely high-angle shots such as from the \"lip\" of a bunker. This wedge is generally made by specialty companies, and some argue that their purpose is redundant, as a regular lob wedge can be \"opened\" for extra loft in situations calling for such a high launch angle. However, these shots are very tricky to make as they require substantial changes to a player's normal swing mechanics.\n\nFlannery & Leech, \"Golf Through The Ages, 600 Years of Golfing Art\".

African nations typically fall toward the bottom of any list measuring small size economic activity, such as income per capita or GDP per capita, despite a wealth of natural resources. In 2009, 22 of 24 nations identified as having \"Low Human Development\" on the United Nations' (UN) Human Development Index were in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2006, 34 of the 50 nations on the UN list of least developed countries are in Africa. In many nations, GDP per capita is less than US$5200 per year, with the vast majority of the population living on much less (according to World Bank data, by 2016 the island nation of Seychelles was the only African country with a GDP per capita above US$10,000 per year). In addition, Africa's share of income has been consistently dropping over the past century by any measure. In 1820, the average European worker earned about three times what the average African did. Now, the average European earns twenty times what the average African does. Although GDP per capita incomes in Africa have also been steadily growing, measures are still far better in other parts of the world.\n\nDespite large amounts of arable land south of the Sahara Desert, small, individual land holdings are rare. In many nations, the land is subject to tribal ownership and in others, most of the land is often in the hands of descendants of European settlers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, according to a 2005 IRIN report, about 82% of the arable land in South Africa is owned by those of European descent. Many nations lack a system of freehold landowning. In others, the laws prevent people from disadvantaged groups from owning land at all. Although often these laws are ignored, and land sales to disadvantaged groups occur, legal title to the land is not assured. As such, rural Africans rarely have clear title to their own land and have to survive as farm laborers. Unused land is plentiful but is often private property. Most African nations have very poor land registration systems, making squatting and land-theft common occurrences. This makes it difficult to get a mortgage or similar loan, as ownership of the property often cannot be established to the satisfaction of financiers.\n\nThis system often gives an advantage to one native African group over another and is not just Europeans over Africans. For example, it was hoped that land reform in Zimbabwe would transfer land from European landowners to family farmers. Instead, it simply substituted native Africans with ties to the government for Europeans, leaving much of the population disadvantaged. Because of this abuse, foreign aid that was destined for land purchases was withdrawn. (See Land reform in Zimbabwe)\n\nHistorically, such programs have been few and far between, with much foreign aid being concentrated on the raising of cash crops and large plantations rather than family farms.\n\nThere is no consensus on what the optimal strategy for land use in Africa may be. Studies by the National Academy of Sciences have suggested great promise in relying on native crops as a means of improving Africa's food security. A report by Future Harvest suggests that traditionally used forage plants show the same promise. Supporting a different viewpoint is an article appearing in \"AgBioForum\" which suggests that smallholder farmers benefited substantially by planting a genetically modified variety of maize. In a similar vein is an article discussing the use of nontraditional crops for export published as part of the proceedings of a Purdue University symposium.\n\nOver $500 billion (U.S.) has been sent to African nations in the form of direct aid. The consensus is that the money has had little long-term effect.\n\nIn addition, most African nations have owed substantial sums of money. However, a large percentage of the money was either invested in weapons (money that was spent back in developed nations, and provided little or no benefit to the native population) or was directly misappropriated by corrupt governments. As such, many newly democratic nations in Africa are saddled with debt run up by totalitarian regimes. Large debts usually result in little being spent on social services, such as education, pensions, or medical care. In addition, most of the debt currently owed (approximately $321 billion (U.S.) in 1996) represents only the interest portion on the debt, and far exceeds the amounts that were actually borrowed (although this is true of large debts in developed nations as well). Most African nations are pushing for debt relief, as they are effectively unable to maintain payments on debt without extending the debt payments indefinitely. However, most plans to forgive debt affect only the smallest nations, and large debtor nations, like Nigeria, are often excluded from such plans.\n\nWhat large sums of money that are in Africa are often used to develop mega-projects when the need is for smaller scale projects. For example, Ghana was the richest country in Africa when it obtained independence. However, a few years later, it had no foreign reserves of any consequence. The money was spent on large projects that turned out to be a waste of resources:\n\nAnother example of misspent money is the Aswan High Dam. The dam was supposed to have modernized Egypt and Sudan immediately. Instead, the block of the natural flow of the Nile River meant that the Nile's natural supply of nitrate fertilizer and organic material was blocked. Now, about one-third of the dam's electric output goes directly into fertilizer production for what was previously the most fertile area on the planet. Moreover, the dam is silting up and may cease to serve any useful purpose within the next few centuries. In addition, the Mediterranean Sea is slowly becoming more saline as the Nile River previously provided it with most of its new fresh water influx.\n\nCorruption is also a major problem in the region, although it is certainly not universal or limited to Africa. Many native groups in Africa believe family relationships are more important than national identity, and people in authority often use nepotism and bribery for the benefit of their extended family group at the expense of their nations. To be fair, many corrupt governments often do better than authoritarian ones that replace them. Ethiopia is a good case study. Under Haile Selassie, corruption was rife and poverty rampant. However, after his overthrow, corruption was lessened, but then famine and military aggressiveness came to the fore. In any event, corruption both diverts aid money and foreign investment (which is usually sent to offshore banks outside of Africa), and puts a heavy burden on native populations forced to pay bribes to get basic government services.\n\nIn the end, foreign aid may not even be helpful in the long run to many African nations. It often encourages them not to tax internal economic activities of multinational corporations within their borders to attract foreign investment. In addition, most African nations have at least some wealthy nationals, and foreign aid often allows them to avoid paying more than negligible taxes. As such, wealth redistribution and capital controls are often seen as a more appropriate way for African nations to stabilize funding for their government budgets and smooth out the boom and bust cycles that can often arise in a developing economy. However, this sort of strategy often leads to internal political dissent and capital flight.\n\nThe widespread availability of cheap labor has often perpetuated policies that encourage inefficient agricultural and industrial practices, leaving Africa further impoverished. For example, author P.J. O'Rourke noted on his trip to Tanzania for his book \"Eat the Rich\" that gravel was produced with manual labor (by pounding rocks with tools), wherein almost everywhere else in the world machines did the same work far more cheaply and efficiently. He used Tanzania as an example of a nation with superb natural resources that nevertheless was among the poorest nations in the world.\n\nEducation is also a major problem, even in the wealthier nations. Illiteracy rates are high although a good proportion of Africans speak at least two languages and a number speak three (generally their native language, a neighbouring or trade language, and a European language). Higher education is almost unheard of, although certain universities in Egypt and South Africa have excellent reputations. However, some African nations have a paucity of persons with university degrees, and advanced degrees are rare in most areas. As such, the continent, for the most part, lacks scientists, engineers, and even teachers. The seeming parody of aid workers attempting to teach trilingual people English is not entirely untrue.\n\nSouth Africa under apartheid is an excellent example of how an adverse situation can further degrade. The largely black population earlier wished to learn English (black South Africans saw it as a way to unite themselves as they speak several different native languages).\n\nThe greatest mortality in Africa arises from preventable water-borne diseases, which affect infants and young children greater than any other group. The principal cause of these diseases is the regional water crisis, or lack of safe drinking water primarily stemming from mixing sewage and drinking water supplies.\n\nMuch attention has been given to the prevalence of AIDS in Africa. 3,000 Africans die each day of AIDS and an additional 11,000 are infected. Less than one percent are actually treated. However, even with the widespread prevalence of AIDS (where infection rates can approach 30% among the sexually active population), and fatal infections such as the Ebola virus, other diseases are far more problematic. In fact, the situation with AIDS is improving in some nations as infection rates drop, and deaths from Ebola are rare. On the other hand, diseases once common but now almost unknown in most of the industrialized world, like malaria, tuberculosis, tapeworm and dysentery often claim far more victims, particularly among the young. Polio has made a comeback recently due to misinformation spread by anti-American Islamic groups in Nigeria. Diseases native to Africa, such as sleeping sickness, also resist attempts at elimination too.\n\nClean potable water is rare in most of Africa (even those parts outside the sub-Saharan region) despite the fact that the continent is crossed by several major rivers and contains some of the largest freshwater lakes in the world. However, many of the major population centres are coastal, and few major cities have adequate sewage treatment systems. Although boiling water is a possibility, fuel for boiling is scarce as well. The problem is worst in Africa's rapidly growing cities, such as Cairo, Lagos and Kinshasa.\n\nColonialism concentrated on connecting the coast with internal territories. As such, nearly none of Africa's roads and railways connect with each other in any meaningful way. Connecting Africa's extensive railway network has recently become a priority for African nations outside of southwest Africa, which has an integrated network. \n\nTransportation between neighbouring coastal settlements is nearly always by sea, no matter the topography of the land in between them. Even basic services like telecommunications are often treated the same way. For example, phone calls between Ghana and neighbouring Côte d'Ivoire once had to be routed through Britain and France. \n\nAlthough Africa had numerous pre-European overland trade routes, few are suitable for modern transport such as trucks or railways, especially when they cross old European colonial borders. Another problem is that in many countries the roads, railway tracks, railway rolling stock, ships and ports are often old and badly maintained and many transportation systems have barely been updated and further developed since the end of colonialism.\n\nDespite other hot spots for war, Africa consistently remains among the top places for ongoing conflicts, consisting of both long-standing civil wars (e.g. Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo), ethnic conflicts that even resulted in genocides (e.g. the Rwandan genocide) and conflicts between countries.\n\nThe long-standing civil wars are in part due to the border-drawing of the late 19th century's Scramble for Africa, which accidentally did not take into account the various ethnic groups due to lack of local knowledge and research. Post decolonization, the European-set borders were accepted by various leaders; however, there remains internal and cross-border struggles, and separatist concerns by popular demand to the governments as they transition to democracy, leading to fears of further destabilization.\n\nIn recent years, religious conflicts have also increased, with Islamistic paramilitary terrorist groups like Boko Haram (Nigeria) and Al-Shabaab (Somalia) having committed many brutal, deadly terrorist acts that further decrease safety and prospects of development in the concerned regions. Despite a lack of basic social services or even the basic necessities of life, military forces are often well-financed and well-equipped.\n\nActs of war and terrorism further harm the chances of development in the regions concerned as they do not only cause economic downturns but also cause severe damage to the often already underdeveloped infrastructure as well as government shutdowns, further worsen the often already tense safety situation and cause large numbers of refugees.\n\nAs a result, Africa is full of refugees, who are often deliberately displaced by military forces during a conflict, rather than just having fled from war-torn areas. Although many refugees emigrate to open countries such as Germany, Canada, and the United States, the ones who do emigrate are often the most educated and skilled. The remainder often become a burden on neighbouring African nations that, while peaceful, are generally unable to deal with the logistical problems refugees pose as these nations are often already barely capable of fulfilling the needs of their own population.\n\nCivil war usually has the result of totally shutting down all government services. However, any conflict generally disrupts what trade or economy there is. Sierra Leone, which depends on diamonds for much of its economic activity, not only faces disruption in production (which reduces the supply), but a thriving black market in conflict diamonds, which drives down the price for what diamonds are produced.\n\nThe link between climate change and poverty has been examined. Climate change is likely to increase the size, frequency, and unpredictability of natural hazards. However, there is nothing natural about the transformation of natural hazards into disasters. The severity of a disaster's impact is dependent on existing levels of vulnerability, the extent of exposure to disaster event and the nature of the hazard. A communities' risk to disaster is dynamic and will change over space and time. It is heavily influenced by the interplay between economic, socio-cultural and demographic factors, as well as skewed development, such as rapid and unplanned urbanisation.\n\nThe level of poverty is a key determinant of disaster risk. Poverty increases propensity and severity of disasters and reduces peoples' capacity to recover and reconstruct. However, vulnerability is not just shaped to poverty, but linked to wider social, political and institutional factors, that govern entitlements and capabilities.\n\nAfrica's economic malaise is self-perpetuating, as it engenders more of the disease, warfare, misgovernment, and corruption that created it in the first place. Other effects of poverty have similar consequences. The most direct consequence of low GDP is Africa's low standard of living and quality of life. Except for a wealthy elite and the more prosperous peoples of South Africa and the Maghreb, Africans have very few consumer goods. Quality of life does not correlate exactly with a nation's wealth. Angola, for instance, reaps large sums annually from its diamond mines, but after years of civil war, conditions there remain poor. Radios, televisions, and automobiles are rare luxuries. Most Africans are on the far side of the digital divide and are cut off from communications technology and the Internet, however, use of mobile phones has been growing dramatically in recent years with 65% of Africans having access to a mobile phone as of 2011. Quality of life and human development are also low. African nations dominate the lower reaches of the UN Human Development Index. Infant mortality is high, while life expectancy, literacy, and education are all low. The UN also lowers the ranking of African states because the continent sees greater inequality than any other region. The best educated often choose to leave the continent for the West or the Persian Gulf to seek a better life.\n\nCatastrophes cause deadly periods of great shortages. The most damaging are the famines that have regularly hit the continent, especially the Horn of Africa. These have been caused by disruptions due to warfare, years of drought, and plagues of locusts.\n\nAn average African faced annual inflation of over 60% from 1990 until 2002 in those few countries that account for inflation. At the high end, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo both saw triple-digit inflation throughout the period. Most African nations saw inflation of approximately 10% per year.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1952407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952407", "title": "Houston Aeros (WHA)", "text": "Houston Aeros (WHA)\n\nThe Houston Aeros were a professional ice hockey team in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1978.\n\nThe Aeros were originally slated to play in Dayton, Ohio, as a charter member of the WHA. However, Dayton residents were indifferent at best to a WHA team, and while there were questions regarding whether a U.S. market with less than a million people and a stagnating economy would support a major league hockey franchise in the long term, the more critical short-term issue was that Dayton did not have a suitable arena. The largest arena in the city, the University of Dayton Arena, did not have an ice plant and the university balked at the cost of installing one. The largest hockey venue, Hara Arena, seated only 5,000 people—not enough even for temporary use. Due to these problems, owner Paul Deneau moved the team to Houston, Texas. Although the Aeros name had originally been chosen in honor of the Wright brothers, it was also deemed appropriate for Houston given the importance of the space industry.\n\nIn Houston, the Aeros became one of the most successful franchises in the WHA. They won four consecutive Western Division titles, from 1973–74 to 1976–77 seasons, and finished second in the Western Division in 1972–73 and third in the league in 1977–78. They won the AVCO World Trophy in 1974 over the Chicago Cougars and in 1975 over the Quebec Nordiques, winning both series in four-game sweeps; and lost in the 1976 AVCO finals to the Winnipeg Jets, also in a sweep. \n\nIn 1977, John Ziegler became president of the WHA's established rival, the National Hockey League. Shortly after becoming NHL president, Ziegler initiated the first serious merger discussions with the WHA. Houston, along with Cincinnati, Winnipeg, New England, Quebec, and Edmonton applied for entry into the NHL. After a lengthy debate, NHL owners voted the proposal down.\n\nMerger discussions resumed in 1978, and it again appeared that the Aeros, as one of the league's strongest teams, were an obvious candidate to join the NHL. Unfortunately for Houston, by this time Ziegler realized NHL owners would never vote to admit six teams and floated a proposal that would admit four WHA franchises. The WHA responded by insisting that all three of its Canadian teams be included in the merger. This left room for only one American team. The Aeros and Whalers were the only serious contenders, as they were the most stable of the American teams. Aeros owner Kenneth Schnitzer attempted to persuade Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs to support a merger that included the Aeros and not the Hartford-based Whalers. However, Jacobs, as one of the older league's most hard-line owners, was opposed to any sort of merger with the WHA. In any event, Ziegler was cool to the idea of adding another Sun Belt NHL team. Of the three Sun Belt teams that had joined the league since 1967, one (the California Golden Seals) had already relocated and two (the Los Angeles Kings and Atlanta Flames) were struggling financially. The Flames, as it turned out, would move to Calgary two years later. \n\nDuring the final series of talks, it soon became evident that no merger of any sort would take place in time for the 1978-79 NHL season. It was also apparent that when there was a merger, the Aeros were not likely to be included. Schnitzer announced that the Aeros would not take part in the 1978-79 WHA season. He first applied for direct admission to the NHL, only to find the older league uninterested in such an expansion with so many of its existing franchises struggling. Finally, Schnitzer campaigned to be allowed to purchase an existing club and relocate it to Houston. The obvious candidate to move was the Cleveland Barons (the former Seals), who had barely survived the season and were on the verge of folding. Schnitzer believed the older league would accept almost any other proposal as an alternative to the perceived embarrassment of having to disband a franchise, and did come close to a deal to relocate the moribund Barons franchise to Houston. However, the NHL instead opted to approve a proposal from the owners of the Minnesota North Stars to buy the Barons franchise and \"merge\" it with their own. Having run out of options, Schnitzer folded the Aeros on July 9, 1978. In doing so, the Aeros became the only WHA champion that did not eventually join the NHL.\n\nBill Dineen was the Aeros' head coach during their entire stay in the WHA. Among the players for the Aeros were Gordie Howe and his two sons Mark and Marty, who became the first father/son combination to play together in professional hockey. When Mark Howe retired as a member of the Detroit Red Wings (his father's old team) in 1995, he was the last member of the Houston Aeros to be playing in the NHL.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1952410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952410", "title": "Harold Gimblett", "text": "Harold Gimblett\n\nHarold Gimblett (19 October 1914 – 30 March 1978) was a cricketer who played for Somerset and England. He was known for his fast scoring as an opening batsman and for the much-repeated story of his debut. In a book first published in 1982, the cricket writer and Somerset historian David Foot wrote: \"Harold Gimblett is the greatest batsman Somerset has ever produced.\"\n\nGimblett scored at a fast rate throughout his career, and hit 265 sixes – \"surely a record for a regular opening batsman\", wrote Eric Hill, his postwar opening partner and thereafter a long-time journalist watcher of Somerset. He appeared, however, in only three Tests, none of them against Australia, and he left first-class cricket abruptly, suffering from mental health problems that would remain with him to the end of his life.\n\nHarold Gimblett was born at Bicknoller in the Quantock Hills in west Somerset, where his family had been farmers since the 15th century. He was the youngest of three brothers and was educated at the local school at Williton and then at the fee-paying West Buckland School just over the border in Devon.\n\nHe played cricket successfully at school and for Watchet Cricket Club. In 1931, he left school; in August of that year, he made the first of his significant innings. In the match between Watchet and Wellington Cricket Club, he came to the wicket with Watchet on 37 for seven, chasing a total of 160. With another teenage batsman, Allan Pearse, Gimblett hit off the runs, making 91 himself. A year later, he was co-opted into the Somerset Stragglers team, a peripatetic amateur team which played matches across south west England, composed of former public school players of varying abilities, some of whom were the amateurs who formed a large contingent of Somerset county players up to the Second World War. In his first match for the Stragglers team, against Wellington School, he made 142 in 75 minutes.\n\nGimblett briefly moved to London to work, but city life was not to his taste and he returned home, resuming cricket for the Watchet club. One of the patrons of Watchet cricket, the town tailor W. G. Penny, who was also prominent in Somerset County Cricket Club, recommended him for a trial with the county, though there appears to have been some reservations over his temperament and his impetuous batting. There is also, in the same source, some suggestion that Gimblett himself was reluctant to test himself against top-class cricketers.\n\nEven so, at the start of the 1935 season, Gimblett was invited to go to Taunton for a two-week trial with the county. The trial seems not to have been a success, but it led directly to the sensation that was Gimblett's first-class cricket debut.\n\nGimblett's entry into first-class cricket in May 1935 was instant legend. Wisden, in its obituary of him in 1979, wrote: \"The start of his career was so sensational that any novelist attributing it to his hero would have discredited the book.\"\n\nHaving a two-week trial with Somerset, Gimblett had been told, before the period was over, that he had no future as a first-class cricketer. Accounts vary as to how this decision was reached. Gimblett himself, quoted in David Foot's biography, which relies heavily on material taped by Gimblett in the years immediately before his death, said he was told by the county secretary and former captain, John Daniell: \"You may as well finish the week. We'll pay you 35 shillings and your bus fare. Afraid you're just not good enough.\" Daniell's son, quoted in the same book, said that the Somerset professional players had advised against taking Gimblett on to the county staff: \"They used to tell my father they thought Harold was far too impulsive.\" A further factor may have been the almost permanent financial crisis that surrounded Somerset: the county club was probably not able to afford another professional player.\n\nOn the final Friday of Gimblett's trial, Somerset found themselves a player short for the match that started the following day against Essex at Frome when the amateur Laurie Hawkins reported in sick. Gimblett was told to get himself to Frome: Daniell arranged for the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes, who had a car, to pick him up from Bridgwater. Gimblett missed the bus from Taunton, and hitched a lift in a lorry. Somerset won the toss and chose to bat: three batsmen were out for 35, and at lunch the score was 105 for five. Soon after lunch, Dickie Burrough was out and Gimblett came to the wicket with Somerset six wickets down for 107 runs, joining Arthur Wellard.\n\nGimblett's first run came off his third ball, and shortly afterwards he was hitting the leg-break and googly bowler Peter Smith for 15 in an over. He raced to his 50 in just 28 minutes, off 33 balls, reaching it with a six. Wellard, unusually for him, was outpaced and was out, followed swiftly by Luckes, but Gimblett was joined by Bill Andrews, who also hit powerfully. Gimblett's century came in just 63 minutes, which proved to be the fastest century of the season, and it was made out of 130 runs added while he had been at the wicket. He finished with 123 out of 175 in 80 minutes, with three sixes and 17 fours. Somerset won the match with an innings to spare.\n\nThe innings turned Gimblett into an instant celebrity. Foot's biography records that Fleet Street writers and photographers descended on the Gimblett farm at Bicknoller; the former cricketer Jack Hobbs congratulated Gimblett in his newspaper column, but also warned that such a start would be difficult to sustain.\n\nSo it proved. Gimblett retained his place for the next match, against Middlesex at Lord's, only because of another injury to a regular player, and though he top-scored with 53 in the second innings (still batting at No 8), he himself was injured and missed the next month. Returning to the side in mid-season, he played with little success, though he took a few wickets with his medium-pace, including four wickets for just 10 runs against Gloucestershire at Bath, which would remain his best first-class bowling performance. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack summed up his first first-class season in its 1936 edition, noting that he \"failed to maintain his early form\". It went on: \"Almost entirely a forward player, he appeared to pay little heed to defence, and in the end lack of experience contributed to his undoing. Still, shrewd observers maintain that he possesses distinct possibilities, and with further opportunities he may become more than a useful member of the side.\"\n\nThat Wisden assessment was made to look unduly modest within weeks of the start of the 1936 season. Regular opening batsman Jack Lee had been allowed to leave Somerset to become coach at Mill Hill School, and Gimblett was promoted to open the innings against the Indians in Somerset's first match of the season. He made 103 and then an unbeaten 46 as Somerset won the match by nine wickets after making the Indians follow on. In the very next match against Lancashire at Old Trafford, he did even better with 93 in the first innings and an unbeaten 160 in the second, when he held on with the Somerset tail-enders to deny Lancashire victory. That gave him fleetingly a season's batting average of more than 200, and he followed that up with a third century a week later against the admittedly weak Northamptonshire side. This form earned Gimblett selection for the Test trial match for the series against the Indian team, a match between North and South at Lord's that featured a mix of established Test players and up-and-coming young players. Gimblett failed in the match, scoring just four runs in his only innings. He was nonetheless selected for the England team for the first Test of the 1936 series in an experimental opening partnership with Arthur Mitchell of Yorkshire.\n\nGimblett's first Test appearance was the most successful of his short Test career. In a low-scoring match in which the Indian team led England by 13 on the first innings, it was Gimblett's top-scoring 67 not out in the second innings that brought victory to his side. England had been set 107 to win, but with a damp pitch and uncertain weather, \"the task could not be regarded as an easy one,\" Wisden wrote. It went on: \"As Gimblett got the pace of the wicket, he developed sound hitting powers and hooked superbly.\" In partnership with Maurice Turnbull, who made 37, Gimblett hit off the runs in 100 minutes, playing \"with much skill and verve\".\n\nGimblett's status as one of the coming men of English cricket was confirmed by his selection on the Players' side for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, one of the centrepieces of the English cricket season. He was not a success, making just three and one. But he retained his place in the England team for the second Test at Old Trafford, opening this time with the Kent batsman Arthur Fagg, who was making his Test debut. This time, Gimblett failed, making just nine in England's single innings. The carrot at the end of the 1936 season was selection for the MCC team to tour Australia and New Zealand in the 1936–37 season; the side was picked in early August, and Gimblett was not named in it, the young opening batsmen selected being Fagg and Charles Barnett, who replaced Gimblett for the third and final Test match against India. In fact, Gimblett's form for the second half of the 1936 season was patchy, and from the high of averaging 200 with the bat in May he ended up at the end of the season with an aggregate of 1608 runs at an average of 32.81, half a dozen runs per innings less than both Fagg and Barnett. Wisden noted that he had achieved \"nothing of note\" in important matches apart from his \"dashing\" 67 in his first Test. It went on: \"As his slip-fielding fell rather below international standard, it became abundantly clear that he could not yet be labelled an England player.\" And it repeated criticism of a year before about lack of discretion: \"Using the horizontal bat with a great amount of freedom, he frequently fell, through lack of discrimination in selecting the right ball to hit, to catches on the leg-side. Still, most of his faults were due to inexperience, and as he is only 22 years of age his career will be watched with interest beyond the confines of his own county.\"\n\nDavid Foot's biography of Gimblett indicates that this 1936 season, although one of his most successful, also showed early signs of the illness that was to afflict him later. He reacted badly to being criticised for dropping an easy catch in the Old Trafford Test, and when he himself was dropped from the team for the final Test, he responded with relief: \"'Thank goodness that's over,' he said to anyone within earshot.\" Foot wrote: \"The Lord's and Old Trafford Tests became painful rather than treasured memories; he pleaded silently that he would not ever be selected again.\"\n\nIn contrast to the drama of 1936, the 1937 and 1938 seasons were quiet ones for Gimblett. Other batsmen of his own age, such as Leonard Hutton, moved ahead of him in the Test pecking order, and he was at times not fully fit. He completed 1000 runs easily in both seasons and there were occasional innings of brilliance: at Wells in 1937, he made 141 in 150 minutes with nine sixes and 16 fours against Hampshire. In 1938, Wisden noted that he was, at times, more defensive than he had been previously, and in run-getting he was overshadowed by his opening partner, Frank Lee, who scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. For some matches in 1938, Gimblett batted at No 4, Bertie Buse opening with Lee.\n\nGimblett had another of his \"purple patches\" early in the 1939 season, which was his most successful so far. He scored 905 runs in the first seven Somerset matches, including five centuries in successive matches. Wisden noted, though, that he now revealed \"less of the electrifying methods that first brought him to the front\". The return to form brought him back into Test contention. He was picked for the first Test against West Indies at Lord's, opening with Hutton and making 22 and 20. In the second innings, with England needing fast runs for victory, he hit the first two balls bowled by fast bowler Leslie Hylton for four and six. He did not retain his place in the Test team, but played in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, making 52 in the Players' first innings. In the season as a whole, he made 1922 runs at an average of 40.89.\n\nGimblett volunteered for the Royal Air Force for the Second World War, but was allocated instead to the Fire Service, and saw duty in badly bombed cities such as Plymouth and Bristol.\n\nIn the eight seasons after the Second World War Gimblett was the mainstay of the Somerset batting. Without taming his aggressive instincts, he had become more judicious in his shot selection, and though he remained until the end of his career likely to smash the first ball of a match for six, he also took on the role of senior batsman in a Somerset side that was usually weak in batting. In the 1946 season, Somerset's best for more than 50 years, he made 1947 runs at an average of 49.92 runs per innings, the highest seasonal average of his career. There were seven centuries, the most of any season, and they included 231 against Middlesex at Taunton, his first double century and part of what Wisden termed a \"merciless onslaught\" by the Somerset batsmen.\n\nThe return in 1947 was lower, but in 1948, with the Somerset batting seeming ever more dependent on him for runs, he responded with all of the four centuries scored by the team in the summer, and one of them was his own highest score and the highest innings made to that stage by a Somerset batsman: 310 against Sussex at Eastbourne. The previous Somerset record had been 292, set by the late Victorian era amateur Lionel Palairet. Gimblett told his biographer David Foot, on the tapes that form the backbone of the biography, that he had said on the pitch at Eastbourne to Sussex player James Langridge: \"Well, that's got rid of one amateur's name in our county's record books.\" Gimblett went on to say that a collection had been proposed to mark the feat, but that Somerset's secretary had been dismissive of the idea. \"I think that was when I first decided that my career with Somerset was going to end. I was deeply hurt,\" he said.\n\nBut it didn't end quite yet. In 1949, Gimblett passed 2000 runs for the season for the first time in his career, his 2093 in the season being a new record for Somerset at the time. He also hit two centuries in a match for the first time in his career, with 115 and an unbeaten 127 in the game against Hampshire at Taunton. \"The feeling that if he got out almost all was over never affected his play,\" Wisden commented of his efforts across the season.\n\nThe pattern was repeated in 1950, but with an odd mid-season twist. The England Test side was being outplayed by the West Indies, and specifically by two previously unknown spin bowlers, Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. After a bad defeat in the second Test at Lord's, the England selectors sent for Gimblett for the third match at Trent Bridge with the apparent aim of having him hit the two spinners out of their rhythm. It would have been Gimblett's first Test for 11 years and the move, according to Foot, was highly popular, and not just in Somerset. But just before the match, Gimblett developed a large boil, a \"carbuncle\", on the back of his neck. He was dosed with penicillin and travelled to Nottingham. \"A nation's sporting press meticulously documented the carbuncle's throb-rate,\" Foot writes. It was to no avail: Gimblett withdrew from the match, and was not picked again.\n\nAt the end of the 1950 English season, however, he ventured abroad for the first time, taking part in a Commonwealth tour of India and Sri Lanka and opening the batting in all five of the representative games. He had some success on the tour, scoring one century, the only one of the 50 centuries in his career not to be made for Somerset. Perhaps more typically, he was homesick and unhappy: \"At first I wondered whether I'd picked up a bug. But it was purely mental,\" he said in a tape transcribed in his biography. Lighter by about 12 kg, he struggled for runs more than usually in the 1951 season, and took a long break from cricket in July, returning to some form afterwards.\n\nSomerset awarded Gimblett a benefit match in 1952, though perhaps typically he grumbled that it was not the potentially lucrative bank holiday local derby match with Gloucestershire but the game with Northamptonshire at Glastonbury that he was allocated. Gimblett made a century in that match and had, in terms of run aggregate, his best-ever season in 1952. He scored 2134 runs in all matches, at an average of 39.51. Against Derbyshire at Taunton, he became the first Somerset player to hit two centuries in a match twice, scoring 146 and 116 in a drawn game.\n\nIf 1952 was a good season for Gimblett, then it was a poor one for his team. After several years in which the side had defied predictions and finished mid-table in the County Championship, Somerset fell to bottom place in 1952, and stayed there for four years. But Gimblett's own performance drew one of the game's accolades: in the 1953 edition of Wisden, he was named one of the Five Cricketers of the Year, alongside Tom Graveney, David Sheppard, Stuart Surridge and Fred Trueman.\n\nThe 1953 season, with 19 Championship defeats, was even worse than 1952: Gimblett's own performance was maintained, though three matches missed through injury meant his aggregate fell a little, but he \"seldom received adequate support from his colleagues\", wrote Wisden. The unbeaten 167 he made against Northamptonshire at Taunton was the 50th century of his first-class career. At the end of the 1953 season he played festival cricket at Hastings and Kingston and Wisden's notes on Somerset in 1954 announced that he had \"accepted a five-year contract to remain with the club\".\n\nThroughout his life, Gimblett's personality was inclined to be morose and depressive, and there is evidence from across his cricket career of a gulf between his entertaining cricket style and his own personal negativism. Alan Gibson, the cricket writer who himself suffered from bouts of mental illness, wrote of him: \"Most of those who watched him, or even met him, took him for a cheerful extrovert. This was wrong. He thought a lot, worried a lot, fretted a lot, all the more because he struggled to present a calm, bold front to the outer world.\"\n\nDavid Foot, the author of Gimblett's biography, wrote in his history of Somerset cricket that Gimblett \"retained obsessive complexes about class, money and health\". In the biography, Foot writes of discovering the depth and the variety of Gimblett's different hatreds: \"The hate – his uncompromising word – was spread over a wide area.\" He appears to have found congeniality difficult and resentment easy, and there were periods of depressive illness. These culminated at the end of the 1953 cricket season in what appears to have been a full-scale breakdown.\n\nGimblett's own words, quoted in the Foot biography, tell the story. \"I couldn't take much more. I was taking sleeping pills to make me sleep and others to wake me up. By the end of 1953 the world was closing in on me. I couldn't offer any reason why and I don't think the medical profession knew either.\" In the winter of 1953–54, Gimblett spent 16 weeks in Tone Vale Hospital, a psychiatric institution, where he was given electro-convulsive therapy, and was released in time to join the Somerset team for the start of the 1954 season. He played in the first two county matches of the new season, but was not fit enough mentally to continue and – though the details vary – Somerset agreed to give him time off. He did not appear in first-class cricket again. Later in the 1954 season, according to Gimblett's own report, he went to Somerset's Taunton ground to watch some of the cricket, and was \"ordered out of the ground\".\n\nOut of first-class cricket, Gimblett took a job as a cricket professional with Ebbw Vale Cricket Club in South Wales. He then applied for and got a job with his old Somerset captain, Jack Meyer, who was headmaster of Millfield School. The link with Meyer gave rise to continuing rumours of a possible comeback for Somerset across the 1950s, but it did not happen. In 1959, however, he appeared in a few Minor Counties matches for Dorset. At Millfield, Gimblett helped with the cricket coaching, ran the school shop and did other tasks around the school such as driving minibuses. In the end, his mental and physical health problems – he suffered from arthritis – meant he fell out with Millfield in the same way that he had with county cricket, and he retired to live at Minehead; he was involved in a minor way with coaching and fund-raising for Somerset, but his behaviour was sometimes unpredictable and he found it hard to reconcile his former fame with his reduced circumstances.\n\nAt the time of his death, Gimblett had moved from Minehead to a mobile home at Verwood, Dorset. He died after taking an overdose of prescription drugs. He was survived by his wife, Marguerita (Rita), whom he married in 1938, and by a son.\n\n"}
{"id": "1952413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952413", "title": "Matthew 3:7", "text": "Matthew 3:7\n\nMatthew 3:7 is the seventh verse of the third chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. The verse occurs in the section introducing John the Baptist. In this verse John attacks the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nThe original Greek of the key phrase \"generation of vipers\" is γεννημα εχιδνων (which also occurs in ). \n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:7.\n\nThis verse is the beginning of a tirade by John the Baptist. This lecture is also found in Luke, with this verse being very similar to . This section is not found in Mark and most scholars believe that Matthew and Luke are both copying from the hypothetical Q. The most important difference between the versions of Matthew and Luke is that in Luke's Gospel, John the Baptist speaks to the multitude that have come to see him, while Matthew has John addressing the Pharisees and Sadducees in particular.\n\nThe Pharisees and Sadducees were two powerful and competing factions within Judaism at the time. Throughout the New Testament, and especially in Matthew, the Pharisees are presented as opponents of Jesus and responsible for his crucifixion. Some versions translate the passage as saying they were coming \"for baptism\". The wording is ambiguous but based on the rest of the text most scholars feel that it is more appropriate to say they were coming \"to the baptism\" likely to observe and investigate this new movement, rather than to be baptized themselves. Alexander Jones notes that as the entrenched powers both groups would have reason to be deeply interested in new mass movements such as John's. However, the two acting in concert is, according to David Hill, quite ahistorical as the Pharisees and Sadducees were long and bitter rivals. The two groups reappear as a pair in Matthew 16. An alternative view is that the Pharisees and Sadducees are coming to be baptized, and that this reflects the mass popularity of John's program. it also incites his attack as he does not believe that many of those coming to him have truly repented. This would also close the distance between Matthew's speech directed at the Pharisees and Sadducees and Luke's to John's audience in general.\n\nA number of theories have been advanced to explain why Matthew might be directing John's attack to these groups while Luke focuses on the general multitude. Schweizer feels that since Matthew was writing for a more Jewish audience than Luke the author of Matthew did not want to offend all Jews and thus focused only on the unpopular elites. At the time and place the author of Matthew was writing the Pharisees were staunch opponents of the new Christian movement, and the author of Matthew thus had motive to direct criticisms towards them. Most other scholars disagree with this view and they believe that the phrase \"Pharisees and Sadducees\" more likely refers to all Jews, in keeping with Luke. Hill notes that the author of Matthew might use the term Sadducee to refer to all non-Pharisee Jews. France believes Matthew is just mentioning the two most prestigious of the many groups that came to observe John.\n\nAlbright and Mann note that a viper's brood was a common expression at the time indicating those filled with malice. Jesus later uses the same turn of phrase in and . France speculates that the term could be rooted in , which also connects to the tree metaphor in . Malina and Rohrbaugh note that the use of the word \"offspring\" implies a child not from a legitimate union. They suggest \"snake bastards\" is thus a more accurate translation. This also links to Matthew 3:9 where the Pharisees and Sadducees defend themselves by citing their lineage. This insult in this verse has been borrowed by a number of other writers, including Shakespeare in \"Troilus and Cressida\", Anthony Trollope in \"Barchester Towers\", Somerset Maugham in \"Catalina\", and in the title of François Mauriac's \"Le noeud de viperes.\"\n\nAlbright and Mann note that it is important not to read the word \"wrath\" as a synonym for anger. Rather in Jewish and Christian thought it refers to the necessary meting out of final justice by an all loving God. Clarke notes that this phrase has been reused in other important contexts. In \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" it is a warning of \"the wrath to come\" by a character known as the Evangelist that sets the protagonist on his quest. John and Charles Wesley used the same phrase to advertise the Bible studies that would eventually grow into Methodism.\n\n\"Generation of Vipers\" was the title of a 1942 book by Philip Wylie which criticized American society.\n"}

The field and seating areas were ready for the team's first game in April of that year, but the concession stands, restrooms, luxury boxes, and box office were not complete until that winter.

{"id": "1952417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952417", "title": "Intarsia (knitting)", "text": "Intarsia (knitting)\n\nUnlike other multicolour techniques (including Fair Isle, slip-stitch colour, and double knitting), there is only one \"active\" colour on any given stitch, and yarn is not carried across the back of the work; when a colour changes on a given row, the old yarn is left hanging. This means that any intarsia piece is topologically several disjoint columns of colour; a simple blue circle on a white background involves one column of blue and two of white—one for the left and one for the right. Intarsia is most often worked flat, rather than in the round. However, it is possible to knit intarsia in circular knitting using particular techniques.\n\nCommon examples of intarsia include sweaters with large, solid-colour features like fruits, flowers, or geometric shapes. Argyle socks and sweaters are normally done in intarsia, although the thin diagonal lines are often overlaid in a later step, using Swiss darning or sometimes just a simple backstitch.\n\n Knitting in intarsia theoretically requires no additional skills beyond being generally comfortable with the basic knit and purl stitches. Materials required include multiple colours of yarn, standard needles, and \"bobbins\". Bobbins serve to contain the inactive yarn and help keep it from getting tangled. Unlike the narrow, wooden ones used to make bobbin lace, modern intarsia bobbins resemble translucent plastic yo-yos that can snap tight to prevent the yarn from unwinding.\n\nAfter winding a few yards of each colour onto its own bobbin (and possibly several bobbins' worth of some colours), the knitter simply begins knitting their pattern. When they arrive at a point where the colour changes, the knitter brings the new colour up underneath the old one (to prevent holes) and starts knitting with it. If flat knitting, at the end of the row, the piece is turned round just as with regular knitting, and the knitter returns the way they came.\n\nThe simplest intarsia pattern is for straight vertical stripes. After the first row, the pattern is continued by always working each stitch in the same colour as the previous row, changing colours at exactly the same point in each row. To make more elaborate patterns, one can let this colour boundary drift from row to row, changing colours a few stitches earlier or later each time.\n\nIntarsia patterns are almost always given as charts (which, because of the mechanics of knitting, are read beginning at the lower right and continuing upward). The charts generally look like highly pixellated cartoon drawings, in this sense resembling dot-matrix computer graphics or needlepoint patterns (though usually without the colour nuance of the latter).\n\nThere are several techniques to execute intarsia when circular knitting. Executing intarsia \"in-the-round\" eliminates the need for seams and, in one case, turning the piece and working from the wrong side. Priscilla Gibson-Roberts discusses four techniques for knitting intarsia in the round in her book, \"Ethnic Socks & Stockings\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1952419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952419", "title": "Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!", "text": "Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\n\nViewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!, known in Japan as is a video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom for the Nintendo DS. It was released in 2005 in Japan and North America. Capcom partnered with Nintendo to distribute the game in Europe and Australia in early 2006. \"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" is the fourth game released in the \"Viewtiful Joe\" series. The game's story opens on the set of director Captain Blue's new action movie in an amusement park called Movieland. When a mysterious group of villains known as Madow steal the only copy of the film, the superhero Viewtiful Joe and his younger sister Jasmine quickly give chase.\n\nGameplay in \"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" is a mix of the platforming and beat 'em up video game genres. The DS touchscreen is a key feature of the game's controls, enabling players to utilize Viewtiful Joe's unique VFX powers in order to battle enemies and solve puzzles. These include being able to split the level in half horizontally or to swap the top screen to the touchscreen and vice versa. The game was relatively well received by critics, but it sold poorly.\n\n\"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" looks and plays similarly to its console counterparts \"Viewtiful Joe\" and \"Viewtiful Joe 2\". The game is presented with 3D graphics set on a 2D plane and has both platforming and side-scrolling beat 'em up elements. Both screens on the DS feature the same gameplay with the top screen showing a magnified view of the player character Joe. The player controls Joe throughout a series of stages, or \"episodes\", which are divided into subsections with set goals such as defeating a group of enemies or reaching a checkpoint. Players combat enemies with punches and kicks and dodge enemy attacks by ducking and leaping upward. Successfully dodging an attack dazes the enemy, allowing the player to counterattack. Defeating enemies and destroying certain boxes grant players coins called \"V-Medals\", which contribute to the overall score called \"V-Points\". Performing combo moves on enemies displays \"V-Marks\", which act as a bonus by converting to V-Points as well. Finally, V-Points are awarded at the end of each stage objective, with more points given depending on the player's performance, such as how skillfully and quickly it was completed and how much damage the player took. V-Points can be used at certain stage checkpoints to purchase new attacks and items.\n\nMuch of the gameplay is centered around Joe's \"Viewtiful Effects (VFX) Power\", which is used in combat and puzzle solving. VFX Power is represented by a gauge located beneath the player's health. The gauge drains when in use but automatically replenishes itself. If it empties completely, Joe will temporarily lose his superpowers and will take more damage from enemies. The total length of the gauge can be extended by collecting \"V-Tapes\" scattered about each stage. There are five VFX Powers, and many of them are required to be combined for some puzzles. The first ability, \"Slow\", will decrease the speed of everything onscreen, increasing the player's reaction time and attack strength. \"Scratch\" is performed by rapidly scratching the touchscreen and lets the player shake the screen around to make random pieces of debris fall on enemies and to dislodge larger objects. \"Split\" allows the player split the stage in half by drawing a horizontal line across the touchscreen.\" It is used to shift props in the background (such as flowing water), allows the player to traverse walls, and moves platforms and objects into or out of the player's perspective. The final two powers are used in conjunction with one another. \"Slide\" swaps the bottom screen with the top, both causing enemies to tremble in fear of Joe and giving the player access to more attacks. After using Slide, \"Touch\" allows the player to flip switches or turn gears in the background. The combination of these two powers is also used to remove small, normally indestructible enemies, such as bats, from gameplay by tapping them on the touchscreen.\n\nUnlike other games in the series, \"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" takes place primarily in the game's depiction of the real world instead of its fictional world of movies. The story is set in Movieland, an action film-styled theme park. The game opens on the set of a film starring movie hero and director Captain Blue and an aspiring actress named Jasmine. Just as Blue comes to the girl's rescue at a critical moment in the film, Jasmine's brother Joe, dressed as his alter ego Viewtiful Joe, steals the scene. Joe's girlfriend Silvia shows up, greeting Blue and Jasmine and inquiring why they are there. Jasmine explains her ambition to become like Junko, a legendary actress from the past. Suddenly, a group of villains crash the set and make off with a canister containing the reel of Blue's film. Wasting no time, Joe sets out after them. Joe quickly realizes he cannot use his \"Movie Energy\" to transform into Viewtiful Joe in the real world. To solve this, Blue has Silvia record Joe on a special movie camera called a \"V-Cam\".\n\nJoe travels through several park attractions, always one step behind the henchmen that possess Blue's film. His sister Jasmine also pursues Blue's film, finding it important because it contains her acting debut. Each time the duo catches up to the film, he is forced to fight an action cinema character whose \"hero-ness\" has been stolen by an organization called Madow. They include the robotic policeman Gadget-Cop, the android Killer Hands, the size-changing Alter Woman, and the fly-like Meta Rangers Digi and Log. Each one that Joe defeats seemingly comes to his or her senses. Joe and Jasmine eventually face a cloud-like entity calling itself Queen Heinderella, the leader of Madow. After easily overpowering Joe, Heinderella reveals to the siblings that she desires the film because it contains the very essence of Captain Blue himself, the \"Super Hero-ness\". The two eventually reach an attraction titled \"Viewtiful Joe - The Ride\", which terminates in battle with Blade Master Alastor, Joe's rival from past entries in the \"Viewtiful Joe\" series. After a heated battle between Joe's Six Majin robot and Alastor's own Rex Majin, Heinderella appears again and takes Blue's film. With Alastor's advice, Joe and Jasmine travel to a large castle in the center of the park in the game's last episode.\n\nJoe and Jasmine reach Heinderella in the throneroom of the castle, where she transforms the top of the structure into a giant, mechanized monstrosity, which Joe fights and destroys it. He is then confronted by a humanoid Heinderella, who proceeds to steal Joe's hero-ness from him, leaving him devoid of his superpowers. All the action film heroes Joe has met during his mission suddenly arrive and give up their own hero-ness to Heinderella. The queen admits that everything had been planned out from the beginning and explains her intent Joe's power for world domination. A powerless Viewtiful Joe is quickly disabled by her and falls helpless to the ground. With encouragement from Jasmine and Captain Blue, Joe regains his hero-ness and defeats Heinderella in a final battle. Heinderella reveals herself to be the late actress Junko, Joe and Jasmine's mother. Prior to the game's events, Junko had once been rich and successful with her acting career. However, Junko's dreams were dashed as her career plummeted shortly thereafter, and she coincidentally died from injuries suffered from a car crash while on her way to an audition. She explains that she was allowed one day to visit her children from heaven and that she used it to teach her kids to follow their dreams and to test their value of fighting for justice. Junko says farewell to them, and as the reunion ends, a new threat arises somewhere in the distance. Using the sense of justice instilled in her by her mother, Jasmine transforms herself into a super heroine, and she and Joe set off to face it together.\n\n\"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" was developed by Clover Studio, a subsidiary of Capcom. The game was first announced under the working title \"Viewtiful Joe DS\" at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2004 as an early third-party Nintendo DS release. Development of \"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" took one year to complete using a team of twenty people helmed by director Junichi Ota and producer Atsushi Inaba. Hideki Kamiya, who was responsible for some previous \"Viewtiful Joe\" titles, acted as an advisor and a scenario writer for the game. Takeshi Miura composed the soundtrack.\n\nAs \"Double Trouble!\" features 3D graphics like previous installments in the series, Inaba explained that the most difficult aspect of the game's development was bringing the world of \"Viewtiful Joe\" to the DS with regard to the handheld's limitations, specifically the number of polygons possible for display on the screen. The game requires use of the D-pad, facebuttons, and the DS touchscreen throughout the course of gameplay. Inaba stressed that the touchscreen functionality was designed for the player's finger instead of the DS stylus, as it creates a much more fluid experience during gameplay.\n\nGeneral reception of \"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" were positive. The game has a score of 76% on Game Rankings and a 73 out of 100 on Metacritic. IGN rated it 8.5 out of 10, netting it an \"Editor's Choice\" award. The website stated \"The game does have its quirks, mostly boiling down to the technical limitations: it's not as fast or energetic as past \"Viewtiful Joe\" games, and the touch screen sensitivity can get a little wonky in the heat of the battle. But even with these minor oddities, this game is one of the most fun and creative ways to move a 'traditional' console game onto the Nintendo DS.\" The game received a number of honors from the website during its coverage of E3 in 2005 including \"Best DS Game\", \"Best Action Game\" on the DS, \"Best Graphics\" on the DS, and \"Most Innovative Design\" on the DS. It additionally won \"Most Innovative Design\" for the DS in IGN's reflection on the year 2005. GameSpot had a similar opinion, rating it 7.6 out of 10. remarking that it \"is a good place for the beloved superhero to break into handheld games\" but that \"[t]he action and puzzle-solving do feel a bit repetitive at times, and the touch screen VFX powers take a bit of getting used to.\" Others thought it was excellent, such as 1UP.com, who rated it a B+. They stated that \"\"Double Trouble!\" delivers a refreshingly solid, worthwhile action romp. Joe runs, jumps, punches, and defies the laws of physics just like in the console \"VJ\" titles, and a handful of new touch-panel VFX powers provide clever twists.\"\n\n\"Famitsu\" reported that \"Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!\" sold approximately 5,661 units in Japan between November 2 and November 27, 2005.\n\n"}

It was ruled by a branch of the House of Stolberg.\n\nThe Counts of Wernigerode had become extinct in 1429 and their lands were inherited through Salic law by the Counts of Stolberg, sovereign counts of the Empire since the early 11th century. On 31 May 1645, the Harz line of Stolberg-Stolberg was divided between a senior Stolberg-Wernigerode line and a junior Stolberg-Stolberg line. Because Wernigerode was heavily damaged by the Thirty Years' War, the Counts of Stolberg-Wernigerode also resided in the castle of Ilsenburg.\nThe town of Gedern in Hesse, acquired in 1535, became the seat of the cadet branch of Stolberg-Gedern in 1677. This junior line, raised to an imperial principality by Emperor Charles VII of Wittelsbach in 1742, was reacquired by Stolberg-Wernigerode in 1804. The Wernigerode line also re-acquired Stolberg-Schwarza on 14 September 1748.\n\nIn 1714, Count Christian Ernest surrendered his military and the fiscal independence of Stolberg-Wernigerode to King Frederick William I of Prussia, although he still maintained subordinated rule over his territories as a count. The county was mediatised in 1807 and made part of the Kingdom of Westphalia.

Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes. Also known for their eponymous Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife, Fairbairn and Sykes had worked in the British Armed Forces and helped teach the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) quick, effective, and simple techniques for fighting with or without weapons in melee situations. Similar training was provided to British Commandos, the First Special Service Force, Office of Strategic Services, Army Rangers, and Marine Raiders. Fairbairn at one point called this system Defendu and published on it, as did their American colleague Rex Applegate. Fairbairn often referred to the technique as \"gutter fighting,\" a term which Applegate used, along with \"the Fairbairn system.\"\n\nOther combatives systems having their origins in the modern military include Chinese Sanshou, Soviet Bojewoje (Combat) Sambo, and Israeli Kapap. The prevalence and style of combatives training often changes based on perceived need, and even in times of peace, special forces and commando units tend to have a much higher emphasis on close combat than most personnel, as may embassy guards or paramilitary units such as police SWAT teams.\n\nDe-emphasized in the United States after World War II, insurgency conflicts such as the Vietnam War, low intensity conflict, and urban warfare tend to encourage more attention to combatives. While the United States Marine Corps replaced its LINE combat system with Marine Corps Martial Arts Program in 2002, The United States Army adopted the Modern Army Combatives (MAC) program the same year with the publishing of Field Manual 3-25.150. MAC draws from systems such as Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Sambo, Muay Thai, Boxing and Eskrima, which could be trained \"live\" and can be fully integrated into current Close Quarters Battle tactics and training methods.\n\nIn August 2007, MAC training became required in every Army unit by Army regulation 350-1. The Modern Army Combatives Program was adopted as the basis for the Air Force Combatives Program in January 2008.\n\nIn recent years the major tenets of MAC, namely \"live\" training and using competitions as a tool to motivate Soldiers and units to higher levels of training, have been adopted by many of the major Combatives Systems such as Krav Maga and the Russian military hand-to-hand combat system.\n\nIn 2001, Matt Larsen, then a Sergeant First Class, established the United States Army Combatives School at Fort Benning. Students are taught techniques from the 2002 and 2009 versions of FM 3-25.150 (Combatives), also written by Larsen. The aim of the regimen is to teach soldiers how to train rather than attempting to give them the perfect techniques for any given situation. The main idea is that all real ability is developed after the initial training and only if training becomes routine. The initial techniques are simply a learning metaphor useful for teaching more important concepts, such as dominating an opponent with superior body position during ground grappling or how to control someone during clinch fighting. They are taught as small, easily repeatable drills, in which practitioners could learn multiple related techniques rapidly. For example, Drill One teaches several techniques: escaping blows, maintaining the mount, escaping the mount, maintaining the guard, passing the guard, assuming side control, maintaining side control, preventing and assuming the mount. The drill can be completed in less than a minute and can be done repeatedly with varying levels of resistance to maximize training benefits.\n\nNew soldiers begin their Combatives training on day three of Initial Military Training, at the same time that they are first issued their rifle. The training begins with learning to maintain control of your weapon in a fight. Soldiers are then taught how to gain control of a potential enemy at the farthest possible range in order to maintain their tactical flexibility, what the tactical options are and how to implement them.\n\nThe three basic options upon encountering a resistant opponent taught are:\n\n\nDuring the graduation exercises the trainee must react to contact from the front or rear in full combat equipment and execute whichever of the three tactical options is appropriate and to take part in competitive bouts using the basic rules.\n\nThe Combatives School teaches four instructor certification courses. Students of the first course are not expected to have any knowledge of combatives upon arrival. They are taught fundamental techniques which are designed to illuminate the fundamental principles of combatives training. The basic techniques form a framework upon which the rest of the program can build and are taught as a series of drills, which can be performed as a part of daily physical training. While the course is heavy on grappling, it does not lose sight of the fact that it is a course designed for soldiers going into combat. It is made clear that while combatives can be used to kill or disable, the man that typically wins a hand-to-hand fight in combat is the one whose allies arrive with guns first.\n\nSubsequent courses build upon the framework by adding throws and takedowns from Wrestling and Judo, striking skills from Boxing and Muay Thai, ground fighting from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Sambo and melee weapons fighting from Eskrima and the western martial arts, all of that combined with how to conduct scenario training and referee the various levels of Combatives competitions.\n\nThere are several reasons that the combatives course is taught:\n\nLarsen recognized in the development of the Modern Army Combatives Program that previous programs had suffered from the same problems. Invariably, the approach had been to pick a small set of what were deemed simple, effective, easy to learn techniques and train them in whatever finite amount of time was granted on a training calendar. This \"terminal training\" approach, which offered no follow-on training plan other than continued practice of the same limited number of techniques, had failed in the past because it did not provide an avenue or the motivation for continued training.\n\nInstead, his approach was to use the limited amount of institutional training time to lay a foundation for training around the Army. Techniques were put together in a series of simple drills so that through repetition, such as during daily physical training or as a warm-up exercise, soldiers could be expected to not only memorize but master the basic techniques.\n\nDrills were designed to rapidly teach core concepts to students. The first and most widely taught drill is known as \"Drill One\" and is as follows:\n\nSuch drills serve many pedagogical functions. They instill basic movement patterns and so internalize the concept of a hierarchy of dominant positions. When used as a part of a warm-up they maximize the use of available training time, allowing instructors to review the details of the basic techniques without taking time away from more advanced training. New techniques can be taught in context, for example a new choke can be practiced every time the appropriate position is reached. They allow students of different levels to work together. An advanced student will not necessarily pass the guard or achieve the mount in the same way as a beginner but the drill still functions as a framework for practice. The drills also allow Combatives training to become a routine part of every soldier's day. During physical training for instance soldiers could be asked to perform the drills interchangeable with callisthenic exercises.\n\nThe most beneficial category of submission technique is the chokehold. Students are taught a variety of different chokes and are taught how a properly applied choke feels so that they know the difference between a choke that they must break or submit to immediately and one that they can safely ignore if they have an opening for a submission hold of their own. A properly applied blood choke will prevent the flow of blood to and from the brain, resulting in unconsciousness in approximately 4–10 seconds. The best known example of this is the rear naked choke.\nLess preferred, but also effective techniques are joint locks. Joint locks are not the preferred method for attacking an enemy, because they do not completely disable the enemy. Joints locks do inflict large amounts of pain and can secure compliance from the enemy. This makes them especially useful in controlling opponents during crowd control operations or when someone is being clearly threatening, but the rules of engagement prohibit killing them (if the opponent is easily given to surrender under pain). If compliance cannot be secured or is not desired, the joint lock can be extended fully, breaking the applicable joint. Students are taught the difference between pain that signals a joint lock is in progress and simple discomfort.\n\nLarsen founded US Army Combatives School in 2001 in building 69 at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nAfter years of developing the elite 75th Ranger Regiment's hand to hand program, he was assigned to the Ranger Training Brigade, the Combatives proponent at the time, to rewrite the Field Manual FM 21-150. Upon finishing this, it was published in 2002 as FM 3-25.150 (Combatives). He was asked by the 11th Infantry Regiment (a TRADOC unit) to develop a training course for their cadre. Advocacy for the Combatives doctrine was transferred to the 11th Infantry Regiment to follow him. An old, disused warehouse in Fort Benning, Georgia became the site of the school. Soon, units from around the Army were sending Soldiers to this course. Over the next several years, the program was developed around the idea of building virtually self-sustaining Combatives programs within units by training cadres of instructors indigenous to each unit. With the continued success of this approach, the school became the recognized source of instruction for the entire US Army.\n\nThere are four different courses taught at the Combatives Center:\n\nTrainers at skill level 3 or higher are certified to teach all courses lower than their certification level. Skill level 1 and 2 courses are now usually taught and participants certified at the unit level. Skill level 3 and 4 courses are usually held at Ft. Benning, GA. A Soldier who has a level 3 certification can certify other Soldiers to be skill level 1. Soldiers who are skill level 4 can certify other Soldiers to be skill level 1 or 2.\n\nOne of the fundamental aspects of Modern Army Combatives training is the use of competitions as a tool to motivate Soldiers to train. Realizing the inherent problem with competitive systems, that competitors will focus their training on winning and therefore only train the techniques that are allowed in competition, Larsen designed a system of graduated rules that, combined with scenario based training, demand that Soldiers train on all aspects of fighting.\n\nThere are four levels of competition;\n\n\nIn 2010 Larsen initiated a belt system for Modern Army Combatives at the Army Championships by promoting the first three Combatives Black Belts.\n\nDamien Stelly → Andrew Chappelle → Tim Kennedy (fighter)\n\nThe United States Air Force has at times in its history been at the forefront of Combatives Training. Soon after the establishment of the Air Force as a separate service in September 1947, General Curtis Lemay was appointed as the Commanding General of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). General Lemay, who had masterminded the US air attacks on the Japanese mainland during World War II, knew that US bomber groups in Europe had suffered more combat casualties than the US Marine Corps had in the Pacific. Many of the lost airmen ended up as German prisoners of war. He was determined that all of his flying personnel would have a working knowledge of hand-to-hand combat to aid in escape and evasion.\n\nIn 1951, General Lemay appointed Emilio \"Mel\" Bruno, his judo teacher, a former national American Athletic Union wrestling champion and fifth degree black belt in judo, to direct a command wide judo and combative measures program. Bruno devised a program combining techniques from aikido, judo, and karate. In 1952 the Air Training Command took over the program. The Commanding General was General Thomas Power. Because of the deficiency in qualified instructors, Power sent two classes of twenty four airmen to train at the Kodokan Judo Institute for several weeks. Based upon the success of this trial and after an official delegation from the Kodokan toured SAC bases in the United States, Bruno set up an eight-week training course at the Kodokan. Students trained eight hours a day, five days a week, and upon return to the United States were assigned throughout SAC. The course was a Japanese designed mix of judo, aikido, karate, and taihojutsu.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1966 the Air Force Combative Measures (Judo) Instructors Course was taught at Stead Air Force Base in Reno, Nevada. The 155-hour course consisted of: 36 hours of fundamentals of judo, 12 hours of aikido, 12 hours of karate, 12 hours of Air Police techniques, 12 hours of aircrew self-defense, 18 hours of judo tournament procedures, 5 hours on code of conduct, and 48 hours on training methods. There were also a 20-hour Combative Methods course and a 12-hour Combative Survival course for aircrew members.\n\nThe program was dropped in 1966 in an effort to save money and reduce aircrew training time. \nWith the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the demand for airmen with the ground troops on the battlefield grew significantly over their historic role. In response, commanders around the Air Force started independent training programs to both teach hand-to-hand combat and instill a warrior ethos in deploying airmen. Because of the decentralized nature of the training, approaches varied wildly.\n\nIn 2007 the Chief of Staff of the Air Force read an article in the \"Air Force Times\" about airmen training in one of the systems that was being widely used, the LINE system, which had previously been used and replaced in both the Marine Corps and the Special Forces, and ordered a review of all hand-to-hand combat in the Air Force. He tasked the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) to form a study committee to plan a way forward. \n\nThe AETC included Larsen and Dave Durnil, who had run the Combatives program for the US Army’s 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley Kansas and a program for both Army and Air Force ROTC at Kansas State University (KSU). Also on the AETC were Ed Weichers Jr. who had been the Air Force Academy's boxing coach for more than 30 years, and representatives from each command in the Air Force who were currently conducting combatives training of various sorts, including the Air Force Security Forces and the Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nThe committee was led by Lt. Col. Kevin Adelsen from AETC Headquarters and hosted by Col. Billy Walker, Head of the Physical Education Department, Directorate of Athletics at the Air Force Academy. before the first meeting, Lt. Col. Adelson visited Ron DonVito to witness and investigate LINE training, Matt Larsen at the Army Combatives School, and the Marine Corps Martial Arts Center of Excellence (MACE). After the first meeting Col. Walker led several of the Academy cadre to KSU to attend the Army Combatives courses. The result of all of this was the Air Force deciding to adopt a program based upon the Army Combatives Program but modified to fit the needs and culture of the Air Force. In 2009 Dave Durnil was hired to work at the Air Force Academy, which was designated the Combatives Center of Excellence with Col. Walker as its director.\n\nCombatives courses have been taught by the United States Military Academy for its entire history. The National Defense University's combatives program includes a course in Jigo Tensin-Ryu Jujutsu, also known as Combat Jujutsu. The Virginia Military Institute also has full-time civilian instructors for Level 1 Combatives that is offered to all students in addition to their mandatory boxing class. In 2005 the Modern Army Combatives Program began to spread to academia with its adoption at Kansas State University, where there are courses specifically tailored to military personnel (active duty and ROTC) and university athletes, in addition to those available to the general student body. The Kansas program is currently defunct.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The list starts with Confederation on July 1, 1867, and the first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. It includes all prime ministers since then, up to the current prime minister, Justin Trudeau, the twenty-third person to hold the office.\n\nCanadian prime ministers do not have a fixed term of office. Nor do they have term limits. Instead, they can stay in office as long as their government has the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons of Canada under the system of responsible government. Under this system, Prime Minister Mackenzie King was Canada's longest-serving prime minister, holding office in three non-consecutive terms for a total of twenty-one years and one hundred fifty-four days.\n\nThe prime minister's term begins upon appointment by the Governor General of Canada, usually after winning a general election, but sometimes after succeeding an outgoing prime minister of the same party. A prime minister stays in office until they resign, die or are dismissed by the Governor General. Two prime ministers have died in office (Macdonald and Sir John Thompson). All others have resigned, either after losing an election or upon retirement. Theoretically, the Governor General can dismiss a prime minister, but that has never happened.\n\nThe prime ministerial term is not tied directly to the term of the House of Commons, which the Constitution sets as a maximum of five years from the most recent general election. A prime minister takes office after winning an election, and resigns after losing an election, but the term in office does not match up directly to the term of the Parliament. An incoming prime minister will normally take office a few weeks after the election, and an outgoing prime minister will usually stay in office for a few weeks after losing the election. The transition period and the date for the transfer of office are negotiated by the incoming and the outgoing prime ministers.\n\nA prime minister who holds office in consecutive parliaments is not re-appointed as prime minister for each parliament, but rather serves one continuous term. When a prime minister holds office in more than one parliament, it is customarily referred to as the prime minister's first government, second government, and so on.\n\nA majority government normally lasts around four years, since general elections for Parliament are normally held every four years. Minority governments generally last for a shorter period. The shortest minority government, Prime Minister Meighen's second government, lasted just under three months. A prime minister who is selected by the governing party to replace an outgoing prime minister may also serve a short term, if the new prime minister is defeated at the general election. Prime Minister Tupper served the shortest term in Canadian history, only sixty-eight days, in this way. He was selected by the Conservative Party to replace Prime Minister Bowell just before the general election of 1896, which Tupper and the Conservatives lost. Prime Ministers John Turner and Kim Campbell both served short terms for similar reasons.\n\nOf the other prime ministers who served short terms, Arthur Meighen, Joe Clark, and Paul Martin had their time in office cut short by the collapse of their minority governments and the subsequent election of the opposition party.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, three prime ministers succeeded to the office and did not call an election: Prime Minister Abbott resigned for health reasons and Prime Minister Thompson died in office. Prime Minister Bowell resigned after a Cabinet revolt.\n\nOn six occasions in the twentieth century, a prime minister has retired and the governing party has selected a new party leader, who automatically became prime minister. Arthur Meighen (1920), Louis St. Laurent (1948), Pierre Trudeau (1968), John Turner (1984), Kim Campbell (1993) and Paul Martin (2003) all succeeded to the office in this way. The new prime minister may continue to govern in the parliament called by the previous prime minister, but normally calls an election within a few months. (Prime Minister Meighen was the exception, governing for over a year before calling an election.) In those cases, the time before and after the election is counted as one government for the purposes of this table.\n\nWhen a general election is called, the current prime minister stays in office during the election campaign. If the prime minister's party wins the election, the prime minister remains in office without being sworn in again; the prime minister's tenure of office is continuous. If defeated in the election, the outgoing prime minister stays in office during the transition period, until the new prime minister takes office. All of that time is included in the total \"Time in office\". The first day of a prime minister's term is counted in the total, but the last day is not.\n\nFor the first half century of Confederation, there were gaps between the term of an outgoing prime minister and the incoming prime minister. The shortest gap, two days, was between Macdonald and Alexander Mackenzie in 1873: Macdonald resigned office on November 5, 1873, and Mackenzie was appointed on November 7. The longest gap, ten days, was upon the death of Macdonald on June 6, 1891. Prime Minister Abbott did not take office until June 16, 1891. The last time there was a gap, of four days, occurred between Laurier and Robert Borden: Laurier resigned effective October 6, 1911, and Borden took office on October 10. There have been no gaps in office since that transition, with the new prime minister taking office the day after the former prime minister leaves office.\n\n (12)\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1952468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952468", "title": "Grivet", "text": "Grivet\n\nThe grivet (\"Chlorocebus aethiops\"), also known as African green monkey and savannah monkey is an Old World monkey with long white tufts of hair along the sides of the face. Some authorities consider this and all of the members of the genus \"Chlorocebus\" to be a single species, \"Cercopithecus aethiops\". As here defined, the grivet is restricted to Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea. In the southern part of its range, it comes into contact with the closely related vervet monkey (\"C. pygerythrus\") and Bale Mountains vervet (\"C. djamdjamensis\"). Hybridization between them is possible, and may present a threat to the vulnerable Bale Mountains vervet. Unlike that species, the grivet is common and rated as Least Concern by the IUCN.\n\nThe grivet's facial skin, hands, and feet are black. The face has a white line above the eyes. It has long white whiskers on the cheeks. The fur on the back has an olive color, while the front is white fur. The skin on the stomach has a blue tint. The fur has a bristly feel. The approximate head and body length for males is for males and for females. The length of the tail for males is approximately . The body mass ranges from with females at the smaller end of the scale.\n\nThe main habitat of the grivet is savanna woodlands. Its range is Sudan east of the White Nile, Eritrea, and Ethiopia east to the Rift Valley. It is also found in Djibouti and Eritrea. The grivet needs to live around a source of water, especially during the dry season. It is able to adapt to many environments.\n\nIn Tigrinya language: (wi’ag)\n\nThe grivet is most active in the morning and in early evening. It stays on the ground most of the day to eat and at night it sleeps in trees. The grivet spends a lot of time grooming, playing, climbing, and play fighting; all of these things help to ensure its survival. Its eating habits consist of eating mostly fruits, vegetables, and sometimes small mammals, insects, and birds, making it an omnivore. It will also scavenge for human food. It must drink water daily, especially in the dry seasons. It is one of few species that has multiple-male groups that are of moderate size. In the hierarchy of males, an individual shows its dominance by putting its tail in a stiff upright position and strolling past lower-ranked males. They travel in packs and usually move on all fours or quadrupedally, except when using both hands for carrying, when they manage to walk and run quite comfortably on two legs. Groups can range from five to over 70.\nFemales will have a limited number of mates, while males will have numerous. Swelling of the female's vulva alerts males as to when the female is in heat. Giving birth to one baby at a time is common and the pregnancy usually lasts two to three months. When the baby is born the mother will clean the infant and bite off the umbilical cord. Young have pink faces and black hair. It will take around two months for them to get their adult coats. The first few months, the infant will stay very close to its mother, but after six months, the infant is weaned.\n\nThe grivet is occasionally hunted as bushmeat. They are killed for either commercial or subsistence purposes. Although not endangered, it is threatened through destruction of habitat by way of disappearing forests. It is preyed on by large snakes, leopards, humans and sometimes baboons. The grivet may live for 13 years.\n\nThe grivet is one of five species of monkey known to have been kept in ancient Egypt, the others being the hamadryas baboon, the olive baboon, the patas monkey and the barbary macaque. Grivets were imported from the land of Punt, as attested in paintings and in the \"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor\". They were sometimes traded as far afield as Assyria. They are rarer in representations than baboons and, unlike baboons, do not seem to have borne individual names.\n\nGrivets are depicted on Egyptian tombs as house pets and on leashes. In some depictions the grivet may symbolize male sexuality. Early Dynastic statuettes of grivets have been found in sanctuaries, where they may have been votive offerings to the baboon god. A grivet shooting a bow was an aspect of the invisible god Atum and at Deltaic Babylon a grivet was the town god represented by a statue in the temple.\n"}

A typical performance lasts half an hour.\n\nThe initial fanfare – titled \"Sunrise\" in the composer's programme notes – became well-known after its use in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film \"\".\n\nThe work is orchestrated for piccolo, 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes, English horn, clarinet in E-flat, 2 clarinets in B-flat, bass clarinet in B-flat, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 6 horns in F and E, 4 trumpets in C and E, 3 trombones, 2 tubas, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, glockenspiel, bell on low E, organ, and strings: 2 harps, violins I, II (16 each), violas (12), cellos (12), and double basses (8) (with low B string).\n\nThe piece is divided into nine sections played with only three definite pauses. Strauss named the sections after selected chapters of Friedrich Nietzsche's novel \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\":\n\nThese selected chapters from Nietzsche's novel highlight major moments of the character Zarathustra's philosophical journey in the novel. The general storylines and ideas in these chapters were the inspiration used to build the tone poem's structure.\nThe piece starts with a sustained double low C on the double basses, contrabassoon and organ. This transforms into the brass fanfare of the Introduction and introduces the \"dawn\" motif (from \"Zarathustra's Prologue\", the text of which is included in the printed score) that is common throughout the work: the motif includes three notes, in intervals of a fifth and octave, as C–G–C (known also as the Nature-motif). On its first appearance, the motif is a part of the first five notes of the natural overtone series: octave, octave and fifth, two octaves, two octaves and major third (played as part of a C major chord with the third doubled). The major third is immediately changed to a minor third, which is the first note played in the work (E flat) that is not part of the overtone series.\n\n\"Of the Backworldsmen\" begins with cellos, double-basses and organ pedal before changing into a lyrical passage for the entire section. The next two sections, \"Of the Great Longing\" and \"Of Joys and Passions\", both introduce motifs that are more chromatic in nature.\n\nThe strings prevail in \"The Song of the Grave\", which acts like a transition section to the next section.\n\n\"Of Science\" features an unusual fugue beginning at measure 201 in the double-basses and cellos, which consists of all twelve notes of the chromatic scale. Measure 223 contains one of the very few sections in the orchestral literature where the basses must play a contra B (the lowest B on a piano), which is only possible on a 5-string bass or (less frequently) on a 4-string bass with a low-B extension.\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 4/4 c,4(\\pp g' c2) | b4( fis d2) | \\times 2/3 { ees4( g bes) } \\times 2/3 { a( e cis~ } | \\times 2/3 { des2) f!-- aes-- } | g2. } </score>\n\n\"The Convalescent\" acts as a reprise of the original motif, and ends with the entire orchestra climaxing on a massive chord.\n\n\"The Dance Song\" features a very prominent violin solo throughout the section.\n\nThe end of the \"Song of the Night Wanderer\" leaves the piece half resolved, with high flutes, piccolos and violins playing a B major chord, while the lower strings pluck a C.\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c\"\" { \\clef treble \\time 4/4 \\key b \\major <dis b fis dis>1\\ppp | \\clef bass c,,,4 r c r | c r r2 \\bar \"|.\" } </score>\nOne of the major compositional themes of the piece is the contrast between the keys of B major, representing humanity, and C major, representing the universe. Because B and C are adjacent notes, these keys are tonally dissimilar: B major uses five sharps, while C major has none.\n\nThere are two opinions about the world riddle theme. Some sources denote the fifth/octave intervals (C–G–C) as the World riddle motif. However, other sources refer to the two conflicting keys in the final section as representing the World riddle (C–G–C B–F–B), with the unresolved harmonic progression being an unfinished or unsolved riddle: the melody does not conclude with a well-defined tonic note as being either C or B, hence it is unfinished. The ending of the composition has been described:\n\nNeither C major nor B major is established as the tonic at the end of the composition.\n\nThe first recording was made in 1935 with Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1944, Strauss conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in an experimental high fidelity recording of the piece, made on a German Magnetophon tape recorder. This was later released on LP by Vanguard Records and on CD by various labels. Strauss's friend and colleague, Fritz Reiner, made the first stereophonic recording of the music with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in March 1954 for RCA Victor. In 2012, the Fritz Reiner recording was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry 2011 list of \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\" American sound recordings. The recording of the opening fanfare used for the film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" was performed by the Vienna Philharmonic and conducted by Herbert von Karajan.\n\nThe Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Lorin Maazel reached #33 in the UK chart in 1969 under the title of \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\".\n\nElvis Presley used the opening fanfare as the opening piece in his concerts between 1971 and his death in 1977, and as the introduction to several of his live albums, including \"\" (1972), \"Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite\" (1973), and \"Elvis in Concert\" (1977). Eumir Deodato's funk-influenced arrangement of the opening fanfare \"Sunrise\" theme reached #2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 U.S. popular music sales charts in 1973, and #7 on the UK Singles Chart. His version was titled \"Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)\", and won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\n\n"}
