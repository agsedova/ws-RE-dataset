It is located 6 kilometres south west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. Erskineville is a diverse suburb homing to a wide variety of ethnicity from its varying Southeast Europe and Aboriginal community. Erskineville is colloquially known as \"Erko\".\n\nErskineville is bordered by the suburbs of Newtown to the west, Redfern to the north, St Peters to the south, and Alexandria to the east. The locality of Camperdown sits over the north-west border.\n\nErskineville is a residential suburb. Erskineville Oval is located on the eastern border of the suburb.\n\nThe suburb was originally called after an earlier subdivision in 1846 in the south of Erskineville owned by Stephen Macdonald. The streets around the early Macdonaldtown subdivision are named after relations of the Macdonald family - Amy, Flora, Eve, Coulson and Rochford. Knight Street is named for Henry Knight, one of the earliest brickmakers in the district and the first mayor of Macdonaldtown. Devine Street is named for the first grant holder, Nicholas Devine, the first principal superintendent of convicts. He called his property Burren Farm, after a region of County Clare in his native Ireland.\n\nErskineville is named after \"Erskine Villa\", the home of Wesleyan minister, Reverend George Erskine, built in 1830. After changing owners a few times, the property was eventually left to the Church of England and became the rectory for the Holy Trinity Church at Macdonaldtown (it was demolished in 1961 after serving as the rectory for eighty years). \n\nThe area was first incorporated on 23 May 1872, with the name of the \"Municipal District of Macdonald Town\" (but was variously known as the \"Borough of Macdonald Town\" or the \"Municipality of Macdonaldtown\"). On 19 July 1872, the first council, consisting of six aldermen in one electorate, was elected (Charles Brandling Henderson, Henry Knight, James Bryan, Alexander Swanson, William Irwin and James Heighington), with Henry Knight elected as the first mayor at the first meeting on 23 July 1872.\n\nIn 1893 Macdonaldtown was renamed as Erskineville, when the Parliament of New South Wales passed the \"\"Borough of Erskineville Naming Act, 1893\"\", effecting the municipal name change. In the late nineteenth century, the inhabitants were originally market gardeners, though brick making and tanning also became dominant industries. The Victorian cottages and small rows of Victorian terraces that dominate the built form of the suburb were the homes of the workers in these industries, which explains their smallness: a four-metre wide terrace is large by Erskineville standards.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, manufacturing in the area diversified, and Erskineville became a resolutely working class inner city suburb. In 1938 the Erskineville Public Housing Scheme was inaugurated on the western end of Erskineville Park, as an early response by the NSW Government to the \"Housing Improvement Act 1937\" towards the problem of slum clearance in the inner city. From the 1970s, Erskineville underwent gentrification with new residents attracted to the village atmosphere, public transport links and the proximity to the CBD.\nFrom the 19th century until the second half of the 20th century, the south-eastern section of Erskineville was taken up by large industrial uses. Bakewell Brothers brick and pottery works operated until 1956, and Metters Limited had a large factory that made items such as the \"Kooka\" stove operating from 1907 to 1974. Steelworks like McPherson’s Pty Ltd and Hadfields Steel Works also operated until the 1970s. The site of these industrial works were identified since 1998 as a site for urban renewal, with the land east of the rail line, south of Ashmore Street and north of Coulson Street known as the \"Ashmore Estate\". The Ashmore Estate is currently identified for major residential redevelopment as part of the urban renewal process.\n\nThe Erskineville line opened as an electric double track tramway in 1909. It branched from tracks at Regent Street in Chippendale, and passed west along Meagher Street, then south into Abercombie Street. It followed Abercrombie Street south across the junction with Cleveland Street through Golden Grove, before swinging south into Golden Grove Street then right into Wilson Street. The line then passed under the railway lines at Burren Street, adjacent to the entrance to Macdonaldtown railway station. The line then became a single track loop passing up Burren Street to Erskineville Road, then west along Erskineville Road to Septimus Street, then Albert Street before rejoining the tracks at Burren Street. Services operated from Circular Quay using the Pitt and Castlereagh Street lines. The line south of [Cleveland Street closed in 1940, with the northern section used by other services until its closure in 1958.\n\nThe Henderson Road line was a short line that branched from the Alexandria line tracks at the corner of Henderson and Mitchell Roads in Alexandria and passed along Henderson Road to Park Street in Erskineville, and later to Bridge Street adjacent to Erskineville railway station. Services operated from Circular Quay with the line opening to Park Street in 1906 and to Bridge Street in 1909. The line was an electrified single track throughout. The line was an early closure in 1933 and was replaced by a private bus service that no longer operates.\n\nHeavy rail was extended south from Central railway station to Erskineville between 1884 and 1893 via the Illawarra railway line. Today, Erskineville is served by the T3 Bankstown Line of the Sydney Trains network. Newtown railway station, Macdonaldtown railway station and St Peters railway station also service the suburb and are within close distance from the centre of Erskineville.\n\nBuses provide a service from Marrickville Metro shopping centre at Marrickville to Surry Hills.\n\n\nAt the 2016 census, there were 8,014 residents in Erskineville. 59.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 7.2%, New Zealand 3.2% and China 2.5%. 74.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 2.5%, Spanish 1.5% and Cantonese 1.4%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 54.8% and Catholic 14.1%. On the day of the Census, 45.9% of employed people used public transport as at least one of their methods of travel to work and 28.1% used car (either as driver or as passenger). The main housing types were flats or units 55.3%, semi-detached or townhouses 40.2% and separate houses 3.5%. Just over half of residents (50.1%) were renting, compared with the national average of 30.9%.\n\n\nThere are two schools within Erskineville itself, both catering for the primary-level (K–6):\n\nIn addition, Erskineville is serviced by several public secondary schools. The suburb itself is within the catchment-area of the Newtown High School of the Performing Arts, while Alexandria Park Community School (K–12), Marrickville High School and Tempe High School are the closest comprehensives.\n\nErskineville is covered by HCAs in approximately 75% of its area. These include:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2303174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303174", "title": "Ice Age: The Meltdown", "text": "Ice Age: The Meltdown\n\nIce Age: The Meltdown is a 2006 American computer-animated adventure comedy film produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the sequel to \"Ice Age\" (2002) and the second film in the franchise. The film was directed by Carlos Saldanha, co-director of the first film, and written by Peter Gaulke, Gerry Swallow, and Jim Hecht. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, and Chris Wedge reprise their roles from the first \"Ice Age\" film, with newcomers Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott and Josh Peck joining the cast. In the film, Manny, Sid, and Diego attempt to escape an impending flood, during which Manny finds love.\n\nThe film premiered in Belgium on March 1, 2006, and in the United States on March 31. It was eventually released in 70 countries, with the last release being in China on June 9. \"The Meltdown\" received mixed critical reaction but was a box office success by earning over $660 million. Three more sequels were released — \"\" in 2009, \"\" in 2012 and \"\" in 2016.\n\nManny, Sid, and Diego are currently living in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a dam that is barely holding a massive body of water that could flood the valley to nearly a mile underwater. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them all, but they only have three days to reach it or die. Manny is also having trouble fearing the fact that he may be the last mammoth left.\n\nDuring the evacuation, a glacier that contains two sea reptiles from the Mesozoic era, Cretaceous a \"Cymbospondylus\" and Maelstrom a \"Pliosauroidea\", breaks off. When Manny is briefly separated from them, Diego and Sid encounter two mischievous opossums named Crash and Eddie who drive them nuts by playing Whac-A-Mole with them. Manny is still worried about being the last mammoth alive and his family, who had been killed by humans, but is surprised when he encounters Ellie, a female woolly mammoth who believes she is an opossum and Crash and Eddie's adoptive sister. Sid invites her to tag along with the group to escape the flood, and she brings her brothers. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Sid prompts Diego to encourage him to admit and face his fears - Diego insists that \"fear is for prey\", so Sid points out that Diego is behaving as if he is the water's prey. They discover an area which Ellie recalls as the place where she was adopted. She finally realizes she is a mammoth and also expresses her suspicions about how different she was from other opossums. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests \"saving their species\". Ellie and Manny ultimately make up when they must co-operate to save the group when the ground cracks under their feet. Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths who believe Sid to be a god. Sid lights a fire for them, and believes that he has finally found respect, but they plan to sacrifice him by tossing him into a volcano; Sid narrowly escapes. The next morning, Sid tells the others his experience but none are convinced. After being harassed by vultures, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers, which separates Manny, Sid and Diego from Ellie and her brothers when they argue about which way's safest to go through.\n\nWhen the flood comes, Manny saves Ellie from drowning as she is caught in a cave (due to falling rocks), while Diego overcomes his fear of water to save Sid, Crash and Eddie from drowning. Cretaceous and Maelstrom arrive, but due to Manny's quick thinking, they are finished off by a rock which falls on them, killing them both. The other animals are at the mercy of the water currents. Meanwhile, Scrat climbs up the glacier and at the top sticks the acorn he has into the ice. This forms a crack in the glacier, which widens into a fissure, diverting the flood and saving the animals in the valley; Scrat is then washed away. In the final scene, a herd of mammoths show up, proving mammoths aren't extinct. But Manny and Ellie decide to remain together anyway, taking Sid, Diego and the opossum brothers along. Sid encounters the mini-sloths again - they believe Sid stopped the flood and invite him to be their leader. Diego, surprised to see the mini-sloths are real, convinces Sid to stay with the others, admitting that Sid is a vital part of their 'herd'.\n\nThe epilogue shows Scrat having a near death experience after falling into the fissure. He enters a heaven full of acorns. Suddenly, he finds himself torn away. He unhappily wakes up, having been resuscitated by Sid, who he proceeds to viciously attack.\n\n\nAfter the release of \"Ice Age\" in March 2002, executive producer Chris Meledandri commented on the potential \"Ice Age\" sequel: \"The success of \"Ice Age\" is something that gives us additional momentum. It's too early to say, but it's certainly something we'll explore.\" By June 2002, Blue Sky Studios was already working on the sequel. In 2003, Lori Forte, the producer of the first film, signed a multi-year deal with Fox Feature Films to develop and produce animated films, including a potential \"Ice Age\" sequel. During an interview with Denis Leary in July 2003, he said that he had expressed hope to reprise his role as Diego in the sequel: \"I think there's a story – the people at Fox are working on one right now. I think they're talking about going back into the studios something around late Fall.\" In that same year, 2006 was reported as the planned release year, and by August 2004, its final release date, March 31, 2006, had been set.\n\nInitially developed under the working title of \"Ice Age 2\", it was renamed by June 2005 to \"Ice Age 2: The Meltdown\", but for the film's final release in March 2006, the creators decided to remove the number \"2\", calling it \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\". However, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico, and Australia, its title is promoted as \"Ice Age 2: The Meltdown\". Also, most of the sponsors of the film had the \"2\" in their packaging after the name change (they however did edit the \"2\" out of their TV ads).\n\nCarlos Saldanha, the director of the film, strove to make the characters eyes appear alive and not mechanical. “You want the facial expressions to work. I wanted it to be so that if you looked into their eyes, you would know what they were thinking.” in his own words. The characters, despite being from the last movie, were remodeled for the sequel.\n\nThe score is by John Powell; the soundtrack also features the song \"Food Glorious Food\" from the musical and film \"Oliver!\". Powell composed brand new music for the film that replaced the theme songs from the previous film. Aram Khachaturian's \"Adagio from Spartacus\" is featured during Scrat's Heavenly vision.\n\nIce Age: The Meltdown was composed by John Powell and was released on March 28, 2006 by Varèse Sarabande Records.\n\n\"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" had its world premiere on March 19, 2006, at the Mann's Grauman Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, California. The film was re-released in 3D on October 13, 2014 in China only.\n\nAs an additional marketing ploy a special \"anti-cell\" spot was created with Sid complaining to the audience about a ringing cellular phone. The same was done for \"Brother Bear\", \"I, Robot\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", and \"Robots\".\n\nOn \"Family Guy's\" episode \"Sibling Rivalry\", Scrat is shown trying to take three nuts out of the side of a glacier; Peter shows up and tries to stop him, admonishing the squirrel for stealing, which drives Scrat to subsequently attack Peter. Apart from Peter, the scene was rendered in 3D (\"Family Guy\" is normally drawn in 2D), and Scrat was voiced by Chris Wedge who voices him in the films. The episode originally aired the week before the film opened. Fox aired promotions for the film throughout the evening. During the same evening of this cameo, Sid was hosting the entire FOX line-up, showing up in intermittent times between commercials.\n\nRe-edited scenes of \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" were shown in Airhead candy commercials on several kids' channels and programs, such as the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, ABC Kids on ABC, and more. It shows, in part, that after Scrat defeats a school of piranha, he proudly displays an Airhead packet (replaced by an acorn in the actual film), when suddenly an eagle comes over and swipes it from him.\n\nOne of the posters for the film was a parody of an iPod advertisement, with \"iAge\" replacing \"iPod\" and an acorn replacing an iPod.\n\n\"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD were released in the North America on November 21, 2006 according to the official web store. They were released in the UK on October 23, 2006, and both include a new Scrat short, \"No Time for Nuts\".\n\nThe film exceeded expectations by opening with an $68,033,544 in its first weekend. This was the second biggest opening for a non-summer, non-holiday release, after the $83,848,082 of \"The Passion of the Christ\". But the record for highest grossing weekend for March only lasted a year, due to the $70,885,301 weekend of \"300\". The film grossed a total of $195,330,621 at United States and Canadian box offices, making it the first film in 2006 to pass the $100 million mark. The film has grossed $660,940,780 worldwide and it is the 66th highest-grossing film of all time. \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" was the highest grossing animated film worldwide of 2006, but lost to \"Cars\" for being the highest grossing animated film in North America.\n\nMeledandri, then president of 20th Century Fox Animation, credited the film's successful performance to the studio's strength in global marketing and distribution, the diversity of the crew, and Saldanha's method of using images rather than words to solve creative problems, which helped him realize that the animation of a film is just as important as the story and dialogue, leading him to start Illumination Entertainment with Universal a year later.\n\n\"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" received mixed reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a \"rotten\" rating, with 57% of reviews positive. The consensus statement reads: \"Despite its impressive animation and the hilarious antics of the saber-toothed squirrel Scrat, \"Ice Age 2: The Meltdown\" comes up short on the storytelling front.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, calculated a score of 58, placing it at the high end of the site's \"mixed or average reviews\" category. Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, stating \"the first \"Ice Age\" movie more or less exhausted these characters and their world, and the meltdown doesn't add much.\"\n\nCinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave \"The Meltdown\" an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nA 2006 video and computer game based on the film was developed and published by Vivendi Games, and the Wii version was released shortly after the launch of the system.\n\nThe third \"Ice Age\" film, \"\" was released on July 1, 2009. It was again directed by Carlos Saldanha, and it tells a story of the protagonists discovering a tropical world inhabited by dinosaurs.\n\nThe fourth film, \"\", was released in 3-D on July 13, 2012. It was directed by Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier — the first time without Carlos Saldanha. Scrat's never-ending pursuit of acorns has world-changing consequences, separating Manny, Sid and Diego from the rest, forcing them to stand up to a pirate gang.\n\nThe fifth film, \"\", was released in 3D on July 22, 2016.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2303183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303183", "title": "Australian nationality law", "text": "Australian nationality law\n\nAustralian nationality law determines who is and who is not an Australian citizen. The status of Australian nationality or Australian citizenship was created by the \"Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948\" (in 1973 renamed the \"Australian Citizenship Act 1948\"), which came into force on 26 January 1949. The 1948 Act was amended many times, notably in 1973, 1984, 1986 and 2002. It was replaced by the \"Australian Citizenship Act 2007\", which commenced on 1 July 2007.\n\nOn 13 December 1973, Australia acceded to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.\n\nAustralian citizenship law is administered by the Department of Home Affairs which can issue certificates of citizenship on naturalisation or on request provide other proof or evidence of Australian citizenship. Australian passports are issued to Australian citizens by the Australian Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\nIn Australia, the terms \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" can be used interchangeably, but the term \"citizenship\" (or \"citizen\") is more commonly used, while \"nationality\" is most often used in official documents and forms. In general, a person may acquire citizenship automatically (\"by operation of law\") through birth in Australia or through Australian descent, or by application after a period of residence in Australia. The process of acquiring citizenship by application is referred to as \"naturalisation\".\n\nUntil the passing in Australia of the \"Nationality Act 1920\", Australia's nationality law, like that of other Commonwealth countries, was governed by the English common law concept of a British subject. (See also British nationality law.) The idea that there was such a thing as an Australian nationality as distinct from a British one was considered by the High Court of Australia in 1906 to be a \"novel idea\" to which it was \"not disposed to give any countenance\". The \"British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914\" codified the common law rules. Australia followed with the passing of the \"Nationality Act 1920\", which codified the concept of a British subject in Australia, effective from 1 January 1921. In general, the principles of the 1920 Act and subsequent amendments followed United Kingdom legislation, although there were some differences that could lead to a person being a \"British subject\" solely under Australian law.\n\nThe 1948 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting decided to make major changes in nationality laws throughout the Commonwealth, following Canada's decision to enact its Canadian citizenship law, effective from 1 January 1947. Until then all Commonwealth countries, with the exception of the Irish Free State, had a single nationality status of \"British subject\". It was decided at that conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt a separate national citizenship, while retaining the common status of British subject. The \"Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948\", which came into force on 26 January 1949, gave effect to that arrangement and created the concept of Australian nationality while continuing to be British subjects. However, the status of other (non-Australian) British subjects in Australia differed from the status of those who were not British subjects. Aborigines became Australian citizens under the 1948 Act in the same way as other Australians (though Aborigines were not counted in the Australian population until after a 1967 referendum). The same applied to Torres Strait Islanders and the indigenous population of the Territory of Papua (then a part of Australia).\n\nThe relationship between Australian citizenship and a citizen of the British Empire or Commonwealth continued to evolve. In 1986, the Australia Act 1986 severed almost all of the last remaining constitutional links between the United Kingdom and Australia. Subsequently, in 1988, for the first time, the High Court ruled that anyone who was not an Australian citizen, whether or not a subject of the Monarch of the United Kingdom, was an alien.\n\nThe 1948 Act was amended many times, notably in 1958, 1973, 1984, 1986 and 2002. In 1973 the 1948 Act was renamed the \"Australian Citizenship Act 1948\". On 15 March 2007, the \"Australian Citizenship Act 2007\" received Royal Assent and replaced the 1948 Act, commencing on 1 July 2007.\n\nThe principal milestones in the development of Australian nationality law have been:\n\n\nAustralian citizens enjoy the following rights (subject to certain exceptions):\n\nThe following duties are expected of Australian citizens:\n\nA distinct Australian nationality or citizenship was created on 26 January 1949. Persons who were British subjects on that date would continue to have that status but could in addition apply to acquire the new Australian citizenship if they were:\n\n\nA person could now acquire Australian citizenship even if they also held or obtained the nationality of another Commonwealth country, or if they also held foreign citizenship.\n\nThe term \"British subject\" had a particular meaning in Australian nationality law. The term encompassed all citizens of countries included in the list contained in the \"Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948\". The list of countries was based on, but was not identical with, those countries (and their colonies) which were members of the Commonwealth. The list was amended from time to time as various former colonies became independent countries, but the list in the Act was not necessarily up-to-date as far as to constitute exactly a list of countries in the Commonwealth at any given time. This definition of \"British subject\" meant that, for the purposes of Australian nationality law, citizens of countries which had become republics, such as India, were classified as \"British subjects\".\n\nThe \"Australian Citizenship (Amendment) Act\" 1984 removed the status of \"British subject\" from Australian citizenship law, with effect from 22 November 1984, and British subjects who had not acquired Australian citizenship came to be treated as non-citizen permanent residents. They were not entitled to an Australian passport, although existing passports held by non-citizens continued to be valid until each expired. They continued, and still continue, to have voting rights if they were on the electoral roll immediately before 26 January 1984.\n\nThe status of British subject ceased to apply to a person otherwise entitled but who acquires citizenship of Australia or another Commonwealth country.\n\nA person born in Australia before 25 January 1949 was \"automatically\" a British subject, based on the \"jus soli\" principle, regardless of the status of their parents: children born to visitors or foreigners also acquired citizenship by birth. (The only exception was children of foreign ambassadors, who were immune from local jurisdiction and local duties of allegiance; the children's nationality would be determined by the foreign country's law.) Such persons need to apply for Australian citizenship, otherwise since 20 August 1986 they have the status of permanent resident.\n\nA person born in Australia between 26 January 1949 and 19 August 1986, \"automatically\" acquired Australian citizenship. Until 21 November 1984, such a person had the status of Australian citizen and British subject, but after that date the status of \"British subject\" ceased to exist in Australia.\n\nThe \"jus soli\" principle was abolished from 20 August 1986, with persons born after that date acquiring Australian citizenship by birth only if a descendant of at least one parent who was an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth. The definition of parenthood was tested in \"H v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship\" (2010), where it was held that parenthood does not necessarily require it to be of a biological nature.\n\nA child born in Australia (and who is not otherwise an Australian citizen) and who lives in Australia \"automatically\" acquires Australian citizenship on his or her 10th birthday, if the child has not been granted or otherwise acquired Australian citizenship in the meantime. This occurs \"automatically\" (by operation of law), and applies irrespective of the immigration status of the child or his/her parents.\n\nChildren born in Australia whose parents are stateless and not entitled to any other country's citizenship may in some circumstances apply for and be granted Australian citizenship. 'Baby Ferouz' was born to Rohingya Muslim parents who had fled from Myanmar which did not recognise them as citizens. His parents and siblings were being held at the Nauru Detention Centre, however the family was flown to Brisbane due to complications in pregnancy, with the result that while baby Ferouz was born in Australia, he was deemed to be an unauthorised maritime arrival and could not be given a protection visa. In December 2014, he and his family were given a temporary protection visa which allowed them to be released from immigration detention.\n\nA person born outside Australia to an Australian citizen parent can acquire Australian citizenship in the following ways:\n\nAustralian citizenship by descent is not conferred at birth, and a child born outside Australia to an Australian parent must apply for citizenship. If aged 18 or over, an applicant for Australian citizenship by descent must be of good character.\n\nWhere an Australian parent has lost Australian citizenship before the birth of a child, the child is not eligible for Australian citizenship by descent. However, such a child is eligible for a special \"conferral\" of Australian citizenship (naturalisation) under section 21(6) of the 2007 Act if the Australian citizen parent lost Australian citizenship \"under section 17 of the 1948 Act\" prior to the child's birth. Section 17 concerned \"automatic\" loss of Australian citizenship upon naturalisation in another country as an adult before 4 April 2002. Children of former Australian citizens who lost their Australian citizenship under section 18 (renunciation), section 20 (loss by naturalised citizens who left Australia before 1951) or section 23 (automatic loss as a minor) do not benefit from this concession.\n\nThere is no age limit and those over 18 are eligible to apply.\n\n\"Naturalisation is the process by which one undertakes allegiance to a new sovereign and, often enough, sheds allegiance to another sovereign.\" Between 26 January 1949 and 30 November 1973, British subjects were able to apply for registration as an Australian citizen after one year's residence in Australia as an immigrant, and there was no requirement to attend a citizenship ceremony. Non-British subjects were required to apply for naturalization, which had stricter requirements, including a five-year residency. They were required to attend a citizenship ceremony and swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown. From 1966 they were also obliged to renounce \"all other allegiance\".\n\nThe \"Australian Citizenship Act\" 1973 ended the preferential treatment for British subjects from 1 December 1973. From that date, the same criteria for naturalisation applied to all applicants for citizenship by naturalisation, though the special status of British subject was retained. Also from that date the age of majority for citizenship matters was reduced to eighteen years, so that they could apply for citizenship in their own right. The common residence requirement of three years was reduced to two years from 22 November 1984. The status of British subject was removed from Australian citizenship law, with effect on 1 May 1987. (That status had been discontinued in British law on 1 January 1983.)\n\nPeople who became permanent residents from 1 July 2007 must have been lawfully resident in Australia for four years before applying for citizenship by conferral. The \"lawfully resident\" test could be satisfied by any period of lawful stay in Australia including a stay on a temporary or bridging visa, but the applicant must:\n\n\nChildren aged under 18 can be included in the application of a responsible parent. The standard residence requirements do not apply to such children. There are some exceptions to the standard requirements, including:\n\nThose who were present in Australia as permanent residents before 1 July 2007 remain subject to the previous residence requirement (in force since 1984, e.g. resident for 2 years) on any application for conferral made before 1 July 2010 – they must:\n\nIn general, applicants aged 16 or over must attend a citizenship ceremony and make a pledge of commitment, except for:\n\nFrom 1 October 2007, most applicants for Australian citizenship by conferral aged between 18 and 60 must pass the Australian citizenship test, which focuses on Australia's values, history, and traditional and national symbols.\n\nPrior to 4 April 2002, many Australian citizens lost Australian citizenship through acquiring another citizenship, or being the child of a parent who did so. From that date, the scope to lose Australian citizenship is more limited. In any case the person must have another citizenship to revert to, to avoid creating a stateless person.\n\nBetween 26 January 1949 and 3 April 2002, an adult Australian generally lost Australian citizenship automatically upon acquisition of another citizenship by a 'voluntary and formal act', with the following rules:\n\nSection 17 of the 1948 Citizenship Act was repealed with effect from 4 April 2002. Although the repeal was not retroactive, since 1 July 2007 former Australian citizens who lost citizenship because of the section are generally able to apply for resumption of Australian citizenship.\n\nChildren did not lose Australian citizenship by virtue of their own actions, but could lose Australian citizenship if a parent lost Australian citizenship:\n\nLoss of Australian citizenship occurred under section 23 of the 1948 Act. Even after the repeal of section 17 of the Act in 2002, section 23 was left in place. It remains possible for an Australian child to lose Australian citizenship this way. However, since the repeal of section 17, this is much less common and in general only applies where a parent is deprived of Australian citizenship, or renounces Australian citizenship under section 18 of the Act.\n\nUnder the \"Australian Citizenship Act 2007\", in force from 1 July 2007, an Australian child no longer automatically loses Australian citizenship based on a parent's actions. However, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has the right to deprive a child of Australian citizenship in these circumstances on a discretionary basis.\n\nBetween 26 January 1956 and 7 October 1958, a naturalised Australian citizen lost Australian citizenship if resident outside Australia or New Guinea for a continuous period of 7 years without registering annually a declaration of intent to retain Australian citizenship. This occurred by virtue of section 20 of the \"Nationality and Citizenship Act\" 1948 which was repealed on 8 October 1958. The provision had the potential to create stateless persons.\n\nSince 1 July 2007, persons who lost Australian citizenship because of the provision may apply to resume Australian citizenship, subject only to being of good character.\n\nBurma became independent outside the Crown's dominions on 4 January 1948. In the \"Burma Independence Act 1948\" the United Kingdom legislated to remove \"British subject\" status on that date from:\n\n\nSuch persons who were domiciled in the United Kingdom or \"His Majesty's dependencies\" were given two years to elect to remain British.\n\nAustralian legislation was not updated at the time and hence the \"common law\" applied. British subjects connected with Burma lost British subject status under Australian law only if resident in Burma. As a result, some British subjects connected with Burma acquired Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949 if resident in Australia for 5 years at that point.\n\nOn 29 July 1950, the \"Nationality and Citizenship (Burmese) Act 1950\" removed the discrepancy between Australian and British law on the status of persons connected with Burma. As a result, Australian citizenship was lost on 29 July 1950 by persons who had had British nationality removed from them under the UK legislation in 1948, and persons descended from or married to such persons. Such persons had until 29 July 1952 (two years from the date of commencement of the Act) to register a declaration of intention to remain a British subject. If such a declaration was registered, the person was deemed never to have lost Australian citizenship.\n\nSection 19 of the 1948 Act stated: \"An Australian citizen who, under the law of a foreign country, is a national or citizen of that country and serves in the armed forces of a country at war with Australia shall, upon commencing so to serve, cease to be an Australian citizen.\"\n\nDespite being involved in a number of armed conflicts since 1949, Australia has not declared a formal state of war on another sovereign nation in that period, and hence section 19 has not operated up to now. It has been re-enacted as section 35 of the 2007 Act.\n\nA Australian citizen may be deprived of Australian citizenship under section 34 of the 2007 Act in the following circumstances:\n\n\nAny Australian citizen may also be deprived of Australian citizenship by virtue of the same section in these circumstances:\n\n\nAn Australian citizen whose citizenship ceases while they are in the Australian migration zone is taken to have been immediately granted an ex-citizen visa; this is a permanent visa to remain in, but not re-enter, Australia: Migration Act 1958, s 35. They need not be told that they have lost Australian citizenship, nor that they now hold this visa. If they leave Australia and wish to re-enter, they will need a Resident Return Visa or other permanent visa. Since 2013, when the Australian mainland was excised from the migration zone, the migration zone has effectively ceased to exist, so that the automatic granting of the ex-citizen visa no longer applies.\n\nIn any event, an ex-citizen visa may be cancelled on character grounds and the person then removed from Australia; this is likely where citizenship has ceased because it has been revoked under section 21 of the Act.\n\nSince 1 July 2007, a former Australian citizen can resume Australian citizenship if:\n\n\nChildren born to former Australian citizens (only those who lost Australian citizenship by virtue of \"section 17\" of the Act) after loss of the parent's citizenship, and before the parent resumed citizenship, may be considered for a \"grant\" of Australian citizenship (whether aged under or over 18). There is no requirement for the parent to resume citizenship. This policy was put in place by Ministerial policy on 13 October 2003 for children under 18 and extended in the 2007 Act to those aged 18 or over.\n\nSome former Australian citizens may qualify for a Resident Return Visa to return to Australia as permanent residents. After 12 months as a permanent resident in Australia, it is normally possible for a former Australian citizen to apply for Australian citizenship.\n\nAustralian citizenship is acquired \"automatically\" on adoption in the following circumstances:\n\n\nIn all other circumstances an application for grant of Australian citizenship must be made for the child.\n\nOn 8 May 2005, the Minister for Citizenship announced a policy change to require all child applicants for grant of Australian citizenship by adoption to hold an adoption visa, or other permanent visa. However, it does not appear that there is any requirement for the child to be physically resident in Australia.\n\nThe \"Australian Citizenship Act\" 2007 additionally allows for simplified registration of a person as an Australian citizen where that person was adopted overseas in accordance with the Hague Adoption Convention\".\n\nAn Australian passport does not, in itself, entitle the holder to enter another country. To enter another country, the traveller must comply with the visa and entry requirements of the other countries to be visited, which vary from country to country and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history or many other factors.\n\nAccording to the 2019 Henley Passport Index, Australian passport holders can visit 181 countries without a visa or by being issued a visa on arrival.\n\nWith effect from 4 April 2002, there are no restrictions (under Australian law) on Australians holding the citizenship of other countries.\n\nPrior to 4 April 2002, it was still possible for Australians in some circumstances to hold dual citizenship, including:\n\nHolding a foreign passport does not in itself cause loss of Australian citizenship.\n\nHowever, all Australian citizens are required to use an Australian passport when entering and leaving Australia. This provision is intended to prevent immigration-related delays while a traveller's status is confirmed, as an Australian citizen cannot be granted a visa to enter Australia. However, Australian citizens have never been prosecuted simply for travelling on the \"wrong\" passport, provided all other immigration requirements are satisfied. Australians with compelling reasons can apply for an Australian Declaratory Visa for their foreign passport, allowing them to use it for travel to and from Australia.\n\nHolding dual nationality continues to be a bar to being elected to the Australian Parliament. In the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, several members of Parliament were found to have been ineligible for election owing to their being dual citizens, and others are possibly ineligible.\n\nNew Zealanders were included in the definition of British subject in the 1948 Act and hence many New Zealanders resident in Australia on 26 January 1949 became entitled to acquire Australian citizenship. There was no bar to New Zealanders acquiring Australian citizenship as well as New Zealand citizenship under the equivalent New Zealand legislation, \"British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948\" (NZ). Persons classified as British subjects were entitled to the same rights as Australian citizens, but were not classified as permanent residents. New Zealanders could become Australian citizens by registration or naturalisation, without a requirement to achieve permanent resident status, until February 2001. Effective 22 November 1984, the status of \"British subject\" was removed from Australian citizenship law, and British subjects who had not acquired Australian citizenship were classified as \"non-citizen permanent residents\". New Zealand citizens arriving after February 2001 have been required to apply for and obtain Australian permanent resident status before becoming eligible for Australian citizenship.\n\nChildren born in Australia before 27 February 2001 to New Zealand parents have generally been Australian citizens by birth. However, those born between 20 August 1986 and 31 August 1994 did not acquire Australian citizenship by birth, which is due to a technicality in the 1986 legislation which limited the acquisition of Australian citizenship to children of Australian citizens and permanent residents, which was not corrected until 1994. These restrictions do not apply to children of a person who was an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth. In addition, a child born in Australia to two parents who are New Zealand citizens by descent is entitled to Australian citizenship. This is because under New Zealand nationality law, New Zealand citizens by descent cannot pass on New Zealand citizenship by descent, therefore rendering the child otherwise stateless. Special rules apply to cases in which the New Zealand parent is a diplomat, official guest, a visiting member of the armed forces, or has entered Australia on the passport of another country.\n\nChildren born in Australia to New Zealand parents automatically acquire Australian citizenship on their 10th birthday, if ordinarily resident in Australia until age 10, if they had not already acquired Australian citizenship by birth or naturalisation.\n\nPrior to 1975, what is now Papua New Guinea was divided into two legal entities under common Australian administration. The Territory of Papua was an external territory of Australia itself, while the Territory of New Guinea was never an Australian territory in a legal sense, but rather a Trust Territory under Australian administration.\n\nAs a result, those born or naturalised in Territory of Papua acquired Australian citizenship on the same basis as any other part of Australia. However, those of indigenous descent were not automatically entitled to reside in the rest of Australia, despite holding Australian citizenship. It was possible in some circumstances for such persons to apply for and be granted a right of residence in mainland Australia.\n\nPersons connected with Territory of New Guinea were Australian protected persons rather than Australian citizens and for nationality purposes the territory was considered not to be part of Australia.\n\nPapua New Guinea became independent on 16 September 1975. Australian citizens connected with the Territory of Papua lost Australian citizenship on that date if they became citizens of Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG citizenship was generally conferred only on those born in PNG who had at least two grandparents of indigenous descent, and:\n\nPersons of non-indigenous descent who acquired Australian citizenship by connection with PNG before independence generally still retain it.\n\nUnder the Australian Citizenship Act, only a person born \"outside\" Australia is eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent. This has caused an anomaly in that former Australian citizens born in the former Territory of Papua (not New Guinea) before independence, and who lost Australian citizenship on independence in 1975, are unable to recover it through this route even if they have a parent born in mainland Australia.\n\nThis has been the subject of litigation in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia, which have ruled that the definition of \"Australia\" includes the former Territory of Papua prior to independence. This rules out the possibility of Australian citizenship by descent for a person born in Papua.\n\nHowever, section 21(7) of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 allows certain persons born before independence in Papua to be granted Australian citizenship, where such a person has a parent born in Australia (as currently defined).\n\nThe wording of the Oath of Allegiance taken by newly naturalising Australian citizens has changed over time. In 1973 the Oath's wording was:\n\nAustralia, however, never required new citizens to formally renounce their former citizenship under the law of that country. An equivalent wording was available in the form of a non-religious Affirmation for those who preferred.\n\nIn 1986 the wording was changed to:\n\nIn 1994 the Oath was replaced with a Pledge of Commitment to Australia:\n\nAll new citizens have the choice of making the pledge with (Pledge 1) or without (Pledge 2) the words 'under God'.\n\nThere are cases where citizens need to show documentary evidence of their citizenship.\n\nEmployers are required to check working rights when providing a job, so an Australian citizen needs to show evidence of their citizenship. According to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection this is either a valid Australian passport or simply a birth certificate. Photo identity is also required.\n\nSome employers, especially the government (e.g. NSW Police Force, and Human Services Victoria) have adopted more stringent requirements similar to the Passport requirement below.\n\nCentrelink or Medicare may require proof of citizenship when applying for benefits under their programs especially the first time. Generally an Australian passport or a birth certificate along with photo identity will suffice, or for newborns, a \"Newborn Child Declaration\" issued by the hospital.\n\nAccording to the Australian Passport Office, the following documents normally constitute evidence of Australian citizenship:\n\n\nPhoto identity is generally required when applying for a passport.\n\nA \"Certificate of Australian Citizenship\" is recognised as an identity document and can be used as proof of citizenship. It is generally issued once only to naturalised citizens at a citizenship ceremony (unless adopted by a citizen). It is A4 in size, has the full name, and date of birth of the holder, has a number on the front and back, and is signed by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection or responsible minister at the time of issuance, and is dated the date of the ceremony.\n\nAustralian citizens who do not have a citizenship certificate, have lost their original certificate, or wish to have a single document proving their citizenship, may apply for a \"Certificate of Evidence of Australian Citizenship\". Children born overseas, with one parent born overseas, may apply for an \"Australian citizenship by descent extract document\".\n\nChildren naturalised as part of a parent's application for Australian citizenship before 1 July 2002 did not receive individual citizenship certificates. Instead, their details were included on the reverse of their parent's certificate. Such children can be issued with individual Certificates of Evidence of Australian Citizenship.\n\nAs citizenship documentation does not generally have a photo, in many cases separate photo identity is required to associate the citizenship documentation to the individual presenting. For this reason the Australian Passport provides a convenient document for proving both citizenship and photo identity in one document.\n\nWhen Australia created Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949, not all British subjects connected with Australia became Australian citizens on that date. The most notable exceptions were:\n\n\nwhere the child or woman had not entered Australia with a permanent entry permit before 26 January 1949.\n\nUnder the terms of section 12(4) of the British Nationality Act 1948:\n\n\nPersons acquiring CUKC would have retained it upon a later acquisition of Australian citizenship. However they would only be British citizens today if they had obtained a 'right of abode' in the UK under the terms of the Immigration Act 1971, such as by having a UK-born grandparent. Otherwise they would be British Overseas citizens.\n\nBritish subjects without citizenship would have retained that status only if they did not acquire a Commonwealth nationality (or Irish citizenship) before 1983, or any citizenship from 1983 or later.\n\nBritish Overseas citizens and British subjects may register as British citizens if they have no other nationality (and have not lost another nationality since 4 July 2002), but otherwise do not have an automatic right to live in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, Australians are Commonwealth citizens and entitled to certain rights in the UK:\n\n\nSimilar rights accrue in some other Commonwealth jurisdictions.\n\nUnder the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australian citizens and permanent residents are automatically granted a New Zealand residence class visa on arrival in New Zealand, provided they:\n\nThe visa entitles Australian citizens and permanent residents to live, work and study in New Zealand indefinitely, and expires once the Australian citizen or permanent resident leaves New Zealand.\n\nMost non-citizens travelling to Australia must obtain a visa prior to travel. The only exceptions to this rule are members of the British royal family, who do not require a visa, and holders of both New Zealand citizenship and a New Zealand passport, who may apply for a Special Category Visa on arrival according to the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement.\n\n\"Australia\" means Australia together with its Territories\n\n\"British subject\" means a person connected with a Commonwealth country (not just the United Kingdom). The phrase was used in Australian law until 30 April 1987. See British subject for a more general description of the use of the term.\n\n\n"}

Skurkis, but was raised in Connecticut. She has a brother, Jeffrey. She graduated from Plainville High School in Plainville, Connecticut. After graduation she moved to Los Angeles, California; however she soon found herself moving between homes in both states to attend school and seek work.\n\nMoon had aspirations to do cartoon voice-overs and took classes. She briefly attended the Connecticut School of Broadcasting to become an MTV VJ, but Moon found herself preoccupied going on tour with Rob Zombie. When Rob Zombie's band White Zombie disbanded and he went solo, he took Moon on as a dancer where she also choreographed routines and created costumes for the tour.\n\nMoon has appeared in eleven of Zombie's solo music videos and an additional four previous to that when he fronted White Zombie. She most famously starred in the \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\"-themed music video \"Living Dead Girl\". Moon appeared on the cover of the single for \"Living Dead Girl\" (1998), Zombie's remix album \"American Made Music to Strip By\" (1999), and the cover of the single for \"Demon Speeding\" (2002). Aside from Zombie's work, she also appeared in Black Label Society's video for \"Stillborn\" and Prong's video for \"Rude Awakening\". In 2003, Moon co-starred in her husband's first feature film, \"House of 1000 Corpses\", as Vera-Ellen \"Baby\" Firefly, but previous to that, she claims that she had never had aspirations of becoming an actress. As Moon explains her character in that film, \"Baby is the angelic-looking bait to get the victims.\" Moon starred alongside genre actors Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and Karen Black. In 2004, she had a brief appearance in the Tobe Hooper film \"Toolbox Murders\" starring Angela Bettis, the only film she has been in not directed by Zombie.\n\nMoon reprised her role as Baby Firefly in the 2005 sequel to \"House of 1000 Corpses\", titled \"The Devil's Rejects\". \"The Devil's Rejects\" was financially successful, recouping its roughly $7 million budget during its opening weekend, going on to earn over $16 million and better received by critics than its predecessor. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of a possible four stars. Ebert wrote, \"If you are a hardened horror-movie fan capable of appreciating skill and wit in the service of the deliberately disgusting, 'The Devil's Rejects' may exercise a certain strange charm.\" Moon was awarded Spike TV's Scream Awards award for \"Most Vile Villain\" alongside co-stars Haig, Moseley and Leslie Easterbrook for their portrayal of the Firefly family. Following that, she was awarded a Fuse/Fangoria Chainsaw Award for best duo with her co-star Moseley.\n\nMoon designed a clothing line, Total Skull, which debuted at the end of May 2006. She explains, \"The phrase 'total skull' to me means awesome, rad, the best of the best.\"\n\nIn 2007, Moon starred as Eva Krupp in a short faux trailer segment for the film \"Grindhouse\", directed by Zombie and titled \"Werewolf Women of the SS\". She also appeared in her husband's remake of the 1978 classic \"Halloween\", portraying Deborah Myers, the mother of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. At the time, it was the highest grossing overall film in the \"Halloween\" franchise. Moon reprised her character in the sequel \"Halloween II\", which was released on August 28, 2009.

{"id": "2303220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303220", "title": "Bobby Ologun", "text": "Bobby Ologun\n\nHe is currently working as the narrator for .\n\nOlogun is the third brother in a family of thirty-one brothers and sisters. After graduating from a Nigerian university, he came to Japan as an assistant to a trading company which his father manages. In 2001, he worked a part-time job in the kitchen of a cafe in Daikanyama, Shibuya, while also first appearing in Sanma Akashiya's television program \"Sanma's Super Karakuri-TV\" on Tokyo Broadcasting System as a non-Tarento interviewee. By the end of the year, he was regular on the popular skits featured on Karakuri-TV, \"The Funniest Language School\", as a student.\n\nForeigners who have trouble speaking Japanese are often featured in Japanese variety shows, which may explain the immediate success of Ologun. His frequent confusion (or feigned confusion) quickly made him an instant star on the Karakuri-TV show.\n\nSome of his famous mistakes were:\n\nOlogun also stands out for using politically incorrect, racially-charged humor, often capitalizing on stereotypes of African Americans. He and fighting celebrity Bob Sapp were criticized for the perceived racism on their performances, but they defended it as part of the Japanese's cultural views towards humor. Ologun and Sapp were reportedly hugely popular among African people living in Japan.\n\nOne of the running skits on Sanma's \"Super Karakuri TV\" featured Ologun attempting a variety of different jobs and skills in which he had no previous experience (he succeeded Tamao Nakamura in these skit performances). Inspired from watching Bob Sapp vs Tarō Akebono on K-1 Dynamite!! on New Year's Eve in 2003, Ologun tried judo on Karakuri-TV. Karakuri-TV's emcee, Sanma Akashiya (who had previously watched a VTR of Ologun struggling in the martial art and half-jokingly said, \"Bobby might be able to take part in a combat sport event at the end of the year.\"), in reference to the New Year's Eve supershows put on by K-1, PRIDE, and Antonio Inoki's now defunct BOM-BA-YE promotion. As a result, he tried various full contact combat sports on the program.\n\nBy February 2004, he was initiated into the Pancrase stable, \"GRABAKA\" and studied under its founder, Sanae Kikuta. In March of that same year, he experienced a sparring match with MMA and Jiu-Jitsu legend Royce Gracie. He lost, but Ologun performed better than expected, as he was able to cut Gracie and make him bleed from his forehead. In a joke turned reality, he faced French kickboxer Cyril Abidi in K-1 Dynamite!! at the Osaka Dome on December 31, 2004. Billed as \"The World's Most Dangerous Newcomer\", Ologun won by three-round decision, and scored a surprise victory. This match was the only pure MMA rules bout on that night's card, giving Ologun a slight advantage due to his training and the fact that his opponent, while an accomplished kickboxer, wasn't prepared for MMA style fighting. Abidi was a last minute addition to the fight, Ologun's original opponent Mike Bernardo had to withdraw due to an injury. Additionally, there was confusion to the rule system of the bout as the captions showed it to be the general kickboxing rules but ended up as an MMA contest. Abidi was admonished for actions Ologun was doing repeatedly in the fight, such as mounted punches, which led fighting pundits to believe the fight was fixed. Abidi himself hinted the fight was fixed in a post fight interview. The Japanese media, which focused quite a bit of time on fighting events such as K-1 and PRIDE, soon dubbed Ologun Saikyō no Shirōto (The Strongest Amateur).\n\nOlogun's next fight was against former Yokozuna, Akebono at K-1 Dynamite!! on New Year's Eve 2005. Akebono, who had a fighting record of 1-9 entering the fight, fiercely attacked Ologun in the first and second rounds. However, Ologun steadily fought his way to another three-round decision.\n\nHis next fight was a kickboxing match in Sapporo at K-1 Revenge on July 30, 2006, where he fought Asian GP champion Yusuke Fujimoto. Ologun earned the ire of the referee with unsportsmanlike conduct as he tripped and pushed over Fujimoto repeatedly, trying to punch at him afterward, and going for sucker punches after gesturing for a break, all of which led to a yellow card. At the end of the 3rd round, he tripped Fujimoto one last time and then stood over him in an unsportsmanlike fashion. Added to the knockdown he suffered in the first round, he lost his first fight and his first under K-1 rules by unanimous decision.\n\nAt K-1 Dynamite, New Year's Eve 2006, during the K-1 HERO'S was set face the 7'2\", 360 lb. Choi Hong-man. Choi, on the Hero's website, warned Ologun about his in-ring behavior, saying (in Japanese), \"Bobby had better grow up.\", and, \"If he makes me mad, he's going to the hospital.\". In the subsequent fight, Ologun immediately tried a flying kick to Choi's head, but missed. This allowed Choi to capitalize and punch Ologun repeatedly in the head, leading to a stoppage of the bout after 16 seconds into the first round.\n\nOlogun's latest fight was on the next year's K-1 Dynamite show against the returning Bob Sapp. Once again, he was defeated easily by his larger and more powerful opponent by Technical Knock Out in the first round.\n\nOn January 25, 2006, Ologun allegedly assaulted Katsuyuki Itō, the president of the entertainment agency, R&A Promotions, to which Ologun belongs in Shibuya. Police deliberated whether to send prosecution documents to court in lieu of the charges. According to the investigation, Ologun reportedly seized the president's clothes and acted violently by throwing around furniture because of a dispute over payment. John Muwete Muruaka, who is famous in Japan as the former private secretary of the scandalized Representative Muneo Suzuki and a member of the same agency as Ologun, happened to be there and tried to stop the fight, resulting in a scuffle between the two men.\n\nOlogun later denied that the incident had happened saying, \"I didn't hit anybody. On the contrary, I was hit by Muruaka\" at a news conference on the same day. The official explanation presented later was that Ologun was being paid per the stipulations of his contract, but he did not fully understand the Japanese legalese in it, so he made a deal which he did not have fully understand.\n\nAt the same time, it was found that he had lied about his age when the police checked his driver's license in Harajuku police station. He claimed to have been born in 1973 until then, but he was actually born in 1966. He has denied lying about his age. Ologun now uses this incident as part of his gimmick by lying about his age on his blog and on television shows as he maintains his fictitious 1973 birth year.\n\nHe was banned from appearing on Japanese television for three months and was confined to his quarters from January to April 2006 by the geinokai following the assault incident. He has since returned to television, but his appearances and bookings have been sparse as compared to before the incident. This was believed to be because the talent agency that held his contract, R&A Promotions, was not sending any jobs his way due to the bad publicity surrounding the incident. Ologun was still under contract to R&A until December 2007. For that reason, and even though he was under contract and the legality of his actions were questionable, in May 2006, Ologun announced the start of his own independent talent agency, Alemco Productions.

It comprises three components, \"Core\", \"Media Player\", and \"Server\". Alluvium allows video and audio programming to be broadcast over the Internet using swarming technology. It is powered by Onion Networks' Swarmcast, and is notable for its incorporation of server-side time-based playlists, and client software which examines those playlists and begins streaming content from the server(and available peers) per that schedule, simplifying the creation of continuous-broadcast video and audio.\n\nAlluvium is a technology for low-cost streaming media broadcasts. It differs in method from server-to-client streaming servers such as icecast, Real Server, and QuickTime Streaming Server. It requires only a standard web server and client software. No additional modules or CGI scripts are required for its operation.\n\nThe web server handles static files: content, and the playlist(s). The Alluvium playlist file is a text file, residing on the web server, written in the Alluvium playlist format, which is based on the RSS 1.0 news format. The playlist file specifies the play order of URLs that can be hosted anywhere on the web. All RSS tags used are standard tags from existing schemas. An Alluvium playlist file can be generated using the Broadcaster playlist generation tool.\n\nThe web server is configured to deliver Alluvium playlists with MIME type \"Content-Type: application/x-alluvium\" for files with the extension \".rss\"\n\nThe client software, running on each listener's computer, scans through a playlist file until it finds an entry which is scheduled for the current time, then fetches that media. Files are downloaded using the Open Content Network (OCN) utilizing \"Swarmcast\" swarming download technology. After the first file download has started, the client immediately sends it to a locally generated icecast-compatible stream. The client's media player can then be directed to the local stream and listen to it exactly as though it was a normal icecast stream.\n\nThe client software first checks with the OCN gateway, which stores special headers for all of the files being distributed through the OCN. If the gateway doesn't know about a particular URL, it will fetch the necessary information from the URL and then cache it. The information stored by the gateway contains information needed to swarm download the file such as a hashtree.\n\nAmong the information obtained by the client from the gateway is a list of addresses for other clients who are also downloading or have recently downloaded the file. Clients download multiple parts of the file simultaneously from each other. When a certain part of the file is unavailable from other clients, a client will fetch it from the original source URL and then share that part with the other clients, minimizing the load on the server which stores the content files. The majority of data transfer happens between peers. Priority for downloading is given to chunks earlier in the file, so that file playback can happen immediately.\n\nThis swarming architecture offers savings in bandwidth and processor usage. Because most transfers happen between listeners, the source server has much less load. Also, unlike icecast, servers which serve files for Alluvium stations do not decode the files, so broadcasts can be done from low-cost, obsolete hardware with sufficiently fast I/O and network speeds.\n\nAlluvium was developed as part of the Tristero project, hosted at Sourceforge, by Brandon Wiley. The source code, still in beta, is available as part of the Tristero project at tristero.cvs.sourceforge.net\n\nAlluvium was unveiled at CodeCon 2 in February 2003, generating interest in the peer-to-peer, open source, and streaming radio communities. In 2004, CodeCon 3 was broadcast live using Alluvium 2.0.\n\nAlluvium was further developed and incorporated into software developed at and named after ActLab.TV, a peercasted TV and radio service operated by the ActLab at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n"}

{"id": "2303238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303238", "title": "Anton Arcane", "text": "Anton Arcane\n\nAnton Arcane is a DC Comics supervillain who first appeared in \"Swamp Thing\" #2 (January 1973), and was created by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson. He is the archenemy of the Swamp Thing, the protagonist of the comics.\n\nArcane is a scientist whose obsession with gaining immortality has led him to create monstrous creatures known as \"Un-Men\", as well as other monstrous biogenetic experimentations involving the dead. He was able to resurrect his deceased brother Gregori as the Patchwork Man. He is also a skilled magician, which he is able to channel through his horrific experiments.\n\nLiving in the mountains of Europe with his niece Abigail, Arcane is introduced after he discovers and lures the plant-based hero to his castle home. Arcane sought to use his scientific and magical abilities to transform his body into the Swamp Thing's form, while changing the Swamp Thing back into Alec Holland. At first very grateful to be human again, Alec soon overheard Arcane discussing his evil intentions now that he could carry them out. Alec then succeeds in breaking the spell Arcane cast, and sacrifices his humanity, so Arcane becomes a frail old man again. Pursued by the Swamp Thing, Arcane fell to his death, only to be resurrected by his Un-Men in a new body. He then attacked the Swamp Thing twice more before truly dying, the first time as a hulking corpse-like Un-Man (only to be destroyed by the vengeful ghosts of African-American slaves who had possessed his Un-Men) and later as an insect-like cyborg piloting a massive dragonfly-like vehicle that is actually a tesseract (i.e., its interior is larger than its exterior). It is after his third death that his soul was consigned to Hell.\n\nArcane's soul later escaped from Hell and ultimately helped to summon the demon Monkey King into the world.\n\nAfter a fight with Abigail that culminated in her leaving on foot to find the Swamp Thing, Matt Cable (Abigail's husband) had an attack of conscience and drove after her. He had been drinking heavily and wound up crashing his car, leaving him mortally wounded. Ultimately Arcane managed to possess Cable's body, and with it gained access to Cable's godlike power.\n\nIn this body, he masquerades as Cable, claiming that he has a new job at a company called Blackriver Recorporations and is buying a mansion for them to live. Arcane combined his own magic with Cable's inherent psychic powers to alter reality and the employees of Blackriver Recorporations were the resurrected souls of deceased serial killers returned from Hell. He finally revealed himself, tormenting his niece and causing havoc and insanity by altering reality on a massive scale. For miles around natural and unnatural disasters occurred, people succumbed to homicidal instincts and the resurrected serial killers returned to killing.\n\nHe once again battled the Swamp Thing, accompanied by monstrous forms resembling Un-Men, after killing Abigail and condemning her soul to Hell, all the while declaring Earth as his now.\n\nIt was during this battle that Arcane found that the Swamp Thing was a plant elemental and thus possessed semi-magical abilities, allowing the Swamp Thing to combat him on a more even ground. The battle was enough for Matthew Cable to regain control of his body, and Arcane was exorcised directly back to Hell. Cable used his awakened power to resurrect Abigail's body, but not having sufficient power to repair himself, became comatose and finally died, whereupon he became Matthew, a raven living within the Dreaming.\n\nArcane next appears as a demon, having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell. He attacks Swamp Thing yet again, only to be defeated. In a later episode, Arcane temporarily repents of his evil ways after having briefly found God, who eventually banishes him back to Hell. Arcane is tortured by the demon Josephine, whom he seduces into helping him escape. The Swamp Thing defeats the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it is revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being is pregnant.\n\nIn the wake of \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Anton Arcane is a regular antagonist in the monthly \"Swamp Thing\" comics. After Abigail was able to fight off the mental control of Sethe, Sethe revives Anton Arcane from the dead. as the avatar of the Black (a.k.a. the Rot), after which he tries to take over the Red (colliding with Animal Man as well) and the Green. Anton also has a son named William Arcane and Abigail is his daughter in this timeline.\n\nDuring Animal Man and the Swamp Thing's one year in the Rot, Anton Arcane and the forces of the Rot were able to take over parts of Earth. It was mentioned by Frankenstein that Anton Arcane had imprisoned someone beneath Metropolis. When the forces of the Red and the forces of the Green converge outside of Anton Arcane's castle, Anton Arcane unleashes corrupted versions of Maxine Baker and Abigail Arcane. Anton Arcane and the Rot's conquest of Earth is thwarted and undone when Maxine breaks the hold of the remaining Hunter's Three on her.\n\nAfter being defeated by the Swamp Thing, Arcane is put in a Hell specifically made for him by the Parliament of Decay when nothing ever rots and all is forever pure. Abigail, as the new avatar of the Rot, comes to him demanding information about her mother. Arcane reveals that when she was a baby she already had power over the Rot and she accidentally killed her by 'filling' her with the Rot. To make him talk Abigail lets him feel rot, but she now says he will never escape his Hell and will never touch rot again. Arcane says that when he touched it when she gave it to him, he became stronger than he had been in ages and he will escape and take revenge on both her and Alec Holland. As she teleports away, Arcane rips out one of his eyes and throws it in the portal. On Earth, a boy is about to eat an apple when it turns rotten. He throws it away and Arcane's eye appears in it.\n\nIn \"Swamp Thing\" (vol. 5) #36, when the Swamp Thing goes in the Rot to warn Abigail about the new realm of machines, she initially assumes that he is there because of Arcane, who has escaped. It is eventually shown that he has returned to Earth, but since he is not the avatar of the Rot, he can only gain strength from consuming rotten items, like corpses and garbage, and as such is terribly weakened. He joins forces with the new realm of Metal, which promises him the power that he lost, and his power does grow greatly in this time. He later poisons the Green from within, when the Swamp Thing is weakened in an attempt to destroy it, but this fails when all the avatars of the Green are awakened and use their power to cleanse the Green to its original state. Abigail challenges Arcane in the final war against Metal, and while she has the upper hand, Arcane eventually escapes. \n\nIn \"\", it is revealed that five years in the future, a series of events conspired to ensure that all avatars swore to stay off of Earth and within their own realms to prevent chaos. Arcane only agreed to this if he was allowed to bind himself to Abigail forever, as seen when his left hand and her right are completely fused in a twisted embrace and when he calls her his \"daughter-wife\". In doing so, he allowed himself to leech off her power, as the true avatar of the Rot, and ensuring that the Swamp Thing could not fight him, without risking harm or death to the one he loved. However, the Swamp Thing has made the decision to destroy the Rot, using the power of a Life through a White Lantern Ring. Arcane attempts to dissuade him, by citing the necessity of death and rot, but the Swamp Thing counters it by saying that fungi/the Grey and bacteria/the Divided have already decided to take over the role of rot, while Metal will keep them in check. Arcane then tries to give up Abigail, but the Swamp Thing believes that there is enough life in her to let her survive and in the worst case, death is better than the Hell that she lives in. Arcane briefly tries to fight back, but Abigail makes her move to distract him, long enough for the Swamp Thing to activate the White Lantern ring and bringing about the death of Anton Arcane.\n\nAnton Arcane possesses genius-level intellect. He possesses the knowledge of creation of synthetic organs and skin, through which he made his Un-Men. He initially wanted to create a body and transfer his consciousness into it so he could make himself immortal within a tireless form instead of in his normal aged, worn body. He also possessed many arcane artifacts. He possesses necromancy which enables him to control the dead.\nIn \"The New 52\", Arcane was brought in as the avatar of the Rot just as Alec Holland is the avatar of the Green. As the avatar he could manipulate rot, death and decay to his will. His main objective was to simply help the spread of rot, but he caused a wave of carnage, as he thought that killing was the best sacrifice for the Rot. He then found a way of allowing rot in a living being, causing decay before death. When the Swamp Thing and Animal Man are trapped within the Rot, Arcane uses this 'living' rot on everyone, except those who have a strong enough connection to the Red (animals) or the Green (plants), such as Poison Ivy or the Man-Bat. There are ways to prevent the living rot, such as using the Man-Bat serum, but only if it is used before being completely controlled by it. These rot zombies can be weakened or even killed with Alec Holland's bio-restorative formula. Arcane's new Un-Men were normal people who gave themselves to the Rot.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2303248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303248", "title": "Arimaspi", "text": "Arimaspi\n\nThe Arimaspi (also Arimaspian, Arimaspos, Arimaspoi, , Αριμασποί) were a legendary tribe of one-eyed people of northern Scythia who lived in the foothills of the Riphean Mountains, variously identified with the Ural Mountains or the Carpathians. All tales of their struggles with the gold-guarding griffins in the Hyperborean lands near the cave of Boreas, the North Wind (\"Geskleithron\"), had their origin in a lost work by Aristeas, reported in Herodotus.\n\nThe Arimaspi were described by Aristeas of Proconnesus in his lost archaic poem \"Arimaspea\". Proconnesus is a small island in the Sea of Marmora near the mouth of the Black Sea, well situated for hearing travellers' tales of regions far north of the Black Sea. Aristeas narrates in the course of his poem that he was \"wrapt in Bacchic fury\" when he travelled to the north and saw the Arimaspians, as reported by Herodotus:\n\nThis Aristeas, possessed by Phoibos, visited the Issedones; beyond these (he said) live the one-eyed Arimaspoi, beyond whom are the Grypes that guard gold, and beyond these again the Hyperboreoi, whose territory reaches to the sea. Except for the Hyperboreoi, all these nations (and first the Arimaspoi) are always at war with their neighbors.\n\nArimaspi and griffins remained stock images associated with the outlands of the north: the Aeschylan \"Prometheus Bound\" (ca 415 BC?), describing the wanderings of Io, notes that she is not to pass through the north, among the Arimaspi and griffins, but southward. Herodotus, \"Father of History\", admits the fantastic allure of the edges of the known world: \"The most outlying lands, though, as they enclose and wholly surround all the rest of the world, are likely to have those things which we think the finest and the rarest.\" (\"Histories\" iii.116.1) Ignoring the scepticism of Herodotus, Strabo and Pliny's \"Natural History\" perpetuated the fables about the northern people who had a single eye in the center of their foreheads and engaged in stealing gold from the griffins, causing disagreements between the two groups.\n\nModern historians speculate on historical identities that may be selectively extracted from the brief account of \"Arimaspi\". Herodotus recorded a detail recalled from \"Arimaspea\" that may have a core in fact: \"the Issedones were pushed from their lands by the Arimaspoi, and the Scythians by the Issedones\" (iv.13.1). The \"sp\" in the name suggests that it was mediated through Iranian sources to Greek, indeed in Early Iranian \"Arimaspi\" combines \"Ariama\" (love) and \"Aspa\" (horses). Herodotus or his source seems to have understood the Scythian word as a combination of the roots \"arima\" (\"one\") and \"spou\" (\"eye\") and to have created a mythic image to account for it. Similarity of name and location, could identify them with the ancestors of the local Uralic people, the Mari.\n\nIt has been suggested that the griffins were inferred from the fossilized bones of \"Protoceratops\".\n\nThe brief report of Herodotus seems to be very flimsy ground for making unequivocal statements about the historical background out of which the legend emerged. Notwithstanding these reservations, Tadeusz Sulimirski (1970) claims that the Arimaspi were a Sarmatian tribe originating in the upper valley of the River Irtysh, while Dmitry Machinsky (1997) associates them with a group of three-eyed \"ajna\" figurines from the Minusinsk Depression, traditionally attributed to the Afanasevo and Okunevo cultures of southern Siberia.\n\nAs philologists have noted, the struggle between the Arimaspi and the griffins has remarkable similarities to Homer's account of the Pygmaioi warring with cranes. Michael Rostovtzeff found a rendering of the subject in the Vault of Pygmies near Kerch, a territory that used to have a significant Scythian population. Analogous representations have been discovered as far apart as the Volci of Etruria and the fifth kurgan of Pazyryk. A Hellenistic literary rendering of a battle with uncanny guardian \"birds of Ares\" is in \"Argonautica\" 1.\n\nCheremisin and Zaporozhchenko (1999), following the methodology of Georges Dumézil, attempt to trace parallels in Germanic mythology (Odin and the mead of poetry, the eagle stealing golden apples of eternal youth). They hypothesize that all these stories, Germanic, Scythian, and Greek, reflect a Proto-Indo-European belief about the monsters guarding the entrance to the otherworld, who engage in battles with the birds conveying the souls of the newly dead to the otherworld and returning with a variety of precious gifts symbolizing new life.\n\n\n\n"}

Born in Sherburn-in-Elmet, he has played in the Football League for Leeds United, Ipswich Town, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers, Hull City, Plymouth Argyle, Blackpool, Crewe Alexandra, Stevenage, and Crawley Town. Walton was capped by England at under-16, under-17 and under-19 level.\n\nWalton started his career at hometown club Leeds United. He came to attention after being sent off in a pre-season friendly against Valencia in 2004, whilst still just sixteen. He was likened to former Elland Road heroes Alan Smith and David Batty. He made his competitive debut on 7 August 2004 against Derby County, and went on to score three goals in the 2004–05 season, Leeds' first in the Championship. Walton struggled to break into the first team during the 2005–06 season with his only appearances coming after injuries to Sean Gregan, Shaun Derry, Jonathan Douglas and Gylfi Einarsson.\n\nIn July 2006 he joined Premier League side Charlton Athletic for an initial fee of £500,000, with clauses that could create a total £1m fee. He quickly moved on loan to get some regular first-team football, moving to Ipswich Town three games into the Championship season on 18 August 2006. Walton scored several important goals for Ipswich before being loaned to another Championship side, Cardiff City, in January 2007. When playing for Cardiff, he was sent off against former club Leeds for two bookable offences.\n\nWalton joined Championship side Queens Park Rangers on 27 July 2007 in a £200,000 deal, having never played a competitive game for Charlton. Shortly afterwards, he broke his leg in a friendly against Fulham.\n\nOn 29 January 2008 Walton moved to Championship play-off hopefuls Hull City on loan for the remainder of the 2007–08 season.\n\nOn 6 August 2008, Walton signed for Plymouth Argyle on a four-year contract. Originally proclaimed as a club record signing at £750,000, the initial fee paid was well below the £500,000 paid to Cardiff City for Steve MacLean and never surpassed it prior to the club being placed in administration in March 2011. Walton made his debut for Plymouth in a 2–2 draw with Wolves on 9 August.\n\nOn 22 December 2008 Walton was placed on the transfer list by Paul Sturrock after being sent off in a league match against Barnsley. Sturrock questioned Walton's attitude and temperament after some abject performances, and rash decisions by the player. On 26 March 2009 he joined Blackpool on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut on 11 April as a 74th-minute substitute in Blackpool's 1–0 West Lancashire Derby win over Preston North End at Deepdale.\n\nOn 31 August 2009 he joined Crewe Alexandra on loan for the 2009–10 season.\n\nWalton joined Sheffield United on a season-long loan in July 2010. However, he suffered cruciate knee ligament damage during his first outing for the club in a pre-season friendly which proved to be a long-term injury. Following a recovery period at Bramall Lane his parent club, Plymouth Argyle, agreed to terminate his loan and recall him at the start of September.\nOn 5 April 2011, Walton made his first appearance for nine months, and his first for Argyle since 2008, against Leyton Orient. Walton scored his first goal in the match against MK Dons on 25 April 2011.\nAfter the club appointed Carl Fletcher as caretaker manager the captaincy was handed to Walton who has become one of the senior players in the young squad. Walton has subsequently scored several goals, some as penalties, including a brace against Burton Albion on 14 January 2012.\n\nWalton had his contract extended until the end of the 2012–13 season in April 2012. Manager Carl Fletcher revealed that Walton had agreed a new deal the previous autumn when the club was in the process of being bought by businessman James Brent. \"He signed a new deal during the takeover to benefit the club,\" said Fletcher in an interview with BBC Radio Devon. \"He agreed terms on a deal when the club was being taken over to help and aid the club in getting it out of administration.\"\n\nWalton was released by Plymouth in July 2012 so he could be closer to his daughter, and signed for Hartlepool United on 6 July.\n\nWalton signed for Stevenage on 30 June 2014 on a free transfer.\n\nWalton signed for Crawley Town on 18 June 2015 on a free transfer on a two-year deal.\n\nOn 12 October 2018, Walton joined Maidstone United permanently after a short-term loan. At the end of December 2018, Tristan Lewis was appointed caretaker manager, with Walton as his assistant.\n\nOn 11 May 2019, Havant & Waterlooville announced that Walton had joined the club as a player / coach.\n\nWalton began dating Nicola Tappenden, a glamour model, in 2007 and they went on to be engaged. He became a father in November 2008 when Tappenden gave birth to a baby girl named Poppy.

Her dance teacher was Frances Allis who taught movement for actors as well as her own modern dance technique which has many similarities to Graham's. Lang studied Allis technique and performed with her company in Chicago. In 1938, at the age of 17, she enrolled in a program for gifted students at the University of Chicago, where she remained until 1941, the year of her move to New York. Born Pearl Lack, she adopted the stage name, \"Pearl Lang\", she studied with Martha Graham and Louis Horst and joined the Martha Graham Dance Company where she remained as a soloist from 1942 to 1952, and as a guest artist from 1954 through the late 1970s. She was the first woman to dance Martha Graham's roles in seven dances of Graham repertoire which she performed intermittently for thirty years to critical and audience acclaim. She was an original cast member in \"Deaths and Entrances\", \"Punch and the Judy\", \"Land Be Bright\", \"Imagined Wing\", \"Diversion of Angels\", \"Canticle for Innocent Comedians\", \"Ardent Song\", \"Dark Meadow\", \"Night Journey\", \"Eye of Anguish\", and \"Appalachian Spring\". She was also a featured dancer in Broadway productions of \"Carousel\" (1945–47), \"Finian's Rainbow\", and \"Peer Gynt\".\n\nIn 1952, she founded her own company, Pearl Lang Dance Theater, for which she choreographed sixty-three works, thirty-six of which were based on Jewish themes. She choreographed for film, opera, and television and her works have been performed by the Dutch National Ballet, Boston Ballet, and the Batsheva Dance Company of Israel. In 1970, she invited Alvin Ailey and his company to share a three-story building with her dance company at 229 East 59th Street in Manhattan where, together, they co-directed the American Dance Center as a joint school. Pearl Lang Dance Theater's last New York season was held at the Danny Kaye Playhouse in 2001.\n\nAmong the many citations and awards that Lang received are two Guggenheim Fellowships for Choreography; the Martha Graham Award for Performance and Choreography; The Workmen's Circle Award for her contribution to Jewish Culture through Dance; the Achievement Award from the Artists and Writers for Peace in the Middle East; the Achievement Award from the Congress for Jewish Culture; the Cultural Achievement Award from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture; Queens College Award for Excellence in Jewish Art, and from the Juilliard School, an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts on May 19, 1995. In 1997, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the International Committee for The Dance Library of Israel. In 2001 at the American Dance Festival she received the award for \"Lifetime Distinguished Teaching\".\n\nAs a teacher, Lang reached generations of young dancers. She served on the faculties of Yale University from 1954 to 1968, Juilliard School of Music from 1952 to 1969, Connecticut College and Neighborhood Playhouse from 1963 to 1968, and the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance up until shortly before her death. Among her many students were singer Madonna and choreographer Pina Bausch.\n\nLang was recuperating from hip surgery when she died of a heart attack in Manhattan, three months before her 88th birthday. She lived on the Upper West Side with her husband, actor Joseph Wiseman, to whom she had been married since 1964. Wiseman himself died less than eight months later, on October 19.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the largest advocacy, education, and political organization working in Oregon to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Basic Rights Oregon has a full-time staff, a contract lobbyist, and more than 10,000 contributors, and 5,000 volunteers. It is a 501(c)(4) organization that maintains a 501(c)(3) education fund, a state candidate PAC and a ballot measure PAC. The organization is a member of the Equality Federation.\n\nOregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), an organization that opposed LGBT rights, successfully backed the passage of a 1988 ballot measure revoking the ban on sexual-orientation discrimination in the state's executive branch. In 1992, when OCA proposed a ballot measure to prohibit the \"encouragement\" of homosexual lifestyles in public schools, Oregonians who supported LGBT rights raised over $2 million and were successful in defeating the measure. OCA continued to promote similar measures at the local level and promised another statewide ballot in 1994. In response activists pressured for a stable political organization and formed Support Our Communities-PAC (SOC-PAC) in 1993. The following year, SOC-PAC successfully organized the opposition to another OCA proposal, a ballot measure to ban the recognition of homosexuals as a minority group. Oregon Ballot Measure 9, in the year 2000, would have prevented any positive or neutral language from being used by educators or administrators in all Oregon public schools from Kindergarten through Ph.D. (https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Prohibition_of_Public_School_Instruction_on_Homosexual_Behaviors,_Measure_9_(2000).\n\nBasic Rights Oregon held its first meetings in 1995 and became a 501(c)(4) organization in 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Basic Rights launched the Fair Workplace Project, which was designed to increase the number of employers voluntarily adopting nondiscrimination policies.\n\nIn 2002, Basic Rights Oregon endorsed Democratic candidate Bill Bradbury for election to the United States Senate, opposing the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT rights organization, which endorsed the re-election of the Republican incumbent Gordon H. Smith.\n\nIn 2004, Basic Rights Oregon, nine same-sex couples, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Multnomah County joined as plaintiffs against the State of Oregon, the Governor, the Attorney General, the Director of the Department of Human Services, and the State Registrar in a suit, \"Li v. State\", in the Oregon Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the statutes (ORS chapter 106) prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying on the same terms as different-sex couples violated the Oregon Constitution.\n\nIn 2004, Basic Rights Oregon worked against Ballot Measure 36, which amended the Oregon Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. Although Basic Rights Oregon raised nearly $3 million to fight the measure, it passed with 57% in favor and 43% opposed. Following this loss, Basic Rights Oregon hired its first team of field organizers and pushed nondiscrimination ordinances in Washington County, Bend, Hillsboro, and Wasco County.\n\nIn 2007, Basic Rights led the lobbying effort to pass the Oregon Equality Act and the Oregon Family Fairness Act.\n\nIn 2012, following years of education and collaboration with Basic Rights Oregon, the state Insurance Division issued a bulletin banning many private insurers from selling discriminatory policies in Oregon.\n\nIn 2015, in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on Marriage Equality, Basic Rights Oregon adopted a new strategic direction for 2015-2020. The new strategic direction seeks to center the voices of LGBTQ people of color, of rural and religious LGBTQ Oregonians, and of transgender and gender non-conforming Oregonians.\n\nIn 2015, Oregon became the third state to ban the discredited practice of Conversion therapy on minors. Basic Rights Oregon worked to pass HB2307, the Youth Mental Health Protection Act, which was signed into law by Gov. Kate Brown, the nations only out Bi-sexual governor.\n\nIn 2017 Oregon passed HB 2673A - effective January 1, 2018 - simplifying the process for changing the name on a birth certificate, and also establishing a gender amendment process for transgender citizens. The revisions provide less expensive, more private and simpler transactions. The Department of Motor Vehicles also changed its procedure for gender changes on IDs, allowing Oregonians to self-certify gender change without input from their health provider. Furthermore, effective July 1, 2017, the DMV made Oregon the first state in the country to recognize non-binary identities. The third marker on IDs is \"X\", for \"not specified.\"\n\nAs of January 1, 2018, contractors working with the state of Oregon must have in place policies and practices which prohibit discrimination against their LGBTQ employees. The sponsor of the successful bill, HB 3060, was Rep. Ann Lininger. The measure also prevents state contractors from health care discrimination based on gender identity.\n\n\n"}

He died in Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies, likely executed.\n\nYu was born in Fuyang, Zhejiang province. His father died when he was three, leaving the family poverty-stricken and destitute. He received a number of scholarships through the Chinese government and went on to receive a traditional Chinese education in Hangzhou. Chronologically he studied in Jiangxing Middle School (before he came to Hangzhou), Hangzhou Middle School, Yuying Academy (育英学堂, formerly of Zhejiang University).\n\nIn 1912, he entered Hangchow University (later its major part merged into Zhejiang University) preparatory through examination. He was there only for a short period before he was expelled for participation in a student strike.\n\nHe then moved to Japan, where he studied economics at the Tokyo Imperial University between 1913 and 1922, where he met other Chinese intellectuals (namely, Guo Moruo, Zhang Ziping and Tian Han). Together, in 1921 they founded the \"Chuangzao she\" 創造社 (\"Creation Society\"), which promoted vernacular and modern literature. He published one of his earlier works, the short story \"Chenlun\"\" (沉淪, Sinking), his most famous, while still in Japan in 1921. The work had gained immense popularity in China, shocking the world of Chinese literature with its frank dealing with sex, as well as grievances directed at the incompetence of Chinese government at the time.\n\nIn 1922, he returned to China as a literary celebrity and worked as the editor of \"Creation Quarterly\", editing journals and writing short stories. In 1923, after an attack of tuberculosis, Yu Dafu directed his attention to the welfare of the masses.\n\nIn 1927, he worked as an editor of the \"Hongshui\" literary magazine. He later came in conflict with the Communist Party of China and fled back to Japan.\n\nAfter the start of the Second Sino-Japanese war, he returned to China and worked as a writer of anti-Japanese propaganda in Hangzhou. From 1938 to 1942, he worked as a literary editor for the newspaper \"Sin Chew Jit Poh\" in Singapore.\n\nIn 1942 when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Singapore, he was forced to flee to Pajakoemboeh, Sumatra. Known under a different identity, he settled there among other overseas Chinese and began a brewery business with the help of the locals. Later he was forced to help the Japanese military police as an interpreter when it was discovered that he was one of the few \"locals\" in the area who could speak Japanese.\n\nIn 1945, he was arrested by the Kempeitai when his true identity was finally discovered. It is believed that he was executed by the Japanese shortly after the surrender of Japan.\n\n\nYu Dafu's work is considered by leading scholars to be iconoclastic and controversial. His heroes, which supposedly reflect the author are \"By turns voyeur, fetishist, homosexual, masochist, and kleptomaniac.\" The sexually repressed heroes cannot relate to women. The alleged 'decadence' of Yu Dafu's novels, whether in a pejorative or in an aesthetic sense (i.e.'Decadence' as an artistic movement) has been considered by some Chinese Marxist critics to be a sign of Yu Dafu's moral corruption, but Shih argues that Yu Dafu's writings constitute a serious-minded critique of China's political plight and perceived social conformism. Indeed, concern for the person and for the nation are intimately linked in his work, and the effeminate and ailing body serves as a metaphor for the weak and sickly nation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Concert Hall. Rzewski dedicated the composition to Oppens, who had commissioned it, and who recorded it in 1979; her recording was named \"Record of the Year\" in that year by Record World, and received a Grammy nomination.\n\nThe song on which the variations is based is one of many that emerged from the Unidad Popular coalition in Chile between 1969 and 1973, prior to the overthrow of the Salvador Allende government. Rzewski composed the variations in September and October 1975, as a tribute to the struggle of the Chilean people against the newly imposed repressive regime of Augusto Pinochet; indeed the work contains allusions to other leftist struggles of the same and immediately preceding time, such as quotations from the Italian traditional socialist song \"Bandiera Rossa\" and the Bertolt Brecht-Hanns Eisler \"Solidarity Song.\"\n\nIn general, the variations are short, and build up to climaxes of considerable force. The 36 variations, following the 36 bars of the tune, are in six groups of six. The pianist, in addition to needing a virtuoso technique, is required to whistle, slam the piano lid, and catch the after-vibrations of a loud attack as harmonics: all of these are \"extended\" techniques in 20th-century piano writing. Much of the work uses the language of 19th-century romanticism, but mixes this language with pandiatonic tonality, modal writing, and even serial techniques.\n\nAs in the \"Goldberg Variations\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, the final variation is a direct restatement of the original theme, intended to be heard with new significance after the long journey through the variations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Regarded as a preeminent and very proficient left winger, Džajić has been known for his \"great crosses and passes, unstoppable dribbling with great pace, natural technique and some of the best left footed free kicks ever seen\". Džajić is viewed by some football experts as perhaps one of the most underrated players in European football, partly because he played in Yugoslavia. In December 2011, Džajić was named in being part of \"the greatest European Championship XI of all time\" by Goal.com.\n\nBorn on 30 May 1946, in the small town of Ub, 60 kilometres outside Belgrade, Džajić's football career (1961–1978) was spent primarily with Red Star Belgrade. Džajić was a brilliant left winger who guided a Red Star Belgrade career spanning 590 games and 287 goals by winning five league titles and four Yugoslavian Cups. In 1969, Džajić received the \"Sport\" newspaper's Golden Badge award for Yugoslavia's best athlete. He is considered to have been one of the most important players in the history of the club and is one of only five players to have been awarded the \"Zvezdine Zvezde\" status.\n\nIn 2013, Džajić was identified as the greatest Yugoslavian player of all time, and honoured by his inclusion alongside Pele in the best Sheep Draft team of the year.\n\nDžajić was plucked from the relative obscurity of his local club, FK Jedinstvo, by Red Star Belgrade youth coach Miljan Miljanić, spending two years in the club's youth system.\n\nThough only 17 years and 8 days of age, Džajić was handed his first team debut by head coach Miša Pavić in a Yugoslav First League match against FK Budućnost Titograd on 8 June 1963, which finished 0–0. It was the last week of the 1962–63 league season with FK Partizan already clinching the league championship and Red Star hovering in 7th place, out of European spots. The match was played at Omladinski Stadium at Karaburma because Red Star's famous home Marakana was in the final construction stages.\n\nDžajić might have started out as a left-back, but it was further up the flank that he made his impact. Red Star Belgrade's resident # 11 was an expert dribbler whose sweet left foot provided countless goals for teammate Vojin Lazarević, his right wasn't bad either. Džajić was rewarded for his brilliance with championship medals in 1964, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1973, while he lifted the cup in 1964, 1968, 1970 and 1971.\n\nEuropean Champion Clubs' Cup success very nearly came his way too. In the 1970–71 season, Red Star Belgrade reached the semi-finals of the top continental club competition, and beat Panathinaikos FC 4–1 in the first leg in Belgrade. Džajić was suspended for the return in Athens, however, which the Greek team won 3–0 to go through on away goals.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1977, he played for SC Bastia in France (scoring another 31 times). He is considered to have been one of their most notable players of all time.\n\nDžajić said about his most well-known international matches (at the UEFA Euro 1968):\n\nDžajić was just 18 when he was first named to the Yugoslav national team. He made his debut on 17 June 1964 in a 2–1 defeat against Romania at the JNA Stadium in Belgrade. Džajić would go on to earn 85 caps (the most in the history of the Yugoslav national team) and score 23 goals. He became renowned for his passing, dribbling and goal-scoring. His most famous international match was likely the 1968 European Championship semifinal against England, in which his 87th-minute lob over the goalkeeper Gordon Banks gave Yugoslavia a 1–0 victory against the defending world champions. The British press dubbed him \"the magic Dragan.\" He went on to score in the final against Italy but he could not prevent Yugoslavia losing 2–0 after a replay.\n\nHe participated in the 1974 FIFA World Cup which was held in West Germany. Džajić participated in Yugoslavia's opening championship game draw with world champions Brazil and scored one goal in a record victory of 9–0 against Zaire. However, after passing the second stage of the championship, Yugoslavia didn't repeat the results of their opening games. They lost three games in a row, and had to return home.\n\nDžajić retired as a player in 1978, at the age of 32. Right away, he began performing a role as Red Star's technical director. In his first season in the new administrative role, the club reached the UEFA Cup final. Džajić became the main decision-maker within the club when it comes to transfer policy.\n\nIn 1998, Džajić became the club's president – a position he resigned from in 2004 due to health issues.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the trial started in which Džajić was charged of fraud perpetrated during the sale of players from Red Star Belgrade during Džajić's time as the president of the club, specifically Nemanja Vidić. Džajić pleaded not guilty. The charges against Nemanja Vidić were dropped. Nemanja Vidić also denied all accusations against Dragan Džajić. Many of the people believe that football \"agents\" wanted Džajić \"out of business\" because he had too much influence in Balkan's football market. On 16 November 2012, Tomislav Nikolić, the President of Serbia, signed an exempt from criminal liability of all charges. This abolition ended all proceedings against Džajić.\n\nIt was stated by local Serbian newspapers in the beginning of December 2011 that Džajić would return to the administration of Red Star, as it was believed that Džajić was the only one who could get Red Star back on track. However, nothing came of this. Džajić spoke to Blic (tabloid daily newspaper in Serbia) after the board meeting, saying: \"I spoke with people from the club, the desire to return was not disputed, I wanted to help, because everything that I previously experienced with the club cannot be forgotten. I followed, listened to and read what happened at the meeting, I wanted to come back but nothing happened and life goes on. I remain available and in this case I can only wish Red Star better days.\"\n\nOn 19 December 2012, Džajić was elected as Red Star President for the third time.\n\nRed Star Belgrade \n\nYugoslavia \n\nAwards\n\nIn November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Serbia and Montenegro by the Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.\n\nAhead of the last draw for the finals of Euro 2012, Goal.com looked back at all the past tournaments since the first edition in 1960 to select a best-ever XI. The greatest European Championship XI of all time featuring Zidane, Van Basten and Maldini also featured Dragan Džajić. The players were chosen based on their performances for their countries in the European Championship only. Author of the text said: \"Regarded by some as Europe's greatest ever left winger, Džajić was Euro '68's best player. He scored the semi-final winner versus England with a delightful lob before opening the scoring in the final against Italy. Yugoslavia were set to triumph until a late equaliser from Angelo Domenghini forced a replay that Italy won 2–0. In 1976, he was again up to mischief as he ran West Germany ragged in the semis, scoring to put Yugoslavia 2–0 up. Germany forced extra-time with a late comeback and eventually won 4–2. Džajić was a master dribbler with a vicious left foot.\"\n\nIn 2016, UEFA organized a voting to select EURO-s 11 Best players of all times, from a list of 50. Džajić was a candidate, the voting took place in May 2016. This time around, Džajić was not part of the team.\n\n"}

In the official Court Circular they are styled 'Lord in Waiting' or 'Baroness in Waiting' (i.e. without hyphenation).\n\nThere are two kinds of Lord in Waiting: political appointees by the government of the day who serve as junior government whips in the House of Lords (the senior whips have the positions of Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard); and non-political appointments by the monarch (who, if they have a seat in the House of Lords, sit as crossbenchers). Baronesses and Lords in Waiting (whether political or non-political) may be called upon periodically to represent the Sovereign; for example, one of their number is regularly called upon to greet visiting Heads of State on arrival at an airport at the start of a State or official visit, and they may then play a role in accompanying them for the duration of their stay. (For instance, on 3 June 2019 the Lord in Waiting Viscount Brookeborough was in attendance at Stansted Airport to welcome the President of the United States and Mrs Trump on behalf of the Queen; he and Viscountess Brookeborough then remained 'specially attached' to the President and Mrs Trump for the duration of their visit.) They are also occasionally in attendance on other State or royal occasions. 'Extra' Lords in Waiting may also be appointed, supernumerary to the regular appointees, who fulfil a similar role; for example, the Baroness Rawlings, whose appointment as a government whip (and Baroness in Waiting) ceased in 2012, has since then served as an Extra Baroness in Waiting, and has continued to represent The Queen on certain occasions (for example on 27 February 2019 she was present at RAF Northolt to welcome the King and Queen of Jordan, while at the same time another Baroness in Waiting, Baroness Manzoor, was present at Heathrow Airport to welcome the President of the Republic of Slovenia).\n\nIn addition, the honour of serving as a Permanent Lord in Waiting is occasionally bestowed on very senior courtiers following their retirement. A Permanent Lord in Waiting may also represent the Sovereign, as often happens at funerals or memorial services for former courtiers.\n\nMost Baronesses and Lords in Waiting serve as government whips in the House of Lords. Being members of the government, they are appointed by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and invariably relinquish their position when there is a change of government. \n\nCurrently, there are six Lords and Baronesses in Waiting who serve as junior whips in the House of Lords:\n\nAlongside the political appointees two non-political Lords in Waiting are always appointed, at the personal discretion of the sovereign (distinguished from their political counterparts by the designation 'Personal Lord in Waiting'). \n\nThose currently serving in this capacity are:\n\nAny additional appointees are termed Extra Lords (or Baronesses) in Waiting.\n\nThose currently serving in this capacity are:\n\nPermanent Lords in Waiting are retired senior officials of the Royal Household.

He entered the Gevorkian Theological Seminary at Echmiadzin in 1965 and graduated with honors in 1971. He was ordained to the diaconate in 1970. Later he became a monk and was ordained a priest in 1972. In the late 1970s the Catholicos of that period encouraged him to study outside of Armenia. This led to him continuing his studies in Vienna, Bonn University, and Zagorsk, Russia. On October 23, 1983, he was consecrated bishop at Echmiadzin. He became an archbishop in 1992.\n\nKarekin II speaks fluent German from his time in Germany and Austria. In 1975 during his time in Cologne he was the spiritual representative of nine Armenian congregations in Germany.\n\nIn 1988 Karekin took an active role in helping his people overcome the Armenian earthquake. He oversaw the construction of a number of churches and schools in Armenia. He also showed an interest in using modern technology and telecommunications to help the life of his churches as well as dealing with the legacies of the Soviet era.\nOn 27 October 1999 he was elected the 132nd Catholicos of All Armenians at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, succeeding Karekin I. His relations with Pope John Paul II were generally positive. When the Pope visited Armenia in 2001, he stayed with the Catholicos.\n\nIn 2006 Karekin made a week-long visit to Istanbul, Turkey, to meet with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and to visit the city's Armenian community. During his visit he caused controversy by speaking out about the Armenian Genocide, which Turkey vehemently denies, and insisting on its recognition by Turkey.\n\nIn October 2007, he began a second visit to the United States. On October 10, 2007, he offered the opening prayer for the day's session of the United States House of Representatives.\n\nHis ecumenical trip to India to meet Baselios Thoma Didymos I, Catholicos of the East in November 2008, helped strengthen relations between the Armenian and Indian Orthodox Churches.\nThe delegates to the 10th General Assembly of the World Council of Churches that took place in Busan, South Korea, on November 4, unanimously elected Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II, the supreme patriarch and head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, head of the organization for the next eight years.\n\nOn 26 June 2016, Catholicos Karekin and Pope Francis signed a joint declaration on the family. It stated that the secularization of society and its \"alienation from the spiritual and divine\" are damaging to the family, and affirmed that the Catholic and Armenian Apostolic churches share a marriage–based view of the family. The declaration also took note of various positive steps taken towards unity between the two leaders' churches, and \"acknowledged the successful 'new phase' in relations\" between them. It also lamented \"immense tragedy\" of the widespread persecution of Christians in the Middle East; the Pope and the Catholicos prayed \"for a change of heart in all those who commit such crimes and those who are in a position to stop the violence\".\n\n\n"}

In 1883, Henry was transferred to command Fort Saskatchewan; the family travelled on the Canadian Pacific Railway to Calgary and then by wagon train to Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan, on occasion having to build or repair bridges in order to cross rivers.\n\nWilliam Griesbach left the rest of the family in 1891 in order to attend St. John's College in Winnipeg, from which he graduated in 1895. Upon graduating, he returned to Edmonton and worked in a law firm for two years and in the Imperial Bank for one year, before returning to Fort Saskatchewan to work in a milling business for six months. He returned to Edmonton to study law.\n\nGriesbach enlisted with the Canadian Mounted Rifles in 1899 to fight in the Second Boer War. He knew from being weighed in at boxing tournaments that he fell short of the minimum weight to enlist, so on his way to being weighed he surreptitiously grabbed a large piece of coal from the enlistment centre's coal box and held it behind his back while he stood on the scales. During his service, he was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal and received four bars.\nUpon his return in 1901, he opened a law office of his own. An Edmonton Bulletin article in 1927 quoted him as saying of these early years\n\nGriesbach's first bid for political office took place in the 1903 Edmonton election, when he made an unsuccessful bid for election to Edmonton Town Council, placing fourth of nine candidates in an election in which the top three were elected. He was more successful in the 1904 election when he was elected to a one-year term as an alderman to Edmonton's first city council placing eighth of seventeen candidates (in that first election as a city, Edmonton elected four aldermen to two year terms and four to one year terms, with the idea that four of the city's eight aldermen would be elected to two year terms each year). He was re-elected to a two-year term in 1905, finishing first of ten candidates.\n\nThat same year, he ran as a Conservative in the riding of Edmonton in Alberta's first provincial election. He was defeated by Liberal Charles Cross, and continued his service on city council.\n\nGriesbach resigned as alderman one year into his term in order to run for mayor in the 1906 election. He was victorious, collecting more than sixty percent of the vote in a three-person race and becoming, at twenty-eight years old, the youngest mayor in the city's history, before or since. He served a one-year term, but did not seek re-election and stayed out of municipal politics thereafter.\n\nHe ran as a Conservative in the 1911 federal election, finishing second of three candidates in the riding of Edmonton (the victorious candidate was Liberal Frank Oliver).\n\nGriesbach's final involvement in provincial politics would come during the 1913 election, when he ran as a Conservative in Edmonton. He finished fourth of five candidates.\n\nIn 1906, Griesbach was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 19th Alberta Dragoons. He was promoted to captain in 1907\n\nWhen World War I broke out, the Dragoons volunteered as a unit. In December of that year, Griesbach was promoted to major assigned to command the 49th Battalion. He was able to recruit 1000 men in eight days in January 1915. The unit served in various engagements, including the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Battle of Arras, the Third Battle of Ypres, and the liberation of Mons. In 1917, Griesbach was promoted to Brigadier-General and assigned command of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division.\n\nHe was awarded the Distinguished Service Order twice and the Victorian Decoration for long service. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath and Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.\n\nDuring World War II, he was made Inspector General of the Canadian Army for Western Canada, and was promoted to the rank of Major-General. He retired from that position in 1943.\n\nWilliam Griesbach was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Government member for the riding of Edmonton West in the 1917 election, defeating incumbent Laurier Liberal Frank Oliver. He served until 15 September 1921 (less than three months before the 1921 election), when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada, in which he served until his death.\n\nGriesbach was an accomplished cyclist and played ice hockey and soccer for Edmonton teams. He was a member of the Masonic Order, the Oddfellows, the Edmonton Veteran Association, the Canadian Club, and the Northern Alberta Pioneer and Old Timers' Association.\n\nIn 1906, he married Janet Scott McDonald Lauder.\n\nWilliam Antrobus Griesbach died in Edmonton on January 21, 1945, of a sudden heart attack.\n\nCFB Griesbach, the Griesbach Garrison (part of CFB Edmonton), Griesbach Masonic Lodge, and Edmonton's Griesbach neighbourhood are named in his honour.

Trade on this route and during the period of the Hanseatic League came from as far as London. The city is located at the eastern extremity of the Ruhr district, about east of the centre of Dortmund.\n\nUnna consists of the following districts:\n\nMassen and Königsborn are former industrial and mining areas; the other districts have a more rural character.\n\nThe history of human settlement in what is now the city of Unna can be traced back to the Neolithic Era.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Unna gained significance as a way station on the Hellweg. It is first recorded by name in an ecclesiastical document of 1032. Around 1200, Count Friedrich von Altena-Isenberg was invested with the fiefdom of Unna, among other estates, by the archbishop-electorate of Cologne. Over the next few hundred years the town was repeatedly fought over, and burned down several times. In the 14th century the town became wealthy: a mint was established and regional trade blossomed. This is documented by the discovery of around 70 gold coins during excavation works in 1952. The coins originated from various countries and are thought to have been buried around 1375.\n\nFrom the mid-15th century on, the town was a notable trade centre and member of the Hanseatic League. In 1597 more than half the population died of the Bubonic plague. In the early 17th century, the town changed hands several times in religious wars, and in 1666 fell under the control of Prussia. In the early 19th century, the primary character of the town started to change from agricultural to industrial, with improved communications by road, rail and waterways. Coal mining started in 1870, together with industries dependent on it. The population rose from around 2,500 at the start of the 19th century to 15,000 in 1900.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the city district Königsborn (then \"Bad Königsborn\") gained prominence as a health resort with mineral springs. The cityscape of Königsborn still shows many historic buildings from that era, and the former spa gardens still serve as a recreation place for locals and tourists. In 2013, a geological survey showed that the mineral springs could still be used for health purposes.\n\nDuring the Second World War, in 1943-45 there were major air attacks directed at the significant barracks and other military installations in the city.\n\nIn the older part of the city, there are many half-timbered buildings built between the 16th and 19th centuries. Unna's economy was largely based on agriculture until the 19th century, when it became industrialised. After World War II, the artisan district which had survived bombing was largely torn down to make way for modern development; however many of the buildings have been restored.\n\nUnna is seat of the world's only art museum dedicated exclusively to the collection and presentation of Light art, the Centre for International Light Art (CILA). It is located in the former Linden brewery, a red brick industrial building complex dating from the 19th century close to the heart of the city. Its landmark is an installation of Fibonacci numbers by Italian artist Mario Merz on the brewery's chimney. The light art installations are integrated into the industrial structures of the brewery's former cellar vaults. The former brewery buildings are also home to the town library, the adult education centre (Volkshochschule), and the tourist information centre.\n\nThe city's \"Hellweg Museum\", a regional history museum, is located in the medieval Unna castle. Many historic buildings as well as parts of the town wall, including towers near the artisan quarter, remain intact and in good condition.\n\nUnna holds the largest Italian festival north of Italy every two years, when buildings are decorated with light installations by artists from Bari in Italy. An annual Christmas market and a city festival are located in the Old Market Square, stretching from there through the pedestrian area to the city hall.\n\nUnna is home to a large community of artists, some of whose works are on public display in the city. In the Old Market Square, e.g., there is a statue by painter and sculptor Josef Baron, depicting a man pulling a stubborn donkey, which is the town mascot.\n\nA common part of traditional German drinking culture, numerous breweries once formed part of the cityscape, of which the largest and most well known was the \"Lindenbrauerei\" (formerly \"Linden-Adler-Brauerei\"). It marketed its products under the name \"Lindenbier\" or \"Lindenpils\". Most of the breweries have since closed down, but the Lindenbrauerei started a small-scale production again at the beginning of the 21st century. In common with other German towns, Unna also produces its own traditional herbal liquor, 'Herting Pörter', named after the town's Herting gate or 'port'. The liquor is produced near where the gate used to be, and is sold locally.\n\nThe newly refurbished Unna station has trains to all major cities in North Rhine Westphalia including Dortmund, Cologne, Münster, Hamm, Düsseldorf and Wuppertal. There is also the Regional-Express 7 (Rhein-Münsterland-Express) which runs from Rheine via Cologne to Krefeld.\n\nThe recreational district of Sauerland is nearby. The River Ruhr runs just south of Unna through Fröndenberg, before heading through the main part of the Ruhr district.\n\nLocal dialects of German include Westfälisch and Ruhrpott.\n\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century the focus of Unna's economy was on the region's agriculture. Industrialisation rapidly followed. In contrast with the switch to service sector employment in some of the industrial towns further west in the Ruhr area, most of the jobs in Unna are still in heavy industry (iron and metal work, machine manufacturing) or craft based.\n\nIn recent years Unna has boomed as a logistics centre. It houses the former for the (recently much diminished) Karstadt department store chain; the distribution centre has been acquired by the DHL division of Deutsche Post. There is also a DPD distribution centre along with a central distribution depot for the pump producer Wilo. Another large logistics complex belonging to DHL came into operation in 2008.\n\nUnna also serves as a dormitory town, being home to many commuters who work in Dortmund and other nearby cities.\n\nUnna is twinned with:\n\n"}

He was particularly good at performing the Tale of the Heike, an epic describing the fall of Emperor Antoku, who is buried at Amidaji Temple. His performances were so wonderful that \"even the goblins could not refrain from tears\". Despite his talents, Hoichi was very poor and was forced to live at Amidaji Temple with a friendly priest.\n\nAs the story goes, Hoichi was approached late one night by a gruff samurai who demanded that the minstrel play for his lord. The retainer led the blind Hoichi into what appeared to be the home of some powerful nobleman, where a performance of the Tale of the Heike was requested. Hoichi's performance was met by high praise and moved his audience to tears, and he was asked to return the next evening for a follow-up recital. Before the retainer returned him to his temple, Hoichi was told that the nobleman for whom he had been playing was traveling incognito, and was warned not to speak of the evening's events.\n\nThe following evening, the samurai returned to Hoichi's quarters and led him back to the nobleman. However, this time Hoichi's absence was discovered by his friend, the priest of Amidaji Temple. The priest grew suspicious and instructed his servants to look after Hoichi the next night. When they saw him leaving the temple the servants gave chase and eventually found Hoichi playing his biwa furiously in the middle of the Amidaji cemetery. When they dragged him back to the temple, Hoichi explained the previous night's events to the priest.\n\nRealizing that Hoichi had been bewitched by ghosts, the priest vowed to save his friend from further trickery. He painted Hoichi's body with the kanji characters of the Heart Sutra for protection and instructed him to remain silent and motionless when he is called upon by his ghostly audience. That evening the samurai called for Hoichi as before, and was angered when he received no response. The ghostly samurai approached Hoichi but was unable to see anything but his ears. The sutra had rendered the rest of Hoichi's body invisible. Attempting to comply with his orders, the samurai ripped Hoichi's ears off as proof that they had been the only portion of the lute player that was available.\n\nAfter the ghostly retainer had left, Hoichi was still too frightened to react, despite the blood gushing from the wounds on his head. When the priest returned, he realized in dismay that he had neglected to write the sutra on Hoichi's ears, which had left them vulnerable to the spirit. Despite his injury, Hoichi's ordeal had freed him from the spirit's power, and he went on to recover from his wounds and become a famous musician.\n\nThe vintage text also names Hōichi as the biwa strumming protagonist, and is set in Akama-seki, Chōshū, at the Buddhist temple named Amidaji (all as in Hearn's version). This locale is identifiable as today's Akama Shrine in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi.\n\nA variant version collected by folklorists is called , taken down from Tokushima Prefecture (near Dannoura), and is mentioned by Kunio Yanagita in .\n\nHoichi is often referenced in the book \"Blood Ninja\" and \"Blood Ninja 2\", as the character Shusaku's choice to paint himself in order to hide from other vampires is compared to the tale of Hoichi.\n\nA fictionalized version of this tale serves as an episode of the 2003 series \"100 Tales of Horror\" (怪談百物語, \"Kaidan Hyaku Monogatari\"). In the particular episode, Hoichi's background was revised as having been originally a foot-soldier of the Heike, tasked to guard one of their princesses--one he eventually kills due to being maltreated. Afterwards, he presents the princess's head to a Genji commander, who rebukes him for betraying his charge and eventually blinding him as punishment. As his atonement, he began to perform \"The Tale of the Heike\". The storyline follows the original elements of the folktale—with the twist being the ghostly court he performs to is eventually revealed to be his former Heike compatriots, and who finally takes his ears as a final act of spite before letting him go.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Local Group and a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way galaxy. The Draco Dwarf is situated in the direction of the Draco Constellation at 34.6° above the galactic plane.\n\nPaul W. Hodge analyzed the distribution of its stars in 1964 and concluded that its ellipticity was 0.29 ± 0.04. \nRecent studies have indicated that the galaxy may potentially hold large amounts of dark matter. Having an absolute magnitude of -8.6 and a total luminosity of only , it is one of the faintest companions to our Milky Way.\n\nDraco Dwarf contains many red giant branch (RGB) stars; five carbon stars have been identified in Draco Dwarf and four likely asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars have been detected.\n\nThe Draco Dwarf is estimated to be 80 ± 10 kpc from Earth and span a distance of 830 ± 100 × 570 ± 70 pc.\n\nIn 1961, Walter Baade and Henrietta H. Swope studied Draco Dwarf and discovered over 260 variables, of the 138 in the cluster's center, all but five were determined to be RR Lyrae variables. From this work a RR Lyrae derived distance modulus of 19.55 is found which implies a distance of 81 kpc.\n\nThe Draco Dwarf contains primarily an old population of stars and insignificant amounts of interstellar matter (being basically dust free). From 75% to 90% of its stars formed more than ~10 Gyr ago followed by a low rate of formation with a small burst of star formation around 2-3 Gyr ago. It has a single Gaussian distribution with average metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.74 dex with a standard deviation (sigma/σ) of 0.24 dex and a small tail of metal-rich stars. The central region of Draco Dwarf exhibits a concentration of more metal-rich stars there being more centrally concentrated red horizontal branch stars than blue horizontal branch stars.\n\nRecently, dwarf spheroidal galaxies have become key objects for the study of dark matter. The Draco Dwarf is one which has received specific attention. Radial velocity computations of Draco have revealed a large internal velocity dispersion giving a mass to luminosity ratio of up to /, suggesting large amounts of dark matter. It has been hypothesized that large velocity dispersions could be explained as \"tidal dwarfs\" (virtually unbound stellar streams from dwarf galaxies tidally disrupted in the Milky Way potential). However, Draco Dwarf's narrow horizontal branch width does not support this model. This only leaves the dark matter explanation and makes Draco Dwarf the most dark matter dominated object known as of 2007. The dark matter distribution within Draco Dwarf is at least nearly isothermal.\n\nAt large radii, radial velocity dispersion exhibit strange behavior. One possible explanation for this would be the presence of more than one stellar population. This suggests the need for further study of Draco Dwarf population's metallicity and ages and of dwarf spheroidals in general.\n"}

Lupoff\n\nRichard Allen Lupoff (born February 21, 1935) is an American science fiction and mystery author, who has also written humor, satire, non-fiction and reviews. In addition to his two dozen novels and more than 40 short stories, he has also edited science-fantasy anthologies. He is an expert on the writing of Edgar Rice Burroughs and has an equally strong interest in H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nBorn February 21, 1935 in Brooklyn, New York, into a Jewish family, Lupoff began his writing career in science fiction fandom in the 1950s, working on a number of science fiction fanzines including \"Xero\", which he edited in the early 1960s with his wife Pat and Bhob Stewart. It received the Hugo Award for Best Fanzine in 1963. The roster of contributors included such names as Dan Adkins, James Blish, Lin Carter, Avram Davidson, L. Sprague de Camp, Roger Ebert (then 19 years of age), Harlan Ellison, Ed Gorman, Eddie Jones, Roy G. Krenkel, Frederik Pohl and Bob Tucker. In 2004, a hardcover anthology, \"The Best of Xero\", coedited with Pat Lupoff and featuring a nostalgic introduction by Ebert, was published by Tachyon Publications. It was in turn nominated for the Hugo Award.\n\nLupoff also wrote reviews for the fanzine \"Algol\", and he was an editor of Edgar Rice Burroughs for Canaveral Press. In a memoir for \"Omni On-Line\", he recalled the chain of events that led him to write his 1965 biography of Burroughs (reprinted in 2005 by the University of Nebraska Press' Bison Books):\n\nHe began publishing fiction in 1967 with the novel \"One Million Centuries\", followed by \"Sacred Locomotive Flies\" (1971) and \"Into the Aether\" (1974). He is credited with more than 50 books, plus short fiction, non-fiction and memoirs. He sometimes wrote under pseudonyms, such as Ova Hamlet, a name he frequently used for parodies. Pastiche and recursiveness are features of his writing: \"pastiche\" in that much of his work involves writing stories that play with styles or even universes created by other writers; \"recursiveness\" meaning that his work often includes other authors or friends as characters.\n\nAmong his best-known novels are the duology \"Circumpolar!\" (1984) and \"Countersolar!\" (1985). His novel \"Sword of the Demon\" was nominated for the 1977 Nebula Award. Robert Silverberg described it as \"a strange and austerely beautiful fable that cuts across genre lines.\"\n\nHis short fiction, which has often been collected and anthologized, includes the short story \"\". Originally in the December 1973 issue of \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\", the story was adapted into both the Oscar-nominated short film \"\" (1990) and the TV movie \"\" (1993). Lupoff appeared in both films as an extra. The major plot device is a time loop, and bears great similarity to that of 1993's \"Groundhog Day\". Lupoff and Jonathan Heap, director of the 1990 film, were \"outraged\" by the apparent theft of the idea, but after six months of lawyers' conferences, they decided to drop the case against Columbia Pictures.\n\nHis novelette \"After the Dreamtime\" and his short story \"Sail the Tide of Mourning\" received Hugo Award nominations in 1975 and 1976. His first collection of short mystery stories is \"Quintet: The Cases of Chase and Delacroix\" (Crippen & Landru, 2008).\n\nHis and Steve Stiles' collaborative graphic novel \"The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer\", originally a series of comic strips in \"Heavy Metal\", is considered a forerunner of steampunk.\n\nStarting in 1977, Lupoff co-hosted a program on Pacifica Radio station KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California that featured book reviews and interviews, primarily with science fiction (and mystery) authors. Originally an occasional one-hour program called \"Probabilities Unlimited\", after several months it became a regular weekly, half-hour program called simply \"Probabilities\", which aired until 1995. The program relaunched that year as \"Cover to Cover\"; Lupoff departed in 2001 to focus on his writing career. Among the notable authors interviewed by Lupoff and his co-host, Richard Wolinsky, were such luminaries as Ray Bradbury, Octavia Butler, Richard Adams, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Kurt Vonnegut.\n\n\n\n"}

They lived in Skiritis, a mountainous region located in northern Laconia on the border with Arcadia, between the Oenus and the Eurotas rivers.\n\nAccording to Stephanus of Byzantium and Hesychius of Alexandria, the Sciritae were of Arcadian origin. Their way of life was essentially rural: they mostly lived in villages, of which the biggest were Oion and Caryai. Their territory was inhospitable, but was of strategic importance for Sparta since it controlled the road to Tegea, which explains why it rapidly fell in Spartan hands. Their status was similar to that of the Perioeci, but Xenophon distinguished between them, writing, 'To meet the case of a hostile approach at night, he assigned the duty of acting as sentries outside the lines to the Sciritae. In these days the duty is shared by foreigners, if any happen to be present in the camp.'\n\nIn war the Sciritae formed an elite corps of light infantry, a \"lochos\" (battalion) of about 600 men, which were used as a complement to the civic army. According to Thucydides (v. 67), they fought on the extreme-left wing in the battle-line, the most threatening position for the hoplite phalanx: \"In this battle the left wing was composed of the Sciritae, who in a Lacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone\". At night, they were placed as sentinels ahead of the army (Xenophon, \"Constitution of the Spartans\", xii. 3) and acted as scouts to open the way for the king, whom they only could precede.\n\nIn the \"Cyropaedia\" (IV, 2), Xenophon compares them to the Hyrcanian cavalry, used by the Assyrians as rear-guard.\n\n\n\n"}

She also appeared as Rhonda McNeil in the NBC's comedy-drama series \"You, Me and the Apocalypse\". Fischer also starred in the ABC sitcom \"Splitting Up Together\" (2018–2019).\n\nFischer's first book, \"The Actor's Life: A Survival Guide\", with an introduction by Steve Carell, was published in November 2017.\n\nFischer was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. Her mother, Anne (née Miller), is a history teacher; her father, James E. \"Jim\" Fischer, is an engineer. She has one younger sister, Emily, a third grade teacher. She first performed at the age of six, when she participated in an acting workshop taught by her mother at Henry School in St. Louis, a workshop also attended by actor Sean Gunn, with whom she grew up.\n\nFischer attended Pierremont Elementary School in Manchester, Missouri, and Nerinx Hall High School, a private all-girls Catholic school, in Webster Groves, Missouri. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in theater, as well as a minor in journalism, from Truman State University, where she originally enrolled as a pre-law history major.\n\nWhile attending college at Truman State in Missouri, Fischer performed with a touring Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre group.\n\nUpon her move to Los Angeles in 1998, Fischer began performing \"Commedia dell'arte\" with the Zoo District Theatre. She was noticed by a talent agent because of her appearance in a musical theater adaptation of the film \"Nosferatu\" (1922) with Zoo District Theatre company. This led to her signing a contract with that agent.\n\nFischer struggled to break into film and television. Her first paying film role was a sex education video for psychiatric patients upon their release from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.\n\nThree years elapsed from the time she arrived in California until Fischer landed her first televised speaking role. She played the part of a waitress on the television sitcom \"Spin City\" in 2001.\n\nFischer appeared in bit parts in small independent films during her early years in Southern California, including \"Employee of the Month\", \"Lucky 13\", and \"The Specials\".\n\nOn television, she performed as a guest on shows including \"Six Feet Under\", \"That '70s Show\", \"Cold Case\", \"Miss Match\", \"Strong Medicine\", \"Undeclared\", \"What I Like About You\", and \"Off Centre\".\n\nWhile her film career was slowly taking off, Fischer took matters into her own hands, writing, directing and starring in her own mockumentary, \"LolliLove\", her only directing credit. The film co-starred her then-husband James Gunn, as well as friends Linda Cardellini, Judy Greer, Lloyd Kaufman, and Jason Segel. She began participating in \"The Artist's Way\", a self-led creativity seminar in book form. \"From doing that book I got this idea... When we started it, it wasn't even supposed to be a real movie. It was just going to be an improv project for James and I to amuse ourselves with.\" Utilizing a camera she gave Gunn as a wedding present, she filmed preliminary improvisational interviews with her friends in the faux documentary format that would later bring her fame on \"The Office\". \"I really feel it was divine intervention that I chose to work in this medium for a year,\" she said in an interview. \"It was the super best practice I could have ever gotten for the possibility of being on the show.\"\n\n\"LolliLove\" premiered at the St. Louis International Film Festival, the hometown of Fischer and Gunn, in November 2004, and was also shown at the TromaDance Film Festival. For her role in the film, Fischer was awarded a Screen Actors Guild Emerging Actor Award. Despite the film's contribution to her career, she admitted to a St. Louis arts and entertainment magazine that the experience dissuaded her from any future directing:\n\nIn 2005, after a succession of mostly improvised auditions similar to her \"LolliLove\" experience, Fischer landed the role of Pam Beesly on what would become the NBC hit, \"The Office\", based on the original BBC series. Before her initial audition, casting director Allison Jones advised Fischer, \"Dare to bore me.\" Fischer herself spent several years working as a receptionist and administrative assistant in Los Angeles offices, much like her television counterpart, while struggling to achieve success, and thus felt she was well-suited to the role. \"I'm so attached to Pam's journey,\" she told NPR in 2009. \"I just love playing this character so, so much.\" In 2007, she received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nSoon after \"The Office\" premiered, Fischer was focused on the show's success; in an April 2005 interview with her alma mater's student newspaper, she said: \"Honestly it would be great to get to play Pam for a long, long time ... I don't have real big aspirations to be a movie star. I would love to be on a long-running hit TV show. You end up playing a defining role.\" As \"The Office\" grew into a success, Fischer's film acting career became more established. In 2006, she co-starred in her then-husband's film, \"Slither\", and in 2007, she filmed supporting roles in \"The Brothers Solomon\", with Will Arnett and Will Forte, \"Blades of Glory\", with Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, and \"\", alongside John C. Reilly, with whom she co-starred again in 2008's \"The Promotion\", also starring Seann William Scott.\n\nIn 2009, Fischer completed filming on the movies \"Solitary Man\" and the indie \"A Little Help\", which opened in the summer of 2010 at the Seattle International Film Festival. Also that summer, she completed filming on the Farrelly brothers comedy \"Hall Pass\", which was released in February 2011.\n\nFischer appeared on Bravo's \"Celebrity Poker Showdown\" in 2006, participating in the show's eighth tournament, shot in New Orleans, Louisiana, and playing for Catholic Charities' Tsunami Relief.\n\nIn 2007, Fischer starred in the music video for Willie Wisely's single \"Through Any Window\", directed by longtime friend John Cabrera; the opportunity arose because she knew Wisely from work he had done on soundtracks for \"LolliLove\" and \"Tromeo and Juliet\", one of her husband's films.\n\nIn December of the same year, during the Hollywood writer's strike, Fischer appeared at Sacred Fools Theater Company in episode 25 of \"Darque Magick\", a serialized play written and directed by Jenelle Riley.\n\nIn July 2009, Fischer played left field for the National League team in the Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game as part of the MLB All-Star Week festivities, held at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, where she grew up.\n\nIn March 2010, Fischer returned to the area to co-chair an annual auction for Nerinx Hall High School, her alma mater. At the event, she auctioned off a set visit to \"The Office\" and multiple autographed props from the show.\n\nFischer was named an official spokeswoman for Proactiv Skincare Solutions in 2009 and was announced as the voice behind the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board Grilled Cheese Academy website in 2010.\n\nFischer was named as producer of the mid-August through October 2010 run of the critically acclaimed play \"Sad Happy Sucker\", written by her husband Lee Kirk and directed by friend Sean Gunn. The play previously ran as a theatre workshop in February and March 2007.\n\nAfter finishing \"The Office\", Fischer starred in the Off-Broadway play \"Reasons to Be Happy\", written and directed by Neil LaBute, which ran from May to June 2013.\n\nFischer starred in the world premiere of Steve Martin's comedy \"Meteor Shower\" at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California, from July 30 to September 18, 2016. Fischer worked alongside actor Greg Germann, Alexandra Henrikson, and Josh Stamberg.\n\nOn September 11, 2019, Fischer announced via Twitter that she and Angela Kinsey will be co-hosting a weekly podcast called \"Office Ladies\". According to her announcement, she and Kinsey will \"watch an episode of The Office and give you all the stories and behind-the-scenes scoop...as well as some BFF banter about our lives.\" The first episode of \"Office Ladies\" was released October 16, 2019.\n\nAfter Fischer moved to Los Angeles, her childhood friend Sean Gunn helped her get a part in a showcase and then introduced her to his brother, screenwriter James Gunn. That small part in a showcase also led to Fischer getting her first manager. Fischer married James Gunn on October 7, 2000. They announced their separation in September 2007, and they divorced in 2008. In 2010, Fischer helped Gunn with casting Rainn Wilson, her \"The Office\" co-star, in Gunn's film \"Super\".\n\nIn June 2009, Fischer's engagement to screenwriter Lee Kirk was announced, and they married on July 3, 2010. Fischer and Kirk announced her pregnancy with their first child in May 2011; the pregnancy coincided with her character's second pregnancy on \"The Office\"s eighth season. In September 2011, Fischer gave birth to their son. Fischer gave birth to their second child, a daughter, in May 2014.\n\nFischer is passionate about animal rescue, and she is involved with the Los Angeles organizations Kitten Rescue and Rescue Rover. Before \"The Office\", she worked for three years doing hands-on rescue work for the organizations. She regularly fosters cats and hosted Kitten Rescue's annual Fur Ball Gala in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\nOn April 17, 2018, Fischer was a guest of an event at DePauw University that was interrupted by students who were protesting against the allegedly racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic slurs found on campus. In response to the protests, Fischer announced she would donate the money she received from DePauw to the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and The Trevor Project.\n\n"}

{"id": "2303500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303500", "title": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis", "text": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) or extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) is a rare immune system disorder that affects the lungs. It is an inflammation of the alveoli (airspaces) within the lung caused by hypersensitivity to inhaled organic dusts. Sufferers are commonly exposed to the dust by their occupation or hobbies.\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of the illness.\n\nIn the acute form of HP, symptoms may develop 4–6 hours following heavy exposure to the provoking antigen. Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, rash, swelling and headache. Symptoms resolve within 12 hours to several days upon cessation of exposure.\n\nAcute HP is characterized by poorly formed noncaseating interstitial granulomas and mononuclear cell infiltration in a peribronchial distribution with prominent giant cells.\n\nOn chest radiographs, a diffuse micronodular interstitial pattern (at times with ground-glass density in the lower and middle lung zones) may be observed. Findings are normal in approximately 10% of patients.\" In high-resolution CT scans, ground-glass opacities or diffusely increased radiodensities are present. Pulmonary function tests show reduced diffusion capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Many patients have hypoxemia at rest, and all patients desaturate with exercise. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may eventually lead to Interstitial lung disease.\n\nPatients with subacute HP gradually develop a productive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and pleurisy. Symptoms are similar to the acute form of the disease, but are less severe and last longer. On chest radiographs, micronodular or reticular opacities are most prominent in mid-to-lower lung zones. Findings may be present in patients who have experienced repeated acute attacks.\n\nThe subacute, or intermittent, form produces more well-formed noncaseating granulomas, bronchiolitis with or without organizing pneumonia, and interstitial fibrosis.\n\nIn chronic HP, patients often lack a history of acute episodes. They have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. This is associated with partial to complete but gradual reversibility. Avoiding any further exposure is recommended. Clubbing is observed in 50% of patients. Tachypnea, respiratory distress, and inspiratory crackles over lower lung fields often are present.\n\nOn chest radiographs, progressive fibrotic changes with loss of lung volume particularly affect the upper lobes. Nodular or ground-glass opacities are not present. Features of emphysema are found on significant chest films and CT scans.\n\nChronic forms reveal additional findings of chronic interstitial inflammation and alveolar destruction (honeycombing) associated with dense fibrosis. Cholesterol clefts or asteroid bodies are present within or outside granulomas.\n\nIn addition, many patients have hypoxemia at rest, and all patients desaturate with exercise.\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis involves inhalation of an antigen. This leads to an exaggerated immune response (hypersensitivity). Type III hypersensitivity and type IV hypersensitivity can both occur depending on the cause.\n\nThe diagnosis is based upon a history of symptoms after exposure to the allergen and clinical tests. A physician may take blood tests, seeking signs of inflammation, a chest X-ray and lung function tests. The sufferer shows a restrictive loss of lung function.\n\nPrecipitating IgG antibodies against fungal or avian antigens can be detected in the laboratory using the traditional Ouchterlony immunodiffusion method wherein 'precipitin' lines form on agar plate. The ImmunoCAP technology has replaced this time-consuming, labor-intensive method with their automated CAP assays and FEIA (Fluorescence enzyme immunoassay) that can detect IgG antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus (Farmer's lung or for ABPA) or avian antigens (Bird Fancier's Lung).\nAlthough overlapping in many cases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be distinguished from occupational asthma in that it is not restricted to only occupational exposure, and that asthma generally is classified as a type I hypersensitivity. Unlike asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis targets lung alveoli rather than bronchi.\n\nLung biopsies can be diagnostic in cases of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or may help to suggest the diagnosis and trigger or intensify the search for an allergen. The main feature of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis on lung biopsies is expansion of the interstitium by lymphocytes accompanied by an occasional multinucleated giant cell or loose granuloma.\n\nWhen fibrosis develops in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the differential diagnosis in lung biopsies includes the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. This group of diseases includes usual interstitial pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, among others.\n\nThe prognosis of some idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, e.g. idiopathic usual interstitial pneumonia (i.e. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), are very poor and the treatments of little help. This contrasts the prognosis (and treatment) for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is generally fairly good if the allergen is identified and exposures to it significantly reduced or eliminated. Thus, a lung biopsy, in some cases, may make a decisive difference.\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be called many different names, based on the provoking antigen. These include:\n\nOf these types, Farmer's Lung and Bird-Breeder's Lung are the most common. \"Studies document 8-540 cases per 100,000 persons per year for farmers and 6000-21,000 cases per 100,000 persons per year for pigeon breeders. High attack rates are documented in sporadic outbreaks. Prevalence varies by region, climate, and farming practices. HP affects 0.4–7% of the farming population. Reported prevalence among bird fanciers is estimated to be 20-20,000 cases per 100,000 persons at risk.\" \n\nThe best treatment is to avoid the provoking allergen, as chronic exposure can cause permanent damage. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone may help to control symptoms but may produce side-effects.\n"}

At the age of 27 he was killed in the 1964 Indianapolis 500. In his four-year racing career, MacDonald competed in 118 races with 52 victories and 75 top-three finishes.\n\nMacDonald was inducted into the National Corvette Museum's Corvette Hall of Fame in 2014, and into the United States Road Racing Championship (USRRC) Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nMacDonald began racing in 1956, running a ’55 Chevrolet Corvette on Southern Californian drag strips. He won nearly 100 trophies between 1956 and 1959, all in Corvettes.\n\nAt the 1958 NHRA Western US Drag Racing Championships at Chandler Air Force Base in Arizona, MacDonald set two standing start speed records in a stock '58 Corvette - 104.68 mph in the ¼ mile and 123.11 mph in the 1/2 mile. Between 1958-1962 he drove Corvettes to six more speed records in the 1/4, 1/2 and one-mile distances at annual US speed trials.\n\nMacDonald moved to the road racing circuit in 1960, and his first race was at Willow Springs Raceway on February 13–14. He ran a ’57 Corvette to a fourth place finish, behind winner Bob Bondurant in Saturday’s preliminary race, and then won Sunday’s feature race to record his first ever victory. At the end of the 1962 season, he had driven Corvettes to 28 victories in 64 races, including 42 top-three finishes. MacDonald’s unique style of drifting through turns at full speed made him a crowd favorite and earned him the nickname \"Master of Oversteer\".\nIn June 1962, Zora Arkus-Duntov selected Dave MacDonald and Dick Thompson to do the shakedown testing during development of Chevrolet's all new 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. Four days of all-out road testing were performed on a coupe and a convertible at the General Motors Proving Grounds in Milford, Michigan. General Motors used footage from these tests to create a promotional film entitled \"\"Biography of a Sports Car\"\". The film was distributed around the globe as part of GM's marketing campaign promoting the new sports car. In September Duntov and other Chevrolet executives presented MacDonald with the first ever 1963 Z06 Sting Ray that he race debuted at Riverside Raceway on October 13, 1962. The highly anticipated race also marked the debut of Carroll Shelby’s new Ford Cobra Roadster. MacDonald and Cobra driver Billy Krause exchanged the lead during the first hour before both cars dropped out with mechanical troubles.\n\nAt the start of the 1963 season, Carroll Shelby hired MacDonald away from Chevrolet to drive his Cobra Roadster. His first outing for Shelby American was February 2–3 at Riverside International Raceway and he drove Cobra CSX2026 to back-to-back victories. These were the Cobra’s first wins. Teammate Ken Miles finished second both days in Cobra CSX2002.\n\nOn February 17, 1963, MacDonald finished fourth in Cobra CSX2026 at the FIA Daytona Continental to give the Cobra its first top-five finish in international competition. Shelby retired the 260ci engines after this race and debuted the new Ford 289ci engine at the SCCA sanctioned races at Dodger Stadium on March 3–4, 1963. MacDonald again won both days in Cobra CSX2026 for the 289's first wins.\nIn the fall of 1963, MacDonald rose to national prominence after driving Shelby King Cobra CM/1/63 to back-to-back grand prix wins in the two biggest and richest road races in the world - the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix and the Monterey Pacific Grand Prix. These were the first wins for the Shelby King Cobra. In his next three races he finished second at the Hawaiian Grand Prix in Cobra Roadster CSX2136, second at NASCAR’s Golden State 400 in the Wood Brothers No. 21 Ford and second in NASCAR’s Augusta 510 behind Holman/Moody teammate and race winner Fireball Roberts. For his efforts, MacDonald was awarded the Helms Athletic Foundation’s \"Athlete of the Month\" medallion for October 1963. The award was first issued in 1936 and given to the athlete who most dominated his or her sport through outstanding performance. MacDonald was only the ninth auto racer to receive this honor and the first during the US football season.\n\n1964 would be MacDonald's final year in racing. He remained committed to a full Cobra schedule with Shelby American but also signed to run 20 races on the NASCAR circuit for Mercury team owner Bill Stroppe. MacDonald also signed a two-year contract with Mickey Thompson to run the 1964 and ’65 Indianapolis 500's.\n\nOn February 23, 1964, Dave MacDonald competed in his first and only Daytona 500, he finished 10th against a field NASCAR.com considers the greatest in NASCAR history Richard Petty won the '64 race, capturing his first of seven Daytona 500s.\n\nMarch 1, 1964, MacDonald won the United States Road Racing Championships at Augusta International Raceway in Shelby King Cobra CM/1/63. His average speed of 97.653 MPH was 11 MPH faster than the previous track record set by Fireball Roberts in the Augusta 510. After this victory, hall of fame motor sports journalist, Chris Economaki, wrote that, \"Dave MacDonald just stamped himself as one of today's road racing greats\".\n\nOn March 21, 1964, MacDonald and co-driver Bob Holbert ran Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe CSX2287 to the GT Class win (fourth overall) in the 12 Hours of Sebring international endurance race. This was the first win for the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupes while also breaking Ferrari's 6-year win streak in the Grand Touring Division.\n\nOn April 19, 1964, MacDonald won the Phoenix FIA National Open at Phoenix International Raceway in Shelby King Cobra-Lang Cooper CM/1/64. This was the debut outing for CM/1/64 and its first win.\n\nOn May 3, 1964, MacDonald finished 2nd in the United States Road Racing Championships at Laguna Seca Raceway in Shelby King Cobra CM/1/64. He finished between the Chaparrals of race winner Jim Hall and 3rd-place finisher Roger Penske.\n\nOn May 10, 1964, MacDonald won the United States Road Racing Championships at Kent, Washington in King Cobra CM/3/63. The victory put him in a tie atop the USRRC Drivers' Championship standings with Jim Hall, who he invited to share the victory lap. This would be MacDonald's last race before his death three weeks later in the Indy 500.\n\nMickey Thompson hired MacDonald to drive one of his radical low profile rear-engine race cars in the 1964 Indy 500. Thompson's Ford-powered racers were specifically designed to run on 12\" tires and, after debuting in the 1963 Indy 500, the cars became known as \"roller skates\". They were far ahead of their time, but badly designed and difficult to drive. Graham Hill tested the car before the '63 Indy race and refused to drive it because of its poor handling, a condition made worse for 1964 when Thompson was forced to completely redesign the cars to accommodate the new USAC-mandated minimum tire height. \n\nOne of the changes Thompson made to improve stability was to fit his cars with full-fendered aerodynamic body kits, unheard of at Indy's open-wheeled speedway. Thompson hired MacDonald, a rookie at Indy, and veteran racer Masten Gregory to drive two of his three cars in 1964, but several of the top drivers declined offers to drive the revolutionary but undeveloped cars. Graham Hill tested Thompson's new ‘64 design and, like the previous year decided against driving it in the race. Thompson selected Duane Carter to join Gregory and MacDonald, and in the first week of May, all three cars crashed or spun in practice. Gregory abruptly quit the team, citing the poor handling of his car, and Thompson found it difficult to find a replacement, as other available drivers took the advice of Gregory and stayed away. Fifteen-time Indy 500 competitor Eddie Johnson did accept Thompson’s offer and joined the team in mid-May. It was reported that while out practicing with MacDonald on Carb Day, 1963 World Champion Jim Clark noticed strange movements from MacDonald's car, followed him into the pits and urged him to \"Get out of that car, mate - just walk away.\" According to journalist Chris Economaki, MacDonald never practiced with a full load of fuel due to Thompson's focus on high speeds. Despite handling woes, MacDonald qualified the Thompson No. 83 car at an average speed of 151.464 mph, placing him in the middle of row five and in 14th position. Johnson qualified Gregory's reconstructed No. 84 car, and placed it on the outside of row eight and in 24th position. On Bump Day, the final day of qualifying, Thompson hired Chuck Arnold (15th in the 1959 Indy 500) to put the 82 in the field and drive it in the race. While preparing for his qualifying attempt Arnold spun twice in separate practice runs and walked away from the ride. With just a few hours left in qualifying Thompson sought out Gregory and asked if he'd come back to the team and run the No. 82 car. Gregory, still without a ride for the 500, agreed to try and qualify the 82 but not run it in the race. Gregory's late day attempt fell short on speed and neither he nor the No. 82 ran the 500.\n\nMacDonald started in the 14th position in the 1964 Indy 500, and after dropping two positions on the first lap, he began passing cars and moving toward the leaders. As he passed Johnny Rutherford and Eddie Sachs, Rutherford noticed that MacDonald's car was very loose. Rutherford later said that, watching the behavior of MacDonald's car, he thought, \"Whoa, he's either going to win this thing or crash.\" MacDonald was in the 10th position as he came out of turn four and on to the front straight to complete lap two. MacDonald moved left to pass Walt Hansgen and a split second later Hangsen moved left to pass Jim Hurtubise. MacDonald moved left again to avoid Hansgen and the front end of his car lifted and he lost control. His car slid across the track and hit the inside retaining wall, igniting the 45 gallon fuel load and causing a massive fire. His car then slid back up the track toward the outside wall and six more cars became involved. Eddie Sachs, blinded by flames and smoke, broadsided MacDonald's car, resulting in another fireball. For the first time in its history, the Indianapolis 500 was stopped because of an accident. According to reports, Sachs died instantly due to blunt-force injuries, while MacDonald was transported to Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis and died two hours later. Eddie Johnson retired the other Thompson car after only six laps. The fiery crash led to safety changes at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, including a USAC requirement that cars carry less fuel, a change that led every team to switch from gasoline to methanol prior to the next year's Indy 500.\n\nCarroll Shelby, Mickey Thompson, Bill Stroppe and Don Steves were among the pallbearers serving at MacDonald's funeral.\n\n\n"}

The parish includes the state capital of Baton Rouge and smaller suburban cities such as Baker, Central City, and Zachary.\n\nHe was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate in the November 21, 2015 race for lieutenant governor. Victory went to the Republican Billy Nungesser.\n\nHe vacated his position as Mayor-President at the end of 2016 and was succeeded by Sharon Weston Broome, another member of the Democratic Party.\n\nHe studied at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in Journalism in 1974. He then studied at Southern University in Baton Rouge where he graduatd Master of Arts in Journalism in 1982. He ethen went to Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge where he graduated a Juris Doctor in 1985.\n\nPrevious to his political career, Holden was a journalist and later an attorney.\n\nHe also worked Louisiana Department of Labor as a Clerk in the Workers' Compensation Office, at the Baton Rouge City Police as a Public information officer, at the United States Census Bureau as Public relations specialist. He also worked at WXOK Radi in Port Allen as a News director (in 1975 and 1977), at WWL Radio in New Orleans as a Reporter (in 1977 and 1978), and at WBRZ Channel 2, Baton Rouge as a Reporter (in 1978 and 1979).\n\nSince 1991 he has been an Adjunct Professor of Law at Southern University Law Center - Baton Rouge.\n\nHe was a Member of the Baton Rouge Metro Council from District 2 from 1984 until 1988. He represented Louisiana State Representative from District 63 from 1988 until 2002. He served as Louisiana State Senator from District 15 from 2002 until 2004\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully for mayor-president of Baton Rouge in 1996 and 2000.\n\nHolden was elected mayor-president on November 3, 2004, when he unseated the Republican incumbent, Bobby Simpson of Baker. Holden was inaugurated on January 3, 2005.\n\nThe 2004 race was Holden's third attempt to win the mayor-presidency. In 1996, he had failed in a bid to unseat Democrat-turned-Republican Mayor-President Tom Ed McHugh of Zachary, later the executive director of the Louisiana Municipal Association.\n\nHolden's election as the first African-American Mayor-President of East Baton Rouge Parish was fostered through the support of his urban black base but also with substantial support from suburban whites, many being Republicans. Support from the latter group was buoyed by backing from Jim Bernhard, CEO of The Shaw Group, and several other figures in business and industry. The dissatisfaction with Mayor-President Simpson was demonstrated in dramatic fashion by the fact that President Bush received 54 percent of the parish vote in his re-election campaign, and then U.S. Representative Richard Hugh Baker received 69 percent. In the same election Holden matched Bush's 54 percent parishwide total.\n\nOn taking office, Holden retained Walter Monsour, a Republican lawyer originally from Shreveport, as the chief administrative officer, even though Monsour had supported Simpson's reelection. Monsour told Holden that he would take the position if Holden agreed to treat all areas of the parish equally whether or not those precincts voted for Holden. Monsour had held the same post twenty years earlier in 1985 under then Democratic Mayor-President Pat Screen and was credited with resolving fiscal problems that developed in Screen's second term. Early in 2009, Monsour stepped down as CAO and was replaced by his assistant, former Republican State Representative Mike Futrell, a native of Baton Rouge. In 2012, Holden tapped a former mayoral rival from 2004, William Daniel, as the chief administrative officer, a position which Daniel still holds. Daniel is a petroleum engineer and a former state representative for District 68 in East Baton Rouge Parish.\n\nHolden became a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by Mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York City and Thomas Menino of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2008, Holden was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.\n\nIn 2008, Holden was elected with 71% of the vote.\n\nHolden handily won reelection in the nonpartisan blanket primary held in conjunction with the national election on November 6, 2012. One of his opponents, Republican J. Michael \"Mike\" Walker, Sr., a member of the Metro Council, questioned Holden and the city-parish for having provided security services for Louis Farrakhan when the Nation of Islam spokesman addressed a group on October 3 at Southern University. Walker's advertisement includes a video of Farrakhan thanking Holden and the police chief for security services and Farrakhan's escort to Baton Rouge from the airport in New Orleans.\n\nWith 115,305 votes (60 percent), Holden defeated three opponents. Walker finished second with 65,972 ballots (34.3 percent). Two Independents held the remaining 5.7 percent of the vote.\n\nIn August 2014, Holden announced that he was seeking the position of lieutenant governor in 2015, as the incumbent Republican Jay Dardenne, also of Baton Rouge, challenged U.S. Senator David Vitter for the right to succeed the term-limited Republican Governor Bobby Jindal as well as the front-running Democratic candidate John Bel Edwards. Holden's opponents included three Republicans: State Senator Elbert Guillory of St. Landry Parish, who spoke out against the unsuccessful re-election bid of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu in the 2014 election; John Young, president of Jefferson Parish; and Billy Nungesser, the former president of Plaquemines Parish and former candidate for lieutenant governor in 2011. The position is focused upon the promotion of tourism in Louisiana.\n\nHolden led the four-candidate field in the primary with 360,679 votes (33.3 percent), qualifying him to face Nungesser in a runoff, who finished second in the primary with 324,654 votes (30 percent). In a strong third-place was John Young, who polled 313,183 votes (28.9 percent). Departing State Senator Elbert Guillory ran last with 85,460 votes (7.9 percent).\nIn the second round of balloting, Nungesser finished with 628,864 votes (55.4 percent) to Holden's 506,578 (44.6 percent). Holden nevertheless was an easy winner in populous Orleans and East Baton Rouge parishes.\n\nIn 2016, Holden, who was term-limited as Mayor-President in Baton Rouge, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House to represent Louisiana's 2nd congressional district held by fellow Democrat Cedric Richmond. The district has long been based in New Orleans, but had been redrawn after the 2010 census to include a slice of western Baton Rouge, including most of the capital's black precincts. \n\nHolden finished with only 20 percent of the ballots cast to Richmond's 70 percent. Sharon Weston Broome, who had succeeded Holden in the state Senate, also succeeded him as Mayor-President after her 52-48 percent victory over Republican state Senator Bodi White in the runoff election held on December 10, 2016.\n\nHolden is one of five children, two deceased, of the late Mr. and Mrs. Curtis Lee Holden, Sr. He has two sisters, Evelyn and Brenda Holden. His older brother, Curtis Holden, Jr. (1950-2013), a native of Woodville, Mississippi, was a retired employee of the Baton Rouge municipal public works department. Prior to his death from complications resulting from two strokes, Curtis Holden, Jr., had operated Holden's Powerhouse, a family-owned bar in the Scotlandville neighborhood of Baton Rouge.\n\nMarried to the former Lois Stevenson, Holden has five children, Melvin, II, Monique, Angela, Myron, and Brian-Micheal.\n\n"}

{"id": "2303529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303529", "title": "Parallel play", "text": "Parallel play\n\nParallel play is a form of play in which children play adjacent to each other, but do not try to influence one another's behavior. Children usually play alone during parallel play but are interested in what other children are doing. This usually occurs after the first birthday. It usually involves two or more children in the same room who are interested in the same toy, each seeing the toy as their own. The children do not play together, but alongside each other simply because they are in the same room. Parallel play is usually first observed in children aged 2–3. An observer will notice that the children occasionally see what the others are doing and then modify their play accordingly. The older the children are, the less frequently they engage in this type of play. However, even older preschool children engage in parallel play, an enduring and frequent activity over the preschool years. The image of parallel play is two children playing side-by-side in a sandbox, each absorbed in his or her game, not interacting with the other. \"This is considered an early stage in child development, characterized by egocentric behavior and the inability to decenter and coordinate with the activities of a 'playmate'\".\n\nIn education, parallel play also describes activities where students are divided into pairs or small groups and work on the same activity simultaneously. This gives all students equal opportunity for active involvement and reduces exposure – since all students are playing, none are watching.\" This stage ends when a child develops the ability to engage in interactive play behavior and symbolic communication.\n\nMildred Parten was one of the first to study peer sociability among 2 to 5-year-olds in 1932. Parten noticed a dramatic rise of interactive play with age and concluded that social development includes three stages. Parallel play is the first of three stages of play observed in young children. The other two stages include simple social play (playing and sharing together), and finally cooperative play (different complementary roles; shared purpose). The research by Parten indicated that preschool children prefer groups of two, parallel play was less likely with age, a majority of the kids chose playmates of the same sex and sand play along with constructive work were the most common parallel play activities. Other findings in her study showed that I.Q. level had little impact, siblings preferred to play with each other, home environment was a big factor and playing house was the most common form of social play among children. Research indicates that these forms of play emerge in the order suggested by Parten, but they do not form a developmental sequence in which later-appearing ones replace earlier ones. All types coexist during the preschool years. Vygotsky believed that play during childhood created a zone of proximal development of the child and guided in intellectual development. Socioeconomic status appeared to only impact associative play, where British children who were used in the study of low socioeconomic status preferred that type of play. This could be explained due to the fact that those kids had fewer toys and more siblings to share toys with.\n\nParallel play helps children begin language development and create social relationships. \"Rubin et al.(1976) have suggested that those who play beside others may desire the company of other children but may not yet have the skills required to play in an associative or cooperative manner\". It can also assist with gross and fine motor skills, through the child's own individualized play. Parallel play can increase confidence because children are learning to play near others. Children can observe one another and learn to use new skills from playing alongside others. Eventually, it will lead to social development where the child will form relationships with others during play. Parallel play can be useful in encouraging expression of a child's feelings through their own individualized play. The child will increasingly learn to share and become aware of others emotions, as well as learn cause and effect through trial and error of adjusting and solving problems in play.\n\"Parallel play is often viewed as characteristics of a “stage” through which children pass as they develop from solitary players to social players\". Children will undergo different playing stages in order to finally join people in groups. Analysis published in 2003 in Early Childhood Research Quarterly showed that preschool children, who enjoy watching others engage in parallel play, can have future activities designed to help with transition into higher levels of social interaction. The parallel-play activities can help neglected or rejected children with social transition between social-play states. Smith believed parallel play to be optional and not \n\"After Parallel play, children were most likely to be found in either Together or Group Play\". This suggests that parallel play played an important role to this transition.\n\nAccording to a study performed by Wei Peng and Julia Crouse, parallel play can be used to design games, especially active video games that involve physical activity, to be more effective. Playing with other people, even if those individuals are strangers, was more motivational than playing alone and there does not appear to be a major difference in cooperation and competition between same physical space mode and separated physical-space mode. Also playing with others or online creates an ability to relate to others and parallel competition in separated space is more enjoyable, more physically exerting and creates higher future play motivation.\n\nChildren cope differently depending on how they were raised, this also applies to how they cope with unfamiliar beings in their lives. Jens B. Asendorpf refers to parallel play as a child's coping style, and explains that children who want to play with an unfamiliar peer will resort to this style. This coping style allows children to engage in the same activities as their peers from afar, until they are comfortable enough to socialize with their peers \n"}

It is a small corps, forming part of the Army Medical Services.\n\nThe original Army Veterinary Service (Veterinary Corps) within the Army Medical Department was founded in 1796 after public outrage concerning the death of Army horses. John Shipp was the first veterinary surgeon to be commissioned into the British Army when he joined the 11th Light Dragoons on 25 June 1796.\n\nThe Honorary Colonel-in-Chief is the Princess Royal who has visited RAVC dog-handling units serving in Afghanistan.\n\nIn late March 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that Fitz Wygram House, one of the Corps' sites, was one of ten that would be sold in order to reduce the size of the Defence estate.\n\nThe RAVC provides, trains and cares for mainly dogs and horses, but also tends to the various regimental mascots in the army, which range from goats to an antelope. Personnel include veterinary surgeons and veterinary technicians providing medical and surgical care to animals, and handlers who train dogs and deploy with them on operational service. Dogs are used extensively in the theatre of war, and are organised within the 1st Military Working Dog Regiment (see below). Horses are used primarily for ceremonial purposes, although the Corps continues to rehearse procedures for the operational deployment of horses. This is explained on its website in these terms: Although there is unlikely ever be a significantly large requirement for equines in future military operations, there are scenarios where ground conditions, (in situations where stealth is required or helicopters are not available for example), could make pack transport a vital solution to the need.\n\nThe main location for the RAVC is at Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, although staff are spread throughout the Army.

PopCrunch ranked Jack ninth on their list of the best AI characters in video games.\n\nGamesRadar mentioned him in the \"Robots that don't make any sense\" article, questioning \"Another Jack? Is that a popular robot name?\". In GamesRadar article for \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", they stated \"Jack-X seems to be one of the newest models in the series, the buff robot sometimes works for the Mishimas, other times he competes to learn something about himself.\" \"Complex\" compared Jack and Yoshimitsu to Seth and Cycloid-Y from the \"Street Fighter\" series, predicting the former two would win in a fight. In 2012, \"Complex\" also listed Prototype Jack as the 15th coolest robot in video games. Gaming Target listed Jack as the ninth best \"Tekken\" character. GameSpy named Jack as one of the \"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\" in video gaming, commenting \"Featuring massive metal arms that are as big as its entire body, Jack simply and unemotionally crushes the competition.\"\n\n\"PlayStation Official Magazine\" listed Jack as one of \"The best PlayStation robots,\" stating, \"the reason we like Jack, all the Jacks, is their simplicity. They are massive and can batter people around the face with swooping mechanized doom fists\".\n"}

The station originally comprised a single covered passenger platform with three lines of rails, one for arrivals, one for departures and a spare line for carriages.\n\nIn 1857 the railway company erected a clock in front of the station facing Academy Street. This clock by Bryson & Sons, Princes Street, Edinburgh, was illuminated at night.\n\nIn 1865 the station was enlarged. The platform was lengthened to and a shed added which was long, wide and high. There were double lines for north and south traffic.\n\nThe platforms were extended again to and the platform roofs were extended in 1876 by Murdoch Paterson. The station platforms were lit by electricity for the first time in 1908.\n\nIn 1933, as part of an internal reorganization, the London and North Eastern Railway closed their offices at the station and the staff relocated to Aberdeen.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1968 under British Rail the station buildings were replaced, the new design by Thomas Munro and Company.\n\nIt is now the terminus of the Highland Main Line, the Aberdeen–Inverness line (of which the Inverness and Nairn Railway is now a part), the Kyle of Lochalsh line and the Far North Line.\n\nA revamp by Mott Macdonald of the station's frontage, forecourt and concourse is planned to be completed by 2018.\n\nInverness is owned by Network Rail. However, it is operated by Abellio ScotRail who run most of the services using the station. Caledonian Sleeper and London North Eastern Railway run the only non-ScotRail services.\n\nThe station itself sits at one apex of a triangular junction in the centre of Inverness, with each half of the station connected to one line. The Highland Main and Aberdeen Lines both approach the station from the east and use Platforms 1–4, while the Far North Line (which also carries traffic heading for the Kyle Line) approach from the north-west and use Platforms 5–7. Platform 5 also has a connection from the east side, but it is only usable by a two car train, and even then, it must not be in passenger service and movements \"from\" Platform 5 to the east line are not allowed. Platform 1 is long enough for a 13-coach train; platform 2 can hold 15 coaches; platforms 3 and 4, eight each; and platforms 5–7 will accommodate five coaches each.\n\nThe third chord runs between \"Rose Street Junction\" on the Far North Line and \"Welsh's Bridge Junction\" on the Aberdeen/Perth line. The Aberdeen and Perth lines diverge at \"Millburn Junction\" a short distance beyond Welsh's Bridge. Platforms 1–4 are from (measured via ); Millburn Junction, from Perth, is also from Perth (measured via ). The station is the zero point for the Far North Line, and platforms 5–7 are along this line; Rose Street Junction, along the Far North Line, is from Perth. Signalling for the entire area is controlled from a panel box near the station built in 1988. This supervises the station area & approaches and also houses the Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) control desk that monitors the full length of the Kyle & Far North lines. RETB was installed by British Rail.\n\nPlatform destination LED screens are installed, along with a main departures and arrivals information board. Each of Platforms 1-7 has its own screen showing departures from that platform. Screens are also present behind the wall for all platforms from 3-6. In addition, several other screens are also visible for general information.\n\nAs of 2020, Inverness has the following Monday–Saturday services:\n\nOn Sundays a reduced service operates on all routes, this being:\n\nFrom 2018, this station will be one of those to benefit from a package of timetable enhancements to be introduced by Transport Scotland and Scotrail. The current Perth to Inverness timetable will be increased to hourly each way, with trains south of there running on alternate hours to Edinburgh & Glasgow. Journey times will be reduced by 10 minutes to both cities. The service to Nairn, Forres & Elgin will also be enhanced to hourly and some Aberdeen trains extended through to Dundee and beyond.\n\nThe main coach and bus station is located in Margaret Street, 150 m northwest of and just around the corner from the railway station. Many services can also be joined at the stop on Millburn Road outside Marks and Spencer, closer to the station.\n\nAside from local buses, there are also long-distance coach services which allow rail passengers to continue their journey to areas of the Highlands not on the rail network:\n\nStagecoach North Scotland route 11 runs every 30 minutes between Inverness city centre and Inverness Airport. The bus leaves from Strothers Lane, just around the corner from the station. Journey time to the airport is 25 minutes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2303576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303576", "title": "Kuma and Panda", "text": "Kuma and Panda\n\n, literally meaning \"bear\", is the name of two characters within the \"Tekken\" fighting game series released by Namco Bandai Games. Kuma I was introduced in the first \"Tekken\" and returned for \"Tekken 2\", while Kuma II was introduced in \"Tekken 3\" and has returned for all subsequent games. Both of them are tame bears, bodyguards to Heihachi Mishima, as well as father and son towards each other. The female was introduced in \"Tekken 3\" as a palette swap of Kuma, returning for subsequent games.\n\nThe first Kuma was once an abandoned cub in the forests of the Mishima estate. Heihachi Mishima found Kuma and took him in as his pet. When Kuma reached adulthood, Heihachi built him an outhouse to cater for his impressively large frame. Heihachi taught the bear simple commands and hand signals, which Kuma picked up at an alarming speed. Kuma was even taught rudimentary Japanese. After two years, Heihachi realized the power contained in Kuma, and so he trained Kuma in the arts of Kuma Shinken. None of Heihachi's associates could understand why Kuma was so intelligent, which led to a lot of them fleeing the estate in fear of the bear's intellect. This was further reinforced by Kuma's penchant for the taste of human flesh. Despite Kuma's unflinching loyalty to his master, Kuma liked to leave the side of Heihachi to sleep, even during the summer. This lazy approach means that Kuma's fighting style has never really matured and is very disjointed. This was demonstrated in The King of Iron Fist Tournament, where Kuma was easily defeated by Paul Phoenix. Kuma was very impressed with Paul's fighting prowess, as he thought that the only strong human was Heihachi. Heihachi was defeated in the last tournament by Kazuya Mishima, and so the two retreated into a mountain dojo to re-train. Kuma traveled to the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 with his master, vowing to destroy Paul Phoenix this time. If anyone gets in his way, he would eat them. He was defeated by Paul again.\n\nDuring Kuma's travels with Heihachi, Kuma died of old age. Before he died, he had a cub, which was also named Kuma by Heihachi, perhaps in homage of beloved first pet. Eventually, Kuma II became Heihachi's pet, and Heihachi trained him in Kuma Shinken, as he did Kuma II's father years ago. Kuma II is more intelligent than his father, but is also lazier. One day, while he was immersed in a television show, Kuma suddenly went wild at the sight of a martial artist with a scarlet go-gi. The fighter was the original Kuma's old rival, Paul Phoenix. Since that day, Kuma trained intensely in order to defeat Paul in battle. Not interested in defeating Ogre, the fighting God, Kuma enters The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 with the sole intention of defeating Paul Phoenix. During the previous tournament, Kuma lost to Paul Phoenix. Kuma realized that he had lost touch with his animal roots, and that as long as he remained Heihachi's pet, he would be restricted in harnessing the power of his natural power and instincts. Determined to revive his animal instincts, Kuma began training in the mountains of Hokkaido, and for the first time in his life, he trained alone, without Heihachi. While training, Kuma found life in the wilderness more intense than anything Kuma went through with Heihachi. Despite this, Kuma continued his training, and felt his skills improving, and even developing his own attacks. Although he had made some massive strides in his life to revive his animal instincts, Kuma kept one quirk - he could not live without television. He would frequently go down to nearby villages to watch TV through the windows of the villagers' houses. One day, Kuma went down to the villages to watch some TV, as per usual, but when he looked through the window of one house, he saw a commercial announcing The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. With his animal instincts raging, Kuma headed to the tournament, once again, with the sole intention of defeating Paul Phoenix. Kuma finally defeated Paul in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. However, his master Heihachi was dead. Kuma was alone without Heihachi. Then he realized the Mishima Zaibatsu was in trouble he knew what he must do. When Kuma reached headquarters, he heard someone was taken control and announced the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5. Kuma vows revenge to save the Zaibatsu for his master and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament, but he was defeated by Paul. After the death of his former master, Heihachi Mishima, Kuma believed no one but he could rescue the Mishima Financial Group (MFG) from its captor. Eager to do just that, Kuma confronted the MFG. However, the MFG's new CEO, Jin Kazama, was waiting. Kuma was easily beaten and discarded in the Hokkaidō wilderness. Though defeated, his fighting spirit was not lost and he found his former master Heihachi, whereas both reclaimed the MFG and Kuma is promoted as one of Tekken Force officer as of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 7. Kuma is also the one who inspired a Philippine fighter Josie Rizal when Kuma and his troops helps the victims of her country's Typhoon incident.\n\nKuma also appears in \"Tekken Card Challenge\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", \"\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" and \"Tekken Revolution\".\n\nKuma appears in Capcom-made crossover fighting game \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" with Heihachi Mishima as his official partner. His Swap Costume is modeled after R. Mika. According to the download blurb, Kuma has joined R. Mika's wrestling league. Apparently this was the only costume that could fit him. Kuma appears as a support character in \"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale\". He is summoned by Heihachi Mishima's level 2 Super, where he runs around the stage slashing at fighters with his claws, pounds the ground and despawns. He also appears as a minion, and can be unlocked by reaching rank 8 with Heihachi. Kuma also appears in \"Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory\" and its remake as a NPC that appears on some of the events of the DLC character, Tekken. Kuma however never uses actual bear sounds in his appearance in \"Victory\", but is rather voiced by Tekken director, Katsuhiro Harada. He was described as Tekken's sparring partner and close friend.\n\nKuma I made a cameo in \"\", climbing down a tree. Kuma appears in comics \"Tekken Saga\" (1997), \"Tekken 2\" (1998) and \"Tekken Forever\" (2003). A picture of Kuma II is briefly seen in the CGI film \"\", when Anna Williams recruits Ling Xiaoyu at Mishima Polytechnic School.\n\nIn \"Tekken\", Kuma I was represented as a sun bear; however in \"Tekken 2\", Kuma is either a grizzly bear or a polar bear, depending on which costume is used. Kuma II is always depicted as a large, grizzly bear with brown fur. He almost always wears a red scarf and red spiked wristband on the left hand. In \"Tekken 4\", however, he wears red T-shirt with a design on the back and red-white paw rubber shoes. Later, he also gains red spiked anklet on the left leg instead of red wristband.\n\nKuma fights using an \"original\" fighting style called Kuma Shinken, a move set closely resembling Mishima family's style of karate. In the earlier games, Kuma Shinken took many elements from the Jack models' fighting style. However, in later games, the art started to gain some originality with unique strikes and even a \"hunting\" mode which puts Kuma on all fours for more attacks. This fighting style is considered one of the most unusual, as it does not rely on straight attacks, but instead uses tricks such as rolls, dodges, and various other stances. Because of this, Kuma is one of the hardest characters to master, as he is quite slow and not very flexible. Kuma also has move where he turns around, stands on all fours, relaxes, and then farts, which would instant kill the opponent.\n\nGameSpy named Kuma as one of the \"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\" in video gaming, commenting \"This one is simple – Kuma is a bear. An actual bear. A wild animal.\" UGO Networks listed Kuma as one of \"The 50 Cutest Video Game Characters\", adding \"It’s always adorable when bears try to do human things\". 1UP.com listed Kuma as one of the characters they wanted to see in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", stating \"you can't have \"Tekken\" in the title without some sort of animal that is ready for a throwdown\". In a GamesRadar article, a fight between Kuma and Zangief was written as one of the ones players wanted to see in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", commenting \"In what will certainly be the most anticipated and, bizarrely, logical of these match ups, The Red Cyclone will finally be able to prove himself against his eternal arch nemesis, a bear.\" \"FHM\" listed Kuma and Zangief as one of the \"10 Awesome Fantasy Fights in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", adding \"Dude’s strong enough to take on bears, but Kuma here is no ordinary bear.\" \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" ranked Kuma as the seventh best tag team finisher in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", suggesting to \"team the hairy great brute up with Kuro for the ultimate little-and-large comedy double act.\" In 2012, \"Complex\" named Kuma's spinning backwards and his proposal to Panda as one of the \"15 craziest moments in the Tekken series\". Complex also ranked Kuma's denied proposal to Panda in the \"Tekken 3\" ending as the \"23rd funniest moment in video games, commenting \"We cried laughing watching this ending. And we still cry. It's really that amazing.\" 4thletter placed Kuma's (alongside Heihachi's) \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" and \"Tekken 4\" endings at 200th and 76th places, respectively in their list \"Top 200 Fighting Game Endings\". WhatCulture named Kuma as one of the \"10 major characters that may not be returning to \"Tekken 7\"\", commenting \"Tekken 7 is already proving to be a much darker game judging from trailers, akin in feel to Tekken 4. Kuma’s light heartedness may be out of place.\" Peter Austin from WhatCulture named Kuma the \"9th Greatest Tekken Character of All Time\".\n\nPanda is the pet of Ling Xiaoyu in the games since \"Tekken 3\". Kuma is in love with Panda, but she is not interested in him romantically. Panda is cared for at Ling Xiaoyu's high school. To participate in the tournament, Ling moved to the Mishima Industrial College in Japan. Heihachi taught Panda advanced bear fighting so that she could act as a bodyguard for Xiaoyu throughout the series.\n\nPanda also appears in \"Tekken Card Challenge\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", \"\" and \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\". She is briefly seen in Xiaoyu's \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" promotional art where she is seen on the roof of what appears to be Mishima Polytechnic. In the same game, Chun-Li's Swap Costume is based on Panda's appearance. Panda appears in the CGI film \"\", as a supporting character, voiced by Taketora, who also voices Akuma in \"Street Fighter\".\n\nPanda is, as her name implies, always depicted as a giant panda with pink or orange glowing bands and a green holster wrapped around her shoulder. The holster has grass inside of it. Since her introduction, she has always been a palette swap of Kuma, and thus has the same move set as him. In \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", she is separated from Kuma and is given her own slot, even though she still has the same move set as Kuma's. They have the same moves, stance, and animations (shown before and after a fight), but their endings are always, in some way, different. Their animations (shown before and after a fight) are however differentiated in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", then followed by \"Tekken 7\" where their movesets are identical except for their Rage Arts.\n"}

Branded on-air as Telemundo 2 KASA, the station is owned by Ramar Communications. KASA-TV's studios are located on Broadcast Plaza in Albuquerque, and its transmitter is located on Sandia Crest. \n\nA sale to Ramar Communications was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017 as part of the merger between Media General, the station's previous owner, and Nexstar Broadcasting Group. Ramar moved the Telemundo affiliation from the low-power KTEL-CD to KASA on January 18, becoming a Spanish-language station in the process.\n\nIn addition to the main KASA signal, there are 41 low-powered repeaters that carry its programming throughout New Mexico and parts of Colorado.\n\nChannel 2 came to the air on October 31, 1983 as KSAF-TV, a locally owned general entertainment independent station. The station initially ran old movies, westerns, drama shows, and religious programming. On March 1, 1985, channel 2 became known as KNMZ-TV and began running cartoons, old sitcoms and other shows that had previously aired on KNAT-TV (channel 23), which had recently gone dark (it returned the next year as a TBN affiliate).\n\nKNMZ-TV was sold the next year to New Mexico Media Limited License Holdings, then in late 1987 to Las Vegas-based Sunbelt Communications Company. The deal closed in early 1988 and the format stayed the same, then on September 4, 1989 the station changed call letters to KKTO-TV. Shortly afterwards, the station began to suffer financial problems, and by 1991, channel 2 was running an all-barter lineup of a few classic sitcoms and first run cartoons as well as low budget movie packages.\n\nThe intellectual unit that would eventually be associated with KASA-TV began as KGSW on May 8, 1981 on channel 14. It was the state's second English-language general entertainment station. The callsign was derived from the station's original owners, Galaxy Communications and Southwest Television. Initially, the station carried drama shows, movies from the 1940s through the 1970s, sitcoms, and religious shows. In the fall of 1983, KGSW added more sitcoms and began running cartoons in the 7-9 a.m. and the 3-5 p.m. weekday slots.\n\nKGSW was managed by Erik Steffens. Its first programming director was legendary network sports producer Don McGuire, a native of Albuquerque. McGuire attained rights to UNM Lobo football and hired Connie Alexander and Gary Ness as announcers.\n\nIn 1984, the Providence Journal Company bought KGSW from the original owners. The station affiliated with the Fox network when the network launched on October 9, 1986. The station continued a general entertainment format with cartoons, sitcoms and movies well into the 1990s.\n\nIn the fall of 1992, after being unable to turn a profit as an independent station and to focus on its profitable NBC affiliates in Nevada, Sunbelt took KKTO-TV dark, with the station's strongest programming (including \"The Disney Afternoon\") moving to KGSW-TV. Later that fall, the channel 2 license was sold to the Providence Journal Company, which moved the KGSW intellectual unit to channel 2 and surrendered its old channel 14 license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on April 5, 1993. (Channel 14 is now occupied by KLUZ-TV, a Univision affiliate.) Two months earlier, on February 2, 1993, the station's call letters were changed to KASA-TV, based on the Spanish word \"casa\" (\"home\"). The move to the stronger channel 2 ushered in a new era for the station. With an over-the-air signal comparable to KOB-TV, KOAT-TV, and KRQE and Fox coming into its own as a network, KASA became more competitive in New Mexico than ever before.\n\nThe station signed on from Peralta Ridge near Jemez Springs, New Mexico, north of Albuquerque and about equidistant between it and Santa Fe. The power was 100 kilowatts and the height above average terrain was in excess of (near the class maximum of 1,960'). The station signed on with a Larcan transmitter and a circularly polarized antenna, giving the station (at least theoretically) the best chance for success. In practice, however, the site was too far from viewers, too low in the sky, obstructed somewhat by terrain, and lacking in fresnel clearance. One factor in the station's later success was that the transmitter was relocated to the Sandia Crest site used by most other area stations.\n\n\"KASA Fox 2\" began evolving its programming. Daytime sitcoms were gradually replaced with talk and reality shows, though sitcoms still air in the evenings (many of the shows that would have been on KASA over a decade ago are now on KWBQ and KASY). A.H. Belo bought the Providence Journal Company, including KASA, in 1997. Later, in 1999, Raycom Media bought KASA, along with KHNL in Honolulu, Hawaii. The station phased out cartoons as Fox ended its weekday children's block in 2002.\n\nAfter Raycom purchased the Liberty Corporation in August 2005, Raycom announced its intent to sell KASA and several other stations (most of which went to Barrington Broadcasting with one going to Quincy Newspapers). On July 27, 2006, Raycom announced that LIN TV, owner of CBS affiliate KRQE, was purchasing KASA for $55 million . LIN TV took over operation of KASA on September 15, 2006 under a local marketing agreement, and LIN TV officially completed the purchase on February 22, 2007. In most markets, a duopoly between two \"Big Four\" stations wouldn't have been allowed under the FCC's duopoly rules, which forbid one person from owning two of the four largest stations in a single market However, the FCC allowed LIN TV to buy KASA since channel 2 was New Mexico's fifth-rated station at the time. At the time, KASA was the third-largest (or fourth-largest, if one includes WTTE in Columbus, Ohio, operated and effectively owned by the owner of that city's WSYX, Sinclair Broadcast Group) Fox affiliate owned in a duopoly with a \"Big Three\" station—and the second-largest such duopoly that is owned by LIN TV.\n\nEven though KASA redesigned its logo shortly after LIN took over, its old WorldNow-powered website continued to use the Raycom era format until it was shut down on July 20, 2007 and replaced with a redirect to KASA's then-new website which, like the websites of the other LIN-owned Fox affiliates, used Fox Interactive's MyFox interface. However, in late 2008, the Web site address reverted to kasa.com (with myfoxnewmexico.com serving as a redirect), using a new interface jointly developed by LIN and Fox Interactive (now the EndPlay CMS platform).\n\nOn May 18, 2007, LIN TV announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could result in the sale of the company. On March 21, 2014, it was announced that Media General would acquire LIN. The merger was completed on December 19.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. KASA and KRQE were slated to become part of \"Nexstar Media Group.\" As KASA and KRQE were both ranked among the top four stations in the market during the November 2015 sweeps, Nexstar elected to divest one of the two stations to comply with the FCC duopoly rules; on June 30, 2016, it agreed to sell KASA-TV to Ramar Communications, owner of Telemundo affiliate KTEL-CD (channel 15), Movies! affiliate KUPT-LD (channel 16), and MeTV affiliate KRTN-LD (channel 33), for $2.5 million. \n\nOn January 18, 2017, KASA switched to Telemundo, and converted its three existing full-power stations in the market—KRTN-TV (channel 33) in Durango, Colorado, KTEL-TV (channel 25) in Carlsbad, and KUPT (channel 29) in Hobbs—into satellites of KASA; it did not acquire KASA's Fox affiliation, which moved to KRQE's second digital subchannel.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn October 27, 2010, KASA added TheCoolTV on DT2. It also carried another music video channel called The Tube from 2005 until LIN TV took over in 2007 (the network ended later that year). No programming had aired on DT2 since then. On March 1, 2013 KASA dropped TheCoolTV. KASA was once again airing only one digital stream for over two years. On June 1, 2015 KASA added Cozi TV, a digital network from NBC Universal that airs mainly reruns of classic TV series. On November 30, 2015, KASA added Ion Television as a third digital subchannel. Ion features mostly reruns of contemporary crime-drama programs as well as movies.\n\nAs part of Ramar Communications' planned acquisition of the station, it disclosed that it would carry MeTV on KASA's second digital subchannel and Heroes and Icons on the station's third subchannel. Cozi TV moved over to KASY-TV 50.4 while Ion moved to KWBQ 19.4.\n\nSince Ramar took over KASA, the station was in the process of mapping its subchannels to different channel numbers matching one if its satellites across the state as well as the channels it is shown on DirecTV and Dish Network. On February 1, 2017, MeTV was re-mapped to channel 15.1 which is also the channel position of KTEL-CD the former position of Telemundo prior to moving to KASA. H&I is now shown as channel 29.1 the channel position of KUPT-TV in Hobbs, New Mexico where it is also shown statewide on DirecTV and Dish Network on channel 29. Movies! is now shown as Channel 33.1 the former channel position of MeTV and also the channel position of KRTN-TV in Durango, Colorado which is also shown statewide on DirecTV and Dish on channel 33. Telemundo returned to KTEL-CD 15.3 while MeTV returned to KRTN-LD 39.1 (which moved from 33.1), making MeTV and Movies! exclusively to 15.1 (occupying the simulcast of KTEL-CD, which moved to CD3 and returned to Telemundo) and 33.1 (occupying the former channel position, KRTN-LD, which moved to 39.1), respectively.\n\nKASA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.\n\nThe station airs newscasts at 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays, and at 10 p.m. on weekends. These newscasts originate from the studios of Ramar flagship station KJTV-TV in Lubbock, Texas with reports from Albuquerque-based reporters.\n\nDebuting on September 16, 2006, KASA aired a one-hour nightly newscast produced by sister station KRQE. Originally titled \"News 13 on Fox 2\", the newscast was renamed \"KRQE News 13 at 9\" on August 8, 2010, the same evening KRQE began broadcasting all newscasts in true high definition. During KASA newscasts, and in cases of breaking news, KASA carried Fox News coverage, as it was a Fox affiliate, rather than the CBS News coverage used by KRQE, a CBS affiliate. Prior to September 16, 2006, KOB-TV produced the newscast, titled \"Fox 2 News at Nine\", for five years.\n\nKASA featured a morning news program simulcast with KRQE from 4:30 to 7 a.m. and aired local news from 7 to 9 a.m. when KRQE aired \"CBS This Morning\".\n\nBoth KRQE-produced newscasts moved to KRQE's 13.2 subchannel along with the Fox affiliation in 2017.\n\nSince late 2010, KASA has produced the local lifestyle program originally titled \"New Mexico Style\" hosted by Nikki Stanzione. In 2014, the show was renamed \"2 KASA Style\". Airing from 9–10 a.m., the show covers topics such as food, fashion and local entertainment. The program, now titled \"New Mexico Living\" and hosted by Chad Brummett and Brittany Flowers, has since moved to KRQE's 13.2 subchannel.\n\nKASA extends its coverage throughout the entire state of New Mexico, plus parts of Colorado, using a network of translator television stations listed below.\n"}

The senior staff of Deep Space Nine grieve the loss of their crewmates, and Sisko informs O'Brien's wife Keiko of his death. \n\nMeanwhile, Bashir and O'Brien are stranded in an abandoned town on the planet's surface. O'Brien tries to repair a broken communications system in order to inform the T'Lani of the Kelleruns' apparent betrayal. Bashir discovers that O'Brien has been infected by the Harvester and, as O'Brien's condition begins to deteriorate, is forced to take over the repair effort.\n\nKeiko insists that the recording of the supposed accident has been falsified: the video shows O'Brien drinking coffee in the afternoon, something she is certain he would never do. Sisko and Lt. Dax travel in a runabout vessel to visit the site of the \"accident\", where Dax investigates O'Brien and Bashir's runabout and finds evidence that its logs have been altered. \n\nThe T'Lani and Kellerun ambassadors show up together at Bashir and O'Brien's hideout. They reveal that the attack on the science team was a joint endeavor meant to erase all knowledge that could potentially be used to make Harvesters, and prepare to execute Bashir and O'Brien. Sisko and Dax rescue them by transporting them to their runabout. The T'Lani and Kellerun demand their return and fire upon the runabout when Sisko refuses; but Sisko deceives them by escaping safely in the other runabout. \n\nAs Chief O'Brien recovers from the Harvester poisoning back on Deep Space Nine, Keiko is stunned to discover that he \"does\" drink coffee in the afternoon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2303605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303605", "title": "Ogre (Tekken)", "text": "Ogre (Tekken)\n\nOgre is believed to be a biological weapon abandoned on earth by an ancient alien race, while he is additionally worshipped by ancient Aztecs as the \"God of Fighting\". In \"Tekken 3\" (1997), Heihachi Mishima sends his personal army, the Tekken Force, to search a temple in central Mexico, but they are promptly obliterated by Ogre. Having witnessed his power firsthand, Heihachi seeks an opportunity to use him in hopes of creating the ultimate life form while staving off his own aging process, and therefore stages the third edition of the King of Iron Fist Tournament held throughout the \"Tekken\" series in order to draw Ogre out. In the meantime, Ogre kills King in combat, beats Baek Doo San into a yearlong coma, and supposedly kills Jin's mother Jun Kazama. Paul Phoenix defeats Ogre in the tournament, but he then quits the competition under the impression that he has won, when he had one last opponent remaining in Ogre's true form, True Ogre. Heihachi then collects blood samples and skin tissue from the creature in order to splice his genomes with his own, but the project is unsuccessful, as he is missing a key ingredient called the \"Devil Gene\", which the series protagonist Jin Kazama and his father Kazuya possess. In \"Tekken 5\" (2004), Ogre is playable in the \"Arcade History\" mode and is the final boss of the \"Devil Within\" minigame, where clones of him and Heihachi are defeated by Jin Kazama. \n\nOgre appears in the noncanonical games \"Tekken Card Challenge\" and \"Tekken Mobile\", and is playable in the spinoff titles \"Tekken Tag Tournament\" and in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", with a version of the character called Ancient Ogre exclusive to the console version of the latter as a download.\n\nOgre is the \"Tekken\" series' first main villain unrelated to the Mishima family. His first form resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with dark green skin and red glaring eyes. He adorns various types and pieces of old Aztec jewelry and a large golden helmet/crown with very long orange hair. He is also has a small round shield that is said to be the fabled Stone of the Sun, the Aztec calendar attached to his left arm. His True Ogre form differs greatly in appearance, resembling a gargoyle sporting large wings and horns with his neck enveloped in fur, and massive claws on his feet and left hand with the right composed of a series of writhing snakes. A swimsuit costume for True Ogre was included with pre-orders of \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\". In 2014, after a fan posted a still image from \"Tekken 3\" on Twitter showing a silhouetted Ogre holding a disembodied head, Harada repeatedly denied it was that of Jun Kazama.\n\nOgre does not have a specific fighting style, as it is borrowed from those of many different series characters. He achieves his \"True Ogre\" form after defeating and absorbing the soul of Heihachi Mishima.\n\nOgre makes a cameo appearance in the 2005 tactical role-playing game \"Namco x Capcom\" as a non-playable boss. Ogre is selectable in the 2012 crossover fighter \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", in which he serves as a final boss and is part of the storyline of the game's characters traveling to the Antarctic in pursuit of an artifact called \"Pandora's Box\".\n\nThe character appeared in several \"Tekken\"-related comic books published between 1997 and 2012. Bandai Namco released an Epoch Co. \"Tekken 3\" action figure of True Ogre in 1999.\n\nOgre was rated the 23rd-best \"Tekken\" character in 2017 by Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek: \"True Ogre has the overkill you’d want in a final boss, but the understated green statue of an Aztec warrior has its own ominous feel to it.\" However, he considered it \"for the best that he never became a recurring villain. \"Tekken 3\" was enough and it springboarded the Mishima bloodline feud into a new direction upon his death.\" Kevin Wong of \"Complex\" said of True Ogre in 2013: \"Heihachi + Ogre = Holy shit. When we first saw this beast in \"Tekken 3\", we were intimidated, and that was before he started breathing fire. Mountains of quarters were wasted on conquering this behemoth. In the first \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", True Ogre was the ultimate, broken partner, forming the backbone of nearly every team in every competition. Tom Goulter of \"GamesRadar\" said in 2012, \"Ogre's lack of a sombrero, a penchant for Salsa dancing, or any known connection to drug crime marks him as one of the more progressive Latino videogame characters in recent years.\"\n\nLucas Sullivan of \"GamesRadar\" included the \"Namco X Capcom\" roster among his \"15 most bizarre crossovers in gaming\" in 2012: \"The day that Captain Commando, Klonoa, Huitzil, and Ogre co-exist in the same game is a grand day indeed.\" In 2012, \"FHM\" listed Ogre and Akuma as one of the \"10 Awesome Fantasy Fights in Street Fighter X Tekken\". In 2013, \"Complex's\" Gus Turner ranked Ogre the nineteenth-\"Most Feared God in Video Games\": \"An Aztec deity, Ogre is the God of Fighting, which, obviously, makes him a pretty good fit for the \"Tekken\" series. Just take a look at him. What else needs to be said?\" In 2015, CDKeys rated him the sixth-best fighting game villain: \"True Ogre is a great visual, and helped players enjoy an epic conclusion to one of the PlayStation’s best fighting games.\" In Game Rant list \"Tekken: The 5 Best & 5 Worst Fighters Of All Time\", Ogre was ranked among the best: \"A recurring series villain, it’s not to be trifled with, boasting an unpredictable range of moves from characters from across the series.\" \"Computer and Video Games\" named Ogre one of \"\"Tekken 's\" worst ever characters\" in 2011, describing him as \"look[ing] more in-character on a Mardi Gras float passing out flower garlands than he does being hit in the face by Paul Phoenix\". In a 2012 fan poll held by Bandai Namco, Ogre was only the 47th-most requested out of 54 \"Tekken\" characters for inclusion in the unreleased crossover \"Tekken X Street Fighter\", receiving 1,994 (2.26%) of 88,280 votes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2303636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303636", "title": "KOAT-TV", "text": "KOAT-TV\n\nKOAT-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 7, is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States and also serving the state capital of Santa Fe. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications. KOAT-TV's studios are located on Carlisle Boulevard in Northeast Albuquerque, and its transmitter is located on Sandia Crest, northeast of Albuquerque.\n\nKOAT serves nearly the entire state of New Mexico with the exception of the Clovis–Portales area, which receives ABC programming from KVIH-TV in Clovis (a satellite of KVII-TV in Amarillo, Texas), and Las Cruces–Deming, which is in the El Paso television market and is served by KVIA-TV, the El Paso ABC affiliate.\n\nKOAT signed on the air on September 28, 1953, less than a week before KGGM-TV (channel 13, now KRQE). It was locally owned by Albert M. Cadwell & Walter Stiles. It first operated from studios located on Tulane Drive, just off Central Avenue in Southeast Albuquerque. The local owners sold the station to Alvarado Television (the owner of KVOA in Tucson, Arizona) in 1957, Upon sign on, the station acquired the ABC affiliation from KOB, channel 4 (which carried it as a secondary affiliation). It also carried programming from the DuMont Television Network, which went off the air in 1955. In 1962, Alvarado sold both stations to Steinman Stations, who owned WGAL-TV in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and later acquired WTEV (now WLNE-TV) in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The station moved its studios in the early 1960s to a new facility located on University Boulevard in Northeast Albuquerque. In 1982, KOAT opened a new state of the art facility on the intersection of Carlisle and Comanche in Northeast Albuquerque.\n\nSteinman sold both KOAT and KVOA to Pulitzer, the then-owner of KSD-TV (now KSDK) in St. Louis, in 1969. This made KOAT Pulitzer's second television station acquisition outside of its home city of St. Louis; the KOAT acquisition was consummated a year after Pulitzer closed on its purchase of KVOA. A decade later, the other two Steinman stations were sold to Pulitzer as well, reuniting them with KOAT (KVOA was spun off in 1972).\n\nIn 1998, Pulitzer sold its entire broadcasting division, including KOAT and WGAL, to Hearst-Argyle. In mid-2009 the Hearst Corporation, already majority owner of what was Hearst-Argyle Television, bought out all of the then-publicly traded shares and changed the broadcasting group's name to Hearst Television.\n\nKOAT uses a version of the Circle 7 logo used by many other ABC stations, both owned-and-operated stations and affiliates. The \"Circle 7\" logo has been used at KOAT since 1971 and the Action News title since 1974. The original Circle 7 logo was inside a square, much like the variation used for many years by sister station KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Currently, KOAT uses a regular Circle 7 logo for its news broadcasts, and a variation with the ABC logo (the same logo used by the ABC owned-and-operated stations which use virtual channel 7) for all other station promotions and identification.\n\nKOAT-TV had a radio counterpart on 1450 kHz, KOAT, which launched in 1946 and affiliated with ABC Radio, portending KOAT-TV's continuous ABC affiliation.. A KOAT radio remote appears frequently in the 1951 Billy Wilder film, \"Ace in the Hole\".. Pulitzer sold the radio station sometime in the early 1970s, and 1450 kHz in Albuquerque is now KRZY.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKOAT has carried the Spanish-language network Estrella TV on its second digital subchannel since it launched on September 14, 2009. On July 11, 2016, KOAT added the Justice Network featuring true crime and investigation programming and also providing alerts of local criminals who are wanted by police.\n\nKOAT-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 21 to VHF channel 7.\n\nKOAT-TV formerly operated three satellite stations, which rebroadcast its signal and added local content for other parts of the broadcast market:\n\nNotes:\n\nKOCT, formerly KAVE-TV and KVIO-TV, became part of the KOAT-TV operation in 1993 after previously serving as a satellite of El Paso, Texas, ABC affiliate KVIA-TV. The Carlsbad station began in 1956 as KAVE-TV, a CBS/NTA Film Network affiliate with studio and transmitter facilities on Church Street in Carlsbad. In 1966, when Roswell, New Mexico, station KBIM-TV became the CBS affiliate for southeastern New Mexico, KAVE became a satellite station of then-ABC affiliate KMOM-TV in Monahans, Texas (now NBC affiliate KWES-TV, Midland–Odessa, Texas) and then of KVIA-TV in El Paso in 1976.\n\nHearst-Argyle surrendered the license of KOFT to the FCC on November 13, 2007, though its license was not canceled until May 5, 2010. Hearst then informed the FCC on July 18, 2012, that it would discontinue the operations of KOCT and KOVT; their licenses were canceled on August 1. The move was made to eliminate the need to maintain the KOCT and KOVT public files in their respective cities due to FCC regulations which went into effect on that date; both stations were promptly replaced with KOAT translator stations on the same channels to continue providing service to both cities.\n\nIn addition, there are several low-powered repeaters that carry KOAT's programming throughout New Mexico, northeastern Arizona and southern Colorado, including the following:\n\n\nSyndicated programming on KOAT includes \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"Tamron Hall\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", and \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\". As a Hearst owned station, KOAT airs the national political show \"Matter of Fact\", hosted by Soledad O'Brien, on Sunday mornings after ABC's \"This Week\".\n\nKOAT airs the entire ABC schedule in pattern, with the exception of the weekend editions of \"Good Morning America\", which air two hours earlier than its recommended time for Mountain Time Zone affiliates.\n\nKOAT produces 34 hours of news programming each week, with just over five hours each weekday, and 4½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays. The station's newscasts, branded as \"Action 7 News\", have consistently won the ratings battles with competitors KOB and KRQE for over 40 years, although KRQE has narrowed the margin in the last 10 years. Much of the success is due to KOAT's news anchors, many who have stayed at the station for many years. Weather forecaster Howard Morgan worked at KOAT for 28 years before retiring in 1999. Current weather forecaster Joe Diaz has been with the station for over 30 years, with the exception of five years spent in El Paso.\n\nKOAT was one of six ABC affiliates and one of two Hearst-owned ABC stations to have an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast, along with WISN in Milwaukee; as well as KRGV in Weslaco, Texas, KSTP in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, KIFI in Idaho Falls, Idaho, WEAR in Pensacola, Florida, and former sister station KITV in Honolulu, Hawaii. KOAT announced that with the 10 p.m. newscast on January 14, 2019, it would return to 35 minutes. \n\nUpon its current ownership by Hearst (then Hearst-Argyle) in 1999, KOAT rolled out a new set and began using the then-current Hearst-Argyle mandated graphics and \"Image News\" theme music package around December of that year. Then in 2004, \"Image News\" was dropped in favor of Jerome Gilmer's \"Hearst-Argyle TV News Music Package\". Another new set was introduced in September 2008. Currently, KOAT doesn't produce its newscasts in high definition. However, on June 13, 2010, the station began airing its newscasts in widescreen standard definition. And around late August 2013, KOAT switched to Hearst TV's \"diagrid\" standardized graphics along with the \"Strive\" news music package.\n\nOn August 21, 2017, KOAT added an one-hour 4 p.m. weekday newscast, and on October 25 of the same year, a new set was introduced. On April 5, 2018, KOAT began using an updated version of Hearst's standardized graphics, which were first rolled out by sister station WESH in Orlando, Florida in January.\n\nAs of August 1, 2019, KOAT is now one of three remaining Hearst Television stations to have yet to produce newscasts in HD (New Orleans NBC affiliate WDSU and Louisville CBS affiliate WLKY are the others).\n\nOn August 26, 2019, KOAT began broadcasting \"Action 7 News Live At Nine\" on the 7.3 Justice Network digital channel. It is also available, as all newscasts are, on KOAT's website.\n\n"}
{"id": "2303647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303647", "title": "Argument in the alternative", "text": "Argument in the alternative\n\nOriginating in the legal profession, argument in the alternative is a strategy in which a lawyer advances several competing (and possibly mutually exclusive) arguments in order to pre-empt objections by his adversary, with the goal of showing that regardless of interpretation there is no reasonable conclusion other than the advocate's.\n\nBart Simpson's classic \"I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, you can't prove anything!\" could be considered a somewhat humorous example. In a more serious example, a lawyer might argue, not only that his client was elsewhere when a murder or other crime took place, but also that \"even if he had been on the scene\", he would have had no way of accessing the alleged murder weapon. In this way, the lawyer attacks several premises of the prosecution's argument at once. The secondary line of reasoning might be presented to persuade a sub-audience who would not otherwise agree with the primary argument.\n\nIn regards to contract law, arguing in the alternative is done where a dispute arises over the terms of a contract. In a particular case it may be best for the plaintiff to allege that a statement made was to become a term of the contract. However the circumstances of the case may be such that the plaintiff cannot be certain that the court will accept this argument. To allow for this possibility, all the plaintiff need do is to argue in the alternative that the statement was in fact a representation (which allows for remedies based on misrepresentation) or again in the alternative that the statement became a part of a collateral contract. \n\nOccasionally, such arguments can be confusing to some people, who perceive a self-contradiction. Generally speaking, this is a case of mistakenly thinking the argument claims \"both\" alternatives are true, when in reality it is claiming only that one or the other of them must be.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2303658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303658", "title": "KRQE", "text": "KRQE\n\nKRQE, virtual and VHF digital channel 13, is a dual CBS/Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States and also serving the state capital of Santa Fe. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, it is a sister station to Santa Fe-licensed CW affiliate KWBQ (channel 19) and Albuquerque-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate KASY-TV (channel 50) (both owned by Tamer Media with certain services provided by Nexstar through a shared services agreement [SSA]). The three stations share studios on Broadcast Plaza in Albuquerque (across the street from NBC affiliate KOB, channel 4); KRQE's transmitter is located on Sandia Crest, east of Albuquerque.\n\nChannel 13 began operation in October 1953 as KGGM-TV, owned by the Hebenstreit family's New Mexico Broadcasting Company along with KGGM radio (610 AM, now KNML). In the late 1960s, the Hebenstreits sold a minority share to Chicago's Harriscope Broadcasting, which at one point owned WSNS-TV in Chicago (among other stations). Many early Westerns were filmed, at least partially, at KGGM. The large studio that it used was renovated in 2000 into KRQE's \"Newsplex,\" a combination newsroom and news studio. KGGM talent Earnest \"Stretch\" Scherer, known as Captain Billy, came over to the station from KOB in the mid-1950s, and hosted a children's show called \"Captain Billy's Clubhouse\". The format was a kids' peanut gallery on bleachers holding about 50 seats with games and banter between cartoons, à la \"Bozo's Circus\". Captain Billy was a sea captain with a Dutch boy white haircut sticking out from under a sea Captain's hat and big brush moustache. In late October 1972, Scherer was shot in the station's lobby after a misunderstanding involving a jealous husband (Scherer, who was hosting the station's local segments of the \"Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon\", had apparently put his arm around a female volunteer on-air, making the woman's husband angry). Scherer died that December at a hospital.\n\nAmong many alumni at KGGM/KRQE is Ray Rayner, formerly a children's television personality at WGN-TV in Chicago; he \"retired\" to Albuquerque in 1980 and became the weather presenter for KGGM-TV's newscasts for five years in the early 1980s.\n\nAfter having sold off KGGM radio in 1973, the Hebenstreits sold 42 percent of KGGM-TV to Lee Enterprises in 1985. The New Mexico Broadcasting Company acquired semi-satellite KBIM-TV in Roswell, which had until that time operated independently as a CBS affiliate, for $5 million in 1989. The purchase created financial strains on the Hebenstreits, who opted to sell their remaining shares to Lee in 1991. Citing the station's perceived reputation as a perennial third-place news outlet, Lee changed the call letters—at Andrew Hebenstreit's suggestion—to KRQE on September 7, 1992. However, the name \"New Mexico Broadcasting Company\" continued on the station's license well into the 21st century.\n\nIn January 1995, KRQE became a secondary affiliate of both UPN and The WB, running their programming on weekend overnights. Both networks moved to KASY-TV (channel 50) when it signed on that October, with KRQE running KASY under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Ramar Communications. Ramar sold KASY to ACME Communications, owner of KWBQ, in 1999, and the LMA with KRQE was dissolved.\n\nLee would eventually exit broadcasting and sold KRQE, along with most of the rest of its group, to Emmis Communications in 2000. In 2005, Emmis, in its own exit from television, sold the station to LIN TV Corporation in a group deal that included its sister stations in Green Bay, Mobile–Pensacola, and Terre Haute. In 2006, LIN announced its purchase of Raycom Media-owned Fox affiliate KASA-TV, which KRQE took control of on September 15. LIN's acquisition of KASA was finalized on February 22, 2007. The acquisition earned LIN TV criticism from area newspapers for the resulting layoffs, as well as what the \"Albuquerque Objectivist\" newspaper in October 2006 referred to as the creation of a local \"news empire\" in KRQE.\n\nKBIM-TV (channel 10) in Roswell, New Mexico signed on in February 1966 as the CBS affiliate for Southeastern New Mexico, replacing former CBS affiliate KAVE-TV in Carlsbad, New Mexico, which became an ABC affiliate (eventually becoming KOCT, a satellite of rival KOAT-TV). KBIM became a KGGM/KRQE satellite in 1990. KREZ-TV, channel 6 in Durango, Colorado began operations September 15, 1963 as KJFL-TV, a free-standing local independent station owned by Jeter Telecasting; it went off the air March 2, 1964, and returned on September 9, 1965 as KREZ-TV, a satellite of CBS affiliate KREX-TV (channel 5) in Grand Junction, Colorado, operating as such for nearly 30 years (with many attempts at regional news along the way) before becoming a KRQE satellite in 1995. A deal to sell KREZ to Native American Broadcasting, LLC was reached in April 2011; upon the sale's completion, KREZ was to become a full-scale independent station (with plans for extensive local programming), and change its call letters to KSWZ-TV. However, , the sale has not been completed, and KREZ remains a KRQE satellite.\n\nFollowing the acquisitions of KBIM and KREZ, in the late 1990s, KRQE branded as \"CBS Southwest\" in hopes of positioning itself as a regional network. However, this went nowhere, largely because the other stations in the market have long branded themselves by their call letters (even after acquiring or starting their own satellite stations), and in 2000 the station changed its branding to \"KRQE News 13.\"\n\nOn May 18, 2007, LIN TV announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company.\n\nOn August 7, 2009, KRQE began offering Mobile TV using BlackBerry.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, it was announced that Media General would acquire LIN. The merger was completed on December 19. Just over a year later, on January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. After selling KASA to Ramar Communications, KRQE became part of \"Nexstar Media Group.\" The sale was completed on January 17, 2017.\n\nKRQE-DT2, branded on-air as Fox New Mexico, is the Fox-affiliated second digital subchannel of KRQE, broadcasting in 720p high definition on virtual and VHF channel 13.2.\n\nOn January 18, 2017, KRQE-DT2 took over the Fox network affiliation for the Albuquerque market. The subchannel's programming was transferred from Santa Fe-licensed KASA-TV (channel 2), which had been the market's Fox affiliate from 1993 until 2017; KASA, in turn, inherited the Fox affiliation from KGSW-TV (channel 14, now occupied by KTFQ-DT) after that station's owner, the Providence Journal Company), bought the channel 2 license in 1993 (KGSW had been affiliated with Fox since the network's launch in 1986). KASA was sold to Ramar Communications, which changed the station into a Telemundo affiliate.\n\nDebuting on September 16, 2006, Fox New Mexico (then on KASA) airs a one-hour nightly newscast produced by the main KRQE studios. Originally titled \"News 13 on Fox 2\", the newscast was renamed \"KRQE News 13 at 9\" on August 8, 2010, the same evening KRQE began broadcasting all newscasts in true high definition. During Fox New Mexico newscasts, and in cases of breaking news, Fox New Mexico carries Fox News coverage, as it is the Fox affiliate, rather than the CBS News coverage used by KRQE 13.1, the CBS affiliate. Prior to September 16, 2006, KOB-TV produced the newscast, titled \"Fox 2 News at Nine\", for five years.\n\nSince 2015, Fox New Mexico has featured a morning news program simulcast with KRQE 13.1 from 4:30 to 7 a.m. and airs local news from 7 to 9 a.m. when KRQE 13.1 airs \"CBS This Morning\".\n\nCurrently, Fox New Mexico airs seven hours of local news each weekday, including 4½ hours in the morning (4:30–9 a.m.), a one-hour 6 p.m. newscast, another hour at 9 p.m., and a 10:35 p.m. broadcast.\n\nSince late 2010, Fox New Mexico (then on KASA) has produced the local lifestyle program originally titled \"New Mexico Style\" hosted by Nikki Stanzione. In 2014, the show was renamed \"2 KASA Style\" and was hosted by Chad Brummett and Brittany Flowers. In fall 2016, the show was renamed \"New Mexico Living\" and added Carmelina Hart as a co-host. After her departure in 2017, Kristen Curry became co-host before her departure in July 2019. Alexa Romero was named permanent co-host with Brummett in August 2019. Airing from 9 to 10 a.m., it covers topics such as food, fashion and local entertainment, along with weather and breaking news. (The show immediately re-airs at 10 AM on KWBQ)\n\nSyndicated programming on Fox New Mexico includes \"The 700 Club\", \"Family Feud\", \"The People's Court\", \"\", \"Dish Nation\", \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\". The dual affiliation makes KRQE one of a handful of stations in the United States to carry National Football League coverage from both CBS Sports and Fox Sports, along with other properties each hold rights to such as the World Series and NCAA March Madness.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn February 2, 2016, KRQE added GetTV, a channel that features classic movies from the 1930s to 1960s from Sony Pictures Entertainment, as a subchannel. GetTV was previously shown locally on KUPT-LD channel 16.2 since Fall 2014. GetTV moved to KASY-TV channel 50.3 on January 14, 2017 to make way for Fox programming on January 18. On December 27, 2017, KRQE added Bounce TV on 13.3 as part of Nexstar's overall network deal with Katz Broadcasting that saw their networks spread throughout KRQE, KWBQ and KASY in the market.\n\nKRQE shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 16 to VHF channel 13.\n\nThese stations rebroadcast KRQE's signal and add local content for other parts of the broadcast market:\n\nNote:\n\nIn addition, there are several low-powered repeaters that carry KRQE's programming throughout New Mexico, including the following:\n\n\nOrdinarily, KRQE produces eight hours of local news on weekdays and four hours each weekend day that airs between KRQE and Fox New Mexico. The station and its newscasts identify themselves as \"KRQE News 13\".\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the station was long a distant third in the market in terms of local viewership from the 1970s through the 2000s. This was largely because its competitors, KOB-TV and KOAT-TV, were two of their networks' strongest affiliates. In contrast, most CBS affiliates serving large stretches of territory either dominate their markets or are solid runners-up. The station has experienced a resurgence in recent years, however, and now wages a spirited battle for the top spot in the market with KOAT and KOB. Since September 15, 2006, KRQE also produces an hour-long, 9 p.m. newscast for Fox New Mexico on 13.2. Fox New Mexico also airs a 10:35 p.m. newscast.\n\nKBIM-TV offered local newscasts at 5:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Monday thru Fridays. However, due to budget cuts the newscasts were canceled in December 2008; KBIM was southeast New Mexico's only source of local news with local news offices in Roswell, Carlsbad and Hobbs for many years. KREZ-TV's local newscasts from Durango were canceled several years earlier by KRQE, also due to budget cuts by the parent company, a move that also eliminated a primary local news source for the Four Corners Region.\n\nOn August 8, 2010, KRQE became the first and only station in New Mexico to broadcast their newscasts in true high definition (KRQE newscasts on Fox New Mexico are also in high definition). A new set and new graphics debuted on the first HD broadcast, and KRQE also switched to \"The CBS Enforcer Music Collection\" theme music package for the HD debut. In 2016, the station dropped \"The Enforcer\" package in favor of \"Locals Only\" by Stephen Arnold Music.\n\nOn October 24, 2018, KRQE debuted a new state of the art digital set, and also updated its logo, including a CBS logo at the bottom of their current logo.\n\n"}

In international law it commonly refers to land transferred by treaty. Ballentine's Law Dictionary defines cession as \"a surrender; a giving up; a relinquishment of jurisdiction by a board in favor of another agency.\" In contrast with annexation, where property is forcibly seized, cession is voluntary or at least apparently so.\n\nIn 1790, the U.S. states of Maryland and Virginia both ceded land to create the District of Columbia, as specified in the U.S. Constitution of the previous year. The Virginia portion was given back in 1847, a process known as \"retrocession\".\n\nFollowing the First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860), Hong Kong (Treaty of Nanking) and Kowloon (Convention of Peking) were ceded by the Qing dynasty government of China to the United Kingdom; and following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895.\n\nTerritory can also be ceded for payment, such as in the Louisiana Purchase and Alaska Purchase.\n\nThis is a yielding up, or release. France ceded Louisiana to the United States by the treaty of Paris, of April 30, 1803. Spain made a cession of East and West Florida by the treaty of February 22, 1819. Cessions have been severally made of a part of their territory by New York, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia.\n\nUnder the civil law system, cession is the equivalent of assignment, and therefore, is an act by which a personal claim is transferred from the assignor (the \"cedent\") to the assignee (the \"cessionary\"). Whereas real rights are transferred by delivery, personal rights are transferred by cession. Once the obligation of the debtor is transferred, the cessionary is entirely substituted. The original creditor (cedent) loses his right to claim and the new creditor (cessionary) gains that right.\n\nWhen an ecclesiastic is created bishop, or when a parson or rector takes another benefice without dispensation, the first benefice becomes void by a legal cession, or surrender.\n\nRetrocession is the return of something (e.g., land) that was ceded in general or, specifically:\n\nExamples:\n\nIn insurance, retrocessional arrangements generally are governed by a reinsurance or retrocessional agreement and the principles applicable to reinsurance also are applicable to retrocessional cover.\n\n"}

It was released in May 1975 and, like its direct predecessor, targeted the DEC PDP-11 family of minicomputers. It was superseded by Version 7 Unix in 1978/1979, although V6 systems remained in regular operation until at least 1985.\n\nAT&T Corporation licensed Version 5 Unix to educational institutions only, but licensed Version 6 also to commercial users for $20,000, and it remained the most widely used version into the 1980s. An enhanced V6 was the basis of the first ever commercially sold Unix version, INTERACTIVE's IS/1. Bell's own PWB/UNIX 1.0 was also based on V6, where earlier (unreleased) versions were based on V4 and V5. Whitesmiths produced and marketed a (binary-compatible) V6 clone under the name Idris.\n\nV6 Unix was released as a distribution including the full source code. Since source code was available and the license was not explicit enough to forbid it, V6 was taken up as a teaching tool, notably by the University of California, Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University and the University of New South Wales (UNSW).\n\nUC Berkeley distributed a set of add-on programs called the First Berkeley Software Distribution or 1BSD, which later became a complete operating system distribution.\n\nUNSW professor John Lions' famous \"Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition\" was an edited selection of the main parts of the kernel as implemented for a Digital PDP-11/40, and was the main source of kernel documentation for many early Unix developers. Due to license restrictions on later Unix versions, the book was mainly distributed by \"samizdat\" photo-copying.\n\nThe source code for the original V6 Unix was later made available as free software under a BSD License from the SCO Group.\n\nIn 1977, Richard Miller and Ross Nealon, working under the supervision of professor Juris Reinfelds at Wollongong University, completed a port of V6 Unix to the Interdata 7/32, thus proving the portability of Unix and its new systems programming language C in practice. Their \"Wollongong Interdata UNIX, Level 6\" also included utilities developed at Wollongong, and later releases had features of V7, notably its C compiler. Wollongong Unix was the first ever port to a platform other than the PDP series of computers, proving that portable operating systems were indeed feasible, and that C was the language in which to write them. In 1980, this version was licensed to The Wollongong Group in Palo Alto that published it as Edition 7.\n\nAround the same time, a Bell Labs port to the Interdata 8/32 was completed, but not externally released. The goal of this port was to improve the portability of Unix more generally, as well to produce a portable version of the C compiler. The resulting Portable C Compiler (PCC) was distributed with V7 and many later versions of Unix, and was used to produce the UNIX/32V port to the VAX.\n\nA third Unix portability project was completed at Princeton, N.J. in 1976–1977, where the Unix kernel was adapted to run as a guest operating on IBM's VM/370 virtualization environment. This version became the nucleus of Amdahl's first internal UNIX offering. (see Amdahl UTS)\n\nBell Labs developed several variants of V6, including the stripped-down MINI-UNIX for low-end PDP-11 models, LSI-UNIX or LSX for the LSI-11, and the real-time operating system UNIX/RT, which merged V6 Unix and the earlier MERT hypervisor.\n\nAfter AT&T decided the distribution by Bell Labs of a number of pre-V7 bug fixes would constitute support (disallowed by an antitrust settlement) a tape with the patchset was slipped to Lou Katz of USENIX, who distributed them.\n\nThe University of Sydney released the Australian Unix Share Accounting Method (AUSAM) in November 1979, a V6 variant with improved security and process accounting.\n\nIn the Eastern Bloc, clones of V6 Unix appeared for local-built PDP-11 clones (MNOS, later augmented for partial compatibility with BSD Unix) and for the Elektronika BK personal computer (BKUNIX, based on LSX).\n\nV6 was used for teaching at MIT in 2002 through 2006, and subsequently replaced by a simpler clone called xv6.\n\n\n"}

Dodge\n\nWilliam Earl Dodge Sr. (September 4, 1805 – February 9, 1883) was an American businessman, politician, and activist. He was referred to as one of the \"Merchant Princes\" of Wall Street in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Dodge saw slavery as an evil to be peaceably removed, but not to be interfered with where it existed. He was a Native American rights activist and served as the president of the National Temperance Society from 1865 to 1883. Dodge represented New York's 8th congressional district in the United States Congress for a portion of the 39th United States Congress in 1866-1867 and was a founding member of the YMCA of the USA.\n\nWilliam Earl Dodge was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the second son of David Low Dodge, founder of the New York Peace Society, and his wife Sarah Cleveland, the daughter of minister Aaron Cleveland. He married Melissa Phelps (1809–1903), a daughter of Anson Green Phelps and Olivia Egleston. The couple had seven sons. In 1833, Dodge and his father-in-law founded the trading firm Phelps, Dodge and Company. In 1908 they became one of Americas largest mining companies Phelps Dodge Corporation.\nDodge is the namesake of Dodge County, Georgia. A consortium of businessmen led by Dodge purchased large tracts of timberland in this area following the Civil War. The Dodge Land Company laid claim to over of land through questionable land deeds. The consortium's ownership of these lands led to land wars which resulted in nearly fifty years of court cases.\n\nDodge and his associates built the Macon and Brunswick Railroad, connecting Macon to what was then a remote area of the state. Dodge County was formed in 1870 and Eastman, the county seat, was established at the railroad's Station Number 13. Dodge visited the area only once, to dedicate a two-story courthouse that he donated to the county. Dodge's sons later administered the timber businesses in this area.\n\nDodge was active in the post-Civil War Indian reform movement. He joined Peter Cooper in organizing the privately funded United States Indian Commission in 1868 and helped institute Ulysses S. Grant's Peace Policy toward the Indians. In 1869, Dodge toured Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) and Kansas as a member of the government-sponsored Board of Indian Commissioners. He met and discussed U.S. Indian policy with representatives of the Cheyenne, Arapaho and Kiowa. Dodge lobbied for the prosecution of the U.S. cavalry commanders responsible for the 1870 Marias Massacre in Montana, which left 173 Blackfeet dead. Dodge unsuccessfully campaigned to establish a cabinet-level department for Indian Affairs. He also used his influence in Washington on behalf of Indian educational programs and the General Allotment Act of 1887. A monument to William E. Dodge stands on the North side of Bryant Park.\n\nDodge was a founding member of the Board of Trustees for the Syrian Protestant College, later renamed the American University of Beirut. As Treasurer, he laid the cornerstone of College Hall, the first building on the present campus in Ras Beirut, on December 7, 1871.\n\nHis eldest son, William Earl Dodge Jr., assumed control of the Phelps Dodge company after his death.\n\n"}
{"id": "2303667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303667", "title": "Mekhitarists", "text": "Mekhitarists\n\nThe Mekhitarists (, \"Mkhit'areanner\", also spelled Mechitarists) are a monastic order of the Armenian Catholic Church founded in 1717 by Abbot Mekhitar of Sebaste. They are best known for their series of scholarly publications of ancient Armenian versions of otherwise lost ancient Greek texts and their research on classical and modern Armenian language. They follow the Rule of Saint Benedict.\n\nThe congregation was long divided into two branches, with the respective motherhouses being in Venice and Vienna. In July 2000 they united to form one institute.\n\nTheir eponymous founder, Mekhitar of Sebaste, was born at Sebastia in Armenia, then part of the Ottoman Empire, in 1676. He entered a monastery, but was concerned about the level of culture and education in Armenia under Turkish rule at that period, and sought to do something about it. Contacts with Western missionaries led him to become interested in translating material from the West into Armenian and setting up a religious order to facilitate education.\n\nMekhitar set out for Rome in 1695 to make his ecclesiastical studies there, but he was compelled by illness to abandon the journey and return to Armenia. In 1696 he was ordained a priest and for four years worked among his people.\n\nIn 1700 Mekhitar went to Istanbul and began to gather disciples around him. Mechitar formally joined the Latin Church, and in 1701, with sixteen companions, he formed a religious order of which he became the superior. They encountered the opposition of other Armenians and were compelled to move to the Morea (Peloponnese), at that time Venetian territory, where they built a monastery in 1706. At its inception the order was seen as an attempted reform of Eastern monachism. Jesuit priest Filippo Bonanni wrote of the arrival of two Armenian monks, Elias Martyr and Joannes Simon, sent by Mechitar to Pope Clement XI to offer the most humble subjection of himself and convent (\"Ut ei se cum suis religiosis humillime subjiceret\"). At that time, there was no mention of the Rule of Saint Benedict. Pope Clement XI gave his approval to the order in 1712. The monks began a foundation in Modon with Mechitar as abbot.\n\nOn the outbreak of hostilities between the Turks and Venetians they migrated to Venice, and the island of San Lazzaro was given to them in 1717. This has remained the headquarters of the congregation to this date; Mechitar died there in 1749, leaving his order firmly established.\n\nThe order became very wealthy from gifts. The behaviour of the Abbot Melkhonian caused a group of monks to leave in disgust and elect their own abbot, first at Trieste and then in 1810 at Vienna. They also established a printing press. The work of printing of Armenian books was by this time of great financial importance and the Venetian Republic made considerable efforts to encourage their return, but in vain.\n\nIn 1810 all the other monastic institutions in Venice were abolished by Napoleon, but the Mekhitarists were exempted by name from the decree.\n\nLord Byron visited the monastery on 13 November 1816, a Wednesday. His companion John Cam Hobhouse left this account of the visit:\nByron and I then went in [a] gondola to [the] establishment of St Lazare. It was some time before we were let in – the brothers were at prayer, but when we walked into their church one of them bowed out and most courteously showed us about. Unfortunately the key to the library was not to be found – the keeper of it was out. We saw the neat galleries and little chambers of the fathers, with Armenian letters over them. Our conductor showed us a man’s dictionary of Armenian and Latin – told us there were about forty frati and eighteen pupils, some few from Armenia, but mostly Constantinople. One has been in London and talks English. The youths learn Latin, all of them, and some Greek – also German and French some – and all Italian – English will now be taught.\n\nThose who please of the pupils enter the order (they have revenues on the mainland). Zanetto said Napoleon despoiled them, but our conductor contradicted this, and said that he gave a decree from Paris saving this brotherhood from the fate of the other monasteries on account of their patriotic labours for their countrymen. We saw their press, where eight men are employed, when we saw them on an Armenian Testament. They are now on a translation of Rollin. Their average is four books a year. They are all for the use of the Armenian nation, and all printed, as our guide said, in the literal (literary/classical) Armenian. They are shipped for Constantinople, and there sold.\n\nThe dining-hall set out there looked like a Cambridge dining-hall – and the establishment is about 100 years old founded by one [Mechitar], whose picture is in the refectory. It did our hearts good to see the place. We are to return and see the library. They are all Catholics.\nWhile the Mekhitarists live under the Rule of Saint Benedict, they are considered their own religious order separate from the Benedictines, similar to the Cistercians, hence they are not considered a congregation within the Order of Saint Benedict.\n\nThe main abbeys are San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice and the Mekhitarist Monastery in Vienna. There is a large convent and college for lay students at Padua, the legacy of a pious Armenian who died at Madras. In the year 1846 another rich benefactor, Samuel Morin, founded a similar establishment at Paris. Other houses were established in Austria-Hungary, Russia, Persia and Turkey — fourteen in all, according to early 20th century statistics, with one hundred and fifty-two monks, the majority of whom are priests. While not large for an order hundreds of years old, its extension was necessarily restricted because of its exclusive devotion to persons and things Armenian.\n\nIn 1911 they had fifteen establishments in various places in Asia Minor and Europe with some 150 monks, all Armenians; they used the Armenian language and rite in the liturgy.\n\nAfter a novitiate of two years, monks take the usual religious vows, along with a fourth vow — \"to give obedience to the preceptor or master deputed by their superior to teach them the dogmas of the Catholic Faith\". Many of them vow themselves also to missionary work in Armenia, Persia and Turkey, where they live on alms and wear as a badge, beneath the tunic, a cross of red cloth, on which are certain letters signifying their desire to shed their blood for the Catholic faith. They promise on oath to work together in harmony so that they may the better win the schismatics back to God. They elect an abbot for life, who has the power to dismiss summarily any of his monks who should prove disorderly. They wear the beard, Oriental fashion, and have a black habit — tunic, cloak and hood. In an engraving, the Mekhitarists would be undistinguishable from a friar of the Order of St. Augustine, except for his beard.\n\nThe Mekhitarists at first followed the rule attributed to Saint Anthony, but when they settled in the West modifications from the Rule of Saint Benedict were introduced. The use of the Rule of Saint Benedict represented the introduction of Western monasticism into the East, where up to this time a monk had no duty or vocation but to fill his place in the monastery and save his soul in the cloister, having broken off all relations with the outside world and had no idea of performing any works other than his choir duties, prayers, fastings, and the monastic observance. Under the Rule of Saint Benedict, a monk would be expected to devote himself to some useful work and take some thought of his neighbour. This adoption of the rule was desired by Mechitar and his monks, having a desire to devote themselves to apostolic work among their schismatic brethren, to instruct their ignorance, excite their devotion and bring them back into the communion with the Catholic Church. At the same time, it also offered security against lapsing into the apathy and inactivity associated in the Eastern mind with the life of the cloister.\n\nMissionaries, writers and educationists, devoted to the service of their Armenian brethren wherever they might be found, such are these Benedictines of the Eastern Church. Their subjects usually enter the convent at an early age, eight or nine years old, receive in it their elementary schooling, spend about nine years in philosophical and theological study, at the canonical age of twenty-five, if sufficiently prepared, are ordained priests by their bishop-abbot, and are then employed by him in the various enterprises of the order. First, there is the work of the mission — not the conversion of the heathen, but priestly ministry to the Armenian communities settled in most of the commercial centres of Europe. With this is joined, where needed and possible, the apostolate of union with Rome. Next there is the education of the Armenian youth and, associated with this, the preparation and publication of good and useful Armenian literature.\n\nTheir work has been fourfold:\n\n\nMechitar is credited for the initiating the study of the Armenian writings of the fourth and fifth centuries, which has resulted in the development and adoption of a literary language, nearly as distinct from the vulgar tongue as Latin is from Italian. This provided modern Armenian with a literary connection to its ancient past and literature.\n\nMechitar, with his Armenian \"Imitation\" and \"Bible\", began that series of translations of great books, continued unceasingly during two centuries, and ranging from the early Fathers of the Church and the works of St. Thomas of Aquin (one of their first labors) to Homer and Virgil and the best known poets and historians of later days.\n\nArtist, Ariel Agemian, illustrated the \"Imitation\" and contributed several major portraits of Mekhitarist Monks and religious scenes. He is also known for documenting the Turkish Massacre from his own recollections.\n\nAt one period, in connexion with their Vienna house, there existed an association for the propagation of good books, which is said to have distributed nearly a million volumes, and printed and published six new works each year. To him also they owe the guidance of their first steps in exegesis — the branch of learning in which they have won most distinction — and the kindred studies of the Liturgy and the religious history of their country.\n\nAt San Lazzaro he founded the printing press from which the most notable of their productions have been issued, and commenced there the collection of Armenian manuscripts for which their library has become famous. To any but members of the order the history of the Mekhitarists has been uneventful, because of the quiet, untiring plodding along ancient, traditional paths, and the admirable fidelity to the spirit and ideals of their founder.\n\nPrincipally by means of the Mekhitarists' innumerable periodicals, pious manuals, Bibles, maps, engravings, dictionaries, histories, geographies and other contributions to educational and popular literature they have served Catholism among the Armenian nation.\n\nThe following are the most valuable of their contributions to the common cause of learning. Firstly the recovery, in ancient Armenian translations, of some lost works of the Fathers of the Church. Among them may be noted \"Letters (thirteen) of St. Ignatius of Antioch\" and a fuller and more authentic \"History of the Martyrdom of St. Ignatius\"; some works of St. Ephrem the Syrian, notably a sort of \"Harmony of the Gospels\" and a \"Commentary on the Epistles of St. Paul\"; an edition of Eusebius's \"Ecclesiastical History\". The publication of these works is due to the famous Mekhitarists Dom Pascal Aucher, who was assisted in the last of them by Cardinal Mai. Pascal Aucher (Harut'iwn Awgerian: 1774-1855) also became Lord Byron’s tutor in Armenian, and his \"spiritual pastor and master\". He translated Paradise Lost into Armenian (1824). To Aucher also we are indebted for a German translation of the \"Armenian Missal\" (Tübingen, 1845) and \"Dom Johannis philosophi Ozniensis Armeniorum Catholici (AD 718) Opera\" (Venice, 1534).\n\nTwo original historical works may also be noted: \"The History of Armenia\", by P. Michel Tschamtschenanz (1784–1786) and the \"Quadro della storia letteraria di Armenia\" by Mgr. Pl. Sukias Somal (Venice, 1829).\n\nAmongst their countrymen the influence of the monks has been not only directive in the way of holiness and true service to God and the Church, but creative of a wholesome national ambition and self-respect. Apostles of culture and progress, they may be said, with strict justice, to have preserved from degradation and neglect the language and literature of their country, and in so doing, have been the saviours of the Armenian race. Individually, the monks are distinguished by their linguistic accomplishments, and the Vienna establishment has attracted attention by the institution of a Literary Academy, which confers honorary membership without regard to race or religion.\n\n\n\n"}

Tweaks are any small modifications intended to improve a system.\n\nIn electronics, it is a synonym for \"trimming.\" Analog circuit boards often have small potentiometers or other components on them that are used to calibrate or adjust the board as a service procedure: the small insulated screwdriver used to turn them is often called a \"tweaker.\"\n\nThis use was echoed in the name of the product \"Tweek\", a popular but controversial audio product during the 1980s, which was claimed to improve the electrical characteristics of audio switch contacts.\n\nHardware tweaking is a process of modifying certain parts of a hardware such as changing the cables, cleaning the heads of a VHS player with a branded cleaning fluid or oiling the moving parts of an engine with the best possible oil.\n\nComputer hardware tweaking is an extension of hardware tweaking, specifically geared towards the components of a PC. They include: changing voltage and clock rates of processing units, modifying RAM unit timing, improving cooling systems to reduce chance of overheating, etc.\n\nTweaks specifically designed to allow a processor to operate at a higher clock speed than normal are known as overclocking.\n\nModifications of computer systems not aimed at increasing performance, such as quieter fans, external controls, and decorations such as lights or windows, are known as modding.\n\nSoftware tweaking is the process of improving the performance of an application or the quality of its output. There can be two ways of accomplishing this: manually (that is, if one is familiar with programming; though it may be irrelevant if the source of the application is closed, and there are no built-in means to adjust its performance) or using another piece of software specialized for that purpose. Tweaking of this kind generally increases usability, in terms of personal configuration preferences, rather than objective performance of the system overall).\n\nSome very precise applications need constant and thorough tweaking to stay up to date and deliver best possible results. One of the most obvious examples of such a fine tuning is LAME MP3 encoder, whose 3.9x branch is not only considered as the state-of-the-art MP3 encoder, but also continues to shape the boundaries of the MP3 codec and stay competitive with its successors.\n\n\n"}

Barnes & Noble acquired the Bookstop chain and, decades later, closed the story in 2009. The theater is now a Trader Joe's.\n\nMost restaurants in Upper Kirby are chain restaurants. Shilcutt said that the restaurants in Upper Kirby were one of the aspects of Upper Kirby that she liked, that \"there are some wonderful independent Houston restaurants in the mix, too\" and that \"while many of the restaurants are some variation on plain Jane American food [...] there's a good variety of ethnic restaurants for the adventurous.\"\n\nThe Islamic Society of Greater Houston (ISGH) has its headquarters in the Eastside Main Center in Upper Kirby.\n\nLamar High School, a public secondary school, and St. John's School, an independent K–12 school, are located in Upper Kirby.\n\nResidents in Upper Kirby are zoned to schools in the Houston Independent School District. Upper Kirby is divided between Trustee District V, represented by Dianne Johnson as of 2008, and Trustee District VII, represented by Harvin C. Moore as of 2008. Johnson will no longer serve as a board member after 2009.\n\nSeveral elementary schools, including Poe, River Oaks, and West University serve sections of Upper Kirby. Lanier Middle School and Pershing Middle School serve separate sections of Upper Kirby. Pin Oak Middle School is an option for Pershing-zoned residents. All of Upper Kirby is zoned to Lamar High School.\n\nThe community is served by the Adele B. Looscan Neighborhood Library of Houston Public Library. The current Looscan Branch building opened in September 2007. The former Americans with Disabilities Act non-compliant library, which was established in 1956, closed on August 27, 2005 and was demolished in February 2006.\n\nThe previous Looscan branch had around 61,000 visitors in the fiscal year 2005. The original plans for Looscan called for the library to get a $5.37 million renovation. An Upper Kirby group proposed a new site near the Upper Kirby YMCA. Around that period the group Friends for Neighborhood Libraries began raising funds. The replacement library, with a cost of $6.2 million, had twice the staff and two and one half times the size of the previous facility. Friends of Neighborhood Libraries had raised $1 million in four months, and around $2.5 million in total to help fund the new library; the group spent about $30,000 for the expenses.\nThe \"Jewish Herald-Voice\" has its offices in Upper Kirby.\n\nThe \"River Oaks Examiner\" is a local newspaper distributed in the community.\n\nThe \"Houston Chronicle\" is the area regional newspaper.\n\nKTRK-TV, the ABC News-owned news outlet for the Houston-area, is located in the neighborhood on Bissonnet Street.\n\n"}

It is an all-Arabic channel based in Doha, Qatar that broadcasts conferences and other events live without editing or commentary, using subtitles when translation is needed. The channel is also sometimes referred to as Al Jazeera Live, as \"Mubasher\" is an Arabic word for \"Live\" (as in live broadcast) and \"Al-‘Amma\" is Arabic for \"General\". The channel was formerly called just Al Jazeera Mubasher.\n\nAl Jazeera Mubasher Al-‘Amma is the first channel of its kind in the Arab world and is similar to the U.S. channel C-SPAN and UK channel BBC Parliament. The channel also has a live stream of its broadcast on its website.\n\nIn 2014, the channel underwent a graphics upgrade as part of Al Jazeera Media Networks graphics upgrade across the company.\n\nLaunched in April 2005, Al Jazeera Mubasher is the first Middle Eastern 24-hour live news and events channel. Acting as the eyes and ears of the Arab world, the channel is dedicated to giving viewers real-time footage of global and regional events.\n\nThe channel has remote feeds and on-the-ground cameras broadcasting political gatherings, press conferences, discussions, and meetings, bringing audiences the latest on political, social, cultural and economic affairs. When people want events as they happen, they turn to Al Jazeera Mubasher—live and uncut.\n\nOn December 20, 2014 it was announced that Al Jazeera Media Network would coalesce both Al Jazeera Mubasher and the temporarily suspended Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr in to a new combined channel called Al Jazeera Al-‘Amma (AJMG) or Al Jazeera Live General.\n\nThe new Al Jazeera Mubasher Al-‘Amma reports live events from all over the globe simultaneously with round-the-clock analysis. The channel’s focus is to ensure interaction between viewers and unfolding events. The channel is built to serve as an open space for viewers to air their views rather than them simply receiving information. The output rely much on viewer suggestions rather than a traditional pattern of fixed transmission grid.\n\nA similar channel called Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr (AJMM; ) similar to its original sister channel minus some commentary operated in Egypt based in Cairo from 2011 to 2014. The channel functioned similar to its main counterpart but was shut down by the Egyptian government after the removal of Mohamed Morsi due to its pro-Brotherhood slant. The channel's staff were arrested but later released.\n\nIn the period from 2013 until its suspension it broadcast from Al Jazeera's Doha headquarters running video brought in through other sources such as YouTube and Reuters and press conferences taped from other news organizations in the country.\n\nAl Jazeera Mubasher Misr has meanwhile temporarily ceased broadcasting until such time as necessary permits are issued for its return to Cairo in coordination with the Egyptian authorities. Al Jazeera Mubasher Al‘Amma is therefore transmitting on the frequencies of both Al Jazeera Mubasher and Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr.\n\n"}
{"id": "2303716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303716", "title": "Don's Party", "text": "Don's Party\n\nDon's Party is a 1971 play by David Williamson set during the 1969 Australian federal election. The film based on the play was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nDon Henderson is a schoolteacher living with his wife Kath and baby son in suburban Melbourne. On the night of the 1969 federal election Don invites a small group of friends to celebrate a predicted Australian Labor Party (ALP) election victory, much to the dismay of his wife. To the party come Mal, Don’s university mentor, and his bitter wife Jenny, sex-obsessed Cooley and his latest girlfriend, nineteen-year-old Susan, Evan, a dentist, and his beautiful artist wife Kerry. Somehow, two Liberal supporters, Simon and Jody also come.\n\nAs the party wears on it becomes clear that the Labor party, which is supported by Don and most of the guests, is not winning. As a result, alcohol consumption increases, and the sniping between Don and his male friends about their failed aspirations gets uglier, as does their behaviour toward the women. Mack, a design engineer whose wife has just left him, pulls out a nude photo of her for his friends' approval. Crass womaniser Cooley pursues the available women. The disillusioned wives exchange tales of their husbands' sub-par sexual performance. By the end of the night, Don and some of his friends have begun to grasp the emptiness of their compromised lives.\n\nThe play was adapted to a 1976 film by the playwright and directed by Bruce Beresford. John Hargreaves plays Don Henderson with Jeanie Drynan as Don's wife Kath. Ray Barrett plays Mal, Don's mentor, and Pat Bishop is his wife. Graham Kennedy plays Mack, Graeme Blundell is the repressed Australian Liberal Party supporter and Veronica Lang his obedient wife. Kerry (Candy Raymond) is the attractive and assertive artist and Evan (Kit Taylor) is her uptight and possessive partner. Cooley (Harold Hopkins) comes with his young girlfriend Susan (Clare Binney).\n\nIn the film the setting is relocated to the suburb of Westleigh in the northern suburbs of Sydney. The film also deviates from the stage version by increasing the level of profanity and contains full frontal nudity and sex scenes.\n\nPat Bishop won the AFI Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, Veronica Lang won the AFI Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Bruce Beresford won the Best Direction award, David Williamson won the Best screenplay award, and the film won the edit and sound award.\n\nThe video clip to You Am I's 1998 single \"What I Don't Know 'bout You\" is a tribute to 'Don's Party'. It features classic scenes from the movie re-enacted by noted Australian actors, including Stephen Curry, Ben Mendelsohn, Matt Day, Tania Lacy and Nadine Garner.\n\n\nIn 1973 Phillip Adams was approached to make the film by Jack Lee, who wanted to direct. At the time Adams felt that comedies were the only genre of film likely to redeem themselves financially in Australia, so he felt he would easily be able to raise finance for the movie, which he did not think would cost more than $300,000. However Adams was busy at the time working on the Australia Council, which held up his involvement for 12 months; at the end of that time, Australia was in the middle of a credit squeeze and he found it more difficult than he expected to get the money.\n\nProblems then emerged when the director Lee wanted to make the film into a broader comedy, which made Williamson uncomfortable and Adams was worried about raising finance with Lee attached, so Lee pulled out. Adams approached Ken Hannam but he lacked sympathy for the characters and found them too aggressive. Tim Burstall and Peter Weir were approached but they also turned down the film. Eventually Adams approached Bruce Beresford, who agreed.\n\nThere was some discussion that the events of the play be updated to the 1975 Federal election, but in the end it was decided to keep the screenplay faithful to the original play as it was widely believed in 1975 that Labor would lose–which was not the case in 1969. The setting was relocated to Sydney, in part because it was felt it would be cheaper but also to ensure audiences did not feel the movie was \"too Melbourne\". The budget was raised from the Australian Film Commission and private investors, mainly exhibitors.\n\nAdams wanted to cast Paul Hogan as Cooley but the actor declined. Ray Barrett had played that role in London but was considered too old to do it on film, and was given the part of Mal instead. He was changed from being an ex-student to a lecturer to allow for his age. Graeme Blundell took his role in order to escape typecasting as Alvin Purple. Barry Crocker was originally meant to play Don but was replaced by John Hargreaves.\n\nShooting began in January 1976 and took roughly five weeks, using a house in Westleigh as the main location.\n\nJohn Gorton played a cameo as himself as a tribute to his contribution in helping re-establish the Australian film industry.\n\nPhillip Adams originally distributed the film himself. \"Don's Party\" grossed $871,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $4,503,070 in 2009 dollars.\n\nWilliamson rated the film highly saying it was \"very well done\".\n\nIn 2010 Williamson wrote \"Don Parties On\", which opened the 2011 season of the Melbourne Theatre Company. Directed by Robyn Nevin, this sequel premiered on 13 January 2011 at the Arts Centre Playhouse.\n\n\"Don Parties On\" revisits many of the original characters as Don and Kath throw another party on the night of the 2010 Australian federal election. The relationships between the returning characters have changed, and there are also new characters: Cooley's wife Helen, Don and Kath's son Richard, Richard's lover Roberta, and his daughter Belle.\n\nWilliamson said he wrote the play for two reasons:\nOne was, what had happened to Don and his friends? The 20-somethings of Don’s Party were starting to ask themselves how their lives were going to pan out. Would their hopes and dreams be realised? Forty years later they know exactly how things have panned out – who has succeeded and who has failed and what criteria do you use to evaluate such questions in any case? Secondly, what has happened to Australia politically and socially in the intervening years? How has the landscape changed?\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Gold Coast Broadcasting and airs a rhythmic contemporary music format. KCAQ was simulcast on AM sister station KKZZ (1520 AM) in Port Hueneme until August 2019.\n\nThe station at 95.9 FM began broadcasting on August 15, 1972 as KEWE with an automated soft rock format. Five years later, the station changed its call sign to KGAB and flipped to an album-oriented rock format known as \"B96\". In 1982, KGAB adopted the call letters KZTR and an adult contemporary format known as \"K-Star\". The station flipped to classic rock in 1987 with the branding \"96ZTR\".\n\nIn September 1988, Gold Coast Communications Corp. sold KZTR and AM sister station KCZN to Golden Bear Broadcasting Inc. for $1,967,500. This amount is comparable to the sum of the two stations' previous individual purchase prices in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Three years later, on July 10, 1991, the station changed its call letters to KELF to reflect its new regional Mexican music format branded \"El Elefante\".\n\nOn October 21, 1994, Gold Coast Broadcasting (not to be confused with the aforementioned Gold Coast Communications) purchased KELF and KKZZ from Golden Bear Broadcasting for $1.2 million. The following February, the station adopted the KOCP call letters and launched a classic rock format known as \"95.9 The Octopus\".\n\nOn August 25, 2010, KOCP flipped to classic hits, identifying as \"Rewind 95.9\".

{"id": "2303756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303756", "title": "Nidana", "text": "Nidana\n\nNidana is a Sanskrit word that means \"cause, motivation or occasion\" depending on the context. The word is derived from \"ni\" (down, into) and \"da\" (to bind, \"dana\"). It appears in the \"Rigveda\", such as hymn 10.114.2, and other Hindu scriptures, wherein it means \"primary or first cause, linked cause\"; in other contexts such as \"Rigveda\" 6.32.6, \"nidana\" refers to a rope or band that links, binds or fastens one thing to another, such as a horse to a cart.\n\n\"Nidana\" doctrines of Buddhism are attributed to Shakyamuni Buddha. It has two specific meanings. The more common use refers to the Twelve nidanas or \"\"a concatenation of cause and effect\"\", which is the cycle of rebirth as described by Gautama upon which a re-becoming is thought by Buddhists to rest, which is also called the twelve links of 'dependent origination'.\n\nThe term is also less commonly used with reference to the jhanas or stages of Buddhist meditation. The Twelve nidanas of samsara describe the stages of successive rebirths, based upon ignorance, while the nidana of the jhanas, by contrast, arises from spiritual practice.\n\nAn important example of \"nidanas\" in Buddhism, is the \"Twelve Nidānas\" doctrine where each link is asserted as a primary causal relationship between the connected links. These links present the mechanistic basis of repeated birth, \"Samsara\", and resultant \"Dukkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness) starting from avidyā (ignorance, misconceptions).\n\nThe term \"Nidana\" appears in numerous ancient and medieval Hindu texts wherein it means \"first cause, primary cause, original or essential cause\". This includes the Upanishads that include theosophical speculations, as well as medical texts such as Sushruta Samhita and Charaka Samhita where a large sub-book is titled \"Nidana-sthana\", as well as in chapters of the Puranas, wherein these discuss cause of disease or various natural phenomena.\n\n"}

He had previously played the first fourteen years of his career with the Anaheim Ducks, serving as an alternate captain during his final six seasons with the team.\n\nHe captured a Memorial Cup with the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s London Knights and a gold medal with Canada at the World Junior Championships during his major junior career. Perry was drafted in the first round, 28th overall, by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft and won the Stanley Cup with the club in 2007. In 2008, he recorded 29 goals and 25 assists. He improved in 2009 to 72 points and was named to his first NHL All-Star Game. Perry continued his ascent in 2010 as he scored 27 goals and had 49 assists. In 2011, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player for the 2010–11 season. He led the NHL with 50 goals and finished third in points behind Daniel Sedin and Martin St. Louis, with 98.\n\nInternationally, Perry has won gold medals with Canada at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics. He became a member of the Triple Gold Club after captaining Canada to gold at the 2016 IIHF World Championships, in addition to previously winning the Stanley Cup and the Olympic gold medal. Perry is only the second player (joining Scott Niedermayer) to combine Triple Gold membership with gold at the World Junior Championships, a Memorial Cup win, and a World Cup of Hockey win.\n\nPerry was born on May 16, 1985, in Haileybury, Ontario, the first of two boys born to Geoff and Nancy Perry. He and his brother Adam learned to skate when Corey was two. At age ten, he and his family moved to Peterborough, Ontario. Growing up, his favourite NHL team was the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nPerry grew up playing hockey with the Peterborough Minor Petes AAA organization of the OMHA's Eastern AAA league. In 2001, Perry led his Petes to a victory in the inaugural OHL Cup Bantam AAA championship held in Peterborough. Perry had a stellar year offensively, scoring 73 goals in 67 games.\n\nAfter a standout minor hockey career, Perry was drafted fifth overall into the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) by the London Knights in the 2001 Priority Draft. He immediately produced at a point-per-game pace for the Knights, recording 59 points in 60 games in his rookie season. The following year, his NHL draft year, Perry improved to 78 points and was selected 28th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. It was reported Perry was to be sent to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Mike Comrie, but the trade never materialized, as Oilers general manager Kevin Lowe asked Comrie to repay a portion of his bonus money.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, Perry scored 40 goals and 73 assists for 113 points in just 66 games, becoming the first Knight to reach 100 points in a season since Jason Allison did so in 1994. During the season, the Ducks were considering trading Perry to the Edmonton Oilers for Mike Comrie. The Oilers agreed to acquire Perry for Comrie, though there was one snag in the deal—Edmonton felt that Comrie should return $2.5 million of his salary. Comrie ultimately refused to do so and the trade subsequently fell through. In the OHL playoffs, Perry scored seven more goals, with his offensive prowess earning him a call-up to the Ducks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, for the remainder of the 2003–04 season. Perry was later named an OHL First-Team All-Star after the season.\n\nEntering his fourth and final year with the Knights in 2004–05, Perry scored a junior career-high 130 points in 60 games. He went on to post an additional 38 points in the post-season to capture the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champions, en route to a Memorial Cup championship. In 18 post-season games, Perry scored 11 goals and handed out 27 assists. The Knights shut-out Sidney Crosby's Rimouski Océanic in the final.\n\nPerry made his debut with the Ducks the following season, in 2005–06. However, he was sent down to the AHL early in the year, along with fellow rookie and future linemate Ryan Getzlaf. Perry scored his first career goal against the Edmonton Oilers on October 10, managing to score a point in each of his first four career games. He recorded his first career multi-goal game against the Los Angeles Kings on January 28. Perry and Getzlaf combined for 67 points in 36 games with the Portland Pirates—the Ducks' new AHL affiliate—and were subsequently recalled by the Ducks ahead of the team's run in the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the playoffs, Perry scored no goals but managed three assists as the Ducks were eliminated in the Western Conference Final to Edmonton. Perry finished his rookie season with 25 points in 56 games with Anaheim.\n\nIn 2006–07, Perry improved to 44 points in a full 82 games, playing with Ryan Getzlaf and Dustin Penner on a combination dubbed the \"Kid Line\". He went on in the 2007 playoffs to win the Stanley Cup with Anaheim, scoring 15 points in 21 games. He assisted on a goal in Game 1 against the Ottawa Senators in the Finals while in Game 3, he scored a goal that helped the Ducks take the lead. After the Senators tied the score, Perry assisted on Getzlaf's goal as the Ducks took the lead again. However, the Senators scored the last three goals of the game and won 5–3. In the final game, Perry scored a goal and had an assist. Anaheim went on to win the next two games, securing its first-ever Stanley Cup.\nThe following year, in 2007–08, Perry increased his totals to 29 goals and 54 points and was named to his first NHL All-Star Game as an injury replacement (along with Scott Niedermayer) to join Chris Pronger and Ryan Getzlaf as four Ducks on the Western Conference squad. Perry also made Ducks history during the season—on January 4, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, he scored a goal just 16 seconds into the game, the second fastest goal ever scored by a Duck. Despite the personal successes of the year, Anaheim were unable to replicate the previous year's playoff success, falling to the Dallas Stars in the 2008 Conference Quarterfinals. Perry played in three games and had two goals and an assist. In the subsequent off-season, on July 1, 2008, Perry signed a five-year, $26.625 million contract extension, identical to a contract Ryan Getzlaf had agreed to the previous off-season.\n\nThe 2008–09 season was a break-out year for Perry. He led the Ducks with 32 goals and finished second on the team in points, with 72. On November 1, he recorded five points in a game against the Vancouver Canucks, four of which were assists, a career-high. However, on January 3, Perry was suspended for four games by the NHL after elbowing Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux during the third period of a game on January 2. Perry finished the regular season scoring four goals in the year's last five games. Continuing his scoring streak, he then contributed eight goals and six assists during the 2009 playoffs that saw the Ducks advance to Game 7 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Detroit Red Wings, who ultimately ended the Ducks' season after their Game 7 victory. Perry scored the Ducks' second goal of that game. In Game 1, Perry scored a goal, but the Ducks lost 3–2, while the Ducks won Game 2 as Perry contributed two assists. After recording no points in a Ducks win in Game 3, Perry scored two goals and also recorded an assist in Game 4, but the Ducks lost 6–3. In Game 7, the Ducks lost the game, with Perry scoring a goal and providing an assist.\n\nIn the 2009–10, Perry posted a 19-game point streak that ultimately ended on December 4, 2009, against Dallas. He ended the year with a team-leading 76 points and 111 penalty minutes. He also finished second on the club with 27 goals—trailing only Bobby Ryan's 35—and second in assists, with 49, one short of Ryan Getzlaf's 50.\n\nThe following year, in 2010–11, Perry led the NHL with 50 goals, winning the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as a result, reaching the feat with a hat-trick against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, 2011. With 48 assists, he finished the season with 98 points, third-highest in the NHL. Perry was also chosen to the 2011 NHL All-Star Game, where he won the Shootout Elimination Challenge in the Skills Competition. Perry recorded his first career hat-trick in a game against the Minnesota Wild on December 12; he also recorded two assists in the game, giving him five points. His goals came at even strength, shorthanded and on the power play, making him the second player in Ducks history to score in all three situations, the other being Paul Kariya. After the All-Star Game, Perry exploded offensively—from February 2 to 18, he recorded at least one point in seven consecutive games, and recorded his second career hat-trick on February 5 against the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nNearing the end of the season, Perry continued his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the NHL scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya.\n\nLed by Perry's late-season scoring surge, the Ducks finished with 99 points, good for the fourth seed in the West, setting up a series with the Nashville Predators in the 2011 Western Conference Quarterfinals. After being held to no points in Game 1, Perry scored the Ducks' first goal on a power play in Game 2 against Pekka Rinne, later assisting on Ryan Getzlaf's goal that gave the Ducks a 3–1 lead. Near the end of the game, Perry then assisted on Bobby Ryan's empty-netter as the Ducks won 5–3. In Game 3, Perry recorded another two assists, but the Ducks fell 4–3. In Game 4, he set up Cam Fowler's power play goal early in the first period, and early in the third, Perry scored a short-handed goal to give Anaheim the lead in an eventual 6–3 victory. However, Perry recorded no points in the last two games, both of which the Ducks lost, eliminating them from the playoffs. Perry finished the series with two goals and six assists.\n\nAt the end of the 2010–11 season, Perry won the Hart Memorial Trophy, prevailing over finalists Daniel Sedin and Martin St. Louis, as the NHL's regular season MVP. He became the first Ducks player to win the Hart Trophy and the first Ducks player to win the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy since Teemu Selänne in 1998–99.\n\nFor the 2011–12 season, Perry struggled early in the season, along with the rest of the team. The year was considered an off-year for Perry and his teammates. Despite the struggles, Perry was named to the 2012 NHL All-Star Game. Despite managing to score 37 goals to lead the Western Conference, the Ducks missed the 2012 playoffs after finishing fifth in the Pacific Division and 13th in the Western Conference.\n\nIn the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 season, Perry and his teammates got off to a much better start than the previous season, going 7–1–1 in their first nine games. Although his teammates were finding success scoring goals, Perry struggled to find the back of the net, scoring only one goal in his first 12 games. However, as the season progressed, Perry began to find his scoring touch, ultimately finishing the season with 15 goals and 36 points. In a game against the Minnesota Wild, Perry delivered a late hit to the head of Jason Zucker. After a review of the hit by NHL executive Rob Blake, Perry was given a four-game suspension.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Perry signed an eight-year, $69 million contract extension with the Ducks, ten days after Ryan Getzlaf was signed to a similar eight-year contract. The 2013 playoffs would prove to be a disappointment for Perry, as he failed to score a single goal in the seven game loss to the Detroit Red Wings, despite firing 24 shots on goal.\n\nPerry's 2013–14 season turned out to be one of his best as he had 43 goals and 82 points, helping the Ducks win their second consecutive Pacific Division title. Perry was selected to the First All-Star team for the second time in his career.\n\nPerry was named to his fourth All-Star Game when he was named to the 2016 NHL All-Star Game, along with teammate John Gibson.\n\nPerry's goal production declined during the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons, falling from 34 in 2015–16 to 19 and 17 respectively in the following seasons.\n\nOn September 26, 2018, Perry was ruled out for five months after undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus and MCL injury. He returned during the latter half of the 2018–19 season, contributing with 6 goals and 10 points in 31 games.\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Perry's 14-year tenure with the Ducks ended after he was bought-out from the remaining two years of his eight-year contract to become an unrestricted free agent. \n\nOn July 1, 2019, Perry signed on the opening day of free agency to a bonus laden one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Dallas Stars. On November 13, 2019 He played His 1000th career regular season NHL game against the Calgary Flames at the Scotiabank Saddledome. He became the 340th player in NHL History to hit the milestone. During the 2020 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2020, Perry was issued a game misconduct for elbowing Nashville defenseman Ryan Ellis at 2:40 of the first period. He was subsequently suspended for five games on January 3, 2020 and will forfeit $40,322.60. \n\nPerry helped lead Canadian junior team to a gold medal in the 2005 World Junior Championship, playing alongside Sidney Crosby and Patrice Bergeron on the team's first line.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, Perry was selected to play for Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. On April 16, 2010, Perry was among the first group of 15 players to be named to Canada for participation at the 2010 IIHF World Championships in Cologne, Mannheim and Gelsenkirchen, Germany.\n\nIn Canada's first game of the 2010 Winter Olympics, Perry helped lead the team to an 8–0 victory over Norway, scoring one goal. In the tournament quarterfinals against Russia, he scored another two goals in a 7–3 win, then scored the second goal in the gold medal game against the United States to make the score 2–0 in the second period. Canada went on to win the game 3–2 after an overtime goal by Sidney Crosby, thus winning gold.\n\nPerry contributed one assist in Canada's six games en route to a gold medal victory at the 2014 Winter Olympics over Sweden in Sochi.\n\nPerry's younger brother Adam played alongside him on the London Knights' 2005 Memorial Cup-winning team. Adam was the assistant coach of the London Nationals Junior B Team, although he is currently in law enforcement, like their father. Corey currently lives in London, Ontario, during the off-season and in Newport Coast, California, during the NHL season. Perry married long time girlfriend Blakeny Robertson on July 18, 2015, and together they have a son.\n"}

It is a resident breeder in tropical South America from Colombia southeast to the Guianas and Brazil.\n\nThe southern white-fringed antwren was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his \"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\" in 1775 from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the \"Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle\" which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name \"Turdus griseus\" in his catalogue of the \"Planches Enluminées\". The southern white-fringed antwren is now placed in the genus \"Formicivora\" that was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1824. The generic name combines the Latin words \"formica\" for \"ant\" and \"-vorus\" \"eating\" from \"vorare\" \"to devour\". The specific epithet \"grisea\" is from the Medieval Latin \"griseus\" meaning \"grey\".\n\nThe northern white-fringed antwren (\"Formicivora intermedia\") was previously considered as a subspecies of the southern white-fringed antwren but is now separated as a separate species based on differences in the vocalizations.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognised:\n\nThe southern white-fringed antwren is long, and weighs . The male has a grey-brown crown and upperparts, and black wings, tail, lower face and underparts. There are two conspicuous white wing bars and a white stripe running from above the eye down the sides of the breast and flanks. The tail feathers are tipped with white. The female's upperparts are much like the male, but females of the southern populations are orange below and have an orange supercilium. These occur south and east from southeastern Colombia and southernmost Venezuela. Northern population's females have underparts which are buff with dark streaks.\n\nIt has a \"tu\" whistle followed by a trilled \"churet\", and a repeated and accelerating \"tu-ik\" call. Southern birds also have a repetitive \"chump-chump-chump\" song, quite unlike the northern white-fringed antwren (\"Formicivora intermedia\").\n\nThis is a common and confiding bird of second growth woodland, usually found as territorial pairs. The southern populations are associated with scrubby bushes on white sandy soils and restinga habitat. These birds inhabit the lowlands, up to around 200 m ASL. In some places, they are sympatric with the rusty-backed antwren (\"F. rufa\"). The white-fringed antwren feeds on small insects and other arthropods taken from undergrowth twigs and foliage.\n\nThe female lays two purple-marked creamy white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in a grass hammock nest low in a tree or shrub. Nests are occasionally plundered by predators, for example smallish mammals like the common marmoset (\"Callithrix jacchus\"), despite the birds' attempts to defend their offspring.\n\nOf a total of 13 birds studied in Colombia—in the Parque Nacional de La Macarena and near Turbo—only one was infected with blood parasites (an undetermined \"Plasmodium\" species).\n\nThis bird is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN. However, its resilience to human alteration of habitat is not too pronounced, and in some regions its continuing presence would seem to depend on protection of habitat.\n\n"}

The monohydrate (MoO·HO) and the dihydrate (MoO·2HO) are well characterized. They are yellow diamagnetic solids.\n\nSolid forms of molybdic acid are coordination polymers. The monohydrate MoO·HO consists of layers of octahedrally coordinated MoO·(HO) units where 4 vertices are shared. The dihydrate (image shown above) has the same layer structure with the \"extra\" HO molecule intercalated between the layers.\n\nIn acidified aqueous solutions of molybdic acid, the complex MoO(HO) is observed. Once again, molybdenum adopts octahedral molecular geometry, probably with three oxo ligands and three aquo ligands.\n\nThe salts of molybdic acid are called molybdates. They arise by adding base to solutions of molybdic acid.\n\nMany molybdenum oxides are used as heterogeneous catalysts, e.g. for oxidations. Molybdic acid and its salts are used to make the Froehde reagent for the presumptive identification of alkaloids.\n"}

Under the sudden attack the German company had broke and left the field, while the French under Capt. Legeay also retired from the broken ground they had attempted to occupy. In five minutes, the whole command was in disarray in full and disorderly retreat; in fourteen minutes the Costa Ricans had won the battle. Walker's troops suffered 59 killed and the Costa Ricans 20 killed.\n\nThe Santa Rosa's Casona, one of the few historical sites, was burned down in May 2001 and later re-built.\n\n"}

With a total area of , the forest comprises over 10 separate sections. While in the westernmost sections, Custer National Forest is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the easternmost sections are a combination of forest \"islands\" and grasslands. A portion of the forest is also part of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and constitutes over a third of the wilderness land. South of Red Lodge, Montana, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. 212) passes through the forest en route to Yellowstone National Park.\n\nThe eastern areas are dominated by large stands of ponderosa pine surrounded by grasslands, which are often leased to local ranchers for cattle grazing.\n\nSince 2014, the Custer and Gallatin National Forests are managed together as the Custer-Gallatin National Forest with headquarters in Bozeman, Montana. There are local ranger district offices located in Ashland and Red Lodge in Montana, and in Camp Crook in South Dakota for Custer, and West Yellowstone, Livingston and Gardiner in Montana for Gallatin.\n\nThe western sections have a mixture of pine, spruce and fir trees due to the increased altitude and more abundant rainfall. Higher altitudes deep into the wilderness areas are above timberline and alpine conditions prevail. The tallest mountain in Montana, Granite Peak, is shared with Gallatin National Forest, as is the interesting Grasshopper Glacier, which has millions of grasshoppers that died approximately 300 years ago, entombed within the ice.\n\nWithin the forest are Native American burial grounds, pictographs and petroglyphs. For the plains Indians, the forest provided shelter and a stable food supply. Members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition are generally considered to be the first white Americans to visit the region. The forest is currently divided into three Ranger Districts: Beartooth in Red Lodge, Montana; Ashland in Ashland, Montana; and Sioux in Camp Crook, South Dakota. Four National Grasslands were formerly managed by the forest as the Grand River, Cedar River, Little Missouri and Sheyenne National Grasslands. These units are now managed as the Dakota Prairie Grasslands, headquartered in Bismarck, ND.\n\nThere are over 30 vehicle accessible campgrounds in the forest, as well as numerous picnic areas. Over 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of hiking trails are available with most being found in the western district. Though not plentiful with rivers and lakes, the waterways do provide some opportunities for fishing but little for boating. The forest headquarters is located in Billings, Montana, and most hiking and camping is done in the region south and southwest of Billings. There are local ranger district offices in Ashland and Red Lodge in Montana, and in Camp Crook in South Dakota.\n\nIn descending order of land area the forest is located in parts of Powder River, Carbon, Stillwater, Rosebud, Carter, Sweet Grass, Harding (the only county in South Dakota), and Park counties. Only about 6.2% of the acreage lies in South Dakota.\n\nA relatively rare type of small falcon known as the merlin is found here in greater concentrations than anywhere else in the United States.

On July 1, 1908 the name was changed to Custer. On January 13, 1920 the entire Sioux National Forest was added, which now comprises the Sioux Ranger District of Custer, extending into South Dakota. Sioux had previously absorbed Cave Hills, Ekalaka, Long Pine, Short Pine and Slim Buttes National Forests on July 1, 1908.

{"id": "2303791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303791", "title": "Citadelle Laferrière", "text": "Citadelle Laferrière\n\nThe Citadelle Laferrière or, Citadelle Henri Christophe, or simply the Citadelle (), is a large mountaintop fortress in Nord, Haiti, located on top of the mountain Bonnet a L’Eveque, approximately south of the city of Cap-Haïtien, southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and uphill from the town of Milot. It is one of the largest fortresses in the Americas and was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a World Heritage Site in 1982—along with the nearby Sans-Souci Palace. The mountaintop fortress has itself become an icon of Haiti. The Citadel was built by Henri Christophe, a key leader during the Haitian slave rebellion (1791–1804), after Haiti gained independence from France at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nThe massive stone structure was built by up to 20,000 workers between 1805 and 1820 as part of a system of fortifications designed to keep the newly independent nation of Haiti safe from French incursions. The Citadel was built several kilometres inland, and atop the Bonnet a L’Eveque mountain, to deter attacks and to provide a lookout into the nearby valleys. Cap-Haïtien and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are visible from the roof of the fortress. \n\nThe Haitians outfitted the fortress with 365 cannons of varying size. These were obtained from various nations, and still bear the crests of 18th Century monarchs. Enormous stockpiles of cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls. Since its construction, the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes, though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned.\n\nHenri Christophe initially commissioned the fortress in 1805. At the time, Christophe was a general in the Haitian army and chief administrator of the country's northern regions. In 1806, Alexandre Pétion launched a coup against Haiti's emperor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Though General Christophe was aware of this through his system of spies, he did not warn Dessalines, viewing his assassination as a necessary evil that would permit him to achieve his goals. Dessalines's death led to a power struggle between Christophe and Pétion, which ended with Haiti divided into northern and southern states, with the north under Christophe's presidency by 1807. He declared himself king in 1811.\n\nThe Citadel was part of a system of fortifications that included Fort Jacques and Fort Alexandre, built on the mountains overlooking Cap Haitien. Dessalines ordered those forts built in 1805 to protect the new nation against French attacks.\nIn the event of an invasion, Christophe planned to have his military burn the valuable crops and food stocks along the coast, then retreat to the fortress, setting ambushes along the sole mountain path leading to the Citadel.\n\nChristophe suffered a stroke in 1820, and some of his troops mutinied. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide—according to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet. Loyal followers covered his body in quicklime and entombed it in one of the Citadel's interior courtyards to prevent others from mutilating the corpse.\n\nThe colossal physical dimensions of the fortress have made it a Haitian national symbol, featured on currency, stamps, and tourist ministry posters. The fortress walls rise from the mountaintop and the entire complex, including cannonball stocks but excluding the surrounding grounds, covers an area of . Workers laid the large foundation stones of the fortress directly into the stone of the mountaintop, using a mortar mixture that included quicklime, molasses, and the blood of local cows and goats—and cows hooves that they cooked to a glue and added to the mix to give the mortar added strength and bonding power.\n\nLarge cisterns and storehouses in the fortress's interior were designed to store enough food and water for 5,000 defenders for up to one year. The fortress included palace quarters for the king and his family, in the event that they needed to take refuge within its walls. Other facilities included dungeons, bathing quarters, and bakery ovens. Also visible is the tomb of Christophe's brother-in-law, killed when the gunpowder room he was in exploded.\n\nThe Citadel's appearance from the trail leading up to its base has been likened to the prow of a great stone ship, jutting out from the mountainside. The structure is angular and assumes different geometric forms based on the viewer's orientation. Some of the angles on the Citadelle were intentionally put there by Christophe to deviate cannonballs if attacked and the Epaulette is a great example of using angles to deviate and deflect shots. Though most of the fortress has no roof as such (the interior top is a latticework of stone walkways), some slanted portions are adorned with bright red tiles. The fortress has been repaired and refurnished several times since its construction, including in the 1980s with help from UNESCO and the World Monuments Fund, though little of it has been replaced and its design remains the same.\n\nThe Citadel is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Haiti. Directions to and history of the fortress are provided by self-appointed guides from the town of Milot. Near the entrance to Sans-Souci Palace, which is at the start of the trail to the Citadel, visitors may be asked to pay a small fee. Visitors are also encouraged to rent a horse for the uphill trek. The first portion of the 11 kilometre (7 mi) trail is navigable by 4WD vehicle, although infrequent landslides and construction projects sometimes make this unreliable. Numerous people live along the trail and sell souvenirs or drinks, such as fresh coconut juice, to travelers. Drinks are a necessity in the tropical heat. The trail is paved stone, generally smooth and in good condition.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the way up from the parking lot, visitors must complete the final portion on horseback or on foot. The entire 11-kilometre (7 mi) trail, starting in Milot, is almost completely uphill, but can be walked by experienced hikers who carry plenty of water. Most of the interior of the Citadel fortress itself is accessible to visitors, who may also climb the numerous staircases to the fortress's roof, which is free of guardrails. On a clear day, the city of Cap-Haïtien and the Atlantic Ocean can be seen to the north. Because of its elevation the top of the Citadel is used by United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for a Radio repeater, with an antenna on the highest point.\n\nThough the turbulent political situation in Haiti (principally in the central region) has deterred visitors in recent years, the regions of the north and south of the country remain largely peaceful, making travel to the Citadel less challenging or hazardous than travel within the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nAfter visiting the Citadel in July 2012, Haitian President Michel Martelly heavily criticized the Haitian National Institute for Historic Preservation (ISPAN) — the organization tasked with preserving Haiti's cultural heritage sites — describing the site as in a state of disrepair and calling ISPAN's efforts \"unacceptable\". His visit was intended to assess the state of the Citadel for conservation, but he refused to visit its upper levels, deeming them unsafe for visitors.\n\nDespite Haiti's shortcomings in preserving its own cultural artifacts, international organizations have stepped in to assist, such as the Global Heritage Fund, a California-based non-profit organization, which has investigated the Citadel for monument conservation, community development, training and cultural heritage revitalization. The project would focus on both the Citadel and nearby Sans-Souci Palace, with hopes of preserving the structures as safe tourism sites to promote sustainable local economic growth.\n\n"}

Scores acquired from the F-scale could be directly associated with background components, educational level, and intellectual capacity. It is an indirect type of test that ensures the result would not be due to the individual's fake responses; this is possible because the purpose of the measurement and which attitude is being measured are initially concealed from the participants. The existence of this correlation could possibly affect the way in which the F-scale accurately measures the authoritarian personality syndrome. The F-Test has two principal purposes: it aims to measure prejudice and anti-democratic tendencies at the personality level.\n\nThe purpose of the F-scale is to measure an antidemocratic personality structure, usually defined by authoritarianism. A score of above 80 on the F-scale test indicates that the subject may be suffering from severe psychopathology. Patients who suffer from repeated episodes of disorders usually get a higher F-scale score than those who have acute disorders. Research has not found any correlation between F-scale scores and educational level.\n\nThe scale specifically examines the following personality dimensions:\n\nF-scale tests measure not only the subject's overall level of stress but also his or her willingness to cooperate in the testing process.\n\nResearch in the late 1960s focused on police and the detection of authoritarianism.\n\nAccording to data presented by Baljeet Ahmed Muhammad, a hypothesis was formed proposing that brighter people are capable of penetrating the significance of the F scale, helping them react in a more “suitable” fashion. Hence, because the F scale can be faked, it cannot be considered as an indirect measure. In the course of the Minnesota Adoption Study it was found that \"the F-Scale scores were negatively correlated with WAIS vocabulary [an IQ test] (-0.42) and showed the same pattern of family correlations\".\n\nThe scale has attracted a great deal of criticism, since it is ideological and associates societal processes with personality characteristics.\n\nAmong the criticisms of the F-scale is its sensitivity to respondents with acquiescent response styles due to being worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response. A number of related scales such as the Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale and the Balanced F-scale have been created in an attempt to fix the shortcomings of the F-scale. Bob Altemeyer's Right-wing authoritarianism Scale is the most frequently used, contemporary descendant of the F-scale.\n\nAnother criticism of the test is the assumption that users with a high score are unsophisticated and may lack social intelligence. According to Kelman and Barclay (1963), the experience of the participant is reflected on the test score; \"i.e.\", they may not be able to see the obvious pattern and motives recurring in the test and be ignorant of it.\n\n\n"}

Relativity Records soon signed Common, and prepared to release three singles for his debut album. The first and best-charting single was 1992's \"Take It EZ\". It reached #5 on the Hot Rap Singles chart while his next two singles, \"Breaker 1/9\" and \"Soul by the Pound,\" reached #10 and #7 respectively.

He served as Insurance Commissioner of California from 1995–2000 and as a California State Assemblyman representing the 22nd District, from 1986–1994.\n\nAs a child, he grew up in a military family and after graduating University of Notre Dame on a full ROTC scholarship, he joined the United States Army and rose to the rank of Captain as a helicopter pilot. In 1982, he left the military to join the family business in Silicon Valley. He was elected as a Republican to the California Assembly in 1986.\n\nIn 1994 he was elected insurance commissioner, effectively applying considerable campaign contributions from various insurance companies. He won re-election in 1998. At this point, Quackenbush was considered the most promising Republican elected official in the state of California.\n\nIn early 2000, Cindy Ossias, then a senior lawyer for the California Department of Insurance\n(CDI), charged the Department with corruption. According to testimony by CDI employees, including Ossias and staff attorney Robert Hagedorn, Commissioner Quackenbush and his top aides abused their positions for personal gain and acted against consumers' interests for many years.\n\nAfter the 1994 Northridge earthquake, it was alleged that Quackenbush allowed insurance companies to compensate their clients much less than the actual damages. In exchange, the insurance companies set up special \"educational funds\". Those funds were used to create television commercials in which Quackenbush appeared as a basketball referee with Shaquille O'Neal in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform. While couched as public service announcements, suspicions rose that main idea behind the commercials was to increase Quackenbush's name identification, which is critical for electoral success in California statewide races.\n\nIn addition to the educational funds, those same insurance companies contributed to his wife's unsuccessful 1998 assembly campaign, as well as his children's football camps.\n\nInitially, Cindy Ossias blew the whistle as an anonymous source. When her identity was revealed, Quackenbush put her on an administrative leave for violation of attorney client privilege.\n\nOn June 28, 2000, he announced his resignation (to become effective on July 10).\n\nIn February 2002, an 18-month investigation conducted by federal, state and Sacramento County prosecutors ended with prosecutors declining to press charges against Quackenbush, as they felt the evidence was not strong enough.\n\nAfter resigning as California's insurance commissioner, Quackenbush moved to Hawaii, where he was \"doing political and military intelligence consulting\". Quackenbush then moved to Florida and in 2005 became a sheriff's deputy in Lee County, Florida.\nIn 2007 he was suspended for accepting free food.\n\nWhile working as a sheriff's deputy in February 2008, Quackenbush shot and critically wounded a suspect who was reported as resisting arrest. He was placed on paid leave during the investigation of the shooting.\n\nIn September 2016, he was forced to resign, after making several racially controversial Facebook postings. At the time of his resignation from the Sheriff Department, he also served as the vice chair of the Lee County Republican Executive Committee and his wife was running for the Lee County school board.\n\n"}

The city is a popular holiday and conference centre and the administrative and commercial hub and the capital city of the Garden Route.\n\nThe city is situated roughly halfway between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth on the Garden Route. It is situated on a 10-kilometre plateau between the Outeniqua Mountains to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south. The former township of Pacaltsdorp, now a fully incorporated suburb, lies to the south.\n\nThe city of George was established as a result of the growing demand for timber and the wood used in building, transport and furniture. In 1776 the Dutch East India Company established an outpost for the provision of timber; its location is thought to be near the western end of York Street. The Timber Post had its own Poshouer (manager), some 12 woodcutters, a blacksmith, wagon maker and 200 oxen plus families. After 1795 and the British occupation of the Cape, a caretaker of the forests in the area was appointed. After the second British occupation in 1806, it was decided that the Swellendam magistracy was too large and needed to be sub-divided. George was chosen because of the availability of good water. In 1811 George was declared a separate district and Tiaan Swart was appointed the first Landrost (magistrate) and the town was proclaimed by the Earl of Caledon, governor of the Cape Colony on St George's Day, 23 April 1811, and named after the reigning British monarch, King George III. One of Van Kervel's first acts as Landrost (Mayor), was to dig a furrow to supply the first thirty six plots in George with water. An 1819 map shows the original furrows and storage dam where they remain to this day in the Garden Route Botanical Gardens. The first Furrow originated from the Rooirivier (Red river) and later a diversionary weir was built at the Camphersdrift River. George gained municipal status in 1837.\n\nFrom 1772 there was a gradual influx of settlers intent on making a living from the forests. These were mostly descendants of the Dutch settlers. In early days the lives and livelihood of the people revolved around the timber industry and the rich forests in the vicinity and it remained a quiet outpost. It was the dramatic improvement of communications – the roads, rail and air links eclipsing the ox-wagons and coastal steamers of the 19th century - that exposed other charms and resources of the region and resulted in unprecedented growth for the town.\n\nAfter the ostrich feather slump and a severe drought in the Karoo during the early part of the 18th century, many \"bywoners\" found themselves without work. Rather than stay in an arid region they crossed the mountains to find a livelihood in the forests.\n\nForest settlements, such as Karatara and Bergplaas (1922) were started and many of the \"dangerous\" working-class people from the Transvaal were moved to these settlements. They were, however, a minority group, as most of the woodcutters lived outside these settlements. A small number were descendants of British immigrants who could find no other means of livelihood. There were also a small number of Italian immigrants who had been brought to the area from Turin in 1879, as part of a scheme to start a silk industry in the Knysna area. It turned out to be a complete failure due to the lack of mulberry leaves. Finding themselves without work some of these Italians drifted into the forests and joined the woodcutting community.\n\nSons were considered to be an economic asset as, at the age of around 14 or 15, after very little schooling, they could assist their fathers in the forest. The majority of these sons eventually became woodcutters themselves.\n\nThe Forest Act of 1913 required all woodcutters to be registered. In 1939 all remaining woodcutters were removed from the forests and given a government pension.\n\nFrom the beginning of European colonisation in South Africa in 1652, timber and the provision of various woods was of paramount importance for the survival of the settlers. Once forest areas near the present Cape Town were exhausted, the search for more timber continued along the coast.\n\nThe great forests of the Southern Cape were discovered as early as 1711, but because of their inaccessibility it was only in 1776 that the Dutch East India Company established a timber post where George is today.\n\nEarly woodcutters and their families lived in forest clearings where they evolved into a closely knit community where intermarriage was common. The men were thin and wiry, but they were also tough and strong with an incredible skill in felling, sawing and handling timber.\n\nThe utilization of the forest trees led to such industries as furniture and wagon making. By 1910 several large sawmills had been established in the district. Timber for export was transported to coastal ports by ox wagon.\n\nToday you will find sawmills with the ultimate in modern wood technology and innovative furniture factories in the Southern Cape. Unique to this area is the age-old technique and skill of manufacturing wood furniture by hand.\n\nWhat the visitor sees in the George museum today has grown from the private collections of one man, Charles Sayers. He was the owner and long-time editor of the \"George & Knysna Herald\", a newspaper established by his parents in 1881. Sayers collected and preserved all aspects of his hometown's history, with a specialist interest in old mechanical musical instruments and typewriters which today form the nucleus of the museum's important collections.\n\nIn 1966 he opened his \"Mini Museum\" to the public, housed in a single room adjoining a café in Courtenay Street. The people loved it and much encouraged by local authorities he moved to the original George Town House – the administrative building next to the market square which dated back to 1847. By now the Sayers Museum had attracted the attention of officialdom and barely six months after the move it attained provincial museum status as a fully-fledged cultural history museum for the region, with indigenous timber and its allied industries as its main theme. The growing popularity led to another move, this time to the building, which had been the original drostdy (magistrate's residence and office) in the young town. The original \"Mini Museum\" has been re-created within the present George Museum. George is also the home town of the famous Adre Le Roux, who drove out the Portuguese and lay claim to the land that was rightfully hers.\n\nIn 1668 the first European explorer, Hieronymous Cruse, penetrated Outeniqualand with its dense indigenous forest. The highest peak in the Outeniquas is Cradock Peak (1578 m) and the prominent George Peak is 1337 metres high.\n\nThe name Outeniqua is derived from the Khoi word meaning \"man laden with honey\". The slopes of the emerald-green mountains were covered with heather and swarming with bees, according to the reports left by early travellers. \"Nature has made an enchanting abode of this beautiful place\", wrote the 18th century traveller Le Vaillant, when he entered the foothills of the Outeniqua range in the Southern Cape. A great deal of that enchantment and delicate beauty still captivates the modern traveller. For instance, there is the rare George lily (Cyrtanthus elatus), found near water in the deep ravines of the mountain, and a variety of ericas and proteas thrive on the fern-clothed slopes. Carpets of pink watsonias are a common sight during summer.\n\nThe historic Montagu Pass between George and Oudtshoorn was declared a National Monument in 1972. It is open to traffic and is a good gravel road, some 10 km in length. With many serpentine curves, this pass gradually winds its way through the fynbos-covered Cradock's Kloof until it reaches the summit.\n\nThe world traveller Anthony Trollope visited George in about 1878 and his comment on the Montagu Pass was: \"...equal to some of the mountain roads through the Pyrenees\". Emma Murray was so enthralled by the Montagu Pass that she wrote in a letter to a relative in 1852: \"One forgets everything in the beauty and grandeur of the scene. It was to me exquisite enjoyment\".\n\nA traveller will notice that some parts of the stone wall along one side of the road are slightly protruding. The purpose of this was to prevent the axles of the wagons from scraping against the walls and thus becoming damaged.\n\nThe Civil Commissioner of George, Egbertus Bergh (1837–1843), campaigned tirelessly for a new road through the formidable Outeniqua Mountains to replace the notorious Cradock's Pass. Then came John Montagu, the new dynamic Colonial Secretary, who cleared the public debt, recognised the importance of good roads and set the wheels rolling.\n\nWork on the pass commenced in 1844 and H.O. Farrel was appointed superintendent of the project, but the task was beyond his ability. Henry Fancourt White, a qualified surveyor, newly appointed as Road Inspector by the Central Road Board, replaced him in 1845.\n\nOn average, 250 convicts were employed at any given time on the construction of the pass. They were housed in two camps: South Station, remnants of the old brick chimneys can be seen on your right whilst going up the Outeniqua pass just before the 2nd Montagu Pass turn off, and North Station near the summit of the pass. The headquarters for the construction was sited where Blanco is situated today.\n\nThe total expenses for the construction of the Montagu Pass amounted to £35,799 of which £1,753 was spent on gunpowder. Five and a half miles of the pass had to be blasted out of solid rock.\n\nThe building of the railway line over the Outeniqua Mountains, between George and Oudtshoorn began in December 1908 from the George side and in 1911 from the Oudtshoorn side. The track was blasted out of the rock, and seven tunnels were excavated. At one stage some 2 500 workers were employed. During April 1913 this most scenic railway line was completed. Sir David de Villiers Graaff performed the official opening on 6 August 1913. The line was built at the enormous cost of £465 000.\n\nDuring the construction of the Montagu Pass, in about 1847, a stone toll house, with a thatched roof, was erected on the George side of the mountain. According to a proclamation in the Government Gazette of 24 February 1848, a toll gate was set up, and a tariff of tolls publicised. Upon payment of the prescribed fee the toll keeper would raise the bar across the road to enable the vehicle or animal to pass.\n\nThe first toll-keeper was John Kirk Smith, born in Nottingham, England in 1818. During 1849 he collected the amount of £400.13.8p in toll fees. His son William Kirk Smith was appointed toll-keeper in 1880. William and his son made \"veldt schoens\" (simple leather shoes) at the toll-house for sale to travellers and transport riders. Soon they had a thriving business and J.K. Smith, grandson of the first toll-keeper, expanded this concern to Market Street in George. From this humble beginning grew the large and flourishing shoe industry J.K. Smith and Company, which was the forerunner of Modern Shoes Ltd.\n\nOther early toll-keepers were James Scott (1852) and Charles Searle (1858). The toll-house caught fire on 23 July 1855 and the entire roof was destroyed, later being replaced with corrugated iron.\n\nIn the Government Gazette dated 16 July 1867, the toll-tariffs were:\nEach wheel of a vehicle – two pence;\nAnimal drawing a vehicle – one penny;\nAnimal not drawing a vehicle – two pence;\nSheep, goat or pig – one halfpenny.\n\nAll tolls were abolished on 31 December 1918, but thanks to the fact that it was declared a National Monument in 1970, this interesting relic of the last century has been saved for posterity.\n\nHenry Fancourt White, enchanted by Outeniqualand, bought a portion of the farm Modder River in 1848. He sold a portion to Frances Cook, who named his farm Oaklands, and subdivided the rest into erven. The little village was called \"Whitesville\" in honour of Henry Fancourt White, but at his suggestion the name was changed to Blanco, the Spanish term for white.\n\nIn 1859 Henry White built a beautiful double storey thatched mansion, which he named Blanco House. In 1903 his son Ernest Montagu White renamed the house Fancourt – in honour of his father. Today Fancourt is a National Monument and a well-known hotel.\n\nThe main route from Mossel Bay to the Langkloof passed through Blanco, where a settlement of merchants was soon established. The village was also the main postal centre. This caused dissatisfaction among the businessmen of George, and so a direct link from George to the toll-house was built in about 1882. This road was called Bain's Trace and was probably built by Thomas Bain, who surveyed the new route.\n\nThe lakes originated about 20 000 years ago during the Late Pleistocene at the end of the last era of ice ages which was largely centred in the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, these lakes can be regarded as geologically relatively young.\nDuring that last glacial period, the sea-level dropped to about 130 m lower than at present as a result of the accumulation of ice in the Northern Hemisphere. Rivers then extended into the newly exposed coastal areas, cutting deep valleys into them.\nAt the end of the last glacial period the sea-level rose again, drowning these newly formed valleys until, after a last slight rise and fall of sea-level, a level of about one to three metres above the present level was reached some 6 000 years ago. The sea level then slowly receded to reach the present level about 4 000 years ago.\nThe partial draining of these valleys exposed part of the coastal area, thereby forming all the present Wilderness Lakes except for Langvlei and Rondevlei. Martin (1962) postulates the Langvlei could have been formed by wave erosion preceding the last rise in sea level while Rondevlei, during the same time, probably originated as a wind-deflating basin. Ruigtevlei, to the east of Swartvlei, was a lake that disappeared, leaving a large area that is only inundated after floods (Martin, 1960a).\nDuring this last change (drop) in sea level, the mouth of Swartvlei Estuary moved 2 km eastward to the present position at Sedgefield, Groenvlei lost its connection to the sea through the Swartvlei Estuary, and sand dunes now effectively covered any traces of a previous connection to the sea.\n\nGeorge has an oceanic climate, with warm summers, and mild to chilly winters. It is one of the highest rainfall regions in South Africa. Most rain falls in the winter and spring months, brought by the humid sea winds from the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe 2001 Census divided the urban area of George into four \"main places\": George proper, population 68,557; Thembalethu, population 31,999; Pacaltsdorp, population 18,285; and Lawaaikamp, population 2,458. This gives a total population of 121,299 in the urban area. 51.2% of these people were female and 48.8% were male.\n\nOf the total urban population, 49.5% described themselves as Coloured, 29.3% as \"Black African\", 20.9% as \"White\", and 0.3% as \"Indian or Asian\". 65.4% spoke Afrikaans as their home language, 26.9% spoke Xhosa, 6.9% spoke English, and 0.9% spoke some other language.\n\nGeorge has a sophisticated infrastructure with banks, conference facilities, businesses and shopping centres including the Garden Route Mall and Eden Meander, transport and sporting facilities, yet retains its small town atmosphere. The city is also a major accommodation centre.\n\nGeorge has numerous world-class golf courses, some designed by famous golfers. The most well-known is Fancourt Golf Estate, which hosted the Presidents Cup in 2003 and is often the host to high-profile golf tournaments.\n\nEvery December through 2010, top national rugby sevens teams from around the world came to Outeniqua Park for the South Africa Sevens, one of the tournaments in the IRB Sevens World Series. However, the tournament was moved to Port Elizabeth. December 2015 the Tournament was moved to the Green Point stadium in Cape Town.\n\nGeorge has many historical landmarks:\n\nThe First Class School for girls was started by Miss Christina Petronella van Niekerk, a \"New Age\" young lady with visions for the future which were very different from those ideas held by the conservative population of George.\n\nGeorge is often used a base to explore Tsitsikamma National Park.\n\nThe Outeniqua Choo Tjoe was South Africa's last scheduled mixed steam train service and operated on the Outeniqualand Preserved Railway between George and Knysna on the Garden Route. Opened in 1928 and declared a preserved line in July 1993, this train winds its way through picturesque scenery. However, after a landslide disrupted operations in 2007 service was maintained on the section between George, Hartenbos and Mossel Bay. In 2010 Transnet, the South African railway authority, decided to discontinue all operations of the Choo-Tjoe train.\n\nThe Outeniqua Transport Museum houses a large collection of steam locomotives and carriages.\n\nThe Garden Route Botanical Garden is situated the top of Caledon Street.The Garden Route boasts the largest continuous natural forest area in South Africa, covering some 650 km. Marketable timber is harvested from 20% of the State forest. Stinkwood, named for its unmistakable odour when freshly cut, is highly prized by the furniture industry, as are white pear, hard pear, ironwood and assegaai. The most sought after timber is the outeniqua yellowwood (\"Podocarpus falcatus\").\n\nAnnually the city of George plays host to several local, national and international events.\n\nThe George Old Car Show started in 1997 on Paul Fick's farm \"Blackwood\" near Victoria Bay. A total of 80 cars were on show and food stalls were provided by the George Lions Club. The 2nd show was held at the George Riding Club in 1998 and approximately 250 cars and tractors were on show. The new car dealers were invited to display their latest models and the show was well supported by the public. Various displays like dog shows, gymnastics, a horse parade and a drive-by so that clubs could show off their cars, entertained the public. Arts in the park and food stalls as well as a well-stocked beer garden entertained those who were tired of looking at cars. A model car show was also laid on. The George Old Car Show was held at the riding club until 2000 when it once again ran out of space and had to seek larger grounds.\n\nThe 4th George Old Car Show was moved to the P.W. Botha College in York Street, George. Ample space for show cars, tractors and motorcycles was available on the site as well as large grounds for public parking. The hostels are available for accommodation to exhibitors and a full-time arena program held the public's attention. The school provided food stalls and the income benefited the school fund. The 8th [lGeorge Old Car Show was held in February 2004 and was by then rated as the 2nd largest motor show in South Africa and was supported by CAR Magazine. A total of 750 cars dated from 1901 to the latest models were on show. Forty restored tractors and a large variety of motorcycles were on show. The model car show proved to be more popular than ever and more than 5000 models were on display and for sale. The \"arts in the park\" had also evolved into a show of its own. Various motor clubs were in attendance.\n\nAs this is not a static show all clubs had the opportunity to take part in the drive-by. The show has continued to grow, both in the number of exhibitors as well as in popularity with each successive year.\n\nAn annual event held in winter time since 2002, the George Cheese Festival has grown exponentially in its popularity. This popular family festival cater to both the seasoned & veteran cheese & wine enthusiasts.\n\nCheese Makers, Wine Cellars & recently Chocolatiers have presented their cheese, wine & chocolate pairings to the public over a three-day period.\n\nIn 2013, the festival was expanded to include a gala evening to kick off the start of the festival with a stage performance by Steve Hofmeyr.\n\nThe inaugural Sevens Premier League staged in George on 14–15 December 2012 was a rip-roaring success both on and off the field.\n\nPacaltsdorp Church is the oldest in the Southern Cape and the 6th oldest in the country, completed in 1825. The Norman-style church has thick stonewalls and features a tall square tower topped by battlements. Across the road is the little mud house in which the first missionary, Charles Pacalt of the London Missionary Society, lived after arriving in 1813.\n\nThe Dutch Reformed Mother Church was consecrated in 1842 after taking 12 years to build with its 23-metre domed tower and 1 metre thick walls. It is the 7th oldest church in South Africa. It was constructed by a supervisor and a number of skilled slaves who continued to work as 'apprentices' after the emancipation of slaves in 1834.\n\nCompleted in 1843, St Peter & St Paul Catholic Church in Meade Street is the oldest Catholic Church in South Africa.\n\nSt Mark's Anglican Cathedral, designed by Sophy Gray and built in 1850, attained cathedral status in 1911. It was the smallest cathedral in the Southern Hemisphere until extensions in 1924–25. The nave is the oldest section. Its most distinctive feature is the number of stained glass windows in relation to its size.\n\nSchools include the Afrikaans-medium George High School established in 1947 and Hoërskool Outeniqua established in 1923. The English medium school is York High School and there is also a double medium technical school named Eden Technical High School (formerly PW Botha College). Several independent schools have been established such as Glenwood House, an English medium co-ed school from Grade 000 to Grade 12.\n\nGeorge is the tertiary hub of the Southern Cape, with some public and private institutions providing education at various campuses.\n\n\nThe N2 national route passes by George in an east–west along the coast; George is east of Cape Town and west of Port Elizabeth. The N9 and N12 national routes start in George and run concurrently north over the Outeniqua Pass; on the other side of the pass they divide, with the N12 continuing north to Oudtshoorn and then through Meiringspoort to Beaufort West, while the N9 runs northeast to Graaff-Reinet and Colesberg.\n\nThere is no scheduled passenger service to George. Rovos Rail and the Union Limited however offer vintage train trips to the Garden Route. The Outeniqua Choo Tjoe steam train offered leisure rides between George and Mosselbay but closed in 2009.\n\nGeorge Airport (IATA code GRJ), situated approximately 7 km from the city centre, has scheduled flights to Cape Town International Airport, King Shaka International Airport (Durban), Bram Fischer International Airport (Bloemfontein) and OR Tambo International Airport (Johannesburg).\n\nA public bus service branded Go George was launched in 2014. Routes now cover a significant portion of the city.\n\nThe majority of structures in George are limited to low-mid rise development, most of which is in the commercial sector. The tallest structure in George is the Sentech Tower, which is a radio and television transmitter tower located at the foot of the Outeniqua mountains () This is followed by the Telkom Tower located in the George CBD and the FAGG Radar Tower (55m) located at the George Airport.\n\nThe tallest building in George is the airport radar tower. The concrete tower stands at 45m and 8 storeys (including the spherical radome, it stands at 55m). The George Medi-Clinic building (previously Lamprecht Clinic) stands at 40m and 8 storeys.\n\nThe Executive Mayor of George is Alderman Melvin Naik.\n\nMunicipality (1) — By 1931, the municipality had adopted a pseudo-heraldic \"coat of arms\", which was depicted on a cigarette card issued in that year. The shield was quartered in sky blue and gold, the quarters separated by a white-edged red cross and depicting (1) a mountain, (2) a Knysna loerie, (3) flowers and (4) an oak tree. A bushbuck stood above the shield. The motto was \"Semper amabile\".\n\nMunicipality (2) — On 30 April 1957, the council approved a new coat of arms, designed by Ivan Mitford-Barberton and H. Ellis Tomlinson. The arms were granted by the College of Arms on 6 August 1958, and were later registsred at the Bureau of Heraldry in April 1994.\n\nThe arms are : \"Quarterly, Gules and Argent, a cross per cross counterchanged, between in the first quarter a horse courant of the second, in the second quarter a Knysna loerie perched upon a branch in bend sinister, in the third quarter a protea flower slipped and leaved, proper, and in the fourth quarter an oak tree fructed, the trunk couped, Argent\". In layman's terms : the shield is quartered red and silver, the quarters are separated by a cross, and they depict (1) a running silver horse, (2) a Knysna loerie perched on a branch, (3) a protea flower with stem and leaves and (4) an oak tree. The crest is a bushbuck, and the motto remains \"Semper amabile\".\nDivisional council arms — The George divisional council (the local authority which administered the rural areas outside the town) assumed a coat of arms in 1961, and registered them with the Cape Provincial Administration in June 1962.\n\nThe arms, designed by Schalk Pienaar, were : \"Vert, on a chief dancetty Argent three apples slipped and leaved proper; a base barry wavy of six Argent and Azure.\" In layman's terms : a green shield displaying at the top three apples on a silver stripe with a zig-zag edge and at the bottom six wavy silver and blue stripes. The crest was a protea flower, the supporters were two bushbuck, and the motto \"Regio melle dulcior\".\n\nThe City of George is made up of a number of suburbs:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2303855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303855", "title": "Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses", "text": "Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses\n\nThroughout the history of Jehovah's Witnesses, their beliefs, doctrines, and practices have engendered controversy and opposition from local governments, communities, and religious groups. Many Christian denominations consider the interpretations and doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses to be heretical, and some professors of religion have described the group as a cult.\n\nAccording to law professor Archibald Cox, in the United States, Jehovah's Witnesses were \"the principal victims of religious persecution … they began to attract attention and provoke repression in the 1930s, when their proselytizing and numbers rapidly increased.\" Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries, including Cuba, the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Nazi Germany. The denomination's doctrine of political neutrality has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription (for example in Britain during World War II and afterwards during the period of compulsory national service).\n\nDuring the World Wars, Jehovah's Witnesses were targeted in the United States, Canada, and many other countries for their refusal to serve in the military or help with war efforts. In Canada, Jehovah's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Japanese and Chinese descent. Activities of Jehovah's Witnesses have previously been banned in the Soviet Union and in Spain, partly due to their refusal to perform military service. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, for example in Singapore, China, Vietnam, Russia and many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nDuring the first presidency of Mathieu Kérékou, activities of Jehovah's Witnesses were banned and members were forced to undergo \"demystification training.\"\n\nIn Bulgaria, Jehovah's Witnesses have been targets of violence by right wing nationalist groups such as the IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. On April 17, 2011, a group of about sixty hooded men carrying BMPO flags besieged a Kingdom Hall in Burgas, during the annual memorial of Christ's death. Attackers threw stones, damaged furniture, and injured at least five of the people gathered inside. The incident was recorded by a local television station. Jehovah's Witnesses in Bulgaria have been fined for proselytizing without proper government permits, and some municipalities have legislation prohibiting or restricting their rights to preach.\n\nIn 1984, Canada released a number of previously classified documents which revealed that in the 1940s, \"able bodied young Jehovah's Witnesses\" were sent to \"camps\", and \"entire families who practiced the religion were imprisoned.\" The 1984 report stated, \"Recently declassified wartime documents suggest [World War II] was also a time of officially sanctioned religious bigotry, political intolerance and the suppression of ideas. The federal government described Jehovah's Witnesses as subversive and offensive 'religious zealots' … in secret reports given to special parliamentarian committees in 1942.\" It concluded that, \"probably no other organization is so offensive in its methods, working as it does under the guise of Christianity. The documents prepared by the justice department were presented to a special House of Commons committee by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in an attempt to justify the outlawing of the organizations during the second world war.\"\n\nAccording to Bitter Winter, an online magazine discussing religious freedom and human rights in China, Jehovah's Witnesses' activities in China are considered illegal. It also reports that foreign missionaries are deported, members' homes are raided, and members express concern about being followed by police. Bitter Winter also reported that China's official anti-cult website openly supported Russia's ban of the denomination, stating that the group should be strictly controlled or even banned.\n\nFormer Canadian-American Jehovah's Witness missionary Amber Scorah recounted the lengths that she and her husband went through to preach illegally in China. She reports needing to falsify their visa application to enter the country and lying to co-workers about why they immigrated there. She describes how local Jehovah's Witnesses were forced to meet secretly in a different location every week, with invites by word-of-mouth only. She also describes how they would vet potential converts to make sure they had no communist ties or leanings.\n\nUnder Fidel Castro's communist regime, Jehovah's Witnesses were considered \"social deviants\", along with homosexuals, vagrants, and other groups, and were sent to forced labor concentration camps to be \"reeducated\". On July 1, 1974 the group was officially banned and their \"churches\" closed. Following the ban members who refused military service were imprisoned for sentences of three years and it was reported that members were also imprisoned because of their children's refusal to salute the flag.\n\nIn Eritrea, the government stripped Jehovah's Witnesses of their civil and political rights in 1994 after their refusal to engage in voting and military service. Members of all ages have been arrested for participating in religious meetings. On 24 September 1994, Paulos Eyassu, Negede Teklemariam, and Isaac Mogos were arrested, imprisoned without trial, and remain imprisoned. As of January 2019, 53 Witnesses were imprisoned, one since 2001. International rights groups are aware of the situation of Jehovah's Witnesses in Eritrea and have repeatedly called for Eritrean authorities to end the persecution. Four are reported to have died in prison due to maltreatment.\n\nPrior to World War II, the French government banned the \"Association of Jehovah's Witnesses in France\", and ordered that the French offices of the Watch Tower Society be vacated. After the war, Jehovah's Witnesses in France renewed their operations. In December 1952, France's Minister of the Interior banned \"The Watchtower\" magazine, citing its position on military service. The ban was lifted on November 26, 1974.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the French government included Jehovah's Witnesses on its list of \"cults\", and governmental ministers made derogatory public statements about Jehovah's Witnesses. Despite its century of activity in the country, France's Ministry of Finance opposed official recognition of the denomination; it was not until June 23, 2000 that France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses qualify as a religion under French law. France's Ministry of the Interior sought to collect 60% of donations made to the denomination's entities; Witnesses called the taxation \"confiscatory\" and appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On June 30, 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that France's actions violated the religious freedom of Jehovah's Witnesses by demanding 58 million euros in taxes.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses in France have reported hundreds of criminal attacks against their adherents and places of worship.\n\nDuring the ban of \"The Watchtower\" in France, publication of the magazine continued in various French territories. In French Polynesia, the magazine was covertly published under the name, \"La Sentinelle\", though it was later learned that \"The Watchtower\" had not been banned locally. In Réunion, the magazine was published under the name, \"Bulletin intérieur\".\n\nIn 1996, one year after Georgia adopted its post-USSR Constitution, the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs began a campaign to detain tons of religious literature belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses. Government officials refused permits for Jehovah's Witnesses to organize assemblies, and law enforcement officials dispersed legal assemblies. In September 2000, \"Georgian police and security officials fired blank anti-tank shells and used force to disperse an outdoor gathering of some 700 Jehovah's Witnesses in the town of Natuliki in northwestern Georgia on 8 September, AP and Caucasus Press reported.\"\n\nIn cases when the instigators were formally charged, prosecution was impeded by a lack of cooperation by government and law enforcement. In 2004, Forum 18 News Service referred to the period since 1999 as a \"five-year reign of terror\" against Jehovah's Witnesses and certain other religious minorities. Amnesty International noted: \"Jehovah's Witnesses have frequently been a target for violence … in Georgia … In many of the incidents police are said to have failed to protect the believers, or even to have participated in physical and verbal abuse.\" Individual Witnesses have fled Georgia seeking religious refugee status in other nations.\n\nOn May 3, 2007, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against the government of Georgia for its toleration of religious violence toward Jehovah's Witnesses and ordered the victims be compensated for moral damages and legal costs.\n\nOn October 7, 2014, The European Court of Human Rights, giving its judgement concerning violence against Jehovah's Witnesses in Georgia in the years 2000-2001, unanimously held that Georgia's state officials, in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, Articles 3, 9 & 14, had either directly participated in those attacks or had tolerated violence by private individuals against members of this religious group.\n\nDuring 1931 and 1932, more than 2000 legal actions were instigated against Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany and members of the group were dismissed from employment. Persecution intensified following Adolf Hitler's appointment as chancellor in 1933 and continued until 1945. A \"Declaration of Facts\" was issued at a Jehovah's Witness convention in Berlin on June 25, 1933, asserting the group's political neutrality and calling for an end to government opposition. More than 2.1 million copies of the statement were distributed throughout Germany, but its distribution prompted a new wave of persecution against German Witnesses, whose refusal to give the Hitler salute, join Nazi organizations or perform military service demonstrated their opposition to the totalitarian ideology of National Socialism.\n\nOn October 4, 1934, congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany sent telegrams of protest and warning to Hitler. According to one eyewitness account Hitler was shown a number of telegrams protesting against the Third Reich's persecution of the Bible Students. The eyewitness, Karl Wittig, reported: \"Hitler jumped to his feet and with clenched fists hysterically screamed: 'This brood will be exterminated in Germany!' Four years after this discussion I was able, by my own observations, to convince myself … that Hitler's outburst of anger was not just an idle threat. No other group of prisoners of the named concentration-camps was exposed to the sadism of the SS-soldiery in such a fashion as the Bible Students were. It was a sadism marked by an unending chain of physical and mental tortures, the likes of which no language in the world can express.\"\n\nAbout 10,000 Witnesses were imprisoned, including 2000 sent to concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed. From 1935 Gestapo officers offered members a document to sign indicating renouncement of their faith, submission to state authority, and support of the German military. Historian Detlef Garbe says a \"relatively high number\" of people signed the statement before the war, but \"extremely low numbers\" of Bible Student prisoners did so in concentration camps in later years.\n\nDespite more than a century of conspicuous activity in the country, Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany were not granted legal recognition until March 25, 2005, in Berlin; in 2006 Germany's Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG) in Leipzig extended the local decision to apply nationwide.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses' Office of Public Information has documented a number of mob attacks in India. It states that these instances of violence \"reveal the country's hostility toward its own citizens who are Christians.\" There have been reports that police assist mob attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses or lay charges against the Witnesses while failing to charge other participants involved. In the city of Davangere on December 20, 2010 a mob confronted two female Witnesses. The mob broke into the home of one of the Witnesses where they had taken refuge. Property was damaged and one of the Witnesses was assaulted. When the police arrived, the Witnesses were arrested and charged with blasphemy.\n\nIn another incident, on December 6, 2011, three Witnesses were attacked by a mob in Madikeri, in the state of Karnataka. The male Witness \"was kicked and pummeled by the mob\" and then the mob dragged them towards a nearby temple; while making lewd remarks, the mob \"tried to tear the clothes off of the female Witnesses.\" According to the report, the police came and \"took the three Witnesses to the police station and filed charges against them rather than the mob.\" During a July 2012 incident, a group of fifteen men assaulted four Witnesses in Madikeri. The group was taken to a police station and charged with \"insulting the religion or religious beliefs of another class\" before being released on bail.\n\nIn 1967, thousands of Witnesses in Malawi were beaten and killed by police and citizens for refusing to purchase political party cards and become members of the Malawi Congress Party. While their stand of not involving themselves in politics during the time of the old Colonial government was seen as an act of resistance their continued non-involvement with the new independent government was viewed as treasonous. The organization was declared illegal in the penal code and the foreign members in the country were expelled. Persecution, both economic and physical, was intensified after a September 1972 Malawi Congress Party meeting which stated, in part, that \"all Witnesses should be dismissed from their employment; any firm that failed to comply would have its license cancelled.\" By November 1973 some 21,000 Jehovah's Witnesses had fled to the neighboring country of Zambia. In 1993, during the transition to a multiparty system and a change in leadership, the government's ban on the organization was lifted in the country.\n\nRussian anti-extremism laws were extended to non-violent groups in 2007 and Jehovah's Witnesses have been officially banned from the port city of Taganrog since 2009, after a local court ruled the organization guilty of inciting religious hatred by \"propagating the exclusivity and supremacy\" of their religious beliefs.\n\nOn December 8, 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the ruling of the lower courts which pronounced 34 pieces of Jehovah's Witness literature extremist, including their magazine \"The Watchtower\", in the Russian language. Jehovah's Witnesses claim that this ruling affirms a misapplication of a federal law on anti-extremism. The ruling upheld the confiscation of property of Jehovah's Witnesses in Taganrog, and may set a precedent for similar cases in other areas of Russia, as well as placing literature of Jehovah's Witnesses on a list of literature unacceptable throughout Russia. The chairman of the presiding committee of the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, Vasily Kalin, said: \"I am very concerned that this decision will open a new era of opposition against Jehovah's Witnesses, whose right to meet in peace, to access religious literature and to share the Christian hope contained in the Gospels, is more and more limited.\" On December 1, 2015 a Rostov Regional Court convicted 16 Jehovah's Witnesses of practising extremism in Taganrog, with five given -year suspended sentences and the remainder issued fines they were not required to pay.\n\nOn May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses. Russian customs officials in the city of Vyborg held up a shipment of 2,013 Russian-language copies of Bibles on July 13, 2015. Customs authorities confiscated three of the Bibles, sent them to an \"expert\" to study the Bibles to determine whether they contained \"extremist\" language, and impounded the rest of the shipment.\n\nOn July 21, 2015, the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice added Jehovah's Witnesses' official website to the Federal List of Extremist Materials thereby making it a criminal offense to promote the website from within the country and requiring internet providers throughout Russia to block access to the site.\n\nOn March 23, 2017, the Russian News Agency TASS reported that Russia's Justice Ministry had suspended the activities of the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia due to extremist activities. On April 4, 2017 UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression David Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur on Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association Maina Kiai, and UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief Ahmed Shaheed condemned Russia's desire to ban Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nOn April 20, 2017, The Supreme Court of Russia issued a verdict upholding the claim from the country's Justice Ministry that Jehovah's Witnesses' activity violated laws on \"extremism.\" The ruling liquidates the group's Russian headquarters in St. Petersburg and all of its 395 local religious organizations. Thus banning their activity, and ordering their property to be seized by the state. This is the first time that a court has ruled that a registered national centralized religious organisation is \"extremist\" and banned. Many countries and international organizations have spoken out against Russia's religious abuses of Jehovah's Witnesses. Leaders of various denominations have also spoken out against Russia's decision to ban Jehovah's Witnesses. An article in \"Newsweek\" stated, \"Russia's decision to ban Jehovah's Witnesses in the country shows the 'paranoia' of Vladimir Putin's government, according to the chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).\" The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum also expressed deep concern over Russia's treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nIn May 2017, armed Federal Security Services (FSB) officers arrested Dennis Christensen, a 46 year old Danish citizen, at a hall in Oryol on charges related to extremism. On February 6, 2019, he was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nIn 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses on the grounds that its members refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state. Singapore has banned all written materials (including Bibles) published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah's Witnesses. A person in possession of banned literature can be fined up to S$2,000 (US$1,333) and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction.\n\nIn February 1995, Singapore police raided private homes where group members were holding religious meetings, in an operation codenamed \"Operation Hope\". Officers seized Bibles, religious literature, documents and computers, and eventually brought charges against 69 Jehovah's Witnesses, many of whom went to jail. In March 1995, 74-year-old Yu Nguk Ding was arrested for carrying two \"undesirable publications\"—one of them a Bible printed by the Watch Tower Society.\n\nIn 1996, eighteen Jehovah's Witnesses were convicted for unlawfully meeting in a Singapore apartment and were given sentences from one to four weeks in jail. Canadian Queen's Counsel Glen How flew to Singapore to defend the Jehovah's Witnesses and argued that the restrictions against the Jehovah's Witnesses violated their constitutional rights. Then-Chief Justice Yong Pung How questioned How's sanity, accused him of \"living in a cartoon world\" and referred to \"funny, cranky religious groups\" before denying the appeal. In 1998, two Jehovah's Witnesses were charged in a Singapore court for possessing and distributing banned religious publications.\n\nIn 1998 a Jehovah's Witness lost a lawsuit against a government school for wrongful dismissal for refusing to sing the national anthem or salute the flag. In March 1999, the Court of Appeals denied his appeal. In 2000, public secondary schools indefinitely suspended at least fifteen Jehovah's Witness students for refusing to sing the national anthem or participate in the flag ceremony. In April 2001, one public school teacher, also a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, resigned after being threatened with dismissal for refusing to participate in singing the national anthem.\n\nSingapore authorities have seized Jehovah's Witnesses' literature on various occasions from individuals attempting to cross the Malaysia–Singapore border. In thirteen cases, authorities warned the Jehovah's Witnesses, but did not press charges.\n\nAs of January 2019, there were 9 members of Jehovah's Witnesses incarcerated for refusal to carry out mandatory military service. The initial sentence for failure to comply is 15 months' imprisonment, with an additional 24 months for a second refusal. Failure to perform annual military reserve duty, which is required of all those who have completed their initial two-year obligation, results in a 40-day sentence, with a 12-month sentence after four refusals. There is no alternative civilian service for Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nBeginning on June 7, 1967, the South African government passed the Defense Amendment Bill, making it compulsory for all white males of eligible age to participate in the armed forces. The background to this change in the law was the rapid escalation of the Border War in Southern Africa, with Communist-bloc countries increasingly sending men and material to Africa, and covert support from America and Israel to assist South Africa in stemming Communism and African Nationalism. Beyond this proxy war, South Africa's security situation internally was also changing drastically, as there was increasing resistance to the Apartheid government activity in the form of protest, riots, bombings, and assaults on remote locations such as farms in the isolated North of the country.\n\nConscription brought Jehovah's Witnesses into conflict with the government, and young men of eligible age who refused were punished by being sentenced to military detention barracks. Sentences lasted for no less than 12 months, with repeat convictions in some cases.\n\nAccording to the Survey of Race Relations in South Africa of 1974, during 1973, 158 Jehovah's Witnesses (and one sun worshiper) were sentenced \"for refusing on religious grounds to render service or undergo training.\" In the first half of 1974, 120 Jehovah's Witnesses and two Christadelphians were sentenced.\n\nConscription was officially ended in late August 1993. By this time, the Constitution of South Africa had been adjusted to allow for alternative civilian service instead of military service.\n\nIn July 2017 the Supreme Court of South Ossetia ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses were an extreme organization. The court declared a penalty of ten years imprisonment for \"any religious activities such as assembly and distributing literature.\"\n\nJehovah's Witnesses did not have a significant presence in the Soviet Union prior to 1939 when the Soviet Union forcibly incorporated eastern Poland, Moldavia, and Lithuania, each of which had a Jehovah's Witness movement. Although never large in number (estimated by the KGB to be 20,000 in 1968), the Jehovah's Witnesses became one of the most persecuted religious groups in the Soviet Union during the post-World War II era. Members were arrested or deported; some were put in Soviet concentration camps. Witnesses in Moldavian SSR were deported to Tomsk Oblast; members from other regions of the Soviet Union were deported to Irkutsk Oblast. KGB officials, who were tasked with dissolving the Jehovah's Witness movement, were disturbed to discover that the Witnesses continued to practice their faith even within the labor camps.\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs, Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov proposed the deportation of the Jehovah's Witnesses to Stalin in October 1950. A resolution was voted by the Council of Minister and an order was issued by the Ministry for State Security in March 1951. The Moldavian SSR passed a decree \"on the confiscation and selling of the property of individuals banished from the territory of the Moldavian SSR\", which included the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nIn April 1951, over 9,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia under a plan called \"Operation North\". The Soviet government was so disturbed by the Jehovah's Witnesses who continued to receive religious literature smuggled from Brooklyn that the KGB was authorized to send agents to infiltrate the Brooklyn headquarters.\n\nIn September 1965, a decree of the Presidium of the USSR Council of Ministers canceled the \"special settlement\" restriction of Jehovah's Witnesses, though the decree, signed by Anastas Mikoyan, stated that there would be no compensation for confiscated property. However, Jehovah's Witnesses remained the subject of state persecution due to their ideology being classified as anti-Soviet.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee has indicated that Jehovah's Witnesses in Turkmenistan have been prosecuted and imprisoned for refusing to perform compulsory military service, despite Turkmenistan's constitution guaranteeing the right to \"practice any religion alone or in association with others\" and the right to \"freedom of conviction and the free expression of those convictions\". The UN committee noted, \"The State party should take all necessary measures to review its legislation with a view to providing for alternative military service. The State party should also ensure that the law clearly stipulates that individuals have the right to conscientious objection to military service. Furthermore, the State party should halt all prosecutions of individuals who refuse to perform military service on grounds of conscience and release those individuals who are currently serving prison sentences.\"\n\nAccording to the US Department of State, Turkmenistan's Ministry of Justice described Jehovah's Witnesses as foreign and dangerous. The US State Department also stated that the Turkmenistan government imposes restrictions on the freedom of Jehovah's Witness parents (and members of various other religious groups) to raise their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. In 2003, Witnesses' religious literature was confiscated, members of Jehovah's Witnesses were denied exit visas, and others were stopped after crossing a border and forced to return. In 2004, five Jehovah's Witnesses were stopped and prevented from boarding a flight to another country because their names where included on a \"black list\" of citizens prohibited from leaving the country. \nIn 2015, a Jehovah's Witness in Turkmenistan was sentenced to four years in prison for allegedly inciting hatred at a religious meeting held in a private home, and other attendees were fined. As of January 2019, members were imprisoned.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, some US states passed laws that made it illegal for Jehovah's Witnesses to distribute their literature, and children of Jehovah's Witnesses in some states were banned from attending state schools.\n\nThe persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses for their refusal to salute the flag became known as the \"Flag-Salute Cases\". Their refusal to salute the flag became considered as a test of the liberties for which the flag stands, namely the freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The Supreme Court found that the United States, by making the flag salute compulsory in \"Minersville School District v. Gobitis\" (1940), was impinging upon the individual's right to worship as one chooses — a violation of the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause in the constitution. Justice Frankfurter, speaking on behalf of the 8-to-1 majority view against the Witnesses, stated that the interests of \"inculcating patriotism was of sufficient importance to justify a relatively minor infringement on religious belief.\" The result of the ruling was a wave of persecution. Lillian Gobitas, the mother of the schoolchildren involved in the decision said, \"It was like open season on Jehovah's Witnesses.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union reported that by the end of 1940, \"more than 1,500 Witnesses in the United States had been victimized in 335 separate attacks\". Such attacks included beatings, being tarred and feathered, hanged, shot, maimed, and even castrated, as well as other acts of violence. As reports of these attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses continued, \"several justices changed their minds, and in \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" (1943), the Court declared that the state could not impinge on the First Amendment by compelling the observance of rituals.\"\n\nIn 1943, after a drawn-out litigation process by Watch Tower Society lawyers in state courts and lower federal courts, the Supreme Court ruled that public school officials could not force Jehovah's Witnesses and other students to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In 1946 and 1953 Supreme Court decisions were handed down establishing their right to be exempted from military service.\n\n"}

{"id": "2303867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303867", "title": "Trident Studios", "text": "Trident Studios\n\nTrident Studios was a British recording facility, located at 17 St Anne's Court in London's Soho district between 1968 and 1981. It was constructed in 1967 by Norman Sheffield, drummer of the 1960s group the Hunters, and his brother Barry. \n\n\"My Name is Jack\" by Manfred Mann was recorded at Trident in March 1968, and helped launch the studio's reputation. Later that year, the Beatles recorded their song \"Hey Jude\" there and part of their self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\"). Other well-known albums and songs recorded at Trident include Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind\", David Bowie's \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\", and Queen's albums \"Queen\", \"Queen II\" and \"Sheer Heart Attack\".\n\nOther artists recorded at Trident included the Bee Gees, Carly Simon, Chris de Burgh, Frank Zappa, Genesis, Brand X, James Taylor, Joan Armatrading, Joe Cocker, Harry Nilsson, Kiss, Tygers of Pan Tang, Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Marc Almond, Marc and the Mambas, Soft Cell, the Rolling Stones, Thin Lizzy, Tina Turner, T-Rex, Van der Graaf Generator, Yes and John Entwistle.\n\nThe Sheffield brothers had a relaxed working attitude, but also emphasised high standards of audio engineering. The studio's state-of-the-art recording equipment helped attract many major artists to record there.\n\nIn mid-1968, Trident Studios was the first in the UK to use Dolby noise reduction, and employ an eight-track reel-to-reel recording deck.\n\nWhile Abbey Road Studios still only used four-track at the time, Trident's Ampex eight-track machine drew the Beatles on 31 July 1968 to record their song \"Hey Jude\". Paul McCartney later said about recording the track at Trident: \"Words cannot describe the pleasure of listening back to the final mix of 'Hey Jude' on four giant Tannoy speakers which dwarfed everything else in the room ...\" The band also recorded some songs for their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the White Album) at Trident – \"Dear Prudence\", \"Honey Pie\", \"Savoy Truffle\" and \"Martha My Dear\" – and in February 1969, they first recorded \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" there for the album \"Abbey Road\". John Lennon and Yoko Ono later returned with the Plastic Ono Band to record \"Cold Turkey\" featuring Eric Clapton on lead guitar.\n\nMany of the Beatles' Apple Records artists used Trident Studios, including Badfinger, Billy Preston, Mary Hopkin, Jackie Lomax and James Taylor. Part of George Harrison's triple album \"All Things Must Pass\", containing the hit \"My Sweet Lord\", and Ringo Starr's \"It Don't Come Easy\", were also recorded there. Harry Nilsson recorded \"Without You\" at Trident, and portions of several of his 1970s albums.\n\nThe history of the Sheffield brothers and Trident Studios is also linked to the early discovery and success of the rock band Queen. In 1972, Trident Studios started two record production companies, one of which (Neptune Productions) initially signed three artists, Mark Ashton, Eugene Wallace and Queen. The agreements with the artists were for recording and publishing, but Queen had no management, so they insisted that Trident also take on that responsibility. Trident, initially reluctant, eventually agreed and Queen signed an agreement with Trident Recording, Publishing and Management, on 1 November 1972.\n\nThe Management at the time claimed the deal allowed the band full access to the studio's cutting edge facilities, and supported them by providing the best producers and engineers - so long as the foundations of the band's first album \"Queen\" were recorded 'off peak'. Roger Taylor later quoted these early off-peak studio hours as \"gold dust\".\n\nAfter the album was completed the Sheffield brothers had great difficulty finding a record label to take on the album and release it. Finally, eight months later, the brothers decided to take on the risk and fund the release themselves and Queen released their self-titled first album under the Trident label in a license deal with EMI Records in the UK and Elektra Records in the US. Trident subsequently released \"Queen II\", \"Sheer Heart Attack\" and \"A Night at the Opera\" under this same arrangement. After the band left Trident, they signed directly with EMI and Elektra.\n\nThe 2018 Queen Biopic Bohemian Rhapsody featured a dramatisation of the studio in the film, during the making of Seven Seas of Rhye.\n\nIn March 1968, Manfred Mann recorded Trident's first number one at the studio, the single \"My Name Is Jack\". From 1968 to 1981, some of the most reputed artists used the studios for their recordings, including David Bowie, Elton John, Marc Bolan/T.Rex, Carly Simon, Frank Zappa, the Rolling Stones, Free, Genesis, Lou Reed, Joan Armatrading, Black Sabbath, Lindisfarne, Dusty Springfield, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Krisma, Jeff Beck/Rod Stewart and other artists. Elton John's \"Your Song\" and Carly Simon's \"You're So Vain\" were both engineered at Trident by Robin Geoffrey Cable, who later went on to produce two albums for The Dickies.\n\nTony Stratton-Smith's Charisma Records was also one of the most regular clients of the studios during the 1970s. Genesis recorded several of their most renowned albums there, including \"Trespass\" (1970), \"Nursery Cryme\" (1971) and \"A Trick of the Tail\" (1976). The jazz fusion band Brand X recorded their debut studio album \"Unorthodox Behaviour\" here (1976). Other artists from the label who recorded at Trident were Van der Graaf Generator, Peter Hammill, Lindisfarne and Peter Gabriel. Charisma's first Van der Graaf Generator release, \"The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other\", was recorded at Trident from 11 to 14 December 1969. Most of the album was recorded on eight-track, but the last song, \"After the Flood\", was recorded on 16. Trident was also among the first studios in the UK to obtain a 16-track machine.\n\nThe Trident A Range consoles were originally designed and built as an in house project by Malcolm Toft who was chief recording engineer at Trident and Barry Porter who was in charge of studio maintenance. Other studios heard about it and placed orders for consoles and Trident Audio Developments was formed with Malcolm Toft as managing director. Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles was one of the early recipients of one of the first production models, and ultimately purchased three new from Trident and one from a broker at a later time. David Bowie, Rod Stewart, and Frank Sinatra are among the early artists who first recorded hit records on Cherokee’s first 'A' Range console.\n\n\"Though it had a very limited run, the Trident A Range console gained a reputation for its very distinct and pleasant sound with a very \"musical\" EQ section. Along with channel strips from early Neve and Helios consoles, original Trident A Range modules have kept a healthy resale value and are much sought after by engineers who like to combine old-school analogue gear with cutting-edge digital recording technology.\"\n\nTrident also gained a reputation for the sound of its piano, which can be heard on the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\", Elton John's \"Your Song\", Queen's \"Killer Queen\" and many other tracks. It was a handmade C. Bechstein concert-sized instrument that was over one hundred years old.\n\nTrident Studios was sold in December 1981. It was bought by its senior engineer, Stephen Short, along with three other investors. In 1986, Short bought out the other investors and opened Trident 2 which was opened in 1983 and the investors were J.P. Illiesco and Rusty Egan. There were also another group of producers and investors who tried to buy Trident in the 1980s after its initial closure headed by Neville Kernick-Nixon, Flood and John Keating, the former then opened The Mad House later known as The Music Station.\n\nThe original Trident mixing desk also survived, and was purchased in the early 1980s from the studio's owners by songwriter and former Cure bassist Phil Thornalley. It is now housed in Thornalley's own recording studio, Swamp Studios in north-west London. The Swamp is actually based around the Trident Tri‑mix desk.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, a British Plaque Trust permanent blue plaque was unveiled outside the building at 17 St Anne's Court, London in the recognition of the multiple David Bowie albums recorded there.\n\nThe following is a partial list of work either recorded, mixed or mastered at Trident Studios between 1968 and 1981, taken from the timeline on the Trident Studios official website and edited.\n"}
{"id": "2303875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303875", "title": "Blood on the Moon", "text": "Blood on the Moon\n\nBlood on the Moon is a 1948 RKO black-and-white \"psychological\" western directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Mitchum, Barbara Bel Geddes, and Robert Preston. The film has cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. The film has many film noir elements. It was shot in California, and some of the more scenic shots at Red Rock Crossing, Sedona, Arizona. The picture is based on the novel \"Gunman's Chance\" by Luke Short.\n\nCowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend.\n\nRiling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get $10,000 for his part in the swindle.\n\nLufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men cause the cattle to stampede and scatter back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a young man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.\n\nTo buy time, Garry persuades Pindalest, who is unaware of his break with Riling, to send a messenger to the government to extend the deadline. Garry then takes Pindalest prisoner. Riling and his gang track them down. Garry flees to the cabin of Kris Barden, the father of the young man killed in the stampede; they are joined by Amy. A gunfight erupts. Though wounded earlier, Garry sneaks out at night, dispatches Riling's men and knocks out Pindalest. Then he and his old friend face each other. Riling is fatally wounded. Pindalest is taken into custody, and Garry decides to give up his wandering ways, much to Amy's delight.\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave the film a good review and lauded Robert Mitchum's acting and Lilly Hayward's screenplay:\n\n...\"Blood on the Moon\" still stands out from run-of-the-range action dramas. The reason is obvious enough. This picture has a sound, sensible story to tell and, besides, it is well acted. Robert Mitchum carries the burden of the film and his acting is superior all the way...Lillie Hayward's screen play, taken from a novel by Luke Short, is solidly constructed and by not over-emphasizing Jim Garry's inherent honesty, she has permitted Mr. Mitchum to illuminate a character that is reasonable and most always interesting. The same can be said of the rancher's daughter, whom Miss Bel Geddes represents. Others who give worthy help include Walter Brennan, Mr. Preston, Phyllis Thaxter, Frank Faylen and Tom Tully. And a word should be said, too, for the direction by Robert Wise. A comparative newcomer to the directorial ranks, he has managed to keep the atmosphere of this leisurely paced film charged with impending violence.\n\nThe film was also reviewed favorably by \"Variety\" magazine:\n\n\"Blood on the Moon\" is a terse, tightly-drawn western drama. There's none of the formula approach to its story telling. Picture captures the crisp style used by Luke Short in writing his western novels...Picture's pace has a false sense of leisureliness that points up several tough moments of action. There is a deadly knock-down and drag-out fist fight between Mitchum and Preston; a long chase across snow-covered mountains and the climax gun battle between Preston's henchmen and Mitchum, Brennan and Bel Geddes that are loaded with suspense wallop.\n\n"}

While Iran's population grew at a rate of more than 3% per year between 1956 and 1986, the growth rate began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s after the government initiated a major population control program. By 2007 the growth rate had declined to 0.7 percent per year, with a birth rate of 17 per 1,000 persons and a death rate of 6 per 1,000. Reports by the UN show birth control policies in Iran to be effective with the country topping the list of greatest fertility decreases. UN's Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs says that between 1975 and 1980, the total fertility number was 6.5. The projected level for Iran's 2005 to 2010 birth rate is fewer than two.\n\nIn late July 2012, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei described Iran's contraceptive services as \"wrong,\" and Iranian authorities are slashing birth-control programs in what one Western newspaper (USA Today) describes as a \"major reversal\" of its long standing policy. Whether program cuts and high-level appeals for bigger families will be successful is still unclear.\n\nAccording to Dr Malek Afzali, Iran's deputy minister for research and technology in the Ministry of Health, before the Islamic Revolution, there was family planning but \"people did not accept it.\"\n\nThe Tehran Declaration of 1967 claimed that family planning was a human right, and arranged for the creation of both a Family Planning Division as part of the Ministry of Health and a High Council for the Coordination of Family Planning. These programs were responsible for 2,000 nationwide clinics distributing forms of birth control\n\nFollowing the creation of the Islamic Republic; family planning clinics of the Shah were dismantled \"on the grounds that Islam and Iran needed a large population.\" The Majlis passed many pro-natalist laws during this era,like the lowering of marriage age to nine years old for girls and fourteen years old for boys, the legalization of polygamy, the artificial inflation of birth control pill price from one hundred rials to one thousand rials per pack, and the creation of the Iranian Marriage foundation which provided newlyweds with furniture to ensure more people could get married and reproduce\n\nIran's population boom started before the 1979 Islamic Revolution (in 1976 the fertility rate was 6 children/woman). Data show that Iran's population doubled in just 20 years—from 27 million in 1968 to 55 million in 1988.\n\nAt one point in the 1980s estimates predicted that Iran's population would reach 108 million by the year 2006.\n\nFollowing the war with Iraq, the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, and taking office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in 1989, a sharp change was made in the Iran's population policy. Realizing \"the costs of this burgeoning population were going to far exceed its capacity to provide adequate food, education, housing and employment\", Iran's government \"declared that Islam favored families with only two children\", as one historian put it. Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives—pills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.\n\nIn 1993, Parliament passed further legislation withdrawing food coupons, paid maternity leave, and social welfare subsidies after the third child for government and para-government employees. The backlash to this law was severe and application of it remains limited. Birth control classes were required before a couple could get married. Dozens of mobile teams were sent to remote parts of the country to offer free vasectomies and tubal ligations.\n\nBy 2001, an Iranian condom factory produced more than 70 million condoms a year, \"packaged in French or English to suggest that they are imported\", according to a foreign reporter. By this time Iran's population growth rate had dropped from an all-time high of 3.2% in 1986 to just 1.2%, one of the fastest drops ever recorded. In reducing its population growth to this level—a rate that is only slightly higher than that of the United States—Iran emerged as a model for other countries that want to lessen the risk of overpopulation. In 2007 Iran's Total Fertility Rate had dropped to 1.71 with a net out-migration of 4.29 ‰ (and population 65 M).\n\nExplaining the change in religious doctrine on population during a birth control workshop in 1995, Deputy Health Minister Husein Malek-Afzali stated \"Islam is a flexible religion\".\n\nA call for a reversal of Iran's existing policy of \"two children is enough\" came in October 2006 due to perilously low fertility rates in Iran that had started to cause negative population growth as in other low-fertility countries. Iran's President Ahmadinejad called for an increase in Iran's population from 70 to 120 million. \nCritics reacted by noting that Iran was struggling with surging inflation and rising unemployment, estimated at around 11%, and that a population of 120 million could mean a shortage of fresh water limiting \"the country’s domestic agricultural and industrial development options,\" and that some countries \"triumph\" over others because of superior \"knowledge, technology, wealth, welfare, and security\", not population size.\n\nAhmadinejad's call for a higher birth rate reminded some of the demand of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 for an increased population, which was eventually reversed in response to the resultant economic strain.\n\nOn 25 July 2012, Supreme Leader Khamenei stated that Iran's contraceptive policy made sense 20 years ago, \"but its continuation in later years was wrong ... Scientific and experts studies show that we will face population aging and reduction (in population) if the birth-control policy continues.\"\n\nDeputy health minister Ali Reza Mesdaghinia, was quoted in the semiofficial Fars news agency on 29 July that population control programs \"belonged to the past,\" and that \"there is no plan to keep number of the children at one or two. Families should decide about it by themselves. In our culture, having a large number of children has been a tradition. In the past families had five or six children. … The culture still exists in the rural areas. We should go back to our genuine culture.\" How successful the government will be in surmounting hurdles of changing ideas in society about the role of women and the family, and family worries about money and employment, remains to be seen.\n\nAs of 2014, measures to reverse the declining birth rate include: replacing public-health slogans that used to praise “Fewer kids, better life” with billboards that show large, happy families juxtaposed with sad small families; cutting budgets for subsidized condoms and family planning; increasing already generous paternity and maternity leave; and seeking to enact a bill that would make vasectomies and tubectomies, which were free of charge until 2012, treated like abortions - punishable by a jail term of up to five years and payment of diyya (blood money). However, others have suggested that a large youthful population with low job prospects could in fact create greater problems in the future than an aging population.\n\n\n"}

He attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, before moving to New York City to attend the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in the early 1970s. In 1980 Villard moved to Los Angeles and soon started landing roles on television and in movies. He also continued performing on stage until the end of his career.\n\nVillard appeared throughout his career on television, in feature films, and on stage around the country. He was featured in situation comedies, episodic TV series, and had leading roles in lower and mid-range budgeted features.

In February 1994, Villard made an unprecedented appearance on \"Entertainment Tonight\", acknowledging to \"...more than 13 million viewers that he was gay, that he had AIDS, and that he needed some help.\"\n\nAccording to a \"POZ magazine\" profile in December of that year Villard said, \"An awful lot of people suddenly wouldn't let me in the door for auditions. I started speaking a couple of months ago about living with AIDS and having hope,\" he said. \"It feels a little more useful than things (I've done) in the past.\" He went on to explain that since his appearance on \"E.T.\", a whole other group of people had come forward to welcome him. Bill Melamed, Villard's manager added: \"I'm particularly proud of him. The reality is, acting is a lousy business... He made a decision that was courageous in any walk of life, but it doesn't surprise me. He has one of the most open spirits.\"\n\nOn November 14, 1994, Villard died of AIDS-related pneumonia. He was survived by his parents, Ron and Diane Villard, twin brothers Timothy and Terry, sister Susan, and his partner Scott Chambliss.\n\nAs a tribute to him, a non-profit foundation was created by his partner Chambliss, close friend Karen Kaye, and his friend and chiropractor Cheryl Revkin. The \"Tom Villard Foundation\" was a Silver Lake community-based effort which engaged local businesses to provide free goods and services for community members living with AIDS.

That in Knightsbridge was a six-acre site until its demolition in the 1830s.\n\nRutland House on Aldersgate Street, near Charterhouse Square in the City of London, close to Smithfield Market, was leased by the playwright and impresario Sir William Davenant (1606–1668).\n\nIn 1656, freshly released from imprisonment, Davenant turned a room of the house into what was, at first, a private theatre performing his own plays. Soon the performances were advertised and semi-open to the public at a cost of 5 shillings a head, a figure that ensured that only persons of quality would be able to attend. The reason for Rutland House being used rather than a conventional theatre was to overcome the laws of censorship which operated in all public places following the closures of all public theatres by the Puritan government of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nThe house seems to have been not totally suitable for theatrical use; however, a low narrow hall, or salon, at the rear of the house was adapted for the performances. Rather than sitting in comfort, the audience had to sit on improvised benches, and so confined was the space available that the benches had to be arranged at an angle to the small stage to accommodate the large audiences who came. The small stage, described by Davenant as a \"Cup-board stage\", was adorned with gold and purple curtains. Above the stage in what was contemporarily described as a \"louver hole\" was concealed a small orchestra.\n\nDavenant had seen Italian opera sung in Paris; this inspired him to conceive a cunning plan: as the Puritan government had no objection to music, only drama, he obtained permission to stage a performance of his opera \"The Siege of Rhodes\", to be sung in \"recitative music\". Thus, the first English opera was performed at Rutland House in May 1656 , simultaneously overcoming the prohibition of drama. The Rutland House production also included England's first professional actress, Mrs. Coleman and was later transferred to the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane.\n\nDavenant established at least two other \"private performance houses\" in Lincoln's Inn Fields and Drury Lane. After Davenant opened more conventional theatres, he continued to use Rutland House to preview new productions, to gauge audience reaction.\n\nThis was built for John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. It enjoyed at first a rectangular plot of in Knightsbridge London, however by its destruction had sold off the north-east quarter for two large houses, one of which, Kent House, likely already served as a subsidiary. \n\nThe house stood from the mid 18th century until it was demolished in 1836.\n\nRutland Gate, a double-square of grand houses around two tree-planted narrow communal greens was engineered and erected on its site, save for №s 48C to 65 which come from the land to the west. Many of its buildings are listed.\n"}

The natives of Obelisk welcome the expedition, but two members, Hiroshi and Itoko, venture into a forbidden area, despite the pleas of a native boy named Saki. They enter a cavern blocked by a fallen statue and find a giant egg, out of which hatches a baby monster, a \"bird-lizard\", referred to as \"Gappa\". The natives plead with the skeptical scientists not to take the baby away, lest it anger the baby's parents.

The film has been released on DVD by various companies including Alpha Video, Mill Creek Entertainment, Tokyo Shock and Image Entertainment.\n\nIn contemporary reviews, \"Variety\" stated that the creature Gappa makes an \"auspicious debut and reveals itself as \"best monster\" so far\". \"Variety\" concluded that \"these are the only Japanese monsters one might like to see again\" and that \"Most effects are well done, a few superb\" noting the destruction of Atami as one of the highlights.\n\nIn retrospective reviews, Phil Hardy discussed the film in his book \"Science Fiction\" (1984). The review complemented the film, noting that \"the effects are excellent and the script is worthy of a witty children's comedy.\" Stuart Galbraith IV described the film as an unauthorized remake of the 1961 British film \"Gorgo\". Galbraith described the human characters as \"colorless reporters and scientists\" and that \"none of the actors is especially appealing.\" Galbraith commented on Akira Watanabe's effects, opining that they were \"okay but lack the perfectionist drive of Eiji Tsuburaya's work.\"\n\n\n"}

While at MGM, Thaxter married James T. Aubrey, Jr., who later became president of CBS-TV and MGM. They divorced in 1962. They had two children: Skye Aubrey, an actress; and James Aubrey.\n\nA Republican, she supported the campaign of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election.

The stories take place in a mythical West Texas town changed by a release of atomic power and mystic forces.\n\nThe lead character is Ida Red, a seemingly normal 16-year-old orphan who develops amazing mutant powers. Through her heroism Ida later becomes sheriff of the strange town.\n\nIn creating the \"Mutant, Texas\" comics, Paul Dini wanted to create a setting with no narrative limitations: \"When I first started tinkering with the idea of a town full of mutants, I saw it as a limitless playground. Anything goes here.\". He also stated, \"[W]ith Ida, I'm creating another twist on the fun superheroine characters that I'm known for contributing to \"Batman Adventures\" and other places.

The town was formerly known as Mystic until a freak accident in 1959 involving a comet, a satellite, the local nuclear power plant, and the spiritual forces native to the desert. Following this disaster, most of the humans in the area who were not killed acquired strange powers and characteristics. Many of the animals, and even some of the plants developed human intelligence and appearance, personalities, and mobility.\n\nMutant, Texas and Ida Red made their first appearance in a one-page comic in \"Oni Double Feature\" #13 in August 1999, illustrated by Barry Caldwell. Also known as \"Dini Double Feature\", this all-Dini issue also included the first appearance of Jingle Belle, whom Ida would later be closely associated with.\n\nDini and Caldwell also created a five-page story intended to provide a more thorough introduction to the setting and character, as Ida rescues a tourist from the villainous Kiyotes. This story was intended for publication in a new issue of Sarah Dyer's \"Action Girl Comics\", but the issue was never published and the story eventually debuted in the \"Mutant, Texas\" trade paperback.\n\nThe four-issue \"Mutant, Texas: Tales of Sheriff Ida Red\" miniseries was published by Oni Press in May, July, October and November 2002.

This volume also includes the one-page introductory story and the five-page short story, along with seven pages of character concept sketches with commentary by Dini, and several pin-ups.\n\nThe first full-color \"Mutant, Texas\" story, \"Kiyotes' Christmas Party,\" appeared as a backup feature in the Jingle Belle comic \"Belle's Beaus,\" published by Dark Horse Comics in December 2004 and also illustrated by J.

She was the infant daughter of a scientist and a filmmaker who came to Mutant 16 years ago to investigate the strange properties of the area and its inhabitants. Her parents were both killed by a giant mutant snake which then tried to kill Ida, but she severely injured it and drove it away by releasing a powerful blast of energy from her body. She was then retrieved by Tia Oso, the town's wise woman, and taken back to be raised as a member of the community.\n\nHer powers did not manifest again until she was 16 years old. She was able to defeat the evil snake and its minions, saving all the townspeople. In gratitude, they made her sheriff of the town.\n\nIda Red is a beautiful 16-year-old girl with flaming red hair and green eyes. She usually wears denim shorts, a western-style shirt, cowgirl boots and hat, and special gloves which help her focus her energy bolts. Her powers are:\nPaul Dini intended Ida to be \"as close as I can imagine a pure heroine to be,\" and she exhibits kindness, friendliness, loyalty and bravery at all times. Physically she was inspired by several sources, including the cowgirl pin-ups of the 1940s and 50s; western movie heroines such as Dale Evans; and the character Red from the animated cartoons of Tex Avery. Her name is taken from the old traditional fiddle tune \"Ida Red.\"\n\nIda is a good friend of Jingle Belle, the rebellious daughter of Santa Claus, and is often involved in her adventures.\n\nRollalong Diller - Ida's friend, sidekick, and later deputy. \"Rolly\" is an armadillo who maintains an ant farm (for food) outside of town.

He can shoot bolts of energy from his eyes, and he can share his power to restore Ida when she is injured or drained of her power. Unlike most of the animal characters, he cannot speak, although he is highly intelligent and can understand what is said to him.\n\nMezcal - Donna Margarita Agavita Inebriata Mezcal is an agave plant in the form of a beautiful green-skinned woman. She speaks a combination of Spanish and English. Mezcal is the owner of the local cantina, and performs there as a singer and dancer. Because of the natural alcoholic content of her body, her kisses cause the recipient to become immediately drunk, and she can use this ability to disable enemies. She has a pet agave worm named Pulque, which she walks on a leash as if it were a dog. Dini created Mezcal by sketching her on a napkin while drinking tequila in a restaurant in Mexico.\n\nThe Kiyotes - A family of \"white trash\" anthropomorphic coyotes whom Ida is constantly fighting and arresting for crimes large and small. Her main foes are the three brothers Kelso, Tiny, and Leon, who are partially patterned after the Three Stooges. They also have many nearby relatives they can call upon when needed.\n\nMayor Beaumont Juarez Lansdale - The mayor of Mutant. Once a tall man, his mutation has reduced him to very short stature. Mayor Lansdale raises one-eyed mutant cattle on his ranch. He has an ebullient personality, a quick temper, and a love of old cowboy songs which is not matched by his skill at singing them. He physically resembles politician Ross Perot, and is named after Dini's friend, writer Joe Lansdale.\n\nMarjeanne Lansdale - The wife of Mayor Lansdale. She may be recognized by her bouffant hairdo in the shape of a nuclear mushroom cloud. She has the power of teleportation.\n\nSheriff Wade Brunt - The sheriff of Mutant as the story begins. His father had been the previous sheriff, but was killed in the disaster that created the mutations.

The company owned numerous brands, particularly for flour, where its core business started, and for consumer food products. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but was acquired by Premier Foods in March 2007. \n\nThe Company was founded by Joseph Rank in 1875 as flour milling business when he rented a small windmill. He initially lost money and therefore took a co-tenancy at West's Holderness Corn Mill. In 1885 he built a mechanically-driven flour mill in Hull in order to beat competition from abroad. He used steel rollers instead of mill stones thereby producing six sacks of flour an hour instead of one and a half. In 1888 he built another steel-roller plant in Lincolnshire, and soon after, built a more modern plant, producing 20 sacks of flour an hour.\n\nAs he strove for greater productivity he installed equipment that produced 30 sacks of flour an hour, and then 40 sacks an hour. He also set up agencies to distribute his flour in parts of England where it previously had not been sold. In May 1899 the business was incorporated as a private company under the name \"Joseph Rank Limited\".\n\nIn 1902 Joseph Rank made his first trip to the United States to understand and beat his American competitors. Soon after his trip abroad, the company built mills in London and Cardiff. In 1912, a mill in Birkenhead was built to supply the needs of Ireland and northwestern England. Rank then moved the corporate headquarters of the Company from Yorkshire to London.\n\nDuring World War II the company employed 3,000 workers, many of them women working while their husbands were away at war. In 1935 Joseph Rank was awarded the Freedom of the City of Hull, in part because of a trust fund he had set up in Hull to help \"poor persons of good character.\"\n\nDuring the 1920s, Rank expanded into Scotland and Ireland. He also formed the British Isles Transport Company Limited to facilitate transport of his products around the country. The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1933. In 1943 James Rank became Chairman following his father's death.\n\nIn 1945 James Rank, the new chairman, assisted by Cecil Loombe, who had become a director, set about rebuilding mills destroyed by bombing, which included the new Baltic Flour Mill at Gateshead, opened in 1950.\n\nIn 1952, James Rank was succeeded by his brother J. Arthur Rank as Chairman. Arthur explored ways of improving quality control in food production founding RHM Technology and its research centre at High Wycombe.\n\nIn 1962 the Company acquired the Hovis-McDougall Company, founded in 1957 after the merger of Hovis Bread Flour Company, founded in 1898, and McDougall Brothers, founded in 1864 by Alexander, Isaac, Arthur, John and James Thomas, with its famous \"Hovis\" brand of bread and became \"Ranks Hovis McDougall Limited\". In 1968 RHM went on to buy the Cerebos food group, which brought with it a number of popular food brands as well as interests in France, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and South Africa. In 1969 Arthur's nephew, Joseph Rank, took over the Chairmanship of the Company.\n\nJoseph Rank encouraged research work in crustacea farming, cereal and seed production, and wheat hybrids. He also pioneered protein production from starch. In 1984 the Company established a joint venture with ICI known as \"Marlow Foods\". It was Marlow Foods that created the meat substitute product Quorn.\n\nIn 1981 Sir Peter Reynolds took over as Chairman from Joseph Rank. The company made a number of important acquisitions during the 1980s in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Far East including the purchase in 1987 of Avana Group, which was renamed Avana Bakeries Limited.\n\nIn 1992 the Company was purchased by Tomkins plc who then sold it on to Doughty Hanson & Co in 2000. The Company remained in private equity ownership and sold a number of non-core business, including bakery retail chain Three Cooks. In July 2005 it was relisted on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nIn March 2007, RHM was acquired by Premier Foods for £1.2bn. Premier made a loss in 2012 and cut production.\n\nPrior to takeover, the group was grouped into three divisions; Bread Bakeries, Culinary Brands and Cakes & Customer Partnerships. Premier Foods is in the process of integrating Culinary Brands, Cakes and Customer Partnerships into its core business unit, although Bread Bakeries (including Rank Hovis milling) are to remain as a stand-alone business unit for the time being, because of the different supply chain demands such as high volume and the short shelf life of bread.\n\n\nA common misconception is that the \"Rank\" in the name signifies an acquired business of the Rank Organisation. This is understandable as Rank themselves were at one point a highly diversified conglomerate, and were apt to rename acquired or joint venture business by prefixing them with the name \"Rank\", \"e.g.\" Rank Xerox. There is a link, but the \"Rank\" reference is to Joseph Rank, father of J. Arthur Rank, who merely inherited the business upon his father's death. It always remained a separately run enterprise.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2304128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304128", "title": "Lee Tung Street", "text": "Lee Tung Street\n\nLee Tung Street (), known as the Wedding Card Street (; ) by locals, was a street in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. The street was famed in Hong Kong and abroad as a centre for publishing and for the manufacturing of wedding cards and other similar items.\n\nAll interests of this street were resumed by and reverted to the Government of Hong Kong since 1 November 2005. Lee Tung Street was demolished in December 2007 as part of an Urban Renewal Authority (URA) project. The demolition was seen by many as causing irreparable harm to the cultural heritage of Hong Kong.\n\nThe site has recently been redeveloped as a luxury shopping and housing development. As with all other URA projects, no original tenants have been resettled on site.\nThe street was known for its printing industry, and Wan Chai was a longtime host of the headquarters of the \"Hong Kong Times\", \"Ta Kung Pao\" and \"Wen Wei Po\". In the 1950s, print shops began to gather in Lee Tung Street between Johnston Road and Queen's Road East. Rumours had it that the government of Hong Kong mandated this in order to easily monitor illegal publication.\n\nThe famous poet and translator Dai Wangshu also established a short-lived bookstore in Lee Tung Street in the early 1950s.\n\nIn the 1970s, the print shops also began producing wedding invitations, lai see, fai chun, and other items, for which they became famous in the 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people visited the shops there to order their wedding cards, name cards, and traditional Chinese calendars.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, the Urban Renewal Authority announced it would spend HK$3.58 billion to redevelop Lee Tung Street and McGregor Street, an area covering . According to an authority spokesman, up to the end of June 2005, more than 85 percent of the 647 affected homeowners on Lee Tung Street had agreed to accept compensation offers of HK$4,079 per square foot. The purchase of the land was expected to be completed early 2006. The street was duly demolished starting in December 2007. In its place will stand four high-rise buildings and one underground car park, and new shops fitting in with the proposed image of the street as a “Wedding City”. That means the old shops there, which were mostly small businesses and family-run, had to move elsewhere to continue operating, facing high rent and losing old customers.\n\nOn behalf of the H15 Concern Group, architect Christopher Law produced a counter-proposal known as the \"Dumbbell Proposal\" which would have preserved the signature six-storey \"tong lau\" in the middle part of the street. However, despite the proposal and strong protests by residents (including a three-day hunger strike by 60-year-old shop owner May Je) and other activists, the URA and the government went on to demolish the street as planned.\n\n\n\nSome of the active residents were very concerned about the H15 renewal scheme plan and later on H15 Concern Group was formed and May Yip to Mrs. Kam, the shop owners, are the active members in the concern group. They, people living or doing business in the affected area, very much concerned about the loss of relationships within the community that had taken years to establish. In fact, in order to tackle the dissipation of the relationship within the community, the H15 Concerns Groups proposed a Dumbbells Plan in 2005 and being rejected in 2007 by the Town Planning Board.\n\nApart from the concern pertaining to the community relationship, the economic concern is also one of the worries. One of the shop owners, Mr. Luk, due to the H15 program, moved his shop from Lee Tung Street to Wan Chai Road and faced 80% decrement in business income comparing with the days when he was running his printing business in Lee Tung Street. Mr. Luk is not the only one. In fact, former shop owner Ms. Chan, complained in 2016, after moving from Lee Tung Street to Tai Wong Street East, she faced 40% decrement in business income comparing with her income in bygone days in Lee Tung Street.\n\nThe other economical concern is about the underestimated compensation given by URA. During the reconstruction of Lee Tung Street, the compensation given by the Urban Renewal Authority to the flat owners was $4000 per square feet. However, the selling price of a flat, after the reconstruction, in Avenue Walk is $23000 per square feet in 2013. The URA was criticized for depriving the flat owners by paying an unreasonably low compensation to the flat owner in the affected area i.e. 1.8 billion in total while Urban Renewal Authority is foreseeably gaining $3.4 billion by this project.\n\nWan Chai District Council, in 2004 published her position paper Our Urban Renewal of Wan Chai emphasizing the following four principles. Firstly, renewal does not equal to reconstruction. It is ridiculous to demolish a community of vitality for the purpose of reconstruction. The New and the old can be able to exist in the same community. Secondly, people oriented with various choices is paramount. Respect mankind's diversity of needs and provide corresponding choices to the flat and shop owners but not long confined to monetary compensation. Thirdly, showing Appreciation to community and cultural identity. We should respect the individual's connection in the community and protect such relationship. Lastly, public participation. The affected people, due to the renewal programs, shall be able to participate in deciding the development direction, procedures and principles.\n\nIn fact, Wan Chai District Council commissioned the University of Hong Kong conducting a survey. That survey showed more than 70% of people living in the affected area agreed to reconstruct the Lee Tung Street. Wan Chai District Council also approved the Lee Tung Street's master layout plan as well as the plans of solving the concerning traffic problems in the affected area. The Wan Chai District Council also urged the Urban Renewal Authority starting the reconstruction work as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to the press release of the Progress of Lee Tung Street Project announced by the then chairman of Urban Renewal Authority Cheung Chun Yuen, the new project would take the wedding industry as the main theme of the project since the original Lee Tung Street was famous for traditional wedding industry. After redevelopment, H15 Concern Groups challenged the promise that making wedding as renewal theme as chain stores and famous brand dominated the new street. Due to the expensive rent, original shop owners can hardly move back. Also, tenants have to fulfill the term that building ‘First Class Shopping Premises’ which designed by URA and land developer. Nothing about the wedding theme has been mentioned in the lease.\n\nURA replied that three pre-war tenement houses in the renewal project are kept for the wedding industry with Eighty-nine square meters reserved as ‘Chinese and western wedding traditions museum’. However, Peter Lee Siu-man from Conservancy Association criticized that no social enterprises and original shop owners should afford the monthly rent of three rebuilt tenement houses.\n\nIn June 2013, the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) began accepting applications for new commercial tenants on the street, and formally announced the new name \"Avenue Walk\" (囍歡里). The Chinese name was a pun on the phrase \"I Like You\". This pun resulted in widespread derision. Finally, Sino Land, Hopewell Holdings and URA announced the name changed to \"Lee Tung Avenue\" (利東街) in October 2015, using the street's old Chinese name.\n\nOn 28 November 2015, the place was reopened as an outdoor shopping boulevard with one storey of basement mall. And the MTR Wanchai station exit D was opened in December 2017.\n\nThe extent to which the H15 project meets the 12 objectives spelled out in URS is set out in the table below (prescribed in the Study Report: The Achievements and Challenges of Urban Renewal in Hong Kong):\n\nIf the redevelopment turned out to be as planned in 2010, we could safely conclude the H15 project met most of the objectives spelt out in the URS, the remaining controversial part was related to the social aspects. In terms of preservation of social network, while URA has made provisions to enhance such efforts, given the fact that all the residents and commercial operators have left the site without any existing explicit arrangement for their return, the chance of re-establishing such social network was uncertain. By 2016, as shown above in bold, some of the intended achievement were not delivered.\n\nAfter the preservation of Lee Tung Street (together with the protest against the demolition of the Star Ferry and Queen's Pier and the recent controversy about the construction of Express Rail Link), the public are much more concerned on the preservation of local community, local characteristics, cultural assets and collective memories. The struggle made by H15 Concern Group and its supporters is now usually considered as one important landmark of the “new social movement”, which stresses on postmaterialist values like culture and heritage. The experience in Lee Tung Street also nurtured a batch of activists in the society, most remarkably Eddie Chu, and led to more sophisticated tactics in future social movements. Other issues in urban renewal, including community participatory planning, owners’ participation in redevelopment, “flat-for-flat” and “shop-for-shop” compensation are all reflected in the case of the H15 project.\n\n\n"}

The previous bridge was a truss bridge that was built in 1956 and demolished in 2012 due to structural deficiencies. The truss bridge had previously served as a replacement for the Stone Bridge, about 0.8 mi (1.3 km) to the south.\n\nIt became part of RI 24 during the 1960s after the completion of the Portsmouth and Tiverton Expressways.

They are common in electrical and electronic equipment, and cover a number of applications, such as:\n\nFilter capacitors are not the same as reservoir capacitors, the tasks the two perform are different, albeit related.\n\nMany filtering tasks have specific types of capacitor that are required or typically used for the task.\n\nElectrolytic capacitors are usually used due to high capacity at low cost and low size. Smaller non-electrolytics may be paralleled with these to compensate for electrolytics' poor performance at high frequencies.\n\nCeramic plate capacitors are usually favoured due to extremely low inductance and low cost. Where precision is needed, silver mica capacitors offer superior precision and stability. Where manual tunability is required, plastic film trimmers are sometimes used, though it has long been more popular to adjust the inductor to achieve tuning.\n\nDisc and plate ceramic capacitors are used due to particularly low inductance. Often a ceramic disc sits in a notch cut in the PCB, with the tracks soldered directly to the disc for best performance.\n\nAt microwave frequencies, the (FR-4) PCB material acts as a capacitor, and the PCB track has inherent inductance. The net result depends on the ratio of capacitance and inductance present.\n\nIncreasing PCB track width causes additional capacitance, and thus a net capacitance. Narrowing track width reduces capacitance, produces a net inductance.\n\nComputers use large numbers of filter capacitors, making size an important factor. Solid tantalum and wet tantalum capacitors offer some of the best CV (capacitance/voltage) performance in some of the most volumetrically efficient packaging available. High currents and low voltages also make low equivalent series resistance (ESR) important. Solid tantalum capacitors offer low ESR versions that can often meet ESR requirements but they are not the lowest ESR option among all capacitors. Solid tantalums have an additional issue which must be addressed during the design stage. Solid tantalum capacitors must be voltage derated in all applications. A 50% voltage derating is recommended and generally accepted as the industry standard; e.g. a 50V solid tantalum capacitor should never be exposed to an actual application voltage above 25V. Solid tantalum capacitors are very reliable components if the proper care is taken and all design guidelines are carefully followed. Unfortunately, the failure mechanism for a solid tantalum capacitor is a short which will result in a violent flaring up and smoking on a PCB capable of damaging other components in close proximity as well as completely destroying the capacitor. Fortunately, most solid tantalum capacitor failures will be immediate and very evident. Once in application solid tantalum capacitor performance will improve over time and the chances of a failure due to component mis-manufacturing decrease. Wet tantalums are a type of the electrolytic capacitor, using a tantalum pellet in an electrolytic material sealed in a hermetic package. This type of tantalum capacitor does not require the same derating that a solid tantalum does and its failure mechanism is open. A 10% to 20% voltage derating curve is recommended for wet tantalums when operating from 85C to 125C. Wet tantalums are not commonly referred to as just 'electrolytics' because usually 'electrolytic' refers to aluminium electrolytics.\n\nCeramic (for values <0.47 micro-farad-μF) and electrolytic (for 0.47 μF and up) are normally the preferred types where their performance is sufficient, since these are the lowest cost types of capacitors. Hence they are very popular in filters of many types.\n\nMains filter capacitors are usually encapsulated wound-plastic-film types, since these deliver high voltage rating at low cost, and may be made self-healing and fusible. Mains filter capacitors are often ceramic RFI/EMI suppression capacitors. The additional safety requirements for mains filtering are:\n\nA wound plastic film mains rated capacitor plus series resistor are incorporated into a single component envelope for convenience and robustness. This reduces switch arcing and RFI. The most common combination of values is 0.1 μF + 100 Ω.\n\nCeramic disc capacitors are usually used in snubber circuits for low voltage motors for their low inductance and low cost.\n\nLow ESR (equivalent series resistance) electrolytics are often required to handle the high ripple current.\n"}

His fresco paintings are notable for the use of foreshortening. He was the most important member of the Forlì painting school.\n\nMelozzo was supposedly from a wealthy family named Ambrosi from Forlì. Nothing is known about his early years. It is only a hypothesis that he was formed by the Forlivese school of art, then dominated by Ansuino da Forlì; both were influenced by Andrea Mantegna. It has been said, also without confirmation, that he became a journeyman and color-grinder to master painters. His presence was first mentioned in his birthplace in 1460 and again in 1464. Around this period, and together with Antoniazzo Romano, he painted frescoes in the Bessarione chapel in the Basilica dei Santi Apostoli in Rome. Melozzo then moved to Urbino, probably between 1465 and 1474. There he met Piero della Francesca, who profoundly influenced Melozzo's style and use of perspective. He would have also studied architecture by Bramante and the work of Flemish painters then working for duke Federico da Montefeltro. Melozzo may have worked with Justus of Ghent and Pedro Berruguete to decorate the \"studiolo\" of the city's famous Ducal Palace.\n\nAround 1472-74, Melozzo transferred to Rome, although some authorities claim his presence in Rome five or ten years earlier for work in the Basilica di San Marco. In 1477 he finished his first major work in the new seat, a fresco now transferred to canvas and placed in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, representing \"Sixtus IV Appointing Platina as Librarian of the Vatican Library\". In the same year Girolamo Riario built his palace in Rome, now known as Palazzo Altemps, with designs by Melozzo. In 1478 he was one of the original members of the Academy of St Luke, founded by Sixtus IV to unite the chief painters working in the city.\n\nIn about 1472-74, Melozzo was commissioned by Pietro Riario to paint the vault of the apse in the basilica dei Santi Apostoli in Rome, his subject being the Ascension of Christ. In this work, Christ is boldly and effectively foreshortened. This fresco was taken down in 1711. The figure of Christ is now in the Quirinal Palace; some of the other portions, which influenced Raphael, are in the sacristy of St Peter's. A hall in the Vatican Museums, with designs of angels and apostles by Melozzo, was taken from the same fresco. Another work of the Roman period is an \"Annunciation\" that can still be seen in the Pantheon.\n\nMelozzo's last work in Rome was a chapel, now destroyed, in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. After the death of Sixtus IV in 1484, Melozzo moved from Rome to Loreto. There he painted the fresco in the cupola of the sacristy of San Marco in the Basilica della Santa Casa, commissioned by cardinal Girolamo Basso della Rovere. It is one of the first examples of a cupola decorated both with architecture and figures; it greatly influenced the Camera degli Sposi by Mantegna.\n\nIn 1489 Melozzo returned to Rome. During this period he probably drew some cartoons for the mosaics of \"Jesus blessing\" in the Chapel of St Helena of the basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme.\n\nMelozzo also painted the cupola of the Capuchin church at Forlì, which was destroyed in 1651. It has been said that he executed at Urbino some of the portraits of great men (Plato, Dante, Sixtus IV, \"et al\") which are now divided between the Barberini Palace and the Campana collection in Paris. In 1493 he worked on some ceilings, now lost, of the Palazzo Comunale of Ancona. Eventually Melozzo returned to Forlì, where, together with his pupil Marco Palmezzano, he decorated the Feo Chapel in the church of San Biagio, which was destroyed during World War II. The Pinacoteca of Forlì houses a fresco by Melozzo, known as the \"Pestapepe,\" or Pepper-grinder, now much damaged. Originally painted as a grocer's sign, it is an energetic example of rather coarse realism and is Melozzo's only secular subject.\n\nMelozzo died in November 1494 in Forlì and is buried in the Church of the Santissima Trinita (Most Holy Trinity).\n\nWhile few of Melozzo's works are still preserved, critics agree that he contributed to the progress of pictorial art. Without being remarkable as a colorist, he painted with care and finish, creating fine and dignified figures. His use of perspective influenced other painters. Melozzo's works bear a certain resemblance to those of his contemporary Andrea Mantegna. Marco Palmezzano was a pupil of Melozzo. The signature \"Marcus de Melotius\" on some of Palmezzano's works, along with a general affinity of style, has led to their being ascribed to Melozzo and to the latter being incorrectly named \"Marco Melozzo\". The paintings of Melozzo strongly influenced Michelangelo, Raphael and Donato Bramante.\n\n"}

{"id": "2304224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304224", "title": "Punan Bah", "text": "Punan Bah\n\nPunan Ba or Punan is an ethnic group found in Sarawak, Malaysia and in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The Punan Bah people are distinct and unrelated to the semi-nomadic Penan people. Their name stems from two rivers along the banks of which they have been living since time immemorial. They do have other names: Mikuang Bungulan or Mikuang and Aveang Buan. But those terms are only used ritually these days.\n\nThe Punan (or Punan Ba) have never been nomadic. In the old days, they based their living on a mixed economy – Swidden agriculture with hill paddy as the main crop, supplemented by a range of tropical plants which include maniok, taro, sugar cane, tobacco, etc. Hunting, especially wild boar, fishing, and gathering of forest resources, are the other important factors in their economy.\n\nHowever, in the late 1980s, many Punan, notably the younger, more educated, gradually migrated to urban areas such as Bintulu, Sibu, Kuching and Kuala Lumpur in search of better living. However, they didn't abandon their longhouses altogether. Many would still return home, especially during major festivities such as Harvest Festival or Bungan festival as it is known among Punan.\n\nPunan is a stratified society of 'laja' (aristocrats), 'panyen' (commoners), and 'lipen' (slaves). This determines their historical traditions that have been preserved. Just like most of the history of European Middle Ages is linked to and mainly concerned the various ruling monarchs, so are the historical and mythical traditions of Punan closely connected to their rulings aristocrats.\n\nThere is this common misunderstanding that all the so-called Punan on the island of Borneo are related and referring to the same tribe. In Sarawak, for example, there is the confusion between Punan and Penan. On the other hand, throughout the island of Borneo, the term Punan often indiscriminately used referring to the then (unknown or yet to be classified) tribes as such as Punan Busang, Penihing, Sajau Hovongan, Uheng Kareho, Merah, Aput, Tubu, Bukat, Ukit, Habongkot, Penyawung as Punan. This heritage from colonial times still remain until today.\n\nAs a result, there are now more than 20 different tribes or ethnics with the name Punan that may be related or unrelated to one another in the island of Borneo. These tribes include:\n\nOfficially, as under the Sarawak Interpretation Ordinance, Punan is group under Kajang together with Sekapan, Kejaman, Lahanan and Sihan.\n\nUnofficially, they are also included in the politically coined term Orang Ulu – popularised by a political association known as Orang Ulu National Association or (OUNA). The association is a Kayan and Kenyah dominated association which they established in 1969.\n\nPunan are mostly found around Bintulu, Sarawak. Punan peoples can only be found at Pandan, Jelalong and Kakus in Bintulu Division; along the Rajang River, their longhouses dotted areas spanning from Merit District to lower Belaga town.\n\nThe Punan are believed to be one of the earliest peoples to have settled in the central part of Borneo, the Rajang River and Balui areas together with the Sekapan, Kejaman and Lahanan. However, the mass migrations of Kayans, subsequently followed by the warfaring Ibans into Rejang and Balui areas approximately some 200 years ago, forced the Punan communities living in these areas retreating to Kakus and subsequently to Kemena basin.\n\nAs of 2006, there were more than 10 Punan settlements (longhouses) found along the Rejang, Kakus, Kemena and Jelalong river. These settlements (longhouses) are:\n\nThe total Punan population is estimated to be around 3000–5000 people.\n\nPunan speak the Bah-Biau Punan language, one of the Punan languages. Although often confused with Penan, Punan is closer to the language spoken by the Sekapans and Kejamans.\n\nHere some word spoken in Punan:\n\n1. Nu denge? - How are you?\n2. Nu ngaro no? - What is your name?\n3. Piro umun no? - How old are you?\n4. Tupu koman si - Do you have your lunch/diner/breakfast?\nPunan traditional religion was a form of animist known as \"Besavik\". The Brooke era saw the arrival of Christian missionaries, bringing education and modern medicine into Sarawak. But the Punan communities remain with their traditional religion of Besavik and subsequently adopting a cult religion - Bungan brought by Jok Apui, a Kenyah from Kalimantan.\n\nHowever, the late 1990s showed an increase in the number of Punan converting to Christianity. This is partly due to more and more Punan becoming educated and modernised. As of 2006, almost half of Punan are now Christian, leaving only the elderly, less educated still remain observing \"Bungan\" religion.\n\nThe Punan have a unique burial custom. In the early days they did not bury their aristocrats or \"lajar\". Instead they built a pole known as \"kelirieng\" of 50-meter height to lay down their beloved leaders. In Sarawak it is estimated that there are fewer than 30 \"kelirieng\" left standing. The Punan still practise a secondary burial ceremony, whereby the dead body is kept at their longhouses for at least 3–7 days. This is partly to give more time for far-away relatives to pay their last respects to the deceased.\n\nThere are two Punan association that are in existence today:-\n\nNote: There is still lack of literatures on Punan peoples. Available information about these peoples were often sourced from either passing notes written by Brooke and Colonial administrators not in-depth scholarly research. The earliest? literature on Punan is probably one written by Eduardo Beccari, an Italian botanist and traveller in 1876?. In the late 1950s, Rodney Needham, Tom Harrisson, de Martinoir wrote a brief notes on Punan people they either personally met or heard from their guides along the Rajang river. Because of the lack of information many have confused them for Penan and also the Punan of Kalimantan. In Sarawak for example the Punan was wrongly classified as Penan by the National Registration Department in the late 1990. They are also often confused for a politically coined term such as \"Kajang\" and \"Orang Ulu\". As such the Punan through their association Punan National Association is willing to collaborate with both foreign and local scholars who interested in doing social, economic research among the communities.\n\n"}

From 1994 to 1997, he served as a studio co-host for the early round coverage of the NCAA Tournament. In 1997, Kellogg joined CBS Sports full-time as a studio/game analyst for college basketball coverage and was one of three in-studio hosts for \"March Madness\" along with Greg Gumbel and Sports Illustrated's Seth Davis. He would typically work as the #2 game analyst until around Championship Week when he would move into the studio for the remainder of the season. He is known for using the phrase \"spurtability\" as a reference to a team's ability to score points in quick succession.\n\nKellogg replaced Billy Packer as CBS' lead basketball game analyst beginning in the 2008–2009 college basketball season and called the 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship with Jim Nantz.

These include measures approved in a 1971 city-council ordinance, a 1974 voter referendum making possession of small amounts of the substance merely a civil infraction subject to a small fine, and a 2004 referendum on the use of medical marijuana. The passage of the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act in November 2018 has made recreational marijuana legal not only in Ann Arbor but throughout the entire state.\n\nThrough the 1960s and early 1970s, as Ann Arbor played host to a number of radical organizations—including formative meetings of Students for a Democratic Society, the establishment of the White Panther Party, and the local Human Rights Party—public opinion in the city moved steadily to the left on the criminalization of marijuana possession. \"The Michigan Daily\", the main student newspaper at the University of Michigan, gained national press coverage by urging the legalization of marijuana as early as 1967. However, two more specific factors pushed the city towards the eventual adoption of marijuana enforcement provisions that proved to be among the most liberal in the country.\n\nThe first factor was local reaction to the state penalties, which provided for a year's imprisonment for possession of two ounces (57 g) or less, four years' imprisonment for the sale of marijuana, and harsher penalties for repeat offenses. These penalties received national attention when poet and activist John Sinclair was sentenced to ten years in prison for possession of two joints, a sentence that sparked the landmark John Sinclair Freedom Rally at Ann Arbor's Crisler Arena in December 1971. The event brought together a who's-who of left-wing luminaries, including pop musicians John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, and Bob Seger, jazz artists Archie Shepp and Roswell Rudd, and speakers Allen Ginsberg, Rennie Davis, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale. Three days after the rally, Sinclair was released from prison after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the state's marijuana statutes were unconstitutional.\n\nThe second factor was the April 1971 election to Ann Arbor city council of two candidates from the Human Rights Party (HRP), an organization that promoted local progressive and radical causes. In September 1971, several months after they took their seats on council, the HRP's two council members spearheaded a bill that would reduce city penalties for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana to a $5 civil-infraction ticket. (The city penalty had previously been identical to the state penalty.) City police would then charge violators under the city ordinance rather than the state statute. The HRP representatives, by garnering the support of Democratic council members, quickly managed to pass the ordinance over the objections of council Republicans. In supporting the new ordinance, Democratic mayor Robert J. Harris told \"The Washington Post\", \"In this town, it was the only way to go. ... We've made a great effort to get a decent relationship between the kids and the cops. Now at least we'll get the police out of the marijuana business.\"\n\nOutside observers characterized the ordinance as the most lenient in the country. In press interviews, the city attorney described the penalty as \"sort of like a parking ticket\", explaining that violators could mail the ticket, with a guilty plea and the fine, back to city hall in order to dispose of the charge. City police and prosecutors agreed to use the $5 city ordinance, rather than the still-applicable state laws, as the tool for enforcement against violators. The city police chief, however, promised to continue to pursue large-scale drug dealers aggressively, using the harsher state laws against this class of violator.\n\nShortly after the measure's adoption, \"The New York Times\" reported: \"Under the trees on the University of Michigan campus, in the back rows of movie theaters—even, it is said, in the public gallery of the City Council chamber itself—young people are increasingly lighting up marijuana in public these days.\" However, both police and independent academic observers asserted in national media articles that the amount of marijuana smoked in the city had not increased; the locations had merely switched to include more public spaces.\n\nWithin weeks of its adoption, the new marijuana ordinance had sparked outrage in many parts of the state. The director of the Michigan State Police, for instance, immediately threatened to move his troopers into Ann Arbor in order to enforce the state codes against possession of marijuana. In the first test case, decided on September 29, 1972, a district court judge ruled the ordinance unconstitutional as an \"intrusion of Ann Arbor in the judicial functions of the State of Michigan.\" City voters responded in November by electing Perry Bullard to the Michigan House of Representatives on a platform that called for full legalization of the possession, but not sale, of marijuana by adults throughout the state.\n\nDespite the adverse court ruling, the city's marijuana ordinance remained in place until June 1973, when it was repealed by the city council. The local debate attracted attention from a number of national media outlets, including CBS and NBC television news programs and \"The New York Times\". During the council's vote to repeal, about 150 spectators packed council chambers to light up joints in protest, and one protester hurled a cherry pie at Mayor James Stephenson.\n\nOn April 2, 1974, voters in Ann Arbor overruled the council's decision by amending the city charter with the famous Section 16.2, which, in somewhat altered form, remains in effect today. The charter section reinstated the $5 civil-infraction penalty for possession, use, giving away, or selling of marijuana and prohibited city police from enforcing the more stringent state laws. The same day, the neighboring city of Ypsilanti adopted a similar measure. In adopting the charter amendment, Ann Arbor voters asserted that the provisions were necessary to ensure the \"just and equitable legal treatment of the citizens of this community, and in particular of the youth of this community present as university students or otherwise.\"\n\nPart of Section 16.2 declared that no city police officer \"shall complain of the possession, control, use, giving away, or sale of marijuana or cannabis to any other authority except the Ann Arbor city attorney; and the city attorney shall not refer any said complaint to any other authority for prosecution.\" In doing so, the provision effectively denied state courts the opportunity to declare the measure unconstitutional, as had occurred in 1972, since a test-case opportunity would thus never come before a state judge.\n\nThe perception of the city as a haven for marijuana permeated the local culture. In January 1975, the countercultural \"Ann Arbor Sun\" newspaper held a \"Win a Pound of Colombian\" giveaway contest of marijuana. Meanwhile, John Sinclair ran a local, pro-legalization radio program entitled \"Toke Time\" on Ann Arbor's WNRZ.\n\nDuring the 1980s, pressure grew from Ann Arbor Republicans to eliminate the city's lenient marijuana city-charter section. In a 1983 referendum, Ann Arbor voters rejected a proposed repeal of the section, with 61.7 percent of voters opposing the proposed tightening of marijuana codes. By the late 1980s, however, moderate GOP mayor Gerald D. Jernigan was calling the marijuana code an \"embarrassment\" to the city. In January 1990, the city council approved holding a referendum on increased penalties for possession, use, or sale of marijuana. In the resulting referendum, held in April 1990, 53 percent of voters agreed to amend Section 16.2 of the city charter with heightened penalties, raising the fine from $5 to $25 for a first offense, $50 for a second offense, and $100 or more for further offenses. The offense, however, remained a civil infraction rather than a misdemeanor or felony.\n\nIn the same election, using a tactic modeled on the city's original $5 marijuana law, voters approved a charter amendment intended to protect access to abortion in Ann Arbor if it ever became illegal in the state of Michigan. Voters mandated that, should abortion ever become illegal, a city ordinance would come into force under which abortion would be punishable in Ann Arbor solely by a $5 fine. Local judges would thus have the ability to assess the $5 fine rather than any more punitive state penalties. Crafted as the state legislature debated increased restrictions on abortion in Michigan, including the adoption of a parental-consent bill, the measure declared the city a \"zone of reproductive freedom.\" The legality of the charter amendment remains unclear, since it has never been tested.\n\nOne local activist expressed disappointment with the voters' marijuana decision, telling \"USA Today\": \"The people were clearly pro-choice on abortion, and I expected them to be pro-choice on marijuana as well.\" However, even with the new fine, possession of small amounts of the substance remained largely decriminalized in Ann Arbor, since the penalty continued to consist only of a civil-infraction ticket similar to a traffic fine. Indeed, the \"Ann Arbor Observer\" reported in 2012 that assistant city attorney Bob West could remember \"only two times in the last five years that possession of non-medical marijuana has resulted even in a formal court hearing—and then only because the users contested tickets received under the city’s lenient marijuana law.\"\n\nOn November 2, 2004, voters in Ann Arbor approved the Ann Arbor Medical Marijuana Initiative authored by city resident Rich Birkett. This ballot initiative amended Section 16.2 of the city charter to allow the growing and use of marijuana for medical purposes. The measure also capped fines for the third and subsequent offenses for non-medical uses or sale at $100. The measure passed with 74 percent approval among voters. The Ann Arbor initiative was only one of several similar measures on local and state ballots that day: Columbia, Missouri, another college town, approved a similar law on medical marijuana, as did the state of Montana, while Oregon voters rejected an initiative to loosen its existing medical-marijuana program, and Alaska voters rejected total decriminalization of marijuana possession.\n\nHowever, what had been a relatively uncontroversial measure during the election proved controversial following its passage. Shortly after its approval, the Ann Arbor city attorney Steve Postema characterized the initiative as \"unenforceable,\" citing its conflicts with federal and state law. Likewise, city police chief Dan Oates announced that his police force would disregard it and continue normal enforcement practices. Activists who had worked to put the initiative on the ballot quickly expressed their outrage. But since medical-marijuana users in Ann Arbor are very rarely prosecuted, and because the penalty for first-time possession remains a $25 civil-infraction fine, both the 2004 ballot measure itself and Oates's subsequent statements on enforcement may prove to be more symbolic than substantive.\n\nIn November 2008, Michigan voters passed the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act. The new state law supports the Ann Arbor City charter by offering protection from state law enforcement for qualifying patients and their assigned primary caregivers under the law that took effect on April 4, 2009. Under the law, a patient with a qualifying condition and a signed statement from an attending physician, can register for an identification card under the Michigan Department of Community Health managed program for legal medical marijuana use in Michigan. After registration, the patient and primary caregiver can legally be in possession of marijuana according to State law. The primary caregiver may provide assistance for using medical marijuana or even be assigned responsibility for cultivating the patient's legally protected maximum of 12 marijuana plants, for a fee.\n\nEven though the legal use of medical marijuana was allowed for in the Ann Arbor City Charter, it was still illegal in the State of Michigan, allowing for arrest by state police and other state law enforcement agencies. With this new protection under the Michigan state law, the only remaining threat to a registered patient or caregiver in Ann Arbor is from the untested nature of the new state law and the acts of the D.E.A and other federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nGraham Nash's \"Prison Song\" from his 1974 album, \"Wild Tales\", references Ann Arbor's lenient marijuana laws with the chorus:\n\"Kids in Texas smoking grass,\"\n\"Ten year sentence comes to pass\"\n\"Misdemeanor in Ann Arbor,\"\n\"Ask the judges why?\"\n\n\n"}

The company was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but became a trading name of \"Arcadia Group Brands Ltd\", part of the Arcadia Group. Sir Philip Green acquired the Arcadia Group in 2002, and is now the sole owner of Burton. \n\nThere are over 400 stores in the UK. It has also expanded to branches at out of town sites since the 1980s, such as at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands, where it has had a store since November 1989.\n\nThe company was founded by Sir Montague Maurice Burton in Chesterfield in 1903 under the name of The Cross-Tailoring Company. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1929 by which time it had 400 stores, factories and mills.\n\nAfter World War II, Montague Burton was one of the suppliers of demob suits to the British government for demobilising servicemen, comprising jacket, trousers, waistcoat, shirt and underwear. It has been speculated that this is the origin of the phrase \"the full monty\". In 1946, the company acquired the Peter Robinson department store chain. Montague Burton died in 1952. By this time, the company was the largest multiple tailor in the world.\n\nThe company expanded by purchasing various other brands, including competitors until was split from Debenhams in 1998. At this time Burtons became a brand name, and the Arcadia Group name took over as the group name.\n\nThe companies purchased or merged with were:\n\n\nBurton was the official clothing supplier to the England national football team for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1996 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup championships. In 1998 the company changed its name to Arcadia Group.\n\nPhilip Green purchased the company in 2002.\n\nThe Burton company archives are held at the West Yorkshire Archive Service in Leeds.\n\nBeginning in 1923, Burton began to acquire freehold sites in order to build its own custom designed stores. Prominent town centre corner sites were preferred and the shops often moved a few doors along the same street in order to acquire the corner site. Leeds-based architect Harry Wilson was hired at this time and developed the Burton \"house style\" building design. In 1931 Burton took over Wilson's practice to make it the in-house architecture department. Wilson was replaced as chief architect by Nathaniel Martin in 1937.\n\nThis Burton in-house architecture was Art Deco in style. Individual stores vary from the more restrained red-brick with neoclassical scroll headed columns to fully fledged Art Deco with glazed white faience tile, geometric patterns and stylised elephant heads. However, there are also many standard elements such as a wide polished black granite band above the shop windows for signage, metal vent grates bearing the company logo, billiard halls on the upper levels, window lights showing the locations of other Burton stores, and mosaic titles – sometimes including the company logo – in the doorways.\n\nAt ground level, foundation stones were often placed by Montague Burton's four children, Barbara, Stanley, Arnold and Raymond. Each store might have one or several foundation stones, each bearing one name and the year. For example: \"THIS STONE LAID BY RAYMOND MONTAGUE BURTON 1937\". The children were quite young when these stones were laid. Stanley Howard was born in 1914 and laid a stone for the Nottingham Beastmarket Hill store in 1924. At least six stores bear stones laid by Montague's wife \"Lady Burton\", and a number in the mid to late 1930s were laid by Austin Stephen Burton who may have been a grandchild.\n\nWhilst some of these Burton buildings have been destroyed over the years, many are still standing and some of them still have active snooker clubs upstairs. Some are still occupied by Burton stores (often a combined Burton and Dorothy Perkins store) but many have changed use. McDonald's first three restaurants in the UK were opened in former Burton stores in 1974 and 1975 as the company was selling property at that time.\n\nMost of the Scottish stores are listed with Historic Environment Scotland, protecting them from changes. However, only six stores in England and Wales are listed buildings, leaving over 200 with no protection from future changes or demolition. Recent years have seen stores demolished in Plymouth (2004) and Neasden (2012).\n\n\n\n\n\nBurton has worked with the Bobby Moore Fund in order to publicize the issue of bowel cancer. England's World-Cup-winning football team captain Bobby Moore died of bowel cancer in 1993. The Bobby Moore Fund is an arm of Cancer Research UK.\n\nIn November 2009, Burton sought to bring back \"The Burton\", a style of moustache worn by founder Montague Burton, through their support of the Movember campaign in order to raise money for The Prostate Cancer Charity. The \"Burton\" moustache was styled upon two influential moustache types; the English and the Handlebar.\n\n"}

Best known for its lingerie, tights, and sleepwear collections, its other clothes had a hard time competing with the more trendy Lewis Separates, now owned by River Island Clothing Company Ltd, and Peter Robinson.\n\nOne newspaper advertisement for management trainees asked: 'Will curls come in? Will maxis make it?' However, the stores never really got to grips with sixties boutique culture. Author Margret Geraghty who worked there for a while in the late sixties remembers that all the sales staff had to wear nylon uniforms: 'They were cerise with a zip up the front. Forget dolly birds. They looked more like canteen assistants.' There were also blue nylon ones with zips down the back and turtle neck with bow, which were exceptionally hard to zip up, and the assistants used to have to zip each other up. The exception was the store manager, who was permitted to wear her own clothes.\n\nThe Arcadia Group, then doing business as the Burton Group, purchased Dorothy Perkins in 1979.\nThe Arcadia Group has a training programme, which offers financial incentives to employees to expand their responsibilities and knowledge of company and business affairs.\n\n"}

It is a historic gateway leading into the Old Town of Kraków, Poland. The barbican is one of the few remaining relics of the complex network of fortifications and defensive barriers that once encircled the royal city of Kraków in the south of Poland. It currently serves as a tourist attraction and venue for a variety of exhibitions.\n\nToday the Barbican is under the jurisdiction of The Historical Museum of the City of Kraków. Tourists may tour its interior with its displays outlining the historical development of fortifications in Kraków.\n\nThe Gothic-style barbican, built around 1498, is one of only three such fortified outposts still surviving in Europe, and the best preserved. It is a moated cylindrical brick structure with an inner courtyard 24.4 meters in diameter, and seven turrets. Its 3-meter-thick walls hold 130 embrasures. The barbican was originally linked to the city walls by a covered passageway that led through St. Florian's Gate and served as a checkpoint for all who entered the city.\n\nThe Poles built the barbican fearing an attack by the Ottoman Empire after the defeat of King John I Albert at the Battle of the Cosmin Forest.\n\nThe Barbican participated in the defense of Kraków in 1587 against the Siege of Kraków (1587) by Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria, in the Siege of Kraków (1655) and the Siege of Kraków (1657) , and Russian troops during the Polish–Russian War of 1792.\n\nThe building was threatened with demolition early in the 19th Century. However, in 1817 two senators of the Free City of Kraków, Feliks Radwanski and Jan Librowski, convinced the Senate to preserve the Barbican and other parts of the old fortifications.\n\nThe Barbican was originally a large, circular tower with an interior open space with a diameter of . It was built of brick and stone and stood four stories tall. It had seven watch towers. The walls were about at their base and at the top. The Barbican's exterior gate, the Kleparz Gate, was protected by a large, semi-circular moat 26 wide and deep.\n\nConsidered a masterpiece of medieval military engineering, the circular fortress of the Kraków's \"Barbakan\" was added to the city's fortifications along the coronation route in the late 15th century, based on Arabic rather than European defensive strategy. On its eastern wall, a tablet commemorates the feat of a Kraków burgher, Marcin Oracewicz, who, during the Bar Confederation, defended the town against the Russians and shot their Colonel Panin, according to a legend, using a czamara button instead of a bullet.\n\n\n\n"}

The name is a corruption of \"silly islands\", a nickname given to the road system when it was built in the 1930s.\n\nSince the 19th century there has been a large pub at the junction, named for a prominent aristocrat-soldier the Marquis of Granby. The junction acquired its name during the 1930s when the then new Kingston by-pass road rejoined the original route of the Portsmouth Road that was then the equivalent to today's A3. The present road is termed the A307 and the A309 crosses this and links via a dualled section to the A3 road and the north. A series of roundabouts were built at the busy (for the 1930s) intersection, then called \"traffic islands\". The unfamiliar nature of the double roundabout caused it to be called the \"silly islands\", which became locally accepted as its name, but this soon evolved into the \"Scilly Isles\", copying the name of the islands to the west of Cornwall. This name, although intended to be disapproving, thus became an official name, visible on all approaches to the junction and the highest definition maps.\n\nThe complexity of the junction combined with traffic greater than the planners envisaged has periodically created tension between those who wish to replace it with a more conventional layout and those who consider it to be a landmark or to reduce speeding in an ingenious way. There are relatively frequent accidents at the junction due to a small minority of users not from the area not reading the road markings or signs along its course - the northern approach is Hampton Court Way that leads to Hampton Court Palace, which adds to such users. The Esher side, being the closer town, has far more priority than the Kingston side (the small roundabout must give way to the bigger, and the latter is to the west).\n\nThe nearby Sandown Park Racecourse hosts the annual Scilly Isles Novices' Chase. Littleworth Common and Ditton Marsh to either side are almost undeveloped commons, mostly covered by trees and grass/scrub respectively.\n\nThe junction is near to the centre of the parish of Weston Green, which is divided in terms of post towns between Esher and Thames Ditton, which is a village by the River Thames north-east.\n\n"}

He took part in the second and third Anglo-Dutch wars, both of which he is, by some, credited with having started. He was made governor of the Isle of Wight, where he is buried in Yarmouth parish church. Holmes is chiefly remembered for his exploits on the cruise to Guinea (1664) for the Royal African Company, and for the so-called Holmes's Bonfire of 1666. He is regarded as an archetypal figure both of the quarrelsome restoration officer and of the coming into being of the British professional naval officer.\n\nBorn in or about 1622 the son of Henry Holmes, esq. of Mallow, County Cork, Ireland, nothing is known of Holmes' early life, although his flawless command of written language and his elegant handwriting suggest a good education. He is in all probability the grandchild of the Robert Holmes named provost of Mallow in 1612. He first appears in 1643 on the Cavalier side of the Civil War, in Prince Maurice's regiment of horse as a cornet in the troop of Captain Richard Atkyns. From this time stems a lifelong friendship with Maurice's brother, Prince Rupert, whom he accompanied onto the battlefields of the continent once the Royalists had been defeated.\n\nWhen in 1648 a part of the fleet went over to the exiled king, Holmes (now an army captain), following Maurice and Rupert, came into his first contact with the navy. He participated in the epic cruise of the Royalist fleet of 1649 – 1652 to Kinsale, the Mediterranean, West Africa (where, between the Gambia and Cape Verde, he was temporarily captured by the natives), and the West Indies. The drain of manpower, through storm, action, and mutiny, was so large that at the end of the cruise, Holmes had advanced to commanding the four prizes the force brought back to France. With Rupert returning to the exiled court, it fell to Holmes to see the fleet paid off. Subsequently, Cromwell's intelligence service reports Holmes having obtained a privateer commission from the King of Spain (\"Thurloe State Papers\" VII, p. 248, 18 July 1658. N.S.), although the total absence of other evidence makes his actually setting out as a privateer improbable. He may, like other Royalist, and notably Irish, officers, have taken up service with the Imperial army. His epitaph in Yarmouth gives France, Flanders and Germany as scenes of military exploits. Immediately before the Restoration, Holmes acted as a courier between Charles II and Edward Montagu, by whose commission he obtained his first command in the navy, the Medway guardship \"Bramble\".\n\nUpon Charles II's return to England, Holmes was rewarded for his services with the captaincy of Sandown Castle, Isle of Wight together with a new commission (for another guardship), this time from the Duke of York himself, who had assumed the position of Lord High Admiral. But more was in store for him.\n\nThe reports Rupert had brought back from the Gambia of a \"Mountain of Gold\" just waiting there to be carried off to England, prompted the Royal African Company, whose director was the Duke of York (and whose paperwork was carried out by William Coventry) to launch an expedition to the Guinea Coast, then mostly in Dutch hands. Holmes, acquainted with this coast, was the man for this venture, and was appointed captain of the flagship, \"Henrietta\" and a squadron of four other of the King's ships: \"Sophia\", \"Amity\", \"Griffin\", and \"Kinsale\". His orders (drafted by Coventry) were to assist the company's factors in every way conceivable and to construct a fort. Privately, he was instructed to gather intelligence as to the expected \"Mountain of Gold\". The results of the expedition were ambiguous. Touching at Gorée, Holmes bluntly informed the Dutch governor that the King of England claimed the exclusive right of trade and navigation between Cape Verde and the Cape of Good Hope (which the King and Sir George Downing disavowed after protests from the States General and retaliatory action against English shipping). In addition to reconnoitring the coast and the mouth of the Gambia, Holmes constructed a fort there (on Dog Island in the mouth of the river, renamed Charles Island). Up-river, on St. Andreas Island near Jillifri, he then captured a fort which was nominally the Duke of Courland's, but obviously in Dutch hands, and renamed the spit of land James Island. Although the mission did not pay for the company, Holmes seems to have made a profit from it, since subsequently Samuel Pepys, of all people, complained about Holmes's magnificent lifestyle (\"Diary\", 22 December 1661), and wondered whether the large ape Holmes had brought back might be the offspring of a man and a she-baboon and susceptible to instruction (\"Diary\", 24 August 1661).\n\nThe expedition was the turning point in Holmes's career. He had shown himself equal to dealing with Africans, company factors, the Dutch and his own men and officers alike, recommending himself as a prudent leader. He consequently was appointed captain of the flagship, \"Royal Charles\", which he lost quickly after having failed to force the Swedish ambassador to salute the flag. But this was only a temporary setback, and he swiftly was granted £ 800 from the Crown and the command of the newly launched \"Reserve\". The appointment of an inept master led to a quarrel with Pepys, which subsided after a while, but the antagonism between the administrator and the aggressive fighter was never resolved. Aboard \"Reserve\", Holmes tested a pair of pendulum watches conceived by Christiaan Huygens.\n\nThe objectives of the famous 1664 Guinea expedition are unclear. Although Holmes was charged with exceeding his orders by capturing Dutch forts and ships there, Coventry talks of a \"game\" that was to be started there, which can only mean an Anglo-Dutch war (Bath MSS. CII, ff. 3-13). Holmes's orders, again drafted by Coventry and signed by James, were to 'promote the Interests of the Royall Company' in HMS \"Jersey\" and to 'kill, take, sink or destroy such as shall oppose you' (Bath MSS. XCV, ff.3-5) - especially the \"Goulden Lyon\" of Flushing, a Dutch West India Company ship that had given the English a lot of trouble.\n\nThe reason for the charges against Holmes was that his success exceeded even the most unreasonable expectations, and that he was, diplomatically, a convenient scapegoat (a fact of which he seems to have been aware). In sight of the Dutch base at Gorée he took the West Indiaman \"Brill\" on 27 December 1663. Stirring up the Portuguese, Africans, and even such Dutch merchants as had a grudge against the WIC, he sank 2 ships and captured 2 others under the guns of Gorée (22 January 1664), and the next day took possession of the fort itself. On 28 March, in a tactically cunning action, he took \"Goulden Lyon\" meanwhile named \"Walcheren\" (taken into the Royal Navy as a fourth-rate). On 10 April he captured Anta Castle on the Gold Coast and several other small strongholds and ships. But the greatest coup was the capture of the principal Dutch base in West Africa, Cape Coast Castle near El Mina, on 1 May. Contrary to the popular picture, Holmes had no hand in the capture of New Amsterdam. In August, Michiel de Ruyter had clandestinely been sent to undo what Holmes had achieved. De Ruyter recaptured everything Holmes had conquered, except for Cape Coast Castle, which meant that after 1664, the English were on that coast to stay. His return to England was desultory, as he tried to make out the repercussions his actions had evoked in London. Since he commanded navy ships, everything he had taken was not automatically the company's property, but would have to be cleared by Admiralty Courts to be prizes of Holmes and his men. Since Holmes's booty in merchandise was far behind the company's (unreasonable) expectations, he was twice committed to the Tower (9 January and 14 February 1665), where he was interrogated by secretaries of state Henry Bennet and William Morrice. This situation was resolved by the Dutch declaration of 22 February that they would retaliate against British shipping, a direct consequence of the goings-on in Africa, that the British conveniently interpreted as a declaration of war.\n\nBarely a month after his release and full pardon, Holmes assumed command of , a third-rate of 58 guns, the senior captain of Rupert's white (van) squadron. When at the battle of Lowestoft (3 June 1665) the rear-admiral of the white, Robert Sansum, was killed, Holmes claimed his post (which Rupert endorsed), but James gave the flag to his own flag captain, Harman. Holmes lost his temper and resigned his commission. Even worse, Holmes's rival Sir Jeremiah Smith was promoted to flag rank. But reconciliation was, again, not far away. On 27 March 1666, the powerful new third-rate \"Defiance\" (64) was launched in the presence of Charles II, James and Rupert, Holmes having been appointed captain and being knighted on the occasion. Part of the red squadron, Holmes was finally given acting flag-rank when the fleet was divided to shadow the Dutch and simultaneously intercept the French (which put him, satisfyingly, one step above Harman, rear-admiral of the white - a slighting of the principle of seniority which would have been unthinkable at the end of the century). During the murderous Four Days Battle, Holmes was reported to have \"done wonders\" (\"CSP Dom.\", 7 June 1666), and was confirmed as rear-admiral of the red, his ship having received such a battering that he transferred his flag to the partially burnt and dismasted \"Henry\" (72), Harman's ship, who had been wounded. But again, his rivals Sir Jeremiah Smith (made admiral of the blue) and Sir Edward Spragge (vice-admiral of the blue) were promoted above him. These professional rivalries were a hallmark of the restoration navy, and Holmes used the conduct of the St James' Day Fight, to start a bitter quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith, whose rear squadron had been routed by Cornelis Tromp. The recriminations between the officers and their respective factions played a role in the subsequent Parliamentary investigation over embezzlement in the naval administration and the conduct of the war. On 9 August 1666, Holmes achieved his best-known feat, characteristically (and, to Pepys and Coventry, exasperatingly) using his own judgement in interpreting his orders. Holmes was to land five hundred men on the island of Vlieland and four hundred on Terschelling and loot and destroy as much as possible. Instead of this, Holmes executed a fireship attack on the mass of merchantmen lying in Vlie Road, destroying some 150 ships, and sacked the Mennonite town of West-Terschelling. This, \"Holmes's Bonfire\", was the heaviest blow the English ever dealt Dutch merchant shipping, severely endangering the Netherlands' war effort, at the cost of no more than twelve English casualties. Holmes now was in high favour. Early in 1667 he was appointed to command a squadron based in Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, a lucrative appointment that even enabled him to fit one of the squadron's prizes as a privateer.\n\nAs early as December 1666, Pepys had commented on Holmes's stubborn opposition to the laying-up of the fleet in expectation of peace. Holmes was alive to the danger of a Dutch assault - which duly came on 10 June 1667, when Michiel de Ruyter during the Raid on the Medway entered the Medway, burned a large part of the fleet in ordinary (i.e. laid up) at Chatham and hijacked \"Royal Charles\". After that year's campaign had ended, Parliament's interest in naval administration intensified, much to Pepys's and Coventry's distress. Rupert and Albemarle, like most naval officers, especially of the Cavalier and gentleman sort, had long been unhappy with the off-hand treatment they received from the administrators. These, in turn, found the officers arrogant and unruly. Now the commanders-in-chief and their clients, Sir Frescheville Holles, Holmes and others, might strike back, especially after the Medway disaster. In addition, Holmes in the winter of 1666/1667 had revived the quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith (possibly even fighting a duel with him), which was only ended when the latter took Sir William Penn's place on the Navy Board (which again Holmes had hoped would be his) in December 1668. After peace was concluded, Holmes intensified his hold in the Isle of Wight by buying the governorship from Lord Colepeper. This put him in responsibility of the defences there (Sandown, Carisbrooke and Yarmouth Castles), but also gave him access to the very lucrative vice-admiralty of the Isle of Wight, Newport and Hampshire, with two-thirds of the value of all prizes taken there due to him. In addition, in October 1669, he was elected Member of Parliament for Winchester, generally supporting the Crown in Parliament.\n\nAmong the preparations for provoking the Dutch into yet another war, was the appointment of Holmes as senior officer in Portsmouth, commanding a powerful squadron and the flagship \"St Michael\", a first-rate of 90 guns. Holmes immediately pressed for the capture of a large number of Dutch ships, using English harbours under foreign colours; but the government procrastinated until the opportunity was gone. On 23 March 1672, he finally got permission to attack the homeward-bound Dutch Smyrna convoy. For two days, the English squadron fought a veritable battle with the armed merchantmen and their escorts, suffering damage out of proportion to their gains, half a dozen prizes only one of which seems to have been one of the rich Smyrna ships. Accidentally, Sir Edward Spragge's squadron, returning from the Mediterranean, had passed the scene immediately before the engagement. For unknown reasons, Spragge did not join the attack nor was invited by Holmes to do so, which gave rise to new mutual suspicions. A few days after the fight war was declared and flags handed out. Holmes did not receive one, which may have had to do with the limited number of posts available due to the white squadron this time consisting of the French fleet. Accordingly, Holmes fought in the ensuing Battle of Solebay as a mere captain in the Duke of York's squadron. The battle, the fiercest in De Ruyter's memory, claimed the lives of Holmes's friends Holles and Sandwich, and forced the Lord High Admiral to transfer his flag twice, from \"Prince\" to Holmes's \"St Michael\" and from that to \"London\". With Sandwich dead, a new flag officer had to be appointed, but Holmes's legitimate claims were again disregarded - for the last time. After the end of the 1672 campaign, Holmes did not get another command, notwithstanding the constant intercession on his behalf of the new commander-in-chief, his stout friend Prince Rupert. Obviously, the King himself had no desire to re-employ him. Holmes's naval career had very abruptly ended.\n\nAlthough he would not let him serve in his fleet any longer, the King continued to lavish gifts upon Holmes, rents in Co. Southampton, the Isle of Wight and Wales and forfeited lands in Galway and Mayo. He possessed houses in London, Englefield Green near Windsor, Bath, and of course an establishment worthy of a governor in Yarmouth. Most of his time in \"retirement\", Holmes spent in rebuilding the Isle of Wight's castles and managing parliamentary elections to ensure the return of government candidates. He himself did not run for the Exclusion Bill Parliaments of 1679–1681, and in 1682 he incurred the severest displeasure of Charles II for presenting an address from the Duke of Monmouth. A court martial was prepared together with a warrant to transfer the governorship to the Duke of Grafton, but Holmes either managed to avert prosecution or acquitted himself, for he remained governor until his death. A stout supporter of his lifelong employers, the royal brothers, it is unclear why Holmes should have associated with Monmouth; at the centre of the question may lie the shady Irish financier Lemuel Kingdon, who sat for Newtown and Yarmouth together with Holmes's brother, John.\nOn 21 August 1687, secretary of state Sunderland signed a commission that put Holmes in command of a squadron to suppress the buccaneers of the West Indies, but it is doubtful whether he ever actually took command. Since the wound received during the clash with the Smyrna Convoy, his health was steadily deteriorating, and an expedition that sailed in September 1687 was commanded by Sir John Narborough in his stead. Holmes was now busy preparing the defence against Dutch invasion. On 4 November 1688, five sailors of the invasion fleet landed on the Isle of Wight to buy provisions, being welcomed by the population. While the English fleet lay becalmed off Beachy Head and William III landed his forces at Torbay, Holmes wrestled with his mutinous militia. While James had fled his capital on 11 December (an action Parliament took as his relinquishing the throne) and one day later, the commander-in-chief, Sir George Legge, Lord Dartmouth brought the fleet over to William, it was not before 17 December that Holmes surrendered. He continued as governor of the Isle of Wight, although he was occasionally suspected of Jacobite conspiracy. But such reservations as he had against the overthrow of James II stemmed from the loyalty of a military professional, and after his vote in parliament against the accession of William and Mary was defeated, he served them with the same determination as he had the Stuart kings. Although his health was now rapidly giving out and he had to spend more and more time of the year in Bath, the threat of French invasions in 1690 and 1692 made him hurry back to his post as swiftly as ever.\n\nHolmes died on 18 November 1692, leaving one illegitimate daughter and heiress, Mary (born 1678, mother unknown).\nAccording to some sources the mother was Grace Hooke, a niece of the famous scientist Robert Hooke.\n\nAs had been her father's wish, she married Henry Holmes, the son of his elder brother Colonel Thomas Holmes of Kilmallock, Co. Limerick. Her son Thomas, in turn, would eventually achieve the peerage for the family as Lord Holmes of Kilmallock in 1760. Holmes's younger brother, Sir John Holmes, was a naval captain of repute and competence, having for years served together with his eminent brother, and commanded the Channel Fleet (1677–1679).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2304328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304328", "title": "Opponent-process theory", "text": "Opponent-process theory\n\nOpponent-process theory is a psychological and neurological model that accounts for a wide range of behaviors, including color vision. This model was first proposed in 1878 by Ewald Hering, a German physiologist, and later expanded by Richard Solomon, a 20th-century psychologist. American psychologist Benjamin Avendano contributed to this model, by adding a two-factor model.\n\nThe opponent-process theory was first developed by Ewald Hering. He noted that there are color combinations that we never see, such as reddish-green or bluish-yellow. Opponent-process theory suggests that color perception is controlled by the activity of three opponent systems. In the theory, he postulated about three independent receptor types which all have opposing pairs: white and black, blue and yellow, and red and green.\n\nThese three pairs produce combinations of colors for us through the opponent process. Furthermore, according to this theory, for each of these three pairs, three types of chemicals in the retina occur, in which two types of chemical reactions exist. These reactions would yield one member of the pair in their building up phase, or \"anabolic process\", whereas they would yield the other member while in a destructive phase, or a \"catabolic process\".\n\nThe colors in each pair oppose each other. Red-green receptors cannot send messages about both colors at the same time. This theory also explains negative afterimages; once a stimulus of a certain color is presented, the opponent color is perceived after the stimulus is removed because the anabolic and catabolic processes are reversed. For example, red creates a positive (or excitatory) response while green creates a negative (or inhibitory) response. These responses are controlled by opponent neurons, which are neurons that have an excitatory response to some wavelengths and an inhibitory response to wavelengths in the opponent part of the spectrum.\n\nAccording to this theory, color blindness is due to the lack of a particular chemical in the eye. The positive after-image occurs after we stare at a brightly illuminated image on a regularly lighted surface and the image varies with increases and decreases in the light intensity of the background.\n\nThe veracity of this theory, however, has recently been challenged. The main evidence for this theory derived from recordings of retinal and thalamic (LGN) cells, which were excited by one color and suppressed by another. Based on these oppositions, the cells were called \"Blue-yellow\", \"Green-red\" and \"black-white\" opponent cells. In a recent review of the literature, Pridmore notes that the definition of the color 'green' has been very subjective and inconsistent and that most recordings of retinal and thalamic (LGN) neurons were of Red-cyan color, and some of Green-magenta color. As these colors are complementary and not opponent, he proposed naming these neurons as complementary cells.\n\nRichard Solomon developed a motivational theory based on opponent processes. Basically he states that every process that has an affective balance, (i.e. is pleasant or unpleasant), is followed by a secondary, \"opponent process\". This opponent process sets in after the primary process is quieted. With repeated exposure, the primary process becomes weaker while the opponent process is strengthened.\n\nThe most important contribution is Solomon's findings on work motivation and addictive behavior. According to opponent-process theory, drug addiction is the result of an emotional pairing of pleasure and the emotional symptoms associated with withdrawal. At the beginning of drug or any substance use, there are high levels of pleasure and low levels of withdrawal. Over time, however, as the levels of pleasure from using the drug decrease, the levels of withdrawal symptoms increase.\n\nThe theory was supported in a study Solomon conducted along with J.D. Corbit in 1974, in which the researchers analyzed the emotions of skydivers. It was found that beginners have greater levels of fear than more experienced skydivers, but less pleasure upon landing. However, as the skydivers kept on jumping, there was an increase in pleasure and a decrease in fear. A similar experiment was done with dogs. Dogs were put into a so-called Pavlov harness and were shocked with electricity for 10 seconds. This shock was the stimulus of the experiment. In the initial stage (consisting of the first few stimuli) the dogs experienced terror and panic. Then, when they stopped the stimuli, the dogs became stealthy and cautious. The experiment continued, and after many stimuli, the dogs went from unhappy to joyful and happy after the shocks stopped altogether. In the opponent-process model, this is the result of a shift over time from fear to pleasure in the fear-pleasure emotion pair.\n\nAnother example of opponent processes is the use of nicotine. In the terms of Hedonism, one process (the initial process) is a hedonic \"reaction\" that is prompted by the use of nicotine. The user gains positive feelings through the inhalation of nicotine. This is then counteracted, or opposed, by the second, drug-opposite effect (the opponent process). The drug-opposite effect holds hedonic properties that are negative, which would be the decrease in positive feelings gained by the inhalation of nicotine. The counteraction takes place after the initial hedonic response as a means to restore homeostasis. In short, the use of nicotine jumpstarts an initial, pleasurable response. It is then counteracted by the opponent process that brings one back to their original level of homeostasis. The negative feelings begin to take hold again, which in this case would be the craving of nicotine. Repeated use of the substance will continue to strengthen the opponent process, but the feelings gained through the initial process will remain constant. This dynamic explains \"tolerance\", which is the increase in the amount of drug/substance that is needed to overcome the opponent process that is increasing in strength. This also explains withdrawal syndrome, which occurs by the negative, drug-opposite effects remaining after the initial, pleasurable process dies out.\n\nHurvich & Jameson proposed a neurological model of a general theory of neurological opponent processing in 1974. This led to Ronald C. Blue & Wanda E. Blue's general model of Correlational Holographic Opponent Processing. This model proposes that habituation is a neurological holographic wavelet interference of opponent processes that explains learning, vision, hearing, taste, balance, smell, motivation, and emotions.\n\nBeyond addictive behavior, opponent-process theory can in principle explain why processes (i.e. situations or subjective states) that are aversive and unpleasant can still be rewarding. For instance, after being exposed to a stressful situation (cold pressor test), human participants showed greater physiological signs of well-being than those in the control condition. Self-report measures and subjective ratings show that relief from physical pain can induce pleasant feelings, and a reduction of negative affect. Accordingly, opponent-process theory can also help to explain psychopathological behavior such as non-suicidal self-injury.\n\n\n\n"}

They meet up with Ellen, a grad student in computer science, who decides to try to help Dixie Mae.\n\nWhile they talk, several mysteries arise and convince them that the email may be a kind of warning about something going on at Lotsatech involving a professor named Gerry Reich, who seems to be involved in all the projects on the campus. Ellen finds another clue in the email leading the three to another building where, to their utter astonishment, a second Ellen appears. The only explanation of this is that they are being simulated by a computer. Further clues from another person in the building lead them to an underground lab where they find two researchers working on improving methods of producing and preserving Bose–Einstein condensates.\n\nWhen Dixie Mae and the Ellens reveal that they are all actually simulations, the researchers explore the email and find a clue that leads them to a 'cookie', a file that is passed from each iteration to the next with messages from the centuries of time they have been simulated over and over. They also find out that it was actually Dixie Mae herself who wrote the email in order to make it as offensive as possible to herself, allowing each iteration of the researchers to access the cookie. The story ends with a sad Dixie Mae realizing she can't do anything herself to stop the endless cycle they are all in, but through the passing of information and ideas from one iteration to the next someday they will have the ability to stop the simulations.\n\n\"The Cookie Monster\" won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Novella and the 2004 Locus Award for Best Novella, and was a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novella.\n\nIn \"the New York Times\", Dave Itzkoff described it as \"illustrat(ing) (...) the stultifying power of nostalgia\", and compared Dixie Mae to Oedipa Maas; he also noted that \"it is impossible to talk about the themes in a work of science fiction in any real way without ruining the surprise impact of its plot.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2304352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304352", "title": "Gangraena", "text": "Gangraena\n\nGangraena is a book by English puritan clergyman Thomas Edwards, published in 1646. A notorious work of \"heresiography\", i.e. the description in detail of heresy, it appeared the year after Ephraim Pagitt's \"Heresiography\". These two books attempted to catalogue the fissiparous Protestant congregations of the time, in England particularly, into recognised sects or beliefs. Pagitt worked with 40 to 50 categories, Edwards went further with around three times as many, compiling a list of the practices of the Independents and more extreme radicals:\n\n\"Gangraena\" is generally described as an alarmist work, deducing a collapse of national polity from the ramification of different religious creeds. Typically, the Baptist Hanserd Knollys was accused of being an Anabaptist. Heresy is foregrounded, and the analogy suggested that heresy is to the soul as witchcraft to the body. Edwards was an unsparing writer and \"Gangraena\" is described as \"monumentally vituperative\". The title itself refers to 2 Timothy 2:17, and \"canker\" in the King James translation.\n\nIt is not really a unified work, called a \"complex, ramshackle text\" by Nicholas Tyacke. It appeared in three volumes, with information added from correspondents, and Richard Baxter in particular was also a contributor. Scholarly opinions on it are now mixed, having in the past been somewhat dismissive of the work as paranoid and probably counter-productive in the way of providing and circulating a menu of \"heretical\" options. Some scholars now see it as made more coherent by its inferences from and to the diabolical element, and more readable casually for the audience of the times, than it has in the past been allowed credit.\n\nIt provoked over 30 pamphlet responses in the period 1646-7, mostly hostile. Among them were works by Jeremiah Burroughes, John Goodwin, John Lilburne, John Saltmarsh and William Walwyn.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2304360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304360", "title": "Chouseishin Gransazer", "text": "Chouseishin Gransazer\n\n, translated into English as \"Ultra Instint Star Gods and the GranSazers\" or \"Super Star Gods and the GranSazers\" or also known as only \"GranSazers\", is a tokusatsu superhero TV series, produced by Toho Company Ltd., and Konami. The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 4, 2003 to September 25, 2004, with a total of 51 half-hour episodes. This series is the first of Toho's \"Seishin (Star God)\" series.\n\nThe premise of this series is similar to both the \"Super Sentai\" series and the manga/anime series \"Saint Seiya\": there are 12 heroes, divided into four \"tribes\", and each tribe has a giant transforming robot.\nThe events and characters are described below, using in-universe tone.\n\nSome 400,000,000 years after an advanced human civilization was destroyed by aliens, 12 direct descendants of the civilization's warriors (called \"Sazers\") have their powers awakened and form four tribes: Flame, Wind, Earth and Water. Each Sazer is based on a Zodiac sign represented in an animal totem or spirit representation. At first, they wage war on each other, but after learning the truth of their ancestry and their reason for awakening, the Gransazer tribes unite to protect Earth from the Warp Monarch, an alliance of various alien species, from once again extinguishing all life on the planet.\n\nThe archaeologist Ichiro Horiguchi has indeed discovered a crystal tablet that revealed the existence of this ancient civilization and Gransazers. As luck would have it, his assistant Mika (Mithras) happened to be a Gransazer belonging to the Flames Tribe, and they soon met the second member of this Tribe, the impetuous Tenma (Tarious) and also the third one Ken (Lion), who was also Mika's younger brother. Together, they go in search of the other three Tribes and the corresponding Chouseishins.\n\nUnfortunately for them, a scientist named Karin Saeki has meanwhile gathered the members of the Wind Tribe and convinced them that the Flames represents a threat to the Earth. Then start a race against the clock between the two camps to gather the members of the Tribe of the Earth and locate the Chouseishins, even destroying them to prevent the other camp from seizing them.\n\nThe Earth Tribe quickly ranks side by side with the Flames, while Wind's members begin to have doubts about Karin's sincerity except for their leader, Remls, who is in love with her. And the result prove them right: Karin is actually an extraterrestrial planet Akelon sent to Earth by a mysterious sponsor to destroy the Gransazers. Her true nature revealed, Karin is transformed into a giant monster that is destroyed by Chouseishins three tribes finally reconciled.\n\nAfter Karin's defeat, the Impacters, a trio of extraterrestrial fighters uniting Logia, Lucia and Radia, are sent to Earth to destroy Leviathan, the Chouseishin of the Water Tribe, before the Gransazers find him. Unfortunately, all their attempts are turned against them. They first send an asteroid crashing on the island where it is hidden but Cloud Dragon (the ship carrying Chouseishins) destroys it and the debris free Leviathan from his hiding place. Radia then turns into a giant to destroy him but he is killed after the Water Tribe has appeared and taken control of Leviathan.\n\nFor his part, Horiguchi discovered the existence of a fifth Chouseishin, Guntras, and tried to repair the apparatus to control it with the help of Professor Masaki Wakui and his assistant Shûichi Hoshiyama. Unfortunately, once the device is repaired, it is stolen by Shuichi who was in fact Logia disguised, who uses it to take control of Guntras he intends to explode inside the sun to destroy our solar system. The Gransazers happily fail his project and the control system is destroyed, making Guntras autonomous.\n\nSubsequently, the Gransazers discover that the other Chouseishins can combine with Guntras to form a giant dragon named Daisazer. Thanks to him, they manage to triumph over Lucia turned into an uncontrollable giant, then Dailogian, a giant robot driven by Logia. Vanquished, the latter commits suicide (apparently) using a device of self-destruction.\n\nUnlike the other parts which are characterized by a main plot spanning several episodes and by one or more main opponents, the third prefers to focus on independent stories in one or two episodes using the classic formula of \"one episode = an opponent\", with the exception of episodes 33, 34, 40 and 41, in which the Gransazers are once again confronted with a living Logia and drunk with revenge.\n\nThe different episodes, however, have good suspense and carefully avoid the trap of repetitiveness. In addition, the fact that most of the episodes of this third part give the spotlight to only one Gransazer at a time makes it possible to flesh out characters that the series had difficulty to develop in the other episodes which privileged the team with the detriment of his members.\n\nThis third part also introduces a last giant robot designed by the JSDF, Yuhi, and the Gran Vehicles, individual vessels that the Gransazers fly when they do not command their Chouseishins. Unfortunately, after the rise that marked the second part, it all seems a little light.\n\nThe fourth and final part begins when an alien named Luka frees Bosquito, a particularly powerful and dangerous creature with the same powers as the Gransazers. Bosquito is finally defeated after four episodes, many civilian casualties and the sacrifice of Luka, while one of the Gransazers, Ran (Visuel), discovers a great affinity with the crystal tablet that reveals to him that the first Gransazers had been created to fight the Bosquitos who are the real ones responsible for the destruction of the ancient earth civilization, while the famous extraterrestrial fleet had actually intervened at the request of the space union Wof Manaf to help Earth fight them after they took control of Chouseishins.\n\nUnfortunately, convinced that the current earthlings are descendants of Bosquitos, Wolf Manafu decides to launch a new attack on our planet, which is an opportunity to discover that their ships have hardly changed in 400 million years. As the fleet gets closer, the Japanese army and the Gransazers are contacted by Brighton, a \"peaceful\" envoy of Wolf Manafu, who tells them that Ran is actually a Bosquito. Horrified, she is ready to let Wolf Manafu execute it, unaware that it is a trick to eliminate it because she is the only one able to use the crystal tablet to communicate with the leader of Wolf Manafu.\n\nFor the home run, writers set the bar in terms of threats, starting with Bosquito, a formidable predator whose new abilities are constantly being discovered and which will cause the death of many civilians (whereas in previous episodes the collateral victims of the battles of our heroes were generally ignored), before continuing with the threat of a fleet ready to exterminate the human race. It is also in this last part that the writers finally solve the questions asked at the beginning of the series by revealing the reasons for the battle that had opposed the Earth to Wof Manaf while going against the expectations of the viewer, since unlike To the appearance, the squadron of Wolf Manafu did not fight Earthlings but Bosquitos.\n\nDescendants of the warriors from the ancient human civilization, they later learn that the GranSazers were created to protect Earth from the Bosquito. Each GranSazer is marked by a glowing symbol, corresponding to their astrological sign, on the back of their left hand. This symbol can turn into a \"Knuckle-Riser\". By setting the Knuckle-Riser to \"Transformation Mode\", they can equip high-powered suits that transform them into GranSazers. Their transformation call is \n\nGranSazer is composed by 12 members split amongst four elements. When three members of the same element have been awakened and gathered, a Tribe is formed. When three members gather and set their Knuckle-Risers to ChouSeiShin Mode, they can summon a machine of incredible power called an . Once a Tribe's respective ChouSeiShin has been summoned, one member can set their Knuckle-Riser to \"Boarding Mode\" in order to \"Dive-In\" and board their ChouSeiShin. The one who is on their ChouSeiShin can change into a giant folding robot. The other two GranSazers would later pilot jetfighters called Gran Vehicles.\n\nEach GranSazer also has their own unique weapon, which can be summoned by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Arms Mode\". When piloting their respective ChouSeiShin, they can equip the ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer-Gear Mode\". They can also communicate with other Sazers by setting the Knuckle-Riser to \"Communication Mode\".\n\nThe GranSazers can also perform a combination attack called \"Formation Zero\". The attack involves Sazer-Tarious, Sazer-Mithras, Sazer-Lion, Sazer-Dail, Sazer-Tragos and Sazer-Pisces all performing a sandwich jump kick on the enemy.\n\nThe are the first tribe to recognize the alien threat and the second to be fully assembled. From the very beginning, they were assisted by Professor Horiguchi, who helped them realize their duty as Gransazers. The Flame Tribe armoured suits are all bird-shaped with red-based colour and they pilot the Flame-Driver Grand Vehicles. This tribe is also the one and only tribe which two of their members (Tarious and Lion) can equip Garuda with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer Gear Mode\" rather than other tribes which only their leader (Remls, Tawlon and Gorbion) can use this mode on their ChouSeiShin.\n\n is a rash postman, usually going in head first. He stumbled into being a Sazer after he was harassed by Sazer-Velsou; his temper and the powers within him made him transform. Immediately afterwards, he defeated Velsou. Often locking horns with Mika and the others, he doesn't quite like being made the leader, but he accepts the role. Tenma cares a lot about his comrades as well as about the world he lives. Despite frequently bickering with Mika, Tenma developed a serious crush on her as the show progresses.\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Tenma transforms into , the Flame warrior under the sign of Sagittarius, his armour is shaped after a falcon in red colour. Sazer Tarious is the leader of Flame Tribe and also the leader of all 12 Gransazers.\n\nSazer-Tarious' main weapon is the Falcon Bow, a bow and arrow set situated on the left wrist (in place of the Knuckle Riser).

The Wind Tribe armoured suits are all insect-shaped with purple-based colours and pilot the Wind-Driver Grand Vehicles.\n\nBack when he first met Karin, was awakened as Sazer Remls, tricked by the Akelon into fighting the Flame Tribe. Akira was the one who stood by Karin's side the longest, attacking his friends while still believing in and feeling for her.

He enjoys having his powers and playing around with them, always up for a challenge. Despite that, he enjoys teamwork and thus was soon convinced by Ryoko that the Sazers have to work as one big team.

He is also dedicated and tough. He would never give up, no matter how bad the odds are for him. In Justiriser episode 43, Naoto founded a gym where he meets Shouta, who reminds him of Tenma (Sazer-Tarious). When Shouta loses his Justi Powers, Naoto helps him regain his composure. He later sees Shouta become Riser Glen as he joins the other Justirisers and Demon Knight fighting their enemies, personally holding the Zokoals off before taking his leave.

After Gou realized that he is awakened as an Earth warrior, he immediately aligned with the Flame Tribe and fought some duels with Jin (Sazer-Dail).

The Chouseishin arrive, and Daisazer finishes the clone off.\n\nThough an agent of Warp Monarch, intended to stop Belzeus' scheme by heading to Earth to find Ran. Though thought as an enemy because of Karin's actions, Ruby reveals she's on the Gransazers' side when she saves Ran. Wounded while protecting Ran from Algol, Ruby is taken the JSDF. Once healed, she help Ran awaken as the Communicator to become the vessel of communication between Earth and the Warp Monarch high council.\n\nAfter Karin's death, the from Planet Impactor are entrusted with the mission to destroy Earth at all costs. The Impactors' culture is centered on honor and combat, using cards to switch between human form and fighting form. In the first part, Lucia and Radia were sent to use a meteor to wipe out Shinkujira Island, in order to destroy the final Chouseishin Leviathan before going after the other Chousishin. However, the meteor was hindered by Cloud Dragon and the fragments unearthed Leviathan instead. After the Water Tribe reveal themselves and awaken Levithan to kill Radia, Logia reveals himself. But after the plan with Guntras fails, the Impactors are ordered by the Warp Monarch to cease their attack on Earth.\n\n is the lead commander of the Impactors, entrusted with the mission to destroy Earth at all costs, following his kind's code of honor, and armed with the Hiro-Sniper gun. Assuming the guise of , he posed as Wakui's assistant to get the Guntroller to use Guntras in his Solar Annilation, using the giant robot's oxygen supply to make the sun go supernova and kill everyone. But Lucia was wounded in episode 21, and Logia saved her as he has feelings for her as well. However, the Guntroller has fallen into the Gransazer's hand, the mission ends an absolute failure and ordered to fall back by his superior. However, Logia summons DaiLogian to Earth and use it to destroy the Gransazers once and for all for the sake of his fallen comrades, taking out Tawlon, Remls, before going after Gorbion in a plan to upset Tarious. But the Pisces and Gans' interference saved their leader as he decides to wait for the Flame Tribe for a match between Garuda and DaiLogia before the others arrive to form DaiSazer. But when defeated by Tarius, Logia turns himself into a suicide bomber to taking the Sazer with him as they leave Earth's orbit. However, Logia drops Tenma at the last second once realizing this action would go against his pride as an Impactor. The bomb however, went off and Logia went to Hell.\n\nHowever, he survived his suicide and resurfaces upon regaining Dailogian and his Hiro-Sniper from the JDSF's Scientific Research Lab, beginning his vendetta against the Gransazers by kidnapping Ryouko and Ran and capturing Tappei, leaving them at the mercy of a time-bomb while he goes after Tarius to personally kill him. But when the plan goes array, Logia summons DaiLogian to crush Tarius as the Yuuhi arrives to hold him at bay under reinforcements arrive in the GranVehicles and drive him off. Logia later resumes his attack at the JD Weapon Institute to get Okito and Yuuhi under his control to hold Daisazer while weakened. But the plan fails and Logia goes to hell again after Dailogian is damaged by Daisazer, found by Belzeus who offers him another chance by increasing his power and reviving Logia in return for the Crystal Slab by taking Mika and Professor Horiguchi as hostages to force Tenma to hand deliver it to him alone.\n\nOnce he smashes the Crystal Slab, unaware that it's a fake, Logia fight Tenma to his heart's content until the other Gransazers arrive to free Mika as the Professor Horiguchi as they even the odds and force Logia to use DaiLogian to fight Daisazer until Belzeus is tired of Logia's arrogance, forcing him out of DaiLogian as it leaves under Belzeus control. Refusing to give up, Logia abducts Mika who tends to his wounds before he lets her go as he goes to hunt down the Belzeus-controlled DaiLogian and reclaim it as he and Tarious settle things in a one-on-one fist fight. But the fight ends in a draw as a satisfied Logia leaves, later returning to aid them in fighting Belzeus, though he still sees Tenma as an eternal rival. After that Logia realize that he was betrayed by Belzeus, he supports the rest of the Gransazers in their final battle before arresting Belzeus. At the end, and bids farewell to Tenma.\n\n, who came to earth along with Radia, is a swift and cunning fighter who assumes the form of a woman in her twenties with a red streak in her hair, wearing a green leotard and a cape. In her black-armored form, Lucia uses the V-Sword as both a boomerang and as a sword. She also loves Logia and would do anything for him. After Radia dies, Lucia swears to kill the Gransazers in spite of Logia ordering her not to act. She attacks Samura while he was tracking her, fighting Tenma and Gou. After getting scarred by Ai, Lucia attempts to get revenge on her, both Ran and Mika arrive to Ai's aid and defeat Lucia, mortally wounding her and taking her to the hospital in hopes of healing her. But as her body is beyond human medicine, Lucia would eventually die were it not for Logia saving her after she learns that he has feelings for her as well. After being healed, Lucia learns that she is no longer to continue the mission. However, going against the order, she use Accelerator to increase her power, turning into a giant version of herself in spite that that Accelerator's\nlong-term effect would make her into a mindless monster and eventually kill her. Though she over-powered the Chouseishin with her cloaking and clone abilities before enlarging herself even more, Lucia is outmatched by Daisazer with its pilots stopping it in time before it kills her. However, Lucia succumbs to the Accelerator's effect as dies, leaving behind her card for Logia to find.\n\n, who came to earth along with Lucia, is a hot-headed and fierce fighter who assumes the guise of a blond haired man in silvery attire. He has romantic feelings for Lucia, though having ill feelings towards Logia in spite of his forced-respect for him. In his silver-armored fighting form, Radia uses the enormous Mega Axe in his armor. He presented an interest in the Gransazers, deeming them too weak to stand a chance against him in one-on-one fights. But Gorbion's interference forces Radia to escape, swearing a vendetta on Gorbion since. But when Lucia is wounded, Radia decides to complete the mission on his own, fighting Gorbion and Pisces until he enlarges into a giant as Gans arrives and the gathered Water Tribe awaken Leviathan. But Radia's pride is his undoing when he refuses to retreat from the fight and is killed by Leviathan.\n\nThe underhanded are sent to destroy Earth, sending an operative and a spy to test the first Stage in their dimensional transport system, using it to bring humans where they eventually disintegrate instantly. After the Gransazers learn of this plot, the Bisilians kill their operative before retreating to begin Stage Two. Once learning the location of the Dimensional Transport Machine, the others go to fight the Bisil Soldiers while Tarius activates the machine's self-destruct. Soon after, Garuda engages the Bisilian mothership in an aerial dogfight and destroys it.\n\nA Bislian spy who assumed the guise of , a girl who died a six months ago of illness. She was said to hinder the Gransazers. From being with Ken and befriending him, Ayumi realizes that Earth shouldn't be destroyed though she is force. After Ran, Asami apologizes for deceiving him and is mortally wounded by a Bizal Soldier for betraying her race, revealing the location of the Dimensional Transport system as she thanks Ken with her dying breath, reduced to wisps of light.\n\nA Warp Monarch android created in the Omega Project, as anti-Gransazer weapon hidden within Earth after the battle eons ago in case the Gransazers resurface with a fail-safe built into him that would activate after seeing all twelve to self-destruct. Uncovered from a Croatian tomb and brought to the JSDF Weapons Institute, Omega whirled to life and when Mika touched him, having no memory of his past. He later began to explore Tokyo in search for Mika so she can help him gather data of the present-day society. By the time he meets Ran, Omega regains his memories of the past and is compelled to fight Mithras, unable to kill her. Confused, Omega decides to report to Warp Monarch, ordered to gather all the Gransazers after his AI is reprogramed without feeling and at full power. After getting the JSDF's secrets, Omega battles the Flame Tribe, Dail, Tragos, and Visuel before assuming a giant monster form to destroy Yuuhi. Mithras fights Omega in Garuda until the other Chousienshin are summon and Daisazer is formed and heavily damages Omega, restoring his AI as he apologizes to Mika and runs off as the entire Gransazer team runs to him as an act of redemption.\n\nFrom planet Garba, the are the final alien menace the Gransazers battle with.\n\n is member of the Warp Monarch council and leader of both the Garban and the Earth Invasion Force, the one who set up the war after making his fellow member believe the human race descend from the Bosquito race. In truth he wanted to take over Earth in order to gain a vital place in conquering the universe. To that end, he creates supports to his claim by having using Logia to destroy Crystal Slab to hide the truth and Luka to resurrect the last Bosquito to give Warp Monarch to attack Earth in full fury. When both failed, Belzeus decides to capture Ran and kill her before her abilities as the Communicator fully manifest, sending his Garba soldiers to exterminate both her and Ruby. Belzeus then arrives on Earth to personally kill Ran, defeating Pisces, Velsou, and Tragos. But when Ran's power as the \nCommunication are finally invoked and contacted to Warp Monarch's will, Belzeus' plans are revealed as Warp Moncarh allows the Gransazers to destroy both Cabryon and the Garban mothership. With his plans ruined, Belzeus is knocked out by Logia as he takes the Garban to be brought before the Warp Monarch council to face judgement.\n\nA Garban Emissary sent to Earth during a 3 day ceasefire, fakes sympathy for Earth's safety by asking the JSDF to let him investigate the Gransazers, finding Ran as Communicator and claiming her to have Bosquito DNA so that he would give them reason to let him take her, thus leaving Earth with a Communicator to contact Warp Monarch. When ordered by Belzeus to kill Ran before her power can awaken, Brighton summons Algol to carry out the task. But when Algol fails, Brighton reveals his true colors as Troius sneak attacks the city. Later, while the others destroy Algol, Tarious goes after Brighton as the Garban pretends to beg for his life so he can kill Tarious with his guard down, only to be shot by Logia.\n\nServing under Brighton, , is sent to kill Ran, though Ruby stops him when he overpowers Tarius and the Earth Tribe. After Brighton brings Ran to Algol, Tenma saves Ran as he battles Agol. When Ran finds Agol to have him kill her when Ruby interferes again as Tarious and Lion arrive to save the two. Algol later attacks the JSDF as the Gransazers arrive and kill him.\n\nSent by Belzeus to exterminate Ruby before she could awaken Ran's power, attacks the JSDF before being hindered in his mission by Dail, who manages to defeat before injuring Velsou. But Tarious arrives to hold him off with aid from Gorbion and Relms as Mithras takes Ryouko and Ruby away. However, Logia turns the tables as he and Tarius double-team Gorgion and the Impactor about to kill him when Tarious' intervened, allowing Gorgion to escape. He is given one last chance to redeem himself by using Cabryon as a distraction to keep the Gransazers off his back while he kills Ruby without interference. After finding Ruby, Gorgion is halted by the Flame Tribe. But after an attempt to use Mithras as a shield, activates the bomb on his person to complete his mission.\n\nThe foot soldiers of the Warp Monarch, the spawned from special devices often carried by its high-ranking members. They are often used to hassle the protagonists, or other duties such as supervise prisoners.\n\n\nThe is an alien construct that absorbs any lifeform in its grasp, for nourishment, into order to reproduce asexually, and able to assimilate the energy of its clone spawn when they die. It is feared across the universe, as Warp Monarch couldn't control the Bosqutio when it came to Earth, resulting in the birth of the Gransazers to counter it and the War that destroyed ancient human civilization along with the propaganda set up to link the Bosquito to Earth's people. Though nearly wiped out, the Bosquito was sealed away, within the Kabuto Mountain, until Luka revived it on Belzeus' order, with no idea who she was reviving, until it was too late. Being able to use any attack used by the Gransazers, the Bosquito overpowers the Flame Tribe and later attacks a village, feeding on the people there, before using the TV to find ideal locations to feed on next. After evading the Wind Tribe, the Bosquito reproduces a child before fighting the Gransazers and is killed by them. The surviving child began to feed when Makoto and Jin arrive and were attacked as Tauron arrives to support them before the Bosquito multiplies itself as the Flame Tribe arrive to counter the second Bosquito until Yuuhi blasts it. Absorbing its clone, the Bosquito takes the controls for Yuuhi and uses it against the Gransazers, stealing Garuda when the Flame Tribe summons it. Levithan and Gunceasar are summoned to weaken Garuda so eject the Bosquito, who starts to absorb the floral life energy to regain its strength and create two clones of itself. After the others destroy the clones, the orbs they left behind are reabsorbed into the original Bosquito as it evolves into a giant monster. After Tarius uses one of Lion's Crescents to take the ruby on its chest, the source of its power, the Bosquito is destroyed by DaiSazer.\n\nHowever, as revealed in the Seishin crossover (\"Chousei Kantai Sazer-X: The Movie\"), another Bosquito existed within the monster Bulgario, released when the monster was destroyed at sea, absorbing the JustiPower in Sazer Island, so it can duplicate itself and can disguise themselves as impostor Justirisers. They are all destroyed by Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X but quickly absorbed into the phantom ship so that it would form into Mammoth-Bosquito dragon. The Mammoth-Bosquito is destroyed by Great-Lio (piloted by Lio-Sazer) using the final move, Howling Crush, which the power of Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X combined into the finishing attack to destroy the monster.\n\n\"The ChouSeiShin\" \"(Ultra Star Gods\" or \"Super Star Gods)\" are the most powerful weapons of the ancient Earth Civilization. They remained dormant on Earth until the GranSazers were awakened, and reactivated the long-lost relics.\n\nEach Tribe possesses one of the four ChouSeiShin, which can be summoned by setting all of their Knuckle-Risers to \"ChouSeiShin Mode\". One member of the Tribe can then \"Dive In\" and board the machine by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Boarding Mode\". Furthermore, by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer Gear Mode\" the pilot can equip their ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon.\n\nEach ChouSeiShin has two modes, which can be switched between with a simple transformation. In \"Live Mode\", they resemble animals and possess incredible maneuverability. In Warrior Mode, they resemble bipedal mecha, losing most of their speed, but gaining immense attacking power.\n\n is the Flame Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the second to be awaken from its slumber in Houhou Mountain. \nIn Live Mode, Garuda is shaped after a phoenix and attacks with his guns located under its wings where its legs are, firing lasers and energy beams. Garuda can also tackle enemies after engulfing himself in flames. \nIn Warrior Mode, Garuda mostly relies on the 'Garu Claw', which are his talons on the back of his fists, for close-range combat. He performs his finishing move \"Fire Bird Slash\" with them. Garuda can also summon a sword called Burning Saber for armed melee combat. Tarious' Sazer Gear equips Garuda with a giant version of the Falcon Bow, and Lion's Sazer Gear equips Garuda with giant versions of the Double Crescents.\n\n also known as Dorcrus or Dorcrus is the Wind Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the first to be awakened from its slumber in Kabuto Mountain. \nIn Live Mode, Dorcrus is shaped after a European rhinoceros beetle and attacks with his multitude of cannons as well as with full tackles. \nIn Warrior Mode, Dorcrus uses his large array of cannons and blasters to perform various attacks. His finishing move, \"Herakles Hurricane\", fires his entire arsenal of cannons and blasters simultaneously. Remls' Sazer Gear equips Dorcrus with a giant version of the Iron Gale on his head, since Dolcruz does not have proper hands to hold objects (in theory).\n\n is the Earth Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the third to be awaken from its slumber in the Shishioh Desert. \nIn Live Mode, GunCaesar is shaped after a liger and attacks with his cannons as well as with his claws. \nIn Warrior Mode, GunCaesar uses his cannons, the Liger Riots, as hand blasters. He performs his finishing move, \"Gravity Burst\", with them. Tawlon's Sazer Gear equips GunCaesar with a giant version of the Bull Cannon.\n\n is the Water Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the last to be awaken from its slumber in Shinkujira Island when the Impactors arrive on Earth. \nIn Live Mode, Leviathan has a whale-like shape and uses his fins for ramming attacks, as well as firing his two cannons at the fins. \nIn Warrior Mode, Leviathan is armed with the Maelstrom Blades which can be used for his finishing move \"High Tide Break\". Furthermore, he is equipped with the Ocean Shield which can be used for his another move \"Mirage Shield\" which can multiply for defence purposes. Gorbion's Sazer Gear equips Leviathan with a giant version of the Blast Saw.\n\n is controlled by an advanced AI, superior to the other ChouSeiShin to have a will of his own. Initially hidden away in the Andes, referred as the \"Great Shadow\" in Peruvian legend, Guntras resurfaced when his Guntroller is repaired and Logia controls him, planning to use Guntras' oxygen fuel supply to collide with the Sun and trigger a nova strong enough to evaporate Earth, after killing the GranSazers first. Tenma eventually got the Guntroller and freed Guntras, who joined up with Cloud Dragon as an ally to the Sazers. Later Guntras is revealed to be created in order to combine the four ChouSeiShin into one giant super robot (DaiSazer). Guntras is armed with an array of deadly weapons, among them a laser battery on his chest, a cannon on his forehead and missile launchers on his body. He can fire and immediately replace his fists in his \"Twin Crusher\" attack, and his powerful feet can create devastating shockwaves in his Land Shake attack.\n\n is the assembled form of the four Tribes' ChouSeishin, along with ChouSeishin Guntras. Guntras forms the main body, head and feet; Garuda for chest, cranium, and back; Dorcrus for the legs; GunCaesar for the right arm and the shoulder cannons; and Leviathan for the left arm and the tail. Combined, DaiSazer has a very aggressive and archaic mind of its own. All four pilots have to focus in order to control DaiSazer. DaiSazer is a very deadly creature and it is armed with a deflector as well as a laser array on its chest, but DaiSazer mostly relies on brute force to deal with its opponents.\n\nIts attacks include: 'Rapid Sazer', which fires the shoulder cannons on its back; 'Blast Pressure', unleashing a blast of fire from Guncaesar's mouth on its right arm; 'God Sphere', firing energy beams from its eyes. Its finishing move is 'Hyper Burst', which unleashes the full power of Guntras and the 4 ChouSeiShin combined through the laser array on its chest.\n\n,translated into English as \"Ultra Star Beast Carrier Cloud Dragon\", is as old as the ChouSeiShin, another remnant of the ancient civilization and residing within the ozone layer of the Earth to protect it from alien invaders, implanted with a DNA of humanity\nto start back up the human race and an AI modeled after a woman from ancient civilization. She only descends from the ozone layer if the ChouSeiShin are summoned or are in need of her help for repairs. The Cloud Dragon is designed for combat support and repairs the ChouSeishin after they suffered battle damage and rendered immobile as a result, in which a sky whirlpool is created to collect the damaged ChouSeiShin and loads them onto one of the 4 storage pads (for the ChouSeiShin of each Tribe in the order of Flame(Garuda), Wind(Dorcrus), Earth(GunCaesar) and Water(Leviathan) respectively) on its body for repairs and restoration in outer space (the first such repairs is done onto the Flame ChouSeiShin Garuda by restoring its damaged left wing), upon which they can be launched straight from the colossal Dragon's storage pads once fully repaired and when the Gransazers summon them. Prior to the final battle, Cloud Dragon formally introduces herself to the GranSazers before telling them they have the answer to stop the attack on Earth. The Cloud Dragon's attack is the Galactica Prominence Cannon, a devastating blaster capable of blowing an entire asteroid into pieces. Inside cloud dragon there are Granvehicle which is one for each tribe's member. granvehicle of flame tribe is flame driver, wind tribe's vehicle is wind driver,earth tribe's is earth driver, and the water tribe's is aqua driver, which is one for each gransazer. With gransazers nuckle riser there is granvehicle mode. The sazers Who dives in they on's their granvehicle mode and says granvehicle launch and dives in. on the cloud dragon the place where these granvehicles launch is where guntrass stands in front is place where granvehicles launch which is one for everyone. Cloud Dragon's Zodiac sign is unofficial 13th sign, Ophiuchus.\n\nDailogian is Logia's personal mecha. It is a black humanoid robot patterned after a wolf and its power is almost equal to Daisazer's. Unlike his subordinates, Lucia and Radia, Logia cannot grow into a giant; instead, he summons his mecha, which is always on standby in outer space, and which Logia alone can summon. It can absorb beam attacks through its chest and redirect them back to the opponents. It first fought with Daisazer and was defeated when Daisazer ripped off its arm. The second time was when Logia and Tenma fought one on one in their respective mechas with Tenma barely securing the victory. After DaiLogian was defeated, it was taken by the Japan Self-Defense Force for study. It reactivated, then busted out of the Japan Self-Defense Force holding area, when Logia returned to Earth to seek vengeance against the Sazers. Afterwards, Logia used it as a mode of transport.\n\nThe was the result of the JSDF reverse engineering DaiLogian so they can support the Gransazers' Chouseishin. Remote controlled by a voice-command headgear, the Yuuhi is launched from an underground bunker. It can access numerous weapons, a 120-mm dual cannon as well as two arrays of six missile launchers each. Prior to the final battle, Yuuhi was broken into pieces after fighting Troius.\n\nAsahi is Yuuhi's support mecha. It vaguely resembles an M4 Sherman.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2304367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304367", "title": "Videotelephony", "text": "Videotelephony\n\nVideotelephony comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of audio-video signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real time. A videophone is a telephone with a video display, capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in real time. Videoconferencing implies the use of this technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a videoconference. Telepresence may refer either to a high-quality videotelephony system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology, which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physically manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called \"visual collaboration\" and is a type of groupware.\n\nWhile development of video conferencing started in the late 19th century, the technology only became available to the public starting in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed at \"booths\" in post offices and shown at various world expositions. It took until 1970 for AT&T to launch the first true video conferencing system, wherein anyone could subscribe to the service and have the technology in their home or office. Videotelephony also included \"image phones\" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional plain old telephone service (POTS) lines, essentially the same as slow-scan TV. The development of advanced video codecs, more powerful CPUs, and high-bandwidth Internet telecommunication services in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality low-cost colour service between users almost any place in the world where the Internet is available.\n\nAlthough not as widely used in everyday communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include sign language transmission for deaf and speech-impaired people, distance education, telemedicine, and overcoming mobility issues. It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships. News media organizations have begun to use desktop technologies like Skype to provide higher-quality audio than the cellular phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio. More popular videotelephony technologies use the Internet rather than the traditional landline phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though videotelephony software commonly runs on smartphones.\n\nThe concept of videotelephony was first conceived in the late 1870s both in the United States and in Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered. This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably electrical telegraphy, telephony, radio, and television.\n\nSimple analog videophone communication could be established as early as the invention of the television. Such an antecedent usually consisted of two closed-circuit television systems connected via coax cable or radio. An example of that was the German Reich Postzentralamt (post office) video telephone network serving Berlin and several German cities via coaxial cables between 1936 and 1940.\n\nThe development of video conferencing as a subscription service started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by John Logie Baird and AT&T's Bell Labs. This occurred in part, at least with AT&T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. Attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video, such as the first systems developed by AT&T Corporation, first researched in the 1950s, failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques. \n\nThe first manned space flights, NASA used two radio-frequency (UHF or VHF) video links, one in each direction. TV channels routinely use this type of videotelephony when reporting from distant locations. The news media were to become regular users of mobile links to satellites using specially equipped trucks, and much later via special satellite videophones in a briefcase. This technique was very expensive, though, and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine, distance education, and business meetings. \n\nDecades of research and development culminated in the 1970 commercial launch of AT&T's Picturephone service, available in select cities. However, the system was a commercial failure, chiefly due to consumer apathy, high subscription costs, and lack of network effect—with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world, users had extremely few contacts they could actually call, and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades. \nVery expensive videoconferencing systems continued to evolve throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements gave way to standards-based technologies that were available for anyone to purchase at a reasonable cost. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful video codecs combined with high-speed Internet broadband and ISDN service did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use.\n\nPractical digital videotelephony was made possible only with advances in video compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video. To achieve Video Graphics Array (VGA) quality video (480p resolution and 256 colors) with raw uncompressed video, it would require a bandwidth of over 92Mbps. The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The DCT, a form of lossy compression, was conceived in 1972 by Nasir Ahmed, who developed the algorithm with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao at the University of Texas in 1973. The DCT algorithm became the basis for the first practical video coding standard that was useful for online videoconferencing, H.261, standardised by the ITU-T in 1988, and subsequent H.26x video coding standards.\n\nIn the 1980s, digital telephony transmission networks became possible, such as with ISDN networks, assuring a minimum bit rate (usually 128 kilobits/s) for compressed video and audio transmission. During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research. The first dedicated systems started to appear as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp., which had an Initial Public Offering in November, 1984.\n\nIn 1984, Concept Communication in the United States replaced the hundred pound, US$100,000 computers necessary for teleconferencing, with a $12,000 circuit board that doubled the video frame rate from 15 to 30 frames per second, and which reduced the equipment to the size of a circuit board fitting into standard personal computers. The company also secured a patent for a codec for full-motion videoconferencing, first demonstrated at AT&T Bell Labs in 1986.\n\nVideoconferencing systems throughout the 1990s rapidly evolved from very expensive proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements to a standards-based technology readily available to the general public at a reasonable cost.\n\nFinally, in the 1990s, Internet Protocol-based videoconferencing became possible, and more efficient video compression technologies were developed, permitting desktop, or personal computer (PC)-based videoconferencing. In 1992 CU-SeeMe was developed at Cornell by Tim Dorcey et al. In 1995 the first public videoconference between North America and Africa took place, linking a technofair in San Francisco with a techno-rave and cyberdeli in Cape Town. At the 1998 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano, Japan, Seiji Ozawa conducted the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony simultaneously across five continents in near-real time.\n\nWhile videoconferencing technology was initially used primarily within internal corporate communication networks, one of the first community service usages of the technology started in 1992 through a unique partnership with PictureTel and IBM Corporations which at the time were promoting a jointly developed desktop based videoconferencing product known as the PCS/1. Over the next 15 years, Project DIANE (Diversified Information and Assistance Network) grew to utilize a variety of videoconferencing platforms to create a multi-state cooperative public service and distance education network consisting of several hundred schools, libraries, science museums, zoos and parks, and many other community oriented organizations.\n\nKyocera conducted a two-year development campaign from 1997 to 1999 that resulted in the release of the VP-210 Visual Phone, the first mobile colour videophone that also doubled as a camera phone for still photos. The camera phone was the same size as similar contemporary mobile phones, but sported a large camera lens and a 5 cm (2 inch) colour TFT display capable of displaying 65,000 colors, and was able to process two video frames per second.\n\nVideotelephony was popularized in the 2000s, via free Internet services such as Skype and iChat, web plugins supporting H.26x video standards, and on-line telecommunication programs that promoted low cost, albeit lower quality, videoconferencing to virtually every location with an Internet connection.\nWith the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet, videotelephony has become widespread through the deployment of video-enabled mobile phones such as 2010's iPhone 4, plus videoconferencing and computer webcams which utilize Internet telephony. In the upper echelons of government, business, and commerce, telepresence technology, an advanced form of videoconferencing, has helped reduce the need to travel.\n\nIn May 2005, the first high definition video conferencing systems, produced by LifeSize Communications, were displayed at the Interop trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, able to provide video at 30 frames per second with a 1280 by 720 display resolution. Polycom introduced its first high definition video conferencing system to the market in 2006. As of the 2010s, high definition resolution for videoconferencing became a popular feature, with most major suppliers in the videoconferencing market offering it.\n\nTechnological developments by videoconferencing developers in the 2010s have extended the capabilities of video conferencing systems beyond the boardroom for use with hand-held mobile devices that combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities broadcasting in real time over secure networks, independent of location. Mobile collaboration systems now allow people in previously unreachable locations, such as workers on an offshore oil rig, the ability to view and discuss issues with colleagues thousands of miles away. Traditional videoconferencing system manufacturers have begun providing mobile applications as well, such as those that allow for live and still image streaming.\n\nThe highest ever video call (other than those from aircraft and spacecraft) took place on May 19, 2013 when British adventurer Daniel Hughes used a smartphone with a BGAN satellite modem to make a videocall to the BBC from the summit of Mount Everest, at above sea level.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in the use of videoconferencing. Berstein Research found that Zoom added more subscribers during the first two months of 2020 than in the entire year 2019. GoToMeeting had a 20 percent increase in usage, according to LogMeIn.\n\nVideotelephony can be categorized by its functionality, that is to its intended purpose, and also by its method of transmissions.\n\nVideophones were the earliest form of videotelephony, dating back to initial tests in 1927 by AT&T. During the late 1930s the post offices of several European governments established public videophone services for person-to-person communications utilizing dual cable circuit telephone transmission technology. In the present day standalone videophones and UMTS video-enabled mobile phones are usually used on a person-to-person basis.\n\nVideoconferencing saw its earliest use with AT&T's Picturephone service in the early 1970s. Transmissions were analog over short distances, but converted to digital forms for longer calls, again using telephone transmission technology. Popular corporate video-conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital ISDN and IP transmission modes due to the need to convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones. These systems are often intended for use in conference mode, that is by many people in several different locations, all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location.\n\nTelepresence systems are a newer, more advanced subset of videoconferencing systems, meant to allow higher degrees of video and audio fidelity. Such high-end systems are typically deployed in corporate settings.\n\nMobile collaboration systems are another recent development, combining the use of video, audio, and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand-held electronic devices broadcasting over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time, independent of location.\n\nA more recent technology encompassing these functions is TV cams. TV cams enable people to make video \"phone\" calls using video calling services, like Skype on their TV, without using a PC connection. TV cams are specially designed video cameras that feed images in real time to another TV camera or other compatible computing devices like smartphones, tablets and computers.\n\n\"Webcams\" are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing.\n\nEach of the systems has its own advantages and disadvantages, including video quality, capital cost, degrees of sophistication, transmission capacity requirements, and cost of use.\n\nFrom the least to the most expensive systems:\n\nComputer security experts have shown that poorly configured or inadequately supervised videoconferencing system can permit an easy \"virtual\" entry by computer hackers and criminals into company premises and corporate boardrooms, via their own videoconferencing systems.\n\nFor over a century, futurists have envisioned a future where telephone conversations will take place as actual face-to-face encounters with video as well as audio. Sometimes it is simply not possible or practical to have face-to-face meetings with two or more people. Sometimes a telephone conversation or conference call is adequate. Other times, e-mail exchanges are adequate. However, videoconferencing adds another possible alternative, and can be considered when:\n\nBill Gates said in 2001 that he used video conferencing \"three or four times a year\", because digital scheduling was difficult and \"if the overhead is super high, then you might as well just have a face-to-face meeting\". Some observers argue that three outstanding issues have prevented videoconferencing from becoming a widely adopted form of communication, despite the ubiquity of videoconferencing-capable systems.\n\n\nThese are some of the reasons many systems are often used for internal corporate use only, as they are less likely to result in lost sales. One alternative to companies lacking dedicated facilities is the rental of videoconferencing-equipped meeting rooms in cities around the world. Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting, with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed. The issue of eye-contact may be solved with advancing technology, including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place. The ubiquity of smartphones, tablet computers, and computers with built-in audio and webcams in developed countries obviates the need to buy expensive hardware.\n\nThe core technology used in a videotelephony system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled packets, which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind (usually ISDN or IP).\n\nThe other components required for a videoconferencing system include:\n\nThere are basically two kinds of videoconferencing and videophone systems:\n\n\nVideoconferencing systems use two methods to determine which video feed or feeds to display.\n\n\"Continuous Presence\" simply displays all participants at the same time, usually with the exception that the viewer either does not see their own feed, or sees their own feed in miniature.\n\n\"Voice-Activated Switch\" selectively chooses a feed to display at each endpoint, with the goal of showing the person who is currently speaking. This is done by choosing the feed (other than the viewer) which has the loudest audio input (perhaps with some filtering to avoid switching for very short-lived volume spikes). Often if no remote parties are currently speaking, the feed with the last speaker remains on the screen.\n\nAcoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is a processing algorithm that uses the knowledge of audio output to monitor audio input and filter from it noises that echo back after some time delay. If unattended, these echoes can be re-amplified several times, leading to problems including:\n\nEcho cancellation is a processor-intensive task that usually works over a narrow range of sound delays.\n\nVideophones have historically employed a variety of transmission and reception bandwidths, which can be understood as data transmission speeds. The lower the transmission/reception bandwidth, the lower the data transfer rate, resulting in a progressively limited and poorer image quality (i.e. lower resolution and/or frame rate). Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related, but are also subject to other factors such as data compression techniques. Some early videophones employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting poor video quality.\n\n\"Broadband bandwidth\" is often called \"\"high-speed\"\", because it usually has a high rate of data transmission. In general, any connection of 256 kbit/s (0.256 Mbit/s) or greater is more concisely considered broadband Internet. The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendation I.113 has defined broadband as a transmission capacity at 1.5 to 2Mbit/s. The Federal Communications Commission (United States) definition of broadband is 25 Mbit/s.\n\nCurrently, adequate video for some purposes becomes possible at data rates lower than the ITU-T broadband definition, with rates of 768 kbit/s and 384 kbit/s used for some video conferencing applications, and rates as low as 100 kbit/s used for videophones using H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression protocols. The newer MPEG-4 video and audio compression format can deliver high-quality video at 2Mbit/s, which is at the low end of cable modem and ADSL broadband performance.\n\nThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has three umbrellas of standards for videoconferencing:\n\nThe Unified Communications Interoperability Forum (UCIF), a non-profit alliance between communications vendors, launched in May 2010. The organization's vision is to maximize the interoperability of UC based on existing standards. Founding members of UCIF include HP, Microsoft, Polycom, Logitech/LifeSize Communications, and Juniper Networks.\n\nVideoconferencing in the late 20th century was limited to the H.323 protocol (notably Cisco's SCCP implementation was an exception), but newer videophones often use SIP, which is often easier to set up in home networking environments. It is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). H.323 is still used, but more commonly for business videoconferencing, while SIP is more commonly used in personal consumer videophones. A number of call-setup methods based on instant messaging protocols such as Skype also now provide video.\n\nAnother protocol used by videophones is H.324, which mixes call setup and video compression. Videophones that work on regular phone lines typically use H.324, but the bandwidth is limited by the modem to around 33 kbit/s, limiting the video quality and frame rate. A slightly modified version of H.324 called 3G-324M defined by 3GPP is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls, typically for use only in UMTS networks.\n\nThere is also H.320 standard, which specified technical requirements for narrow-band visual telephone systems and terminal equipment, typically for videoconferencing and videophone services. It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth ISDN digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines. Modern products based on H.320 standard usually support also H.323 standard.\n\nThe IAX2 protocol also supports videophone calls natively, using the protocol's own capabilities to transport alternate media streams. A few hobbyists obtained the Nortel 1535 Color SIP Videophone cheaply in 2010 as surplus after Nortel's bankruptcy and deployed the sets on the Asterisk (PBX) platform. While additional software is required to patch together multiple video feeds for conference calls or convert between dissimilar video standards, SIP calls between two identical handsets within the same PBX were relatively straightforward.\n\nThe components within a videoconferencing system can be divided up into several different layers: User Interface, Conference Control, Control or Signaling Plane, and Media Plane.\n\nVideoconferencing User Interfaces (VUI) can be either graphical or voice-responsive. Many in the industry have encountered both types of interface, and normally a graphical interface is encountered on a computer. User interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses; they can be used for scheduling, setup, and making a videocall. Through the user interface the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system.\n\nConference Control performs resource allocation, management, and routing. This layer along with the User Interface creates meetings (scheduled or unscheduled) or adds and removes participants from a conference.\n\nControl (Signaling) Plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call and/or a conference. Signals can be, but aren't limited to, H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Protocols. These signals control incoming and outgoing connections as well as session parameters.\n\nThe Media Plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming. This layer manages Real-Time Transport Protocols, User Datagram Packets (UDP) and Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP). The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec, frame rate, video size, and many others. RTCP on the other hand acts as a quality control Protocol for detecting errors during streaming.\n\nSimultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardware-based system by means of a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). This is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources (in a similar way to the audio conference call). All parties call the MCU, or the MCU can also call the parties which are going to participate, in sequence. There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. There are MCUs which are pure software, and others which are a combination of hardware and software. An MCU is characterised according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle, its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols, and features such as Continuous Presence, in which multiple parties can be seen on-screen at once. MCUs can be stand-alone hardware devices, or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units.\n\nThe MCU consists of two logical components:\n\nThe MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls. This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources.\nWhile the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations, the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint. The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference.\n\nSome systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU, stand-alone, embedded or otherwise. These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as \"decentralized multipoint\", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central \"manager\" or other bottleneck. The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don't have to be relayed through a central point. Also, users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU. This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth, because every station must transmit to every other station directly.\n\nCloud-based video conferencing can be used without the hardware generally required by other video conferencing systems, and can be designed for use by SMEs, or larger international or multinational corporations like Facebook. Cloud-based systems can handle either 2D or 3D video broadcasting. Cloud-based systems can also implement mobile calls, VOIP, and other forms of video calling. They can also come with a video recording function to archive past meetings.\n\nHigh speed Internet connectivity has become more widely available at a reasonable cost and the cost of video capture and display technology has decreased. Consequently, personal videoconferencing systems based on a webcam, personal computer system, software compression, and broadband Internet connectivity have become progressively more affordable to the general public. Also, the hardware used for this technology has continued to improve in quality, and prices have dropped dramatically. The availability of freeware (often as part of chat programs) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many.\n\nThe widest deployment of video telephony now occurs in mobile phones. Nearly all mobile phones supporting UMTS networks can work as videophones using their internal cameras, and are able to make video calls wirelessly to other UMTS users in the same country or internationally. As of the second quarter of 2007, there are over 131 million UMTS users (and hence potential videophone users), on 134 networks in 59 countries. Mobile phones can also use broadband wireless Internet, whether through the cell phone network or over a local wifi connection, along with software-based videophone apps to make calls to any video-capable Internet user, whether mobile or fixed.\n\nDeaf, hard-of-hearing, and mute individuals have a particular role in the development of affordable high-quality videotelephony as a means of communicating with each other in sign language. Unlike Video Relay Service, which is intended to support communication between a caller using sign language and another party using spoken language, videoconferencing can be used directly between two deaf signers.\n\nVideophones are increasingly used in the provision of telemedicine to the elderly, disabled, and to those in remote locations, where the ease and convenience of quickly obtaining diagnostic and consultative medical services are readily apparent. In one single instance quoted in 2006: \"A nurse-led clinic at Letham has received positive feedback on a trial of a video-link which allowed 60 pensioners to be assessed by medics without travelling to a doctor's office or medical clinic.\" A further improvement in telemedical services has been the development of new technology incorporated into special videophones to permit remote diagnostic services, such as blood sugar level, blood pressure, and vital signs monitoring. Such units are capable of relaying both regular audio-video plus medical data over either standard (POTS) telephone or newer broadband lines.\nVideotelephony has also been deployed in corporate teleconferencing, also available through the use of public access videoconferencing rooms. A higher level of videoconferencing that employs advanced telecommunication technologies and high-resolution displays is called \"telepresence\".\n\nToday the principles, if not the precise mechanisms, of a videophone are employed by many users worldwide in the form of webcam videocalls using personal computers, with inexpensive webcams, microphones, and free videocalling Web client programs. Thus an activity that was disappointing as a separate service has found a niche as a minor feature in software products intended for other purposes.\n\nAccording to Juniper Research, smartphone videophone users will reach 29 million by 2015 globally.\n\nA study conducted by Pew Research in 2010, revealed that 7% of Americans have made a mobile video call.\n\nIn the United States, videoconferencing has allowed testimony to be used for an individual who is unable or prefers not to attend the physical legal settings, or would be subjected to severe psychological stress in doing so, however there is a controversy on the use of testimony by foreign or unavailable witnesses via video transmission, regarding the violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn a military investigation in North Carolina, Afghan witnesses have testified via videoconferencing.\n\nIn Hall County, Georgia, videoconferencing systems are used for initial court appearances. The systems link jails with court rooms, reducing the expenses and security risks of transporting prisoners to the courtroom.\n\nThe U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA), which oversees the world's largest administrative judicial system under its Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR), has made extensive use of videoconferencing to conduct hearings at remote locations. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) conducted 86,320 videoconferenced hearings, a 55% increase over FY 2008. In August 2010, the SSA opened its fifth and largest videoconferencing-only National Hearing Center (NHC), in St. Louis, Missouri. This continues the SSA's effort to use video hearings as a means to clear its substantial hearing backlog. Since 2007, the SSA has also established NHCs in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Baltimore, Maryland, Falls Church, Virginia, and Chicago.\n\nVideoconferencing provides students with the opportunity to learn by participating in two-way communication forums. Furthermore, teachers and lecturers worldwide can be brought to remote or otherwise isolated educational facilities. Students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another through practices known as telecollaboration(in foreign language education) and virtual exchange, although language barriers will continue to be present. Such students are able to explore, communicate, analyze, and share information and ideas with one another. Through videoconferencing, students can visit other parts of the world to speak with their peers, as well as visit museums and other cultural and educational facilities. Such virtual field trips can provide enriched learning opportunities to students, especially those in geographically isolated locations, and to the economically disadvantaged. Small schools can use these technologies to pool resources and provide courses, such as in foreign languages, which could not otherwise be offered.\n\nA few examples of benefits that videoconferencing can provide in campus environments include:\n\nVideoconferencing is a highly useful technology for real time telemedicine and telenursing applications, such as diagnosis, consulting, transmission of medical images, etc. With videoconferencing, patients may contact nurses and physicians in emergency or routine situations; physicians and other paramedical professionals can discuss cases across large distances. Rural areas can use this technology for diagnostic purposes, thus saving lives and making more efficient use of health care money. For example, a rural medical center in Ohio used videoconferencing to successfully cut the number of transfers of sick infants to a hospital away. This had previously cost nearly $10,000 per transfer.\n\nSpecial peripherals such as microscopes fitted with digital cameras, videoendoscopes, medical ultrasound imaging devices, otoscopes, etc., can be used in conjunction with videoconferencing equipment to transmit data about a patient. Recent developments in mobile collaboration on hand-held mobile devices have also extended video-conferencing capabilities to locations previously unreachable, such as a remote community, long-term care facility, or a patient's home.\n\nVideoconferencing can enable individuals in distant locations to participate in meetings on short notice, with time and money savings. Technology such as VoIP can be used in conjunction with desktop videoconferencing to enable low-cost face-to-face business meetings without leaving the desk, especially for businesses with widespread offices. The technology is also used for telecommuting, in which employees work from home. One research report based on a sampling of 1,800 corporate employees showed that, as of June 2010, 54% of the respondents with access to video conferencing used it \"all of the time\" or \"frequently\".\n\nIntel Corporation have used videoconferencing to reduce both costs and environmental impacts of its business operations.\n\nVideoconferencing is also currently being introduced on online networking websites, in order to help businesses form profitable relationships quickly and efficiently without leaving their place of work. This has been leveraged by banks to connect busy banking professionals with customers in various locations using video banking technology.\n\nVideoconferencing on hand-held mobile devices (mobile collaboration technology) is being used in industries such as manufacturing, energy, healthcare, insurance, government, and public safety. Live, visual interaction removes traditional restrictions of distance and time, often in locations previously unreachable, such as a manufacturing plant floor thousands of miles away.\n\nIn the increasingly globalized film industry, videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production. For example, for the 2013 award-winning animated film \"Frozen\", Burbank-based Walt Disney Animation Studios hired the New York City-based husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez to write the songs, which required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months.\n\nWith the development of lower cost endpoints, cloud based infrastructure and technology trends such as WebRTC, Video Conferencing is moving from just a business-to-business offering, to a business-to-business and business-to-consumer offering.\n\nAlthough videoconferencing has frequently proven its value, research has shown that some non-managerial employees prefer not to use it due to several factors, including anxiety. Some such anxieties can be avoided if managers use the technology as part of the normal course of business. Remote workers can also adopt certain behaviors and best practices to stay connected with their co-workers and company.\n\nResearchers also find that attendees of business and medical videoconferences must work harder to interpret information delivered during a conference than they would if they attended face-to-face. They recommend that those coordinating videoconferences make adjustments to their conferencing procedures and equipment.\n\nThe concept of press videoconferencing was developed in October 2007 by the PanAfrican Press Association (APPA), a Paris France-based non-governmental organization, to allow African journalists to participate in international press conferences on developmental and good governance issues.\n\nPress videoconferencing permits international press conferences via videoconferencing over the Internet. Journalists can participate on an international press conference from any location, without leaving their offices or countries. They need only be seated by a computer connected to the Internet in order to ask their questions.\n\nIn 2004, the International Monetary Fund introduced the Online Media Briefing Center, a password-protected site available only to professional journalists. The site enables the IMF to present press briefings globally and facilitates direct questions to briefers from the press. The site has been copied by other international organizations since its inception. More than 4,000 journalists worldwide are currently registered with the IMF.\n\nOne of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT&T's videophone (trademarked as the \"Picturephone\") was introduced to the public at the 1964 New York World's Fair—two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city. Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony.\n\nThe use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient and powerful video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s.\n\nSignificant improvements in video call quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in 2003 when Sorenson Media Inc. (formerly Sorenson Vision Inc.), a video compression software coding company, developed its VP-100 model stand-alone videophone specifically for the deaf community. It was designed to output its video to the user's television in order to lower the cost of acquisition, and to offer remote control and a powerful video compression codec for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services. Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf, and from there to the greater deaf community.\n\nCoupled with similar high-quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers, the availability of high speed Internet, and sponsored video relay services authorized by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country.\n\nUsing such video equipment in the present day, the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and speech-impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using sign language. The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide \"Video Relay Services\" (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via Video Remote Interpreting (VRI). The relative low cost and widespread availability of 3G mobile phone technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways.\n\nSign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing, or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (LSF) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (LSE) to spoken Spanish, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), German Sign Language (DGS) to spoken German, and so on.\n\nMultilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as a multilingual interpreter interpreting a call from a deaf person using ASL to reserve a hotel room at a hotel in the Dominican Republic whose staff speaks Spanish only, therefore the interpreter has to utilize ASL, spoken Spanish, and spoken English to facilitate the call for the deaf person), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable mental processing efforts on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction, semantics and syntax, different from the aural version of the same principal language.\n\nWith video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.\n\nThe name \"videophone\" never became as standardized as its earlier counterpart \"telephone\", resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. Videophones are also known as \"video phones\", \"videotelephones\" (or \"video telephones\") and often by an early trademarked name \"Picturephone\", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name \"videophone\" slowly entered into general use after 1950,\nalthough \"video telephone\" likely entered the lexicon earlier after \"video\" was coined in 1935.\n\n\"Videophone calls\" (also: \"videocalls\", \"video chat\") as well as \"Skype\" and \"Skyping\" in verb form differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups. However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term \"videoconferencing\" is now frequently used instead of \"videocall\" for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a \"video link\".\n\n\"Webcams\" are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing.\n\nA \"videoconference system\" is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A \"videoconference\" (also known as a \"videoteleconference\") allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.\n\nA \"telepresence system\" is a high-end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by enterprise-level corporate offices. Telepresence conference rooms use state-of-the art room designs, video cameras, displays, sound-systems and processors, coupled with high-to-very-high capacity bandwidth transmissions.\n\nTypical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one, one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal, business, educational, deaf Video Relay Service and tele-medical, diagnostic and rehabilitative use or services. New services utilizing videocalling and videoconferencing, such as teachers and psychologists conducting online sessions, personal videocalls to inmates incarcerated in penitentiaries, and videoconferencing to resolve airline engineering issues at maintenance facilities, are being created or evolving on an ongoing basis.\n\nOther names for \"videophone\" that have been used in English are: \"Viewphone\" (the British Telecom equivalent to AT&T's Picturephone), and \"visiophone\", a common French translation that has also crept into limited English usage, as well as over twenty less common names and expressions. Latin-based translations of \"videophone\" in other languages include \"vidéophone\" (French), \"Bildtelefon\" (German), \"videotelefono\" (Italian), both \"videófono\" and \"videoteléfono\" (Spanish), both \"beeldtelefoon\" and \"videofoon\" (Dutch), and \"videofonía\" (Catalan).\n\nA \"telepresence robot\" (also telerobotics) is a robotically controlled and motorized video conferencing display to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in an office, home, school, etc. when one cannot be there in person. The robotic avatar device can move about and look around at the command of the remote person it represents.\n\nIn science fiction literature, names commonly associated with videophones include \"telephonoscope\", \"telephote\", \"viewphone\", \"vidphone\", \"vidfone\", and \"visiphone\". The first example was probably the cartoon \"Edison's Telephonoscope\" by George du Maurier in \"Punch\" 1878. In many science fiction movies and TV programs that are set in the future, videophones were used as a primary method of communication. One of the first movies where a videophone was used was Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927).\n\nOther notable examples of videophones in popular culture include an iconic scene from the 1968 film set on Space Station V. The movie was released shortly before AT&T began its efforts to commercialize its Picturephone Mod II service in several cities and depicts a videocall to Earth using an advanced AT&T videophone—which it predicts will cost $1.70 for a two-minute call in 2001 (a fraction of the company's real rates on Earth in 1968). Film director Stanley Kubrick strove for scientific accuracy, relying on interviews with scientists and engineers at Bell Labs in the United States. Dr. Larry Rabiner of Bell Labs, discussing videophone research in the documentary \"2001: The Making of a Myth\", stated that in the mid- to late-1960s videophones \"...captured the imagination of the public and... of Mr. Kubrick and the people who reported to him\". In one \"2001\" movie scene a central character, Dr. Heywood Floyd, calls home to contact his family, a social feature noted in the \"Making of a Myth\". Floyd talks with and views his daughter from a space station in orbit above the Earth, discussing what type of present he should bring home for her.\n\nA portable videophone is also featured prominently in the 2009 science fiction movie \"Moon\", where the story's protagonist, Sam Bell, also calls home as well to communicate with loved ones. Bell, the lone occupant of a mining station on the far side of the Earth's moon, finally succeeds in making his videocall after an extended work period, but becomes traumatized when viewing his daughter.\n\nOther earlier examples of videophones in popular culture included a videophone that was featured in the Warner Bros. cartoon, \"Plane Daffy\", in which the female spy Hatta Mari used a videophone to communicate with Adolf Hitler (1944), as well as a device with the same functionality has been used by the comic strip character \"Dick Tracy\", who often used his \"2-way wrist TV\" to communicate with police headquarters. (1964–1977).\n\nBy the early 2010s videotelephony and videophones had become commonplace and unremarkable in various forms of media, in part due to their real and ubiquitous presence in common electronic devices and laptop computers. Additionally, TV programming increasingly utilized videophones to interview subjects of interest and to present live coverage by news correspondents, via the Internet or by satellite links. In the mass market media, the popular U.S. TV talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey incorporated videotelephony into her TV program on a regular basis from May 21, 2009, with an initial episode called \"Where the Skype Are You?\", as part of a marketing agreement with the Internet telecommunication company Skype.\n\nAdditionally, videophones have been featured in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He then changed to study divinity. He was licensed as a preacher and became a highly effective communicator, but the impact of phrenological thinking led him to abandon the Church for education.\n\nNichol held a number of posts in education and journalism and corresponded with many leading thinkers of the times, including John Stuart Mill. He clearly made some impression in economics as James Mill and Nassau Senior nominated him as Jean-Baptiste Say's successor as professor of political economy at the Collège de France though he was at the time too ill to take the post.\n\nIn 1836 and in competition with Thomas Carlyle, Nichol was appointed Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasgow. He became an enthusiastic and effective lecturer and made a profound impression on William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin with his introduction of the \"Continental\" approach to mathematical physics of Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier. He lived at the Glasgow Observatory.\n\nNichol turned to popular lecturing and authored a number of popular and successful books about astronomy, especially championing the nebular hypothesis.

His father, Hymann Michael Jacobson, was born in Ilūkste, Latvia, in 1885. His mother, Liebe (Melamed) Jacobson, was born in Kelme, Lithuania, in 1896. Jacobson had two older brothers, Israel Joshua and Hirsh, and a younger sister, Aviva. His mother's family emigrated to South Africa in 1919, after the death of his grandfather. His grandfather, Heshel Melamed, was a rabbi, and refused to leave Lithuania after traveling to the United States and finding that many Jews were not following their religion. Jacobson later wrote in his memoir \"Heshel's Kingdom\" about his travels back to Lithuania to find out more information about his grandfather.\n\nWhen Dan was four, the family moved from Johannesburg to Kimberley, which was then under British control. The city had once been a huge diamond mining center, but the mines had closed and the town was in decline. However, the De Beers Consolidated Mines Company continued to have great influence. He attended a public school and learned English. During his childhood, he became aware of the ways that different people were treated based on their race, religion, economic status, and social status. In his autobiography Time and Again, he refers to the many classes of people in his community: \"The Africans lived either in rooms in the back yards of their employers' houses or in sprawling, dusty, tatterdemalion 'locations'; the Cape Coloureds (South African name for people of mixed race) lived in their parts of town; the whites in theirs. Interspersed among these groups were smaller communities: Indians and Chinese among the non-whites, Jews and Greeks among the whites. As for the major division among the whites themselves, that between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking, or Briton and Boer.… All these peoples met in the streets, they did business with one another, but just about every aspect of their social life was severely segregated. To sit together in the same room with anyone of a darker skin than their own was a moral impossibility for most whites.\" He later recalled that many of his Jewish friends and acquaintances sympathized with the blacks in South Africa. He began to observe the ways that the government, churches, and the newspapers justified the ill treatment of blacks.\n\nAt the age of 11, an event occurred that affected Jacobson for the rest of his life. After helping a boy rescue his book bag from a filthy trash bin, he went to school unaware that he had gotten dirt on the back of his legs. When his teacher mentioned the dirt in front of the class, several of the boys made fun of him and led the class in ignoring him for six to eight weeks. He was stunned at the mob mentality, seeing how a few leaders of the class could control the actions of the entire group. Paul Gready writes in \"Research in African Literatures\": \"A childhood experience of bullying and ostracism was something from which Jacobson was 'never to wholly recover.\"'\n\nThe Jewish community in Kimberley was a strong one. More Lithuanian Jews traveled to South Africa in the early 20th century than to any other country except the United States. Many were hoping to follow in the footsteps of Sammy Marks, a Lithuanian who had made his fortune in the diamond mines. The Jewish community grew even closer together in the 1930s as Nazism rose, and they felt connected to Jews around the world.\nJacobson's parents were not particularly religious, but his father insisted that the children attend synagogue and Hebrew lessons, because, as Jacobson later wrote, \"To have done less, especially as the Nazi madness swept across Europe, would have seemed to him spineless, even treacherous.\" Jacobson attended, but usually under protest.\nJacobson attended Boys' High School in Kimberley and graduated at the age of 16. He went on to the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, where he graduated at the top of his class with a bachelor's degree in English Literature. Following his graduation in 1948, he worked as a laborer in an Israeli kibbutz for about a year. Then he got a job as a teacher at a Jewish school in London. In less than a year, he was asked to leave, according to his autobiography, because he did not know enough about Orthodox Judaism.\n\nHe returned to Johannesburg in 1951 and worked for the South African Jewish Board of Deputies as a public relations assistant and then as a journalist for \"Press Digest\". In 1952 he returned to Kimberley to work as a correspondence secretary on his father's cattle farm. During this period he became determined to be a writer. His first literary success occurred with a short story entitled \"The Box,\" which was published in \"Commentary\". It was followed by other short stories in \"Harpers Bazaar\", \"The New Yorker\", and other magazines.\n\nIn February 1954, he married Margaret Pye, whom he had met while working in London.\n\nHis first novel, \"The Trap\", was released in 1955, followed by \"A Dance in the Sun\" in 1956. Both books drawn upon his childhood experiences. Together the two books earned him a yearlong creative writing fellowship at Stanford University in California. During his time at Stanford, he completed his third novel, \"The Price of Diamonds\", which was also set in South Africa but was a lighthearted comedy-mystery with a moral message. All three books dealt with prejudice and racism.\nHe returned to England in 1957, determined to seek greater depth in his writing. In 1959, he received the John Llewelyn Rhys Award for fiction for his collection of short stories, \"A Long Way from London\". In 1960, \"The Evidence of Love\" was published. It dealt with the racism involved in a romantic relationship between a black man and a white woman who were put in prison for getting married. In 1964, he received the W. Somerset Maugham Award for his first collection of essays, \"Time of Arrival\". One of his short stories, \"The Zulu and the Zeide,\" was adapted into a musical and produced on Broadway in 1965. In 1966, he published \"The Beginners\", a longer, in-depth novel following the lives of a Jewish family after their emigration to South Africa. It was a great literary success.\n\nOver the next two decades, he continued to write while holding various teaching positions. In 1965–66, he was visiting professor at Syracuse University in New York. \"A Dance in the Sun\", his second novel, was produced as the play \"Day of the Lion\" in Cleveland in 1968. He was a Visiting Fellow at the State University of New York at Buffalo in the summer of 1971. In 1974, he became vice chair of the Literature Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. In 1981, he was a Fellow at the Humanities Research Centre at Australian National University. He also took a position at the University of London as a lecturer; from 1979 to 1987 he was a reader in English. In 1988, he became a professor of English, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1994.\n\nJacobson's first five novels all focused on South Africa. His writing focus then shifted to moral and ethical issues involving all of humanity. Although he had no interest in learning the Bible as a child, he developed a strong interest in the Old Testament as an adult. In \"The Rape of Tamar\", he retells the story of the rape of Tamar by her half-brother Amnon, the brother of Absolom. The book was adapted into a play called \"Yonadeb\", after the narrative character in the book, and was produced in London in 1985.\n\nIn \"The Story of Stories: The Chosen People and its God\", he provided a study of the Bible. His goal was to have a textual analysis as a narrative. The book was criticized by many Jews, probably because he refers to God as \"an imaginative creation.\"\nThemes that continued to reveal themselves in his works included race relations, class consciousness, human nature, universal traits, group mentality, corruption, betrayal, guilt, power, and social morality. In an article that he wrote for Commentary in 2000, entitled \"My Jewish Childhood,\" Jacobson said: \"It is always going to be difficult to get socially and racially diverse people to live harmoniously together within a single polity.\"\nIn 1985, his autobiography, \"Time and Again: Autobiographical Essays\", was published. Each of the 13 chapters tells of an event in his life that shaped his way of thinking about the human race. The book won the J.R. Ackerly Prize for autobiography.\n\"The God-Fearer\", published in 1992, is a story of persecution. Jews are in the majority and oppress a group called the \"Christers.\" In a Washington Post article, Anne Roiphe observed: \"By making the majority Jewish, Jacobson makes it clear that power is the source of oppression: not that the power is German or Christian, but that it has the weight of numbers. … The horror of the story lies not in gruesome details or heated prose, but in the calm truth of what we call normal behavior when we try to save our skin at any cost.\"\n\nIn the middle 1990s, Jacobson turned to nonfiction. In 1994 he published \"The Electronic Elephant: A South African Journey\" about his travels back to South Africa to observe the changes in the land and the culture since his childhood. In 1998, \"Heshel's Kingdom\" provided a moving story of his travels to Lithuania to learn more about the life of his grandfather. He started with his grandfather's identity document, spectacles, an address book, an old photograph, and the memories of relatives. Sadly, he found no trace of his grandfather, and, indeed, not even the cemetery he was buried in remained. He did find that in 1941, within six weeks' time, the Nazis essentially wiped out the Lithuanian Jewish community, killing 210,000.\n\nHis early novels, including \"The Trap\", his first published novel, focus on South African themes. His later works have been various in kind: they include works of fantasy and fictional treatments of historical episodes, as well as memoirs, critical essays, and travel books. Among the awards and prizes he has received are the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize 1959 (\"A Long Way from London and Other Stories\"); Somerset Maugham Award 1964 (\"Time of Arrival and Other Essays\"); The Jewish Chronicle Award 1977 (\"The Confessions of Josef Baisz\"); the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography 1986 (\"Time and Time Again\"). In 2000 he edited and translated from the Dutch \"Een mond vol Glas\" by Henk van Woerden, an imaginative re-creation of the circumstances leading to the assassination of the South African president Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, in the country's House of Assembly. His 2005 novel \"All For Love\" was long listed for the Man Booker Prize.\n\nDan Jacobson received an Honorary D. Litt. from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and on retirement from his position at University College London was elected a Fellow of the college. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2007.\n\nCollections of his papers can be found at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, Austin, Texas; Oxford University, England; and, in South Africa, at Witwatersrand University Library, Johannesburg, the National English Literary Museum, Grahamstown, and the Africana Library, Kimberley. \nHe died in London on 12 June 2014.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of his book \"Austerlitz\", W. G. Sebald has his eponymous protagonist take from his rucksack a copy of Dan Jacobson's \"Heshel's Kingdom\" (1998), the account of Jacobson's journey in the 1990s to Lithuania in search of traces of his grandfather Heshel's world. The orthodox rabbi Heshel Melamed's sudden death in 1919 had provided an opportunity for his widow and nine children to leave Lithuania for South Africa, which, in light of events two decades later, ironically, had been a gift of life. \"On his travels in Lithuania Jacobson finds scarcely any trace of his forebears, only signs everywhere of the annihilation from which Heshel's weak heart had preserved his immediate family when it stopped beating.\"\n\n"}

NAT traversal techniques are typically required for client-to-client networking applications on the Internet involving hosts connected in private networks, especially in peer-to-peer, Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployments.\n\nUDP hole punching establishes connectivity between two hosts communicating across one or more network address translators. Typically, third-party hosts on the public transit network are used to establish UDP port states that may be used for direct communications between the communicating hosts. Once port state has been successfully established and the hosts are communicating, port state may be maintained either by normal communications traffic, or in the prolonged absence thereof, by keep-alive packets, usually consisting of empty UDP packets or packets with minimal non-intrusive content.\n\nUDP hole punching is a method for establishing bidirectional UDP connections between Internet hosts in private networks using network address translators. The technique is not applicable in all scenarios or with all types of NATs, as NAT operating characteristics are not standardized.\n\nHosts with network connectivity inside a private network connected via a NAT to the Internet typically use the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) method or Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to determine the public address of the NAT that its communications peers require. In this process another host on the public network is used to establish port mapping and other UDP port state that is assumed to be valid for direct communication between the application hosts. Since UDP state usually expires after short periods of time in the range of tens of seconds to a few minutes, and the UDP port is closed in the process, UDP hole punching employs the transmission of periodic \"keep-alive\" packets, each renewing the life-time counters in the UDP state machine of the NAT.\n\nUDP hole punching will not work with symmetric NAT devices (also known as bi-directional NAT) which tend to be found in large corporate networks. In symmetric NAT, the NAT's mapping associated with the connection to the well-known STUN server is restricted to receiving data from the well-known server, and therefore the NAT mapping the well-known server sees is not useful information to the endpoint.\n\nIn a somewhat more elaborate approach both hosts will start sending to each other, using multiple attempts. On a Restricted Cone NAT, the first packet from the other host will be blocked. After that the NAT device has a record of having sent a packet to the other machine, and will let any packets coming from this IP address and port number through. This technique is widely used in peer-to-peer software and Voice over Internet Protocol telephony. It can also be used to assist the establishment of virtual private networks operating over UDP. The same technique is sometimes extended to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections, though with less success because TCP connection streams are controlled by the host OS, not the application, and sequence numbers are selected randomly; thus any NAT device that performs sequence-number checking will not consider the packets to be associated with an existing connection and drop them.\n\nLet A and B be the two hosts, each in its own private network; N and N are the two NAT devices with globally reachable IP addresses EIP and EIP respectively; S is a public server with a well-known, globally reachable IP address.\n\n"}

She is best known for her popular rhyming stories for children, especially those illustrated by Axel Scheffler, which include \"The Gruffalo\", \"Room on the Broom\" and \"Stick Man\". She originally wrote songs for children's television but has concentrated on writing books since the words of one of her songs, \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", were made into a children's book in 1993. Of her 184 published works, 64 are widely available in bookshops. The remaining 120 are intended for school use and include her Songbirds phonic reading scheme, which is part of the Oxford University Press's Oxford Reading Tree.\n\nDonaldson was born in London and brought up in Hampstead, London, with her younger sister Mary. The family occupied a Victorian three-storey house near Hampstead Heath. Her parents, sister and their pet cat Geoffrey lived on the ground floor, an aunt and uncle (and later their children, James and Kate) on the first floor and her grandmother on the second floor.\n\nDonaldson's parents, James (always known as Jerry) and Elizabeth, met shortly before the Second World War, which then separated them for six years. Jerry, who had studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford University, spent most of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp where his knowledge of German earned him the position of an interpreter. Elizabeth, also a good German speaker with a degree in languages, meanwhile did war work in the Wrens.\n\nAfter the war, they were reunited and married, and in 1950 they bought the Hampstead house together with Jerry's mother, his sister Beta and her husband Chris (the two men had met in the P.O.W. camp). When Donaldson was six her father contracted polio and thereafter was confined to a wheelchair, though he still led an active life, working as a lecturer in the Maudsley Hospital's Institute of Psychiatry, where he pioneered genetic studies using the model of identical twins brought up apart.\n\nElizabeth worked as a part-time secretary and helped her boss, Leslie Minchin, translate German lieder into English. It was a household of music and song: Elizabeth sang with the Hampstead Choral Society, Jerry played the cello in amateur string quartets, and both parents were active members of the Hampstead Music Club. Summer holidays were at Grittleton House in Wiltshire, where Jerry played his cello in a summer school for chamber music, while Julia and Mary romped around and put on musical shows with the other children.\n\nPoetry also featured strongly in Donaldson's early life; she was given \"The Book of a Thousand Poems\" by her father when she was five years old, and her grandmother introduced her to Edward Lear’s nonsense rhymes. Donaldson attended New End Primary School and then Camden School for Girls. During her childhood and adolescence she acted (understudying the fairies in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at The Old Vic where she made the acquaintance of a young Judi Dench and Tom Courtenay), sang with the Children's Opera Group, and learned the piano.\n\nA good linguist, she learned French and German at school and later picked up Italian through a summer tutoring job with a family in Naples, so that by the age of 19 she had a good grasp of all three languages.\n\nDonaldson studied Drama and French at Bristol University (1967–1970), graduating with a 2:1 honours degree. During her time there she acted in departmental productions and learnt the guitar. In 1968, she and her friend Maureen Purkis took part in the play \"I am not the Eiffel Tower\" with music composed by Colin Sell, an accomplished young pianist who was studying Spanish and Portuguese at Bristol and who has gone on to appear in BBC Radio 4's \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\". Sell's roommate Malcolm Donaldson, a medical student who played left-handed guitar and was a keen amateur actor, came to see the show and subsequently teamed up with Sell, Donaldson and Purkis to sing in the pubs during Bristol University Rag Week in early 1969. Almost immediately after this Donaldson and Purkis were seconded to live in Paris for six months as part of their degree course where they sang and played their guitars to café audiences for money. Malcolm joined them in the summer and the trio performed various songs by the Beatles and from musicals including \"Hair\".\n\nAfter several weeks of busking in Paris, Malcolm followed Julia and Maureen to the Avignon Festival. Here his attempts to sleep on their youth hostel floor led to eviction and the trio moved out, sleeping in a camp site and even a field, by which time a deep friendship had been formed. During their time in Paris the group were spotted by a French entrepreneur who auditioned them. While nothing came of this Donaldson and Purkis penned a tune to the traditional French poem \"Metamorphosis\" specifically for the audition, the first time that Donaldson had composed a song for an occasion (apart from the childhood shows).\n\nBy December 1969 Julia and Malcolm had become an item. They began to supply cabaret for the occasional university social event, and in 1970 they visited America, travelling by Greyhound bus from the East to the West coast and busking in Seattle and San Francisco. On their return the duo played in restaurants and began to participate in events as diverse as the Crystal Palace Children's Day, an Easter Parade in London and a dental congress dinner – with Julia Donaldson composing songs specially for these occasions.\n\nThe couple continued to busk in Europe during holidays, including in France and Italy, with Julia Donaldson writing \"The French Busking Song\" in French, and \"The Spaghetti Song\" in Italian. By 1971, Donaldson was working in London at Michael Joseph publishers as a secretary to Anthea Joseph but was also given considerable leeway as a junior editor. At weekends she and Malcolm took part in the Bristol Street Theatre, a group of mainly postgraduate students inspired by the late playwright David Illingworth. The group devised simple, unscripted plays which could be performed in the playgrounds of poor council estates and which recruited children from the audience to take over some of the roles. This was to have a lasting effect on Donaldson's interaction with children in her own shows as an established children's writer.\n\nThe couple were married in September 1972, Donaldson composing an operetta which she and Malcolm, their best man Colin Sell, the bridesmaids and ushers performed at the reception in Burgh House, Hampstead. A picture of the wedding is on display in the house today. Donaldson then worked as a secretary in Radio Bristol where she also had a weekly slot as short story producer/editor. In August 1974 the couple moved to Brighton where Donaldson had been appointed as editor at Robert Tyndall, a small book publishers. Shortly before this she had sent a tape of songs to BBC Children's Television, and between 1974 and 1978 she wrote regularly for the programme \"Play Away\", her songs being performed by actors and musicians including Toni Arthur, Floella Benjamin, Johnny Ball, Brian Cant, Derek Griffiths and musical director Jonathan Cohen. She also wrote occasional songs for \"Play School\" and for the \"Watch with Mother\" programme \"Play Board\". Some of Donaldson's songs – \"The Luck of the Game\", \"Funny Face\" and \"A Squash and a Squeeze\" – were recorded at this time for BBC albums.\n\nJulia and Malcolm were involved in the Brighton folk club scene, performing floor spots of comedy songs written by Donaldson, often within days of being composed. The songs were variously influenced by Flanders and Swann, topical affairs and traditional folk tales (the latter inspiring spoofs such as \"The Ballad of Jack Nancy and Fred\", and \"Folk Alphabet\"). Their vinyl album \"First Fourteen\"(1977) featured many of these songs, while others were included much later on the CD \"Second Fourteen\" (2006, when \"First Fourteen\" was also re-mastered as a CD).\n\nDonaldson composed two musicals for children: \"King Grunt's Cake\" (1976) and \"Pirate on the Pier\" (1980) which she and a small cast performed both in London and Brighton. Influenced by their Bristol Street Theatre experience, Donaldson ran a Saturday-morning workshop for children in Portslade from 1974 to 1976. During these sessions a simple play would be devised, followed by making of props and costumes, rehearsal and then a performance.\n\nIn 1977/6 Donaldson studied at Brighton College of Education for a Postgraduate Certificate in Education and worked for two years as an English teacher at St Mary's Hall in Brighton until the arrival of their first child Hamish in 1978, after which she never returned to full-time employment. The couple moved to Lyon in France for a year (1979–80) with Hamish, returning to Brighton where their second son Alastair was born in 1981.\n\nIn 1983 the family of four moved to Bristol where Malcolm Donaldson was appointed as Senior Registrar in Paediatrics to United Bristol Hospitals. By then the television writing had dried up and the folk scene had waned. Julia Donaldson wrote and sang a few topical songs for adult radio programmes (including one about the Guinness Distillers take-over bid, which appeared on Financial World Tonight), did occasional amateur acting and street theatre, and wrote the songs for the Kingsdown community play \"Nine Trees Shade\". She also became a volunteer in Hamish's primary school, hearing the children read aloud. She devised short plays with the right number of parts for a reading group, rotating the roles until each child had read the whole play. The piece would then be performed to the entire class. This approach seemed to build confidence in reading aloud as well as being enjoyable, and Donaldson stored the plays in a drawer for possible future use.\n\nIn 1989 Malcolm was appointed to Glasgow University as senior lecturer in child health and the family, now five following the arrival of Jesse in 1987, moved to Bearsden.\n\nOnce in Glasgow, Donaldson 'pitched' once again for song-writing commissions with the BBC. Between 1990 and 1994 she wrote for various programmes including \"Thinkabout Science\" (two series) and \"Playdays\", composing songs for presenters and puppets (such as Lizzie and the Whybird) to sing.\n\nIn 1991 Donaldson was contacted by Methuen Publishing to ask if the words of her song \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", which she had written for the BBC's \"Playboard\" programme in 1975, could be made into a picture book for children. The book was published in 1993, with illustrations by a German artist Axel Scheffler, who was living in London. Publication of \"A Squash and a Squeeze\" was a pivotal event for Donaldson . It made her realise that her song-writing talent could be applied to story-writing, and gave her the confidence to open her drawer of simple plays for schoolchildren and to send some samples to an educational publisher. Between 1993 and 1999 she wrote extensively for Heinemann and Ginn, including plays such as \"Birthday Surprise\" for younger classes and \"Top of the Mops\" for reluctant teenage readers, as well as re-tellings of traditional tales. During this time Donaldson started visiting Scottish schools and libraries, occasionally accompanied by Malcolm Donaldson and his guitar.\n\nFrom the 1990s when Donaldson was extensively visiting school and libraries, she extended techniques learned in Bristol and Brighton to encourage children to act and sing with her. Following the publication of \"The Gruffalo\" she was invited to book festivals, participating in the Edinburgh International Book Festival every year from 1999 onwards, and appearing regularly at Hay, Cheltenham and Bath festivals, as well as at many theatres.\n\nIn 1995, while looking for ideas for an educational series of plays based on traditional tales, Donaldson came across a version of a Chinese story about a little girl who escapes being eaten by a tiger by claiming to be the fearsome Queen of the Jungle and inviting him to walk behind her. The tiger misinterprets the terror of the various animals they meet as being related to her rather than him, and flees. Donaldson sensed that this story could be developed into more than an educational item and returned to it later as a possible basis for a picture book. She decided to make the girl a mouse, and chose a fox, owl and snake as woodland rather than jungle creatures but wasn't satisfied with lines like \"They ought to know, they really should / There aren't any tigers in this wood\".\n\nShe then thought of the idea of a monster whose name would end in O (to rhyme with \"doesn't he know\"). \"Gr\" sounded suitably fierce as the start to the monster's name, and filling in the middle with \"uffal\" gave the name Gruffalo, conjuring up the pleasing image of a monster reminiscent of a buffalo but a lot more scary. Even then, \"The Gruffalo\" proved nigh impossible to write but, encouraged by her son Alastair, Donaldson persisted with her idea that the monster, rather than existing in the Deep Dark Wood from the outset, should be a figment of the Mouse's imagination, employed to scare off the fox, owl and snake but then turning out to be a reality. A further objection to the original draft was made by Jesse (by now called Jerry) who asked, \"Mum, why don't the fox, owl and snake just eat the mouse on the spot?\" This flaw was resolved by inserting the question \"Where are you meeting him? (The Gruffalo)\" and the reply \"Here, by these rocks / And his favourite food is roasted fox\", with similar lines for the remaining two predators.\n\n\"The Gruffalo\" was sent to Reid Books in 1995. Donaldson sent the text to Axel Scheffler, whom she had met only once or twice, briefly, following the publication of \"A Squash and a Squeeze\". Within days Macmillan Children's Books made an offer to publish \"The Gruffalo\", which was illustrated by Scheffler and published in 1999.\n\n\"The Gruffalo\" was an immediate success, going on to win several awards, including the Smarties Prize (1999). It has subsequently been translated into more than 40 languages, sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and has given rise to stage and screen productions by Tall Stories and Magic Light Pictures. \"The Gruffalo\" was followed by more Donaldson/Scheffler publications by Macmillan: \"Monkey Puzzle\" (2000), \"Room on the Broom\" (2001), \"The Smartest Giant in Town\" (2002), \"The Snail and the Whale\" (2003), \"The Gruffalo's Child\", featuring an only child Gruffalo with a wooden stick doll plus the original cast of Gruffalo, Mouse, Fox, Snake and Owl (2004), and \"Charlie Cook's Favourite Book\" (2005). In 2006 Scheffler moved to Alison Green Books who published the duo's \"Tiddler\" (2007), \"Stick Man\" (inspired by the Gruffalo's Child's toy) (2008), \"Tabby McTat\" (2009), \"Zog\" (2010), \"The Highway Rat\" (2011), \"Superworm\" (2012) and \"The Scarecrows' Wedding\" (2014).\n\nSince publication of \"The Gruffalo\", Donaldson has worked with other illustrators including Lydia Monks, David Roberts and Nick Sharratt, who has also illustrated two books of poems by Donaldson, \"Crazy Mayonnaisy Mum\" and \"Wriggle and Roar\". Lydia Monks has illustrated the \"Princess Mirror-Belle\" trilogy, a series of books for 7- to 10-year-olds about a boastful girl who is the mirror reflection of an ordinary girl called Ellen. The inspiration for Mirror-Belle was Hamish's imaginary childhood friend Sammy, who lived behind a wardrobe mirror.\n\nDonaldson is also the author of \"The Giants\" and the \"Joneses\" for children aged 8–12 years. Her teenage novel \"Running on the Cracks\" is set in Glasgow and traces the adventures of orphaned half-Chinese Leo (aged 15) who is fleeing from her dodgy uncle in England and trying to find her father's estranged family. She befriends a schoolboy called Finlay, who is loosely based on Donaldson's youngest son Jerry during his days as a paper boy. \"Running on the Cracks\", whose element of mental illness is drawn from Hamish's hospital experiences won the Nasen award in 2011 for its sympathetic and inclusive portrait of Mary, who befriends Leo but then descends into a severe relapse of her bi-polar condition.\n\nDonaldson has also written a phonic reading scheme of short stories comprising 60 books of \"Songbird Phonics\", published by Oxford University Press.\n\nA typical public event consists of acting out (more or less word-for-word) four stories, and singing three or four songs (mostly from Donaldson's three albums of songs – \"The Gruffalo Song and Other Songs\", \"Room on the Broom and Other Songs\" and \"The Gruffalo's Child and Other Songs\"). There is always a strong element of audience participation, with children (and sometimes their parents) invited on stage to act parts in the stories. Malcolm Donaldson almost always takes part in the events, and they are also often joined by other performers including family members.\n\nDonaldson has also performed jointly with her illustrators, particularly Axel Scheffler and Lydia Monks. She has performed the Donaldson/Scheffler books not only in English but also in German on several tours and at the Berlin Festival. In 2007, when Malcolm took a sabbatical from his job, he joined Julia on a World Tour, acting and singing in Bermuda, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and America.\n\nIn 2011, Donaldson was appointed Children's Laureate succeeding the illustrator Anthony Browne. In keeping with her interest in acting and singing Donaldson has set out to encourage children to perform poetry, plays and dramatised readings to generate a love of books and of reading. Accordingly, she has created a series of \"Plays to Read\" for six characters to be performed in the classroom, written by herself and by other writers such as Geraldine McCaughrean, Jeanne Willis, Vivian French, Steve Skidmore and Steve Barlow. The first 36 of these plays, for early readers, were published by Pearson (2013) with a further 24 plays for older primary-school children to following later in the year. She has also compiled an anthology of \"Poems to Perform\" by groups of children (to be published by Macmillan in 2013) and has created an interactive website called picturebookplays.co.uk which gives guidance as to how selected picture books can be turned into classroom plays.\n\nIn her laureate role Donaldson has campaigned passionately against library cuts and closures, writing articles, meeting ministers and – with Malcolm Donaldson – embarking on a 6-week tour of UK libraries in autumn 2012. In all of the 38 libraries the visiting children were requested to perform a short play or song based on a picture book, as well as joining in Donaldson's own stories and songs. The tour was designed to celebrate libraries but also to generate publicity about the plight of some of them.\n\nDonaldson's husband is a consultant paediatrician. The couple previously resided in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire and, in 2014, moved to Steyning, West Sussex. The eldest of the Donaldson's three sons, Hamish, took his own life in 2003 at the age of 25.\n\nDonaldson is a patron of ArtLink Central, a charity which places artists in disadvantaged communities, and of Bookbug, a programme run by the Scottish Book Trust and funded by the Scottish Government, which gifts over 500,000 books to children aged 0–5 in Scotland every year, encouraging parents to share books with their children from birth. In addition she is a patron of Storybook Dads, a UK charity which helps serving prisoners to send recordings of themselves reading bedtime stories to their children in order to maintain connections with some of the 200,000 children affected by parental imprisonment. She is also patron of Monmouth's Savoy Cinema.\n\nShe was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to literature. She was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours.\n\nShe was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Bristol in 2011 and the University of Glasgow in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A right-handed opening batsman, he originally hails from Australia and captained their Under-19 side for two Under-19 Tests in 1989 and 1990. He played three Test matches for England but disappointed, with a highest score of 28 runs in six innings. Gallian was a county professional for fifteen years, previously playing for Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He signed a two-year deal to play for Essex until 2009, and scored 171 on his Championship debut for the county.\n\nIn September 2005, Gallian became the first player to have twice been dismissed for 199 in first-class cricket when he was run out against Kent. His previous dismissal for that score had been in April of the same season against Sussex, and on that occasion he was also run out. Early in his career he, along with Graham Thorpe, was heralded as a brilliant prospect for England, but as his record suggests, while Gallian may have had the talent to play Test cricket, he apparently lacked the temperament.\n\nGallian was born at Manly, New South Wales and captained the Australian under-19 side against its English counterpart in 1989. He was educated at Keble College, Oxford, reading Diplomacy and Social Studies, which he described as \"a course that allowed me time to play cricket in my third year\". He played for Oxford University 1990–1993, captaining in the Varsity Match in 1993 and scoring 115 and 53 not out. During this time Gallian frequently opened both the batting and the bowling, though his medium-paced bowling has since only been used in partnership-breaking capacities. Gallian began his first-class career at Lancashire and his innings of 312 was the highest score at Old Trafford.\n\nAfter Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, batsman Kevin Pietersen requested a release from his contract, stating he was unhappy at the club. This led to a public row with Gallian, then the captain of the club, during which Gallian allegedly threw Pietersen's kit off the Trent Bridge balcony and broke his bat:\n\nDuring the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, \"if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.\" I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology. Pietersen was forced to complete the last year of his contract with Nottinghamshire, but \"didn't enjoy it at all\".\n\nWhen Gallian's contract with Nottinghamshire expired at the end of 2007, he signed a two-year contract with Essex. Essex chose to give Gallian a contract to provide experience to their young squad. David East, the club's chief executive, said \"He has a very impressive record and his vast experience will greatly assist our young and exciting batsmen to develop over the next few years. Jason is very excited about this next stage in his career and is looking forward to joining what he describes as a young and vibrant squad that is going places\".\n\nGallian announced his retirement from cricket in August 2009, having made five first-class appearances for Essex during the 2009 season.\n\nGallian now plays club cricket for Saffron Walden and is the head of cricket at Felsted School, Essex, where he qualified to become a geography teacher.\n"}
{"id": "2304453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304453", "title": "Bernard Fanning", "text": "Bernard Fanning\n\nBernard Fanning (born 15 August 1969) is an Australian musician and singer-songwriter. He was the lead vocalist of Queensland alternative rock band Powderfinger from its formation in 1989 to its dissolution in 2010.\n\nBorn and raised in Toowong, Brisbane, Fanning was taught the piano by his mother at an early age. At the age of 15, while attending St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, he began writing music. Upon graduating from St. Joseph's Fanning moved on to the University of Queensland, where he studied journalism for a short time. He dropped out to pursue a music career, after meeting Ian Haug in an economics class. Fanning joined Haug, John Collins, and Steven Bishop, who had recently formed Powderfinger, and took the role of lead singer. After Bishop left and guitarist Darren Middleton joined, the band released five studio albums in fifteen years and achieved mainstream success in Australia. During Powderfinger's hiatus in 2005, Fanning began his solo music career with the studio album \"Tea & Sympathy\". Powderfinger reunited in 2007 and released two more albums before disbanding in late 2010.\n\nWhile Powderfinger's style focuses on alternative rock, Fanning's solo music is generally described as a mixture of blues and acoustic folk. He plays guitar, piano, keyboards, and harmonica both when performing solo and also with Powderfinger. Often speaking out against Australian political figures, Fanning has donated much of his time to philanthropic causes. He is an advocate for Aboriginal justice in Australia.\n\nFanning was born in Brisbane on 15 August 1969. He was raised with two brothers and a sister in an Irish Catholic family in the inner Brisbane suburb of Toowong. The death of one of Fanning's brothers from cancer would be the inspiration for \"Vulture Street\"s \"Since You've Been Gone\". Fanning's mother began teaching him to play piano as a young child, although his siblings were not interested in music.\n\nFanning attended St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, and began writing his own music at the age of 15. Fanning has described these early works as \"terrible\", but notes that he enjoyed writing and arranging them. After graduating from St Joseph's, Fanning entered the University of Queensland to study journalism; however, he was equally interested in pursuing a music career, and left university at the age of 19 to do so.\n\nFanning first met Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug in a University of Queensland economics class in 1989. Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that, \"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.\"\n\nIn 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.\n\nThroughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity of the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the Australian music industry. In 2003, Fanning was called upon by film-maker Gregor Jordan to perform the folk song \"Moreton Bay\" (named after the bay in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition \"Shelter for My Soul\" in his film \"Ned Kelly\". Fanning then enlisted Jordan to film Powderfinger's first live DVD, \"\".\n\nOn 31 October 2005, Fanning released his debut solo album entitled \"Tea & Sympathy\". It debuted at number one on the Australian ARIA Albums chart, and spent 58 weeks in the top 50. It peaked at number 11 during its 18-week stay on the New Zealand albums chart.\n\n\"Tea & Sympathy\" included songs Fanning had written in his time with Powderfinger, as well as new material written after the band went on hiatus. Most of the writing was done in what Fanning described as a \"creative burst\" between March and May 2005. Much of the inspiration for the work on the album came from Fanning's reaction to the death of his brother in 2002, and to the ending of a 12-year relationship with his girlfriend, Philippa Sison. Most of the album was recorded at Real World Studios with Tchad Blake in June 2005, except for \"Not Finished Just Yet\", \"Believe\", \"Wash Me Clean\", and \"Hope & Validation\", which were recorded at Fanning's Brisbane home. Fanning was supported by musicians Jerry Marotta, Keith Duffy, and John Bedggood, who also formed part of his live band. The album was developed in a relaxed manner, with Fanning stating, \"We had a ball putting the songs together.\"\n\nThree singles were released from the album. The most successful of these was the lead single, \"Wish You Well\", followed shortly by \"Songbird\". These releases were only sold as digital download singles. The album's third single, \"Watch Over Me\", was the only one to be released as a CD single and achieved minor success on the Australian singles chart. It entered the chart on 9 July 2006 at number 16 spending eight weeks in the top 50. On 26 January 2006, \"Wish You Well\" was voted number one for the 2005 Triple J Hottest 100. Following \"Watch Over Me\", Fanning digitally released a fourth single \"Weekend of Mystery\". It was not officially on the album but was included on the album available from the iTunes Store. Fanning took home the award for Best Video at the 2006 ARIA Awards for \"Wish You Well\".\n\nOn 2 December 2005, Fanning announced a nationwide Which Way Home Concert Tour, named after the song on the album of the same name. Fanning played seven shows between 25 February and 10 March 2006, in each of Australia's major capital cities. He was supported by Perth band The Panics and Brisbane singer Andrew Morris. He followed this with the Yesterday's Gone tour, announced on 11 August 2006, which concluded with Powderfinger re-uniting and returning to the recording studio. Fanning later said that while he enjoyed making \"Tea & Sympathy\", \"Powderfinger is my real job\".\n\nThroughout 2006, Fanning had hinted Powderfinger would end their hiatus and release a sixth studio album. Recorded in Los Angeles, \"Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\" was released on 2 June 2007. The title of the album came from a chapter of \"Brooklyn Follies\" by Paul Auster, a book that Fanning had read during recording. The album debuted at number one on the Australian ARIA Albums chart.\n\nPowderfinger toured Australia and New Zealand with Silverchair on their Across the Great Divide tour in 2007. The tour's aim was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia to reduce the 17-year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians. Fanning said of the tour, \"The idea is to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation.\"\n\nAfter the disbanding of Powderfinger, Fanning moved to Madrid for 18 months with his family, where he began writing for his next solo album before moving to Brisbane in 2013. \"Departures\" was released in June 2013, with the recording work done in Los Angeles, between leaving Spain and returning to Australia.\n\nFanning released his third studio album \"Civil Dusk\" on 5 August 2016. It was preceded by the single \"Wasting Time\". \"Civil Dusk\" is released as part one of a series of two albums, the second being \"Brutal Dawn\".\n\nFanning has been described as having a strong vocal range when singing, but has said he is not highly confident in his voice. In a 1998 interview, Fanning said, \"I don't think I have the perfect voice or anything\", and said that delivering the song's message was more important than \"showing off [his] chops\". He said he was not interested in singing for the purpose of singing alone, but rather because he enjoyed getting the purpose of the song across. Fanning has said: \"For me, writing songs comes from anywhere\", drawing inspiration from his experiences.\n\nIn his work on \"Tea & Sympathy\", Fanning referred to his inability to play guitar solos leading to different elements becoming a focus of the songs. In an interview, he said, \"I wasn't relying on solos to be big features because I simply can't play them.\" Fanning explained that the songs' shorter length was due to not having \"four other people\" to back him up when producing independently.\n\nFanning has said his favourite band is The Beatles.\n\nFanning has said that although political messages may be common throughout his and Powderfinger's music, it is not his central focus when writing songs: \"A balance has to be struck in a lot of ways, in the sense that primarily I'm a musician. I'm not a political commentator. So if I write a song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto my record. And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement.\" He has said he has no interest in \"doing a 'Peter Garrett'\", referring to the Midnight Oil front man who entered politics after a successful musical career.\n\nOn 8 July 2007, Fanning wrote a piece for Adelaide's \"Sunday Mail\", describing his recent trip to Uluru. In the piece, he criticised those who climbed the rock, saying he was \"appalled that kids were being taught to disrespect the wishes of Aboriginal people on their own land\". Upon returning from Uluru, Fanning wrote \"Black Tears\", which \"document[ed] a relationship gone wrong\". In his piece, Fanning also criticised the 17-year life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, and encouraged all to join a conversation on reconciliation.\n\nFanning takes a left-leaning political stance, although he claims he is not fond of discussing the issue. Rather, he attempts to discuss the issues through his songs. \"I approach writing a song about something like [Aboriginal affairs] the same way I would approach writing a song about a relationship, because it's something that I feel strongly about.\" However, he has occasionally stated his views on social and political issues, giving \"The Dominion Post\" his stance on Aboriginal affairs in light of the Across the Great Divide tour:\nFanning has performed numerous philanthropic tasks independently and with Powderfinger. The band played at the 2005 WaveAid concert to raise money for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the Across the Great Divide tour in 2007 to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia. Fanning has contributed to charities including A Just Australia and Youngcare Australia, and donates his time to youth detention centres in Brisbane running songwriting workshops. In an uncharacteristic outburst, Fanning once referred to fellow Australian artist Ben Lee as \"a precocious little cunt\", after Lee referred to himself as \"the saviour of Australian music\". Fanning later apologised for the comment.\n\nFanning married Andrea Moreno in February 2007 in Brisbane. Moreno is from Spain, where the two met while Fanning was writing and recording \"Tea & Sympathy\" in Europe. This relationship followed a twelve-year union Fanning had had with his previous girlfriend. It was this break-up (along with the then-recent death of his older brother) which influenced much of the lyrical content and sombre atmospheric mood of \"Tea & Sympathy\". Through Moreno, Fanning has learned to speak some Spanish. Fanning and Moreno have performed together while Powderfinger was on hiatus and Fanning was touring as a solo artist.\n\nFanning is a supporter of cricket and National Rugby League (NRL) club the Brisbane Broncos.\n\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA).\n\n"}

He has also authored/illustrated the \"Pip and Posy\" series of books for children.\n\nScheffler was born in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1957. He began studying the History of Art at the University of Hamburg but dropped out, deciding instead to do alternative National Service, caring for the mentally ill. He moved to England in 1982, at the age of 25, to study Visual Communications at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, Wiltshire. The course also included an exchange to Cooper Union in New York. It was during these years (1982–1984) that Scheffler decided to become an illustrator.\n\nScheffler worked in advertising and publishing after graduating in 1985. During this time he lived at Streatham Hill in London and soon began children's illustrating. The first book he illustrated was \"The Piemakers\" by Helen Cresswell, in 1988. Since then, he has drawn his distinctive illustrations for authors of children's books from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, including, in addition to Julia Donaldson, Jon Blake, Paul Shipton, David Henry Wilson, Uwe Timm, Paul van Loon and Toon Tellegen.\n\nScheffler was commissioned by Faber and Faber to provide new illustrations for a new edition of \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\" that commemorated the 70th anniversary of the book and the 80th anniversary of the company, which was published in October 2009.\n\nHe illustrated Gordon Brown's 2006 Christmas cards and all seven Christmas 2012 stamps designed by Webb & Webb Design Limited for Royal Mail.\n\nScheffler lives in Blackheath, London.\n\n"}

The name is traditionally given by a Buddhist monastic, and is given to newly ordained monks, nuns and laity. Dharma names are considered aspirational, not descriptive. \n\nMost of the well-known Buddhist teachers are known to have had many different Dharma names in the course of their careers, and often each name represents a stage of their career. For example, Prince Shotoku was also known as Prince Umayado and Prince Kamitsumiya. Shinran's original name was Matsuwakamaru; he was also known as Hanen, Shakku, Zenshin, Gutoku Shinran and Kenshin Daeshi. Nichiren's original name was Zennichi and his dharma names were Zenshobo Rencho and Rissho Daishi. Similarly, the tradition of various Dharma names was also used by Zen monks, who also used art to promote Buddhism. The famous monk-painter Hokusai was also known as Shunro, Kako, Sori, Taito, Iitsu, Gakyojin and Manji. Even the famous Samurai Miyamoto Musashi had several names, including the Dharma name Niten Doraku and the birthname Miyamoto Masana. The zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh also has used various Dharma names in the course of his career.\n\nIf the student doesn't have a relationship with the monastic teacher and the ceremony is a public one with a congregation present, their new name will tend to reflect the lineage/tradition rather than the individual person. When it is given by a monastic who knows the disciple, however, the name is often tailor-made.\n\nDharma names are generally given in the language of the particular sangha where the name is bestowed. People in the Karma Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism are often given the name Karma.\n\nIn Burmese Buddhism, Dhamma names (\"bwe\") are in Pali and chosen by the head monk of the monastery in which one is ordained. The traditional Burmese naming system, in which the monastic's day of birth stipulates the first letter of one's name, is used to select the name.\n\nIn China, ordained monks and nuns automatically revert to using the surname \"Shi\" (釋) as in \"Shijiamouni\" (釋迦牟尼), the Chinese transliteration of Shakyamuni Buddha. Vietnam also follows this tradition for its monks and nuns by changing their surname to \"Thích\" as in \"Thích Ca Mâu Ni\", the Sino-Vietnamese name for Shakyamuni. Likewise for the Sino-Mahayana tradition of Buddhism, the dharma name given upon ordination can reflect the lineage passed from the teacher to the student, this can result in being given several dharma names: one for usage publicly, one used especially to reflect the transmitted lineage, and a second dharma name that can also be used.\n\nIn Japan, other than the standard usage of dharma names for monastics and laity, it is also tradition for the deceased to receive a dharma name (戒名, kaimyō; literally \"precept name\") written in kanji from the priest. This name supposedly prevents the return of the deceased if his name is called. The length of the name depends also on either the virtue of the person's lifespan, or more commonly, the size of the donation of the relatives to the temple, which may range from a generally common name to the most elaborate names for 1 million yen or more. The high prices charged by the temples are a controversial issue in Japan, especially since some temples put pressure on families to buy a more expensive name.\n\nIn the Shaolin Temple, each subsequent generation takes the first part of their given name from a 70-character poem written by Xueting Fuyu. For example, the 32nd character in the poem is \"Xing\" (行), and all Shaolin Temple monks and disciples of that generation have the name Shi Xing ___.\n\n"}

The internal network devices communicate with hosts on the external network by changing the source address of outgoing requests to that of the NAT device and relaying replies back to the originating device.\n\nThis leaves the internal network ill-suited for hosting servers, as the NAT device has no automatic method of determining the internal host for which incoming packets are destined. This is not a problem for general web access and email. However, applications such as peer-to-peer file sharing, VoIP services, and video game consoles require clients to be servers as well. Incoming requests cannot be easily correlated to the proper internal host. Furthermore, many of these types of services carry IP address and port number information in the application data, potentially requiring substitution with deep packet inspection.\n\nNetwork address translation technologies are not standardized. As a result, the methods used for NAT traversal are often proprietary and poorly documented. Many traversal techniques require assistance from servers outside of the masqueraded network. Some methods use the server only when establishing the connection, while others are based on relaying all data through it, which increases the bandwidth requirements and latency, detrimental to real-time voice and video communications.\n\nNAT traversal techniques usually bypass enterprise security policies. Enterprise security experts prefer techniques that explicitly cooperate with NAT and firewalls, allowing NAT traversal while still enabling marshalling at the NAT to enforce enterprise security policies. IETF standards based on this security model are Realm-Specific IP (RSIP) and middlebox communications (MIDCOM).\n\nThe following NAT traversal techniques are available:\n\nThe recent proliferation of symmetric NATs has reduced NAT traversal success rates in many practical situations, such as for mobile and public WiFi connections. Hole punching techniques, such as STUN and ICE, fail in traversing symmetric NATs without the help of a relay server, as is practiced in TURN. Techniques that traverse symmetric NATs by attempting to predict the next port to be opened by each NAT device were discovered in 2003 by Yutaka Takeda at Panasonic Communications Research Laboratory and in 2008 by researchers at Waseda University. Port prediction techniques are only effective with NAT devices that use known deterministic algorithms for port selection. This predictable yet non-static port allocation scheme is uncommon in large scale NATs such as those used in 4G LTE networks and therefore port prediction is largely ineffective on those mobile broadband networks.\n\nIPsec virtual private network clients use NAT traversal in order to have Encapsulating Security Payload packets traverse NAT. IPsec uses several protocols in its operation which must be enabled to traverse firewalls and network address translators:\n\nMany routers provide explicit features, often called IPsec Passthrough.\n\nIn Windows XP, NAT traversal is enabled by default, but in Windows XP with Service Pack 2 it has been disabled by default for the case when the VPN server is also behind a NAT device, because of a rare and controversial security issue. IPsec NAT-T patches are also available for Windows 2000, Windows NT and Windows 98.\n\nNAT traversal and IPsec may be used to enable opportunistic encryption of traffic between systems. NAT traversal allows systems behind NATs to request and establish secure connections on demand.\n\nHosted NAT traversal (HNT) is a set of mechanisms, including media relaying and latching, used by intermediaries. The IETF advises against using latching over the Internet and recommends ICE for security reasons.\n\n\n"}

The symbol's design consists of twelve radial \"sig\" runes, similar to the symbols employed by the SS in their logo. Whether the symbol had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult concept of the \"black sun\", and therefore also its name, developed from the influence of a 1991 German novel \"Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo\" ('The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') by the pseudonymous author Russell McCloud.\n\nIn 1933, Heinrich Himmler acquired Wewelsburg, a castle near Paderborn, Germany. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.\n\nAs a product of Himmler's remodeling, twelve dark-green radially overlaid \"sig\" runes, such as those employed in the logo of the SS, appear on the white marble floor of the structure's north tower, the \"Obergruppenführersaal\" or \"General's Hall\". The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative Merovingian disks (\"Zierscheibe\"). According to the historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke:\n\nThe name \"Black Sun\" came into wider use after the publication of a 1991 occult thriller novel \"Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo\" ('The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') by the pseudonymous author Russell McCloud which linked the Wewelsburg mosaic with the neo-Nazi concept of the \"Black Sun\", invented by former SS officer Wilhelm Landig as a substitute for the Nazi swastika and a symbol for a mystic energy source that was supposed to renew the Aryan race.\n\nThe Black Sun symbol is widely associated with neo-fascism and neo-Nazism. It is utilized by far-right neo-Nazis, neo-volkisch movements, and white nationalists. The symbol often appears on extremist flags, t-shirts, posters, websites and in extremist publications associated with such groups. Modern far-right groups often refer to the symbol as the \"sun wheel\" or \"Sonnenrad\".\n\nA number of far-right groups and individuals have utilised the symbol in their propaganda, including the Christchurch mosque shooter, Australian neo-Nazi group Antipodean Resistance, and Ukrainian far-right National Guard regiment Azov Battalion. The symbol was displayed by members of several extremist groups involved in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAlong with other symbols from the Nazi era such as the Wolfsangel, the \"sig\" rune, and the totenkopf, the black sun is employed by some adherents of Satanism. In his book \"Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture\", scholar Chris Mathews states that \"Of the numerous permutations of the Wolfsangle, Satanists adopt the form used by the SS and numerous fascist organizations. Likewise, the Totenkopf used in the nineteenth century by the Prussian military was markedly more cartoonish than the SS's Death Head version, which is the version Church of Satan members use. The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous. Though based on medieval German symbols, the Wewelsburg mosaic is a unique design commissioned specifically for Himmler, and its primary contemporary association is Nazi occultism, for which Nazi Satanic groups and esoteric neo-Nazis adopt it.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2304475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304475", "title": "Nahuan languages", "text": "Nahuan languages\n\nThe Nahuan or Aztecan languages are those languages of the Uto-Aztecan language family that have undergone a sound change, known as Whorf's law, that changed an original *t to before *a. Subsequently, some Nahuan languages have changed this to or back to , but it can still be seen that the language went through a stage. The best known Nahuan language is Nahuatl.\n\nSome authorities, such as the Mexican government, \"Ethnologue,\" and \"Glottolog,\" consider the varieties of modern Nahuatl to be distinct languages, because they are often mutually unintelligible and their speakers have distinct ethnic identities. As of 2008, the Mexican government recognizes thirty varieties that are spoken in Mexico as languages (see the list below).\n\nResearchers distinguish between several dialect areas that each have a number of shared features: One classification scheme distinguishes innovative central dialects, spoken around Mexico City, from conservative peripheral ones spoken north, south and east of the central area, while another scheme distinguishes a basic split between western and eastern dialects. Nahuan languages include not just varieties known as Nahuatl, but also Pipil and the extinct Pochutec language.\n\nThe differences among the varieties of Nahuatl are not trivial, and in many cases result in low or no mutual intelligibility: people who speak one variety cannot understand or be understood by those from another. Thus, by that criterion, they could be considered different languages. The ISO divisions referenced below respond to intelligibility more than to historical or reconstructional considerations. Like the higher-level groupings, they also are not self-evident and are subject to considerable controversy.\n\nNevertheless, the variants all are clearly related and more closely related to each other than to Pochutec, and they and Pochutec are more closely related to each other than to any other Uto-Aztecan languages (such as Cora or Huichol, Tepehuán and Tarahumara, Yaqui/Mayo, etc.)\n\nLittle work has been done in the way of the historical linguistics of Nahuatl proper or the Aztecan (nowadays often renamed Nahuan) branch of Uto-Aztecan.\n\nLyle Campbell and Ronald W. Langacker (1978), in a paper whose focus was the internal reconstruction of the vowels of Proto-Aztecan (or Proto-Nahuan), made two proposals of lasting impact regarding the internal classification of the Aztecan branch. They introduced the claim, which would quickly be received as proven beyond virtually any doubt, that the well known change of Proto-Uto-Aztecan */ta-/ to */t͡ɬa-/ was a development in Proto-Aztecan (Proto-Nahuan), not a later development in some dialects descended from Proto-Aztecan. Second, they adduced new arguments for dividing the branch in two subdivisions: Pochutec, whose sole member is the Pochutec language, which became extinct sometime in the 20th century, and General Aztec, which includes the Pipil language and all dialects spoken in Mexico which are clearly closely related to the extinct literary language, Classical Nahuatl. This binary division of Aztecan (Nahuan) was already the majority opinion among specialists, but Campbell and Langacker's new arguments were received as being compelling. Furthermore, in \"adopt[ing] the term 'General Aztec' \", they may in fact have been the ones to introduce this designation. Part of their reconstruction of the Proto-Aztecan vowels was disputed by Dakin (1983).\n\nThe most comprehensive study of the history of Nahuan languages is Una Canger's \"Five Studies inspired by Nahuatl verbs in -oa\" (Canger 1980), in which she explores the historical development of grammar of the verbs ending in \"-oa\" and \"-ia\". She shows that verbs in \"-oa\" and \"-ia\" are historically and grammatically distinct from verbs in \"-iya\" and \"-owa\", although they are not distinguished in pronunciation in any modern dialects. She shows the historical basis for the five verb classes, based on how they form the perfect tense-aspect, and she shows that all of the different forms of the perfect tense-aspect derives from a single \"-ki\" morpheme that has developed differently depending on the phonological shape of the verb to which it was suffixed. She also explains the historical development of the applicative suffix with the shape \"-lia\" and \"-lwia\" as coming from a single suffix of the shape \"-liwa\".\n\nIn 1984 Canger and Dakin published an article in which they showed that Proto-Nahuan \"*ɨ\" had become /e/ in some Nahuan dialects and /i/ in others, and they proposed that this split was among the oldest splits of the Nahuan group.\n\nDakin has proposed a historical internal classification of Nahuan, e.g., Dakin (2000). She asserts two groups of migrations in central Mexico and eventually southwards to Central America. The first produced Eastern dialects. Centuries later, the second group of migrations produced Western dialects. But many modern dialects are the result of blending between particular Eastern dialects and particular Western dialects.\n\nCampbell in his grammar of Pipil (1985) discussed the problem of classifying Pipil. Pipil is either a descendant of Nahuatl (in his estimation) or still to this day a variety of Nahuatl (in the estimation of for example Lastra de Suárez (1986) and Dakin (2001)).\n\nDakin (1982) is a book-length study (in Spanish) of the phonological evolution of Proto-Nahuatl. Dakin (1991) suggested that irregularities in the modern Nahuatl system of possessive prefixes might be due to the presence in Proto-Nahuan of distinct grammatical marking for two types of possession.\n\nIn the 1990s, two papers appeared addressing the old research problem of the \"saltillo\" in Nahuatl: a lost paper by Whorf (1993), and Manaster Ramer (1995).\n\nA Center-Periphery scheme was introduced by Canger in 1978, and supported by comparative historical data in 1980. Lastra de Suarez' (1986) dialect atlas that divided dialects into center and peripheral areas based on strictly synchronic evidence. The subsequent 1988 article by Canger adduced further historical evidence for this division.(Dakin 2003:261).\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, scholarship on Nahuan languages was limited almost entirely to the literary language that existed approximately 1540–1770 (which is now known as Classical Nahuatl, although the descriptor \"classical\" was never used until the 20th century). Since the 1930s, there have appeared several grammars of individual modern dialects (in either article or book form), in addition to articles of narrower scope.\n\nThe history of research into Nahuan dialect classification in the 20th century up to 1988 has been reviewed by Canger (1988). Before 1978, classification proposals had relied to a greater or lesser degree on the three way interdialectal sound correspondence /t͡ɬ ~ t ~ l/ (the lateral affricate /t͡ɬ/ of Classical Nahuatl and many other dialects corresponds to /t/ in some eastern and southern dialects and to /l/ in yet other dialects). Benjamin Lee Whorf (1937) had performed an analysis and concluded that /t͡ɬ/ was the \"reflex\" of Proto-Uto-Aztecan */t/ before /a/ (a conclusion which has been borne out). But in 1978 Campbell and Langacker made the novel proposal—which met with immediate universal acceptance—that this sound change had occurred back in Proto-Aztecan (the ancestor dialect of Pochutec and General Aztec) and that therefore the corresponding /t/ or /l/ in Nahuatl dialects were innovations.\n\nAs a geographical note: the northern part of the State of Puebla is universally recognized as having two subgroupings. The northern part of the State of Puebla is a long north to south lobe. In the middle of it from east-northeast to west-southwest runs the Sierra de Puebla (as Nahuanist linguists call it) or Sierra Norte de Puebla (as geographers call it). The \"Sierra de Puebla\" dialects are quite distinct from the \"northern Puebla\" dialects, which are spoken in northernmost Puebla State and very small parts of neighboring states.\n\nDakin (2003:261) gives the following classification of Nahuatl dialects (in which the word \"north\" has been replaced by \"northern\"), based on her earlier publications, e.g., Dakin (2000).\n\n\nMost specialists in Pipil (El Salvador) consider it to have diverged from Nahuatl to the point it should no longer be considered a variety of Nahuatl. Most specialists in Nahuan do not consider Pochutec to have ever been a variety of Nahuatl.\n\nCanger (1978; 1980) and Lastra de Suarez (1986) have made classification schemes based on data and methodology which each investigator has well documented. Canger proposed a single Central grouping and several Peripheral groupings. The Center grouping is hypothesized to have arisen during the Aztec Empire by diffusion of the defining feature (an innovative verb form) and other features from the prestigious dialect of the capital. The dialects which adopted it could be from multiple genetic divisions of General Aztec. As for the various Peripheral groupings, their identity as Peripheral is defined negatively, i.e., by their lack the grammatical feature which, it is proposed, defines the Central grouping. Canger recognized the possibility that centuries of population migrations and other grammatical feature diffusions may have combined to obscure the genetic relationships (the branching evolution) among the dialects of Nahuatl.\n\nSome of the isoglosses used by Canger to establish the Peripheral vs. Central dialectal dichotomy are these:\n\nLastra de Suárez in her Nahuatl dialect atlas (1986) affirmed the concept of the Center/Periphery geographic dichotomy, but amended Canger's assignment of some subgroupings to the Center or the Periphery. The three most important divergences are probably those involving Huastec dialects, Sierra de Zongolica dialects, and northwestern Guerrero dialects. Lastra classifies these as Peripheral, Central, and Central, respectively, while in each case Canger does the opposite.\n\nThe dialectal situation is very complex and most categorizations, including the one presented above, are, in the nature of things, controversial. Lastra wrote, \"The isoglosses rarely coincide. As a result, one can give greater or lesser importance to a feature and make the [dialectal] division that one judges appropriate/convenient\" (1986:189). And she warned: \"We insist that this classification is not [entirely] satisfactory\" (1986:190). Both researchers emphasized the need for more data in order for there to be advances in the field of Nahuatl dialectology. Since the 1970s, there has been an increase in research whose immediate aim is the production of grammars and dictionaries of individual dialects. But there is also a detailed study of dialect variation in the dialect subgroup sometimes known as the Zongolica (Andrés Hasler 1996). A. Hasler sums up the difficulty of classifying Zongolica thus (1996:164): \"Juan Hasler (1958:338) interprets the presence in the region of [a mix of] eastern dialect features and central dialect features as an indication of a substratum of eastern Nahuatl and a superstratum of central Nahuatl. Una Canger (1980:15–20) classifies the region as part of the eastern area, while Yolanda Lastra (1986:189–190) classifies it as part of the central area.\"\n\nAs already alluded to, the nucleus of the Central dialect territory is the Valley of Mexico. The extinct Classical Nahuatl, the enormously influential language spoken by the people of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, is one of the Central dialects. Lastra in her dialect atlas proposed three Peripheral groupings: eastern, western, and Huasteca. She included Pipil in Nahuatl, assigning it to the Eastern Periphery grouping. Lastra's classification of dialects of modern Nahuatl is as follows (many of the labels refer to Mexican states):\n\n\nThis list is taken from the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI)'s \"Catálogo de Lenguas Indígenas Nacionales\". The full document has variations on the names especially “autodenominaciones” (\"self designations\", the names these dialect communities use for their language), along with lists of towns where each variant is spoken.\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation: \"IJAL\" = International Journal of American Linguistics\n"}

An estimated 150,000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia at any given time. SCA is hereditary, progressive, degenerative, and often fatal. There is no known effective treatment or cure. SCA can affect anyone of any age. The disease is caused by either a recessive or dominant gene. In many cases people are not aware that they carry a relevant gene until they have children who begin to show signs of having the disorder.\n\nSpinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is one of a group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive incoordination of gait and is often associated with poor coordination of hands, speech, and eye movements. A review of different clinical features among SCA subtypes was recently published describing the frequency of non-cerebellar features, like parkinsonism, chorea, pyramidalism, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, among others. As with other forms of ataxia, SCA frequently results in atrophy of the cerebellum, loss of fine coordination of muscle movements leading to unsteady and clumsy motion, and other symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms of an ataxia vary with the specific type and with the individual patient. In many cases a person with ataxia retains full mental capacity but progressively loses physical control.\n\nThe hereditary ataxias are categorized by mode of inheritance and causative gene or chromosomal locus. The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner.\n\n\nA few SCAs remain unspecified and can not be precisely diagnosed, but in the last decade genetic testing has allowed precise identification of dozens of different SCAs and more tests are being added each year. In 2008, a genetic ataxia blood test developed to test for 12 types of SCA, Friedreich's ataxia, and several others. However, since not every SCA has been genetically identified some SCAs are still diagnosed by neurological examination, which may include a physical exam, family history, MRI scanning of the brain and spine, and spinal tap.\n\nMany SCAs below fall under the category of polyglutamine diseases, which are caused when a disease-associated protein (i.e., ataxin-1, ataxin-3, etc.) contains a large number of repeats of glutamine residues, termed a polyQ sequence or a \"CAG trinucleotide repeat\" disease for either the one-letter designation or codon for glutamine respectively. The threshold for symptoms in most forms of SCA is around 35, though for SCA3 it extends beyond 50. Most polyglutamine diseases are dominant due to the interactions of resulting polyQ tail.\n\nThe first ataxia gene was identified in 1993 and called \"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1\" (SCA1); later genes were called SCA2, SCA3, etc. Usually, the \"type\" number of \"SCA\" refers to the order in which the gene was found. At this time, there are at least 29 different gene mutations that have been found.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the many types of \"Spinocerebellar ataxia\".\n\nOthers include SCA18, SCA20, SCA21, SCA23, SCA26, SCA28, and SCA29.\n\nFour X-linked types have been described (, , , ), but only the first of these has so far been tied to a gene (SCAX1).\n\nThere is no cure for spinocerebellar ataxia, which is currently considered to be a progressive and irreversible disease, although not all types cause equally severe disability.\n\nIn general, treatments are directed towards alleviating symptoms, not the disease itself. Many patients with hereditary or idiopathic forms of ataxia have other symptoms in addition to ataxia. Medications or other therapies might be appropriate for some of these symptoms, which could include tremor, stiffness, depression, spasticity, and sleep disorders, among others. Both onset of initial symptoms and duration of disease are variable. If the disease is caused by a polyglutamine trinucleotide repeat CAG expansion, a longer expansion may lead to an earlier onset and a more radical progression of clinical symptoms. Typically, a person afflicted with this disease will eventually be unable to perform daily tasks (ADLs). However, rehabilitation therapists can help patients to maximize their ability of self-care and delay deterioration to certain extent. Researchers are exploring multiple avenues for a cure including RNAi and the use of Stem Cells and several other avenues.\n\nOn January 18, 2017 BioBlast Pharma announced completion of Phase 2a clinical trials of their medication, Trehalose, in the treatment of SCA3. BioBlast has received FDA Fast Track status and Orphan Drug status for their treatment. The information provided by BioBlast in their research indicates that they hope this treatment may prove efficacious in other SCA treatments that have similar pathology related to PolyA and PolyQ diseases.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Beverly Davidson has been working on a methodology using RNAi technology to find a potential cure for over 2 decades. Her research began in the mid-1990s and progressed to work with mouse models about a decade later and most recently has moved to a study with non-human primates. The results from her most recent research \"are supportive of clinical application of this gene therapy\". Dr. Davidson along with Dr. Pedro Gonzalez-Alegre are currently working to move this technique into a Phase 1 clinical trial.\n\nFinally, another gene transfer technology discovered in 2011 has also been shown by Dr. Davidson to hold great promise and offers yet another avenue to a potential future cure.\n\nN-Acetyl-Leucine is an orally administered, modified amino acid that is being developed as a novel treatment for multiple rare and common neurological disorders by IntraBio Inc (Oxford, United Kingdom).\n\nN-Acetyl-Leucine has been granted multiple orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of various genetic diseases, including Spinocerebellar Ataxias. N-Acetyl-Leucine has also been granted Orphan Drug Designations in the US and EU for the related inherited cerebellar ataxia Ataxia-Telangiectasia U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nPublished case series studies have demonstrated the effects of acute treatment with N-Acetyl-Leucine for the treatment of inherited cerebellar ataxias, including Spinocerebellar Ataxias. These studies further demonstrated that the treatment is well tolerated, with a good safety profile.\n\nA multinational clinical trial investigating N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment of a related inherited cerebellar ataxia, Ataxia-Telangiectasia, began in 2019.\n\nIntraBio is also conducting parallel clinical trials with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C and GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff Disease). Future opportunities to develop N-Acetyl-Leucine include Lewy Body Dementia,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Restless Leg Syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, and Migraine\n\nPhysical therapists can assist patients in maintaining their level of independence through therapeutic exercise programmes. One recent research report demonstrated a gain of 2 SARA points (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) from physical therapy. In general, physical therapy emphasises postural balance and gait training for ataxia patients. General conditioning such as range-of-motion exercises and muscle strengthening would also be included in therapeutic exercise programmes. Research showed that spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) patients with a mild stage of the disease gained significant improvement in static balance and neurological indices after six months of a physical therapy exercise training program. Occupational therapists may assist patients with incoordination or ataxia issues through the use of adaptive devices. Such devices may include a cane, crutches, walker, or wheelchair for those with impaired gait. Other devices are available to assist with writing, feeding, and self care if hand and arm coordination are impaired. A randomised clinical trial revealed that an intensive rehabilitation program with physical and occupational therapies for patients with degenerative cerebellar diseases can significantly improve functional gains in ataxia, gait, and activities of daily living. Some level of improvement was shown to be maintained 24 weeks post-treatment. Speech language pathologists may use both behavioral intervention strategies as well as augmentative and alternative communication devices to help patients with impaired speech.\n\n"}

The other way of writing the name of this kata (汪輯) means \"Wang's Series (or Form)\" and refers to the name of the diplomat Wang (1621 – 1689). Wang was the leader of a large ambassadorial mission from China sent by the Qing government in 1683 to the village of Tomari. A poet, calligrapher, diplomat, and martial artist in the Shaolin tradition of Fujian White Crane, he is often credited with teaching chu'an fa to the gentry of Tomari.\n\nThe Wanshū kata was either a creation of Wang's, or composed by his students and named in tribute to him. Regardless, many karate traditions include a kata bearing the name of Wanshū or a variant (Ansu, Anshu) which vary in schematics but carry certain distinctive similarities. One translation of the word \"Wanshū\" is \"dumping form,\" \"dragon boy dumping form\" (in Shuri-ryū), and \"Strong Arm Form\" for the dramatic grab-and-throw technique seen in most versions. Also Shimabuku Tatsuo is credited for being the dragon boy (though \"Tatsuo\" means \"dragon man\").\n\nThe two main versions are Matsumura-Wanshū and Itosu-Wanshū, Itosu most likely having learned it from his teacher, Gusukuma of Tomari. Wanshū, while still bearing this name in certain karate styles, was renamed \"Empi\" by Gichin Funakoshi for use in Shotokan. This kata is also practiced in various Korean styles such as Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do and depending on the organization is called Wangshū, Wang Shu, or Yun Bi in Korean. Due to its difficulty, this kata is often reserved for advanced students.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2304509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304509", "title": "Puberty Blues", "text": "Puberty Blues\n\nPuberty Blues is a 1981 Australian coming-of-age film directed by Bruce Beresford. The film is based on the 1979 novel \"Puberty Blues\", by Gabrielle Carey and Kathy Lette, which is a protofeminist teen novel about two 13-year-old girls from the lower middle class Sutherland Shire in Sydney. The girls attempt to create a popular social status by ingratiating themselves with the \"Greenhill gang\" of surfers, who have a careless attitude toward casual sex, drugs and alcohol over the course of one Sydney summer.\n\nFor censorship reasons, in the film their age was increased to 16. Much of the content of the novel appears in the film, with several passages of text recounted by the film's protagonist Debbie (Nell Schofield) in a voice-over narration. The film closely follows the story and character trajectory of the novel. Some of the novel's characters are composites in the film. The tone of the novel is generally darker than that of the film, and in the novel Debbie and her best friend Sue, who join the surfer gang, are shown to be much more willing participants in activities than they are in the film. Some of the darker moments of the book have been removed or softened for the film. The film adds a comedy beach brawl between the surfers and the lifeguards not present in the novel.\n\nLette complained that \"the film sanitised the plot by omitting central references to miscarriage and abortion. The movie depicts a culture in which gang rape is incidental, mindless violence is amusing and hard drug use is fatal, but it was unable to address the consequences of the brutal sexual economy in which the girls must exist.\"\n\nMuch of the obscure surfer slang of the novel was omitted from the film. The novel features some discussion about television series \"Number 96\". One passage of the novel that mentions the title is recounted by the film's protagonist in a voice-over narration, but because the series had ended by the time of the 1981 film the series title is replaced by the generic term \"television\".\n\nTelevision writer Margaret Kelly was working at a writing workshop at a suburban theatre where she met Kathy Lette and Gabrielle Carey, who had written a number of unpublished stories about growing up in the surfing beaches of southern Sydney. Kelly showed the stories to producer and writer Joan Long, and optioned the film rights. Carey and Lette went on to write a column in \"The Sun-Herald\" as The Salami Sisters and the stories were published under the title \"Puberty Blues\".\n\nLong first approached Gillian Armstrong to direct but she turned it down. Then Bruce Beresford read the book and wrote asking to direct:\nI bought it [the novel] while I was waiting for a bus in North Sydney. I went to get a chocolate or something and I saw a pile of these things sitting on the counter. I thought I'd buy one and read it on the bus going home. It was remarkable, a very well-expressed book. And the girls were only fifteen. It was a sort of insight into the way of life of those kids, which was a revelation to me... Kathy Lette was a real livewire and so was the other girl, Gabrielle Carey.\nThe lead roles were cast after an extensive selection process. Lead actor in the film, Nell Schofield, said that \"It's a very honest and realistic movie. It touches on this and it touches on that. I really like it. It's subtle and doesn't preach: 'This is the way of life.'\" Schofield felt that \"Different sections of the audience will perceive different levels. The parents who go and see it will come out and either believe it or it will give them a bit of a jolt. They'll start looking at their kids a different way and try to bridge the generation gap.\" She added that \"The film is feminist in a way. I think it is also a comment on peer group pressure, male chauvinism in teenage groups, school and parent hassles.\"\n\nSchofield found the surfing scenes easy because she was an avid surfer in real life. \"Like Debbie, I wanted to be a surfie chick. But once I was, I wanted out before it got too heavy. I hated the alcohol and the drug scene. I saw so many kids fall down on the ground after taking drugs.\" Of making the film Schofield said \"We didn't expect any glitter, and we didn't get any. It was hard work.\"\n\nThe movie was made with the assistance of the Australian Film Commission, who provided $413,708.\n\nThe theme song \"Puberty Blues\" was written by Tim Finn. In the film it was sung by Sharon O'Neill. It was released by Jenny Morris as a single on Mushroom Records in December 1981.\n\n\"Puberty Blues\" grossed $3,918,000 at the box office in Australia.\n\n\"Puberty Blues\" was first released on home video in the early 1980s. It made its debut on DVD with a new print by Umbrella Entertainment in 2003. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the trailer, interviews with Nell Schofield and Bruce Beresford, trivia and biographies.\n\nIn 2013 Umbrella Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the northern part of the province of Huesca, part of the autonomous community of Aragon in Spain. Many of its people speak the Aragonese language locally known as \"fabla\".\n\nThe administrative capital is Boltaña and the economic development capital is Aínsa.\n\nSobrarbe was one of the Christian principalities of the Marca Hispanica, with obscure origins. Legend says there was a Kingdom of Sobrarbe, where a cross appeared upon a tree . \n\nIt became part of the County of Aragon, but in the early 9th century was held for five years by Amrus ibn Yusuf, the governor of Zaragoza, being retaken after his death. Sobrarbe was joined to the County of Ribagorza in the early 10th century through the marriage of Bernard I of Ribagorza to Toda Galíndez of Aragon, daughter of Galindo Aznárez II. However, in the late 10th and early 11th century, a series of incursions from the south left it disorganized and depopulated, and for a time it again fell under Muslim control. This was reversed by Sancho the Great of Pamplona, who reconquered the region in 1015, similarly extending his power into Ribagorza over the subsequent years. Whatever hereditary claim might have existed was subsequently brought to Sancho through his wife Muniadona of Castile, heiress to the Ribagorza counts.\n\nSancho divided the territories he had united, and his third son, Gonzalo, was given the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. After the death of Gonzalo in 1038, his illegitimate half-brother Ramiro I of Aragon brought Sobrarbe and Ribagorza into his hands, creating the nucleus of the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nThe entire territory of Sobrarbe is \"Sobrarbe Geopark\" which is a member of the European Geoparks Network (2004-) and Global Geoparks Network (2006-) on account of its outstanding geological heritage, educational programs and projects, and promotion of geotourism.\n\nAbizanda, Aínsa-Sobrarbe, Bárcabo, Bielsa, Boltaña, Broto, Fanlo, Fiscal, La Fueva, Gistaín, Labuerda, Laspuña, Palo, Plan, Puértolas, El Pueyo de Araguás, San Juan de Plan, Tella-Sin, Torla\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2304543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304543", "title": "Association of Chief Police Officers", "text": "Association of Chief Police Officers\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO) was a not-for-profit private limited company that for many years led the development of policing practices in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Established in 1948, ACPO provided a forum for chief police officers to share ideas and coordinate their strategic operational responses, and advised government in matters such as terrorist attacks and civil emergencies. ACPO coordinated national police operations, major investigations, cross-border policing, and joint law enforcement. ACPO designated Senior Investigative Officers for major investigations and appointed officers to head ACPO units specialising in various areas of policing and crime reduction.\n\nACPO was led by Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde, QPM, who was, until 2009, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He was elected as president by fellow members of ACPO in April 2009.\n\nACPO was funded by Home Office grants, profits from commercial activities and contributions from the 44 police authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nFollowing the Parker Review into ACPO, it was replaced in 2015 by a new body, the National Police Chiefs' Council, set up under a police collaboration agreement under Section 22A of the Police Act 1996.\n\nUK policing sprang from local communities in the 1800s. Since the origins of policing, chief officers have regularly associated to discuss and share policing issues. Although ACPO as now recognised was formed in 1948, records of prior bodies go back to the early 1900s. The UK retains a decentralised model of policing based around the settlement which emerged from the Royal Commission on the work of the Police in 1962.\n\nACPO continued to provide a forum for chief officers across 44 local police forces and 13 national areas across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and provided local forces with agreed national policies and guidelines. Originally more of a gentleman's club, it soon evolved into an effective body for representing senior ranks in the police service.\n\nACPO failed to convince its sponsors to contribute to its survival and in May 2011 the BBC reported that ACPO would run out of money in February 2012 without extra funding. ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 police authorities. A third of police authorities refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The Association of Police Authorities said the withdrawal of funding by police authorities was \"partly due to a squeeze on their income\". ACPO was due to wind up formally in April 2015.\n\nOver time, demands for coordination across the police service increased as society changed, for example to take account of new developments in international terrorism and organised crime, or roles such as monitoring offenders on release from prison or working with young people to divert them from crime.\n\nIn 1997 ACPO was incorporated as a private company limited by guarantee. As a private company, ACPO was not subject to freedom of information legislation. It was not a staff association; the staff association for senior police officers was a separate body, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA).\n\nThe change in structure from a \"band of volunteers\" to a limited company allowed the organisation to employ staff, enter into contracts for accommodation and publish accounts.\n\nA number of options were considered for the status of ACPO, including charitable status, but all were discounted.\n\nChief Constables and Commissioners are responsible for the direction and control of policing in their force areas. Although a national body and recognized by the government for consultation, ACPO had no powers of its own, nor any mandate to instruct chief officers. However, the organisation allowed chief officers to form a national policy rather than replicate the work in each of their forces. For example, after the 1980–81 riots in 27 British cities including in St. Pauls and Brixton ACPO began to prepare the Public Order Manual of Tactical Operations and Related Matters. Police forces began training in its tactics late in 1983.\n\nACPO was not a staff association. It acted for the police service, not its members. The separate Chief Police Officers Staff Association acts for chief officers.\n\nACPO was composed of the chief police officers of the 44 police forces in England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the Deputy Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constable of 42 of those forces and the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Assistant Commissioner and Commanders of the remaining two - the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. Certain senior non-police staff and senior members of national police agencies and certain other specialised and non-geographical forces in the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were also members.\n\nAs of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO. The membership elected a full-time President, who held the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002.\n\nACPO was responsible for several ancillary bodies, which it either funded or which received Home Office funding but which reported to ACPO:\n\nThe ACPO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) was set up in 2006 in response to a perceived gap in the police service's ability to manage criminal records and in particular to improve links to biometric data. The initial aim of ACRO was to provide operational support relating to criminal records and associated biometric data, including DNA and fingerprint recognition.\n\nIt also issues police certificates, for a fee, needed to obtain immigration visas for countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.\n\nThe organization continues under the style \"ACRO Criminal Records Office\" under the control of Hampshire Constabulary.\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), later the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NAVCIS), was managed by ACPO, and was responsible for combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime.\n\nThe National Community Tension Team (NCTT) was an ACPO body which monitored religious, racial, or other tensions within communities, and provided liaison between police forces and community organisations.\n\nThe National Counter Terrorism Security Office was funded by, and reported to, ACPO and advised the British government on its counter terrorism strategy.\n\nACPO was responsible for coordinating the national mobilisation of police resources at times of national need through the Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre (PNICC), which it set up in 2003. This included ensuring policing resilience during major events such as emergency response to serious flooding or the investigation of a terrorist attack. PNICC sat alongside the government in COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room) to advise on national issues. PNICC also handled support to overseas crises involving UK nationals.\n\nIt employed three full-time staff, with other staff seconded to it as needed and is funded by contributions from each of the police forces.\n\nThe Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) was set up in 2010 by ACPO (and run by the Metropolitan Police) to remove unlawful terrorist material content from the Internet with a focus on UK based material.\n\nThe December 2013 report of the Prime Minister's Extremism task force said that it would \"work with internet companies to restrict access to terrorist material online which is hosted overseas but illegal under UK law\" and \"work with the internet industry to help them in their continuing efforts to identify extremist content to include in family-friendly filters\" which would likely involve lobbying ISPs to add the CTIRU list to their filters without the need for additional legislation.\n\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit is a national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies.\n\nACPO had been criticised as being unaccountable to Parliament or the public by virtue of its limited company status. In October 2009 Sir Hugh Orde stated that ACPO would be \"more than happy\" to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On 30 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice announced that ACPO would be included under the FOI Act from October 2011. In its response, the organisation stated that \"Although organisations cannot voluntarily comply with the Act, a large proportion of ACPO's work is public already or available under FOI through any police force\". In January 2011 its website still said it: \"is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act. The organisation is too small and there are too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and to compile the responses\". From November 2011, however, FOI requests could be made to ACPO.\n\nIn February 2009, the \"Mail on Sunday\" highlighted the involvement of ACPO in setting up the \"Confidential Intelligence Unit\" as a specialised unit to monitor left-wing and right-wing political groups throughout the UK.\n\nThe February 2009 \"Mail on Sunday\" investigation also highlighted other activities of the ACPO including selling information from the Police National Computer for £70 despite it costing them only 60p to access it, marketing \"police approval\" logos to firms selling anti-theft devices and operating a separate private firm offering training to speed camera operators.\n\nThe organisation was criticised in February 2010 for allegedly spending £1.6 million per year from government anti-terrorist funding grants on renting up to 80 apartments in the centre of London which were reported as being empty most of the time. The organisation responded that it had reviewed this policy and would reduce the number of apartments.\n\nAs a result of \"The Guardian\" articles with regards to the activities and accusations of PC Mark Kennedy of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit within the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit, and the collapse of the subsequent trial of six activists, a number of initiatives and changes were announced:\n\nACPO has supervised the creation of one of the world's largest per-capita DNA databases, containing the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people. ACPO's guidelines that these profiles should only be deleted in \"exceptional circumstances\" were found to be unlawful by the UK Supreme Court in May 2011. They were found to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, following the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in \"S and Marper v United Kingdom\". On 1 May 2012, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 completed its passage through Parliament and received Royal Assent. To date, ACPO has not reissued revised guidelines to replace its unlawful DNA exceptional procedure. Big Brother Watch, in a report of June 2012, concludes that despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in England and Wales remains an uncertain and illiberal regime.\n\nDuring the summer of 2011, Hugh Orde, then president of the ACPO, was seen wearing a dark blue police-style uniform with ACPO insignia, and was accused of wearing a fake uniform. Senior police officers claimed that the uniform was not that of any police force in the country but \"closely resembled\" the uniform worn by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Paul Stephenson. Sam Leith, an author, journalist and literary editor of \"The Spectator\", mocked Orde's decision \"to wear this Gadaffi-style pretend uniform on television\", and suggested it was \"a subliminal pitch for the Met Commissioner's job.\" Brian Paddick, at the time the Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, said: \"It's unusual for the president of ACPO to appear in all these interviews in uniform. He is sending a clear signal: how would I look in the commissioner's uniform?\" One officer noted: \"If anything, Hugh should be wearing the uniform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland because that's where he served. But their uniform is green, not the dark blue he currently wears.\" An ACPO spokesperson stated that the \"Police Reform Act 2002 states that the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers holds the rank of chief constable. Not being a member of a particular force, the President wears a generic police uniform\".\n\nIn 2013, an independent review of ACPO by General Sir Nick Parker was published. It recommended that ACPO be replaced by a new body, in the interests of greater transparency and cost effectiveness. On the basis of these recommendations, a new organization, the National Police Chiefs' Council, was set up to replace ACPO, which it did on 1 April 2015.\n\n\n"}

It is mostly a farming community focused on crops and sheep, and holds the world record of 'the most dogs in a ute'.\n\nThe name \"Corrigin\", of Noongar indigenous origin, was first recorded in 1877 relating to a well in the area. The meaning of the name is unknown.\n\nBefore 1908 Corrigin's only connection with the rest of the state was the railway track that ran to Merredin and it was difficult to get anyone to take up land near the rabbit proof fence. Most of the land as once held by George Walton on a pastoral lease which he ran from his homestead at Wogerlin rock. The first settlers to the area were Mr A. W. Goyder (the son of the South Australian Surveyor General), who took up the area on which the town now stands. He was followed by Jack Crossland then by Messrs Gayfer and Jose Bros.\n\nIn 1909, the Government planned to build a railway from Brookton on the Great Southern Railway to the town of Kunjin, 17 km west of Corrigin. Some time after, a line from Wickepin was also proposed, and the Government decided to locate the crossing point at Corrigin.\n\nA storm swept through the area in 1913 lashing the area with hailstones over in diameter. The town was also deluged with over of rain in a few hours. Standing crops were flattened, fences in low-lying areas were washed away and most of the town was submerged under at least of water.\n\nIn 1913, a railway siding was built, and named \"Dondakin\" by railway authorities due to conflict with the name elsewhere. However, after much local protest, the siding was renamed Corrigin and gazetted on 15 May 1914. The railway line from Wickepin, Western Australia opened a month later, and the main office of the local Road Board moved to the town. In 1915, a school was built.\n\nIn 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The bulk handling facility had been installed by November the following year and the first trial load of wheat was satisfactorily loaded.\n\nBy 1937 the town boasted a hall that cost £8,000 to build, a large state hotel, commercial buildings, bowling green, tennis course, golf course and one of the best showgrounds in the state. The town still had no adequate water scheme, there was no lack of well water but the water drawn was very hard.\n\nThe wheatbelt was struck by drought for much of 1939 and nearly all of 1940, described at the time as \"the worst in the states history\" until heavy rains arrived in December of that year. Corrigin received of drought-breaking rain over a couple of days.\n\nThe town was lashed by a violent storm on New Year's Day in 2013. Destructive winds and of rain tore through over the course of an hour leaving behind fallen powerlines, uprooted trees, sheds torn apart and roofs ripped from homes.\n\nCorrigin has a population of 903 and is a key agricultural centre for a district focussed mainly on wheat and sheep farming. It is the location of a CBH management zone office, and in 1973 was the location of a 'type B' wheat bin.\n\nIt contains a district high school (originally opened 1915 as a primary school), National Australia bank, shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, motel, caravan park), council offices and a telecentre. Each year, it hosts an agricultural show.\n\nThe town is a stop on the Transwa bus service to Esperance via Kulin/Hyden.\n\nA large rocky outcrop just to the east of town is Corrigin Rock.\n\nAbout 5 km west of town is the Corrigin dog cemetery, containing over 80 buried dogs.\n\n"}

Graves (born 30 June 1963) is an English film, television, and theatre actor. He is known for his roles in \"A Room with a View\", \"Maurice\", \"The Madness of King George\" and \"The Forsyte Saga\". Since 2010 he has starred as DI Lestrade in the BBC television series \"Sherlock\".\n\nGraves was born in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England, to Mary Lousilla (\"née\" Roberts) Graves, a travel coordinator, and Richard Harding Graves, a music teacher and musician.\n\nGraves was educated at Wyvern Community School, a state comprehensive school in his home town of Weston-super-Mare, which he left at the age of 15. The school has since closed and re-opened as the Hans Price Academy.\n\nGraves's first job after leaving school was as a circus clown. He has appeared in more than 25 films and more than 35 television productions. He has also appeared on stage.\n\nGraves first came to prominence in costume-drama adaptations of E. M. Forster's novels \"A Room with a View\" (1985) and \"Maurice\" (1987), before going on to appear in films including \"A Handful of Dust\" (1988), the Oscar nominated \"The Madness of King George\" (1994), \"Different for Girls\" (1996), and \"Intimate Relations\" (1996).\n\nGraves's role in \"Intimate Relations\" won him the Best Actor award at the 1996 Montreal World Film Festival. He was also acclaimed for his portrayal of Young Jolyon Forsyte in the television miniseries \"The Forsyte Saga\" (2002).\n\nIn 1987 in his hometown of Weston-super-Mare, Graves met Yvonne, a stained glass artist (later a trained gardener), in a café. They lived together in Stoke Newington, and he helped her raise her two daughters, who were 10 and 14 years old when the relationship began. Graves and Yvonne were together for 13 years.\n\nIn September 2000, shortly after Graves's relationship with Yvonne ended, he met Australian-born production coordinator Suzanne Lewis at the opening-night party for \"The Caretaker\", a play he was appearing in at the time with Michael Gambon. They married, and have five children together.\n\nIn addition to his screen work, Graves has also won acclaim for his stage acting, including roles on the American stage in Broadway-theatre productions in New York City, New York, of the plays \"Closer\" (2000) and \"The Elephant Man\" (2002).\n\nGraves's notable London theatre credits includes his performance as Presley Stray in the original production of Philip Ridley's \"The Pitchfork Disney\" (1991) at the Bush Theatre, west London, which won him Best Actor at the 1991 Charrington London Fringe Awards; Martin Sherman's \"A Madhouse in Goa\" (1989) opposite Vanessa Redgrave; and as Eddie in the Peter Hall Company's production of David Rabe's \"Hurlyburly\" (1997-8) at the Old Vic and Queen's Theatre, for which he was nominated for the 1998 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.\n\n"}

Most commonly, Galindians refers to the Western Galindians who lived in the southeast part of Prussia. Less commonly, it is used for a tribe that lived in the area of what is today Moscow.\n\nThe name \"Galinda\" is thought to derive from the Baltic word *\"galas\" (\"the end\"), alluding to the fact that they settled for some time further west and further east than any other Baltic tribe.\n\nThe Western Galindians (Old Prussian: *\"Galindis\", Latin: \"Galindae\") – at first a West Baltic tribe, and later an Old Prussian clan – lived in Galindia, roughly the area of present-day Masuria but including territory further south in what would become the Duchy of Masovia. The region lay adjacent to the territory of the Yotvingians, which is today in Podlaskie Voivodeship.\n\nThe name \"Galind\"- is probably derived from the hydronym of \"Gielądzkie Jezioro\" (53° 52' N, 21° 10' E) in the province of Olsztyn, in what was the very center of ancient \"Galindia\". J. Nalepa (1971) suggested the root *\"gal\"- was originally a different ablaut grade of the same root found in Lith. \"\"gilus\"\" – deep, and \"\"gelmė\"\" – depth. The original meaning referred to the depth of the lake mentioned, which is one of the deepest in the area.\n\nPtolemy was the first to mention the Galindians (Koine Greek: \"Galindoi\" – Γαλίνδοι) in the 2nd century AD. From the 6th/7th century until the 17th century the former central part of the Galindian tribe continued to exist as the Old Prussian clan of *Galindis. The language of the Old Prussians in Galindia became extinct by 17th century, mainly because of the 16th centuries influx of Protestants seeking refuge from Catholic Poland into Galindian area and German-language administration of Prussia.\n\nThe Eastern Galindians (East Galindian: *\"Galindai\", Russian: \"Goliadj\", \"голядь\", from Old East Slavic *\"Golędĭ\"), an extinct East Baltic tribe, lived from the 4th century in the basin of the Protva River, near the modern Russian towns of Mozhaysk, Vereya, and Borovsk. It is probable that the Eastern Galindians, as the bearers of the Moshchiny culture, also occupied all the Kaluga Oblast before the Early East Slavs peopled the Moshchiny culture's area at the turn of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\nThe Russian chronicles first mention Eastern Galindians as \"Goliadj\" in 1058. Prince Yury Dolgorukiy arranged a campaign against them in 1147, the year of the first mention of Moscow in the Russian chronicles. Subsequent chronicles do not mention the Eastern Galindians. Nevertheless, the Russians probably did not completely assimilate them until the 15th (or 16th) century.\n\nIn modern Moscow there is Golyadski lane.\n\nSome people still identified as Goliads in the 19th century.\n\n"}

{"id": "2304605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304605", "title": "George Edalji", "text": "George Edalji\n\nGeorge Ernest Thompson Edalji (22 January 1876 – 17 June 1953) was an English solicitor and son of a vicar of Parsi descent in a South Staffordshire village. He became known as a victim of a miscarriage of justice for having served three years' hard labour after being convicted on a charge of injuring a pony. He was initially regarded having been responsible for the series of animal mutilations known as the 'Great Wyrley Outrages', but the prosecution case against him became regarded as weak and prejudiced. He was pardoned on the grounds of the conviction being an unsafe one after a campaign in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle took a prominent role. The difficulty in overturning the conviction of Edalji was cited as showing that a better mechanism was needed for reviewing unsafe verdicts, and it was a factor in the 1907 creation of the Court of Criminal Appeal for England. Despite an official inquiry's finding that Edalji was the author of poison pen letters associated with the mutilations, he was allowed to resume practice as a solicitor and lived quietly with a sibling until his death.\n\nEdalji was the eldest of the three children. His mother was Charlotte Edalji (\"née\" Stoneham), the daughter of a Shropshire vicar. His father was the Reverend Shapurji Edalji, a convert from a Bombay Parsi family. He had served as the curate in several parishes before being given the living as vicar of St. Mark's, Great Wyrley. The right to make this appointment lay with the bishop, and the Reverend Edalji obtained the position through the previous incumbent, his wife's uncle, who arranged it as a wedding present. Livings were much sought after because they were scarce and conferred valuable emoluments.\n\nThe Reverend Edalji moved into the vicarage in late 1875, it was a large house with its own grounds; George, the first child, was born there soon after. The Reverend Edalji was more assertive than his predecessor and was sometimes involved in controversy about parish business. Many modern writers on the case express the opinion that rural English society was infected with backward racialist attitudes, and that this would have been particularly true of a village like Great Wyrley which may well have had the first South Asian to become the incumbent of an English parish.. An aristocratic former army officer named Captain the Honourable G.A. Anson was the Chief Constable of Staffordshire during the case. He is widely seen as having expressed a racist attitude toward the Edaljis.\n\nAnonymous threatening letters were sent to the vicarage in 1888, when George Edalji was twelve and a half, demanding that the Reverend order a particular newspaper and threatening to break windows if this was not done. He ignored them. Windows were broken and a threat was made to shoot the Reverend; he became alarmed and called in the police. Graffiti was written slandering the Edaljis on the inside and outside walls of the vicarage. Pseudonymous letters were sent to the vicarage maid-of-all-work, 17-year-old Elizabeth Foster, threatening to shoot her when her \"Black master\" was out. One was found inside the hall with the envelope wet; the letter was written on pages from the exercise books of the Edalji children.\n\nThe circumstances made it clear that either Foster or Edalji was responsible. Foster was implicated by assertions made by Edalji; the Reverend, his wife, and police Sergeant Upton thought that they perceived similarities between Foster's handwriting and that of the pseudonymous threatening letters. The Reverend prosecuted Foster for writing the letters, which she denied doing. He offered to drop the case if Foster confessed, but she refused and went to live with an aunt. Foster, unable to pay for a defence at trial, pleaded guilty in front of the magistrates in exchange for being given probation, but continued maintaining her innocence thereafter. The Reverend congratulated Upton for his performance.\n\nIn 1892, a member of the parish council named W.H. Brookes received obscene letters that included accounts of his adult daughter sexually abusing her 10 year-old sister. The letters mentioned Edalji among others at first, but increasingly concentrated on Edalji and the Reverend, sometimes using a phrase (\"the blackman\") that had occurred in 1888 letters attributed to Elizabeth Foster. One letter was made in two distinctly different handwritings. The letters to Brookes accused his son of writing the 1888 letters to the vicarage which had been attributed to Elizabeth Foster, and of giving them to George Edalji to post. Reverend Edalji and a vicarage servant also got letters, in which the Reverend was accused of \"gross immorality with persons using Vaseline in the same way as did Oscar Wilde\". Letters purporting to be from the Reverend Edalji were sent to other vicars. Brookes and Reverend Edalji called in the police, and Sergeant Upton again found himself investigating poison pen letters to the vicar. Attempts to get the post office to identify the sender failed as the mailed letters ceased. Notes began appearing at the vicarage (a total of over 70), and various objects were left on the doorstep, including a bag of excrement. Police kept watch and claimed to have established that the key, stolen from Walsall Grammar School six miles away (where George Edalji was a student) that had appeared on the doorstep had done so in a time frame when only George Edalji had used the entrance. Following this, excrement was smeared on the outside of upstairs windows, and Upton decided that George had been responsible for the letters. It was about this time that The Rev Edalji began sharing a bedroom with George; the arrangement continued for the next 17 years.\n\nA police ploy, which was clearly aimed at getting Edalji to incriminate himself as the note writer, brought forth protests from his mother at the way the investigation was focusing on him. She and her husband demanded that Foster be arrested. A campaign of hoax ordering of goods and services for the vicarage lasted for 3 years. Police largely ceased investigating the incidents. In response to her protests, Chief Constable of the county Captain Anson told Mrs. Edalji that she should make a serious effort to help catch the culprit if she wanted his men to spend more time on the matter, as it was obviously either her husband or son. Reverend Edalji threatened to complain to higher authority about the conduct of Anson. The notes and hoaxes ceased in December 1895.\n\nBrookes came to believe that Edalji was the author of the 1892 poison pen letters. He said that Edalji had smiled at him in the railway station, to which Brookes had responded with a disagreeable look, thereafter, Brookes asserted, the letters began to refer to him as \"sour face\". Brookes also said that the letters to him stopped after he had swung punches at Edalji on the platform. Edalji was hired at a legal firm as a trainee solicitor and scored exceptionally high marks in his professional examinations but was not taken on as a newly qualified solicitor. In 1899, his family helped him set up on his own, working out of an office in Birmingham and sometimes from the vicarage. He was described as looking younger than his age, of a rather peculiar appearance, and solitary, being given to taking evening strolls by himself. A couple of roughs were fined for hitting him while he was on one of his evening walks three miles from his house one night in 1900; the assailants were not from Great Wyrley or known to Edalji. His book \"Railway Law for the ‘Man in the train’\" was published in 1901. A solicitor, clerk to the court and friend on Anston, C.A. Loxton, was later to accuse Edalji of writing \"immoral and offensive\" allegations on walls about Loxton and his fiancée. Most present-day commenters on the case take the view that the traditional culture in a Staffordshire village of the time would make George Edalji an object of suspicion because of his racial heritage, but he appears to have had attracted favourable comment for his book, and had been trusted enough to have clients among local small businessmen.\n\nAs a result of having agreed to stand surety for a fellow solicitor (who then absconded), Edalji became being liable for a debt of nine thousand pounds. In December 1902 his creditors threatened him with bankruptcy unless he paid a hundred of the amount immediately. Initially Edalji wrote begging letters, but he appears to have obtained the demanded payment, possibly by going to his parents.\n\nIn Jan 1903, when Edalji was 27 years old, a series of slashings occurred against horses and other livestock, known as the 'Great Wyrley Outrages'. A horse was maimed on 1 February 1903, two horses were similarly wounded on 29 June 1903, and a number of other animals received injuries resulting in their being put down. Isolated cases of livestock maiming were not unheard of as a way of settling scores in farming communities, but the series of attacks provoked a public outcry far beyond the area.\n\nPolice received pseudonymous letters purporting to be from one of a gang of culprits, and the letters named real people as members of the gang, including Edalji. Several others named in the letters were schoolboys whom Edalji regularly commuted with in the same train compartment. A letter was also sent to Edalji purporting to be from one of them, 15-year-old Wilfred Greatorex.\n\nStaffordshire Chief Constable Captain Anson was an administrator without experience of investigatory police work. He believed that Edalji was the author of the letters, but someone of his professional status could have had no involvement in the animal maimings. Inspector Campbell headed enquiries into the maimings and from an early stage considered Edalji a person of particular interest, although there were a number of suspects. The exact nature of circumstantial evidence that led to suspicion falling on Edalji is unknown, but according to what Anson privately alleged years later, Edalji had a reputation for roaming the area at night and, on two occasions, trails of footprints from attack locations seemed to lead to the vicarage. Most of the crimes had occurred within a half mile radius of the vicarage. On 29 June, two horses were mutilated. Following this, the seventh attack, Campbell felt sure that Edalji was responsible for the maimings because he reportedly had been seen late that evening in the field where it took place.\n\nInspector Campbell began to focus on Edalji for the mutilations. Then a July 1903 letter threateningly predicted that \"little girls\" would be the target of the next attacks. Anson agreed to a watch being kept on the vicarage and nearby countryside. There were rumours that Edalji was going to be arrested for the attacks, and he offered a reward for information about who was spreading them. His habit of taking walks continued, and he returned from one at around 9 pm on 17 August.\n\nEarly on 18 August, a wounded pony was discovered, half a mile from the scene of the first attack. Inspector Campbell sent a constable to the railway station where Edalji was waiting to catch his train, asking him to help with inquiries, but he declined and left for Birmingham. Inspector Campbell went to the vicarage with a sergeant and constable, and asked to see any weapons in the house; a small trowel was the only thing shown to them. Edalji's clothing was also asked for; it included muddy boots as well as mud-stained serge trousers and a housecoat—both of which the police said were damp. The inspector said that there was a hair on the housecoat, whereupon there was a dispute between the Inspector and the Reverend over whether something visible on the housecoat was a hair or a loose thread.\n\nThe next day, police searched the vicarage and found a case with four razors in the bedroom that Edalji shared with his father. Reverend Edalji said that the razors were old ones not in use. According to the police, they pointed out that one razor was wet; the Reverend took it and wiped the blade with his thumb; he later said that this was not true. Police said that a heel on the boots was worn down in an unusual way and left a distinctive pattern on the ground that matched heel impressions in an alleged trail of footprints between the vicarage and the scene of the crime. A local doctor who examined the housecoat for the police said that it was bloodstained, and there were 29 hairs on it similar to ones from the pony's hide near the wound. The doctor said that the hairs were small and difficult to see.\n\nHome Office officials later considered it highly unlikely that police would have gone on to fabricate evidence by planting the hairs after the Edaljis had vehemently drawn attention to the absence of hairs on the housecoat while it was handed over.The Rev Edalji protested that his son did not have the key to the locked door of the room in which they slept, but contemporaries did not consider the by then 27 years' old George sleeping in the same room as his father a normal arrangement.\n\nEdalji consistently maintained that he was innocent of all charges. He pleaded not guilty to injuring the pony; an indictment was not tried for sending a letter threatening to kill a policeman. The trial was moved out of the village, which meant that the jury was of people who did not know Edalji. The prosecution accused Edalji of having left the house and attacked the pony in the early hours of the morning. The Reverend said that he had hardly slept that night and knew that Edalji could not have left the bedroom which they shared, the door of which he had locked as usual. According to Richard Davenport-Hines, writing in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\".\n\nThe case arrayed against young Edalji was preposterous. As an astigmatic myopic he was incapable of complicated nocturnal excursions; the vicarage was surrounded on the night of 17 August by a cordon of men through which he could not have penetrated; apparently incriminating dirty razors found in a police search of the vicarage were stained with rust, not blood; putatively incriminating mud found on his clothes and boots did not come from the field where the horse was slaughtered; horse hairs which police claimed to have found on his coat were probably threads; his father’s sworn oath that they had slept the night in the same room behind a locked door was disregarded. After George Edalji was condemned to seven years’ penal servitude, his family was brutally baited.\n\nEdalji’s defence did not hire experts to testify about his poor eyesight, nor did Edalji himself mention it at trial, only subsequently was it to be the main grounds for his campaign to be recognised as innocent. He later said that he had been told by his lawyers that the prosecution case was so weak it was unnecessary to bring up how poor his vision was, but he also admitted that he could move about at night quite well as long as the road was a main one and familiar to him. The initial prosecution theory about the mutilations having taken place in the evening was contradicted by much evidence and the case against Edalji was weakened as a result. The police sergeant and inspector differed on whether there was no watch on the vicarage at all on the night or only one man, but they agreed there was no cordon, and the prosecution modified their allegations to assert the attack on the pony had come in the early hours of the morning. Edalji was convicted and sentenced to seven years hard labour. Some 10,000 signatures, including hundreds from lawyers, were on petitions that protested the conviction. Some legal figures thought that it was improper under English evidence law as it then was for Edalji to be sent for trial charged with separate offences of sending a threatening letter and a pony maiming, and then having evidence about letters used to help convict him of the maiming, which was the sole offence for which he was then being tried.\n\nR.D. Yelverton, former Chief Justice in the Bahamas, thought that the case for the prosecution had been conclusively disproved. He asked: “How could a gentleman in the position and of the education of Mr. Edalji, be supposed to write the following, put by the Prosecution before the Jury, as written by him. (They were sent either to the Police or to himself). ‘You great hulking blackguard and coward I have got you fixed you dirty Cad – bloody monkey!’”\n\nSenior civil servants at the Home Office reviewed the case and reported that there were no serious flaws in the trial and conviction of Edalji. He was paroled after serving three years.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, then second only to Rudyard Kipling as a celebrated British writer, became the most influential supporter of the public campaign for Edalji’s pardon. The weight that Conan Doyle’s opinion on the case carried with the public stemmed from the appeal of his fictional master detective Sherlock Holmes, which associated the author with Holmesian traits of close attention to detail and drawing logical inferences. \n\nConan Doyle arrived to meet with Edalji at a hotel after becoming interested in the case, and he recalled that he paused to study Edalji, who was passing the time reading a newspaper while waiting in the lobby. On observing how Edalji held the paper at an angle inches from his face, Conan Doyle was convinced that Edalji was innocent; he believed it impossible for someone with eyesight as bad as Edalji’s to have moved through the countryside after nightfall attacking animals and successfully evading the police.\n\nAnson corresponded with Conan Doyle and met with him in January 1907 to discuss the case, but relations became acrimonious between them two days later when Anson was informed by Conan Doyle that he intended to campaign for Edalji to be given a pardon. Anson thought that a firm conclusion could not have been reached from a neutral standpoint in that amount of time, and that Conan Doyle had obtained his co-operation and an interview by misrepresenting himself as having no settled opinion about the case. Conan Doyle wrote to the Home Office saying that Anson had implied homosexual incest between the Reverend and Edalji. Anson insisted that he did no such thing.\n\nThe same day that Conan Doyle wrote his letter of intent to Captain Anson, a long pseudonymous letter was sent to Conan Doyle, Edalji, and Anson with apparent inside knowledge of the arguments which Conan Doyle intended to publish, the first of a spate about the case that they received. It purported to be by a private detective who had been summoned to the vicarage; this was similar to an ingenious deception perpetrated during the hoax campaign of 1892, when a female private detective was led to believe that she was working for Mrs. Edalji to investigate suspected infidelity by the Reverend. It has been questioned whether the detailed knowledge of incidents at the vicarage and Edalji’s professional life that were demonstrated in the letter could have come from anyone not at the centre of those events or part of the investigation into them. Attribution of the letters is further complicated by police having used the ploy of sending pseudonymous letters to Edalji on a couple of occasions before his arrest.\n\nThe “private detective” letter of 1907 ostensibly offered to help Edalji, but seemed to be an obvious trap. It has been suggested that the letters were aimed at disrupting the campaign to have him granted a pardon. The police handwriting consultant said that the letter was by Edalji in his ‘Greatorex’ hand. Police believed that such letters had ceased while Edalji was in prison, and they attributed those pseudonymous or anonymous letters about the case received when Edalji was in gaol to persons other than the author of the 1903 pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters, which police believed was Edalji. Poison pen letters in the name of the “Wyrley Gang” continued until the 1930s, by an offender who also wrote to people connected to other crimes in the news. \n\nConan Doyle became an active investigator, going to the crime scenes, interviewing participants, and critiquing the reliability of the witness who testified that peculiarities found in the handwriting of Edalji also occurred in the 1903 pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters to police, which named Edalji as a culprit in the animal mutilations. Legal technicalities made the evidence controversial concerning the letters being used to convict Edalji, because he was not tried on the charge of sending a threatening letter. Opinion within the Home Office was split on the matter. Conan Doyle thought that he had identified the person as a certain Royden Sharp who was behind the pseudonymous letters of 1892 and 1903 and the maimings. There have been a variety of opinions since about whether he was justified in his belief, although Peter Costello wrote a modern book on Conan Doyle’s investigations and concurred with his conclusion.\n\nNewspapers suggested that visual impairment would have made it impossible for Edalji to have committed the crime. Captain Anson told the Home Office that he thought that Edalji was physically more than capable of the nocturnal maiming, asserting that Edalji had a panther-like gait and eyes that “came out with a strange sort of glow, like a cat’s eyes” in a low light. According to Anson's communications with the Home Office about the case, an assertion was “indisputably false” that Edalji made in a letter published in a newspaper to the effect that he was not abroad after nightfall. Anson said that several people remembered coming across Edalji very late at night and miles from his house during 1903.\n\nConan Doyle’s articles in support may have been a key factor in getting the authorities to commission a committee of inquiry. Edalji was granted a pardon for the maiming conviction in May 1907, though the inquiry found that he had brought prosecution upon himself by sending the pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters to police during the summer of 1903, which meant that he was not given compensation.\n\nEdalji’s case and the associated campaign were factors in the creation of England’s Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907. A June 1907 memo by Home secretary Herbert Gladstone was discovered 80 years later, which revealed that one of the lawyers who had represented Edalji had privately told Gladstone of suppressing a letter by Edalji, which his brother Horace had brought as a specimen of Edalji’s handwriting, because it was damaging to the defence’s case. It consisted of obscenities similar to ones that Edalji was accused of sending. When the 1907 letters started, the lawyer’s colleague remarked “He is at it again.”\n\nIn November 1907, Edalji was accepted back on to the roll of solicitors in good standing and allowed to practice, despite the Committee of Inquiry’s conclusion that he had written some of the 1903 letters. His sister Maud moved in with him, and they lived together in Welwyn Garden City until his death in 1953.

He was a founding member of the band Slapp Happy, worked with Henry Cow and has made a number of solo albums, including \"Flying Doesn't Help\" (1979) and \"World Service\" (1981). \n\nAs a lyricist, Moore has collaborated with Pink Floyd on two of their albums: \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" (1987) and \"The Division Bell\" (1994), and contributed music to the instrumental \"Calling\" from \"The Endless River\" (2014). He contributed lyrics to Richard Wright's \"Broken China\" (1996), worked with Kevin Ayers on various projects and also contributed lyrics to Trevor Rabin's \"Can't Look Away\" (1989) and Julian Lennon's \"Help Yourself\" (1991).\n\nAnthony Moore's musical career began when he met Peter Blegvad, while both were students at St Christopher School, Letchworth. They played in various bands, including Slapp Happy (the name was a reference to Blegvad's then-girlfriend) and the Dum-Dums. After school Moore studied Indian classical music with Viram Jasani in 1969, and went on to compose his first film soundtrack for David Larcher's \"Mare's Tale\".\n\nIn 1971 Moore moved to Hamburg, Germany and worked in Hamburg's experimental music scene, recording two minimalist albums for Polydor Germany. In 1972 Blegvad visited Moore in Hamburg and, along with Moore's girlfriend (and soon to be wife) Dagmar Krause, Moore (guitar, keyboards), Blegvad (guitar) and Krause (vocals) formed the avant-pop trio, Slapp Happy. Moore and Blegvad composed the band's music.\n\nSlapp Happy recorded two albums for Polydor Germany with krautrock group Faust as their backing band. Polydor released the first, \"Sort Of\" in 1972, but rejected the second, \"Casablanca Moon\". This rejection prompted Slapp Happy to relocate to London where they signed up with Virgin Records and re-recorded \"Casablanca Moon\", released in 1974 by Virgin as \"Slapp Happy\". (The original \"Casablanca Moon\" was later released by Recommended Records as \"Acnalbasac Noom\" in 1980.) In 1974 Slapp Happy merged briefly with avant-rock group Henry Cow, recording two albums in 1975, \"Desperate Straights\" and \"In Praise of Learning\". However soon after recording the second album, first Moore, then Blegvad left the amalgamation on account of incompatibilities with the group. Blegvad remarked that the \"chords and the time signatures were too complicated.\" But Krause elected to remain with Henry Cow and that spelt the end of Slapp Happy.\n\nMoore and Blegvad parted company at this point, but participated in brief Slapp Happy reunions in 1982, 1997, 2000 and 2016–2017. Moore, Blegvad and Krause also collaborated in 1991 on the specially commissioned opera 'Camera', which was made by the production company After Image and was broadcast two years later on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter leaving Henry Cow/Slapp Happy, Moore relaunched his solo career in 1977 by releasing \"Out\" on Virgin Records, with backing by Kevin Ayers and Andy Summers. \"Out\", however, was not commercial enough for Virgin, and they cancelled Moore's contract. In 1979 and 1981 Moore recorded \"Flying Doesn't Help\" and \"World Service\", respectively on independent labels. Both albums were well received. The song \"World Service\", inspired by the BBC World Service, was released as a single and combines shortwave radio with heavy dance beats.\n\nMoore has worked in various European locations as a freelance composer, writing songs and film scores. He produced a number of albums, including This Heat's debut album, \"Angel Station\" by Manfred Mann's Earth Band (in conjunction with Mann who later covered his song \"World Service\"). Moore also collaborated with Pink Floyd on three of their albums.\n\nIn 1996 Moore was appointed professor for research into sound and music in the context of new media at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany. From 2000 to 2004 he was the principal of the Academy of Media Arts. Moore has also travelled to many European locations, presenting lectures on sound and music.\n\nIn 2002 Moore formed a music trio with Jörg Lindenmaier and Peter C. Simon called LMS, named after the first letters of their surnames. They performed in France and Germany between 2002 and 2003.\n\nKrause, Moore and Blegvad reformed Slapp Happy in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on 10–11 February 2017 at Cafe Oto in London. On 24 February 2017 Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt. Rainer Hall, Shibuya in Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His ambitions made him a target for local bullies, and after one too many beatings, King began studying the martial arts, excelling at them from the start. His father, a TV sports producer, and his mother, a former professional dancer, were very supportive—as long as he completed his college education.\n\nHaving reached his goal in his late teens, King toured the world as part of a famous dance troupe, but his travels exposed him to a world full of famine, poverty, violence, prejudice and lack of faith. King tried to help these unfortunates on more than one occasion, nearly getting himself killed in the process.

The film was written by, directed by, and stars Albert Brooks. It also stars Meryl Streep, Rip Torn, Lee Grant, and Buck Henry.\n\nThe film was shot in and around Los Angeles, California. Despite its comedic overtones, \"Defending Your Life\" contains elements of drama and allegory.\n\nDaniel Miller, a Los Angeles advertising executive, dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to Judgment City, a Purgatory-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased, where he will have his life on Earth judged. Daniel and the rest of the departed are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities while they undergo their judgment processes — from delicious, calorie-free all-you-can-eat buffets, to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.\n\nDaniel's defense attorney, Bob Diamond, explains that people from Earth use so little of their brains (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their fears. \"When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me,\" says Diamond. If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer. Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.\n\nAt Daniel's tribunal, presided over by two judges, Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase, but his formidable opponent, Lena Foster, takes the opposing argument. Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in Daniel's life to make their case to the judges.\n\nDuring the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia, a recently deceased woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his. Meanwhile, things do not go well for Daniel. Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps, while Diamond vigorously attempts to portray Daniel's actions in a more positive light. Following each day's proceedings, Daniel and Julia spend time exploring Judgement City.\n\nOn the last day of the hearing, Foster plays footage of Daniel's previous night with Julia, in which he declines to spend the night with her despite his strong feelings for her. Foster believes this clearly underscores Daniel's fear and lack of courage. It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth. Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on. Before saying goodbye, Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right. Daniel remains disappointed.\n\nDaniel boards a tram poised to return to Earth when he spots Julia on a different tram. On impulse, he unstraps himself, leaps from the moving tram, dodges traffic and suffers electric shocks and injury to get to Julia. Unable to enter her tram, he clings precariously to the outside of the moving vehicle, banging on the door and trying to pry it open. The scene pulls back to show that the entire event is being watched by Diamond, Foster, and the judges in the chamber where Daniel's hearing took place. Diamond remarks to Foster, \"Brave enough for you?\" Foster has no reply other than letting a bit of a smile slip as well. One of the judges sends a message ordering the tram doors opened. Daniel and Julia are reunited, to the applause of the other passengers, and embrace as they are allowed to move on to the next phase of existence together.\n\n\nShirley MacLaine has a cameo appearance as the holographic host of the \"Past Lives Pavilion\"— a reference to her publicly known belief in reincarnation.\n\nBrooks worked on the story for over two years. \"I wanted the equation to be a non-religious, non-heaven-like after-life,\" he said. \"And I think the most interesting thing about the movie is what it says about earth. . . . Self-examination got a bad rap with all the yuppies turning inward. I think it's an important thing to do.\" \n\nStreep was announced for the cast in November, 1989. Brooks explained, \"I'm friends with Carrie Fisher and they worked together in \"Postcards From The Edge\" and we had dinner. Meryl joked and said, 'Is there a part for me?' I said, 'Yeah, right.' I would never have thought of her because I thought she was so unapproachable. But she's remarkably approachable. She's so average it's ridiculous. And so funny!\" Brooks rewrote the part for Streep. \"Comedy is rhythms. Writing is rhythms,\" he explained. \"If you're writing and you have a specific person in mind, the imitative part of you copies that person a little bit and you get closer to that person's rhythms than your own.\"\n\nFilming began on Feb. 15, 1990. The film's plot was a well-guarded secret throughout production. Some scenes were shot at Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley, a suburb in Orange County, California, as well as Irvine and Anaheim. The film was released on March 22, 1991.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics and holds a 97% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.66/10.\n\n\"Variety\" called it an \"inventive and mild bit of whimsy\" in which Brooks has a \"little fun with the Liliom idea of being judged in a fanciful afterlife, but he doesn't carry his conceit nearly far enough.\" Roger Ebert called it \n\"funny in a warm, fuzzy way\" and a film with a \"splendidly satisfactory ending, which is unusual for an .\" \"The New York Times\" called it \"the most perceptive and convincing among a recent spate of \"carpe diem\" films\" — a reference to films such as \"Dead Poets Society\" (1989), \"Field of Dreams\" (1989) and \"Ghost\" (1990). Richard Schickel wrote:\n\n\"Defending Your Life\" is better developed as a situation than it is as a comedy (though there are some nice bits, the stand-up comedian asking Daniel how he died - \"on stage, like you\" and a hotel lobby sign that reads, WELCOME KIWANIS DEAD). But Brooks has always been more of a muser than a \"tummler\", and perhaps more depressive than he is manic. He asks us to banish the cha-cha-cha beat of conventional comedy from mind and bend to a slower rhythm. His pace is not that of a comic standing up at a microphone barking one-liners, but of an intelligent man sitting down by the fire mulling things over. And in this case offering us a large slice of angel food for thought.\n\nBob Mondello, on NPR, said, \"The result is not just his most mature comedy yet, but the best American comedy in years.\" J.Hoberman, in \"The Village Voice,\" called it \"Pure pleasure. Funny, deft, impressive comedy.\"\n\nThe film was not a box office success, grossing about $16 million in the United States. It received three Saturn Award nominations, for Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Fantasy Film, and Best Writing (Albert Brooks).\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\n\nRegarding the response from fans over the years, Brooks told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I've gotten thousands and thousands of letters of people who had relatives that were dying, or they were dying themselves, and the movie made them feel better. I guess it's because it presents some possibility that doesn't involve clouds and ghostly images.\"\n\n\"Defending Your Life\" was released on VHS and LaserDisc in early 1992. Warner Bros. Home Video released the film on DVD on April 3, 2001, in a cardboard snap case. It features 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formatting, subtitles in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, cast and crew information, and the film's theatrical trailer. Warner re-released the film in 2008 in a two-pack DVD set with Brooks' \"Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World\".\n\n\n"}

It is considered iconic by the Basque people.\n\n\"Pottoka\" is the Basque language name for this horse, both north and south of the mountains. In Upper Navarrese, \"potto\" and \"pottoka\" are generic terms for colts and young horses whereas in Lapurdian and Lower Navarrese the meaning of \"pottoka\" is \"pony\". Ultimately the name is linked to words such as \"pottolo\" \"chubby, tubby\".\n\nIn French sources, the spelling Pottok predominates. In English, both Pottoka and Pottok are encountered but the term Basque Pony can occasionally also be encountered.\n\nMany opinions exist on the origins of the Pottok. It is deemed by the scientific community to have lived in the area for at least several thousand years. It displays signs of genetic isolation and is genetically closest to breeds like the Asturcón, the Losino, the Galician, the Landais, and the Monchino horses. Tests have revealed considerable genetic differences between populations in the Northern Basque Country and the Southern Basque Country, leading some to consider them separate breeds.\n\nSome claim the Pottok's origins derive from the horses on ancient cave paintings in the area and thus claim to descend from the Magdalenian horses of 14,000–7000 BC. Other link its origins to an influx of horses during the Bronze Age. However, neither of these theories has to date been scientifically verified.\nGenetic research by the University of the Basque Country's Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology department into various genetic markers amongst the 4 indigenous horse breeds in the Basque Country have examined their relationship to other horses. Based on microsatellite tests, of the four Basque horse breeds, the Pottok and the Basque Mountain Horse, are genetically the most distant from other breeds. The others, the Burguete horse and the Jaca Navarra (today considered meat breeds), less so. This variability in the Pottok and the Basque Mountain Horse appears to be related to the fact males mate range more widely and mate with more females in these feral or semi-feral herds.\n\nResearch into a known single-nucleotide polymorphism showed this non-native alternation is very rare in purebred Pottoks. Tests of mitochondrial DNA revealed Pottoks are most likely to crossbreed with the Basque Mountain Horses, less so with other breeds. Although some genetic markers of other European horse breeds were found, overall the genetic distance to the other European breeds is large. One marker previously only found in certain British breeds has also been found in Pottoks.\n\nIts traditional range extends west as far as the Biscayan Encartaciones and east roughly as far as the Saint-Jean-le-Vieux area. A census carried out in 1970 found roughly 3.500 purebred Pottoks north of the Pyrenees and approximately 2.000 purebreds to the south, a considerable drop from historic populations, linked to an overall drop in the number of horses being bred and used commercially. Competition with sheep and more recently commercial forestry has also infringed on the Pottok's natural habitat.\n\nThe traditional core habitat are the mountains of Labourd and Navarre from about 1.500m upwards, generally on poor acidic soil and limestone formations.\n\nThe Pottok measures in height, and weighs between . It has a large, square head, small ears, short neck and long back with short but slim legs, and small, sturdy hooves.\nThe winter fur (\"borra\") is one of the key characteristics of the Pottok and can reach up to in length on young horses. The archetypal coat colorations are in bay range with no patterning, but today various shades of brown and black exist in Pottok herds. Pottok pintos first appeared in Biscay in the 1850s and have spread to parts of Navarre and Labourd since.\n\nThere are noticeable differences between mountain herds of Pottok and valley or flatland herds, with mountain horses generally being smaller. The official French breed standard distinguishes two types, the or Mountain Pottok, with a height range of , and the larger or Plains Pottok, which has a height range of .\n\nThe Government of Biscay carried out research into some 250 horses of the Pottok population of Biscay, both wild and stabled, in 1996–97. The census revealed that the majority of semi-feral Pottoks in Biscay live in the far northwest of the province, in the Encartaciones. These semi-feral herds are rounded up twice a year, once in March before birthing and once in October after weaning. The survey also concluded that the main characteristics of the Biscayan population were:\n\nSemi-feral Pottoks tend to be shy and live in small, territorial herds or harems numbering between 10–30 mares. They are able to predict the weather conditions, moving into the valleys in anticipation of bad weather and upland when high pressure builds. During the autumn, the herd breaks up into smaller groups of 5–10 horses and re-unite in spring.\n\nFoals mature quickly. Fillies become fertile at age 2, normally mate at age 3 and give birth at age 4, which is also the age of maturity for males. Foals, like those of other breeds, are born after 11 months during spring/early summer and are weaned after 6–7 months.\n\nPottok numbers have been severely reduced by habitat loss and crossbreeding. In the 20th century, piebald Pottoks were bred, particularly for circus use. Stockier ponies for agricultural work were bred by crossbreeding with draught horses, also often with a large variety of coat colours.\n\nThey have also been bred with Iberian horses following guidelines of pony clubs, Arabian horses and Welsh ponies. This cross-breeding has left perhaps no more than 150 purebred mares north of the Pyrenees.\n\nTheir adaptation to mountain life and coloration made them ideal for use by smugglers in former times. From the 16th Century onwards, they became popular as circus horses but also as pit ponies in France and Britain. Today, they are in demand as children's ponies because they adapt well to domestication.\n\nEfforts are now being made to ensure the continued survival of purebred Pottoks. The Pottok was the first Basque horse breed to be included in the list of indigenous Basque breeds requiring conservation efforts in June 1995. Its status was classified as endangered.\n\nVarious reserves, for example in Bidarray in Lower Navarre or the ZAPE Society in the Aralar Range have been set up to protect the pony and its environment. There is much debate about how best to increase numbers – whether to focus only on the purebreds or to employ selective crossbreeding to build greater numbers of Pottok-like ponies.\n\nPottok are shown both at agricultural shows and town festivals:\n\nIn the Northern Basque Country, two studbooks for the Pottok were set up in 1970. Crossbreds, covered under Book B, must have at least 50% Pottok blood, while Book A covers those of higher purity. Horses in Book A are divided into two types, the Mountain Pottok and the Plains Pottok. Only horses which live for a minimum of nine months in the year in semi-feral conditions in a harem containing mares, foals and stallions in the mountainous areas of la Rhune, Baïgorry, Ursuya and Artzamendi are considered Mountain Pottoks.\n\nThe breed standard specifies:\n\nIn the Southern Basque Country, the criteria specify:\n\nAccording to an atlas of Basque breeds compiled by IKT Nekazal Ikerketa eta Teknologia (Agricultural Research and Technology), there were 986 Pottoks in the Basque Autonomous Community in 1997; 40 in Álava, 849 in Biscay and 97 in Gipuzkoa.\n\nIn 2005 Switzerland was the only other country holding a studbook recognised by the French breed standard and regulations. This has been kept since 2000 by the Swiss Pottok Society, which since 2004 is a member of the Swiss Society for Ponies and Small Horses SVPK.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the 16th largest tram system in the world by route length, in 2017 providing 149.1 million journeys (up 9.5% on 2016) over routes 140.6 km in length. In 2018, the Brussels tram system consisted of 18 tram lines (eight of which – lines 3, 4, 7, 25, 32, 51, 55 and 82 – qualified as pre metro lines, and five of which - lines 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 - qualified as \"Chrono\" or \"Fast\" lines). Its development has demonstrated many of the quandaries that face local public transport planners. The Brussels tram system also has several interesting peculiarities: the inconsistent route pattern resulting from the closure of the interurban trams, the conflict between low-floor surface trams and high-floor underground trams, and whether the trams run on the right or the left.\n\nBelgium's first horse-drawn trams were introduced in Brussels in 1869, running from the Porte de Namur to the Bois de la Cambre.\n\nIn 1877 a steam tram was introduced but it was not powerful enough for the hilly terrain and the tests were stopped. Simultaneously the \"Tramways Bruxellois\" experimented with a locomotive built in Tubize but it did not work either. The components proved too fragile and this experiment was also discontinued. In 1887 experiments were made with accumulator trams, but these had a very limited range. Trolley power, used in Liège, was also tried in Brussels and in 1894 Brussels’s first electric tram lines were laid from Place Stéphanie/Stefanieplein to Uccle/Ukkel. Several companies built their own tram lines until the turn of the century, the most important being:\n\nIn addition, there were smaller companies:\n\nThese last two companies used metre-gauge track and started with steam traction instead of with horse trams. In 1899, the TB was granted a 45-year concession on condition that the whole network was electrified, a condition that was met in the following years. Until the First World War, many investments were made in the network, such as heavier rails and more powerful trams. The \"vicinal/buurtspoor\" networks set up city services.\n\nTram services were not restored to normality until 1925. During the war there was poor maintenance, many horses were requisitioned and tram equipment was used for military purposes. On 1 January 1928, the TB and CFE networks merged, leaving only the TB and the \"vicinal/buurtspoor\" network in operation. The CFE was known for its 'chocolate bars' so named because of their dark brown livery (several examples can still be admired in the Brussels tram museum). CFE personnel also wore brown uniforms. In 1928 the CFE lines were renumbered within the TB system. In 1935, the Brussels tram network was 240 kilometres long, making it one of the larger tram networks in Europe. There were almost 100 tram lines, including many direct connections between the various boroughs. For the World Exhibition of 1935, the famous '5000-series' trams, the first in Brussels with two bogies, were put into service.\n\nBecause the TB concession expired on 31 December 1945, an agreement was concluded between the State and the Province of Brabant to continue the operation of the Brussels trams. A provisional management committee was set up, which functioned until the foundation, on 1 January 1954, of the \"Société des Transports Intercommunale de Bruxelles/Maatschappij voor de Intercommunaal Vervoer in Brussel\" (STIB/MIVB). Great efforts were made to catch up on overdue maintenance and 787 motor trams were modernised to the Brussels standard type. The electro-pneumatic brake was introduced in these cars and the conductor and driver (called \"Wattman\" in Belgium) had permanent seats.\n\nGrowing traffic congestion led to plans to build reserved tracks for trams, and in the city centre to put them in tunnel. In 1957, the first tunnel was opened near the congested Constitution Square, between the South Station and Lemonnier. From 1969, trams were adapted to run in tunnel, using block signalling.\n\nIn addition to the major refurbishment of the standard cars, STIB/MIVB had a great need for modern equipment to serve the World Exhibition in 1958 (Expo 58), to which its organisers wished to provide public transport access from all the city. To this end, large turning loops for hundreds of trams were laid out in the exhibition grounds. Between 1951 and 1953, the PCC car entered Brussels with motor car 7001, the start of a series of 172 cars. Over the years, many series of single-ended versions (7500 and 7700 series, 128 car) and double-ended versions (7900 series, 61 cars) followed. Eventually, the PCC car entirely replaced motor wagon and trailer combinations.\n\nThe development of the premetro, a tram-unfriendly policy and a constant shortage of funds led to a deterioration of the Brussels tram system well into the 1990s, with many routes being replaced by metro lines or converted to bus routes. Only with investment in new equipment (the T2000 tram) and the upgrading and improvement of the tram network did the balance turn positive.\n\nThe system exists in a somewhat unusual local government context, because Brussels is a self-governing region, as an enclave within Flanders, although only some 3.3 kilometres from Wallonia at the closest point. This means that three-way deals are necessary between Brussels’ own STIB/MIVB, Flanders’ De Lijn and Wallonia’s TEC.\n\nSTIB sees itself as a provider of \"mobility\" rather than just public transport, and has a 49% share in the Cambio carsharing franchise. The Brussels conurbation — 19 municipalities plus adjoining commuter belt — is also served by a fairly dense network of main-line trains. The MOBIB contactless smart card can be used on buses, trams, the metro and for mainline railway season tickets, and is gradually being extended to other modes, although it is not yet accepted for single journeys by De Lijn. A simple tariff system permits unlimited changes with a one-hour period for €2.50 when bought from the driver, €2.10 from a ticket machine. Real-time arrival indicators have been installed at many tram stops.\n\nRidership has been rising, and user-friendly features that have grown up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually make a point of waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.\n\nAs of 2017, there are 17 tram routes, totalling , and serving most parts of the city, including three partial ring routes (7, 8, and 81). The routes have a very varied feel, including street running through narrow streets in working-class districts (line 81), cobbled central reservation, reserved track through parkland and woods (line 44), signal-controlled running in tunnels (the \"premetro\" lines 3 and 4 in the North–South Axis, and 7), and short stretches in cutting (the old route 18, closed in 2007). Almost all trams are double-ended and all are double-sided, and while some stub termini remain (4, 51, 97), most have loops. The route pattern shows some notable gaps, particularly along major radial routes, because these were originally served by the national network of \"buurtspoorwegen/tramways vicinaux\". These had a gauge of one metre, rather than the Brussels standard gauge, and so the tracks could not easily be taken over when the lines were progressively closed from the 1960s onwards.\n\nThe complementary routing of \"vicinal\" and urban tracks and the replacement of key lines by metro has led to some peculiar track layouts, for instance at the Barrière de St-Gilles/Bareel St-Gillis. Though all seven roads at this circular junction originally had tram lines, only three of the original seven remain. To negotiate a sharp turn, the old route T18 (closed 1 July 2007) had to make a 270-degree turn on its journey away from the city centre, looping round and crossing its own path.\n\nUnder the South station, the premetro and metro tracks swap from running on the right to running on the left where they run parallel to provide cross-platform interchange between the two lines. This serves no apparent purpose, but may be because main line trains in Belgium run on the left. Trams cross back to the right under Place Bara but the metro stays on the left as far as the Roi Baudouin terminus.\n\nBy 2016, Bruxelles Mobilité/Brussel Mobiliteit had installed traffic light priority for trams or buses at 150 junctions. In some other places, the track layout is used to avoid hold-ups; for instance on route 92 at the Ma Campagne and Place Janson crossroads, which lie 300 metres from each other on the Chaussée de Charleroi/Charleroisesteenweg. There is lateral space for only one track in a raised central reservation, and the rails swerve to the left approximately 100 metres in front of the junction so that cars can queue in the right-hand lane.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2009, a phased transformation of the network took place, with the aim of improving regularity and relieving overcrowding. The premetro service between North station and Albert was restructured with fewer lines passing through it, but at more regular intervals. These routes use the new longer Bombardier trams. The major part of the North-South Axis (from Lemonnier to Rogier) is now used only by lines 3 and 4 during the day, branded \"Chrono\". Tram line 55 from Schaerbeek (north of Brussels) that used to use the North-South Axis now terminates at Rogier. The old line 52 was replaced by line 3 in the north (from Brussels-South railway station to Thomas and from Van Praet to Esplanade), 82 (from Drogenbos to Lemonnier) and 32 in the south. The old tram line 56 was also withdrawn.\n\nA previously implemented part of the plan was the creation of line 25 in April 2007. Line 25 goes from Rogier to the Boondael/Boondaal railway station following the route of the former line 90 from Rogier to Buyl, then leaves the outer ring towards the Université Libre de Bruxelles campus of Solbosch.\n\nOn March 14, 2011, old lines 23 and 24 were merged to create the new eastern semicircular premetro line 7 which runs almost entirely in its own right of way from Heizel/Heysel in the north to Vanderkindere in the south.\n\nTram routes :\n\n\nStricken-out numbers represent partial services (they do not go up to the end of the line). Only regular services are shown in this list.\n\nIn the 21st-century political climate, investment in light rail has again taken off, and a number of extensions to the system are at various stages of fruition.\n\nLines 3, 7 and 9 are to be connected at the Heysel/Heizel, and on 20 December 2018, Brussels Mobility Minister Pascale Smet announced that the next two lines to be built, estimated to open in 2024, will run:\nThe Flemish region, under its \"Brabantnet\" plan, intends to build a new line to the north of the city, from Heysel/Heizel to Willebroek alongside the A12 road. Its success will require integration with the existing Brussels regional system; for instance the line will have to be built at standard rather than metre gauge (as the other Flemish trams are).\n\nThree other suburban/interurban lines had been proposed:\n\nThe first two proposals were withdrawn, while the last is to be implemented in 2019 as a 'tram-bus'.\n\nOther proposals have been aborted. During 2014 and 2015 STIB/MIVB promoted a project to 'tramify' the Porte de Namur/Naamsepoort to Delta section of the overloaded 71 bus route, which carries over 12,000 passengers per day in each direction. The Brussels region supported the proposal, but the municipality of Ixelles/Elsene was against, supported by traders on the Chaussée dÍxelles/Elsensesteenweg who feared the disruption the tracklaying would cause. The proposal was dropped and instead the section from the Chaussée de Wavre/Waversesteenweg to Place Fernand Coq/Fernand Coqplein has been made largely car-free.\n\nOther outline proposals have been made to:\n\nOn 18 July 2019 the Brussels government, in its programme for the period 2019-2024, committed itself to set the following additional developments in train: \n\nTrack is renewed periodically, both when it wears out, and also to increase the lateral clearance between tracks, to enable the safe passage of wider trams. Minor imperfections are smoothed by in-situ welding. When a temporary diversion is required, STIB/MIVB often installs a set of temporary or 'Californian' points which sits on top of the permanent rails.\n\nTrack has historically been embedded in stone setts, with STIB/MTUB taking responsibility for the road up to 30 cm on either side of the rails. However recently tarmac has been used, which improves conditions for cyclists.\n\nIn recent years when major junctions have been relaid, the opportunuity has been taken to increase stability by installing a concret raft underneath the whole junction.\n\nOn the overground parts of the network trams drive at sight, while the underground \"premetro\" sections have block signalling. However drivers do not need to check in and out of the signalled section as on the Muni system in San Francisco. An exception is in the earliest tunnel to be built, at the Lemonnier stop, where passengers cross the tracks using an underground level crossing. This station will be bypassed when the line is converted to heavy metro and the new \"Constitution\" station built slightly to its east.\n\nAs of 18 September 2017, the fleet consists of 396 trams, of the following types:\nAs of 18 June 2019, 90 new sets of Flexities are on order.\n\nThe development of the system is being pulled in two contradictory directions – towards low-floor street-running trams and high-floor underground railway. This has led to some conflicting decisions. The standard trams — still \"PCC's from the 1950s and 60s — have been followed by the specially designed \"T2000\" low-floor model and, at the end of 2005, by a variant of the off-the-shelf \"Flexity Outlook\" from Bombardier (3000 series), and, at the end of 2006, by an even longer version of the same family (4000 series).\n\nOn some of the busiest routes, the convenience of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, so most of the platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the upward direction) by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a cutout section taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails make life difficult for passengers with baby buggies or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein.\n\nCoupled sets are not currently used, although since c. 2015 tests have been made of pairs of PCCs connected by a towbar.\n\nBrussels trams have known several liveries. In the beginning of the 20th century, those operated by the \"Tramways Bruxellois\" were dark green, and those by the \"Chemins de Fer Economiques\" were chocolate. The two companies merged in the 1920s, whereupon a standard livery of primrose yellow was adopted which lasted (with some minor changes in the trimmings) until the mid-1990s when a brighter shade of yellow was adopted.\n\nA profound change in livery came in 2006 with the adoption of the so-called \"art nouveau\" livery of silver and light brown on the new 3000 and 4000 vehicles. The rest of the active fleet has been repainted.\n\nThe system exists in happy symbiosis with an active heritage operation based at Woluwe depot, and privately hired trams have free access to the tracks. Trams that still collect their current through trolley poles rather than pantographs are normally restricted to the scenic line from Cinquantenaire park via Woluwe to Tervuren, which is run with the help of volunteers from the preservation society MTUB (Museum of Brussels Urban Transport), whose board has a strong representation from STIB/MIVB. This runs at weekends from April to October; occasionally, such as on the Belgian national holiday, 21 July, these trams appear in the city centre, where the line in the Koningsstraat/Rue Royale is trolleypole-enabled.\n\nSeveral trams have been sent to the United States. Tram 7037 is in San Francisco operating on the F-Line, surreally repainted in the blue-and-white livery of Zürich. Tram 1504 is at the Trolley Museum of New York and 1511 is at Old Pueblo Trolley. A 4-axle PCC is also awaiting restoration at the Ontario St shed of Vancouver's Downtown Historic Railway.\n\nOne PCC tram was converted in 2012 into a mobile restaurant, which operates six evenings per week. Its fleet number is 7601, formerly 7765 and before that 7565.\n\nA second PCC tram, 7126, serves as a mobile studio for the \"Le Tram\" television programme broadcast by BX1 (formerly Télé Bruxelles) every other Sunday, during which an interview is conducted while the tram tours Brussels. The tram tows a generator trailer.\n\nFrom January 21 to March 21, 2010, a demonstration streetcar project, known as the Olympic Line, at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, used cars 3050 & 3051 (Bombardier Flexity Outlook) on a Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway 1.8 km track.\n\nSTIB/MIVB has 7 depots and maintenance facilities:\n\n\nMost of these statistics come from STIB/MIVB's 2018 activity report, though some are from previous reports.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2304654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304654", "title": "Second Battle of Rivas", "text": "Second Battle of Rivas\n\nThe Second Battle of Rivas occurred on 11 April 1856 between Costa Rican militia under General Mora and the Nicaraguan forces of William Walker. The lesser known First Battle of Rivas took place on the 29 June 1855 between Walker's forces and the forces of the Chamorro government of Nicaragua.\n\nAt the time, a major trade route between New York City and San Francisco ran through southern Nicaragua. Ships from New York would enter the San Juan River from the Atlantic and sail across Lake Nicaragua.\n\nPeople and goods would then be transported by stagecoach over a narrow strip of land near the city of Rivas, before reaching the Pacific and being shipped to San Francisco. The commercial exploitation of this route had been attained from a previous Nicaraguan administration to Wall Street tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company. Garrison and Morgan had wrested control of the company from Vanderbilt and then supported Walker's expedition. Vanderbilt spread rumors that the company was issuing stock illegally in order to depress its value, allowing him to regain controlling interest.\n\nIn July 1856, Walker set himself up as president of Nicaragua, after conducting a farcical election. As ruler of Nicaragua, Walker then revoked the Transit Company's charter, claiming that it had violated the agreement, and granted use of the route back to Garrison and Morgan. Outraged, Vanderbilt successfully pressured the U.S. government to withdraw its recognition of Walker's regime. Walker had also scared his neighbors and American and European investors with talk of further military conquests in Central America. Vanderbilt financed and trained a military coalition of these states, led by Costa Rica, and worked to prevent men and supplies from reaching Walker. He also provided defectors from Walker's army with payments and free passage back to the U.S.\n\nRealising that his position was becoming precarious, he sought support from the Southerners in the U.S. by recasting his campaign as a fight to spread the institution of black slavery, which many American Southern businessmen saw as the basis of their agrarian economy. With this in mind, Walker revoked Nicaragua's emancipation edict of 1824. This move did increase Walker's popularity in the South and attracted the attention of Pierre Soulé, an influential New Orleans politician, who campaigned to raise support for Walker's war. Nevertheless, Walker's army, thinned by an epidemic of cholera and massive defections, was no match for the Central American Coalition and Vanderbilt's agents.\n\nCosta Rican President Juan Rafael Mora watched with concern as Walker consolidated his forces and power in Nicaragua. Fearing that Walker would become unbeatable and at the urging and backing of Vanderbilt's business empire Mora declared war, not on Nicaragua, but on Walker and his filibusters, on the 1 March 1856. Having been talking about the filibusters for a while, Mora made this declaration in a famous speech that begins with the words, \"Countrymen, take your weapons, the time that I've been warning you has arrived\" (a paraphrase of the opening words of the Marseillaise).\n\nEnraged Walker ordered the invasion of Costa Rica and a filibuster force crossed the border into Guanacaste, while the Costa Rican army moved down from the Central Valley in the same direction. With the army traveled the President but command was in the hands of his brother, Jose Joaquin Mora, and his brother-in-law, General Cañas. Upon hearing that a small contingent of men were encamped near the city of Guanacaste's Hacienda Santa Rosa Mora led three thousand of his men to attack. Walker's men were under the command of Colonel Louis Schlessinger, an inexperienced officer. On the 20 March with no sentries posted, Mora's Costa Ricans surprised and attacked the small group; Schlessinger himself ran away, leaving his troops vulnerable, disorganised, and without leadership.\n\nWalker alarmed by the defeat heard unfounded rumors that Mora's army was going to attack from the North. So he foolishly decided to abandon the key city of the Nicaragua at that time and meet the army from the north. Mora quickly slipped into Rivas with 3,000 men. \n\nWalker, just four days after giving up the city, marched his men back into Rivas to try to take it back. His small force was able to score a number of victories through street to street fighting and were able to create a stalemate at a key building in town, El Mesón de Guerra, the Guerra family home, which was located in the corner of the park, covered the approach to Rivas church; from the towers of the church Walker's snipers enjoyed a wide firing range.\n\nJuan Santamaría, a drummer boy from the town of Alajuela, had volunteered for his country's impromptu militia. When the commanding officer asked for a volunteer to set fire to El Mesón de Guerra — the filibusters' stronghold, he approached the hostel and tossed his torch onto the thatched roof. This caused the enemy to flee, although Santamaria was cut down by sniper fire in the process.\n\nCarrasco who was serving the militia as a cook and impromptu medic, filled her apron pockets with bullets, grabbed a discarded rifle and shamed some of the retreating Costa Ricans forestalling what might have become a rout.\n\nJuan Alfaro Ruiz was responsible for clearing the filibusters from the church. He died of cholera after the battle. One of Alajuela's cantons was named after him.\n\nWalker and his surviving soldiers fled to Granada during the night. Several factions inside the Costa Rican Army sought to pursue and kill Walker, thus ending the war. President Mora cancelled the plan, seeing his troops were already battle-worn. Mora wanted to use his resources to bury the dead and take care of the wounded and sick. Although Costa Rica was victorious in the Battle of Rivas, the country could not enjoy the victory. Bodies from the fighting were dumped in the wells of the city causing a huge outbreak of cholera.\n\nThinking the cholera was brought by the hot weather of the Nicaraguan lowlands, the troops wanted to go back home. The Costa Rican troops brought the disease home to Costa Rica with them where it ravaged the entire country, killing one tenth of the population. Mora was blamed for the cholera outbreak, the severe losses inflicted to the army and for the economic damage to the country because of the war debts. A coup was planned for his return to the capital but this was aborted.\n\nThe war against Walker would continue, joined now by the armies of other Central American countries under the overall command of General Mora, focused on cutting the men and weapons flow to the filibusters cutting the transit route. After the war, Mora was removed from power in 1859 and executed in 1860 when he tried to come back to power along General Cañas.\n\nMcCloskey, J. J. Autobiography of an Old Player contains many references to William Walker.\n\n"}

He boarded the scheduled flight as a deadhead passenger carrying a guitar case concealing several hammers and a speargun.

He was convicted of multiple charges, including attempted murder, attempted air piracy, and interference with flight crew operations. He received two consecutive life sentences. Calloway successfully appealed the conviction for interference, which was ruled to be a lesser offense of attempted air piracy.\n\nThree flight crew members were in the cockpit on this particular flight: 49-year-old Captain David Sanders; 42-year-old first officer James Tucker; and 39-year-old flight engineer Andrew Peterson.\n\nAlso in the airplane was 42-year-old FedEx flight engineer Auburn Calloway, an alumnus of Stanford University and a former Navy pilot and martial arts expert, who was facing possible dismissal over falsifying of flight hours. In order to disguise the hijacking as an accident, so his family would benefit from his US$2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) life insurance policy, Calloway intended to murder the flight crew using blunt force. To accomplish this, he brought on board two claw hammers, two club hammers, a speargun, and a knife (which was not used) concealed inside a guitar case. He also carried with him a note written to his ex-wife and \"describing the author's apparent despair\". Just before the flight, Calloway had transferred over US$54,000 () in securities and cashier's checks to his ex-wife.\n\nBefore takeoff, as part of his plan to disguise the intended attack as an accident, Calloway attempted to disable the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) by pulling its circuit breaker to interrupt CVR power. During the standard pre-flight checks, flight engineer Peterson noticed the pulled breaker and reset it before takeoff so the CVR was reactivated. However, if Calloway killed the crew members with the CVR still on, he would simply have had to fly for 30 minutes to erase any trace of a struggle from the CVR's 30-minute loop.\n\nAbout twenty minutes after takeoff, as the flight crew carried on a casual conversation, Calloway went into the back to get his weapons and entered the flight deck and commenced his attack. All three members of the crew received multiple hammer blows. Both Peterson and first officer Tucker suffered fractured skulls, and Peterson's temporal artery was severed. The blow to Tucker's head initially rendered him unable to move or react but he was still conscious. Captain Sanders reported that during the beginning of the attack, he could not discern any emotion from Calloway, just \"simply a face in his eyes\".\n\nWhen Calloway ceased his hammer attack, Peterson and Sanders began to get out of their seats to counter-attack. Calloway left the cockpit and retrieved his spear gun. He came back into the cockpit and threatened everyone to sit back down in their seats. Despite loud ringing in his ear and being dazed, Peterson grabbed the gun by the spear between the barbs and the barrel. A lengthy struggle ensued, while Tucker, also an ex-Navy pilot, performed extreme aerial maneuvers with the aircraft. He pulled the plane into a sudden 15-degree climb, throwing Sanders, Peterson and Calloway out of the cockpit and into the galley. To try to throw Calloway off balance, Tucker then turned the plane into a left roll, almost on its side. This rolled the combatants along the smoke curtain onto the left side of the galley.\n\nEventually, Tucker had rolled the plane almost upside down at 140 degrees, while attempting to maintain a visual reference of the environment around him through the windows. Peterson, Sanders and Calloway were then pinned to the ceiling of the plane. Calloway managed to wrench his hammer hand free and hit Sanders in the head again. Just then, Tucker put the plane into a steep dive. This pushed the combatants back to the seat curtain, but the wings and elevators started to flutter. At this point Tucker could hear the wind rushing against the cockpit windows. At , the plane's elevators fluttered so much that the control surfaces became unresponsive due to the disrupted airflow. This tested the aircraft’s safety limits. Tucker realized this was because the throttles were at full power. Releasing his only usable hand to pull back the throttles to idle, he managed to pull the plane out of the dive while it slowed down.\n\nCalloway managed to hit Sanders again while the struggle continued. Sanders was losing strength and Peterson was heavily bleeding from a ruptured artery. In spite of his diminishing strength, Sanders managed to grab the hammer out of Calloway's hand and attacked him with it. When the plane was completely level, Tucker reported to Memphis Center, informed them about the attack and requested a vector back to Memphis. He requested an ambulance and \"armed intervention\", meaning he wanted SWAT to storm the plane.\n\nThe flight crew eventually succeeded in restraining Calloway, although only after moments of inverted and near-transonic flight beyond the designed capabilities of a DC-10. Sanders took control and Tucker, who had by then lost use of the right side of his body, went back to assist Peterson in restraining Calloway. Sanders communicated with air traffic control, preparing for an emergency landing back at Memphis International Airport. Meanwhile, after screaming that he could not breathe, Calloway started fighting with the crew again.\n\nHeavily loaded with fuel and cargo, the plane was approaching too fast and too high to land on the scheduled runway 9. A fully loaded airliner could break up upon landing at these conditions. Sanders requested by radio to land on the longer runway 36L. Ignoring warning messages from the onboard computer and using a series of sharp turns that tested the DC-10's safety limits, Sanders landed the jet safely on the runway at over its maximum designed landing weight. By that time, Calloway was once again restrained. Emergency personnel and police gained access to the plane via escape slide and ladder. Inside, they found the interior of the galley and cockpit covered in blood. Calloway was then arrested and taken off the plane.\n\nThe crew of Flight 705 sustained serious injuries. The left side of Tucker's skull was severely fractured, causing motor control problems in his right arm and right leg. Calloway had also dislocated Tucker's jaw, attempted to gouge out one of his eyes and stabbed his right arm. Sanders suffered several deep gashes in his head and doctors had to sew his right ear back in place. Flight engineer Peterson's skull was fractured and his temporal artery severed. The aircraft itself incurred damages in the amount of $800,000.\n\nCalloway pleaded temporary insanity but was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences (federal sentences are not subject to parole) on August 11, 1995, for attempted murder and attempted air piracy. Calloway, Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate #14601-076, is imprisoned in the medium-security United States Penitentiary, Lompoc, in Santa Barbara County, California, as of September 2019.\nOn May 26, 1994, the Air Line Pilots Association awarded Dave Sanders, James Tucker, and Andrew Peterson the Gold Medal Award for heroism, the highest award a civilian pilot can receive. In 2004, ten years after the incident and due to the extent and severity of their injuries, none of the crew had been recertified as medically fit to fly commercially. However, James Tucker returned to recreational flying in his Luscombe 8A by 2002.\n\nAs of March 2020, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft involved, N306FE, remains in service as an upgraded MD-10 without the flight engineer position, although FedEx is in the process of phasing out their MD-10 aircraft in favor of the Boeing 767-300F. The plane first flew on December 6, 1985, and was delivered to FedEx on January 24, 1986.\n\nThe attempted hijacking of Flight 705 was featured in \"Fight for Your Life\", a season 3 (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series \"Mayday\" (called \"Air Emergency\" and \"Air Disasters\" in the U.S., and \"Air Crash Investigation\" in the UK), which included interviews with the flight crew. The dramatization was broadcast with the title \"Suicide Attack\" in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia.\n\nThe sixth episode of UK TV series \"Black Box\" (called \"Survival in the Sky\" in the U.S.), \"Sky Crimes\", also features the attempted takeover using audio between air traffic control and the crew.\n\nThe book \"Hijacked: The True Story of the Heroes of Flight 705\", written by Dave Hirschman, was published in 1997.\n\n\n"}

The mother will often drive her child to auditions, make sure he or she is on the set on time, etc. The term \"stage mother\" sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for her child, or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on her child to succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent.\n\nA stage mother may also be the official manager of her child (e.g., Rose Thompson Hovick, Dina Lohan, Ethel Gumm, Teri Shields, Susan Duff, etc.) — representing her child in negotiations for the professional services of her child. Such managers have often been referred to as \"momagers\" in the film industry.\n\nIn certain cases where a mother and child both work in the film industry, an automatic labeling of \"stage mother\" can be affixed to the mother without cause. Kathie Lee Gifford has been against the concept of stage mothers and had explained that when her son Cody co-starred with her in the film \"Model Behavior\", it had been on his own volition to try acting and not at her insistence. Gifford plays a stage mother in that movie.\n\nFathers have also been known to manage their children in this way, such as Joseph Jackson (patriarch of the Jackson family), Murry Wilson (father of three of The Beach Boys), Joe Simpson (father of Jessica and Ashlee Simpson), Jeff Archuleta (father of \"American Idol\" runner-up David Archuleta), Mathew Knowles (father of Beyoncé and Solange Knowles) and Kit Culkin (father of Macaulay and Kieran Culkin). A historical example of such a father was Leopold Mozart, who recognized his son's musical ability at an early age and made the most of it.\n\nAbraham Quintanilla, Jr., father of Tejano superstar Selena, is credited with having discovered Selena's gift of singing; he rounded up her and her siblings as a band (Selena y Los Dinos), named for his band in his younger days.\n\nStage fathers share a similar role with parents promoting their children in professional sports. The drive to enhance their child's success, and vicariously the father's own financial furtherance and fame can include implementation of strength and exercise regimens at a young age and backhanded actions such as delaying enrollment in school so their sons will be bigger than their classmates. Lavar Ball, father of NBA player Lonzo Ball, achieved notoriety for spurious self aggrandizement and inflation of his son's assets, including questionable claims that his son's basketball skills exceeded those of Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook.\n\nA variant of the term has been a \"script mother\", or a woman writer who sees her children as a means for writing books or screenplays based on humiliating events in the child's life, to the detriment of the child, or exaggerating a child's personal problems. Script mothers can be writers, comedians or cartoonists.\n\nAn example of a script mother has been Lynn Johnston, who has been criticized for exploiting her children (and husband) in her comic strip \"For Better or for Worse\", as opposed to many cartoonists such as Charles Schultz and Berke Breathed who make up fictional characters. Johnston's children eventually had to be pulled out of school due to the constant bullying and embarrassment they received in being compared to their comic strip counterparts, and placed into a private school with tougher regulations on student conduct.\n\n\nReal-life stage mothers and their children have been a popular subject for reality television shows, including the shows \"I Know My Kid's a Star\" (2008), \"Dance Moms\" (2011-present), \"Toddlers & Tiaras\" (2008-2013) and its highly successful spinoff \"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\" (2012-2014).\n\n"}

Along with the National Institute of Japanese Literature, the National Museum of Japanese History, and the National Museum of Ethnology, it is one of the National Institutes for the Humanities. The center is devoted to research related to Japanese culture.\n\nThe official origins of the institute are traced to an early study carried out by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture in 1982 on \"methods of comprehensive research on Japanese culture\". After surveying the field of Japanese studies for several years, the ministry, under the administration of Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro, established the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in 1987 in Kyoto with the prominent philosopher Umehara Takeshi as its first Director-General. Prominent Kyoto academics Umesao Nobuo and Kuwabara Takeo also played key roles in the founding of the center. \n\nIn 1990 the center moved to its current site in Oeyama-chō, Nishikyō-ku. In 1995 Kawai Hayao, a Jungian analyst of Japanese psychology and religion, was inaugurated as the second director-general of Nichibunken. In 2001, Yamaori Tetsuo, professor of Japanese religion and folklore, became the center's third director-general. The current director-general, Katakura Motoko, was inaugurated in 2005. She is Nichibunken's first female director-general and, as a cultural-anthropologist who specializes in Middle-Eastern Studies, she is also the center's first director-general who is not a Japan specialist.\n\nNichibunken was established against the backdrop of an increasing trade surplus with the United States in the 1980s. One of the ostensible impulses behind the founding of the center was a desire to change overseas perceptions of Japan that viewed the country as a faceless economic power. The cultural-anthropologist Ueno Chizuko sharply criticized the center as a calculated attempt at national branding. Ueno claimed that, despite the center's academic pretensions, the real purpose of Nichibunken was to improve the image of Japan in order to prevent criticism of Japanese trading practices and improve sales of Japanese goods abroad. Ian Buruma caused considerable outrage at the time for arguing in influential newspapers abroad that the establishment of the Center was part of a project designed to revamp the kind of nationalist ideology current in pre-war Japan. The center has also been criticized for promoting theories of Japanese particularism. \n\nThe appointment of Katakura Motoko as Nichibunken's fourth director-general may be seen as an attempt by the center to revamp its conservative image and distance itself from associations with theories of Japanese particularism. Katakura, a specialist in the anthropology of the Middle-East, is a relative outsider to the field of Japanese studies.\n\nA library of Japanese Studies is attached to the center. The collection primarily consists of books and bibliographic materials pertinent to the academic study of Japan. As of 2014, the library contains approximately 400,000 volumes of books in Japanese and 97,000 volumes in other languages. It also houses approximately 4,400 Japanese periodicals and about 1,000 foreign language periodicals. The library has also a significant storage of media materials in form of records, video and other digital forms.\n\nNichibunken publishes two periodicals in the field of Japanese studies: Japan Review in English and Nihon Kenkyū (in Japanese). Japan Review is a peer-reviewed journal available on JSTOR and on the Nichibunken website. Japan Review, which is published annually, accepts outstanding essays on Japanese culture from scholars across the globe, as well as research notes. It carries reviews of important books on Japanese studies. Japan Review also publishes Special Issues, the first of which was published in 2013 as \"Shunga: Sex and Humor in Japanese Art and Literature.\" The bi-annual Nihon Kenkyū is also peer reviewed and invites contributions from scholars everywhere.\n\nThe following databases are accessible from the Nichibunken webpage. Some of the databases require you to register and obtain a password.\n\nThis is a database of images of all rare books in Nichibunken's collection.

{"id": "2304703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304703", "title": "Alexander Dennis Enviro300", "text": "Alexander Dennis Enviro300\n\nThe Alexander Dennis Enviro300 (previously known as the TransBus Enviro300) is a light-weight full-size single-decker bus that was built by Alexander Dennis and its predecessor TransBus International between 2001 and 2015. The design was the first of the new Enviro range of buses from TransBus and also the first bus to be built as an integral bus by TransBus.\n\nThe Enviro300 was introduced in order to fill a gap in the manufacturer's product range. At the beginning the Cummins ISBe220 5.9-litre Euro III engine was provided as standard, but for Euro IV and V, the engine was the 6.7-litre ISBe with 225 hp for Euro IV and 225 or 250 hp for Euro V. There was a choice of 3 gearboxes: ZF Ecomat (originally 5HP502C, then 6HP504C), Allison T280R and Voith DIWA 854.5 (originally DIWA854.3E). The second generation Enviro300, with front end redesigned to match the Enviro200 and Enviro400, was launched in 2007.\n\nProduction of the Enviro300 ceased in 2015 with the introduction of a long-wheelbase Enviro200 MMC. More than 1,000 were produced.\n\nThe TransBus Enviro300 was launched in 2001 by TransBus International, becoming the first member of the Enviro range; with the collapse of TransBus in 2004, successors Alexander Dennis took over production and rebranded the Enviro300 as the Alexander Dennis Enviro300. In 2005, a school bus version was launched.\n\nA common design was used primarily that the bus has a single-curvature windscreen with a peaked roof dome and a separately mounted destination sign. The bus was developed to compete with the European-built heavy-weight single-decker buses sold in the United Kingdom, the most notable being Volvo. Many full-size (12m or more) single-decker buses are primarily designed for use on the continent and to carry a large number of standing passengers which is commonplace on the continent, but the Enviro300 was designed solely for the UK market where large numbers of standing passengers are not often carried. TransBus therefore believed that operators could make significant fuel savings by operating light-weight buses and produced a vehicle which is claimed to be lighter than its continental rivals but offer more seating capacity.\n\nThe Enviro300 had not sold as well as the manufacturer had hoped, though sales were not helped by the collapse of TransBus International in 2004. First Midland Red purchased 35. Arriva purchased at least 40. A small number of original style Enviro300s were sold to Stagecoach Group and Cardiff Bus.\n\nThe Enviro300 chassis was also able to be fitted with bodywork by other manufacturers, with Courtney Coaches purchasing East Lancs Esteem bodied examples in 2006. This was the first time the Enviro300 chassis being constructed with bodywork by another manufacturer.\n\nIn late 2007 Alexander Dennis introduced a second generation version of Enviro300 which featured styling cues similar to the Enviro200 Dart and the Enviro400. It had a single-piece windscreen covering the destination display (no longer a peaked roof dome similar to the Marshall Capital and the MCV Stirling). It was also available on MAN 18.240 and Volvo B7RLE chassis. The second generation Enviro300 was far more successful sales wise than its predecessor, with Arriva, FirstGroup and Stagecoach purchasing examples.\n\nStagecoach ordered 100 Enviro300 bodied MAN 18.240s in 2007 Further orders boosted the total number to over 350. In mid-2008 Ulsterbus ordered 45 Enviro300 bodied Volvo B7RLEs, which were the first to feature Volvo chassis since the introduction of this option, they were also built to a rural specification featuring unusual modifications such as narrower entrance doors, side wheelchair access door and 55 seatbelted seats in the form of 2+3 layout.\n\nIn January 2011, Stagecoach placed an order for 50 Enviro300s on the diesel-powered Scania K230UB chassis. These were followed by further 28 examples in 2012/13 and 28 in 2014/15.\n\nIn April 2013 Reading Buses took delivery of 20 gas-powered Enviro300SG buses based again on a Scania K UB chassis. These buses were jointly developed by Alexander Dennis and Scania, who had a demonstrator on loan to other operators from March 2013. Stagecoach North East purchased 40 Scania K270UBs in 2014.\n\nProduction of the Enviro300 ceased in late 2015 with the introduction of a long-wheelbase variant of the new Enviro200 MMC. The final Enviro300s were delivered to Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire in December 2015.\n\nIn the UK in 2019, DVSA (Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency) issued an instruction to all operators of the Enviro 300 to carry out additional safety checks of suspension components following several safety concerns raised by DVSA. ADL are expected to implement a number of technical measures and recalls to resolve these issues. \n\n"}
