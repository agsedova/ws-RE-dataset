He is known for his portrayal of Alan Bradley in \"Coronation Street\" from 1986 to 1989.\n\nEden was born in London and received little formal education, spending as a child almost two years in a TB sanatorium. However, having been introduced to the library by a teacher, he read the literary classics including Shakespeare. He left school aged 14, and worked on fairgrounds.\n\nAs Mark Eden, he has appeared at the Royal Court Theatre, and in repertory theatre in England and Wales. His television and film roles include the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Marco Polo\" (1964) in which he played Marco Polo, a reporter in \"Quatermass and the Pit\" in 1958, Number 100 in \"The Prisoner\" in 1967, and Inspector Parker in the TV adaptations of several Lord Peter Wimsey stories in the 1970s. Having briefly played a short lived character named Wally Randle in 1981, he returned for a long-running role in \"Coronation Street\", in which he played Alan Bradley.\n\nEden's time in \"Coronation Street\" came to an end in December 1989 after Bradley was killed by a Blackpool tram. In 2009, Eden unveiled a plaque at the tram stop where the scene was filmed.\n\nAfter leaving \"Coronation Street\", Eden said he received many casting offers for \"psycho\" roles. Prior to the show, Eden was often cast in roles of an upper-class gentleman. Eden worked on the stage and in radio plays. He also worked with the Beach Boys and wrote a musical about them.

A company owned by Charles Bent and William Bent and Ceran St. Vrain built the fort to trade with Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Plains Indians and trappers for buffalo robes. For much of its 16-year history, the fort was the only major white American permanent settlement on the Santa Fe Trail between Missouri and the Mexican settlements. It was destroyed in 1849.\n\nThe area of the fort was designated a National Historic Site under the National Park Service on June 3, 1960. It was further designated a National Historic Landmark later that year on December 19, 1960.\nThe fort was reconstructed and is open to the public.\n\nThe adobe fort quickly became the center of the Bent, St. Vrain Company's expanding trade empire, which included Fort Saint Vrain to the north and Fort Adobe to the south, along with company stores in New Mexico at Taos and Santa Fe. The primary trade was with the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians for buffalo robes.\n\nFrom 1833 to 1849, the fort was a stopping point along the Santa Fe Trail. It was the only permanent settlement not under the jurisdiction and control of Native Americans or Mexicans. The U.S. Army, explorers, and other travelers stopped at the fort to replenish supplies, such as water and food, and perform needed maintenance to their wagons. The American frontiersman Kit Carson was employed as a hunter by the Bent brothers in 1841, and regularly visited the Fort. Likewise, the explorer John C. Frémont used the Fort as both a staging area and a replenishment junction, for his expeditions. During the Mexican–American War in 1846, the fort became a staging area for Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny's \"Army of the West\".\n\nRalph Emerson Twitchell makes the following statement.\\\n\nBent's Fort is described as having been a structure built of adobe bricks. It was 180 feet long and 135 feet wide. The walls were 15 feet in height and four feet thick and it was the strongest post at that time west of Ft. Leavenworth. The construction of this fort was commenced in 1828 ... at a point on the Arkansas somewhere between the present cities of Pueblo and Canyon City, having been disadvantageously located. Four years were required in which to complete the structure. On the northwest and southeast corners were hexagonal bastions, in which were mounted a number of cannon. The walls of the fort served as walls of the rooms, all of which faced inwardly on a court or plaza. The walls were loopholed for musketry, and the entrance was through large wooden gates of very heavy timbers.\n\nIn 1849 when a great cholera epidemic struck the Cheyenne and other Plains Indians, William Bent abandoned Bent's Fort and moved his headquarters north to Fort Saint Vrain on the South Platte. When he returned south in 1852, he relocated his trading business to his log trading post at Big Timbers, near what is now Lamar, Colorado. Later, in the fall of 1853, Bent began building a stone fort on the bluff above Big Timbers, Bent's New Fort, where he conducted his trading business until 1860.\n\nWhen the fort was reconstructed in 1976, its authenticity was based on the use of archaeological excavations, paintings and original sketches, diaries and other existing historical data from the period.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It partly overlaps the rims of these two craters, making it the youngest of the three. The outer rampart of ejecta from Langmuir partly covers the southeast interior floor of Chebyshev.\n\nThis crater has not been heavily eroded, and many of its original features remain intact and sharply defined. The rim to the west is somewhat disrupted due to having overlaid the rim of the larger Chebyshev. In a coincidental arrangement, a small crater is situated across the rim edge at the northern end of where it joins with Chebyshev, and a smaller crater lies at the southern end of this merger.\n\nThe inner wall of Langmuir contains some minor terrace structures and displays some appearance of slumping along the southwestern edge. The inner wall in the southern half of the crater is wider than elsewhere, and is nearly twice as wide as the inner wall along the northern edge. As a result, the interior floor is offset to the north. There is a central peak formation on the floor, but it is located to the northeast of the midpoint.

An additional 24 acres was donated by Hallie Ismay in the late 1990s. It was one of many research national monuments designated during that era to preserve the ruins, plants and animals in the Yucca House area. Hallie Ismay, benefactor of the additional land in the 1990s, was an unofficial steward of the Yucca House site for 62 years.\n\nAs a National Park Service historic area, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

Administered by the National Park Service, Pipe Spring was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, and the boundaries of the Pipe Spring National Monument Historic District (a portion of the monument) were expanded in October 2000.\n\nThe water of Pipe Spring has made it possible for plants, animals, and people to live in this dry desert region. Ancestral Puebloans and Kaibab Paiute Indians gathered grass seeds, hunted animals, and raised crops near the springs for at least 1,000 years.\n\nAntonio Armijo discovered the springs when he passed through the area in 1829, when he established by the Armijo Route of the Old Spanish Trail.\n\nPipe Spring was named by the 1858 Latter-day Saint missionary expedition to the Hopi mesas led by Jacob Hamblin. In the 1860s Mormon pioneers from St. George, Utah, led by James M. Whitmore brought cattle to the area, and a large cattle ranching operation was established. In 1866 the Apache, Navajo and Paiute tribes of the region joined the Utes for the Black Hawk War, and, after they raided Pipe Spring, a protective fort was constructed by 1872 over the main spring. The following year the fort and ranch was purchased by Brigham Young for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The LDS Bishop of nearby Grafton, Utah, Anson Perry Winsor, was hired to operate the ranch and maintain the fort, soon called \"Winsor Castle\". This isolated outpost served as a way station for people traveling across the Arizona Strip, that part of Arizona separated from the rest of the state by the Grand Canyon. It also served as a refuge for polygamist wives during the 1880s and 1890s. The LDS Church lost ownership of the property through penalties involved in the federal Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887.\n\nAlthough their way of life was greatly impacted by Mormon settlement, the Paiute Indians continued to live in the area and by 1907 the Kaibab Paiute Indian Reservation was established, surrounding the privately owned Pipe Spring ranch. In 1923, the Pipe Spring ranch was purchased and set aside as a national monument to be a memorial to western pioneer life.\n\nToday the Pipe Spring National Monument, Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians Visitor Center, and Museum explain the human history of the area over time. Daily tours of Winsor Castle, summer \"living history\" demonstrations, an orchard and garden, and a half-mile trail offer a glimpse of American Indian and pioneer life in the Old West. The Paiute tribe runs a small adjoining campground.\n\nIn 1969, the actress Lane Bradbury played a young Eliza Stewart Udall at Pipe Spring in the syndicated television series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Robert Taylor not long before Taylor's own death. In the episode \"A Key for the Fort\", Miss Stewart, an ancestor of the Udall family, sends the first telegraph message from Arizona Territory and works with her Aunt Cora (Ivalou Redd) to nurse an ill Ute chief, Black Wing (George Keymas), back to health. The episode also stars Gregg Palmer as Jacob. It was filmed at Pipe Spring.\n\n\n"}

He played as a creative forward for Heart of Midlothian and Everton. He won league championship and cup titles with both clubs where he was also a regular goal scorer. Young later played for Glentoran and Stockport County. Internationally he played for the Scottish League and the Scotland national football team. In football folklore he has become known as 'The Golden Vision'.\n\nYoung was born in Loanhead. He described himself as shy from an understandably over-watchful mother having to cope with the death of a son five years older than Alex being fatally hit by a car. Young later said that as a youngster he grew up supporting the same team as his father, Motherwell. Young first played for Newtongrange Star in Midlothian, while he also worked as a colliery apprentice.\n\nHe joined Tommy Walker's Hearts in 1955 making his debut aged 18. This particular Hearts side had won their breakthrough tournament the year before winning the 1954 Scottish League Cup Final. With Young they next won the 1956 Scottish Cup Final. With Hearts' 'Terrible Trio' forward line of Jimmy Wardhaugh, Willie Bauld and Alfie Conn, Sr at their peak, Young played at right wing.\n\nHearts led the Scottish League for most of the 1956–57 season. The title hinged on Rangers visit to Tynecastle on 13 April. A capacity crowd watched a tense game in which Rangers keeper, George Niven, was man of the match. Hearts could not beat him and the only goal came from Simpson of Rangers who scored on the break in 35 minutes. Rangers had games in hand which they won to overtake Hearts and lift the trophy.\n\nYoung helped Hearts win the Scottish league championship in 1957–58, as part of a new Hearts goal scoring trinity with Wardhaugh and Jimmy Murray. In a crucial October visit to Ibrox, Young scored to transform a 2–0 deficit into a 3–2 win. On 12 April 1958 Hearts won 3–2 at St Mirren to clinch the title with Young scoring the winner. Wardhaugh was the League's top marksman with 28 strikes. This was one ahead of Jimmy Murray's 27 and four more than Young's 24. Hearts won that League title in 1957–58 with record-breaking points, goals scored and goal difference. Their record from 34 league games of 62 points out of a maximum possible 68 was 13 more than their nearest rival. They scored 132 goals (still the Scottish top tier record) with only 29 against for a record net difference of +103.\n\nYoung missed out on Hearts' October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final win. They led the league championship in December but with injuries taking their toll they lost 6–0 in a visit to Ibrox Park. This began a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games. Dave Mackay was sold in March to Tottenham Hotspur, but Hearts fought back into contention when they won 2–0 against Rangers in April. Rangers went into the last day of the season two points clear and needing a point to clinch the title. Rangers lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen, giving Hearts a chance to win the title, but they also lost 2–1.\n\nIn 1959/60 he scored 23 goals as Hearts won the league title again. In the New Year derby away to Hibs, Young's hat-trick inspired a 5–1 win. He played that season alongside his boyhood hero, Gordon Smith, who had joined Hearts that season. They also won the 1959 Scottish League Cup Final that season. Young playing at centre forward scored the winner for a second career goal to clinch a title.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1960, Young made 194 appearances for Heart of Midlothian in all competitions, scoring 103 goals. Young was inducted to the club's hall of fame in 2007.\n\nYoung was transferred in November 1960 to Everton, along with George Thomson, for £55,000. A partnership with Roy Vernon soon developed. Young scored 22 league goals in the 42 league games and made many other goals in Everton's 1962–63 league championship winning season. His elegant touch earned him the nickname of 'The Golden Vision', a title coined by Danny Blanchflower – \"\"...the view every Saturday that we have of a more perfect world, a world that has got a pattern and is finite. And that's Alex – the Golden Vision.\"\"\n\nIn addition to the championship, Young won an FA Cup winners medal in Everton's comeback win in the 1966 FA Cup Final. Young scored 89 goals in 275 appearances in all competitions for Everton. Young was at his prime when aged 23 – 26 when at Everton before being troubled by a knee injury. He also had career long issues with blistered feet that affected his performances.\n\nYoung was sold to Glentoran in 1968 for £10,000, and briefly managed the club before his failing hearing forced him to step down. Young later played briefly for Stockport County for 23 games before a knee injury forced his retirement aged 31.\n\nHis full international debut for Scotland came in April 1960, in a 1–1 draw against England attended by 129,193 fans at Hampden Park. By November that year he had six caps, playing alongside an Everton player in each of his last two caps (Jimmy Gabriel and Alex Parker). He moved to Everton before the end of the month of the latter of those two internationals.\n\nYoung played one international game in 1961, a 3–0 win against the Republic of Ireland, scoring twice. He didn't play another full international again for five years, including his championship winning season at Everton. Young was recalled to the national squad in summer 1966, after his FA Cup win. He was capped a total of eight times by Scotland, scoring five goals. He also scored 2 goals in 2 appearances for the Scottish League.\n\nAfter football Young ran his family's business wholesaling soft furnishings in Edinburgh before retiring. His son, Jason, became a professional footballer in the 1990s but could not match his famous father's prowess, and spent his career mostly in the Scottish lower divisions. Young was included in the Football League's \"100 Legends of the 20th Century\" in 1999, and in August 2001 Everton gave him a testimonial at Goodison Park, which over 20,000 fans attended. He was also named as a member of Gwladys Street's Hall of Fame.\n\nYoung married Nancy in 1957, and had three children: Jane, Alex Jnr and Jason. Young died at the age of 80 on 27 February 2017 after a short illness. He is survived by wife Nancy, and their three children.\n\nKen Loach's 1968 docu-drama, \"The Golden Vision\", concerned a group of Everton fans and was named after Young, who also appears on-screen.\n\n\n\nYoung was named as one of the Football League 100 Legends of the 20th Century in May 1999.\n\n"}

The Nez Perce fought a delaying action against the 7th Infantry Regiment (United States) here on August 9 and 10, 1877, during their failed attempt to escape to Canada. This action, the Battle of the Big Hole, was the largest battle fought between the Nez Perce and U.S. Government forces in the five-month conflict known as the Nez Perce War. In 1992 the park was made a part of Nez Perce National Historical Park, which consists of 38 separate locations in five different states, following the flight of the Nez Perce tribe from the U.S. Cavalry.\n\nBig Hole National Battlefield is located on (including privately held), west of Wisdom, Montana on Montana state highway 43. A year-round visitor center is located in the park.\n\nThe Nez Perce homeland territory was in the states now known as Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In 1873, Chief Joseph negotiated with the federal government to ensure his people could stay on their land in the Wallowa Valley as stipulated in 1855 and 1863 land treaties with the U.S. government. By 1860 more than 15,000 miners had broken the treaty terms, and the government did nothing to intervene. In 1877 President Grant signed an Executive order granting the Wallowa to the Nez Perce, only to rescind it two years later. As a result, more whites overran the land, and killed Nez Perce men and raped women. Two farmers also killed a warrior wrongly accused of stealing a horse. Warriors then engaged with settlers, until Joseph, who was 36 years of age, decided it best to not continue to engage, as he was a peace-loving person. Fearing U.S. Army retaliation, Chief Joseph decided that the best way to avoid the official U.S. Government policy of forcing Native Americans onto reservations was to escape to Canada, where he believed that his people would be treated differently and they could unite with Sitting Bull, leader of a band of Lakota there.\n\nAt White Bird canyon, Major General Howard, who outnumbered the Nez Perce two to one, was defeated, after firing on the Nez Perce who came to parley under a white flag. 34 soldiers were killed but only 2 warriors were. The Nez Perce who were now part of the group moving to Canada, numbered around 750, with only 200 warriors. Six weeks after leaving their homeland, U.S. Army forces performed a predawn attack on the 50 men, and 750 women and children encamped at Big Hole. The Nez Perce mounted a fierce resistance and managed to overwhelm the attacking force, cornering them on a hillside. Meanwhile, the women and children fled the battlefield after burying their dead. During the day and a half battle, the Nez Perce lost an estimated 60 to 90 men, women and children, although it is believed that actual losses may have been much higher with a good portion being women and children. U.S. forces lost 28 and an additional 40 serious casualties. The confrontation was the most violent battle between the Nez Perce and the U.S. Government forces. After the battle the Nez Perce fled east through Yellowstone National Park, then headed north. In October 1877, only from the Canada–US border in Montana's Bear Paw Mountains, the starving and exhausted Nez Percé surrendered to the U.S. Forces commanded by General Oliver O. Howard, only after Howard and Miles said they would be allowed to return to their beloved Wallowas. It was a lie. Approximately 150 Nez Perce warriors escaped to Canada prior to the surrender, leaving about 450 women, children and elderly. Upon the final surrender by Chief Joseph he was quoted as saying, \"Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever\". The actual speech was much longer.\nThe Nez Perce were removed to the Colville Reservation in Washington state, and Chief Joseph was never allowed to return to his Wallowas until 1900, when he was \"allowed\" to see his father's grave. The Nez Perce were tall, handsome people, who farmed before the settlers arrived.\n\nThe site was established as a Military Preserve in 1883, and designated a National Monument on June 23, 1910. It was redesignated a National Battlefield on May 17, 1963. The trail system was designated as a National Recreation Trail in 1977. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\n\n\n"}

The site is about southeast of Denver and about east of Pueblo. A few basic park facilities have been opened at this site.\n\nIn 1999, archaeological teams from the National Park Service, Dept. of the Interior BLM, Colorado Historical Society and accompanied by Native American observers, made a major archaeological discovery of remains of the massacre site. Large numbers of period bullets, camp equipment, and other items convinced the NPS that they had found the correct site. Subsequent transfers of ownership from the Dawson family, former owners of the property have left the title of the site to the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes with management to be undertaken by NPS. The National Park Service offers scheduled Ranger-led programs without charge during hours of operation, from 9 am – 4 pm, April 1 – December 1, or by advance appointment in the winter season.\n\nThe Historical Site was authorized by Public Law 106-465 on November 7, 2000, in order to \"recognize the national significance of the massacre in American history, and its ongoing significance to the Cheyenne and Arapaho people and the descendants of the massacre victims.\" The law authorized establishment of the site once the National Park Service acquired sufficient land from willing sellers to preserve, commemorate, and interpret the massacre. The site near the junction of County Road 54 and County Road \"W\" was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 2001. On August 2, 2005, President George W. Bush gave final approval for the site. On April 23, 2007 it was announced that site would become America's 391st official park unit with an effective date of April 27, 2007. The dedication ceremony was held on April 28, 2007.\n\nCurrently the Site encompasses of which are federally owned. By 2004 the federal government acquired from private land owners. On September 9, 2006 the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma conveyed to the United States title to to be held in trust for the National Historic Site. The site includes 640 acres acquired and preserved by the American Battlefield Trust and its partners.\n\nThe site contains a small visitor's center, interpretive plaques and signage, monuments located on a hilltop overlooking the massacre site, and two walking trails. The massacre site itself is off-limits to visitors.\n\n"}

These outposts were established by Catholic religious orders to spread Christianity among the local natives. These missions formed part of a colonization system that stretched across the Spanish Southwest in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.\n\nIn geographic order from north (upstream of the San Antonio River) to south (downstream) the missions are located as follows: Mission Concepción, Mission San Jose, Mission San Juan, and Mission Espada. The Espada Aqueduct, also part of the Park, is due east of Mission San Juan, across the river.\n\nThe fifth (and best known) mission in San Antonio, the Alamo, is not part of the Park. It is located upstream from Mission Concepción, in downtown San Antonio, and is owned by the State of Texas. The Alamo was operated by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas until July 2015, when custodianship was turned over to the Texas General Land Office.\n\nOn July 5, 2015, the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, along with the Alamo Mission in San Antonio, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nIn October 2013, the Mission Reach Ecosystem Restoration and Recreation project was completed, adding 15 miles of hiking, biking, and paddling trails to the San Antonio Missions. This project connects Mission Concepcion, Mission San Jose, Mission San Juan, and Mission Espada to the San Antonio Riverwalk, through a series of park portals. Visitors can experience the Missions by walking, bicycling, or using San Antonio's new VIVA Culture bus routes.\n\nThe park was originally established in 1975 as the Mission Parkway on the National Register of Historic Places encompassing 84 separate historical sites along the San Antonio River on the southern side of the city of San Antonio. Within this listing, the National Historical Park was authorized on November 10, 1978. It was established on April 1, 1983, containing many cultural sites along with some natural areas. Portions of the four missions are owned by the Archdiocese of San Antonio and are still run as active parishes.\n\nIn 1905, custodianship for the Alamo was entrusted to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT). In 2010, the office of the Texas Attorney General received a complaint that the DRT had been mismanaging not only the site, but the funds allocated for its management, and an investigation was begun.\n\nAfter two years, the Attorney General's office concluded that the DRT had mismanaged the Alamo, and cited numerous instances of misconduct on the DRT's part, including failing to properly maintain the Alamo in good order and repair, mismanagement of state funds, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, in 2011, a state law was passed, signed by then-governor Rick Perry, to transfer custodianship of the Alamo from the DRT to the Texas General Land Office (GLO). The transfer was officially enacted in 2015. While the DRT initially objected to the Attorney General's report, and even went so far as to file a lawsuit to prevent the transfer, the organization eventually vowed to work with the Texas GLO to preserve the Alamo for generations to come.\n\nIn July 2015, the missions were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nMisión Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña was established in 1716 as Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de los Hainais in East Texas. The mission was moved in 1731 to San Antonio. Founded by Franciscan friars, this is the best preserved of the Texas missions. Located at 807 Mission Road, Mission Concepcion was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970.\n\nIn 2002, Archbishop Patrick Flores appointed Father Jim Rutkowski the archdiocesan administrator of Mission Concepcion. As such, Fr. Rutkowski has been charged with the pastoral duties associated with the operation of the active church congregation. In 2009-10 Las Misiones Foundation began an active, aggressive campaign to restore the interior of the Mission. Restoration of the mission's interior was completed in March 2010 after six months of work. Fr. Rutkowski continues to offer Sunday Mass regularly for the Mission community.\n\nMisión San José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established in 1720. Located at 6519 San Jose Drive, it was designated the San Jose Mission National Historic Site in 1941. The historic site was administratively listed on the National Register on October 15, 1966. The church, which is still standing, was constructed in 1768. Mission San Jose was founded by Father Antonio Margil.\n\nThe park's visitor center is located adjacent.\n\nMisión San Juan Capistrano was established in 1716 as Misión San Jose de los Nazonis in East Texas. The mission was renamed and moved in 1731 to San Antonio. Located on Mission Road, San Juan was listed on the National Register on February 23, 1972.\n\nMisión San Francisco de la Espada was established in 1690 as San Francisco de los Tejas near present-day Augusta. and renamed San Francisco de los Neches in 1721. The mission was moved in 1731 to San Antonio and given its current name. Located on Espada Road, this mission was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972.\n\nThe Park includes two other locations listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2039914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039914", "title": "United Wa State Army", "text": "United Wa State Army\n\nThe United Wa State Army (; , ), abbreviated as the UWSA or the UWS Army, is the military wing of the United Wa State Party (UWSP), the \"de facto\" ruling party of Wa State (officially known as the Wa Self-Administered Division). It is an ethnic minority army of an estimated 20,000–25,000 Wa soldiers, led by Bao Youxiang. The UWSA was formed after the collapse of the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in 1989.\n\nThe UWSA announced its territory as the \"Wa State Government Special Administrative Region\" on 1 January 2009. The \"de facto\" President is Bao Youxiang, and the Vice President is Xiao Minliang. Although the Government of Myanmar does not officially recognise the sovereignty of Wa State, the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) has frequently allied with the UWSA to fight against Shan nationalist militia groups, such as the Shan State Army - South.\n\nDespite being \"de facto\" independent from Myanmar, the Wa State officially recognizes Myanmar's sovereignty over all of its territory. In 1989 the two parties signed a ceasefire agreement, and in 2013 signed a peace deal.\n\nOn 17 April 1989, ethnic Wa soldiers established the United Wa State Army and ended the long-running Communist insurgency in Burma. On 9 May 1989, the Burmese government signed a cease-fire agreement with UWSA, formally ending the conflict.\n\nThe United Wa State Army was founded and led by Chao Ngi Lai (1939–2009) and later Bao Youxiang. It is an organisation strongly supported by China, which gives it more support than to the Myanmar government. The group's Deputy Commander-in-Chief is Zhao Zhongdang. Aung Myint is the spokesperson. Co-founder was Xuexian Ai. He formed the Wa National Council (WNC) with Hsang Maha Ngeun Wiang, his brother-in-law, in 1984. His group was the nucleus of UWSA 171 Military Region near the Thai border. He died at the age of 78 in Mandalay on 29 October 2011. Ta Maha Hsang sponsored the famous Panglong Agreement\" song composed by Sai Kham Leik and song by Sai Hsai Mao. Wa Supreme Court Chief is Li Zhao Guo. Deputy Chief of External Relationship Department is Sun Khun.\n\nUntil 1996 the United Wa State Army was involved in a conflict against the Shan Mong Tai Army led by drug kingpin Khun Sa which suited the objectives of the Tatmadaw in the area. During this conflict the Wa army occupied areas close to the Thai border, ending up with the control of two separate swathes of territory north and south of Kengtung.\nUWSA is one of the 17 armed ceased fire groups that attended long National Convention orchestrated by Myanmar military.\n\nIn August 2009, the United Wa State Army became involved in the Kokang incident, a violent conflict with Burma's military junta's Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw). This was the largest outbreak of fighting between ethnic armies and government troops since the signing of the cease-fire 20 years earlier.\n\nThe United Wa State Army also works with the ULFA-ATF, an Assam resistant group based in Myanmar.\n\nThe cease-fire agreement allowed the United Wa State Army to freely expand their logistical operations with the Burmese military, including the trafficking of drugs to neighbouring Thailand and Laos.\n\nIn August 1990, government officials began drafting a plan to end drug production and trafficking in Wa State. According to an interview with Wa officials in 1994, Bao Youyi (Tax Kuad Rang; also known as Bao Youyu) became wanted by the Chinese police for his involvement in drug trafficking. As a result, Bao Youxiang and Zhao Nyi-Lai went to Cangyuan Va Autonomous County of China and signed the Cangyuan Agreement with local officials, which stated that, \"No drugs will go into the international society (from Wa State); no drugs will go into China (from Wa State); no drugs will go into Burmese government-controlled areas (from Wa State).\" However, the agreement did not mention whether or not Wa State could sell drugs to insurgent groups.\n\nIn 1997, the United Wa State Party officially proclaimed that Wa State would be drug-free by the end of 2005. With the help of the United Nations and the Chinese government, many opium farmers in Wa State shifted to the production of rubber and tea. However, some poppy farmers continued to cultivate the flower outside of Wa State.\n\nThe United States government Drug Enforcement Administration labelled the UWSA as a narcotic trafficking organisation on 29 May 2003. On 3 November 2005, The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control listed 11 individuals and 16 companies that were \"part of the financial and commercial network of designated significant foreign narcotics trafficker Wei Hsueh-kang and the United Wa State Army (UWSA).\" The UWSA is said to be the largest drug-producing organisation in Southeast Asia. The UWSP on its part blamed both the Ne Win military government and the CPB for using the Wa as \"pawns in the violent destructive games\" and encouraging them to grow the opium poppy.\n\nThe opium poppy harvest had increased since the former drug baron and warlord Lo Hsing Han managed to rebuild his drug empire after he became the intermediary for cease-fire agreements between the military intelligence chief Khin Nyunt and the Kokang and Wa insurgents who had rebelled against and toppled the Communist leadership in 1989. In addition to the traditional Golden Triangle export of opiates, production has diversified to methamphetamine, or \"yaa baa\", which is cheaper and easier to manufacture than heroin. Thai authorities have denounced methamphetamine production, trafficking, and consumption as a threat to national security. It denied involvement in the Mekong incident of 5 November 2011.\n\nIn recent years, poppy cultivation has declined in both northern Laos and the Wa region partly as a result of a ban imposed by the UWSP in 2005. In 1999, Bao Youxiang ordered a forced relocation, away from the poppy fields, of six northern Wa districts south to mainly Shan and Lahu areas. The World Food Program (WFP) and China also provided emergency food assistance to former poppy farmers. Chinese criminal organisations in the area however may have simply switched the production line from heroin to amphetamine -type stimulants (ATS) such as \"yaa baa\".\n\nWei Hsueh-kang founded the Hong Pang Group in 1998 with revenues from the drug trade after taking advantage of the privileges offered in the cease-fire deal by Khin Nyunt. Its position in the country's economy, not just the Wa State, is reflected by the multitude of businesses it owns and controls in construction, agriculture, gems and minerals, petroleum, electronics and communications, distilleries and department stores. Hong Pang Group is based at Pangkham with offices also in Yangon, Mandalay, Lashio, Tachilek and Mawlamyine and minor bases in Sankang and Khailong. UWSA also operated its own bank in the past.\n\nHo Chun Ting (also known as Aik Haw and Hsiao Haw), the son-in-law of Bao Youxiang, is the principal owner and managing director of Yangon Airways and chairman of Tetkham Co Ltd that runs a chain of hotels. Close to Khin Nyunt and several other generals in the junta, he was also involved in gems auctions and several large construction projects with the Yangon City Development Council. He was reported to have fled to Pangkham following the arrest of his known associates in a drug-related offence in January 2009. Aik Haw was included in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list published by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on 25 November 2008.\n\nFormer Thai Premier Thaksin Shinawatra and the Thai military have a long-standing business relationship with the UWSA.\n\nThe United Wa State Army (UWSA) has five \"divisions\" deployed along the Thai-Burma border:\n\nOn the China-Burma border are stationed another three \"divisions\":\n\nThe United Wa State Army has 30,000 active service men with a 10,000 strong auxiliary force. It is one of the largest cease fire groups. Monthly salary is only 60 CNY (US$7.5). UWSA had clashes with the Thai Army in Mar–May 2002.\n\nAccording to \"Jane's Intelligence Review\" in April 2008, China has become the main source of arms to the United Wa State Army, displacing traditional black market sources in South East Asia such as Thailand and Cambodia. A \"Jane\"'s report in December 2008 stated that the UWSA had turned to arms production to supplement their income from arms and drug trafficking, and started a small arms production line for AK 47s.\n\nJane's reported in 2001 that the UWSA had acquired HN-5N Surface-to-air missile (SAMs) from China as part of the build-up near the Thai border where they were reported to be operating 40–50 laboratories manufacturing \"yaa baa\". In November 2014, Janes further reported that the UWSA have acquired the FN-6 Surface-to-air missile to supplant the HN-5N in service, which was promptly denied by the UWSA. It is also the middleman between Chinese arms manufacturers and other insurgent groups in Myanmar. By 2012, Chinese support had increased to the point of supplying armoured vehicles such as the 6 × 6 PTL-02 assault gun being sighted in Pangkham.\n\nOn 29 April 2013, Janes IHS reported that several Mil Mi-17 helicopters armed with TY-90 air-to-air missiles were supplied to UWSA by China. The allegations were dismissed by China, Thai military sources, other Myanmar ethnic sources and the UWSA themselves. In 2015 IHS Jane's reported that UWSA members had been photographed training with Chinese Type 96 122 mm howitzers and HJ-8 ATGMs.\n\nThe towns of Pangkham and Mong Pawk are within the area of this special region. The UWSA negotiated a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese military in the 1990s, and currently backs a counterinsurgency strategy of the Myanmar Army against the Shan State Army-South (SSA-S). The UWSA defied the military regime's recent demand to disarm and participate in the 2010 elections, and instead proposed to declare the territory under their control as a special autonomous region.\n\nAccording to 2008 constitution, six townships are designated as the Wa Self-Administered Division. Those are Mongmao, Pangwaun, Namphan, Pangkham (Pangsang), Hopang and Matman Township. Although Mong Pawk is not part of it, but part of Mong Yang Township, the UWSA was strongly against to give away that area from its control because it serves as a link with its ally, the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) in Mongla. Hopang and Matman are not under UWSA control. UWSA announced its territory as Wa State Government Special Administrative Region in January 2009.\n\nThe UWSA is a plot element in the American police procedural TV series \"\", Season 8, Episode 17, \"Sin\".\n\n\n"}

The game relies heavily on video footage, with which the player interacts. It contains 110 minutes of interactive footage from four different cameras. It was directed by Dwight H. Little, who is also known for the films \"Marked for Death\" and \"\".\n\nAliens known as Reticulans have attacked El Cadron, a small border town in Texas. The player has arrived to save the townspeople, who have been disappearing. The aliens have clever ways of disguising themselves as townspeople. The player's mission is to do away with the Reticulans, but they cannot be killed with regular guns. The player is armed with four BattleCams, with a stunning particle beam that stops the alien temporarily. The player must rid the world of the Reticulan menace before the entire area is destroyed by a nuclear bomb.\n\nFour special operatives will help the player by providing clues to the Reticulan base. When a special operative is fighting with a Reticulan, the player has to shoot the enemy before they can abduct the special operative. After the enemy is disposed of, the special operative can look at its pendant. On each pendant is a number and a shape that corresponds to a special lock. Once the code is cracked, the vaulted door opens to reveal the Reticulans' weapons arsenal and a cold storage area.\n\nAfter the base is secured, all of the player's BattleCams become reprogrammed with Reticulan weaponry. Upon learning of this development, the Reticulans deploy stormtroopers to destroy the town and its people. The Special Forces fight back as the areas of the town explode into debris.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to stop the Special Forces, the Reticulans abduct Reece, take him to their mothership, and prepare to take off. DiSalvo rigs a special BattleCam armed with a giant alien cannon. With a single well-placed shot, the mothership is obliterated, saving the town and Earth from the Reticulan army.\n\n\"Ground Zero Texas\" was a \"second-generation\" title for Digital Pictures, their first titles for the Sega CD having been rehashes of titles developed for Hasbro's aborted NEMO system. The game had a two million dollar budget - most of which was generated by the bundling of \"Sewer Shark\" with Sega CD consoles.\n\nThe game started life with the codename Project X, a script written by Digital Pictures co-founder Ken Melville that was inspired by \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and \"Invaders from Mars\". By the time development started, the script had been re-written by Alan B. McElroy, Edward Neumeier and Joshua Stallings.\n\nThe game's FMV was shot by a full Hollywood film crew, which meant that Digital Pictures had to negotiate with the Directors Guild, Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild - the first time this had been done for a video game.\n\nIn the game, the film elements suffered due to the technical limitations of the Sega CD. The film had to be processed to reduce it to a palette of 64 colours and to accommodate the slow data transfer rate of the CD drive. Despite the limitations, the game's visual appearance was still described as \"breathtaking\" for 1993 by \"Edge\". In a retrospective interview with \"Edge\", Ken Melville of Digital Pictures expressed his displeasure at the technical limitations of the video, \"All our video had to be tortured, kicking and screaming, into the most horrifying, blurry, reduced-colour-palette mess imaginable in the Sega CD. I shudder to think about it\"\n\n\"Ground Zero: Texas\" was a bestseller in the UK for two months, and was awarded Best Sega Mega-CD Game of 1994 by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".

The school board says the word \"Shenendahowe\" comes from an Iroquois word meaning \"Great Plains\".\nIn fact, all of the schools with the exception of the high schools have names derived from the Iroquois language.\n\nAfter construction, kindergarten students and students of grades 8 through 12 were allowed to move into the main building (now Gowana and Acadia) in 1953. The following year, students of grades 1 through 7 would enter the same building. Grades K-6 started moved to Tesago and Skano in 1966, while Grades 9-12 moved to Shenendehowa High School after it was built in 1970. Shenendehowa Central School District continued to expand with High School West (1999), Koda Middle School (1976), and elementary schools Orenda (1968), Karigon (1968), Okte (1973), Chango (1974), Arongen (1992), and Shatekon (2007).\n\nShenendehowa's alma mater, written in 1962, is as follows:Shenendehowa Central out on the plain so clear; Her Carillon bells are standing a symbol we hold dear; And through the years she'll guide us and help us on our way; We never will forget her but with honour will repay; Alma Mater, Alma Mater; to thee we sang our praise; Shenendehowa Central; Our standard our guide always \n\nShenendehowa's athletic teams are called the Plainsmen, and their mascot is the stallion. They participate in 34 varsity sports over all seasons, as well as competing at junior varsity, freshman, and modified levels in many of these sports. Fall Varsity Sports include boys cross country, American football, golf, soccer, and volleyball, as well as girls cross country running, field hockey, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, volleyball, color guard, and cheerleading. In the winter season, the plainsmen compete in boys and girls alpine and cross-country skiing, basketball, bowling club, winter guard, and indoor track, as well as boys wrestling, swimming and diving, and ice hockey, and girls gymnastics and cheerleading. The spring season includes boys and girls track and field and lacrosse, as well as baseball and tennis for boys, and softball for girls.\n\nAlthough not officially associated with Shenendehowa Athletics, Friends of Shenendehowa Crew, Inc. sponsors crew teams at the Modified, Freshmen, and Varsity levels which are open to Shenendehowa students.)\n\n\n"}

Ensembl aims to provide a centralized resource for geneticists, molecular biologists and other researchers studying the genomes of our own species and other vertebrates and model organisms. Ensembl is one of several well known genome browsers for the retrieval of genomic information.\n\nSimilar databases and browsers are found at NCBI and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).\n\nThe human genome consists of three billion base pairs, which code for approximately 20,000–25,000 genes. However the genome alone is of little use, unless the locations and relationships of individual genes can be identified. One option is manual annotation, whereby a team of scientists tries to locate genes using experimental data from scientific journals and public databases. However this is a slow, painstaking task. The alternative, known as automated annotation, is to use the power of computers to do the complex pattern-matching of protein to DNA.\n\nIn the Ensembl project, sequence data are fed into the gene annotation system (a collection of software \"pipelines\" written in Perl) which creates a set of predicted gene locations and saves them in a MySQL database for subsequent analysis and display. Ensembl makes these data freely accessible to the world research community. All the data and code produced by the Ensembl project is available to download, and there is also a publicly accessible database server allowing remote access. In addition, the Ensembl website provides computer-generated visual displays of much of the data.\n\nOver time the project has expanded to include additional species (including key model organisms such as mouse, fruitfly and zebrafish) as well as a wider range of genomic data, including genetic variations and regulatory features. Since April 2009, a sister project, Ensembl Genomes, has extended the scope of Ensembl into invertebrate metazoa, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protists, whilst the original project continues to focus on vertebrates.\n\nCentral to the Ensembl concept is the ability to automatically generate graphical views of the alignment of genes and other genomic data against a reference genome. These are shown as data tracks, and individual tracks can be turned on and off, allowing the user to customise the display to suit their research interests. The interface also enables the user to zoom in to a region or move along the genome in either direction.\n\nOther displays show data at varying levels of resolution, from whole karyotypes down to text-based representations of DNA and amino acid sequences, or present other types of display such as trees of similar genes (homologues) across a range of species. The graphics are complemented by tabular displays, and in many cases data can be exported directly from the page in a variety of standard file formats such as FASTA.\n\nExternally produced data can also be added to the display, either via a DAS (Distributed Annotation System) server on the internet, or by uploading a suitable file in one of the supported formats, such as BAM, BED, or PSL.\n\nGraphics are generated using a suite of custom Perl modules based on GD, the standard Perl graphics display library.\n\nIn addition to its website, Ensembl provides a Perl API (Application Programming Interface) that models biological objects such as genes and proteins, allowing simple scripts to be written to retrieve data of interest. The same API is used internally by the web interface to display the data. It is divided in sections like the core API, the compara API (for comparative genomics data), the variation API (for accessing SNPs, SNVs, CNVs..), and the functional genomics API (to access regulatory data). \nThe Ensembl website provides extensive information on how to install and use the API.\n\nThis software can be used to access the public MySQL database, avoiding the need to download enormous datasets. The users could even choose to retrieve data from the MySQL with direct SQL queries, but this requires an extensive knowledge of the current database schema.\n\nLarge datasets can be retrieved using the BioMart data-mining tool. It provides a web interface for downloading datasets using complex queries.\n\nLast, there is an FTP server which can be used to download entire MySQL databases as well some selected data sets in other formats.\n\nThe annotated genomes include most fully sequenced vertebrates and selected model organisms. All of them are eukaryotes, there are no prokaryotes. , this includes:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2039933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039933", "title": "Washington, My Home", "text": "Washington, My Home\n\n\"Washington, My Home\" (sometimes stylized \"Washington My Home\") is the state song of Washington, in the United States. It was composed in 1951 by Helen Davis and set to music by Stuart Churchill under the name \"America, My Home\". Subsequently, retitled and rewritten as \"Washington, My Home\", it was made the state song in 1959 by an act of the Washington State Legislature. An earlier anthem, \"Washington Beloved\", was declared the state song in 1909 by a ceremonial resolution of the state legislature.\n\n\"Washington Beloved\" was written by Edmond Meany for the University of Washington's 1906 songbook. Penned in four verses, the melody was composed by Reginald De Koven who agreed to set Meany's words to music for $100, which was paid by the Associated Students of the University of Washington. It was debuted by the University of Washington Glee Club on December 13, 1907. The following month, \"Washington Beloved\" was also performed during dedication ceremonies of Lorado Taft's statue of George Washington at the University of Washington campus in Seattle, following orations by Meany and French ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand.\n\nWhile Meany did not intend for \"Washington Beloved\" to be anything more than a collegiate song, a movement started to establish it as the state anthem, the lyrics being equally suitable for such use and the composer – de Koven – sufficiently prominent.\n\n\"Washington Beloved\" was declared the Washington state anthem on March 11, 1909, by concurrent resolution of the two chambers of the Washington state legislature sitting in joint session, the act signed by Governor Marion E. Hay on March 18 of that year. Ten members of the legislature, all from Eastern Washington, abstained from voting on the resolution due to the song's lyrics which referred to \"purple banners\", purple being one of the school colors of the University of Washington, rival to the eastern-situated Washington State College. Concurrent resolutions in joint session are only ceremonial expressions of the will of the legislature so the establishment of \"Washington Beloved\" was not codified as state law.\n\nIn 1935, the Washington Emergency Relief Administration printed and distributed copies of \"Washington Beloved\" to all of the state's children. Despite these and other efforts, however, the song fell into disuse.\n\nPrior to World War II, the Theodore Presser Company obtained distribution rights to \"Washington Beloved\" from the John Church Company and renamed it \"Loyal and True\" with the intent of licensing it as a generic school song for use by universities, though it did not gain popularity in this incarnation either.\n\n\"Washington, My Home\" was written by Helen Davis of South Bend, Washington and arranged by Stuart Churchill as \"America, My Home\" for the Pacific County Centennial Pageant of 1951. The following year, Davis rewrote the lyrics and retitled the song \"Washington, My Home\" to enter into the 1953 Washington centennial song competition, commemorating the establishment and independence of Washington Territory from Oregon Territory in 1853.\n\nIn 1959, \"Washington, My Home\" was declared the state song in an 89–5 vote of the Washington House of Representatives and a unanimous vote of the state senate, the act thereafter promulgated by Governor Albert Rosellini. Rosellini signed the legislation establishing the song as the anthem in the governor's office in Olympia on March 19, 1959, with Davis present at the signing. Others present as witnesses included Frederick Cohn, the former president of the Washington Federation of Music Clubs; Dale Nordquist, a member of the state senate from Centralia; and Joe Chytil, a member of the state house from Chehalis.\n\nIn 1985, television host Ross Shafer began a campaign to replace \"Washington, My Home\" as the state song with \"Louie, Louie\", on the basis that the latter song was popularized by Tacoma, Washington resident Rockin' Robin Roberts two years prior to it achieving national acclaim as a rock standard. After several county governments enacted resolutions supporting the campaign, a rally was held on the steps of the Washington State Capitol featuring The Fabulous Wailers, The Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, who performed a 30-minute version of the tune. The growing seriousness of the campaign, however, prompted a backlash from members of the legislature; the \"Washington Post\" reported, at the time, that two factions developed among lawmakers, one determined to preserve \"Washington, My Home\" and the other agitating for its replacement with Woody Guthrie's \"Roll On, Columbia, Roll On\". The latter faction secured Guthrie's son, Arlo, to fly to Washington and perform \"Roll On, Columbia, Roll On\" at the Capitol. Meanwhile, residents of Idaho and Oregon began protesting the proposed adoption of \"Louie, Louie\" claiming that their two states had a better claim on the song than Washington while the aging Helen Davis also expressed ire at the potential abandonment of her work.\n\nIn a floor debate, Representative Bob Basich of Aberdeen, Washington denounced the move to adopt \"Louie, Louie\", saying it would be like \"making marijuana our state plant\". As a compromise, the legislature ultimately preserved \"Washington, My Home\" as the state song, while also adopting \"Louie, Louie\" as the state rock anthem and \"Roll On, Columbia, Roll On\" as the official folk song.\n\nIn 2011, papers were filed to place a referendum on the general election ballot to change the state song from \"Washington, My Home\" to the Seattle SuperSonics fight song – \"Not In Our House\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot – until such time as an NBA franchise was reassigned to Seattle at which time the song would have reverted to \"Washington, My Home\". The sponsor of the effort, Kris Brannon, said he undertook the attempt to raise awareness of the Sonics' then-imminent departure for Oklahoma City. The proposal would have required a petition signed by 241,153 registered voters to qualify for inclusion on the election ballot; no signatures were submitted by the deadline.\n\nFollowing the designation of \"Washington, My Home\" as state song, Harry Bauer – the former director of libraries at the University of Washington – opined that:\n\nJohn F. Kennedy once praised the lyrics of \"Washington, My Home\" and suggested its line \"for you and me, a destiny\" replace the state's commonly accepted, though unofficial, motto \"Alki\", the latter a word in the local creole Chinook Jargon roughly meaning \"by and by\", \"eventually\", or \"future\".\n\nSection 1.20.070 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) sets forth that:\n\nSection 1.20.071 of the RCW goes on to provide that:\n\nIn August 1959, Davis assigned the copyright of the song to the State of Washington.\n\n\n"}

She is known as a member of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child, with which she won two Grammy Awards and released many successful commercial recordings. Luckett has sold over 25 million records with Destiny's Child on the group's first two albums and singles.\n\nShe began her solo career after signing a record deal with Capitol Records. Her solo debut album, \"LeToya\" (2006), topped the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart in July 2006, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in December 2006. The single, \"Torn\", achieved records on BET's top ten countdown show \"106 & Park.\" She was also named \"One of the Best New Artists of 2006\" by AOL and the \"Top Songwriter of 2006\" by ASCAP.\nLuckett released a second solo album, \"Lady Love\" on August 25, 2009, which debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and also as No. 12 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nLuckett has since become an actress. She was the star of the movie \"Preacher's Kid.\" She's part of the cast of the feature films \"Killers\" and \"From the Rough\" and had a recurring role on the second season of the HBO TV series \"Treme\", and on the third season of the VH1 TV series \"Single Ladies\". She currently has a recurring role in the OWN series \"Greenleaf\".\n\nOn May 12, 2017, Luckett released her third studio album, \"Back 2 Life\", which debuted at number 91 on the \"Billboard\" 200, marking her lowest charting album in the United States to date. The album was preceded by two singles—\"Back 2 Life\" and \"Used To\".\n\nLuckett was born on March 11, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She grew up singing in her local Brentwood Baptist Church. She also took vocal lessons to become an opera singer. Her father, who was also a singer, was very proud of his daughter's vocal talents and tried to get her in the music business. Luckett is the older of two children. Luckett was given the chance to sing her first solo at the age of five. \"The lady just gave me the mic one Sunday and I sang,\" she recalled. Shortly thereafter, she joined the children's choir and began performing in plays at her elementary school. One day, she walked to her desk in class to find a girl sitting in her seat. Luckett asked her teacher to remove the girl (who turned out to be Beyoncé Knowles) from her assigned seat. They later became friends and she was invited to join Beyoncé's singing group Girls Tyme, which later became Destiny's Child.\n\nIn 1993, LeToya Luckett joined Knowles, LaTavia Roberson, and Kelly Rowland to complete the Houston-based R&B group, Destiny's Child. The roles of the group consisted with Knowles as lead vocalist, Rowland as second-lead vocalist plus alongside Roberson and Luckett as background vocalists with Roberson as alto (and spokesperson) adding the low notes and Luckett as the soprano adding the high notes to the group's harmony, however occasional leads too. After being signed and later dropped by Elektra Records, the group eventually signed with Columbia Records in 1997, but not before signing with Mathew Knowles the group's manager (and also Beyoncé Knowles' father). According to the E! Television Special, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Knowles forced the girls to sign with him before they could sign with the label. Luckett's mother requested the contracts be reviewed by an attorney, but Knowles denied the request. However, Luckett eventually signed with him and joined the group. After graduating from the Houston club scene, the group opened for established acts such as Dru Hill, SWV, and Immature, and released their 1998 self-titled debut album \"Destiny's Child\". The album spawned two singles: the platinum \"No, No, No Part II\" (featuring Wyclef Jean) and \"With Me\". Subsequently, the group made it on the soundtrack album of the romantic comedy \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" with the song \"Get on the Bus\" (featuring Timbaland), and later toured as an opening act on TLC's \"Fanmail Tour\" and Christina Aguilera's debut tour.\n\nIn 1999, the group released their second album, \"The Writing's on the Wall.\" The album became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group, and was certified eight times platinum in the USA. As opposed to the first album, Luckett had more contribution to the second album in terms of co-writing. The album spawned four hit singles: \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Bug a Boo\", \"Say My Name\", and \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\". The two singles \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name\" were also nominated for Grammy awards, which \"Say My Name\" won in two different categories. The album had also been released in a \"Houston Special Edition\" which included a bonus track where Luckett sung lead in alongside all other members entitled \"Can't Help Myself\".\n\nIn late 1999, in the midst of the group's success and rise, Luckett and Roberson asserted that they wanted their own manager because of the increasing lack of communication with manager Mathew Knowles. The pair said they never wanted to fire Knowles, but wanted to secure outside management to represent them. Soon after, Luckett and Roberson found themselves ostracized by the Knowles family and the group's management. When the music video for \"Say My Name\" debuted in February 2000, they were replaced by two new members, Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland, charging them with breach of partnership and fiduciary duties, and sought unspecified damages. Luckett and Roberson withdrew the case against Beyoncé and Kelly, but continued to sue Mathew Knowles. The case was eventually settled, with Luckett and Roberson receiving royalties for their contributions as founding members of the group. Shortly following the release of Destiny's Child's \"Survivor\", Luckett and Roberson filed another lawsuit against the group in March 2002. They claimed that the album's lead single, \"Survivor\", violated their previous settlement due to its lyrics.\n\nAfter several months of media speculation, it was announced via the MTV News website that Luckett and Roberson had created a new group called Anjel. After several auditions, Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin were selected as members. The group recorded a 22-song demo in Atlanta, Georgia, with the help of R&B group Jagged Edge. The group also appeared in Jagged Edge's video for \"Where the Party At (Remix)\". However, the production company (581 Entertainment) which handled the group collapsed and all the members of Anjel went on to pursue solo projects. Meanwhile, the recorded tracks were leaked onto the Internet.\n\nAfter the Anjel project fell through, Luckett joined with Noontime, an Atlanta-based management/production company. Along with Noontime, she recorded a five-song demo and eventually signed with Capitol Records in 2003. Soon after, she began working on her debut solo album. The first promotional song, \"You Got What I Need\", was released in 2004, followed next year by \"All Eyes on Me\". She was featured on \"My Promise\" with her label mate Houston on his debut album \"It's Already Written,\" \"What Love Can Do\" on the \"Coach Carter\" soundtrack, and on \"This Is My Life\" with former boyfriend and rapper Slim Thug on his album \"Already Platinum.\" LeToya's self-titled debut album was released in July 2006 and debuted at number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. \"LeToya\" was certified gold after one month and by December 2006, the album had been certified platinum. Luckett and Beyoncé Knowles are the only members of Destiny's Child to have an album debut at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and achieve platinum status in the U.S.\n\nThe album is a hip-hop inspired R&B production. Producers included Jermaine Dupri, Scott Storch, Teddy Bishop, B. Cox, and musical guests Slim Thug, Mike Jones, Paul Wall, and Bun B. \"All Eyes on Me\" was originally chosen as Luckett's debut single, but \"Torn\" was ultimately selected instead. The ballad (produced by Teddy Bishop) was released March 2006 and became an R&B hit. The song climbed the \"Billboard\" charts, peaking at number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\nAlthough \"Torn\" was still receiving airplay, her second single, \"She Don't\" was released to radio, and the video premiered on BET's \"Access Granted\" in July 2006, featuring Luckett's ex-boyfriend, Slim Thug. The single received moderate success, reaching number 17 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. In November 2006, \"Obvious\" was selected as the third single. According to \"Billboard\", the song had a 94% chance of becoming a hit, but due to the merger of Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all promotional money was frozen, therefore the single was never officially released. Luckett was also named \"One of the Best New Artists of 2006\" by AOL Music, number two on \"Rap-Up\" magazines' Top 5 Breakthrough Artists of 2006, and received multiple nominations from the NAACP, the Soul Train Music Awards, and the Teen Choice Awards.\nBET promoted Luckett on \"106 & Park,\" \"The Center,\" \"The Black Carpet,\" and with a three-part reality series special called \"The H-Town Chick\" which aired from May to July 2006. The series chronicled Luckett's experiences during her summer promotional tour and insight about her life since Destiny's Child. BET also hosted a contest that gave fans the opportunity to decide the final outcome of the \"Torn\" video. Cingular hosted a lip-sync contest that awarded those who best performed \"Torn\" in an online submitted video. In addition to a nationwide radio tour, club performances, a brief European and Asian appearances, Luckett participated in the 2006 \"Pantene Total You\" Tour, the \"Cingular Live in Concert\" series, and was invited by Mary J. Blige to join her summer tour, \"The Breakthrough Experience Tour,\" as her opening act.\n\nIn July 2009, while opening for a Mary J. Blige concert, Luckett announced that her upcoming album was going to be named \"Lady Love,\" she then introduced and performed two new songs \"Lady Love\" and \"Don't Let Me Get Away\". On December 10 (?), a buzz track, \"Swagger,\" that features rappers such as Slim Thug, Killa Kyleon and Bun B leaked onto the Internet. In 2008, Luckett was featured on Webbie's single \"I Miss You\" which was a moderate success.\n\nLuckett's second solo album was released on August 25, 2009 Production for \"Lady Love\" originally began in 2007, with a release scheduled several times in 2008. However this was postponed due to lack of funding related to the Capitol Records and Virgin Records merger that had earlier affected the release of her third single \"Obvious\". In early 2009, the release date for \"Lady Love\" was announced to be May 19, 2009, then pushed to June 16, and finally set to August 24, 2009. Amidst much anticipation for the album release, Luckett released a five-track sampler on May 19, 2009. The sampler features first single \"Not Anymore\" and 1 minute 30-second snippets of \"Regret\", \"She Ain't Got...\", \"Lady Love\" and \"Matter\". The album was released to CD and music download on August 25, 2009, in the US and worldwide a day earlier. An explicit version of the album (bearing a Parental Advisory label) was also made available. To celebrate the album's release, LeToya hosted an album-release party at Cain in New York City on August 27, 2009.\n\"Not Anymore\", the lead single, was produced by Bei Maejor and co-produced and written by Ne-Yo. Released in February 2009, it became the most added song at urban radio, debuting at number ninety-eight on the US \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart before peaking at number eighteen and just missing the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, peaking at number 107. A music video for the single was shot on February 13, 2009. Directed by Bryan Barber, the music video is set in the 1960s and is split into 3 sections/time periods – 1961, 1964 and 1968. The sets, costumes and props change accordingly in each section to show the trends, fashions and styles of those particular years.\n\nThe video was released on March 10, 2009, and peaked at number three on the 106 & Park video countdown.\n\"She Ain't Got...\" the album's second single, was produced by Cory Bold and written by LeToya, Andre Merritt, Chris Brown and Bold. Chosen by fans, it became the first LeToya single to carry a Parental Advisory label, though a \"clean\" version was also released. It became the most added song on rhythmic radio, peaking at number thirty-nine on the \"Billboard\" Rhythmic Top 40 chart, while peaking at number seventy-five on the \"Billboard\" Pop 100 Airplay chart and number twenty on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play. However, the single was most successful in Japan where it peaked at number forty-nine on the Japan Hot 100. A music video, directed by Bryan Barber was shot on June 3, 2009 and premiered on Yahoo Music on June 30, 2009, featuring guest star Major League Baseball players Orlando Hudson and Matt Kemp of the Los Angeles Dodgers as well as Baseball Hall of Fame member Dave Winfield.\n\"Regret\", featuring rapper Ludacris, was produced by Tank and Jerry \"Texx\" Franklin and written by Tank, LeToya, Franklin, K. Stephens, J. Valentine, R. Newt and C. Bridges. Released as the third single – based only on downloads and airplay – \"Regret\" peaked at number eight on the US \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and debuted at number one-hundred on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making it LeToya's first single since her debut; \"Torn\", to enter the US Hot 100, peaking at number seventy-eight. It also peaked at number forty-two on the \"Billboard\" Radio Songs chart and was listed at number six on AOL Music's \"Top R&B Songs of 2009\" list. The music video for \"Regret\" was premiered on BET's \"106 & Park\" on November 11, 2009 before being ranked at number twenty-three on \": Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown\".\n\"Good To Me\", produced by Tank and Jerry \"Texx\" Franklin and written by Tank, Franklin, K. Stephens, R. Newt and J. Valentine, was released as the album's fourth and final single. Though the song failed to chart, a music video directed by makeup artist AJ Crimson and co-starring model-actor Keston Karter was released on February 11, 2010.\n\nIn January 2014, Luckett announced the title of her third studio album on The Wendy Williams Show, \"Until Then\", with a planned 2016 release.\n\nOn February 11, 2014, Luckett released the first promo single Don't Make Me Wait\nfrom the upcoming album \"Until Then\". A remix featuring rapper T.I. was released on March 10, 2015. On January 5, 2015, Luckett released a track \"I'm Ready\" on her YouTube channel. On January 16, 2015, Luckett released \"Together\" inspired to end illegal gun violence in America in recent partnership with the Caliber Foundation.\n\nOn December 7, 2016, she released the single \"Back 2 Life\", with an accompanying music video released on January 10, 2017.\n\nOn April 10, 2017, Luckett posted on her Twitter page that her third studio album will be released on May 12, 2017 with the album title changing from \"Until Then\" to \"Back 2 Life\".\nOn April 17, 2017, a second single from the album named \"Used To\", was released.\n\nLeToya has had two web series of herself on YouTube.

{"id": "2039953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039953", "title": "Hard Rain (film)", "text": "Hard Rain (film)\n\nHard Rain is a 1998 action-thriller disaster film produced by Mark Gordon, written by Graham Yost, and directed by former cinematographer-turned director Mikael Salomon. It stars Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver, and Ed Asner. It is an international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and Japan. The plot centers around a heist and man-made treachery amidst a natural disaster in a small Indiana town.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm armored truck drivers Tom (Christian Slater) and his uncle Charlie (Edward Asner) are collecting money from banks in the town of Huntingburg, Indiana, which has been evacuated due to flooding. They are ambushed by Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of armed robbers, Kenny (Michael Goorjian), Mr. Mehlor (Dann Florek) and Ray (Ricky Harris). Charlie calls the National Guard and is shot dead by Kenny as Tom escapes and hides the cash in a cemetery.\n\nThe gang chases Tom who takes refuge in a nearby church, where he is mistaken for a looter by Karen (Minnie Driver) who knocks him out. He wakes up in a cell, and tells Sheriff Mike Collins (Randy Quaid) about the gang and the money. The Sheriff and Chief Deputy Wayne Bryce (Mark Rolston) leave him locked up and go to investigate, whilst Deputy Phil (Peter Murnik) is ordered to take Karen out of town. Karen pushes Phil out of the boat to return to protect the church, which she is restoring.\n\nThe town's dam operator Hank (Wayne Duvall) is forced to open a spillway floodgate causing a large wave and deeper flooding. Tom is trapped in his cell as the water rises. After protecting the church, Karen rescues him and they hide from the gang. Kenny is electrocuted. They enter a house and are mistaken for looters by the elderly residents Doreen (Betty White) and Henry Sears (Richard Dysart) who have declined to evacuate and are determined to protect their property. Henry is persuaded to give Tom their boat to return to the armored truck. Resurfacing from the submerged truck he finds the gang holding the elderly couple hostage. Tom says he will tell where the money is.\n\nJim reveals to Tom that Charlie was in cahoots with the gang, and did not actually call the National Guard. He was only killed because Kenny was not told Charlie was on their side. Tom finds the money has disappeared. They are ambushed by Sheriff Collins and his deputies plus Hank, who have found Karen and intend to keep the money for themselves.\n\nMr. Mehlor and Ray are killed in the shoot out, and Jim and Tom escape and hide in the church. Wayne takes Karen to her house intending to rape her. The others petrol bomb the church and drive their boats through the stained glassed windows. Karen stabs and kills Wayne. Hank shoots Phil for not shooting Tom when he had the chance\n\nThe dam overtop alarm sounds. Collins suggests Tom and Jim should let Hank and him go with a couple of the bags of money. Tom agrees, but Jim does not. Tom leaves to try to save Karen, before Collins shoots Jim with a revolver he was hiding, although Jim isn't badly hurt. Collins and Hank escape in a boat. Hank is pushed out by Collins and is killed in a gas explosion.\n\nTom finds Karen handcuffed to a banister. He frees her and they climb to the roof to avoid the water where they are caught by Collins. Jim comes from behind them in a boat. Collins shoots at him, disabling the steering, forcing him to go over the roof. As he does so, the engine breaks off and collides with the sheriff, knocking him into the water. Collins tries to shoot Karen as he grabs a bag of money, but Tom and Jim shoot the corrupt sheriff dead. Tom tells Jim he should leave, just as the State Police arrive. Jim picks up Collins' bag of money and rows away, as Tom tells Karen the fire damage to her church wasn't too bad and can be repaired.\n\n\nThe production of the film was a collaborative effort between numerous film studios, one of which was the British Broadcasting Corporation. Christian Slater himself served as co-producer. At one point, John Woo was attached to direct the film, but he left the project to direct \"Face/Off\" instead and the project was taken over by Mikael Salomon.\n\nThe film was originally titled \"The Flood\", but it was changed because the film-makers did not want audiences to assume it was primarily a disaster film and not a heist-thriller. However, the film still retained that title in numerous other countries.\n\nThe film was shot in Huntingburg, Indiana, where the film is set (in reality there is no major river or dam nearby, although there are two reservoirs near the town), as well as a $6 million set in an aircraft hangar in Palmdale, California where the B-1 Lancer bomber was manufactured, and some exteriors in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nAs of April 2016, upon speaking with the Huntingburg City Office, film historian Adam Nichols was informed of and shown a museum located upstairs in the city office where several props, costumes, media, and production stills are displayed featuring this film and the 1992 film \"A League of Their Own\" that was also partially filmed in Huntingburg.\n\nAbout the ending, Morgan Freeman said: \"I played a bad guy in a movie and they showed it to an audience - and we're letting an audience tell us what to do now - y'know, and the audience said, 'Well, I don't want him - Morgan can't die!' And I was a thief. 'He should get some money'. We went back into the studio and re-shot it so that I didn't die and I did get some money.\"\n\nThe film features the song \"Flood\" by the Christian rock group Jars of Clay, which launched the band into the mainstream music scene.\n\n\"Hard Rain\" opened on Martin Luther King long weekend in 1998 earning fifth place with $7.1 million from Friday to Sunday and $8 million including the holiday Monday. In the end, the film made $19.9 million in the US on a $70 million budget.\n\nDue to its poor box office performance in the US, the film was released straight to video in most countries. In the UK, a 2004 showing on BBC One was very well received.\n\nThe film received polarized reviews, some very positive and some very negative. One example of a positive review was on timeout.com, which favorably compared the plot of \"Hard Rain\" to writer Graham Yost's earlier and more financially successful project, \"Speed\", and suggested that it could be considered a spiritual sequel to \"Speed\". Another review, on starpulse.com, praised the action scenes of \"Hard Rain\" yet criticized the plot, calling it \"mindless\" yet \"entertaining\". One particularly negative review came from Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film one star out of a possible four and stated: \"\"Hard Rain\" is one of those movies that never convince you its stories are really happening. From beginning to end, I was acutely aware of actors being paid to stand in cold water. Suspension of my disbelief in this case would have required psychotropic medications.\" Although he criticised the plot and the casting of Morgan Freeman as the criminal, he did praise the special effects. On the TV show Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, he and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film \"two thumbs down\". Commenting on its commercial performance, \"Total Film\" called it the \"biggest flop of 1998\" but said it deserved to perform better because of its \"fun tension-cranking moments\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes it has a 28% approval rating based on 43 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"\"Hard Rain\" is an implausible heist movie soaked in disaster movie trappings.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n"}
{"id": "2039956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039956", "title": "David S. Touretzky", "text": "David S. Touretzky\n\nDavid S. Touretzky is a research professor in the Computer Science Department and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon University. He received a BA in Computer Science at Rutgers University in 1978, and earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. (1984) in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Touretzky has worked as an Internet activist in favor of freedom of speech, especially what he perceives as abuse of the legal system by government and private authorities. He is a notable critic of Scientology.\n\nTouretzky's research interests lie in the fields of artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, and learning. This includes machine learning and animal learning, and in particular neural representation of space in rodents (e.g., in the hippocampus) and in robots. In 2006, he was recognized as a Distinguished Scientist by the Association for Computing Machinery.\n\nSince the 1990s, Touretzky has worked to expose the actions of the Church of Scientology. He sees the actions of the organization as a threat to free speech, and he has taken a prominent part in Internet-based activism to oppose it, also appearing regularly as a critic in radio and print. He has also worked to expose what he sees as dangerous and potentially life-threatening treatments provided by Narconon, the Scientology-based drug rehabilitation program. He maintains a Web site named \"Stop Narconon\", which archives media articles critical of the program. Dr. Touretzky's research into Narconon was a primary source of information for a series of \"San Francisco Chronicle\" newspaper articles criticizing Narconon on June 9 and June 10, 2004 that ultimately led to the organization's program being rejected by the California school system in early 2005.\n\nTouretzky has undertaken extensive research into the secret upper levels of Scientology, and he has made this information available to the public on the \"OT III Scholarship Page\" (concerning Xenu) and the \"NOTs Scholars Page\" (concerning the higher Operating Thetan levels). These pages, he states, are academic studies of Scientology's texts, and the proprietary materials are therefore legally available due to careful application of the academic fair use provisions of copyright law. The Church has failed in their attempts to have them removed, after repeatedly threatening Touretzky with lawsuits and filing complaints against him with Carnegie Mellon University. Carnegie Mellon, in turn, has issued statements in support of Professor Touretzky, noting that his criticism of Scientology is a personal affair and not the opinion of the University itself.\n\nTouretzky has been the object of public attacks by the Church of Scientology, including various \"dead agent\" campaigns against him. He has been accused of religious bigotry, racism, misogyny, misuse of government funds, support for terrorism, and collusion with the pharmaceutical industry, among other misdeeds.\n\nDavid Touretzky is an Internet free speech activist. He has supported several movements in what he perceives as abuse of the legal system by government and private authorities.\n\nIn 2000, Touretzky testified as an expert witness for the defense in Universal City Studios et al. v. Reimerdes et al., a suit brought by seven motion picture studios against the publishers of \"\" (the case name refers to Shawn Reimerdes, an unrelated defendant who settled prior to trial.) The suit concerned the publication of DVD decryption software known as DeCSS, which the plaintiffs asserted was illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Dr. Touretzky testified as an expert in computer science on the expressive nature of computer code, and convinced the court that code was indeed speech. Touretzky also created an online gallery of various renditions of the DeCSS software. Readers sent in their own renditions of the decryption algorithm, including a mathematical description, a haiku, and a square dance.\n\nIn reaction to the federal prosecution and eventual imprisonment of 18-year-old political activist Sherman Austin for hosting bomb-making instructions entitled \"Reclaim Guide\" on his web site, Dr. Touretzky provided a mirror on his Carnegie Mellon website for more than two years, although he acknowledged on the website that his own reposting of the information did not violate the plain language of the statute under which Austin was convicted. In May 2004, to avoid harassment of the university and controversy in the media, Dr. Touretzky moved the mirror from the Carnegie Mellon server to a private site.\n\nIn 2011, Touretzky began hosting a mirror of the website of George Hotz, containing executable files and instructions facilitating the jailbreaking of the Sony PlayStation 3, after Sony filed lawsuits against Hotz and other hackers aiming to utilize the takedown provisions of the DMCA to remove the content from the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2039969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039969", "title": "Rise of the Dragon", "text": "Rise of the Dragon\n\nRise of the Dragon is a graphic adventure game released in 1990 for DOS and Macintosh, and later remade for the Sega CD (1993) as well as the Amiga. It was one of the few adventure game titles developed by Dynamix, a company that was better known as an action and flight simulator game developer. The game is set in a dark future cyberpunk version of Los Angeles.\n\nGameplay in \"Rise of the Dragon\" is similar to that of Dynamix's other 1990s adventure games, \"The Adventures of Willy Beamish\" and \"Heart of China\". The screen shows the current room roughly from the protagonist Blade's perspective. Movement occurs with the cursor, which becomes an arrow to proceed to another room or a magnifying glass to get closer to a part of the current scene.\n\nThe game has a time meter that reflects the passage of time in the game. Each of Blade's actions takes up a certain amount of time. Some game events will only occur at particular times. The player must find a way to delay the plans of the game's villains, or the game will end after only three days and Blade will not have time to save the day. Travelling between locations can take up a lot of in-game time, so players must plan their moves strategically.\n\nSeveral puzzles in \"Rise of the Dragon\" have multiple possible solutions. Blade's activities can influence the plot of the game later on. Game characters remember his earlier behavior, and if he says the wrong thing to key characters they will refuse to help him with his work, which can render the game unwinnable.\n\n\"Rise of the Dragon\" features two action scenes and an aim-and-shoot scene. It is possible to beat the game without playing through all of these scenes. If the player tries and fails to complete the action scenes several times, the game will offer the chance to automatically win the sequence and move on to the next scene.\n\nIn 2053, William 'Blade' Hunter is a former Los Angeles Police Department officer turned private detective. When the mayor's rebellious daughter Chandra is found dead and horribly mutated after experimenting with a new designer drug called MTZ, Blade is called upon to track down those responsible. Blade makes contact with a streetwise friend of Chandra nicknamed \"the Jake\", who indicates Chen Lu as the dealer who had been supplying Chandra with the lethal drug. Blade goes to Chen Lu's apartment only to find Lu assassinated with an overdose of MTZ, as a punishment for attracting public attention by causing the death of a powerful man's daughter.\n\nAs Blade tries to reconcile with his girlfriend Karyn, who works at the Crime Records Bureau, he enlists her help to track down Lu's accomplices and discover the mutagenic nature of the MTZ drug. It is revealed that the MTZ business is part of an underground Chinese Mafia operation led by Deng Hwang, a megalomaniacal drug kingpin intent on world domination. Blade also meets an old fortune teller, who tells him the present year coincides with that of the foretold coming of Chinese dragon Bahumat.\n\nBlade disrupts the MTZ production schedule by blowing up the local drug plant, but in doing so he is spotted by Hwang's men. Hwang has the Jake captured in an attempt to lure Blade into a trap, but Blade manages to rescue the Jake and later sabotages the Triad's plans to poison the Hollywood reservoir with MTZ and exterminate the population of Los Angeles. In retaliation, Hwang has Karyn kidnapped and strapped to a chair, threatening to inject MTZ into her system.\n\nBlade infiltrates Hwang's headquarters and, depending on the player's actions, either manages or fails to rescue Karyn. He eventually comes face-to-face with Hwang himself, who suddenly transforms into the dragon Bahumat. In a climactic final battle, Bahumat is defeated by Blade. Outside the headquarters, Blade is greeted by the mayor but angrily punches him for using Blade as a pawn in his crackdown operation and endangering his life and Karyn's. Blade then walks away either with Karyn, if she has survived, or alone.\n\nDeveloped by Game Arts, several differences existed between the Sega CD and DOS versions of \"Rise of the Dragon\", the most prominent being the addition of voice acting to the Sega CD release. The graphics of the Sega CD version had to use a more limited range of colors than the DOS version, 64 on screen colors compared to the 256 of the computer, which gave it a green tint.\n\nThe Sega CD version added voice actors to the game (including Cam Clarke in the main role as William 'Blade' Hunter) and was given a MA-17 rating by the Videogame Rating Council. Unlike the ESRB rating system, VRC ratings do not indicate the reasons why a game received a particular rating, but mature content in the game includes profanity, references to a fictional illicit drug, cross-dressing, prostitution and partial female nudity. A scene with a French kiss and implied sex was removed from the Sega CD release.\n\n\"Rise of the Dragon\" was a commercial hit; Craig Ritchie of \"Retro Gamer\" later called it \"very successful\".\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"Rise of the Dragon\" more effectively depicted a cyberpunk atmosphere than other games. The magazine liked the story, non-text parser interface, audio, and the fact that completing the arcade sequences was optional, and concluded that the game \"is not only an outstanding product in its own right, but points the way for the future of graphic adventures\". \"Dragon\" gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.\n\n\"The One\" gave the Amiga version of \"Rise of the Dragon\" an overall score of 92%, noting \"evident\" stylistic influence from \"Blade Runner\", and praising the game's graphics, stating that \"\"Rise of the Dragon\" has probably some of the most detailed artwork yet seen in an adventure.\" \"The One\" calls \"Rise of the Dragon\" a \"Very entertaining futuristic tale, with plenty of challenge\" and praises the game's plot twists, and the game's multiple endings. \"The One\" also expresses the need for lateral thinking in regards to the game's puzzles, stating that the player must \"put a lot of thought into what [they're] doing\". \"The One\" criticises the controls and UI, calling the controls \"a little limiting\", and expresses that they require getting used to.\n\nIn 1991, \"Rise of the Dragon\" won a Special Award for Artistic Achievement from \"Computer Gaming World\". In 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 83rd best game of all time, stating: \"So good that a rival publisher tried to steal it, this cyberpunk game used rotoscoping, hot spot mapping, and cinematic cuts long before they were standard\", and the 12th most innovative computer game for pioneering of \"using a dynamic, hot-spotted map as the game world travel interface.\" In 1991, \"PC Format\" named \"Rise of the Dragon\" one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors wrote, \"When you do finish marvelling at the excellent on-screen graphics, you'll want to get right into the action too.\"\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" deemed the Sega CD version \"an almost perfect translation of the PC title.\" Though they criticized the absence of replay value, they approved of the gritty tone and \"atmospheric\" graphics, and scored it a 7.6 out of 10.\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Rise of the Dragon\" the 83rd-best computer game ever released. A \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" retrospective in 2000 summarized \"Rise of the Dragon\" as \"an underrated classic [...] way ahead of its time\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2039988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039988", "title": "Orders, decorations, and medals of Canada", "text": "Orders, decorations, and medals of Canada\n\nThe orders, decorations, and medals of Canada comprise a complex system by which Canadians are honoured by the country's sovereign for actions or deeds that benefit their community or the country at large. Modelled on its British predecessor, the structure originated in the 1930s, but began to come to full fruition at the time of Canada's centennial in 1967, with the establishment of the Order of Canada, and has since grown in both size and scope to include dynastic and national orders, state, civil, and military decorations; and various campaign medals. The monarch in right of each Canadian province also issues distinct orders and medals to honour residents for work performed in just their province. The provincial honours, as with some of their national counterparts, grant the use of post-nominal letters and or supporters and other devices to be used on personal coats of arms.\n\nThe monarch is regarded as the fount of all honours—as he or she is the only person who may create new national honours—and acts as the Sovereign of all of Canada's orders; she, or other members of the Canadian Royal Family, will conduct inductions or present medals. In Canada, the monarch is represented by the governor general, who also carries out investitures and distributes awards in the sovereign's name. As such, the administration of the honours system is carried out by the Chancellery of Honours at Government House, which is a part of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada. The governor general also sets out via Order in Council the order of precedence for the wearing of insignia, decorations, and medals. Provincial and territorial honours are similarly awarded by their respective Lieutenant governors or Commissioners.\n\nSince as far back as the reign of King Louis XIV, the monarchs that reigned over colonies in New France, British North America, and present-day Canada have bestowed royal honours, decorations, and medals on those living under their sovereignty, in recognition of their services to the state. Early Governors of New France also desired to establish local honours in or import European honours to Canada; Samuel de Champlain, for instance, founded on 14 November 1606 the Order of Good Cheer (still extant today) and Charles de Montmagny had designs to establish the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in New France while he was governor from 1635 to 1648. The Ordre Royal et Militaire de Saint-Louis, established by King Louis XIV in 1693 specifically to honour worthy French, Catholic military officers, came to be one of the most familiar honours in New France; some 300 people associated with Canada were appointed into it, Louis-Hector de Callière being the first. Appointments into the order continued even after the transfer of New France to the British Crown in 1763.\n\nAfter the creation of British North America, Canadians were entitled to receive British imperial honours, though the awarding of these was not consistently allowed. From Confederation until the Nickle Resolution in 1919, the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George served as the equivalent of today's Order of Canada, being the highest non-peerage honour available to Canadian politicians, judges, and civil servants. Appointments into the Order of the British Empire, into grades below those that carried a title, were also commonly made. Besides knighthoods, peerage titles (both hereditary and life) were also bestowed on Canadians, sometimes with uniquely Canadian designations—such as Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe and Baron Beaverbrook of Beaverbrook in the Province of New Brunswick and of Cherkley in the County of Surrey—and permitted those so honoured to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster. Such acts of recognition were carried out by the reigning British monarch. Prior to Confederation, the sovereign did so on the advice of the British prime minister, the names of those to be honoured either selected by the colonial governor or governor general in British North America and passed on to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and then the prime minister, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and passed on to the prime minister, or by the prime minister himself. The British government felt no obligation to consult any government in British North America before bestowing an honour upon any resident of the colonies. Following Confederation, the Prime Minister of Canada submitted a list of names to the monarch via the governor general, though the governor general also continued to recommend individuals for honours without the Canadian prime minister's knowledge.\n\nThis practice came into question in 1901, when Governor General the Earl of Minto nominated Thomas Shaughnessy for a knighthood, even after Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier (an opponent of Shaughnessy) expressed his opposition to the idea, leading Laurier in the following year to draft a policy whereby all nominees for honours be approved by the prime minister before being forwarded to Westminster. Later, the public began to suspect the worthiness of those receiving the knighthoods and elevations to the peerage; the controversy that surrounded the appointment of Sam Hughes as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1915 marked the beginning of the end of such honours in Canada. After it was revealed in 1917 that British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had been selling peerage titles and knighthoods to raise money for his political party (\"Montreal Star\" owner Hugh Graham's elevation as the Baron Atholstan being granted seemingly without merit and against the advice of both Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden and Governor General the Duke of Devonshire), the awarding of such distinctions in Canada immediately ceased. Thereafter, the House of Commons of Canada in 1917 and 1919 passed the Nickle Resolutions, which, though never legally binding, generally cemented the cease of titular awards to Canadians. The end of the conferment of imperial honours on Canadians came in 1955. Awards for gallantry and bravery, such as the Victoria Cross, however, remained available and knighthoods were still conferred: on Sir Frederick Banting in 1934, Sir Edwin Leather in 1964, and Sir Terry Matthews in 2002. Further, some pre-existing Canadian peerages continued to be recognised—the Baron de Longueuil and Baron of Fleet, for example—and still others were granted after 1919 by the sovereign of Canada, such as the Viscount Bennett of Mickleham, Hopewell, and Calgary.\n\nGovernor General the Viscount Monck had originally pushed for a distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, to be called the \"Order of St. Lawrence\". The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a \"Royal Order of Canada\". The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead to steer clear of the controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; this was the first time an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around how to go about creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the Nickle Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project to consider all the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.\n\nThis process was refined through the Second World War and Korean War, though the pool of available honours became smaller and smaller as the decades progressed; non-titular British honours continued to be granted until 1946 and, from 1950 and 1953, only British military decorations were permitted. In 1942, the Canada Medal was created by royal warrant of King George VI, though none was ever struck, and the Canadian Forces Decoration was founded in 1947. Though the Letters Patent of 1947 issued by the King permitted the governor general to exercise most of the monarch's Royal Prerogative on his behalf, it was agreed between George VI and his Canadian prime minister at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, that the sovereign alone would retain the prerogative to create new honours. In 1951, the first distinctly Canadian campaign medal, the Korea Medal, was created, when other Commonwealth countries used the British version.\n\nThe centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 provided the right opportunity and circumstances in which to establish Canada's first order: the Order of Canada. The system was officially established in 1972 and has since expanded, mostly through the 1990s, and generally attracted little criticism; indeed, the orders, decorations, and medals of Canada inspired other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, to adopt similar approaches in their respective jurisdictions, as did each of Canada's provinces. However, some experts in the field, such as Christopher McCreery, have pointed out what they see as deficiencies in the construct: At the 2006 conference on Commonwealth Honours, the concern was raised that Canada does not have a way to recognize the nation's very best; the three grades of the Order of Canada being insufficient to do so. It was suggested that either two more levels be added to the Order of Canada, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders, or create a new single class but limited-membership order, similar to the Order of New Zealand. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels of each of the other orders, contrary to international practice. McCreery echoed these comments in 2010 and added that the Canadian honours system was lacking a polar medal, such as those issued in other northern nations, as well as a public service order, akin to the Imperial Service Order, and honours to specifically recognise protective services other than the police forces.\n\nIn June 2010, McCreery highlighted inconsistency in honouring those in Canada's royal family. For example, the Queen Mother was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on only an honorary basis, though the Canadian Forces Decoration awarded to her was substantive. Similarly, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was offered only honorary appointment to the Order of Canada, which he refused on the grounds that, as the royal consort of the Queen, he was Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment, as he had been awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration and Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan. In 2013, the constitutions of the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit were amended to create for each of the three grades of each order an \"extraordinary\" category reserved for those members of the Royal Family (in the Canadian Forces for the latter order) nominated and approved for appointment. Upon taking office, governors general and viceregal consorts become Extraordinary Companions of the Order of Canada and the governor general an Extraordinary Commander of the Order of Military Merit.\n\nAll honours in Canada emanate from the country's monarch, who is regarded as the fount of honour; only he or she may create new honours, though this, as part of the Royal Prerogative, is generally done on the advice of the sitting ministers of the Crown. The sovereign's representative in Canada, the governor general, administers most of the honours system through the Chancellery of Honours, which is a part of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada. The governor general also sets out, via Order in Council, the order of precedence for the wearing of insignia, decorations, and medals.\n\nThe momentum to create a new honour typically originates at either the Chancellery of Honours or the Department of National Defence, though private organisations or individuals may also make proposals. The chancellery will investigate whether or not the suggested honour is necessary and if it will conform within the national honours structure. Should it meet these criteria, the notion is put before the Honours Policy Committee—a group of senior public servants, formed in 1980 within the Privy Council Office—and then, if approved, is moved before the Cabinet for an Order in Council to be drawn up. On the prime minister's advice, via the governor general, the documents and drawings for the new honour are presented to the Queen for her consideration; only with her signature on the relevant letters patent and the design sketches does the new honour officially become extant. Any future amendments to the honour's appearance or award criteria do not need the monarch's approval; the governor general will perform such tasks instead.\n\nIn the Canadian structure, unlike its counterparts in Britain and other countries, nominees names are put forward to the governor general by independent committees, which in turn receive nominations from the public, in an attempt to create a non-partisan process that avoids political controversy. Most orders have a unique advisory committee, consisting of individuals relevant to the scope of the particular order, all appointed by the governor general or a delegate; for instance, the Advisory Committee for the Order of Military Merit has six members: one appointed by the governor general, four by the chief of the Defence Staff, and the chief of the Defence Staff him or herself. There are also advisory councils or committees for decorations in general and for valour decorations, specifically. The Secretary to the Governor General will usually serve as secretary general to many of these boards.\n\nThe Canadian honours system also includes two dynastic orders—the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order—and one personal award of the sovereign—the Royal Victorian Chain. These were created by the sovereign alone and inductions and presentations are at his or her personal discretion.\n\nCanada has both dynastic (created by the sovereign and membership in which is a personal gift of the monarch, granted without ministerial advice) and national (created by order-in-council and membership in which is carried out on the advice of advisory committees) orders. These have a number of grades or classes to acknowledge different levels of achievement. Usually, the insignia for the top grades are worn on a neck ribbon by men and on a pinned bow by women, while those for the lower levels are worn suspended on ribbons attached to the left of the jacket of dress, those for women again usually on a bow. These insignia are presented to the recipient by either the monarch or governor general. Orders are not awarded to individuals, instead one is appointed into membership in a society of honour, and can be promoted to higher grades within the group. The appointment to an order also entitles the appointee to post-nominal letters.\n\nAdmission to the Order of Merit () is the highest civilian award for merit in Canada. Founded in 1902 by King Edward VII to recognise distinguished service in the armed forces, science, art, literature, or for the promotion of culture, the Order of Merit has one grade and carries with it only the post-nominal letters \"OM\". One of the few dynastic orders in Canada, the order's membership is limited to, at one time, no more than 24 living individuals from the Commonwealth realms. Four Canadians have been appointed to the order: William Lyon Mackenzie King, Wilder Penfield, Lester B. Pearson, and Jean Chrétien. There is only one grade to the Order of Merit: Member (OM).\n\nThe Order of Canada () is the country's second highest civilian honour for merit and is administered by the Governor General-in-Council, on behalf of the monarch of Canada. Created in 1967, appointment is granted to those who adhere to the order's motto \"Desiderantes meliorem patriam\" (Latin for: \"desiring a better country\"), meaning that, in essence, the honour recognises lifetime contributions made by Canadians who made a major difference to Canada, or non-Canadians who made the world better by their actions. Musicians, politicians, artists, entertainers, benefactors, and many more have been accepted into the order; since its creation, more than 6,000 people have been appointed to the Order of Canada. The order, of which the monarch is Sovereign and the serving governor general is Chancellor and Principal Companion, is currently composed of three grades: Companion (CC), Officer (OC), and Member (CM).\n\nFor each grade, there is an \"extraordinary\" category reserved for those members of the Royal Family nominated and approved for appointment. Upon taking office, governors general and viceregal consorts become Extraordinary Companions for life or until removal from the order.\n\nThe Order of Military Merit () is a society of members of the Canadian Forces who have demonstrated dedication and devotion beyond the call of duty. Established in 1972 by Queen Elizabeth II, who serves as the order's Sovereign, with the governor general as the Chancellor and the chief of the Defence Staff as Principal Commander, the award has three classes: Commander (CMM), Officer (OMM), and Member (MMM).\n\nFor each grade, there is an \"extraordinary\" category reserved for those members of the Royal Family in the Canadian Forces nominated and approved for appointment. Upon taking office, governors general become Extraordinary Commanders for life or until removal from the order.\n\nMembers of Canada's various police bodies who have demonstrated conspicuous merit and exceptional service are inducted into the Order of Merit of the Police Forces (), which was created in 2000 by Queen Elizabeth II. As with the Order of Military Merit, the reigning monarch is the Sovereign of the order, while the governor general is the Chancellor and the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police acts as Principal Commander. The order has three grades: Commander (COM), Officer (OOM), and Member (MOM).\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order () is a dynastic order established in 1896 by Queen Victoria to recognise those who performed exemplary personal service for the sovereign. The order's day is 20 June, the date of Victoria's accession to the throne, and its motto is \"Victoria\". The structure includes five classes and a medal, though the levels of Knight or Dame Grand Cross and Knight or Dame Commander, available to all in other Commonwealth realms, are not normally open to Canadian citizens, due to the titles that come with appointment to those grades and the Cabinet's adherence to the non-binding Nickle Resolution. Members of the Royal Family, however, as subjects of the Canadian monarch but not citizens of Canada, can, and do, occupy the two uppermost grades. The order's classes, in order of seniority, are: Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO), and Member (MVO). Award of the Royal Victorian Medal allows the recipient the use of the post-nominal letters \"RVM\".\n\nThe Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem () is a working order of charitably minded men and women whose philanthropy is expressed principally through its two foundations: the St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem and St. John Ambulance. The order traces its origins to the Knights Hospitaller of the Crusades, who served the Abbey of St. Mary's small hospital for sick pilgrims in Jerusalem in the 12th century. It was established in the United Kingdom in 1831 and given a royal charter by Queen Victoria in 1888, and has existed in Canada in some form for many years, but was only officially brought into the Canadian honours system in 1995. The governor general is the Prior and Chief Officer in Canada, while the lieutenant governors serve as Vice-Prior in their respective province. Each is also automatically appointed as a Knight or Dame of Justice in case of the Prior and his or her spouse, or a Knight or Dame of Grace in the case of lieutenant governors upon being sworn into their viceregal office. Spouses of lieutenant governors are made Officers. Members of the Royal Family may also hold the level of Bailiffs or Dames Grand Cross, with the post-nominal letters \"GCStJ\".\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 5,500 active Canadian members in the Order, induction being granted by nomination only to Canadian citizens or permanent residents at or over the age of 18. This is done at the discretion of the Sovereign Head of the Order, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of the Prior.\n\nIn Canada, the order has five grades: Bailiffs or Dames Grand Cross (GCStJ), Knight or Dame (KStJ or DStJ), Commander (CStJ), Officer (OStJ), and Serving Member (SBStJ or SSStJ). Esquires are not members of the Order but instead members of the Priory.\n\nDecorations are awarded for gallantry, civilian bravery, or meritorious services; only the Royal Victorian Medal (post-nominal letters \"RVM\", ), a decoration associated with the Royal Victorian Order, is not slotted into any of the three aforementioned categories. They are similar to national orders, are created by the sovereign and conferred by her or her viceroy, and are worn on the left side of the jacket or dress. Decorations also entitle the recipient to post-nominal letters.\n\nThe military valour decorations were created on 2 February 1993 by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under then prime minister Brian Mulroney. For all three military valour decorations, recipients must be a member of the Canadian Forces or an allied armed force that is serving with or in conjunction with the Canadian Forces, on or after 1 January 1993. All military valour decorations may be awarded posthumously.\n\nThe Victoria Cross (post-nominal letters \"VC\", ) is the highest award for valour available to members of the Canadian Forces of any rank, in any service, and allies serving under or with Canadian military command. Based on the British version of the same medal, it is only awarded for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Prior to 1993, the original Victoria Cross was awarded to 94 Canadians, none of whom are now living; since its creation, no Canadian Victoria Cross has been issued.\n\nThe Star of Military Valour (post-nominal letters \"SMV\", ) was created as an award for Canadian Forces personnel who had demonstrated \"distinguished and valiant service in the presence of the enemy.\" The star may be presented more than once, an additional bar on the medal's ribbon marking each subsequent award. It was only first presented in 2006, as Canada's participation in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan created for the first time circumstances wherein one could carry out actions deserving of the Star of Military Valour.\n\nThe Medal of Military Valour (post-nominal letters \"MMV\", ) is awarded to members of the Canadian Forces for \"an act of valour or devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.\" The medal, too, was only first awarded in 2006 and may be earned multiple times, marked by the addition of bars to the medal's ribbon.\n\nEstablished on 1 May 1972 by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet headed by Pierre Trudeau, the bravery decorations are awarded to any person who risked his or her life to save or protect another person; it is not necessary that the incident take place in Canada, and no particular person must be Canadian, but it is required that at least one individual involved in the occurrence be a Canadian citizen. Nominations must be made within two years of the incident, or within two years after a court or a coroner has concluded its review on the circumstances surrounding the incident or act of bravery, and each decoration may be awarded posthumously.\nThe Cross of Valour (post-nominal letters \"CV\", ) is the highest ranking of the Canadian bravery decorations, and is awarded for \"acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril.\" It was intended to both replace the never-issued Medal of Courage of the Order of Canada, and to act as the Canadian equivalent of the George Cross. It was presented for the first time on 20 July 1972.\n\nPresented to both living and deceased individuals deemed to have performed \"acts of conspicuous courage in circumstances of great peril,\" the Star of Courage (post-nominal letters \"SC\", ) is the second-highest ranking of Canadian bravery decorations. As of April 2018, the Star of Courage has been presented to 458 people, though no bars have yet been issued.\n\nThe Medal of Bravery (post-nominal letters \"MB\", ) is the third rank of the bravery decorations, awarded in recognition of \"acts of bravery in hazardous circumstances,\" and has been awarded most frequently; as of April 2018, 3,304 medals had been awarded.\n\nThe meritous service decorations are each divided into military and civilian categories, which each may be awarded to both Canadians and non-Canadians. The set of awards was initially formed on 11 June 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, but consisted of decorations available only to Canadian Forces personnel; it was on 6 June 1991 that the civilian classifications were added.\n\nThe Meritorious Service Cross (post-nominal letters \"MSC\", ) is intended to recognize individuals—both Canadian and foreign—who have carried out meritorious acts bringing benefit and honour. The military division recognises highly professional acts that are of considerable benefit to the Canadian Forces, while its civilian counterpart honours similar acts—whether in athletics, diplomatic relations, humanitarian activities, etc.—that benefit the nation.\n\nThe Meritorious Service Medal (post-nominal letters \"MSM\", ) is the secondary meritorious service decoration and recognises highly professional acts that are of considerable benefit to the Canadian Forces by military personnel, and to the nation by civilians.\n\nCanada has various types of medals, some part of the official honours system and others not. Those in the former category tend to be related to state organisations, such as police forces, fire protection, or the military. These can be further sub-categorised into long service and campaign medals. Others are awarded to military and civilians alike for anniversaries—the Canadian Centennial or the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, for example—or for community service. Still others are awarded by international organisations and integrated into the Canadian honours structure; the United Nations Medals and North Atlantic Treaty Organization medals, for example. As medals are awarded more widely than orders or decorations, they are typically presented by higher-ranking officials in the organization the recipient is a part of. Only the Canadian Forces Decoration grants a holder the use of post-nominal letters.\n\nWithin the Canadian system of honours are medals that specifically recognise death or severe injury in the course of military service. The Memorial Cross () was created in 1919 by King George V, it is to be awarded to the mother, widow, widower, or next of kin of any member of the Canadian Forces who loses his or her life in active service, including peacekeeping, and other such international operations. From amongst the recipients of the medal has been drawn annually the Silver Cross Mother. Later, in 2008, Queen Elizabeth II approved the establishment of the Sacrifice Medal () as a replacement for the Wound Stripe, to be presented to any member of the Canadian Forces or allied forces who were wounded or killed in action. The medal is also awarded posthumously to any member of the Canadian Forces who dies under honourable circumstances as a result of an injury or disease related to military service.\n\nCanada's campaign medals are a continuation of the tradition of the monarch recognising service in a designated military operation or performance of duty in a geographical theatre; save for the General Campaign Stars and Medals, each is associated with a particular conflict. The general star and medal are issued for any active service in a combat zone, which one or ones being distinguished by additional clasps that are worn on the medal's ribbon. Such medals presently recognised in the Canadian honours system are:\n\n\nCanadians earlier qualified for British campaign medals, though these awards were, at the time, not foreign to Canada. Some were created specifically for Canada, such as the Canadian General Service Medal, which was issued in 1899 to recognise active participation in defending the country from the Fenian raids and later in suppressing the Red River Rebellion.\n\n\nThe Polar Medal () and Sovereign's Medal for Volunteers () were both created by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015, incorporating and replacing the Governor General's Northern Medal (established by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson in 2005) and the Governor General's Caring Canadian Award (established by Governor General Roméo LeBlanc in 1995), respectively. This made them honours of the Crown, permitting them to be incorporated into the Canadian honours system.\nUntil 1977, the practice for coronation and jubilee medals was for authorities in the United Kingdom to decide on a total number of medallions to be produced and allocate how many were to be distributed to each of the British Empire and Crown dependencies and possessions, and later Commonwealth of Nations countries. From that point, the award of the medals was at the discretion of the local government authority. Such medals are awarded to Canadians who have been deemed to have made a significant contribution to their fellow citizens, their community or to Canada. So that all regions of the country are recognised equally, the federal, provincial, and civic governments all forward names to Rideau Hall, as do private organizations in the fields of the arts, sports, philanthropy, and charity. The full membership of the Order of Canada and Order of Military Merit, as well as all winners of Canadian bravery decorations will typically also receive commemorative medals automatically, while for members of the Canadian Forces, merit with length of service and prestige of current appointment is considered. Such medals presently recognised in the Canadian honours system are:\n\nEarlier commemorative medals for Canada or given to Canadians included:\n\nThe Canadian Forces Decoration (post-nominal letters CD) is given members of the Canadian Forces of all ranks who have completed twelve years of military service. By convention, it is also given to the Governor General of Canada upon his or her appointment as viceroy, which includes the designation of the title of \"Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada\". Despite its name, the Canadian Forces Decoration is a medal as opposed to a decoration.\n\nOther long service medals include:\n\n\n\nThe Canadian provinces each have their own internal honours system, though they differ in some ways from their federal counterpart. British Columbia was the first to create a provincial honour in 1953. However, after the establishment of the Canadian honours system in 1967, other provinces moved to initiate their own systems after the federal government refused to do so on their behalf. An agreement was eventually reached around 1990 on the placement of the provincial honours in the Canadian order of precedence for orders, decorations, and medals.\n\nState honours bestowed upon a Canadian by a foreign government must be approved by the Governor-General-in-Council before the insignia, decoration, or medal may be worn. Those for honours bestowed by other Commonwealth countries are worn, in the order of date of appointment or award, following all those for Canadian honours, should the recipient have any. The same from countries not in the Commonwealth are worn after those from Commonwealth countries, again in order of date of appointment or award. However, the insignia of orders, as well as medals and decorations, within the Imperial (i.e. British) honours system that were received by a Canadian prior to 1 June 1972 have a different order of wear, mixed with the designated order for Canadian honours.\n\nCanadians remain eligible for appointment into the Order of the Companions of Honour, as its statutes set aside a specific number of the order's total 65 places for residents of Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and 11 for those from any other Commonwealth country. Appointments are made on the recommendation of the appropriate cabinet. The order currently has three Canadian members—John de Chastelain, Margaret MacMillan, and Margaret Atwood, who were nominated by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of distinctly Canadian titles have been granted by the sovereign. These include (with existent ones in italics):\n\n\nMembers of the Canadian Royal Family, other than the sovereign, also hold peerages, though these were granted by letters patent issued by the sovereign of the United Kingdom and are used in Canada as courtesy titles. Further, Sylvana Tomaselli, a Canadian citizen, has been known as \"Countess of St. Andrews\" since her marriage to George Windsor, who uses the courtesy title \"Earl of St. Andrews\", a subsidiary title of his father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, a grandson of King George V. Upon the death of the Duke of Kent, is it expected that George will succeed to the title and Sylvana will become Duchess of Kent, Countess of St. Andrews, and Baroness Downpatrick, though her eldest son, Edward, also a citizen of Canada and the present Lord Downpatrick, and his wife, if any, will then use the titles Earl and Countess of St. Andrews as a courtesy title and their eldest son, if any, would be known as Lord Downpatrick. Also, Karen Gordon, a Canadian citizen, became Countess Spencer upon her marriage in 2011 to the Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThere are also 120 Baronets of Nova Scotia. Created between 1625 and 1706, these baronets technically represent the baronets of Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Heraldic Authority, which grants armorial bearings (coats of arms), flags, and badges to Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and corporate bodies, forms a part of the Canadian honours system; the granting of arms is regarded as an honour from the monarch, via the governor general, and thus are bestowed only on those whom the Chief Herald has deemed individuals worthy of receiving a grant of arms.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2039993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039993", "title": "Harry Catterick", "text": "Harry Catterick\n\nHarry Catterick (26 November 1919 – 9 March 1985) was an English football player and manager. As a player Catterick played for Everton and Crewe Alexandra, in a career that was interrupted by World War II, but he is most notable as a manager. After spells with Crewe, Rochdale and Sheffield Wednesday, with whom he won the Football League Second Division title, he took over at Everton and won the Football League twice and the FA Cup with the Merseyside club and is regarded as one of Everton's most successful managers. He finished his managerial career at Preston North End.\n\nHis father Harry Catterick Senior, was a former player and coach of Stockport. Catterick Junior played at amateur level for Stockport Schoolboys and for Cheadle Heath Nomads before signing part-time for Everton in 1937 as an 18-year-old. He was an apprentice marine engine engineer.\n\nHowever, his professional career coincided with the Second World War so that his opportunities to play were limited. His wartime scoring record with Everton was an impressive 55 goals in 71 games. During the war, he also played for Manchester United and Stockport County.\n\nHe finally made his league debut in August 1946, aged 26.\n\nReplacing Eric Taylor in 1958, Catterick achieved much success in his three years with Sheffield Wednesday. He led to team to the Division 2 title in 1959 and reached the FA Cup semi-final the following season, losing to Blackburn Rovers. The following season, Wednesday were league runners-up to Tottenham Hotspur, who won the Double. Catterick left just before the end of the season following an approach from Everton.\n\nCatterick took over from Johnny Carey in 1961. He soon began to motivate the team and made some astute signings. Under his authoritarian guidance, Everton won the First Division Championship in the 1962–63 season and the 1966 FA Cup Final. Although he narrowly lost the 1968 FA Cup Final, the same young team eventually dominated the 1969–70 season, winning the Championship again by one point short of a record points total. Catterick upheld Everton's tradition of cultured, attacking football.\n\nMany tipped Everton to dominate the 1970s under Catterick. However, a dip in the team's morale saw Everton struggle in the league the following season. The sale of Alan Ball to Arsenal in December 1971 came as a surprise to supporters. The struggle by a previously great team seriously affected Catterick's health, and he suffered a heart attack on 5 January 1972 near Sheffield after watching the league semi-final between West Ham United and Stoke City. He spent 14 days in hospital in Sheffield, being discharged on 19 January, and returned later that season, but later said that he felt it took him 12 months to fully recover.\n\nHe was persuaded to accept a non-executive role at the club on 11 April 1973 by chairman John Moores. He held that role until becoming manager of Preston North End in August 1975. It was a role he remained in up to May 1977. In the Summer of 1977 Catterick wrote to the FA inquiring about the England managerial vacancy but never got a reply.\n\nAfter that Catterick worked as a scout for Southampton FC.\n\nWhile the manager of rivals Liverpool, Bill Shankly, was an extrovert, Catterick was the opposite; an introvert. He disliked that the press gave information about his team out to the public, even simple details such as the formation. He ensured that the players on the team-sheet were only listed in alphabetical order so that rival managers would not know the line-up.\n\nHe also disliked televised games as he wanted to keep Everton's playing style out of the public eye. His rival Shankly was the opposite, welcoming televised matches as he felt it frightened opposing teams.\n\nCatterick once gave an \"exclusive\" story to a journalist that Everton had missed out on the signing of Preston North End's Howard Kendall and that Kendall had in fact opted to sign for Liverpool. The journalist published the story in the newspaper but hours later Kendall had in fact signed for Everton. It is claimed that Catterick had manipulated the media to score points off the field against Shankly.\n\nCatterick died of a heart attack shortly after watching Everton draw 2–2 with Ipswich Town in an FA Cup Sixth Round match at Goodison Park on 9 March 1985. He was 65 years old. His death came almost exactly five years after former Everton striker Dixie Dean had died while watching a game at the ground, also of a heart attack. Everton won the replay 1–0 and the players wore a black armband in honour of Catterick.\n\nHe is buried in the graveyard of St Anne's Church, St Anne's-on-the-Sea, Lancashire after a funeral held there six days after his death. His gravestone bears the Everton motto, \"Nil satis nisi optimum\".\n\n\nCatterick was portrayed by Colin Welland in the 1997 TV film \"The Fix\", which featured the events of the 1964 football betting scandal.\n\n"}

The leader of the Darwiish, Sayyid Mohamed, referred to it as \"The Tree of bad Counsel\". It was named as such because of a meeting where a coup was planned beneath the tree in early 1910. \n\nIn this meeting several senior members of the Daraawiish called for sedition in one way or another. Individuals who took part in this conspiracy include:\n\nThree plans were put forth, including (a) killing the Sayyid and replacing him with a new leader, (b) replacing him without killing him, and (c) deserting the Darwiish en masse. At the end, the third plan was carried out.\nThe Sayyid was informed about the conspiracy by a man of the Jama Siyaad subclan called \"Shire Cumbaal\", also spelled \"Shire Umbaal\". The exact words spoken by Shire Cumbaal was:\n\nDue to Shire Umbaal's defection from the seditious meeting, and the subsequent notification, the Daraawiish managed to capture many leading conspirators. Haan 'Awl was subsequently killed. Farah Mohamud Sugulle as the leader of Anjeel who sought to usurp the Sayyid's position had his father killed, although his own life was spared. Qoriyow was punished by the decision to have him demoted by stripping him of his previous position. Other figures had fled. The Reer Khalaf, a Majeerteen subclan who had previously been of the Taargooye wing of Darwiish, joined the defectors. As such, they were decimated in retaliation. Confrontations between Darwiish defectors and persistent Darwiish endured for a couple of years, but among the most prominent of these confrontations was the Hadega battle in March 1910 wherein the defectors had been aided by the Issa Majeerteen tribe. Nonetheless, at Hadega, notable casualties occurred on both sides, with Nur Dolbas (Dhalbaas) and Adan Egal (Cigaal) dead on the defectors side and Darwiish leaders Shire Umbaal and Adam Maleh were dead on the Darwiish side, with Shire Umbaal later being described by Robert Crewe-Milnes as \"a very important leader of the Dervishes\". Another Darwiish leader Nur Hidig, the father of Qusuusi member Abdi Nur Hidig, was permanently debilitated from wounds sustained at this battle.\n"}

Baziak was rector of the Clerical Seminarium in Lviv. Since 1933 he was an auxiliary bishop and, since 1944, Archbishop of Lviv. In 1951, after the death of Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha, he became the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese in Kraków.\n\nIn his capacity as Apostolic Administrator of Kraków, he recommended to Pope Pius XII the promotion of Father Karol Wojtyła (the future Pope John Paul II), who was then a priest in the Archdiocese of Kraków, to the office of auxiliary bishop of that Archdiocese. It is said that this recommendation was made in so strong terms that the Holy See made the appointment without even consulting with the Primate of Poland, Stefan Wyszyński, as was usual. Instead, Wyszyński received notice from the Vatican that he was simply to inform Father Wojtyła of the appointment, and ask him for his acceptance.\n\nAfter Wojtyła accepted and the appointment was formalized by the Pope, it fell to Archbishop Baziak to be the principal consecrator, Bishops Kominek and Jop being co-consecrators, of Wojtyła as a bishop, the episcopal consecration occurring in September 1958. Bishop Wojtyła would eventually succeed Baziak at Kraków after Baziak's death.\n"}

It has a similar format to other puzzle computer games such as \"Myst\", \"Uninvited\" and \"D\". It was first released on December 9, 1993 in the United States and on December 10, 1993 in Japan.\n\nA sequel was released in 1994 for the Sega Saturn. \n\nOne night two siblings—Samantha and Johnathan—come across a butterfly while exploring a grassy field. Enchanted by the butterfly's haunting beauty, Samantha chases after it. Johnathan follows reluctantly, repeating Grandmother's warnings about ghosts who roam the area and turn people into butterflies. The butterfly leads Samantha into the Mansion, where she becomes trapped: as Johnathan, the player must explore the Mansion, overcome several puzzles, and escape with his sister before the pair of them become permanent residents.\n\nWhile exploring the Mansion, the player encounters several ghosts, who appear in the form of butterflies:\n\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of D: the player travels between areas via 3D pre-rendered first-person full motion video sequences, pressing the action button whenever he finds something of interest. Doing so sometimes reveals an important item, such as a key or matchbox, which is added to his inventory. Also like D, the number of actual puzzles is fairly small: the player spends most of the game exploring the mansion and searching for important items.\n\nThe game was met with generally positive reviews. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave it a 7.6 out of 10, calling it \"An interesting first-person perspective game with fluid graphics and great sound effects.\" Scary Larry of \"GamePro\" described it as a solid \"The 7th Guest\" clone, especially praising the use of sound effects to enhance the horror.\n\nThe Mansion of Hidden Souls, titled in Japan, is a sequel for the Sega Saturn. The game was developed by System Sacom and published by Sega, and was released in 1994 in Japan, and in 1995 in North America and Europe.\n\nCompared with the original game, the later Saturn sequel was met with negative reviews, as critics found it failed to capture the strong qualities of the original despite being on a more powerful system.\n\nAccording to \"Sega Saturn Magazine\", the Japanese release of the Saturn version \"received a rather lukewarm reception\". In a later review of the PAL release, they said that though the graphics are considerably improved from the Sega CD version, the game completely fails to pull off the intended spooky atmosphere, and is also far too easy. Scary Larry of \"GamePro\" similarly commented that though the Saturn version has better graphics than the Sega CD version, it lacks the tension and eerie atmosphere. In particular, he remarked that the disembodied talking heads of the Saturn version \"will make you chuckle instead of cower\" and that the music is not as effective. A review in \"Next Generation\" was more positive, focusing on the ways in which the game improved the graphics and expanded on the content of the Sega CD original. They concluded \"In spite of its shortcomings, \"Mansion of Hidden Souls\" remains intriguing and engaging - it's just not a good game for newbies to the genre.\" \"Maximum\" called it \"a great-looking game, let down by the linear nature of the adventure\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2040018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040018", "title": "Sony/ATV Music Publishing", "text": "Sony/ATV Music Publishing\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing is an American music publisher owned by Sony Entertainment. It has the largest music publishing catalog in the world, with 4.53 million songs owned and administered as of March 31, 2019. The company was formed in 1995 with the merger of Sony Music Publishing and ATV Music, which was owned by entertainer Michael Jackson. Jackson had purchased ATV Music, which included the Lennon–McCartney song catalog, in 1985.\n\nIn 2012, an investor consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing acquired EMI Music Publishing to become the largest music publishing administrator in the world, with a library of over three million songs. In 2016, Sony bought the Jackson estate's 50% stake in Sony/ATV.\n\nIn April 2019, Jon Platt became CEO/Chairman of Sony/ATV Music Publishing after the contract of longtime CEO/Chairman Martin Bandier expired. In August 2019, management of Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Sony Music Entertainment were merged under the newly formed Sony Music Group.\n\nAssociated Television (ATV) was a British television broadcasting company founded in 1955 by Lew Grade. Over the next two decades, ATV expanded through acquisitions to become an entertainment conglomerate with business lines in the record industry, music publishing and film production.\n\nATV entered the music industry in 1958 when it acquired 50% of Pye Records, a British record company. ATV expanded into music publishing in 1966 when it acquired 50% of New World Music and Jubilee Music, subsidiaries of Chappell & Co. ATV also acquired the other 50% of Pye Records, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of ATV, including Pye Record's publishing subsidiary Welbeck Music.\nATV acquired Northern Songs, publisher of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.\n\nIn 1970, ATV formed a joint publishing venture with Kirshner Entertainment, called ATV-Kirshner Music. The partnership agreement expired at the end of 1972 at which time ATV Music was formed to manage all of ATV's publishing interests, including Northern Songs. ATV Music remained a successful organization in the music industry throughout the 1970s, largely due to the performance of Northern Songs. ATV Music also entered into co-publishing agreements with Lennon and McCartney, whose contract with Northern Songs expired in 1973.\n\nWhile ATV Music was successful, its parent company, now known as Associated Communications Corporation (ACC) began experiencing financial difficulties. From 1978 to 1981, ACC's profits declined due to losses in its film division, and share prices dropped dramatically. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television. In 1981, Grade entertained offers for Northern Songs, drawing interest from several bidders. McCartney, with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono, offered £21 million but the offer was declined by Grade who decided not to sell Northern Songs separately after other suitors, including CBS Songs, EMI Music Publishing, Warner Communications, Paramount Pictures and the Entertainment Co. showed interest in buying ATV Music as a whole.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian businessman Robert Holmes à Court had been acquiring shares of ACC and launched a takeover bid in earnest in January 1982. Grade resigned as chairman and was replaced by Holmes à Court who successfully acquired a controlling interest in the company. After Holmes à Court assumed control of ACC, ATV Music was no longer for sale.\n\nIn 1981, American singer Michael Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney, writing and recording several songs together. Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening while at the dining table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and how the songs were used. McCartney explained that music publishing was a lucrative part of the music business. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy the Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying \"Great. Good joke.\"\n\nJackson was first informed that the ATV catalog was up for sale in September 1984 by his attorney, John Branca, who had put together Jackson's earlier catalogue acquisitions. Warned of the competition he would face in buying such popular songs, Jackson remained resolute in his decision to purchase them. Branca approached McCartney's attorney to query whether the Beatle was planning to bid. The attorney stated he wasn't; it was \"too pricey.\" According to Bert Reuter, who negotiated the sale of ATV Music for Holmes à Court, \"We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time.\" Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono had been contacted as well but also did not enter bidding.\n\nThe competitors in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included Charles Koppelman and Marty Bandier's New York-based the Entertainment Co., Virgin Records, New York real estate tycoon Samuel J. LeFrak, and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46 million to Holmes à Court. Branca suggested the amount of the bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39 million. Jackson was only interested in the music copyrights, but the package also included buildings, a recording studio and studio equipment. The two sides signed a non-binding memorandum of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.\n\nThe two sides began drafting contracts in January 1985 and follow-through meetings began on March 16. Jackson's team described the negotiations as frustrating, with frequent shifts of position by the seller. One Holmes à Court representative described the negotiations as a \"game of poker\". Jackson's team thought they had reached a deal several times, but new bidders would enter the picture or they would encounter new areas of debate. The prospective deal went through eight drafts. In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from negotiations after having spent hundreds of hours and over $1 million. In June 1985, they learned Koppelman/Bandier had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy the catalog for $50 million.\n\nBut in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised his bid to $47.5 million, but he had the advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5 million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.\n\nThe only Beatles song in the Northern Songs catalog that was excluded from the sale was \"Penny Lane\", the rights to which were gifted by Holmes à Court to his then-teenage daughter Catherine before the sale, as it was her favorite Beatles song.\n\nJackson went on to use the Beatles' songs in numerous commercials, feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music. McCartney, who had used the Buddy Holly song catalogue in commercials, felt saddened. Privately, Jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at McCartney's attitude; he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written. At the time, McCartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world, with a net worth of $560 million and a royalty income of $41 million. Jackson stated, \"If he didn't want to invest $47.5 million in his own songs, then he shouldn't come crying to me now.\"\n\nAppearing on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" shortly after Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's acquisition of the Beatles songs and the impact of it on their relationship:And which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. So I kept thinking, it was time for a raise. Well you would, you know. [David Letterman: Yes, I think so.] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, \"That's just business Paul.\" You know. So, \"yeah it is\", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him.\n\nOno was pleased that Jackson had acquired Northern Songs and called it a \"blessing\". Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, \"Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring.\" She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. \"If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'\"\n\nSony, which sought to diversify into music, films and games, acquired CBS Records Inc. in January 1988, and was later renamed as Sony Music Entertainment Inc. in January 1991. Shortly after the acquisition by Sony a music publishing division, CBS Music Publishing, was formed. CBS Records' previous publishing division, CBS Songs, had been sold to SBK Entertinment in 1986, and SBK ended being sold to EMI in 1989. Looking for further opportunities, Sony aimed to expand its music publishing interests. CBS Records acquired the Nashville music publisher Tree International Publishing in 1989. In addition to publishing agreements with Sony Music recording artists, further acquisitions included the Fred Fisher publishing catalog of 3,000 songs and Nile Rodgers' Chic Music, Inc.\n\nIn 1995, Sony offered Jackson $110 million for a 50% stake in a combined ATV and Sony Music Publishing joint venture. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo. Jackson had essentially sold half ownership of the Beatles' and others' songs for a large profit. Jackson's own songs, grouped in the Mijac catalog, were not included in the deal; that catalog remained with Warner/Chappell Music until 2012.\n\nThe new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world. Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. \"Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies.\" He added that Jackson recognises Sony's \"leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself\". Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly. As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides would have to agree on a decision before it could be made. If neither party agreed on a decisions, they would not be implemented.\n\nIn 2006, Sony gained operational control of Sony/ATV and obtained an option to buy half of Jackson's stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million.\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing continued to acquire song catalogs in the 21st century.\n\nIn November 2001, the company signed country singer Tony Martin to an exclusive songwriting and co-publishing deal. Through the deal, they acquired Martin's Baby Mae Music catalog of 600 songs, which includes Joe Diffie's \"Third Rock from the Sun\" and Jeff Carson's \"Not on Your Love\".<ref name=\"Sony/ATV Music Publishing signs Tony Martin\"></ref>\n\nIn July 2002, Sony/ATV Music Publishing bought veteran country music publisher Acuff-Rose Music for $157 million. The venture included music publishing rights to 55,000 country music songs, including the music of Hank Williams, The Everly Brothers and Roy Orbison, and the master recordings of the defunct label Hickory Records. Sony/ATV revived Hickory Records as the in-house record label imprint in 2007, with distribution handled by Sony Music's RED Distribution. Sony/ATV also owns the masters of Dial Records, Four Star Records and Challenge Records.\n\nAnother company acquisition was made in 2007, when Sony/ATV purchased Famous Music, a music publishing business with song catalogue of more than 125,000 songs including \"Moon River\" and \"Footloose\", for $370 million. The deal, sought by Viacom, included the assumption of around $30 million of debt. The song catalogue also includes the hits of Eminem, Akon, Linda Perry, Björk, Shakira and Beck, as well as music from films released by Viacom divisions Paramount Pictures (which had founded Famous Music in 1928) and DreamWorks Pictures.<ref name=\"Viacom sells Famous Music to Sony/ATV\"></ref>\n\nDigital sheet music provider Musicnotes.com announced in June 2006 that it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Musicnotes.com would produce and sell digital sheet music and guitar tablature for songs from Sony/ATV's extensive catalog.<ref name=\"Sony/ATV songs to be available in digital sheet music\"></ref> \"As a music publisher, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to promote our songs and songwriters,\" Sony/ATV chairman and chief executive David Hockman announced in a statement.\n\nOn August 4, 2008, The Orchard secured a deal to globally digitally distribute and market the music catalog by Sony/ATV which includes: Sony Tree Productions, Hickory Records, and Masters International.\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Sony/ATV agreed to administer the music publishing rights of French motion picture company EuropaCorp, soon after acquiring 1,500 music copyrights from the studio. Other major studios that rely on Sony/ATV's administration include ViacomCBS (and it's Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Showtime, CBS, Comedy Central and DreamWorks brands, all since the Famous Music acquisition); Sony Pictures (except the studio's 1993-2012 catalogue, which is owned by Anthem Entertainment), 20th Century Fox, A+E Networks, Endemol Shine Group, Hit Entertainment, ITV Studios (including ITC Entertainment) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (including United Artists and Orion Pictures).\n\nIn November 2011, Citigroup announced a deal to sell EMI in two pieces. Recorded music went to Vivendi's Universal Music Group for $1.9 billion. EMI Music Publishing went to a Sony/ATV-led consortium for around $2.2 billion. Other members of the Sony consortium included the Michael Jackson Estate (about 10% ownership), US media billionaire David Geffen, US investment firm Blackstone and Abu Dhabi state-owned investment fund Mubadala. The deal won European Union approval in April 2012, on condition that some catalogs be divested. The global publishing rights for Famous Music UK and Virgin Music were sold to BMG Rights Management in December 2012 for $150 million.\n\nWhile Sony/ATV acquired about 30% of EMI Publishing, it put up a much lower cash contribution. In exchange, it agreed to administer the entire catalog. Sony/ATV became the largest music publisher administrator company in the world with more than 3 million songs and estimated revenues of over US$1.25 billion per year. Since 2012, Sony/ATV has administered Jackson's other publishing firm, Mijac, which includes songs written by Jackson himself (and others), and which used to be administered by competitor Warner/Chappell Music.<ref name=\"Michael Jackson's Mijac Music Catalog Moves to Sony/ATV\"></ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Sony/ATV bought out the Jackson estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million. In November 2018, Sony acquired the Mubadala Investment Company's 60% equity interest in EMI Music Publishing for $2.3 billion, based on an enterprise value of $4.75 billion, without offering any concessions to the European Commission. Following these transactions, Sony owned 100% of EMI Music Publishing.\n\nIn September 2016, Sony acquired the Jackson estate's stake in Sony/ATV in a deal valued at around $750 million. The Jackson estate retained a 10% stake in EMI Music Publishing, and its ownership of Mijac Music, which holds the rights to Michael Jackson's songs and master recordings. The revenue will primarily be used to pay off the estate's $250 million in debt, with the remainder to be placed in trust for Jackson's children.<ref name=\"Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing\"></ref>\n\nIn January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.\n\nA recent and relevant valuation is tied to Sony's acquisition of Jackson estate's stake in the company, completed on September 30, 2016 for $750 million. This values Sony/ATV at between $2.2 to $2.4 billion (including debt). \n\nBefore the 2016 transaction with Sony, the reported value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing has varied across time and sources. Such valuations are uncertain, as illustrated by their wide variations, given a lack of actual transactions.\n\nThe incident where Sony/ATV Music Publishing claimed the video was on PewDiePie's YouTube channel. Sony/ATV Publishing claimed revenue from all Dr. Phil videos (a show where PewDiePie reviews a TV show). In the video, he says, “I want to make Dr. Phil videos, but all of them get claimed by copy strike. I should probably go to court, that’s probably thousands of dollars in revenue.” According to PewDiePie, those videos were claimed manually.\n\n\n\n"}

She was commissioned in 1921 and sunk by Japanese aircraft south of Java on 1 March 1942.\n\nUSS \"Pecos\" was laid down as Fuel Ship No. 18 on 2 June 1920 at the Boston Navy Yard, Massachusetts (USA). During construction the ship was reclassified AO–6 on 17 July 1920. She was launched on 23 April 1921, sponsored by Miss Anna S. Hubbard and commissioned 25 August 1921. \n\nDuring the two decades before the United States entered World War II, \"Pecos\" operated in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nWhen Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, \"Pecos\" was in the Philippines supporting the ships of the United States Asiatic Fleet. She departed Cavite Navy Yard on 8 December 1941 for Balikpapan, Borneo arriving there on 14 December. After filling up with oil and gasoline, the tanker continued on to Makassar in Celebes, Netherlands East Indies where she refueled American warships fighting to slow the rapid advance of Japanese forces. She departed Makassar for Darwin, Australia on 22 December 1941.\n\nShe departed Darwin on 23 January 1942 headed for Soerabaja, Java early in 1942 where she fueled Allied ships until departing on 3 February after a Japanese air raid made that port untenable. Tjilatjap then became the oiler’s base until her cargo fuel tanks were empty. She then got underway in late February 1942 toward Ceylon to refill, embarking the surviving crew of . On 27 February, off Christmas Island, when the oiler was about to receive survivors of the seaplane tender (and former aircraft carrier) from destroyers and , land-based enemy bombers attacked the three ships. After fighting them off, the U.S. ships steamed south out of enemy land-based aircraft range and completed the transfer at sea in the early morning of 1 March 1942. \n\n\"Whipple\" then proceeded towards the Cocos Islands to rendezvous with the tanker \"Belita\", while \"Edsall\" was directed to return to Tjilatjap, carrying U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) pilots and ground crew who had been passengers on \"Langley\". The USAAF personnel were to assemble and fly 27 disassembled and crated P-40 fighters which had been shipped to Tjilatjap aboard the cargo ship . \"Pecos\", now carrying about 700 survivors from \"Langley\" and was ordered to Australia. \n\nAt noon that day, planes from the Japanese aircraft carrier located and attacked \"Pecos\" and struck again an hour later. For some time she sent out distress calls to any Allied ships in the area, as it was assumed the ship would probably be lost. Finally at midafternoon, a third strike sank the \"Pecos\". According to pilot Shinsaku Yamakawa of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the final attack was conducted by dive bombers from the aircraft carrier .\n\nExecutive Officer Lt. Commander Lawrence J. McPeake was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for valor for his actions aboard \"Pecos\". After the order to abandon ship was given by the ship's Captain, Commander Abernethy, Lt. Commander McPeake was seen engaging Japanese Aichi D3A1 \"Val\" dive bomber, which were machine-gunning survivors in the water. By some crewmembers' accounts, he was reported to have made it off the ship after it went down. Others reported him last being seen manning the machine gun. In fact, he did swim away from the vessel with another officer as it was going down. However, his body was never recovered and he was eventually listed as Killed In Action after the war. \n\nAfter \"Pecos\" was sunk, raced to the scene and rescued 232 survivors. Many of the survivors, although visible by crew members of \"Whipple\", were unable to be picked up and were abandoned at sea, due to the detection of what was thought to be two enemy submarines in the area at extremely close range.\n"}
{"id": "2040033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040033", "title": "Alberta separatism", "text": "Alberta separatism\n\nAlberta separatism comprises a series of 20th and 21st century movements advocating the secession of the province of Alberta from Canada, either by forming an independent nation or by creating a new union with one or more of Canada's western provinces. The main issues driving separatist sentiment have focused on power disparity relative to Ottawa and other provinces, and Canadian fiscal policy, especially as it pertains to fossil fuels.\n\nAlberta was established as a province on September 1, 1905. Alberta separatism comes from the belief that many Albertans hold that they are culturally and economically distinct from the rest of Canada, particularly Central Canada and Eastern Canada, because of economic imbalances whereby Alberta is a net over-contributor to the system of equalization payments in Canada. Furthermore, the majority of Alberta's trade flows north-south with the United States and not east-west with the rest of Canada.\n\nThe Alberta economy was traditionally based on agriculture, but in the last half of the 20th century it changed to become based on industrial resource extraction, mainly oil and gas production. Alberta's political culture in the late 20th century was generally dominated by both small-\"c\" and large-\"C\" conservative politics and economics, whereas the rest of Canada tended to favour more left-of-centre policies and parties.\n\nSeparatism emerged in the 1930s within the Social Credit Party, which formed the Government of Alberta after the 1935 election. The federal government deemed implementing a form of social credit unconstitutional and invoked its rarely used power of disallowance under S.56 of the Constitution Act, 1867, thereby voiding provincial legislation. Premier William Aberhart did secure provincially-owned banks and distribution of prosperity certificates most of which were openly against the Government. Premier Aberhart's followers called for separation from Canada, but Aberhart himself counselled moderation and rejected secession. The separatist movement was ridiculed by the media as a fringe movement of the uneducated.\n\nFollowing World War II, the popular \"Alberta First\" opposition was formed to combat wastage and excessive export of gas. Albertans in general felt that they have been denied their fair return and usage of their own resources, and that outsiders had benefited disproportionately. In 1949, Alberta responded by passing legislation to strengthen control over export of gas from the Province. Ottawa responded by invoking the military in order to pressure Alberta to export its gas to the US. By 1954, it was widely understood that predatory encroachments from outside monopolies were backed by the federal government, in opposition of Albertan interests.\n\nThe modern ideal for a separate Alberta nation began in the 1970s, as a response to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's pursuit of bilingualism and Multiculturalism in Canada, and the National Energy Program. These programs were seen by many Albertans as an attack on oil resources; the promotion of Liberal \"anti-Albertan\" values were viewed as a negative influence by many Albertans.\n\nIn 1974, as Quebeckers were discussing separating from Canada, many Albertans also began to consider separation. This resulted in some Calgary-based citizens forming the Independent Alberta Association. Central to the argument was the fact that Alberta would pay billions of dollars towards Canada, but without political representation equal to that of Central and Eastern Canada. Many expressed the opinion that Trudeau would continue his hard federalist stance producing unfavorable results for Western Canada including Alberta and its natural resources. Some, like Glenn Morrison, president of Renn Industries, did not agree with Alberta separatism but, believed strongly that Alberta needed increased representation in Ottawa and greater autonomy. In the end, the Independent Alberta Association did not move beyond association status, and did not form a political party.\n\nOther influences in the 1970s included two major oil crises: coinciding with the Yom-Kippur War of 1973 and the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The first was caused by the decision of the US to support Israel, which in turn caused retaliation by Egypt and Syria, bringing on an oil embargo that resulted in Alberta receiving substantially less price for oil than the global market prices dictated. Across North America, long lines could be seen at gas stations, and people started to realize the need to conserve energy resources.\n\nThe second oil crisis of 1979 was again due to decreased oil output, this time in the wake of the Iranian Revolution.\nIn 1978, a revolutionary anti-American government headed by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the America-friendly government of the Shah of Iran. Gasoline prices, which had earlier stabilized somewhat since 1973, spiked again. Some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a few similarly minded oil-rich nations had ceased all oil exports to the United States and countries that supported Israel. The price of oil sold to North America quadrupled within months, and service stations again ran out of fuel, long lines were evident at gas stations across North America.\n\nThe Alberta government and the Canadian federal government responded politically to address oil reserves and conservation of petroleum resources. In 1971, the Alberta Social Credit Party provincial government, headed by Harry Strom, created an environmental ministry, the first of its kind, with a mandate to manage and conserve Alberta's natural resources. Federally, in 1974, the Office of Energy Conservation was created. Conflict arose between Alberta and Canada after the 1973 crisis, over the management and distribution of Alberta's oil resources, and financial wealth, setting the stage for Alberta separatism.\n\nAfter Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in 1979 defeating Pierre Trudeau's Liberal party Albertans were hopeful a change in federal energy policy would occur. These ideas were harnessed during Clark's unsuccessful 1980 election campaign. An Albertan Clark lost the election and resigned the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1983 after receiving only a 67% confidence vote at a party convention.\n\nIn 1980, a Liberal majority government under Pierre Trudeau was formed. This caused the already brewing separatist movement in western Canada to attract thousands of people to rallies and coincided with the election of a separatist to the Alberta Legislature.\n\nIn October 1980, the National Energy Program (NEP) was created by the federal government under Prime Minister Trudeau, and support for Alberta separatism and anger toward the Federal Government reached a new level of popular support. This program was widely thought to be an attempt by the federal government to seize full control over Alberta's natural resources. Notably, Trudeau introduced a tax to finance the federally owned energy company Petro-Canada and gave grants to Canadian-owned companies to encourage exploration. After the introduction of the NEP, Alberta's oil industry slumped, with drastic reduction in the number of oil wells drilled. Abandonment of major projects such as Alsands caused high unemployment in Alberta. The Petroleum Incentives Program, part of the NEP, was criticized for luring exploration capital away from Alberta.\n\nTrudeau argued that the NEP would pave the way for Canada to become self-sufficient in energy but with the forced requirement of Alberta producers to sell domestically at a significant discount compared to world prices, which allowed the sponsored Petro-Canada the advantage in purchasing producing assets. Eastern Canadians would then be able to buy oil at below-market rates, and the federal government would have a view into an industry dominated by foreign owned petroleum companies. Trudeau argued that the NEP would help shield and promote self-sufficiency in Canada from the volatility of the international oil prices, but instead, economic disaster resulted. Alberta's unemployment rate rose from 4% to more than 10%, bankruptcies soared 150%, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers later blamed the NEP for the loss of 15,000 jobs, a 22% drop in drilling activity, and a 25% decline in exploration budgets. Industry cash flow and earnings fell from $4.7 billion in 1980 to $3.1 billion in 1981. Many prominent citizens were inspired to push forward Alberta separatist principles. This sentiment gave rise to the Western Canada Concept (WCC) and West-Fed which held popular, well-attended meetings across Alberta. Many of the people attracted to these parties were not necessarily advocating for independence, but were advocating for fair treatment of Alberta and her resources.\n\nIn 1980, Doug Christie, a British Columbia lawyer, formed the WCC in an effort to promote Western separatism. In 1982, Gordon Kesler was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election in Olds-Didsbury as a candidate of the WCC and attracted national attention.\n\nIn addition, an organization called West-Fed was founded, led by Edmonton businessman Elmer Knutson, who was credited with inspiring the transformation of Western alienation ideas into a political movement.\" Knutson denied being a separatist, but West-Fed was widely regarded as a separatist organization. In 1983, Knutson attempted, but failed, to win the leadership of the Social Credit Party of Canada. A year later in 1984, Knutson founded the Confederation of Regions Party to advocate for a new Canadian constitution that would provide Alberta with more regional autonomy. The Confederation of Regions Party of Canada (CoR) was based on the premise that Canada consists of four regions, each of which should have equal representation in Parliament. By mid-1983 it was registered as an official provincial party in Alberta and by 1984 it was registered federally and ran 54 candidates but none were elected. Major platform initiatives included opposition to compulsory bilingualism and metrication, abolishing the Senate, and equal representation to the four regions. A year later Knutson resigned, but in all had significantly inspired many Albertans to join Doug Christie's Western Canada Concept, which was running candidates in elections.\n\nIn a 1981 Alberta poll, 49% agreed that \"Western Canadians get so few benefits from being part of Canada that they might as well go it on their own.\" Across the west, polls indicated about 1/3 agreement to this statement. In 1982, 84% of western respondents agreed they are dissatisfied with the federal government, 50% held it responsible for their poor economic situation, and 66% responded they did not trust the federal government.\n\nIn response, Premier Peter Lougheed called a snap election in which the party nominated 78 candidates in the province's 79 ridings (electoral districts). Highlighted was major infighting and structural leadership problems within the WCC.\n\nAlthough WCC won almost 12% of the popular vote (over 111,000 votes), Kesler was defeated after changing ridings, and no other candidate was elected. The WCC still managed a strong third place showing in another by-election, in Spirit River-Fairview, held in 1985, following the death of Grant Notley.\n\nThe party's popularity declined after the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Brian Mulroney won a majority government, defeating Prime Minister John Turner in the 1984 federal election. Under Mulroney, the NEP was rapidly dismantled and as a Conservative, new hope reigned for Alberta in achieving a better negotiated resource wealth distribution. This caused the Alberta separatist movement to dissipate significantly. Yet, despite this sentiment, the Mulroney government was a disappointment since the majority of MPs were elected from central Canada, and Alberta's concerns largely ignored. By the time he left office in 1993, Mulroney was perhaps the most hated Prime Minister due to various allegations of corruption pertaining to the sale of Canadian assets. Mulroney awarded the contract for maintenance of CF-18 fighter jets to the Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace company, a decision that engendered so much anger in Western Canada, since Western Canada produced a better bid, that it directly led to the formation of the Reform Party of Alberta.\n\nAfter this, the WCC experienced a resurgence, and in 1987 ran candidate Jack Ramsay, who in 1982 had become leader of the party. Ramsay notably and significantly argued for the Triple-E Senate as an alternative to Alberta separation, until 1986 when he reverted his opinion back to the previous separatist position of the WCC. In 1987 Ramsay joined the Reform Party of Alberta and ran in a by-election where he finished second. This would be the last time the party would run a candidate.\n\nAlberta prominent citizen Preston Manning would take the Reform Party of Canada, a right-wing populist federal party, along the lines of non-separatist sentiments and significant popularity. Manning would attract many Albertans that were separatists. The Reform Party existed from 1987 to 2000 when it merged into the Canadian Alliance. Later, in 2003, it would merge with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada. These mergers left a significant void to those interested in furthering separatist principles.\n\nWithout the existence of the Reform Party to articulate Alberta's concerns, the separatist movement in the early twenty-first century began to organize meaningfully for the first time since the 1980s. Again though, separatism would place faith in a favourable federal government, only to again be disappointed.\n\nIn the 2004 federal election, the governing Liberal Party of Canada was returned with a minority government despite allegations of corruption. 61.7% of Alberta voters voted for the opposition Conservative Party - 22% supported the Liberals, although how many of these Conservative voters were separatist can only be guessed.\n\nThere was significant opposition within Alberta to the Kyoto Protocol as the Kyoto treaty was believed to have negative effects on the provincial economy, which is based to a large degree on the oil and gas industry. (Alberta had the world's second largest proven reserves of oil, behind only Saudi Arabia.)\n\nIn the 2004 general election, the Separation Party of Alberta nominated 12 candidates who won 4,680 votes, 0.5% of the provincial total. No candidates were elected. This was less support than the Alberta Independence Party attracted in the 2001 election, when 15 candidates attracted 7,500 votes.\n\nAlbertan Stephen Harper succeeded against the odds of the Canadian First-past-the-post voting system and in 2006 became Prime Minister of Canada in a minority government in the 2006 federal election. Harper had been a significant figure in the Reform Party, became leader of the Canadian Alliance in 2002, then merged with the PC Party in 2003, forming the Conservative Party of Canada. Due to Harper's Reform roots, Albertans held faith that he would be the trusted figure to protect Alberta's interests. As a result, Alberta's separatist movement sat on the side-lines, with uncertain prospects. Some pundits predicted that this result would cause support for separatism to ebb away.\n\nThe notion of Alberta secession from Canada gained sympathy from some figures within Alberta's conservative parties. Mark Norris, who was one of the contenders to succeed Ralph Klein as the Alberta premier, told the \"Calgary Sun\" in March 2006 that under his leadership, if a future federal government persisted in bringing in policies harmful to Alberta such as a carbon tax, \"(Alberta is) going to take steps to secede.\"\n\nAlso, some politicians believe, and at least one poll indicated that a much larger portion of the Alberta population may be at least sympathetic to the notion of secession than was indicated by election results. In January 2004, Premier Ralph Klein told the Canadian edition of \"Readers Digest\" that one in four Albertans were in support of separation. An August 2005 poll commissioned by the \"Western Standard\" pegged support for the idea that \"Western Canadians should begin to explore the idea of forming their own country.\" at 42% in Alberta and 35.6% across the four Western provinces\n\nSupport for Albertan separatism has increased significantly with the Canadian federal election victory of Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party on October 19, 2015. Federal Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, the son of Pierre Trudeau, became prime minister with a majority government, and re-inspired the Alberta separatist movement. While speaking at a town hall in Peterborough, Ontario, on January 13, 2017, Trudeau responded to a question about pipelines and his commitment to protecting Canada's environment. \"We can't shut down the oilsands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels. That is going to take time,\" The next day at a Calgary vs Edmonton Hockey game in Edmonton, Mr. Trudeau was loudly booed by the crowd. His unpopularity in Alberta is a significant rallying point for Alberta separatists. The topic of Alberta separating from Canada is the subject of a growing number mainstream media reports.\n\nPeter Zeihan in his 2014 book \"The Accidental Superpower\" presented the reasons why he believed both Alberta and the U.S. would benefit from Alberta joining the United States as the 51st state. Quote from page 263 of book:\n\nThe core issue is pretty simple. While the Québécois—and to a slightly lesser degree the rest of Canada—now need Alberta to maintain their standard of living, the Albertans now need \"not\" to be a part of Canada in order to maintain theirs.\n\nZeihan also stated that \"Right now, every man, woman and child in Alberta pays $6,000 more into the national budget than they get back. Alberta is the only province that is a net contributor to that budget — by 2020, the number will exceed $20,000 per person, $40,000 per taxpayer. That will be the greatest wealth transfer in per capita terms in the Western world.\" Per Statistics Canada, in 2015 Alberta paid $27 billion more into the federal treasury than it received back in services.\n\nA September 2018 poll by Ipsos indicated that 62% of Albertans believe that Alberta \"does not get its fair share from Confederation\" (up from 45% in 1997), 46% feel \"more attached to their province than to their country\" (up from 39% in 1997), 34% \"feel less committed to Canada than I did a few years ago\" (up from 22% in 1997), 18% believe \"the views of western Canadians are adequately represented in Ottawa\" (down from 22% in 2001), and 25% believe \"My province would be better off if it separated from Canada\" (up from 19% in 2001).\n\nA February 2019 poll from Angus Reid found 50% of Albertans would support secession from Canada but also found the likelihood that Alberta would separate to be \"remote.\"\n\nAfter Justin Trudeau's re-election on October 21, 2019, in the Canadian federal election, #Wexit (a wordplay on \"Brexit\", the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union) trended on social media. However, experts and an analysis from Hill+Knowlton Strategies, demonstrated that part of the push was due to disinformation and bots. On November 4, 2019, the separation group \"Wexit Alberta\" applied for federal political party status. On November 6, 2019, a poll conducted by Ipsos show a historic high of interest of secession from Canada in both Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces by 33% and 27%, respectively. On January 12, 2020, Wexit Canada was granted eligibility for then next federal election.\n\nA May 2020 poll by Northwest Research for the Western Standard found that 41% of respondents would support independence in a referendum, 50% would be opposed, and 9% weren't sure. Removing undecideds, 45% would support and 55% would be opposed. Respondents were also asked if they would support a referendum if \"the federal government is unwilling to negotiate with Alberta on a new constitutional arrangement\", 48% said yes, while 52% said no. Support for independence was higher outside of Alberta's two biggest cities, with Edmonton being the most opposed.\n\nIn Canada the Clarity Act, which has been approved by the Supreme Court of Canada, governs the process a province should follow to achieve separation. The first step is a province wide referendum with a clear question. The size of majority support required by referendum is not defined.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040038", "title": "Ori (Stargate)", "text": "Ori (Stargate)\n\nThe Ori are fictional characters in the science fiction television series \"Stargate SG-1\". They are a group of \"ascended\" beings who use their advanced technology and knowledge of the universe to attempt to trick non-ascended humans into worshipping them as gods.\n\nThey first appeared in the ninth season of \"Stargate SG-1\", replacing the Goa'uld as the show's primary antagonists. While the Goa'uld relied on stolen technology from other civilizations to pose as gods, the Ori also have paranormal abilities in addition to very advanced technology. As Ascended beings, they live on a higher plane of existence with great power and knowledge and are as close to being \"gods\" as any non-deific being can be.\nThe Ori fabricated a religion called Origin, which they use in an attempt to control non-ascended beings. The Ori also attempt to destroy any planets and civilizations that reject Origin.\n\nSince the eighth season of \"Stargate SG-1\" was intended to be the last, the producers finished it with the defeat of the Goa'uld and Replicators. When the Sci Fi Channel renewed the series, however, the producers had grown creatively tired of writing endings. Having had good experiences with the first season of \"Stargate Atlantis\", the producers hence decided to revamp the series in more fronts than just adding new characters by introducing new villains and new missions. Thus they considered the beginning of Season 9 as the pilot of a new show.\n\nSeason Nine was about wiping the slate clean and resetting the story to where \"Stargate SG-1\" was in its first season. The reason was that the SG-1 team was now winning every time, having already defeated the main enemies the previous season. Since \"SG-1\" had always been grounded in Earth mythology, the producers chose the King Arthur mythology for the new season as that had not been done before. Merlin as a famous magical figure was made an Ancient, leading to the Ancients' enemies named the Ori. The Ori are thus \"a natural extension of where the Ancient mythology had gone.\" Up until that point, the story of the Ancients had been kept at arm's length because the show was not about the aliens but \"human beings going out into this unexplored, fantastical universe.\" The producers also acknowledged that a premature full revelation of the Ancients would have caused their story to be less interesting.\n\nProducer Brad Wright believed the Ori are still within the overriding theme of Stargate, as they are \"aliens playing gods\" and \"false gods\" and the relationship between aliens as gods and ordinary human folk. The introduction of the Ori was to prepare the viewer for their invasion and overtaking that would take place later. The Ori also served as a challenge for the new heroes in the SG-1 team (Mitchell, Landry, Vala). The writers believed that new bad guys and new obstacles for the characters to overcome would make for a more interesting story.\n\nThe name \"Ori\" comes from the word \"Origin\", as in the origin of the Ancients. When executive producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of \"origin\", he retcon-invented the word \"Origin\" as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as \"how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?\" Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, it would be hard to present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the \"magic powers\" of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that \"it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do.\" Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as \"Stargate\" should \"first and foremost [...] entertain people\", he considered it representative of television and the media, \"mak[ing] people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box – whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people.\" For Cooper, \"the followers of the Ori were the interesting part\", and he \"wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that.\" Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting \"mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes.\" The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.\n\nCooper was concerned that the distinction between the Ori and the Ori's followers was often overlooked, and that the SG-1 team dealt with the followers, not the ascended gods. If, as \"The Shroud\" suggested, the Ori were actually destroyed by the Merlin's Ancient weapon, the real issue for the SG-1 teams became the followers. Brad Wright pointed to power corruption, and the catch of the Ori killing unbelievers.\n\nIn the original pitch for \"Beachhead\", Brad Wright had intended to let Ori build the Supergate and come through. It was then decided among the writers to only let the threat of the Ori come through the Priors, and wait for the Ori arrival until the end of the season.\n\nThe last ten minutes of \"Camelot\" should serve as a \"great, ominous harbinger of the foe\" SG-1 is up against. In Season 10, the Ori sweep through the Milky Way galaxy, forcing SG-1 to start from scratch again to find technology, resources, and allies to fight against them.\n\nIf \"Stargate SG-1\" had gone on, the producers would have considered the search for the Ark (of \"\") as the overriding story for an eleventh season, similar to the Sangraal in seasons nine and ten. The producers did not explore more detailed ideas after the show's cancellation.\n\nArt director James Robbins developed the design of the Ori and the Priors from scratch. At the beginning, he knew a basic description of them and their powers, and that they would carry a staff weapon. The art department first looked at Japanese and Samurai from a costuming point of view. Inspired by remote jungle tribes for the mystical aspects, Robbins came up with the idea of scarification for the Priors and the Doci. The Priors have scarifications on the chin and the cheek, while the Doci also have them on their forehead. Scarification would therefore be a symbol of high establishment. Originally, it was also considered to have scarification on the hands, and to have the Priors have finger extensions, but this became impracticable. When the Prime Jaffa Gerak became a Prior in \"The Fourth Horseman\", his golden Jaffa tattoo on his forehead was replaced with a Prior scarification, and his makeup was made to look like the gold had melted and become part of his Prior scarification.\n\nEach Prior was given his own unique symbol, which he would wear on his wardrobe and also on his staff weapon. The art department built each staff to have a little orb encased in natural wood, and the orbs start to glow when the actor pushes a little button on the handle.\n\nComposer Joel Goldsmith's inspiration for the Ori themes were the \"certain parallels to what's happening today, in modern day\". He admits that the music of the Ori was intentionally given a gothic, Gregorian and Christian feel. He tried to meld a few different styles.\n\nThe Ori backstory is elaborate and is explained over Season 9 and 10 and the film \"\". Robert C. Cooper considered the backstory \"pretty complicated\" but felt the show gave the answers to the audience members who wanted to delve deeper.\n\nPart of this story returns to the Ancients, whose backstory began in the Season 1 episode \"The Torment of Tantalus\". Early in Season 9, Brad Wright explained that the Ori are the original Ancients, who would disagree with the Alterans (later to relocate and be known as the Ancients of the Milky Way galaxy) that they shouldn't interfere because interference would mean playing god, which these beings hadn't quite achieved.\n\nThe Ori and the Alterans were one race millions of years ago and lived in a single society on an evolutionary path to ascension. \"The Ark of Truth\" shows flashbacks to human Ancients coexisting with the people who eventually became the Ori. However, a philosophical division emerged. The Ori grew more and more fervent in their religious belief, while the Alterans adopted a more scientific/rational outlook to become a more progressive society. The Ancients were well known for their fierce belief in free will and had a code to be \"fairly non-violent\". As such, they do not interfere on lower planes of existence at all, not even to save their own kind from being exterminated by the Ori, or to prevent all life in the Milky Way galaxy from being exterminated by Anubis. In contrast, the Ori constantly interfere. For example, Origin states that failure to share the secrets of the universe to those on the lower planes of existence is an evil act and that anyone not following it must be eliminated; by this definition, every ascended Ancient was evil and must be destroyed. They also have no rules against taking direct control of living beings or completely changing them to behave as they desire. With the Ori outnumbering the Alterans, their viewpoints ultimately diverged so much that the two groups split apart and began to actively oppose each other, with the Ori attempting to kill the Alterans.\n\nTheir fundamentally different beliefs in regards to science led the Alterans to hide their level of scientific belief so that they would not get into a conflict. Eventually, the Ancients decided to build a space ship and leave rather than to use their technology, like the Ark of Truth, to defeat the Ori. Though they had the ability to stop the Ori, they thought it to be philosophically and morally wrong. The film thus addresses the non-interference policy of the Ancients under the Ori threat, and how they act millions of years later, when SG-1 succeeds in killing the Ori.\n\nAfter much time, believed by Daniel Jackson to be thousands of years, the Alterans discovered the Milky Way, where they eventually seeded with life and built their empire. However, even after the Ori had forced the Alterans to leave their galaxy, the two factions remained bitter enemies. Eventually, the Alterans were afflicted with a terrible plague that wiped out most of their civilization and forced them to relocate again. It would later be discovered that what was known of this plague is very similar to the disease used by Ori Priors against non-believers, which had led Daniel Jackson to speculate that the pre-Ascended Ori might have been responsible for this plague.\n\nAfter millions of years, both the Alterans and the Ori learned how to ascend and evolved, forming two groups that continued to oppose each other, even at the higher planes of existence. According to the Orici Adria, the Ori-Ancient war on the Ascended plane is due to the Ancients' intolerance for those who do not comply with their rules about non-interference. According to Orlin, a de-ascended Ancient, the conflict arises from the Ori's ultimate wish to destroy the Ancients once and for all as they seek to eliminate all who oppose them.\n\nWhen the Ori ascended they re-created humanity (the second generation of humans) to worship them in the Ori galaxy, and gave their followers the knowledge and technology to essentially enslave others and to force them to believe as the Ori desired. The Ancients shielded the humans in the Milky Way, preventing the Ori from finding out about them and enslaving the people to Origin as they had in their own galaxy. They do not view this action as a violation of their non-interference policies as the Ori are at a level equal to themselves. However, as the Ancients will not interfere in the lower planes of existence, the Ori are allowed to send their human followers to the Milky Way in order to convert it, and anyone who wishes to worship the Ori will not be prevented from doing so.\n\nAccording to Orlin, ascended beings can be empowered by massive numbers of humans worshipping them. The Ori fabricated an entire religion, Origin, based on the false promise of ascension in order to take power from their followers. The Ancients refrain from interfering in the lower planes of existence because manipulating and aligning lower life forms could result in exactly this type of corruption. According to the Ancient Myrddin, the Ori had the best intentions when they began. Even after the Ori were destroyed, their followers and Priors continued acting in their name to oppress thousands of people since, for the most part, they were ignorant to the demise of their \"Gods\".\n\nThe Ori impose a religion called Origin on sentient beings, promising a guide towards enlightenment that is also known in the series as Ascension. The faith comes with a holy book called The Book of Origin, and the Priors spread the Word of Origin. \"The Book of Origin\" contains tales of how the followers of the Ori returned to the path to enlightenment, and thus achieved Ascension, although some skeptics consider these merely \"fables meant to fill a soul bereft of hope with purpose\". Several lines from the \"Book of Origin\", or otherwise repeated mantras, are heard on the show. These include variations of \"Hallowed are the Ori\". The central icon of this religion is fire, something that gives off light and warmth. The fact that on Earth this icon has some evil or Satanic associations in many modern religions prompted Daniel to posit that the Ancients had influenced this negative connotation in order to identify the threat the Ori pose. Among the populations of natives in the Ori home galaxy are groups of heretics who believe they are being suppressed, and seek to discover forbidden historical knowledge to show others that the Ori, despite their power, are not gods.\n\nOri military tactics varied during the initial incursions into the Milky Way galaxy and the full-scale invasion that was later achieved through the Supergate. The initial incursions were achieved through lone Priors who were sent to worlds in the Milky Way galaxy, preaching to the populace and distributing copies of the Book of Origin. When the people failed to comply, more drastic measures were taken, eventually to the point of destroying the population. The show features powerful Ori weapons in \"Ethon\", ships in \"Camelot\", control chairs like that in \"Counterstrike\" and Supergates in \"Beachhead\". The Ori can be killed by Merlin's Sangraal weapon, which nullifies ascended beings. As seen in \"The Ark of Truth\", there is also an Ark that Cooper considered \"a truly fascinating centerpiece\" and \"mass brain-washing device\" which causes people to see the truth in any given situation. Comparing the Ark to television as it is \"a box that light comes out of, and you believe what it says\", Cooper left it open whether the choice to do it without guns was ultimately the better method.\n\nThe Doci (Latin \"docere\", \"to teach\"), played by Julian Sands, represents the Ori in their home galaxy and leads the Priors. He appears in \"Origin\", \"The Fourth Horseman, Part 1\" and \"\". The Doci is essentially a chief Prior who acts as a mediator or mouthpiece for the Ori. The Doci has brown hair and colored eyes, pale skin and facial markings of a Prior. The Doci was introduced in \"Origin\", where he was shown to reside in the city of Celestis, with his chambers next to the Ori's \"Flames of Enlightenment\". In one instance, the Ori possessed the Doci to speak to Daniel. Had Julian Sands not been able to come back as the Doci for the direct-to-DVD film \"The Ark of Truth\", the producers had planned to hire another actor as a different Doci in charge in Celestis. Although Sands' availability eventually was a hindrance in \"The Ark of Truth\", the producers felt it was better to include the Doci than to forgo the character.\n\nThe Ori are served by so-called Priors, highly evolved human beings who act as missionaries of the Ori by traveling to different planets to spread the religion of Origin. As the Ori are incapable of directly affecting the material universe in the Milky Way Galaxy due to the protection of the ascended Ancients, they send the Priors as their representatives to circumvent this rule. Cooper said the Priors have \"these incredible, superhuman powers\", which allows them to perform deeds which they convince people are miracles, attack enemies, and resurrect the dead. They also unleash plagues as punishment for not following the Ori. The Priors believe fervently in their mission, and essentially offer a real religion with big promises. Priors have been encountered on various worlds, trying to convert the local population and fight anyone who tried to stop them, including the Tau'ri and the Jaffa.\n\nAs shown in the series, priors are normal humans whom the Ori transform into an evolved state of human to serve as missionaries as a reward for loyalty and devoted service. This process drastically alters their appearance: albino skin and hair, a tracery of raised lines on the chin and cheeks, and indentation of the skull just above and behind the eyes. Their eyes appear as a misty gray pupil without an iris. In \"The Fourth Horseman\" and , SG-1 was able to temporarily disable a Prior's abilities by using ultrasonic sounds to deny Priors access to the advanced areas of their brains.\n\n\nThe Ori warriors are conscripted men, who were trained to fight non-believers as foot soldiers and take over the Milky Way. Introduced in \"Crusade\", they are shown wearing metallic plate armor and armed with powerful staff weapons. They are first seen in combat in Season 10. Cooper wrote \"Crusade\" with the intention to show that the Ori warriors are not two-dimensional, even though their strength of belief and single-mindedness makes them fight for what they want to fight for. According to Cooper, the Ori warriors are a fictional mirror of the events in the real world, but he wanted people to try and understand \"why people want to go to war with us, or blow up our buildings, or our airplanes\". Cooper also wanted to show that \"there's really no winner to the argument\" when it comes to \"religion and belief, and gods\"; according to Cooper, there is a line when a society takes up arms instead of finding a more civilized way of dialogue.\n\nTim Guinee played Tomin, a devout Ori follower of the village of Ver Isca, who becomes an Ori commander in Season 10. He appears in \"Crusade\", \"Flesh and Blood\", \"Line in the Sand\", and \"\". Tomin is intended as a representation of the Ori warriors, and Cooper described Guinee as a \"fabulous actor who instantly creates that humanity and empathy ... while he's mass-murdering people\" Tomin is introduced in flashbacks in \"Crusade\", having found Vala after she was transported to the Ori home galaxy. Tomin had been crippled since childhood, and was therefore looked down on by his fellow villagers. Tomin married Vala and accepted her pregnancy as his child, not knowing that it was a miraculous conception set by the Ori. A little later, a Prior visited the village and cured Tomin of his limp, allowing him to become a warrior for the Ori. The prior also told Tomin the truth about the child as \"the will of the Ori\", who would later be the Orici. Tomin is later able to forgive Vala. Tomin and Vala depart aboard the first wave of Ori vessels entering the Milky Way, and they go separate ways in \"Flesh and Blood\". Tomin rises to the rank of commander within the Ori warrior armies, and he and Vala meet again in \"Line in the Sand\". Because a Prior twists the words of the Book of Origin, Tomin begins to doubt the Priors and their interpretations of Origin's teachings, and helps Vala escape. Tomin plays an important role in the film \"\", in which, after seeing a Prior's death with his own eyes, he learns the truth about the Ori.\n\nIn Season 10, the primary antagonist switched from the Priors and the Doci to the Orici, also known by the name Adria. The story presents her as a genetically advanced human infused with Ori knowledge, created to circumvent the Ancients' rules that the Ori cannot directly use their powers to conquer the Milky Way galaxy. Adria is one step higher than the Doci, but equal in terms of her role in the Milky Way galaxy, which is to lead the armies of the Ori in the Milky Way galaxy, converting the galaxy to Origin in the process. Adria possesses several Prior-like superhuman abilities, and leads the armies of the Ori until her Ascension in the penultimate episode of \"Stargate SG-1\". From a creative standpoint, Adria's character was created to give Vala Mal Doran a story and personality arc as a member of the SG-1 team.\n\nAdria's story begins shortly after the events of \"Beachhead\", when Vala is impregnated by the Ori in the Ori home galaxy. Vala eventually returns to the Milky Way aboard one of the Ori battlecruisers invading the Milky Way galaxy. In \"Flesh and Blood\", Vala gives birth to a baby girl, the Orici. Within hours of being born, the child reaches the apparent age of four and heals her mother's pain, knowing that Vala is not a believer in Origin. By the child's apparent age of seven, Vala gives her the name Adria, after her stepmother, a \"witch of a woman\". Vala escapes when Adria is at the apparent age of twelve. Adria only starts to have an impact in the second quarter of the season, when she has grown \"into a beautiful but deadly young woman\".\n\nWhen Vala, who has joined the SG-1 team, meets adult Adria in \"Counterstrike\", Adria foreshadows her plans with Daniel. In \"The Quest\", Adria tricks SG-1 into obtaining the Sangraal for her. Adria captures Daniel before he can complete the device. Hoping to convert both Earth and Vala, Adria attempts to convert Daniel to the path of Origin and makes him a Prior. In \"The Shroud\", however, Daniel betrays her and uses the weapon on the Ori galaxy. In \"Dominion\", Adria is briefly implanted with a cloned Ba'al symbiote. Although the symbiote is removed, the procedure almost kills Adria and she ascends. Being the only surviving Ori after the events of \"The Shroud\", Adria alone controls the power generated by the followers of Origin – becoming the closest thing the \"Stargate\" universe has seen to a true god. She continues the Ori's assault on the Milky Way in \"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\". After an Ancient device known as the Ark of Truth affects her galaxy's believers, Adria is last seen in \"\" in a battle with the Ancient Morgan le Fay, which in Cooper's view started as a fight in the human realm of existence and continues on the ascended level similar to what happened with Anubis and Oma Desala in \"Threads\". Adria is thus \"eternally distracted from being able to continue her evil ways\".\n\nYoung Adria was played by three child actresses – Adria at age four was played by Robert C. Cooper's daughter Emma, who replaced the originally cast child who suffered from stage fright. Adria at age seven was played by Jodelle Ferland, and at age twelve by Brenna O'Brien. Morena Baccarin was offered the role of adult Adria in a phone call by the producers, who were \"Firefly\" fans. The orange contact lenses that the actress had to wear made her feel nearly blind and irritated her eyes, so the lenses were dropped during the shooting of \"The Quest\". Baccarin enjoyed \"the whole experience [...] incredible\" as she got to play a character she could learn from. In her words, \"Adria was a complex character and I loved trying to make her sweet as well as totally bad.\" Brad Wright called Adria \"an interesting character because she's the Ori cheating\", and compared her to the Ori equivalent of a Harcesis. Cooper considered Adria becoming host to a Goa'uld \"the marriage of the old villains and the new villains\" and compared it to the episode \"Enemies\", the first where both the Replicators and the Goa'uld first appeared together. Morena Baccarin was only available for one day during the filming of \"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\", worth six pages of script. Cooper had written more scenes between her, Julian Sands (\"Doci\") and the SG-1 team, but the only other option to what ended up in the film was to cut the character.\n\nIn the second episode of season 9, it is shown that not all Humans in the Ori Home Galaxy believe their gods to be benevolent as is seen in the case of the Anti-Ori Underground. This group of humans live a dangerous life in hiding from purges and the fanatical followers. Their purpose is simply to collect enough evidence to prove to their brethren that the claims of the Ori are false. Despite this, they do believe that the Ori are very powerful; it is only their intentions they doubt. Even though the group lives in the shadows of Ori society, they have collected a number of artifacts that they have kept hidden, since such pieces of technology contradict the book of Origin and thus would be destroyed if discovered. The group also has a number of followers in high positions even within the City of the Gods. All known members of this movement – Harrid (played by Stephen Park), Sallis (April Amber Telek), Fannis (Paul Moniz de Sa), Seevis (Michael Ironside), and Denya (Daniella Evangelista) – die shortly after their introduction. Another member is introduced in Stargate: The Ark of Truth: Hertis (Chris Gauthier). Tomin somehow finds him and takes him to meet with Daniel and Vala in order to find the location of Ortus Malum where the team believes the Ark of Truth to be. He is somewhat suspicious of Daniel and Vala as they are unaware that the fires of Celestis are out (an indication that the Ori are dead) which should have spread very far. Apparently Tomin told him they were from far away but just not \"how\" far (another galaxy). In order to give him proof of their story, Daniel, Vala and Tomin take him to the \"Odyssey\" which is in orbit which is proof enough for him. He tells them what is believed to be the location: a mountain high above the Plains of Celestis on another planet. Presumably he is then returned to his home planet as he is not seen again.\n\nIn reviewing the first part of Season 9, Steven Graves of \"TV Zone\" was concerned that \"mining Arthurian mythology for season 9 may prove to be a mistake for \"Stargate\"\", comparing scenes of \"Avalon\" to \"a god-awful Merri Olde England pastiche straight out of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", complete with unwashed peons, an overbearing church and witch-burning.\" He however commented about \"Origin\" that \"\"Stargate SG-1\" seems to be establishing an interesting set of themes this season, providing a timely commentary on religious evangelism and intolerance with its new villains, the Ori.\" By \"The Powers That Be\", Graves was sure that \"the Ori are a force to be reckoned with.\" Regarding \"The Fourth Horseman\", he thought it was \"doubly nice\" to see an \"SG-1\" story where the apocalyptic events have an effect on contemporary Earth instead of on alien planets.\n"}

{"id": "2040051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040051", "title": "Barry Tourist Railway", "text": "Barry Tourist Railway\n\nThe Barry Tourist Railway (formerly the Barry Island Railway) is a railway developed to attract visitors to Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. It is a key element of the Barry Rail Centre which also includes engineering and training facilities.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the railway is that for several hundred yards across the Causeway from Barry to Barry Island, the trackbed used is directly alongside the Network Rail track which uses the original up line, with the Barry Tourist Railway using the down line. This continues from Barry to cross the Causeway and 149-yard Barry Island viaduct after which the two lines diverge into separate platforms at Barry Island. The Railway does not consider itself a line but more of a network as it has two different routes. This is reflected in the map below, with Network Rail shown in red.\n\nIn November 2008, the landowner the Vale of Glamorgan Council, undertook a commercial tender exercise, which terminated the lease of previous operator the Vale of Glamorgan Railway in favour of a private operator, Cambrian Transport under a 20-year-long lease. Operations commenced in December 2009 and a full year's programme of services operated during 2010. Details are shown on the Council website. Services have been operated by IRIS II DMU (Class 101 twin-set), Class 26 No. 26 038, Class 73s 73 118 & 73 133 with a former Gatwick Express coaching stock set in push-pull mode, Class 20 20 228, Class 08 08 503, 0-6-0 Pannier Tank locomotive No. 9466, Great Western Steam Rail Motor No.93, Metropolitan Tank No.1, Hunslet 0-6-0T Jessie and an 8F tender loco.\n\nIn 1979, the Butetown Historic Railway Society was formed in Cardiff, running a service along a short section of line from Bute Road Station northwards towards Queen St Station. Evicted by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, the company was offered a lease by the Vale of Glamorgan Council on Barry Island Railway Station, with financial aid from the Welsh Development Agency.\n\nFollowing the December 2007 decision by landlords, the Vale of Glamorgan Council not to renew the £65,000 per annum funding of the Barry Island Railway, the society maintained its services but subsequently the Council decided to put the railway site out to tender under a long-term lease. There were three sealed bids submitted with the successful bidder being the commercial company, Cambrian Transport, who had been the Council's railway adviser and contractor since the Barry Railway Project started.\n\nThe other bidder NEWCO was submitted by Graham Lee – owner of the LH Plant, Hunslet Engine Company, Statfold Barn Railway – and Mike Thomson – owner of 'Arrowvale' who make \"black boxes\" for the rail industry. NEWCO had spoken to the VGR in advance and agreed a method of working together.\n\nCambrian Transport have operated the railway at Barry since December 2009. It currently operates the line over 30 days per annum and runs many special events. The biggest annual event for the last 3 years has been the \"Barry at War\" Weekend, which attracts many thousands of visitors to the town. In August 2014, Cambrian Transport sponsored a display by the Red Arrows and a fly-past by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight during this event, bringing more people to Barry Island than for many years.\n\nSanta Special trains are also popular during the Christmas period.\n\nThe Barry Tourist Railway is centred at Barry Island railway station and platforms, which is shared with Arriva Trains Wales services. The station is maintained by Cambrian Transport and there is a shop, café and military museum as well as space for event displays and activities. At the west or 'Cardiff' end of the building, is the end of the Network Rail main platform 1 area. Access to the Barry Tourist Railway's used bay platform 4 and part of bay platform 3 (unused and having no track), is at the pier (east) end of the station. An unused section of Platform 1 and also having no track, runs to a point from the east end of the station building towards the Barry Island (or Pier) tunnel. The Barry Island Railway line exits the east end of the station and runs to Plymouth Road where a museum is to be developed. A short canopied platform at the museum building allows visitors to alight and see historic artefacts and exhibits when established whilst a DMU driver changes ends or steam-hauled trains have to run-around. In the past, certain trains ran through Barry Island station and a 280-yard tunnel to Barry Pier to connect with P&A Campbell's paddle steamer sailings in the Bristol Channel. At the moment the tunnel is blocked off and used as a shooting range. The former single track falling at 1 in 80 to the tunnel was lifted after 1976 and the inclined trackbed now serves as a metalled access road to the tunnel. The railway has long-term ambitions to reopen the tunnel and route to Barry Pier.\n\nHeading west from Barry Island station, the Barry Tourist Railway's single line crosses the 149-yard Barry Island double-line viaduct shared with Network Rail, before making a tight right-hand curve and splitting into two branches, one dropping down to Hood Road, (the Waterfront) the first section to be opened on a totally new inclined formation, the other heading past the former Barry Railway Co's steam shed and on to Woodham Halt and thence to the new terminus at Gladstone Bridge adjacent to Morrison's supermarket and a retail centre. It is intended to extend the line a further half mile to a site alongside Arriva Trains Wales’ Barry Docks Station, where an interchange will be provided and where by 2013, a Park & Ride facility had been provided.\n\nThe running line runs near to the site of the former Woodham Brothers scrapyard which by April 2015 was under intense development as a new housing complex and by 13 April 2015, a new ASDA superstore had been built and opened, all on the site of what was known in railway terms as 'West Pond' before being completely backfilled. The Waterfront terminus is alongside the old Barry Railway Co's Hood Road goods shed and also conveniently situated near a new Premier Inn and Brewers Fayre establishment opened in 2014 at the south-western end of Barry No.1 dock. The Waterfront platform and terminus also lies opposite the old Barry Railway Co's Hydraulic pumphouse and electrical generating building, now a listed structure and as at August 2015, was undergoing extensive internal and external refurbishment and bore vertically lettered identities placed on two sides of its taper square chimney, one face stating PUMPHOUSE and the other TY PWMP, but the correct circumflex above the letter Y has been omitted. The former Barry Railway Co's Loco shed at Barry, opened in 1888 and at the GWR 1922 grouping, stabled 148 engines, all re-numbered by the GWR. As at September 1947 and nationalisation of the railways, Barry shed had a complement of 85 steam locomotives. It closed to steam engines in September 1964. Before being taken over by the Vale of Glamorgan Council in the 1990s, the shed and outbuildings had finally served as an EWS wagon repair centre but is now the main running shed and is also used to store and repair rolling stock. This site has recently been renamed Barry Main Depôt by Cambrian Transport.\n\nSome parts of the line, particularly around the Plymouth Road/Barry Island and Barry Town area, were used for several scenes in the \"Doctor Who\" episodes \"The Empty Child\" and \"The Doctor Dances\" in January 2005 and more recently for the episode \"Flatline\" screened in October 2014. Other recent filming includes \"Being Human\", \"Ar-y-Tracs\" and \"Stella (UK TV series)\" – the last two featuring Ruth Jones.\n\nBy July 2014, the Network Rail connection to the BTR infrastructure at Barry was completely remodelled, coincident with the commissioning of the new Network Rail re-signalling project and closure of Barry signal box, the latter being demolished on the weekend of 28–29 March 2015.\n\nStock marked with an asterisk (*) is located at the Barry Main Depôt. On most running days, guided shed tours are offered by the railway.\n\nSteam locomotives \n\nThe last locomotives to leave Dai Woodham's scrapyard, were the remains of the vast number of locomotives left when the yard closed – and as there were ten of them, were a group often called the Barry Ten. Most of them have been removed for use in heritage railway projects and for restoration elsewhere. All but two of the Barry Ten steam locomotives remain on the railway (2015), though they were rejoined by a third member in 2014, and are publicly viewable on most operating days. They comprise an 0-6-2 Collett tank engine and a 2-10-0 tender locomotive, both partly disassembled. \n\n\n\nAlso on site are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOther rolling stock includes:-\n\n\nThe plan is to acquire further wagons to make up two rakes of wagons – one vacuum-braked and one air-braked set.\n"}

{"id": "2040058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040058", "title": "Valley of Mexico", "text": "Valley of Mexico\n\nThe Valley of Mexico () is a highlands plateau in central Mexico roughly coterminous with present-day Mexico City and the eastern half of the State of Mexico. Surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, the Valley of Mexico was a centre for several pre-Columbian civilizations, including Teotihuacan, the Toltec, and the Aztec. The ancient Aztec term \"Anahuac (Land Between the Waters) \" and the phrase Basin of Mexico are both used at times to refer to the Valley of Mexico. The Basin of Mexico became a well known site that epitomized the scene of early Classic Mesoamerican cultural development as well.\n\nThe Valley of Mexico is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.\nThe valley contains most of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, as well as parts of the State of Mexico, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, and Puebla. The Valley of Mexico can be subdivided into four basins, but the largest and most-studied is the area that contains Mexico City. This section of the valley in particular is colloquially referred to as the \"Valley of Mexico\".\nThe valley has a minimum elevation of above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over . It is an enclosed valley with no natural outlet for water to flow and a gap to the north where there is a high mesa but no high mountain peaks. Within this vulnerable watershed all the native fishes were extinct by the end of the 20th century. Hydrologically, the valley has three features. The first feature is the lakebeds of five now-extinct lakes, which are located in the southernmost and largest of the four sub-basins. The other two features are piedmont, and the mountainsides that collect the precipitation that eventually flows to the lake area. These last two are found in all four of the sub-basins of the valley. Today, the Valley drains through a series of artificial canals to the Tula River, and eventually the Pánuco River and the Gulf of Mexico. Seismic activity is frequent here, and the valley is considered an earthquake-prone zone.\n\nThe valley has been inhabited for at least 12,000 years, attracting humans with its mild climate (average temperatures between 12 and 15 °C, or 54 and 59 °F), abundant game and ability to support large-scale agriculture. Civilizations that have arisen in this area include the Teotihuacan (800 BC to 800 AD) the Toltec Empire (10th to 13th century) and the Aztec Empire (1325 to 1521). When the Spaniards arrived in the Valley of Mexico, it had one of the highest population concentrations in the world with about one million people. After the Conquest, the Spaniards rebuilt the largest and most dominant city here, Tenochtitlan, renaming it Mexico City. The valley used to contain five lakes called Lake Zumpango, Lake Xaltocan, Lake Xochimilco, Lake Chalco, and the largest, Texcoco covering about of the valley floor, but as the Spaniards expanded Mexico City, they began to drain the lakes' waters to control flooding. Although violence and disease significantly lowered the population of the valley after the Conquest, by 1900 it was again over one million people. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen an explosion of population in the valley along with the growth of industry. Since 1900, the population has doubled every fifteen years. Today, around 21 million people live in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area which extends throughout almost all of the valley into the states of Mexico and Hidalgo.\n\nThe growth of a major urban, industrial centre in an enclosed basin has created significant air and water quality issues for the valley. Wind patterns and thermal inversions trap contaminants in the valley. Over-extraction of ground water has caused new flooding problems for the city as it sinks below the historic lake floor. This causes stress on the valley's drainage system, requiring new tunnels and canals to be built.\n\nThe Valley of Mexico attracted prehistoric humans because the region was rich in biodiversity and had the capacity of growing substantial crops. Generally speaking, humans in Mesoamerica, including central Mexico, began to leave a hunter-gatherer existence in favor of agriculture sometime between the end of the Pleistocene epoch and the beginning of the Holocene. The oldest known human settlement in the Valley of Mexico is located in Tlapacoya, located on what was the edge of Lake Chalco in the southeast corner of the valley in contemporary Mexico State. There is reliable archeological evidence to suggest that the site dates as far back as 12,000 BC. After 10,000 BC, the number of artifacts found increases significantly. There are also other early sites such as those in Tepexpan, Los Reyes Acozac, San Bartolo Atepehuacan, Chimalhuacán and Los Reyes La Paz but they remain undated. Human remains and artifacts such as obsidian blades have been found at the Tlapacoya site that have been dated as far back as 20,000 BC, when the valley was semi-arid and contained species like camels, bison and horses that could be hunted by man. However, the precise dating of these artifacts has been disputed.\n\nGiant Columbian mammoths once populated the area, and the valley contains the most extensive mammoth kill sites in Mexico. Most of the sites are located on what were the shores of Lake Texcoco in the north of the Federal District and the adjacent municipalities of Mexico State such as in Santa Isabel Ixtapan, Los Reyes Acozac, Tepexpan and Tlanepantla. Mammoth bones are still occasionally found in farmland here. They have been discovered in many parts of the Federal District itself, particularly during the construction of the city's Metro lines and in the neighborhoods of Del Valle in the center, Lindavista to the center-north and Coyoacán in the south of the city. The symbol for Line 4's Talisman station of the Mexico City Metro is a mammoth, due to the fact that so many bones were uncovered during its construction. However, the richest site for mammoth remains in the valley is at the Paleontological Museum in Tocuila, a site located near the town of Texcoco in Mexico State. Although there is some evidence around the old lakeshores that the first populations here survived by hunting, gathering and possibly by scavenging, evidence from this time period is scarce.\n\nTlatilco was a large pre-Columbian village and culture in the Valley of Mexico situated near the modern-day town of the same name in the Mexican Federal District. It was one of the first significant population centers to arise in the valley, flourishing on the western shore of Lake Texcoco during the Middle Pre-Classic period, between 1200 BC and 200 BC. It was originally classified as a necropolis when it was first excavated, but it was determined that the many burials there were under houses of which nothing remains. It was then classified as a major chiefdom center. The Tlatilcans were an agricultural people growing beans, amaranth, squash and chili peppers, reaching their peak from 1000 to 700 BC.\n\nThe next-oldest confirmed civilization is in the far south of the valley and is called Cuicuilco. This archaeological site is located where Avenida Insurgentes Sur crosses the Anillo Periférico in the Tlalpan borough of the city. The old settlement once extended far beyond the boundaries of the current site, but it is buried under lava from one of the volcanic eruptions that led to its demise, and much of the modern city is built over this lava. The settlement was located where an old river delta used to form in the valley with waters from Mount Zacatépetl located in what is now the Tlalpan Forest. Cuicuilco was believed to have reached city status by 1200 BC and began to decline around 100 BC - AD 150. However, even though the ceremonial pyramid was abandoned, the site remained a location to leave offerings up to AD 400, although lava from the nearby Xitle volcano completely covered it.\n\nAround 2,000 years ago, the Valley of Mexico became one of the world's most densely populated areas and has remained so since. After the decline of Cuicuilco, the population concentration shifted north, to the city of Teotihuacan and later to Tula, both outside the lake's region of the valley. Teotihuacan became an organized village around 800 BC but it was around 200 BC that it began to reach its height. When it did, the city had approximately 125,000 inhabitants and covered of territory. It was dedicated primarily to the obsidian trade and at its peak was an important religious center and pilgrimage for the valley. In the early 8th century, with the rise of the Toltec empire, Teotihuacan ceased to be a major urban centre and the population shifted to Tollan or Tula on the northern front of Valley of Mexico.\n\nAfter the end of the Toltec empire in the 13th century and the decline of the city of Tula, the population shifted once again, this time to the lakes region of the valley. With this migration came the concept of a city-state based on the Toltec model. By the end of the 13th century, some fifty small urban units, semi-autonomous and with their own religious centers, had sprung up around the lakeshores of the valley. These remained intact with a population of about 10,000 each under Aztec rule and survived into the colonial period. All of these city-states, including the largest and most powerful, Tenochtitlan, with more than 150,000 inhabitants, claimed descent from the Toltecs. None of these cities was completely autonomous or self-sufficient, resulting in a conflictive political situation, and a complex system of agriculture in the valley. These city-states had similar governmental structures based on the need to control flooding and store water for irrigating crops. Many of the institutions created by these hydraulic societies, such as the building and maintenance of chinampas, aqueducts and dikes, were later co-opted by the Spanish during the colonial period.\n\nThe largest and most dominant city at the time of the Spanish conquest was Tenochtitlan. It was founded by the Mexica (Aztecs) on a small island in the western part of Lake Texcoco in 1325, and was extended with the use of chinampas, human-made extensions of agricultural land into the southern lake system, to increase productive agricultural land, covering about . The inhabitants controlled the lake with a sophisticated system of dikes, canals and sluices. Much of the surrounding land in the valley was terraced and farmed as well, with a network of aqueducts channeling fresh water from springs in the mountainsides into the city itself. Despite being the dominant power, the need to rely on resources from other parts of the valley led to the Aztec Triple Alliance between Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan at the beginning of the empire. However, by the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, Tenochtitlan had become the dominant power of the three, causing grievances that the Spaniards were able to exploit. However, despite Tenochtitlan's power outside the valley, it never completely controlled all of the valley itself, with the altepetl of Tlaxcala the most prominent example.\n\nBy 1520, the estimated population of the valley was over 1,000,000 people.\n\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire in 1521, the Spanish rebuilt and renamed Tenochtitlan as Mexico City. They started with essentially the same size and layout as the Aztec city but as the centuries progressed, the city grew as the lakes shrank. Just after the conquest, disease and violence had decreased the population in the valley, especially of the native peoples, but after that, the population grew all through the colonial period and in the century after independence.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the population of Mexico City alone had risen to over one million people. A population explosion began early in the 20th century, with the population of the city itself doubling approximately every 15 years since 1900, partly attributed to the fact that the federal government has favored development of the metropolitan area over other areas of the country. This has spurred investment in infrastructure for the city, such as electricity, other power sources, water supply and drainage. These have attracted businesses which in turn have attracted more population. Since the 1950s, urbanization has spread out from beyond the bounds of the Federal District to the surrounding jurisdictions, especially to the north into the State of Mexico making for the Mexico City Metropolitan area, which fills most of the valley. Today, this metropolitan area accounts for 45 per cent of the country's industrial activity, 38 percent of GNP, and 25 percent of the population. Much of its industry is concentrated in the northern part of the Federal District and the adjoining cities in the state of Mexico. While population growth has slowed and even declined in the city proper, the outer limits of the metropolitan area keep growing. Much of this growth has occurred on the mountainsides of the valley, in the form of illegal settlements in ecologically sensitive areas. Overall urban settlement in the valley has expanded from about in 1940 to in 1990. The metropolitan area has about 21 million residents and about 6 million cars.\n\nMexico City is vulnerable to severe air pollution problems due to its altitude, its being surrounded by mountains and the winds patterns of the area. The altitude, with its low oxygen levels, makes for poor combustion of fossil fuels leading to unsafe levels of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. The valley is surrounded by mountain ranges with one small opening to the north. The surrounding mountains and climate patterns here make it difficult to clear out the smog produced. The valley has internal wind patterns which circulate around the valley without a prevailing wind to push contaminants in a single direction. The most significant climatic phenomena here is \"thermal inversion,\" which is prevalent in the winter months when the cooler air of the valley is trapped by relatively warmer air above. Adding to this is that prevailing winds outside the valley move from north to south, in through the Valley's one opening, where incidentally most of the region's industry is located. These factors diminish in the summer and the situation is helped by the arrival of the rainy season, but the valley's southern latitude and the abundance of sunlight allows for dangerous levels of ozone and other dangerous compounds.\nWhile still considered one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are not as bad as they were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.\nIn the 1940s, before large-scale burning of fossil fuels in the area, the visibility of the valley was about , allowing for daily viewing of the mountain ranges that surround the valley, including the snow-capped volcanoes of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. Since that time, the average visibility has come down to about . Mountain peaks are now rarely visible from the city itself. While reduced visibility in the valley was due to sulfur emissions in the past, it is now due to fine particles in the air.\n\nThe effects on humans living in an enclosed, contaminated environment have been documented, especially by Nobel Prize winner Dr Mario J. Molina. He claims fine particle pollution is the greatest concern because of lung damage. According to him, the city's residents lose about 2.5 million working days every year due to health problems associated with fine particles.\n\nThe Valley of Mexico is a closed basin which geologically divides into three hydrologic zones, the low plain, which is essentially the bed of now-extinct lakes, the piedmont area and the surrounding mountains. The old lakebeds correspond to the lowest elevations of the valley in the south are mostly clay with a high water content and are almost entirely covered by urban development. In the piedmont area, these clays become mixed with silts and sands, and in some areas close to the mountains, the piedmont is largely composed of basalt from old lava flows. The valley is enclosed completely by mountain ranges, from which flow rain and melting snow into the valley's hydraulic system. This groundwater flow produces a number of springs in the foothills and upwellings in the valley floor. This underground flow is the source of the five aquifers that provide much of the drinking water to Mexico City located in Soltepec, Apan, Texcoco, Chalco-Amecameca and underneath Mexico City itself.\n\nBefore the 20th century, the Mexico City portion of the valley contained a series of lakes, with saline lakes to the north near the town of Texcoco and freshwater ones to the south. The five lakes, Zumpango, Xaltoca, Xochimilco, Chalco, and the largest, Texcoco used to cover about of the basin floor. Small mountains such as the Sierra de Guadalupe and Mount Chiconaultla partially separated the lakes from each other. All the other lakes flowed toward the lower Lake Texcoco, which was saline due to evaporation. The lakes were fed by a number of rivers such as the San Joaquin, San Antonio Abad, Tacubaya, Becerra, Mixcoac and Magdalena Contreras, carrying runoff and snowmelt from the mountains.\n\nLong before the arrival of the Spanish, the lake system had been shrinking due to climate change. Warmer temperatures had increased evaporation and reduced rainfall in the area so that the lakes’ waters were shallow at about five meters (16 ft) deep as early as the Tlapacoya culture, around 10,000 BCE. During the Aztec Empire, the northern lakes were inaccessible by canoe during the dry season from October to May.\n\nFor 2000 years, humans have been interfering with and altering the hydraulic conditions of the valley, especially in the lakes region. The Aztecs built dikes for flood control and to separate the saline water of the northern lakes from the fresh water of the southern ones. After the destruction of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the Spaniards rebuilt the Aztec dikes but found they did not offer enough flood protection.\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish and subsequent efforts to drain the area for flood control was a major infrastructure project, called the , was pursued the entire colonial period.\n\nThe idea of opening drainage canals first came about after a flood of the colonial city in 1555. The first canal was begun in 1605 to drain the waters of Lake Zumpango north through Huehuetoca which would also divert waters from the Cuautitlán River away from the lakes and toward the Tula River. This project was undertaken by Enrico Martínez and he devoted 25 years of his life to it. He did succeed in building a canal in this area, calling it Nochistongo, leading waters to the Tula Valley, but the drainage was not sufficient to avoid the Great Flood of 1629 in the city. Another canal, which would be dubbed the \"Grand Canal\" was built parallel to the Nochistongo one ending in Tequixquiac. The Grand Canal consists of one main canal, which measures in diameter and long. The drainage project was continued after independence, with three secondary canals, built between 1856 and 1867. During the presidency of Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876–1911) drainage again became a priority. Díaz completed it officially in 1894, although work continued thereafter. Despite the Grand Canal's drainage capacity, it did not solve the problem of flooding in the city.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century, Mexico City began to sink rapidly and pumps needed to be installed in the Grand Canal, which before had drained the valley purely with gravity. Along with the pumps, the Grand Canal was expanded with a new tunnel through the low mountains called the Xalpa to take the canal past Tequisquiac. Even so, the city still suffered floods in 1950 and 1951. Despite its age, the Grand Canal can still carry out of the valley, but this is significantly less than what it could carry as late as 1975 because continued sinking of the city (as much as ) weakens the system of water collectors and pumps.\n\nAs a result, another tunnel, called the Emisor Central, was built to carry wastewater. Although it is considered the most important pipe in the country, it has been damaged by overuse and corrosion of its diameter walls. Because of lack of maintenance and gradual decrease in this tunnel's ability to carry water, there is concern that this tunnel will soon fail. It is continuously filled with water, making it impossible to inspect it for problems. If it fails, it would most likely be during the rainy season when it carries the most water, which would cause extensive flooding in the historic center, the airport and the boroughs on the east side.\n\nBecause of this, another new drainage project is planned that will cost US$1.3 billion. The project includes new pumping stations, a new drainage tunnel and repairs to the current system of pipes and tunnels to clear blockages and patch leaks.\n\nOver-pumping of groundwater in the 20th century has hastened the disappearance of the lakes. The old lake beds are almost all paved except for some canals preserved in Xochimilco, mostly for the benefit of visitors who tour them on brightly painted , boats similar to gondolas.\n\nDesiccation has had a major environmental impact on the Valley of Mexico.\n\nHistorically, Mexico City's potable water supply came via aqueduct from the mountain springs on the valley sides like that in Chapultepec as most of the water in Lake Texcoco was saline. These were originally built by the Aztecs and were rebuilt by the Spaniards. In the mid-1850s, potable groundwater was found underneath the city itself, which motivated the large-scale drilling of wells. Today, 70% of Mexico City's water still comes from five principal aquifers in the valley. These aquifers are fed by water from natural springs and runoff from precipitation.\n\nIt was only when the population reached about six million that Mexico City started to need to appropriate water from outside the valley.\nToday, Mexico City faces a serious water deficit. Because of increased demand from a growing population, increasing industry, and ecosystem degradation in the form of deforestation of the surrounding mountains, more water is leaving the system than is entering. It is estimated that of water is needed to support the potable and agricultural irrigation needs of Mexico City's population. The main aquifer is being pumped at a rate of , but is only being replaced at , or about half of the extraction rate, leaving a shortfall of .\nThis over-extraction of groundwater from the old clay lake bed has been causing the land upon which the city rests to collapse and sink. This problem began in the early 20th century as a consequence of the drainage of the valley for flood control. Since the beginning of the 20th century, some areas of Mexico City have sunk nine meters (30 ft). In 1900, the bottom of the lake was three meters (10 ft) lower than the median level of the city center. By 1974, the lake bottom was two meters (7 ft) higher than the city. The first signs of dropping ground water levels was the drying up of natural springs in the 1930s, which coincides with the beginning of intensive exploitation of the aquifer system through wells between deep. Today, Mexico City is sinking between five and forty centimeters (0.2 and 1.3 ft) per year, and its effects are visible. El Ángel de la Independencia (\"The Angel of Independence\") statue, located on Paseo de la Reforma was built in 1910, anchored by a foundation deep beneath what was the surface of the street at that time. However, because the street has sunk around it, steps have been added to allow access to the statue's base.\n\nSubsidence of the valley floor beneath has caused flooding problems as now much of the city has sunk below the natural lake floor. Currently, pumps need to work 24 hours a day all year round to keep control of runoff and wastewater. Despite this, flooding is still common, especially in the summer rainy season, in lower-lying neighborhoods such as Iztapalapa, forcing residents to build miniature dikes in front of their houses to prevent heavily polluted rainwater from entering their homes. Subsidence also causes damage to water and sewer lines, leaving the water distribution system vulnerable to contamination which carries risks to public health.\nMeasures other than drainage have been implemented to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff. Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted before they reach the city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed to sink into the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open combined sewers. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.\n\n"}

P.M Abrams; and commissioned 5 October 1942, Comdr. Palmer M. Gunnell in command.\n\nAfter operations along the Atlantic coast, the oiler transited the Panama Canal and sailed 18 February 1943 for Fanui Bay, Bora Bora, mothering a brood of 11 subchasers, five yard minesweepers, numerous LCI(L)’s, and one net tender. Four motor torpedo boats nested in cradles in the forward and after well decks. \"Pecos\" fueled each small craft every four days. Throughout the voyage, groups of boats came alongside the tanker for fuel; then, replenished, gave place to others. \"Pecos\" next supported the landings at Tarawa, Gilbert Islands, refueling the bombardment and transport groups. She returned to the West Coast late in 1943 and departed San Pedro, Calif., on New Year’s Eve after undergoing repairs and loading with oil and supplies.\n\n\"Pecos\" departed Majuro Atoll 2 February 1944 to escort \"Washington\" into the anchorage after the latter’s bow had been shorn off in collision with \"Indiana\". For over three hours the officers and men of \"Pecos\" worked at the delicate task of getting the huge battleship alongside, then maneuvering her into the atoll. She performed the whole operation in the dark, and acted as anchor for \"Washington\" overnight. Less than two weeks after Kwajalein Atoll fell to the Americans, the tanker steamed into the lagoon and refueled warships in the Marshall Islands until returning to Pearl Harbor early in March for oil and supplies. She then headed for the southwest Pacific to support strikes against the Palaus in late March and early April.\n\nFor ten hours on 10 July, shells from marine “Long-Tom” cannons flew over \"Pecos\" as she lay at anchor off Saipan, refueling cruisers, destroyers, and an LST full of high explosives. The oiler next began fueling operations running between Eniwetok in the Marshalls and Manus in the Admiralty Islands. In September, she participated in the Palau invasion, fueling the bombardment and transport groups.\n\nOn 2 January 1945, Japanese aircraft attacked the tanker as she steamed from Leyte Gulf toward Mindoro. The following day seven general quarters alarms announced Japanese planes. A bomb exploded so close astern that the oil feed pump fuses blew temporarily stopping the main engine. On the evening of 4 January, three enemy planes attacked the anchorage in Mangarin Bay, Mindoro. One bomb, a dud, skipped from the water and smashed into the after port cargo boom of \"Pecos\", bending it almost double. A plane crashed into an ammunition ship lying less than a mile away, causing it to explode in a single, blinding flash. \"Pecos\"' guns splashed one attacker. \"Pecos\" shot down two more Japanese planes during a raid in the Sulu Sea off Negros Island.\n\nA single engine Japanese plane dove out of the sun on the ship’s starboard quarter 7 January 1945, releasing a bomb that struck the water 100 feet off her port bow before a tanker ahead of \"Pecos\" shot this plane down. During the next weeks, \"Pecos\" fueled the huge task force steaming up the South China Sea for the Lingayen landings. General Quarters became as routine an affair as fueling, as enemy planes continued to operate in the Mindoro area.\n\nThe veteran oiler next steamed to Mangarin Bay to supply aviation gasoline for an Army Air Force unit based there 18 February. Previously, fuel for the squadron’s P–38 fighters had been flown in by transport aircraft, but the planes now were virtually grounded for lack of gasoline. At the month’s end, \"Pecos\" departed the Philippine area for Ulithi Atoll in the Western Caroline Islands to prepare for the war’s final major landing operation at Okinawa, She spent April and May at sea in the fueling area off Okinawa transferring oil and gasoline to 3rd Fleet ships.\n\n\"Pecos\" spent two hectic days outside of Hagushi Anchorage, adjoining the war-torn city of Naha, fueling destroyers on the perilous picket lines. On the evening of 20 May, in a major Japanese air raid, kamikaze pilots hit five of the picket ships. but the tanker was untouched. \"Pecos\" sailed for the United States on 28 May, after seventeen consecutive months overseas. With overhaul completed, \"Pecos\" departed San Francisco 14 August 1945—as word was received of the end of hostilities. By 26 September she was anchored in Sasebo Ko, Kyushu Island, Japan, which had just been occupied by American naval forces, fueling the vessels in the harbor.\n\n\"Pecos\" decommissioned 14 March 1946. She was transferred to the Maritime Commission 1 April 1947 and struck from the Navy List 23 April 1947. By directive dated January 1948, \"Pecos\" was reacquired by the Navy. She was reinstated on the Navy List 20 March 1950. She was then taken over by the Military Sea Transportation Service 18 July 1950 to be operated by a merchant crew. USNS Pecos was operated by Mathiasen's Tanker Industry Inc under contract to the U.S. Government until 1975. Commodore Larry Wade was CO from March 13, 1972 until October 19, 1972 during which time she traded in the Caribbean and made trips to the Arctic assigned to the 1st Naval District. In October 1957, while on a voyage to the Middle East, she received an SOS from the USS \"Merrimack\" (AO-37) after the oiler had lost all propulsion power. The rendered assistance until \"Pecos\" arrived and towed the stricken ship into Bombay, India. In 1970 she was still serving MSTS. She decommissioned and sold for scrap at an unknown date.\n\n\"Pecos\" received seven Battle Stars for World War II service.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.navsource.org/archives/09/19/19065.htm"}

He then went on to Trinity & All Saints University College in Horsforth, Leeds, where he studied Media. He later met Ricky Wilson and Andrew \"Whitey\" White at a mod night called Move on Up at The Underground in Leeds. Together they formed Runston Parva, later to be called Parva and now Kaiser Chiefs.\n\nTogether with bandmate Ricky Wilson, Hodgson started the Leeds club night Pigs \"to give us something to look forward to\". After giving the rest of the band a mix CD with songs he had been playing at Pigs, they formed Kaiser Chiefs, scrapping all their old songs and changing \"the way we play, the way we dress, basically everything we could change without changing ... our faces\".\n\nHodgson is a founding member of Leeds indie rock band Kaiser Chiefs, and their drummer and main backing vocalist between 2003 and 2012. He takes lead vocals on tracks Boxing Champ and Man On Mars. On 4 December 2012, Hodgson announced via his Twitter account that he had left Kaiser Chiefs to concentrate on other projects.\n\nSince his departure from Kaiser Chiefs, Hodgson has refocused his attentions on the studio. In an interview with \"NME\", he spoke of his decision to split from the band, stating: \"It was obvious really, because they know I love the studio and I love writing and I'm not mad about touring. I loved touring at some point, but I didn't love it all the time and I didn't love it as much as everyone else.\"\n\nOn 26 March 2017, Hodgson teased via his Twitter account that he was making a solo record by tweeting \"If I tweet that I'm making solo material then I have to do it.

{"id": "2040090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040090", "title": "Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir", "text": "Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir\n\nDate palms are cultivated in Sudan from the Egyptian border in the North all the way along the Nile south of Khartoum until Sennar. In addition to the banks of the Nile, isolated occurrences of cultivated date trees occur in the Red Sea Hills in the vicinity of Port Sudan, in Kassala, along the Atbara River, in the deserts around Dongola and far Southwest in Darfur, for example in Wadi Kutum, Wadi Mellit and Barra. In all these locations, the palm trees depend on accessible ground water or on irrigation. The water for irrigation is either taken from wells or from the river Nile, where it is nowadays provided by diesel pumps.\nSudan is among the countries that produce good quality dates. Bilad al-Mahas, Sukut, Dongola, Dar al-Shaiqiyah, Dar al-Manasir, Dar al-Rubatab and the areas around Bauqah and Berber along the Nile boast extensive date groves. In each date growing region a particular composition of palm tree varieties, including endemic species, are grown. During the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (1899—1955), Dar al-Manasir had been described as the southernmost limit of date cultivation in the Sudan\n\nWhen approaching Dar al-Manasir from the surrounding deserts, the most striking feature of the landscape is the sudden green narrow band of palm trees lining the shores of the Nile. This strip of land is called \"Ashu\" (أشو), and is generally not more than 20 meters wide. It is situated between the seasonally inundated land of the river bank called Gerif (جرف) and the traditional \"waterwheel land\" called \"Saqiah\" (ساقية).\n\nDate palm trees and Doum palms (\"Hyphaene thebaica\") are perfectly adapted to the regional climate of Dar al-Manasir. They are drought resistant and can withstand the exceptionally hot dry and rainless summers and cold dry winters. The proximity of \"Ashu\" land to the river Nile makes the water table accessible to the deeply penetrating roots of fully grown palm trees throughout the year, making it the most valuable class of land. Since dates constitute the most relevant cash crop in Dar al-Manasir their cultivation is not limited to \"Ashu\" land only, but expands along the irrigation channels of the \"Saqiah\" land. During recent years date trees even substitute seasonally irrigated crops such as wheat, beans and okra on the traditional \"Saqiah\" land.\n\nIn order to multiply the number of fruit-bearing trees traditional offshoot propagation is practised all along the Nile in Sudan. Lower offshoots called \"Shatla\" (شتلا) develop from axillary buds at the lower trunk of a parent palm and are cut off during early spring season. A well chosen offshoot will not only guarantee a female fruit bearing palm tree but also inherit the same qualities of its mother plant. The date trees in the region of the Fourth Cataract attain an age of up to 150 years and consist most often of multiple shoots from a single clump called \"Bu'rah\" or \"Hufrah\" (بؤرة or حفرة). Satisfactory date production ceases with an age of 90 to 100 years. With increasing age and height the palm tree becomes more difficult to climb in order to be pollinated and harvested.\n\nPollination of the female fruits is conducted in late February and beginning of March which is, according to the Coptic calendar still used for agricultural purposes by the Manasir, the end of the month \"Amshir\". During this season the stout male spathes split and their inflorescences reach maturity. Fresh strands of flowers are carefully picked out of the male clusters and packaged to strands of two called \"Rabetah Qaru'ah\" (ربطة قرعة). The Manasir consider the variety of a potent male seedling irrelevant and pollinate all their female inflorescences from the same male tree. The process of pollination is called \"Qaffes\" (قفّز) and can be carried out by any person physically able to climb the palm tree. In each spathe of female inflorescence about 8-15 packages are tucked between the fruit bearing spikelets. An adult female palm produces around 15 to 25 spathes, each spathe containing 150 to 200 date bearing spikelets.\n\nDates have to pass five stages of growth before developing into ripe fruits (\"Tamr\", تمر) that are harvested in August and September:\n\nOnce a date tree is successfully planted it constitutes an economic plant returning good yearly yields for little labour. A mature date tree supplied with sufficient water and natural fertilizer (\"Sibalah\", زبالة) will produce in-between two and three sacks (\"Shawal\", شوال) each about 75 kilos (1 \"Shawal\" = 15 \"Ruba\"' = 123.75 litres. The exact amount depends strongly on the date variety, the specific growing conditions and age of the palm tree. A survey of the region in 1995 reported an average ownership of 26 date trees per household, producing approximately 900 kg annually .\n\nTraditionally the harvest is stored in old water jars (\"Sir\", زيرor \"Gerr\", جرّ) that are preparatorily lined with ash. A further layer of ash on top seals it and protects the fruits from maggots (\"Sus\", سوس), (cf. Material Culture of the Manasir).\n\nEach farming household in Dar al-Manasir owns or at least shares a number of date trees. They are a viable source of income and nutrition.\n\nDate and Doum palms are not only important because of their edible fruits. The by-products of these trees make up the essential raw material for locally produced tools and handicrafts (cf. Material Culture of the Manasir).\n\nIn addition, date seeds (\"Nawa\", نوى) and the \"Dafiq\"-fruits are used as fodder. They are recommended to improve the taste of both meat and milk of the livestock. The seeds are crushed on lower grinding stones (\"Tāhūnah\", طاحونة - originally used for grinding flour). Surplus is sold at the weekly local market \"Suq Salamat\" and is the most expensive kind of fodder.\n\nDate trees also constitute a constant source of pride and belonging. The special relationship between the Manasir and their palm trees is reflected in local traditions and sayings:\n\nWhenever a new date shoot is planted the process is accompanied by a traditional invocation; the Bismallah is followed by the sentence \"The intention (نية) is white and the soil (طين) is black. The fruits of this tree are freely offered (صدقة) to the beggar, freely offered to the thief\". That is to say that the tree should provide alms in the name of Allah to whoever is in need of it, and therefore should be under His protection.\n\nSalih recorded a similar saying in Birti: \"It has been planted for hungry people, passing by guests, wayfarers, thieves, good will seekers, enemies and friends\". The author is further bringing a custom to attention that permits everybody in Dar al-Manasir to collect date fruits for immediate consumption. This custom, usually applied only to dates fallen to the ground and for women and children, differs from the national Islamic and statuary law on that matter.\n\nThe mentioned economic, cultural and social factors result in a practical inconceivability of selling palm trees as real assets among the Manasir. The situation in the twenties of last century, as described by Leach (1919) with the following words is still very much true of today; \n\n\"… a man being in need of money, but disliking the thought of parting from the whole of his property, might sell half a tree. This however was a very rare occurrence, and was only resorted to occasionally in cases of real distress and only in […] the poorest part of the province. […] In ordinary circumstances it was a disgrace to sell either land or date trees\".\n\nTo quote the Mansuri 'Abdallah Ahmad al-Hassan Abu Qurun (عبدالله أحمد الحسن أبو قرون) in 2005: \n\n\"I have almost seen all of Dar al-Manasir and I know of whole gardens being sold in the [neighbouring] Shaiqiyah Country and Rubatab Country. But I know of no more than two instances when a Mansuri ever sold his palm trees. And in both cases they only sold one, two or three trees reacting in an emergency situation. Usually, in such situations of financial difficulties the people will ask the person to be patient until they collectively manage to come up with the necessary money. This is why you cannot put a price on a palm tree; you would not be able to sell it. Date trees do not have a price! Your palm trees and your offspring are regarded as one (التمر دي و جناك واحيد)\".\nThis attitude of the Manasir is reflected in the practice of local merchants issuing loans to peasants in exchange for prospected harvests of particular trees.\n\nFor most Manasir it is therefore inconceivable to receive monetary compensation in exchange for their palm trees which are going to be flooded together with their villages and other agricultural land as a result of the erection of the Hamdab High Dam (Marawi Multi-Purpose Hydro Project). According to al-Hakem (1993:6) about 675,000 productive date trees will be lost in the course of flooding the reservoir lake. The information brochure of the Manasir Committee speaks of 250,000 productive and 300,000 male or not yet fruit-bearing date trees in the year 2003 (تقدير النخيل المثمر فى عام 2003 م=250.000 نخلة تقريبا و تقدير النخيل الغير مثمر فى عام 2003 م=300.000 نخلة تقريبا).\n\nIn spring 2005 there still has not been any reliable information and therefore much confusion among the local population on the matter of which palm trees (depending on the status of land, age of trees and amount of taxes previously paid) are eventually going to be compensated and for how much. Apart from the monetary compensation, each 120 date trees on private property are supposedly to be compensated with one Feddan (4,200 m²) of land in the new relocation areas.\n\nSince the local peasants are still kept unclear about the actual level of the reservoir lake and its consequences for the Nile water regime and the banks of the artificial lake, many nourish hopes to be able to continue living and cultivating their homeland. As a consequence only months ahead of forced resettlement new shoots of date trees are transplanted to higher areas and irrigated with much effort.\n\nEven in the unlikely case of a reasonable monetary compensation, the loss of their date trees would pose a hardship especially for the older Manasir, who laboriously cultivated these trees to be able to live from their harvest in their old age when they can't work in the agriculture anymore.\n\nThe Manasir are renowned all throughout the Sudan for cultivating a wide range of date palm cultivars. Any small farming household tends to grow a variety of dates in order to be less vulnerable both to annually changing market prices and diseases affecting only specific types.\n\nThe people are very proud of the taste, sweetness and nourishing merits of their dates and believe that these originate from their rocky land containing special minerals. The dates from Dar al-Manasir compare well with dates of other regions in Sudan, although earlier reports qualify them as being of inferior quality not fetching the market price of fruits from (Old) Halfa and Dongola\n\nDate varieties and the average wholesale price during the harvest season 2004\n\n(Sudanese Dinar per sack \"Shawal\", شوال – at about 75 kg; 1 \"Shawal\" = 15 \"Rub\"' (ربع) = 123.75 litres):\n\n\"Mishriq\" dates are the most common and cherished variety in Dar al-Manasir. Two types are differentiated; \"Wad Laqai\" and the more common \"Wad Khatib\", formerly also called \"Umm Laqai\" and \"Umm Khatib\". Both types are non-Nubian and originate in the area. \"Mishriq\" trees require more watering than other palm trees.\n\nThe \"Wad Laqai\" type is mostly found in the upstream end of Dar al-Manasir and in the neighbouring Rubatab Country around Abu Hammed. According to Yusif (1995:274) its full name is \"al-Mashriq Walid Laqai\" (المشرق ولد لقاي) which would literally translate \"\"to the East of the son of Laqai\"\". The author further states that this variety has been introduced by the son of a person called Laqai, who imported it from \"Higaz\" in Saudi Arabia where the dates are called \"Sukari\" (السكري). \"Wad Laqai\" has been apparently introduced to Sudan in the vicinity of the Island of Muqrat.\n\n\"Wad Laqai\" is considered to be one of the finest date fruits in the Sudan with an unrivalled softness and fresh taste. Some older Manasir still prefer to drink their tea along with a handful of \"Wad Laqai\" dates as the traditional sugar substitute. The dates should be left to dry on the tree, because of difficulties to remove the ripe fruits without causing adjacent dates from the same bunch (\"Shakhlub\", شخلوب) to fall off prematurely. Another peculiarity of the \"Wad Laqai\" type is that its fruits should not be pollinated before reaching the green stage (\"Dafiq\", دفيق). They are also considered most sensitive and therefore difficult to harvest. If fresh dates are picked others on the bunch easily turn into \"Karmush\"\n\nThe fruits are soft in consistency and can be pressed to form a cake called \"'Agwah\" (عجوة). The sample fruits, taken from Al-Atamanin on Shiri Island (العطمانين في شري), are short (about 3 centimeters), compact (width about 1.5 centimeters) and reddish in color. According to Yusif (1995:274) \"Wad Laqai\" fruits can also become rather oblong reaching the span of an index finger.\n\nThe leaves of \"Wad Laqai\" palms are wide and sweeping. The shape of the tree is similar to the \"Qundeil\" variety.\n\n\"Wad Khatib\" is the type of \"Mishriq\" palm trees best adapted to the stony and often shallow soil of the Fourth Cataract region. Yusif (1995:274) recalls that \"Wad Khatib\" had been introduced from Saudi Arabia by a man from Higaz called Bashir bin Khatib (بشير بن خطيب), apparently a descendant of Imam al-Shafi'i (رجل من الشوفعة). \"Wad Khatib\" is the most common variety of date trees in Dar al-Manasir and the neighbouring Rubatab Country.\n\nThe quality of \"Wad Khatib\" dates is generally inferior to \"Wad Laqai\" dates. \"Wad Khatib\" trees are recommended to be pollinated ahead of the \"Wad Laqai\" type. Part of their harvest is traditionally used for local alcohol production.\n\nThe sample fruits, from Sulhah on Sherari Island (صلحة في شرري), are even shorter and appear less reddish in colour than those of \"Wad Laqai\". The perianth of their fruits is attached stronger to the spikelets of the fruit bunch.\n\nThe appearance of the \"Wad Khatib\" palm tree differs from the other \"Mishriq\" type mainly by having slightly broader leaves.\n\n\"Barakawi\" dates are nowadays considered by many Manasir to be the most profitable date cultivar.\n\n\"Barakawi\" trees are increasingly planted on the \"Saqiah\" land, traditionally reserved for seasonally irrigated crops. \"Barakawi\" are highly demanded on the national market and according to Yusif (1995:274) are even exported to Egypt where they are also referred to as \"Ibrimi\" (ابريمي) and \"Sakuti\" (سكوتي). \"Barakawi\" are not among the most common palm trees in Dar al-Manasir, but their number increases considerably towards the downstream end and in the neighbouring Shaiqiyah Country with a centre of cultivation in the area of Karima. YUSIF (1995:274) states further that \"Barakawi\" dates have been introduced from Mahas and the Shaiqiyah Country through Dar al-Manasir to the Rubatab Country in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe sample fruits, from Sulhah on Sherari Island (صلحة في شرري), are elongated, their proportions with about 5 centimeters length and 1.5 centimeters width being slightly longer than and not as thin as the average \"'Abid Rahim\" variety. Their deep reddish-brown colour changes from the centre of the fruits towards the perianth into a light yellow discolouration.\n\n\"Barakawi\" palms are among the taller varieties of palm trees in Dar al-Manasir.\n\nThe \"ʿAbid Rahim\" cultivar is favoured in Eastern Sudan. These dates are said to cause flatulence when consumed in large quantities.\n\nThe sample fruits, from Sulhah on Sherari Island (صلحة في شرري), are distinguishable from the otherwise similar \"Barakawi\" type by being longer (about 6 centimeters), thinner (1-1.5 centimeters) and lighter in weight. Their colour varies from a light yellow to a reddish brown.\n\nʿAbid Rahim trees are tall and potentially produce the highest quantity of harvest compared to other varieties in Dar al-Manasir. The shape of the palm is somewhat confined, with their leaves more upright.\n\nThe \"Bur\" cultivar exists only in the region of the Fourth Cataract. \"Bur\" palm trees, along with the \"Bireir\" and \"Qundeil\" varieties are only producing a limited quantity of harvest because a good share of their fruits is falling off the trees prematurely during the early stages of growth. Due to this unfavourable characteristic the number of cultivated Bur trees remains limited.\n\n\"Bur\" dates are easily distinguishable from other date types by their nearly black colour. The sample fruits, from Sulhah on Sherari Island (صلحة في شرري), appear well proportioned, about 4 cm long and fleshy. \"Bur\" dates can be eaten both fresh and dry, but should be consumed only in small amounts.\n\n\"Bur\" palms are among the taller palm trees in Dar al-Manasir.\n\n\"Bireir\" trees, alike the \"Mishriq\" and \"Bur\" varieties are of non-Nubian origin. Their fruits are praised for their quality, the flesh closing firmly upon the seed thereby staying soft and juicy for a long time. Their taste is attributed to be \"hot\" that is to say very sweet and tasty. Yusif (1995:277) quotes a local saying from the neighbouring Rubatab Country, by which a bird feeding too much on dates from the \"Bireir\" variety would suffer from a dry stomach, eventually causing it to drop dead from the sky. \"Bireir\" dates like \"Wad Laqai\" dates can be sold as a compressed cake called \"'Agwah\" (عجوة). \"Bireir\" dates are also traditionally used for the production of local wine (\"Khumur\", خمور).\n\nYusif (1995:279) differentiates four cultivars of the \"Bireir\" type in the neighbouring Rubatab Country;\n\n\n\"Bireir\" palms are among the taller palm trees in Dar al-Manasir.\n\nThe \"Qundeil\" variety has been introduced to Dar al-Manasir from the regions of Mahas and Sukut north of Dongola during the past decades. Like the \"Bur\" and \"Bireir\" varieties their produce in the region of the Fourth Cataract is limited by the fact that a good share of their fruits fall off prematurely.\n\nThe fruit is substantial, its taste not very sweet.\n\nThe \"Bit Tamudhah\" variety is rarely to be found in Dar al-Manasir and has been introduced from the area of Mahas north of Dongola.\n\n\"Tamarat Muhummed\" is alternatively called \"Diqis\" (دقس) and \"'Akish\" (عكيش) and among the uncommon varieties in Dar al-Manasir. Its trees are known to produce high quantities of fruits.\n\n\"Gau\" dates can originate from self-sown trees or date varieties that have reverted to kind either through uncongenial surroundings, improper cultures, insufficient water or other reasons. \"Gau\" dates are fed to the livestock and sold on the market for a low price.\n\nThe sample fruits are very small (about 1.5 centimeters long and 1 centimeter wide) and light. Their colour varies from light yellow to yellowish red. Gau trees often consist of a clump of shoots from the same root which is called \"Bu'rah\" (بؤرة) or \"Hufrah\" (حفرة).\n\nAny tasteless date variety that has become dry while still being attached to the fruit bunch is called \"Karmush\". Similar to \"Gau\" fruits \"Karmush\" dates are used as fodder.\n\nThe date fruit is nutritious, sweet and can easily be stored all year long. The Manasir believe that human beings can survive for years if they just have enough dates and water. The Bedouin Manasir alternatively call dates \"al-Zad al-negidh\" (الزاد النجيض) with the meaning of \"the 'real' food for travelling\".\n\nDry dates are washed, moistened in water and offered in-between and following the two daily meals. Date fruits constitute the traditional substitute for sugar and are consumed with tea.\n\nThe Manasir kitchen also uses dates for the following dishes:\n\nDuring festivals alcoholic beverages made from dates have been consumed traditionally:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040106", "title": "Demand Note", "text": "Demand Note\n\nA Demand Note is a type of United States paper money that was issued between August 1861 and April 1862 during the American Civil War in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 US$. Demand Notes were the first issue of paper money by the United States that achieved wide circulation and they are still in circulation today, though they are now extremely rare. The U.S. government placed the Demand Notes into circulation by using them to pay expenses incurred during the Civil War including the salaries of its workers and military personnel.\n\nBecause of the distinctive green ink on their reverse, and because state-chartered bank and Confederate notes of the day typically had blank reverse, the Demand Notes were nicknamed \"greenbacks\", a name later inherited by United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes. The obverse of the Demand Notes contained familiar elements such as the images of a bald eagle, Abraham Lincoln, and Alexander Hamilton, though the portraits used on Demand Notes are different from the ones seen on U.S. currency today.\n\nWhen Demand Notes were discontinued, their successors, the Legal Tender Notes, could not be used to pay import duties, a large part of the U.S. federal tax base at the time, and thus Demand Notes took precedence. As a result, most Demand Notes were redeemed, though the few remaining Demand Notes are the oldest valid currency in the United States today.\n\nBetween the adoption of the United States Constitution and the civil war, the United States government did not issue paper money as it is known today, but on many occasions it did issue short term debt called Treasury Notes, but they were not considered legal tender. The Demand Notes were a transitional issue connecting these Treasury Notes to modern paper money. The Demand Notes had been intended to function as money but were authorized within the legal framework of Treasury Notes since the U.S. was not generally assumed to have the authority to issue banknotes at that time.\n\nThe Continental Congress had issued Continental dollars between 1775 and 1779 to help finance the American Revolution. The paper Continental dollars nominally entitled the bearer to an equivalent amount of Spanish milled dollars but were never redeemed in silver and lost 99% of their value by 1790 despite the American victory. With the fate of the Continentals in mind, the Founding Fathers embedded in the constitution no provision for a paper currency, and the constitution explicitly prohibits states from making anything but gold or silver legal tender. As a result, the pre-civil war circulation of banknotes in the United States consisted of private issues, including issues by private federally chartered banks such as the First and the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nWhile the constitution did not explicitly grant the power to issue paper currency, it did grant the power to borrow money. Treasury Notes, as a form of debt, were an innovation to help bridge federal financing gaps when the government encountered difficulty selling a sufficient amount of long term bonds, or loan \"stock\". Treasury Notes were first employed during the War of 1812 and were issued irregularly up through the civil war. Characteristically the issues were not extensive and the \"polite fiction\" was always maintained that Treasury Notes did not serve as money when, in fact, to a limited extent they did. These notes usually bore interest, their value varied with market conditions, and they rapidly disappeared from the financial system after the crisis associated with their issuance had ended.\n\nAmong the several issues of Treasury Notes, of special note are the \"Small Treasury Notes\" of 1815 which, like the Demand Notes, did not bear interest and were intended to circulate as currency – and thus are also candidates for \"the first U.S. paper money\". However, only $3,392,994 were issued, and these were rapidly exchanged for bonds. In witness to the limited circulation achieved by these notes, only two issued uncancelled examples of the Small Treasury Notes are known today vs. almost 1000 examples of the Demand Notes.\n\nFederal finances had not yet recovered from the Panic of 1857 when the election of President Lincoln, in 1860, made it even more difficult for the federal government to raise money in the bond market due to the increased threat of Southern secession and a possible war. At the outbreak of the civil war the Union was depending upon hand-to-mouth borrowing to meet expenses and with the beginning of hostilities at Fort Sumter in April 1861 the burden of funding the war effort and paying employees, including soldiers in the field, offered no small challenge.\n\nOne response from Congress was the Act of July 17, 1861, which allowed for $250,000,000 to be borrowed on the credit of the United States. Of this sum, up to $50,000,000 was authorized as non-interest bearing Treasury Notes, payable upon demand, in denominations less than fifty dollars and not less than ten dollars. These were called Demand Notes to distinguish them from the interest-bearing Treasury Notes in existence at the time.\n\nThe promise to pay specie \"on demand\" was a new obligation for Treasury Notes (though common on private banknotes) but would spare the cash-strapped treasury the intermediate step of selling an equivalent amount of debt by allowing it to use the notes as a currency to pay creditors directly. The notes were to be redeemable through the assistant treasurers' offices at Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. They were to be hand signed by the first or second comptroller of currency or the Register of the Treasury; they were also supposed to be counter-signed by any other treasury officials designated by the secretary of the treasury. These signature provisions would later be altered several times. This act also stipulated that prior to December 31, 1862, an individual Demand Note could be re-issued into circulation after it was presented for redemption.\n\nJust before they were to be released, the Act of August 5, 1861, stipulated several changes to the issuance of Demand Notes. It allowed for Demand Notes to be issued in denominations of not less than $5 and be redeemable through the assistant treasurer's office at St. Louis or the bullion depository in Cincinnati. This act also stated that the Treasurer of the United States and Register of the Treasury or any treasury official appointed by the secretary of the treasury should sign the notes. Under this act, Demand Notes did not need to carry the seal of the U.S. Treasury. This act also granted a traditional privilege of Treasury Notes to the Demand Notes in that they were to be receivable in payment of all public dues, a privilege which was to figure prominently in their eventual disposition.\n\nBecause the Bureau of Engraving and Printing did not exist at the time, the American Bank Note Company and National Bank Note Company were contracted to create Demand Notes. Both companies were prominent printers of banknotes for private and state-chartered banks throughout the country. Most likely, the American Bank Note Company engraved the printing plates for $5 and $10 notes while the National Bank Note Company engraved the printing plates for the $20 notes. All of the Demand Notes were printed by the American Bank Note Company. As designed, they were of the same size, and in appearance closely resembled banknotes.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Chase began distributing the notes to meet Union obligations in August 1861. Initially, various merchants, banks and especially the railroad industry accepted the notes at a discounted rate or did not accept them at all. In order to ease public distrust in the newly issued notes Secretary Chase signed a paper agreeing to accept the notes in payment of his own salary and on September 3, 1861 Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott issued a circular to his soldiers arguing the convenience of the notes for those wishing to send home a portion of their pay. In mid-September Secretary Chase issued the following circular to the assistant treasurers to remove all doubt about the monetary status of the new notes:\nUnder the acts of July 19th and August 5th last, Treasury Notes of the denomination of $5, $10, and $20, have been, and will continue to be issued, redeemable in coin on demand at the offices of the assistant treasurer at Boston, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and at the Depository of Cincinnati. These notes are intended to furnish a current medium of payment, exchange, and remittance, being at all times convertible into coin at the option of holder, at the place where made payable, and everywhere receivable for public dues. They must be always equivalent to gold, and often and for many purposes more convenient and valuable.\nA sufficient amount of coin to redeem these notes promptly on demand will be kept with the depositaries, by whom they are respectively made payable. And all depositors and collecting officers will receive them, enter them on their books, and pay them to public creditors as money. Large amounts of the notes of small denominations are rapidly being issued and distributed. These actions also created a willingness on the part of banks to redeem the notes for coin as well. This put Demand Notes on par with the value and purchasing power of gold coins and they circulated widely among the public for private transactions. They could be redeemed for silver coinage as well.\n\nThe law allowed for the notes to be hand-signed by F.E. Spinner (Treasurer), and L.E. Chittenden (Register of the Treasury). This proved unfeasible, however, and Congress also authorized the notes to be signed by procurators. Seventy women were hired at an annual salary of $1,200 to sign the notes. A distinction of \"for the\" was written after a signature to indicate that it was being used in place of treasury officials. Apparently, some skilled women could even imitate the signature of F.E. Spinner. In late August \"for the\" was added to printing plates to simplify the hand-signing operation. The American Bank Note Company stopped printing notes payable at St. Louis and Cincinnati several days after revising printing plates with \"for the\".\n\nThe ability of the government to redeem the Demand Notes in specie came under pressure in December 1861. On December 10 Secretary Chase indicated that war expenditures were far exceeding projections while Federal revenues were falling short. Then on the 16th, news of the British reaction to the Trent Affair reached New York and the major banks, which had been supplying gold to the government in exchange for seven-thirties Treasury Notes and bonds which they had been in turn reselling, saw the demand for their offerings of Union securities drop precipitously. By the end of the month the banks had suspended specie payment on their own banknotes. The Demand Notes then began to appear at assistant treasurers' offices in great numbers for redemption, but since the government could not obtain adequate supplies of coin it was forced to follow suit and suspend redeeming the Demand Notes for gold in the first few days of 1862.\n\nThe inability of the Union government to redeem these notes for specie \"on demand\" caused great concern to Congress in early 1862. Some banks had pledged to make a $150 million loan to the government; the final installment was due on 4 February 1862, and these banks continued to accept Demand Notes for eventual use towards fulfilling this obligation. This supported the value of the notes during January.\nAfter 4 February, Secretary Chase authorized John Cisco, Assistant U.S. Treasurer in New York City, to accept Demand Notes for short term deposits at five percent interest – thus making the Demand Notes as good as interest bearing deposits, but with the credit of the government. New York banks quickly made the certificates of such deposits their clearing standard. The Demand Notes became the unit of account for dollar denominated obligations in place of gold, which had begun to disappear from circulation, having risen to a 1 to 2% premium over paper.\n\nDebate in Congress had turned towards meeting the demand obligation by declaring the notes legal tender – thus obligating all parties to accept them as payment-in-full for contracted debt. While this debate was on-going the cash needs of the government called and the Act of February 12, 1862, authorized an additional $10,000,000 in Demand Notes. This act brought the final possible amount of Demand Notes that could be issued to a sum of $60,000,000 (by April the full $60,000,000 in Demand Notes had been issued).\n\nEventually Congress decided to authorize $150,000,000 of Legal Tender Notes, also known as United States Notes, with the act of February 25, 1862. These were to be a new issue of U.S. currency, part of which were to replace the existing Demand Notes as those were redeemed. The new law, also known as the First Legal Tender Act, granted legal tender status to the new United States Notes except for the purposes of paying duties on imports and interest on U.S. debt. The government promised to continue paying the interest on its debt in coin, and it would accept only coin or Demand Notes in payment of customs duties. The obverse of 1862– and 1863-issue $5, $10, and $20 Legal Tender Notes were very similar in design to the respective Demand Notes, the major changes being the addition of the U.S. Treasury seal and removal of the words \"on demand\" from the promise to pay.\n\nSome confusion existed over the status of the Demand Notes until the act of March 17, 1862, clarified that these were to enjoy legal tender status as well. Thus, Demand Notes were at least as good as Legal Tender Notes, and clearly superior because only the former could be used to pay duties on imports – a major source of revenue to the Union government. As a result, Assistant Treasurer Cisco announced that he reserved the right to redeem future 5% short term deposits of Demand Notes in the new Legal Tender Notes and speculators, foreseeing the higher value of Demand Notes, removed them from circulation as the new notes began to circulate during April.\n\nOnce in circulation the Legal Tender Notes became the unit of account for prices in dollars – both gold and the hoarded Demand Notes were quoted in terms of them. In May the war began to turn against the Union and hopes for a quick end to hostilities were abandoned. As the year progressed the price of gold rose as the hoarding of commodities began in earnest. Eventually silver and even copper coins disappeared from circulation. As early as the second week of May the Demand Notes were being quoted at a premium for sale to importers who used them in place of gold to pay customs duties. The premium commanded by gold and Demand Notes became a political issue, and in June, Secretary Chase drew criticism by selling $2.25 million worth of 7.3% interest bearing Treasury Notes, seven-thirties, for Demand Notes at a three percent premium to par, which were immediately resold by the buyers for a six percent premium in legal tender. While this action allowed Secretary Chase to achieve two important goals, distributing the seven-thirties debt and retiring Demand Notes, it amounted to an official acknowledgement that the new United States Notes had depreciated compared to the Demand Notes. By mid-summer gold dollars were trading for a fifteen percent premium to legal tender while Demand Notes were available for an eight percent premium, and newspapers were reporting the price of Demand Notes under the description \"United States Notes for Custom-House Purposes\" or \"Custom-House Notes\". As customs duties averaged $6 to 9 million per month the slow drain of outstanding Demand Notes was tracked in the financial columns. By December it was estimated that the supply would soon be exhausted and that importers would have no option but gold for paying import duties. When the supply of Demand Notes had been nearly exhausted they commanded a price at parity with or at only a slight discount to gold dollars despite the fact that the latter continued to command a steep premium to United State Notes through the 1870s.\n\nBy June 30, 1863, only $3,300,000 of Demand Notes were outstanding versus almost $400,000,000 of Legal Tender Notes. By June 30, 1883 just $58,985 remained on the books of the treasury.\n\nThe obverses of all denominations Demand Notes contained the following common features printed on them:\n\n\nThe reverses of all Demand Notes contained , a large numeral of the denomination, and an indication of the denomination (as a small numeral or Roman numeral) repeated many times in a small geometric shape; all of the reverses were printed in green ink.\n\n\nFive dollar Demand Notes feature a small portrait of Alexander Hamilton at the lower right of the note. On the left is the \"Statue of Freedom\" that sits atop the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington D.C. However, at the time of issue, the \"Statue of Freedom\" was a work in progress and was not completed until 1862 and was not placed atop the Capitol dome until 1863. The base of the statue reads , but only \"\" is visible on the note.\n\nThe border of the note features the word printed numerous times horizontally at the top, bottom, and right of the note and vertically on the left of the note. The issuing bank note company was printed in middle of the top border and the phrase was printed in the middle of the bottom border.\nThere are several common features that are formatted uniquely on $5 Demand Notes. The date, left of Hamilton's portrait, is formatted specifically as \"\"ug. 10th 1861\"\". Also, \"\" appears after \"\" so that the full statement reads, \" United States \". Unlike $10 and $20 notes, five dollar Demand Notes have the phrase \"\"Payable by the Assistant Treasurer \" [location]\" printed, unbound and in full, in a cursive font. Also unlike the $10 and $20 Demand Notes, $5 notes redeemable at Philadelphia have the location written out in full.\n\nThe reverse of the $5 note contains a small numeral 5 inside of a small oval that is repeated numerous times; this design element surrounded the main design elements of the reverse of the note.\n\nTen dollar Demand Notes feature a portrait of Abraham Lincoln at left and an allegorical figure representing art to the right. In the top center of the note is a vignette of a bald eagle perched on olive branches with a ribbon stating . Next to the bald eagle is a heraldic stars and stripes shield. Both the portrait of Lincoln and bald eagle vignette were stock elements used on previous banknotes issued by the American Bank Note Company.\n\nThe border of the note contains the Roman numeral Ⅹ around almost the entire note. Like the $5 Demand Notes, the issuing bank note company was printed in middle of the top border and the phrase was printed in the middle of the bottom border. The top corners of the note contained two small numeral 10s surrounded by an ornate design. The vertical border design, along with the numeral 10s in the corners were stock elements used on other notes made by the American Bank Note Company. In fact, this stock element along with the portrait of Lincoln were also used on a later $10 bill from the Rutland County Bank of Vermont.\nThe $10 Demand Note too, has uniquely formatted common features. The date at the top right of the note is formatted as \"\"August 10, 1861.\"\" in a cursive font. Unlike the $5 Demand Notes, \"\" appears before \"\" so that the statement reads, \" Promises to Pay to the Bearer \"; the middle portion of the statement was printed in a cursive font. The phrase stating the location of payment on most notes was abbreviated to [location], the exception being Cincinnati where the replaced .\n\nThe reverse of the $10 note contains many small Roman Numeral Ⅹ's, each inside of a small square; the main elements of the reverse of the note were superimposed over this.\n\nTwenty Dollar Demand Notes, unlike the $5 and $10 notes, do not feature a portrait of a person. Instead, they feature a feminine allegory attributed either as representing Liberty, or perhaps America, in the center of the note. The figure has a sword in her right hand and holds a striped shield that features a bald eagle at the top of the shield in her left. A large green numeral 2 and 0 are located respectively to her right and left.\n\nThe border of the note features the word repeated numerous times horizontally on the top and bottom borders and vertically on the left and right borders. Also unlike the $5 and $10 notes, is located in the middle of the top border. The very middle of the bottom border contains the issuing bank note company, while \"\" is to the left and \"\" is to the right of this.\n\nThe date on the note is formatted as \"\"august 10th 1861\"\" in a cursive font. The statement of payment is formatted the same and surrounded by the same engraved object as the $10 Demand Note and is located in the center of the note under the figure of Liberty. The demand statement is printed as \" Promise To Pay Twenty Dollars To the Bearer\".\n\nThe reverse of the $20 Demand Note contains a small numeral 20 inside of an oval that is surrounded by an eight-sided star; all of this is located around the shield-shaped object with the numeral 20 in it. The top and bottom borders feature geometrical design elements with printed horizontally in every other geometric shape.\n\nDemand Notes are no longer found in circulation, but are instead in the hands of collectors. Of the surviving Demand Notes, the vast majority are $5 and $10 notes with \"For the\" engraved on them and from the locations of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. No notes are known with the actual signatures of F. E. Spinner and L. E. Chittenden. Because of their rarity, Demand Notes are mainly collected by acquiring a single example of the $5 and $10 denomination. Facsimile reproductions are also available.\n\nThe price and value of a Demand Note depends primarily on its rarity (which location and whether \"for the\" is handwritten or engraved) and secondarily on its condition. The more common five dollar notes usually range in price from $2,000 to $25,000. Ten dollar notes of the more common varieties usually have a value range of $4,000 to $30,000. Price ranges of the twenty dollar notes with \"for the\" engraved and from New York, Boston, and Philadelphia usually vary from $40,000 up to $100,000. Notes of any denomination with \"for the\" handwritten change hands at prices between $30,000 and $60,000. Notes from Cincinnati and St. Louis only very rarely change hands. Apart from the more common types, Demand Notes are usually only available for sale at auction.\n\nNotes:\n†: 3,000 $10 notes were reissues of redeemed notes thus creating the $30,000 overage of the legislated $60,000,000\n\n"}
{"id": "2040129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040129", "title": "Billet reading", "text": "Billet reading\n\nBillet reading, or the envelope trick, is a mentalist effect in which a performer pretends to use clairvoyance to read messages on folded papers or inside sealed envelopes. It is a widely performed \"standard\" of the mentalist craft since the middle of the 19th century. \"Billet\" is the French term for note or letter, referring to the rectangular shape of the paper.\n\nThe mentalist provides paper, pencils and envelopes to the audience, who are asked to write statements on the paper and then seal them in the envelopes. The envelopes are then collected and handed to the mentalist. The mentalist takes the first envelope and magically examines it, typically by holding it to their forehead. After concentrating, they announce what is written on the paper. The envelope is then opened to check that they have read it correctly. The mentalist then selects the next envelope and proceeds to mind-read the contents of the rest, one by one.\n\nBillet reading has been a popular trick for mentalists and mediums and spiritualists. It was one of the main acts that brought fame to Charles H. Foster, an American medium who popularized a version using folded slips some time in the 1850s or 60s. In the 1870s he was joined for a time by Bert Reese, who further popularized it. Magician Theodore Annemann talks about several of Reese's variations on the theme in articles in his mentalist's journal \"The Jinx\" which were republished after Annemann's death in the book \"Practical Mental Magic\". Reese's work became well known, and was the subject of several explanatory full-page articles in \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn his book \"The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism\", Hereward Carrington revealed the tricks of billet reading (with diagrams) that fraudulent mediums would use. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall observed Reese in New York and claimed to have discovered his cheating methods; according to Dingwall the exploits of Reese were \"not worth any serious scientific consideration\" and that Reese came into contact with the sealed notes. Martin Gardner wrote that Reese was an expert mentalist no different from stage magicians of the period such as Joseph Dunninger but managed to fool a number of people into believing he was a genuine psychic. Another magician to expose the methods of billet readers was Joseph Rinn.\n\nMany magicians take delight fooling billet readers in any number of ways. When used as a spiritualist act, the simplest method is to write questions to people who are not yet dead or are just made up, and then watch as the spiritualist pretends to contact the fake name. Another method is to write a statement that is so ribald, funny or startling that it trips up the performer when they read it. Exposing billet readers has a long history.\n\nMost billet reading is an example of a generalized class of tricks known as \"one ahead\" reading. It is accomplished by having the performer know one of the statements beforehand, typically through a plant, or through sleight of hand by opening one of them before starting the act.\n\nTo start the act, the mentalist selects the topmost envelope on the stack and pretends to mind-read the contents, typically by holding it to their forehead. Instead of announcing anything related to that envelope, they instead read aloud the memorized statement. The plant in the audience then cries out some variation of \"that's mine!\" Another variation is to claim to be unable to read the first card due to some problem, perhaps that the audience member's mind is closed or too powerful. In either event, the mentalist then opens the envelope to \"make sure they got it right\" or perhaps to \"see what is so confusing\" and is then able to read what a real audience member wrote on \"their\" billet.\n\nThe trick proceeds to the next envelope. The mentalist pretends to mind read it, but reads aloud the statement from the envelope \"previously\" opened. This time a real audience member is impressed and agrees they got it right. The mentalist then reads the contents of the second envelope and repeats this sequence. The trick then continues until the envelopes are exhausted, the last one being empty or the envelope of the plant. Throughout, the mentalist is \"one ahead\" in the envelope stack, pretending to be reading one while actually reading the next one.\n\nTo disguise the reason for opening the envelope, the typical variation used by mentalists has the audience members write questions on their cards, which the magician will answer. The magician then starts by making a statement like \"I feel beautiful!\", expresses some confusion about why he would say that, and then opens the envelope to read the question, \"will the weather be nice tomorrow?\" (while actually reading the next card, \"what is my shoe size?\"). As the questions may be impossible to guess, like a random person's shoe size, comedy or misdirection is often worked into the routine. For instance, \"a size larger than last year\" makes a reasonable answer to shoe size no matter who asks the question. Mediums may use the question and answer format as well, except that the questions are to be asked of the deceased, or perhaps are simply names of people to be contacted in the spirit world.\n\nThere are numerous variations on the theme of reading sealed notes which use sleight of hand to achieve the basic effect. Many of these involve quick palming of the billet, substitutions with pre-made billets, and other similar tricks. Annemann describes several such methods in depth, and many hundreds can be found in other works or on the internet.\n\nJohnny Carson's \"Carnac the Magnificent\" sketches parodied the billet reading trick by having Carnac announce the (seemingly normal) answer to an unseen question, then open the envelope and read the question, which revealed the answer to be a pun. No attempt at magic is even suggested; Carson simply used the trappings of the well-known trick as stagecraft for his jokes. The bit was borrowed from similar routines performed by Steve Allen (\"The Answer Man\") and Ernie Kovacs (\"Mr. Question Man\").\n\n"}

Robert Gregg, who was of Scottish ancestry, was station-master at the Bushford railway station in Rockcorry. He and his wife raised their children as strict Presbyterians, and sent their children to the village school in Rockcorry, which John Robert Gregg joined in 1872. On his second day of class, John Robert was caught whispering to a schoolmate, which prompted the schoolmaster to hit the two children's heads together. This incident profoundly damaged Gregg's hearing for the rest of his life, rendering him unable to participate fully in school, unable to understand his teacher. This ultimately led to John Robert unnecessarily being perceived as dull or mentally challenged by his peers, teachers, and family.\n\nIn 1877, one of Robert Gregg's friends, a journalist named Annesley, visited the village for a weekend. He was versed in Pitman Shorthand, and took verbatim notes of the sermon at the village church, causing the preacher to sweat and stutter, out of fear that his sermon, which he had plagiarized from a famous preacher, would be made public through Annesley's notes. That day, Robert Gregg saw the shorthand skill as a powerful asset, so he made it mandatory for his children to learn Pitman shorthand, with the exception of John, who was considered by his family too \"simple\" to learn it. None of the children succeeded in fully learning the system. On his own, John Robert learned a different shorthand system, that of Samuel Taylor, published in a small book by Odell. He taught himself the system fully, since he did not require the ability to hear in order to learn from the book.\n\nDue to hardships on the family, Gregg had to leave school before the age of 13 in order to support his family's income. He worked in a law office, earning five shillings a week.\n\nGregg said he initially set out to improve the English adaptation by John Matthew Sloan of the French Prévost Duployé Shorthand, while working with one of Sloan's sales agents, Thomas Malone. Malone published a system called \"Script Phonography\", of which Gregg asserted a share in authorship was owed to him. Angered by Malone, Gregg resigned from working with him and, encouraged by his older brother Samuel, published and copyrighted his own system of shorthand in 1888. It was put forth in a brochure entitled \"Light-Line Phonography: The Phonetic Handwriting\" which he published in Liverpool, England.\n\nIn 1893, he emigrated to the United States. That year he published \"Gregg Shorthand\". with great success. Gregg settled in Chicago where he wrote many books for the Gregg Publishing Company on shorthand and business practices.\n\n"}

In 1976, Hansson founded the Sweet Silence Studios and brought Rasmussen with him. In 1980, Rasmussen became co-owner of the studio, and one year later became an engineer, recording the 1981 album \"Difficult to Cure\" by Rainbow.

{"id": "2040166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040166", "title": "The Posies", "text": "The Posies\n\nThe Posies are an American power pop group. The band was formed in 1987 in Bellingham, Washington, United States, by primary songwriters Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow. They are best known for their radio hits \"Golden Blunders\" (from \"Dear 23\"), as well as \"Dream All Day\", \"Solar Sister\" and \"Flavor of the Month\" (from \"Frosting on the Beater\").\n\nTheir powerful melodic music has its origins in Merseybeat and the Hollies. They are influenced by Hüsker Dü, XTC, Elvis Costello and Squeeze.\n\nCore members Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow began writing songs together in late 1986 while Ken was in school at the University of Washington. Auer later recalled in an interview that \"we first met at a Dan Reed Network show; we were united in feeling we could do that stuff much better ourselves, the two of us\". Their first public performance came as an acoustic duo that next summer while Ken was home in Bellingham. During the last part of 1987 and the first two months of 1988, Ken drove home on weekends to join Jon as they recorded twelve songs in Jon's family's home studio. Though intended as demos to attract other members and form a full band, the recordings turned out so well that they became the Posies' first self-released album, \"Failure\". Interest in the Posies rose out of the numerous home-copied cassettes that began to spread around Seattle and Bellingham.\n\nMike Musburger and Arthur \"Rick\" Roberts joined soon after, allowing the band to play its first live shows in Seattle and Bellingham. The four members moved into a house in the University District of Seattle, where they developed many of the songs that would appear on later albums. \"Failure\" was released on vinyl near the end of 1988 on local indie label PopLlama with one song dropped.\n\nSeveral major labels noticed the band early on and in late 1989 they signed to new Geffen Records imprint DGC Records. They chose John Leckie to produce their first album for the label and \"Dear 23\" was released in August 1990. \"Golden Blunders\" reached No. 17 on the US Modern Rock charts. Ringo Starr covered the song for his 1992 album \"Time Takes Time\".\n\nUpon returning from an extensive U.S. tour, the Posies thought they were ready to record their third album. They headed to Robert Lang Studio in Shoreline, Washington, in late 1991 and recorded many of the songs they had been working on over the past two years. Among the recordings were three songs written (and two of them sung) by bassist Arthur Roberts. Jon and Ken later decided that Roberts' songs did not fit with the band and asked him to leave. The entire recording session was later scrapped and is referred to by fans as \"the Lost Sessions\". Roberts went on to front the bands Peach (on Caroline Records) and Sushirobo (on Pattern 25 Records).\n\nThe remaining members spent the next few months developing new songs, then in early 1992 began recording their third album with Don Fleming. After completing what they thought was their new album with the title \"Eclipse\", Geffen sent them back to the studio in the latter part of the year to record a few \"hits\". Dave Fox joined to play bass for the last of the \"Hit Sessions\" and the name then changed to \"Frosting On The Beater\" and was released in April 1993. Leadoff track \"Dream All Day\" enjoyed some success on U.S. MTV and alternative radio, becoming their biggest hit (#4 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart), leading the band to an extensive tour of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Due in part to rumors of a break-up Dave left the band in 1994 to join the Seattle band Flop.\n\nDuring a later European tour, a fight between Ken and Mike prompted Mike to leave the band. Mike then joined long-running Seattle punk band The Fastbacks, and was later a member of both Love Battery and Supersuckers.\n\nIn late 1994, Brian Young took over on drums and Joe Howard (AKA Joe Skyward, Joe Bass) played bass. Joe had earlier filled in on bass for a few shows after Roberts left in 1992. It wasn't long before the band again entered the studio to begin work on a fourth album. Originally using the working title \"What Color Is A Red Light?\", the bulk of \"Amazing Disgrace\" was finished in the first few months of 1995. Once again, the label wanted more hit material so they sent the band back to the studio near the end of the year where they recorded \"Ontario\". \"Amazing Disgrace\" was eventually released in May 1996.\n\nFaced with a changing radio climate and fans who longed for the smoother sounds of \"Frosting On The Beater\", the Posies found less success with \"Amazing Disgrace\" in the U.S. than with their previous album. The album fared better in Europe though, and led to it selling better worldwide than any of their previous efforts.\n\nAfter spending most of 1996 and the early part of 1997 on tour in the U.S. and Europe, and making an appearance in association with their former record company Popllama to perform \"Voyage of The Aquanauts\" in the Ocean Exploration episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy, the band returned home and shifted focus to other projects outside the Posies. Ken played a new batch of solo songs around the U.S. and released his self-recorded first solo album, \"This Sounds Like Goodbye\". Jon joined Seattle band Lucky Me as lead guitarist, Brian began drumming with Fountains of Wayne, while Joe began work on an album under the name Skyward. All of this solo work caused many to wonder if the Posies were finished as a band.\n\nThe Posies also performed with Burt Bacharach on a recording of his song \"What the World Needs Now Is Love,\" which was featured in the 1997 movie, \"\".\n\nIn late 1997, they came back together to play a small number of live shows, many accompanied by rumors of being the \"final show\". Instead, the band returned to the studio with the intent of writing their last chapter by rerecording a dozen unused older songs. \"Success\" was released in February 1998, again on the local PopLlama label. A tour followed, including a return to Europe. It was on this tour that the live album \"Alive Before the Iceberg\" was recorded. Upon returning, they played their real \"final\" shows in September, one in Seattle at the yearly Bumbershoot Festival and another in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1999 the Posies played a low-profile benefit show in honor of their longtime roadie and friend Joe Norcio. Jon and Ken spent the rest of the year focusing on their solo work. Ken formed a band called Saltine with Blake Wescott, where Ken's quiet solo songs were transformed into loud and powerful rock. The band recorded an album together late that year, but Ken later decided to break up the band and re-recorded the album with the help of studio musicians. \"Touched\" was given the unfortunate release date of September 11, 2001. Meanwhile, Jon formed a band of his own, known as the Jon Auer Band or the Jon Auer Experience. He released a pair of EPs and began work on a full-length album, which would be released in 2006 as \"Songs from the Year of Our Demise\".\n\nJon and Ken came back together in early 2000 for a one-off acoustic show in Seattle, which was recorded and released as \"In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In\". The show went so well that they decided later that year to put together a large tour of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Upon returning from the tour, they filled 2001 with a mix of solo work and a handful of live Posies shows played in support of the \"Nice Cheekbones and a Ph.D.\" EP, which was recorded the previous year.\n\nAlso released in 2000 was a four-CD box set composed almost entirely of unreleased demos, outtakes, and live tracks from throughout the Posies' career. Created mostly to satisfy fans, \"At Least, At Last\" showed many previously unseen facets of the band. The same year, DGC Records release , a compilation with songs from the band's major label years and some b-sides and covers.\n\nAfter playing drums in Jon's band, Darius Minwalla took over on drums for the Posies in early 2001. That summer, Matt Harris of Oranger replaced Joe on bass. The new rhythm section quickly learned the band's back catalog in time for a US tour that summer. The band played together sporadically over the next two years. Though comments in interviews suggested a desire to write new songs with the new lineup, new material didn't show up in live performances until 2004. They wrote and recorded a new batch of songs relatively quickly and \"Every Kind of Light\" was released in June 2005; its songs \"Love Comes\" and \"I Guess You're Right\" are included as sample music tracks in the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system. A tour of the US and Europe lasted through the end of the year. A brief Japanese tour was scheduled for the summer of 2006. In 2008 Ken and Jon undertook a Posies 20th anniversary tour, playing several shows as a duo in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nKen remarried and now lives in France with his wife and child, though he travels often to play with the Posies, Big Star, R.E.M., as well as playing in support of his solo albums. He was, as of 2008, vocalist in the band The Disciplines, the rest of whose line-up are previous members of the Norwegian band Briskeby. The Disciplines joined R.E.M. on their European tour in 2008 as a warm-up, and their song \"Yours For Taking\" was included on a CD with songs selected by R.E.M. for the March 2008 issue of \"Q magazine\".\n\nThe band released their seventh studio album \"Blood/Candy\" on September 28, 2010. The album was recorded and mixed in Spain and their hometown of Seattle, with stops in Ecuador, Canada, Paris and Los Angeles. The album release was followed by an extensive European tour in late 2010.\n\nThe reformed Big Star, which featured Auer and Stringfellow alongside musicians Jody Stephens and Alex Chilton, came to an end in March 2010 when Chilton died following a heart attack. In late 2013, The Posies played several shows, performing \"Amazing Disgrace\" in its entirety with the line-up from that era. In August 2014 the band reunited again, but with Darius Minwalla on drums and Joe Skyward on bass. Minwalla passed away unexpectedly at his home in Vancouver on May 21, 2015; and on March 26, 2016, Joe Skyward died after a two-year battle with cancer.\n\nOn March 3, 2016, the song \"Squirrel vs. Snake\" was released as a teaser for their forthcoming eighth album, and the band embarked on an extensive month-long European tour on March 29. The album \"Solid States\" was released on April 29 by British indie label Lojinx in Europe; the American release on My Music Empire followed on May 20. Drummer Frankie Siragusa, who also contributed to the engineering and mixing of the album, joined the band on tour, where they performed as a trio.\n\nIn 2018, The Posies reunited with the \"Frosting on the Beater\" lineup, with drummer Mike Musburger and bassist Dave Fox returning, for a tour of North America and Europe.\n\nIn July 2019 interview with \"Houston Chronicle\", Stringfellow revealed that The Posies have been working on new material.\n\nThe band has been compared to The Hollies due to their vocal harmonies and Big Star due to their songwriting. Ken's solo albums have been the more experimental of the band's side projects, while Jon's solo releases reside more in the power pop tradition. Both Auer and Stringfellow have been active in producing other artists in between Posies and solo projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040169", "title": "Production logo", "text": "Production logo\n\nA production logo, vanity card, vanity plate, or vanity logo is a logo used by movie studios and television production companies to brand what they produce and to determine the production company and the distributor of a television show or film. Production logos are usually seen at the beginning of a theatrical movie or video game (an \"opening logo\"), or at the end of a television program or TV movie (a \"closing logo\"). Many production logos have become famous over the years, such as the 20th Century Studios's monument and searchlights and MGM's Leo the Lion. Unlike logos for other media, production logos can take advantage of motion and synchronized sound, and almost always do.\n\nIn the early days of Hollywood, production logos and brands were simple and very much like their print counterparts, usually appearing on title cards and in the opening credits. The Paramount Pictures mountain logo hails from this era and originally featured no special effects. As the studios grew, more effort was put into their identities, and motion and sound began to be used. MGM and Universal were the first studios to take advantage of the new medium's possibilities, MGM first using Leo the Lion in 1924 and Universal debuting their globe around the same time. RKO Radio Pictures used their rotating globe and radio transmission tower with a Morse code-beeping soundtrack as early as 1929. In the 1930s, Twentieth Century Pictures introduced their futuristic \"tower\" logo, which had moving searchlights; it was carried over when they merged with Fox Film Corporation and became 20th Century-Fox. The first version of Columbia's mascot used a sparkler to represent her torch, and Universal's globes could rotate.\n\nThe advent of television in the 1950s also opened the door to cel animation in production logos. Most studios had used cels for their animation departments' logos for some time by this point, but the demand for animation on TV, both as programming and for advertising, made more effects available for less money. TV itself started using logos on its programming: Desilu, Mark VII Productions and Revue Studios all had distinctive logotypes by the end of the decade, and Desilu's and Revue's were animated. By 1976, all of the major studios except Universal had switched their logos over to cel animation, and logos for smaller concerns and broadcasters were beginning to enter the computer age, using machines like Scanimate.\n\nWith the 1980s came a return to the older style of logos. Warner Bros., one of the first studios to switch to a cel-animated abstract logo, brought back their WB shield logo as a matte painting in 1984. TV logos began switching from cels and 2D computer graphics to 3D computer graphics around the same time, and by the end of the decade, the quality of 3D animation had improved to the point that cinema quality was possible. Paramount had introduced a digital-looking logo in late 1986, but only the foreground animation in their logo was computerised (the mountain backdrop was commissioned as a painting by the company). Universal's 1990 logo, introduced for its 75th anniversary, was pre-visualized with CG, but the actual logo was created using motion-control models. Throughout the 1990s, fully computer-generated logos increased in frequency. Disney was the last of the \"Big Six\" studios to re-design their logo with computer animation, debuting their logo with the release of \"\" in 2006.\n\nBy 2007, almost all production logos have become produced (or edited) on computers, and have reached a level of sophistication equivalent to that of the best special effects. There are some exceptions; the Mutant Enemy \"grr, argh\" ID was shot using a camcorder and paper models, and the producers of \"South Park\" even recycled footage from an old Braniff Airlines ad for their \"vanity\" logo. Producer Chuck Lorre uses his production card to post a long essay or observation in small type which changes each week and requires pausing with a recording device to read.\n\nVideo games have taken on production logos as their capabilities have increased, and most modern game consoles have startup logos in their firmware. In addition, games themselves now feature (sometimes elaborate) startup logos of both the companies that produce the games as well as the ones who develop them. Video game startup logos also frequently feature the logos of game engines or other middleware used in the games. As with films, the production logos are also used in trailers and commercials for the video games.\n\nMany automobile manufacturers also use startup logos for their in car entertainment systems.\n\n"}

The tower was built in honour of German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. After Rottenbuch Radio Tower, the Jahrtausendturm, the two towers of the Brück aerial testing facility and the Blumenthal Observation Tower it was the fifth tallest wooden construction in Germany, due to the addition of two antenna measuring stations. It burned down on October 12th, 2017.\n\nIn 1867, a wooden tower was first built on the site, at that time 22 metres tall. After the First World War, this first tower had become so rickety that it had to be pulled down.\n\nIn 1931, the Goethe Tower was rebuilt with money donated by the Jewish businessman Gustav Gerst. The opening ceremony took place in November 1931, shortly before the 1932 commemorations of Goethe's death one hundred years before. The city of Frankfurt provided the wood for the tower - altogether more than 340m³ of pine, beech, and oak timber.\n\nThe Goethe Tower remained a popular place for day-trippers, especially families, as a large playground and a café were built at the foot of the tower.\nThe building was completely destroyed in a fire on 12 October 2017. It was one of Frankfurt's beloved landmarks, visited by many tourists, and city officials have already announced plans to rebuild it largely the way it was.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040174", "title": "Cry of the Banshee", "text": "Cry of the Banshee\n\nCry of the Banshee is a 1970 British horror film directed by Gordon Hessler and starring Vincent Price as an evil witchhunter. The film was released by American International Pictures. The film costars Elizabeth Bergner, Hilary Dwyer, and Hugh Griffith.\n\nThe title credit sequence was animated by Terry Gilliam.\n\nThe film is set in Elizabethan England and revolves around a wicked magistrate who tries to kill all the members of a coven of witches. It opens, like many Vincent Price movies, with a quote from Edgar Allan Poe—in this case, \"The Bells\".\n\nLord Edward Whitman (Vincent Price), as magistrate presides over the trial of a young woman. Ruling that she is a witch, he has her branded, whipped through the streets, then placed in the village stocks. That night, Lord Edward hosts a feast as his henchmen search the countryside for the killers of a sheep. Two poor and ragged-looking teenagers are pulled into the hall. A burst of wolf-like howling from outside the walls warns that they may be \"devil-marked\" and, in conflict, both teens are killed. His wife Lady Patricia (Essy Persson) calls Whitman a murderer for this. As his eldest son Sean (Stephan Chase) rapes Lady Patricia, Lord Whitman begins mumbling he wants to \"clean up\" the witches in the area.\n\nAssisted by his two older sons, Whitman goes hunting in the hills for witches. His armed posse breaks up what is apparently meant to be a witches' Black Sabbath. He kills several of them and tells the rest to scatter to the hills and never return. This angers the leader of the coven, Oona (Elizabeth Bergner). To get revenge on the Whitman clan, Oona calls up a magical servant, a \"sidhe\", to destroy the lord's family. Unfortunately, the demonic beast takes possession of the friendly, decent young servant, Roderick (Patrick Mower), that free-spirited Maureen Whitman (Hilary Dwyer) has been in love with for years. The servant turned demon begins to systematically kill off members of the Whitman family, including Sean and Lady Patricia.\n\nEventually, Harry (Carl Rigg), Whitman's son from Cambridge, and Father Tom (Marshall Jones) find Oona and her coven conjuring the death of Maureen and kill Oona. At that moment, Roderick, who was attacking Maureen, breaks off and leaves her. He soon returns and attacks Lord Edward. During this attack, Maureen shoots the demon in the head with a blunderbuss, apparently killing him.\n\nExhilarated that the curse is over, Whitman plans to leave the house with his two remaining children by coach. On the way, he stops at the cemetery, so he can reassure himself Roderick is dead. To his horror, he finds the coffin empty, and hurries back to the coach. Once inside, he finds both Harry and Maureen dead. It is revealed that Bully Boy (Andrew McCulloch), the coach's driver, was murdered by Roderick, who is now driving the coach. The film ends with Whitman screeching his driver's name in terror as the coach heads for parts unknown.\n\n\n\nWho spurs the beast the corpse will ride?\nWho cries the cry that kills?\nWhen Satan questioned, who replied?\nWhence blows this wind that chills?\nWho walks amongst these empty graves\nAnd seeks a place to lie?\n'Tis something God ne'er had planned,\nA thing that ne'er had learned to die.\n\n\nGordon Hessler did not like Tim Kelly's original script and hired Chris Wicking to rewrite it. Hessler says he would have got Wicking to change it further and improving the witch characters - but AIP would not let him.\n\nHessler said \"The film was sold and we had to have it finished by a certain time.\" He and Wicking went to Scotland to make a different picture about witches. They talked to witches and researched their history and made the witches more sympathetic.\n\nHessler says \"the whole of AIP got so alarmed because we were changing it so much. They came down on us and said that we could alter it 10 percent, but no more than that. So all of our work went down the drain on \"Cry of the Banshee\" Out of all the films I did for AIP, I think it's the least interesting.\"\n\nWicking says he saw the film as a Jacobean revenge tragedy \"but I didn't want to tell anybody that because they'd hate that.\"\n\nElisabeth Berger made her first appearance in an English film in 30 years. Hessler says AIP's head of British production \"Deke\" Hayward \"would try to find some well known actor to dress up the picture--who at least Americans would be familiar with--which was a good idea.\" For this film Hayward suggested Hessler cast Elisabeth Bergner. \"She was marvelous, out of her depths and aged at the time, and playing a very strange part. But she gave it her everything.\" Price says Berger told him she took the part \"because she wanted to be seen\".\n\nHessler thought Hilary Dwyer was under contract to AIP. \"I don't know what the situation was, but they liked her and they kept pushing you to use certain actors. I guess the management must have thought she was star material or something like that.\"\n\nFilming started November 1969. It took place at the former home of W.S. Gilbert, Harrow Weald.\n\n\"It's becoming harder and harder to scare people,\" said Price during filming. \"We still rely on the basic elements of fear: snake, rates, claustrophobia, but we're adding all the time.\"\n\nHessler remembers when they did the film Price \"was very upset with AIP\" over contractual issues. \"When we had the wrap party, he didn't want to come if Arkoff was there. I told him that I wouldn't dream of having the party without him. So he came, and of course he was quite drunk.\" Hessler says at the party everyone was in costume and a girl jumped out of a cake. \"When we were looking for the knife to cut the cake, Vincent said, \"Take the knife that's in my back and use that!\".\" (However following the making of the film, Price signed a four-picture contract with AIP over two years.)\n\nHessler wanted Bernard Herrmann to do the score but AIP could not afford him. The original music score was composed by Wilfred Josephs but AIP decided not to use it, commissioning a score by Les Baxter instead. Josephs' score was restored in the later uncut DVD releases. Hessler later said \"Wilfred Josephs' music held the picture up, it made it more mysterious.\"\n\nAIP also removed Terry Gilliam's animation credits. Hessler said, \"Deke was the one who put that animation in, always being way in advance of everyone else. About the music, I suspect that Les Baxter was a great friend of somebody high up at AIP... But to have Les Baxter do a kind of period picture where you have minuet dancing and that sort of thing, it's ludicrous.

This print was also used for the original UK cinema release in 1970.\nThe film was a commercial success but Hessler was dissatisfied with it and calls it the least interesting of the four movies he made for AIP.\n\nIn April 1991, \"Cry of the Banshee\" was packaged as a Laserdisc double feature (Catalog Number ID7661HB), paired with the first of the Count Yorga movies, \"Count Yorga, Vampire\". Both films were not letterboxed, but employed a full screen, pan-and-scan process.\n\nThe 1988 UK Guild video release featured the same heavily edited print as the US and UK cinema ones. All DVD releases, however, have featured the full uncut version, which also restores the original Wilfred Josephs music score.\n\n"}

He was the president and one of the founders of NFL Films, along with his father Ed. He was also a widely exhibited visual artist.\n\nSabol was born in Moorestown, New Jersey and attended Colorado College, where he played football and was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was the subject of a humorous article about his self-promotion exploits in the November 22, 1965, issue of \"Sports Illustrated\". He began working at NFL Films as a cameraman alongside his father Ed Sabol (1916–2015) after graduation. He started in the filming industry when his father got the rights to the 1962 NFL Championship Game, played in Yankee Stadium on December 30.\n\nThis company eventually grew into NFL Films, with Sabol serving mainly as a cameraman, editor, and writer in the 1960s and 1970s. When ESPN was founded in 1979, they soon signed NFL Films as a production company and Sabol became an on-air personality in the 1980s. He won 35 Emmy Awards and had a documentary about him air on \"60 Minutes\". Sabol played a part in founding the NFL Network.\n\nSabol was the author of the poem \"The Autumn Wind\", later adopted by the Oakland Raiders as an unofficial anthem.\n\nAs president of the most honored filmmaker in sports, Sabol continued to be the artistic vision behind the studio that revolutionized the way America watches football. Sabol and his father, Ed, who was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 5, 2011, were honored in 2003 with the Lifetime Achievement Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for \"revolutionizing the way America watches football and setting the standard in sports filmmaking.\"\n\nWhile NFL Films has won over 100 Emmys, Sabol himself has received 35 of those Emmys for writing, cinematography, editing, directing, and producing. No one else in all of television has earned as many Emmys in as many different categories.\n\nBuilding on the entrepreneurial spirit of his father and founder of NFL Films, Sabol was named the 2002 Sports Executive of the Year by \"Sporting News\" magazine. Sabol also received the prestigious Pete Rozelle Award, which is presented each year to someone who has made an outstanding contribution to the National Football League and to professional football. He joins a select group of honorees including: Vince Lombardi, Dan Rooney, Lamar Hunt, Tom Landry, and Don Shula.\n\nIn 2007, the Pro Football Hall of Fame honored Sabol with the Dan Reeves Pioneer Award recognizing his innovative ideas that have contributed to the game of professional football.

{"id": "2040203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040203", "title": "Old Mortality", "text": "Old Mortality\n\nOld Mortality is a novel by Walter Scott set in the period 1679–89 in south west Scotland. It forms, along with \"The Black Dwarf\", the 1st series of Scott's \"Tales of My Landlord\". The two novels were published together in 1816. \"Old Mortality\" is considered one of Scott's best novels.\n\nScott's original title was \"The Tale of Old Mortality\", but is generally shortened in most references.\n\nOn 30 April 1816 Scott signed a contract with William Blackwood for a four-volume work of fiction, and on 22 August, James Ballantyne, Scott's printer and partner, indicated to Blackwood that it was to be entitled \"Tales of My Landlord\", which was planned to consist of four tales relating to four regions of Scotland. In the event the second tale, \"Old Mortality\", expanded to take up the final three volumes, leaving \"The Black Dwarf\" as the only story to appear exactly as intended. Scott completed \"The Black Dwarf\" in August, and composed \"Old Mortality\" during the next three months.\n\nScott was steeped in 17th-century literature. Among the printed sources drawn on for \"The Tale of Old Mortality\" the following may be singled out for special mention:\n\n\"Old Mortality\" appeared as the second, third, and fourth volumes of \"Tales of My Landlord\", published by Blackwood's in Edinburgh on 2 December and by John Murray in London three days later. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The title-page indicated that the \"Tales\" were 'collected and arranged by Jedediah Cleishbotham', reinforcing the sense of a new venture moving on from the first three novels with 'the Author of Waverley' and his publishers, Archibald Constable in Edinburgh and Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown in London. Two further editions with minor changes followed in the next two months. There is no clear evidence for authorial involvement in these, or in any of the novel's subsequent appearances except for the 18mo \"Novels and Tales\" (1823) and the 'Magnum' edition. Some of the small changes to the text in 1823 are attributable to Scott, but that edition was a textual dead end. In October 1828 he provided the novel with an introduction and notes, and revised the text, for the Magnum edition in which it appeared in February to April 1830 as part of the ninth volume, the whole of the tenth, and part of the eleventh. The standard modern edition, by Douglas Mack, was published with Scott's apparently preferred title \"The Tale of Old Mortality\", as Volume 4b of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1993: this is based on the first edition with emendations from manuscript and the editions immediately following the initial publication; the Magnum material appears in Volume 25a.\n\nAfter an \"Introduction to the Tales of My Landlord\", supposedly written by the novel's (fictional) editor Jedediah Cleishbotham, the first chapter by the (fictional) author Peter Pattieson describes Robert Paterson ('Old Mortality'), a Scotsman of the 18th century, who late in life decided to travel around Scotland re-engraving the tombs of 17th-century Covenanter martyrs. Pattieson describes at length meeting Robert Paterson, hearing his anecdotes, and finding other stories of the events to present an unbiased picture.\n\nThe novel then describes a wapenshaw held in 1679 by Lady Margaret Bellenden, life-rentrix of the barony of Tillietudlem. This was a show of her support for the Royalist cause, but most of her tenants favoured the opposing Covenanters (who wanted the re-establishment of presbyterianism in Scotland) and she has to enlist her unwilling servants. After her supporters are duly mustered, the main sport is a shoot at the popinjay in which the Cavalier favourite is narrowly defeated by Henry Morton, son of a Covenanter. He is introduced to Lady Margaret and her lovely granddaughter Edith Bellenden, with whom he is in love.\n\nDuring celebrations of his popinjay victory in the inn that evening, Morton stands up for John Balfour of Burley against bullying by Cavalier dragoons. That night, Burley seeks shelter at Morton's house; Morton reluctantly agrees. It emerges that Burley was one of the assassins of Archbishop James Sharp. In the morning they have to flee Cavalier patrols. As a consequence, Morton finds himself outlawed, and joins Burley in the uprising at the Battle of Drumclog, at which group of around 200 armed Covenanters moved east, to a boggy moor near the farm of Drumclog. With about 40 mounted men, and armed with muskets and pitchforks, the Covenanter force was no rabble, and eventually charges round the edge of a bog or 'stank', routing the dragoons from the battlefield and leaving 36 dead. However, after this initial success, Scott traces the growth of factionalism, which hastened its defeat at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, by forces led by the Duke of Monmouth and John Graham of Claverhouse.\n\nHenry Morton's involvement in the rebellion causes a conflict of loyalties for him, since Edith Bellenden belongs to a Royalist family who oppose the uprising. Henry's beliefs are not as extreme as those of Burley and many other rebel leaders, which leads to his involvement in the factional disputes. The novel also shows their oppressors, led by Claverhouse, to be extreme in their beliefs and methods. Comic relief is provided by Cuddie Headrigg, a peasant who works as a manservant to Morton. He reluctantly joins the rebellion because of his personal loyalty to Morton, as well as his own fanatical Covenanting mother, Mause Headrigg.\n\nFollowing the defeat at Bothwell Bridge, Morton flees the battle field. He is soon captured by some of the extreme Covenanters, who see him as a traitor, and get ready to execute him. He is rescued by Claverhouse, who has been led to the scene by Cuddie Headrigg. Morton later witnesses the trial and torture of fellow rebels, before going into exile.\n\nThe novel ends with Morton returning to Scotland in 1689 to find a changed political and religious climate following the overthrow of James VII, and to be reconciled with Edith.\n\n\"Principal characters in bold\"\n\nMr Morton of Milnewood, a Presbyterian\n\nHenry Morton, his nephew\n\nAlison Wilson, his housekeeper\n\nLady Margaret Bellenden of Tillietudlem\n\nEdith, her grand-daughter\n\nMajor Bellenden, her brother-in-law\n\nGudyill, her butler\n\nGoose Gibbie, her half-witted servant \n\nJenny Dennison, Edith's maid\n\nMause Headrigg\n\nCuddie, her son\n\nLord Evandale\n\nLady Emily Hamilton, his sister\n\nNiel Blane, a publican\n\nJenny, his daughter\n\nJohn Grahame of Claverhouse\n\nFrancis Stuart, Earl of Bothwell, his sergeant\n\nCornet Richard Grahame, his nephew\n\nTam Halliday, Bothwell's comrade\n\nGabriel Kettledrummle, Peter Poundtext, Ephraim Macbriar, and Habbakuk Mucklewraith, Covenanting preachers\n\nJohn Balfour or Burley, a Covenanter\n\nThe Duke of Monmouth\n\nGeneral Dalzell, his aide-de-camp\n\nThe Duke of Lauderdale\n\nBasil Olifant\n\nBessie MacClure\n\nPeggy, her grand-daughter\n\nWittenbold, a Dutch dragoon commander\n\nVolume One\n\nCh. 1: An assistant schoolmaster at Gandercleugh Peter Pattieson tells of his encounter with Old Mortality repairing Covenanters' gravestones, and of the stories he told that form the basis of the following narrative.\n\nCh. 2: Lady Margaret Bellenden has difficulty in finding enough willing servants to fulfil her obligation to send a prescribed number to the wappen-schaw (muster).\n\nCh. 3: At the wappen-schaw Henry Morton wins the contest of shooting at the popinjay (parrot), defeating Lord Evandale and a young plebeian [later identified as Cuddie Headrigg], and Lady Margaret's half-witted servant Goose Gibbie takes a tumble.\n\nCh. 4: At Niel Blane's inn John Balfour (or Burley) defeats Bothwell in a wrestling bout.

The character of Henry Morton is fictional, as is Tillietudlem Castle, but readers identified the place with Craignethan Castle which Scott had visited. This castle soon attracted literary tourists, and a railway halt built nearby became the hamlet of Tillietudlem.\n\nMost of the reviewers rated \"Old Mortality\" considerably higher than \"The Black Dwarf\", with particular appreciation of the characters and descriptions, though there were several objections to the weakness of the hero Henry Morton. Although four critics, including Francis Jeffrey in \"The Edinburgh Review\", judged the presentation of the Covenanters and the royalists to be fair, there were several assertions that the Covenanters were caricatured and the royalists whitewashed, most notably in a long (and otherwise generally appreciative) article by the Rev. Thomas McCrie the elder in \"The Edinburgh Christian Instructor\". Scott himself responded indirectly to McCrie's criticisms in an anonymous self-review for \"The Quarterly Review\". \"The Eclectic Review\" accused Scott of distorting and diminishing history for the sake of amusing his readers, while admitting he did it well.\n\nThe play \"Têtes rondes et Cavaliers\" (1833) by Jacques-François Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine is based on Scott's novel.\n\nVincenzo Bellini's opera \"I puritani\" (1835), with a libretto written by Italian emigre in Paris, Count Carlo Pepoli, is in turn based on that play. It has become one of Bellini's major operas.\n\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon's poem is effectively a eulogy on Sir Walter Scott himself following his death in Italy.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040206", "title": "Francisco Moreno", "text": "Francisco Moreno\n\nFrancisco Pascasio Moreno (May 31, 1852 – November 22, 1919) was a prominent explorer and academic in Argentina, where he is usually referred to as \"Perito\" Moreno (\"perito\" means \"specialist, expert\"). Perito Moreno has been credited as one of the most influential figures in the Argentine incorporation of large parts of Patagonia and its subsequent development.\n\nMoreno was born to Francisco and Juana Thwaites Madero in Buenos Aires. Raised in a traditional patrician family, he studied in local parochial schools. He shared his spare time with his father searching for artifacts and fossils and, at age 14, created a homemade museum of his extensive collections.\n\nFollowing graduation in 1872, he participated in the founding of the Argentine Scientific Society. He embarked on the first of the series of scientific expeditions that made him well known: a survey of Río Negro Territory, largely uncharted country. In January 1876, he reached Lake Nahuel-Huapi in the southern Andes, and on February 15, 1877, he discovered and named Lake Argentino. He also explored numerous rivers in Patagonia. On March 2, he discovered and named Mount Fitz Roy, after the commander of the expedition of in the 1830s. The native people also called it \"Chalten\".\nIn 1880, Moreno went to France, where he spoke at a meeting of the Anthropology Society of Paris, discussing two prehistoric skulls he had unearthed in Río Negro territory. He believed one was from the Quaternary period, and the other had ritual deformation in a manner similar to the skulls of the Aymara people of the Andes and Altiplano.\n\nAfter his return to Argentina, that year he embarked on his second major expedition to the territory of Patagonia. He was taken prisoner by a Tehuelche aboriginal tribe and condemned to death. He escaped on March 11, one day before the appointed execution. During this period he met the Tehuelche chief, Inacayal, who was hospitable to him. Later Inacayal led a resistance to the government, not surrendering until 1884.\n\nIn 1882–1883 Moreno explored the Andes from Bolivia southward, and in 1884–1885 he made new explorations of the territory south of the Río Negro and of Patagonia. He was appointed as chief of the Argentine exploring commission of the southern territories, and member of numerous European scientific societies. For his contributions to science, Moreno received a doctorate \"Honoris causa\" from the National University of Córdoba in 1877.\n\nHe is also known for his role in defending Argentine interests. He made defining surveys that led to the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina. In honor to this contribution, the Argentinian glacier Perito Moreno, was named after him. These surveys and others yielded Moreno a vast collection of archaeological and anthropological data and artifacts, for which he founded an anthropological museum in Buenos Aires in 1877.\n\nIn 1888, he founded the La Plata Museum of Natural History, the most important of its kind in South America. The scholar Jens Andermann has studied how Moreno's collection of artifacts at these two museums helped establish Argentine history, and the government's claim to its territory. Through these scientific and cultural collections, Moreno contributed to the national mythology. He brought artifacts and materials in from remote regions to be examined, catalogued and studies at the museum in the capital. Andermann has written that such museums of natural history and anthropology \"enabled and justified state control of both the natural resources and indigenous populations of Argentina.\" They also helped develop the national narratives being shaped. Moreno served as the first Director of Museo de la Plata, guiding it until 1906.\n\nAs director of La Plata Museum of Natural History Moreno sacked Florentino Ameghino in 1888 even denying him entry to the museum.\n\nIn 1902 Moreno was appointed \"Perito\" (a technical specialist or expert), in which capacity he disproved Chilean claims to the continental divide in the Southern Cone. Moreno proved that many Patagonian lakes draining to the Pacific Ocean were part of the Atlantic Ocean basin. During the quaternary glaciations, they had become dammed by moraines, which changed their outlets to drain to the west and Chilean territory.\n\nIn 1903, Moreno donated some of the land previously given to him in order to establish the Nahuel Huapi National Park. He was appointed Assistant Director of the National Education Council in 1911 and helped secure funding for the Bernasconi Institute, a landmark primary school built in Buenos Aires. It was constructed on land Moreno sold to Swiss Argentine industrialist Félix Bernasconi. Its archaeological and natural history museums were created in part with his extensive collections of artifacts.\n\nHe established the Scouting and Guiding in Argentina, the Argentine Boy Scouts Association in 1912, and joined former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in a tour of Patagonia. He continued to oversee the La Plata Museum well after his official retirement.\n\nIn later years Moreno responded to political developments in South America at the time of World War I by joining the reactionary Argentine Patriotic League shortly before his death in 1919. Moreno was first interred in a La Recoleta Cemetery crypt. In 1944 his remains were transferred and reinterred at Centinela Isle in Lake Nahuel Huapi.\n\nA species of Argentinian lizard, \"Liolaemus morenoi\", is named in his honor.\n\n"}

It is the largest of the Berlin lakes by area, with an area of , a length of and a breadth of .\n\nThe lake is in the Berlin district of Treptow-Köpenick. The suburbs of Köpenick, Friedrichshagen, Rahnsdorf and a little section of Müggelheim border on the lake.\n\nThe lake itself is deep at its deepest point. At its south end are hills called the 'Müggelberge', which are high; they were formed during the Pleistocene (as a kettle hole, remaining at Weichselian glaciation). On the so-called 'Kleiner Müggelberg', the much-visited and popular 'Müggelturm' (a tower) was built, the first one in 1889 (destroyed in a fire in 1958), and the current one in 1960/61. The tower offers extensive views over the lake and the forests against the Berlin skyline.\n\nThe River Spree flows into the lake via the smaller Kleiner Müggelsee, which is only in area. The Friedrichshagen waterworks on the northern bank of the Müggelsee obtains most of its water from the lake. There are also numerous deep wells located near the banks, and are mainly fed by the bank filtrate and only to a small share by groundwater.\n\nThe first uses of the word component \"Müggel\" are, according to Gerhard Schlimpert in the \"Codex diplomaticus Brandenburgensis\", in 1394 as \"den Tyns in der Miggel\" and in 1487 as \"von der Miggelseh\". The etymology remains unclear. The traditional derivative from Common Slavonic \"mogyla\" = \"grave, grave hill, earth hill\" is rejected by Schlimpert as not durable. A pre-Slavonic, Germanic origin from a Proto-Indo-European root is more probable: \"migh-\", \"mighla\" = \"fog, cloud\": compare Dutch \"miggelen\" = \"drizzle\" belongs. Analyses say that the word component \"heim\" in the name was brought around 1750 by settlers from the Palatinate from their homeland Odernheim, according to Schlimpert.\n\nIn December 2013, a lake on the Saturnian moon Titan was officially named after Lake Müggelsee by the International Astronomical Union. That \"lake\" is composed of liquid methane and ethane, and is located at 84°26N and 203°30W on Titan's globe.\n"}

{"id": "2040259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040259", "title": "Rockdale railway station", "text": "Rockdale railway station\n\nRockdale railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Illawarra line, serving the Sydney suburb of Rockdale in Bayside Council. It is served by Sydney Trains T4 line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nRockdale station opened on 15 October 1884 on the same date as the Illawarra line from Redfern to Hurstville with two side platforms. At the opening of Rockdale Railway Station, a goods shed and siding was provided on the eastern side.\n\nRockdale station is unusual in that it initially provided a rail connection for coal transfer and passengers for Saywell's Private Tramway. This was originally a steam powered tramway operation, which began running from Rockdale to Brighton on Botany Bay from 1885. In 1887 another tramway service from Rockdale to Sans Souci began operation. In 1899 Thomas Saywell converted his steam trams to electricity. In 1937 the tram service from Rockdale to Sans Souci was replaced by a trolley bus service, and the tramway to Brighton closed in 1938. In the latter years of the tramway's operation, the rail connection was also used for the transfer of Departmental rolling stock to the tramways in the area.\n\nIn 1907, the northbound platform was converted to an island with a new southbound track. The former southbound track (current Platform 4) became the northbound track, with the former southbound platform (current Platform 3) becoming a refuge siding.\n\nIn 1908, Platform 3 was converted to an island platform and an additional track laid along its western face. Rockdale now had four platform numbers. In 1923, a terminus platform (current Platform 1) was erected, when the Illawarra line was quadruplicated from Wolli Creek and the level crossing at Frederick Street was replaced by a bridge.\n\nDuring the 1920s a siding for the State Meat Depot was added to Rockdale Railway Station, as was the Municipal Council's siding in 1923. In 1928 a siding was added for the small companies of Carroll Lynn and finally the Warne Family Company.\n\nIn 1920 a steel footbridge from the Maitland District was re-erected, followed in 1922 by the timber overhead booking office. In 1923 quadruplication of the line was undertaken, and new platforms added for the quadruplication. The original signal box was built on the north end of Platform 2-3 but in 1923 was replaced by the present (disused) brick elevated box on the western side of the line, east of the T junction of Railway Street and Oakura Street. Also in 1923 a new Platform No. 1 with brick waiting shed was built along with another siding, both having \"dead-end\" sidings for carriage storage. In 1926 the lines were electrified, and the tramway link was disconnected in 1938.\n\nThere were only relatively minor changes until abolition of the goods yard in 1979.\n\nIn February 1993 Rockdale Signal Box was abolished. Its frame consisted of a combination of pistol grip and large mechanical levers, the last example in New South Wales.\n\nIn 2005 alterations were undertaken to the station to install lifts and new access stairs and additional platform and stair canopies, and canopies to the overhead footbridge and station entrance areas.\n\nThe 1925 power signal box and dead-end sidings and remains of structures relating to goods sidings and tram rolling stock, are no longer extant.\n\nTransdev NSW operate two routes to and from Rockdale station:\n\nTransit Systems operate ten routes via Rockdale station:\n\nRockdale station is served by three NightRide routes:\n\nThe heritage-listed station precinct includes the Platform 1 building (1925), the Platform 2/3 building (1908), the Platform 4/5 building (1884), the overhead booking office (1922), the footbridge (1920), the platforms and the Signal Box (1923).\n\nRockdale Railway Station is located between Railway Street on the west and Geeves Avenue on the east and is accessed from both streets via a footbridge, stairs and modern lifts. The station has three island platforms. Along both Railway Street and Geeves Avenue adjacent to the station are extensive bus shelters. Adjacent and to the south of the western entry to the station (off Railway Street) is a distinctive 2-storey brick Inter-War Functionalist style retail building.\n\nA small brick platform building with an unpainted brick wall on the main west elevation, and painted brickwork on the other elevations. The building is built to the platform edge on the east side. The building has a gabled corrugated steel roof, with gable ends to north and south, and a cantilevered awning on the west side only. The awning is on steel brackets mounted on stucco brackets and features timber valences at each end. The building features rectangular timber louvred vents to the gable ends. There are three timber framed double hung windows covered over on the east elevation. The building's west elevation features stucco mouldings, and timber double doors with glazed upper panels. An old telephone is mounted on the west elevation, below the awning.\n\nThe island platform building is a painted brick building with a gabled corrugated steel roof, with gable ends at north and south ends. There are no extant chimneys. The building has cantilevered awnings on east and west sides mounted on steel brackets in turn mounted on stucco wall brackets. The building has timber framed double hung windows with 16-pane top sashes with multicoloured glazing and timber 4 panel doors. There are moulded stucco sills to windows. The awnings have timber valances at north and south ends. There is one 8-paned fanlight above a timber 4 panel door which appears original.\n\nThe interior features timber tongue and grooved, and later gyprock ceilings, and a chimney breast to one room.\n\nThe island Platform 4/5 building has painted brick walls. The building has a complex gabled corrugated steel clad roof form with two central gables, gables at north and south ends, and pairs of gablets near the north and south ends. There are no extant chimneys. The building features arched openings; one pair of original timber panelled double doors; narrow, tall, timber framed double hung windows and timber 4-panel doors with most fanlights covered over. The building features painted sandstone sills to windows. Both east and west sides of the building have skillion corrugated steel roofed awnings on cast iron posts with cast iron friezes and brackets.\n\nAt the northern end of the platform is a separate small painted brick detached wing with a gabled roof (with the roof ridge in a transverse direction to the main roof ridge of the platform building), with gable ends to east and west. The roof is corrugated steel. The building features timber framed double hung windows. There is a modern awning structure wrapping around the north and west sides of the building. The asphalt platform surface is raised from the original height and partially covers some building vents. There are modern steel security screens to windows and doors.\n\nThe Station Managers' office in the Platform 4/5 building (which appears to be converted from a waiting room) has an original fanlight with two vertical glazing bars, an original plaster ceiling with plaster ceiling rose, and an original chimney breast (though no fireplace).\n\nA weatherboard building with a hipped corrugated steel roof with a large gable facing Platform 2/3 to the north. The building features, timber framed double hung windows with 9 paned top sashes featuring multicoloured glazing. A modern awning cuts across the top of the top sashes of the windows on the north side of the building.\n\nSteel, two sets of taper-haunched girders, one set for street access, the other for platform interchange. The footbridge is located towards the southern end of the platforms. The steel footbridge structure, steps, step railings and posts with star pattern detail, are original, manufactured by Dorman Long & Co., however modern railings have been added to the footbridge. The footbridge supports the weatherboard overhead booking office (1920), and modern corrugated steel clad entry buildings and lifts have been constructed at east and west ends.\n\nThree island platforms, all with asphalt surfaces and brick faces. Platform 1 abuts the rail tracks on the east side, and has white powder coated aluminium fencing preventing access on the east side.\n\nVarious modern platform canopies with steel posts with concrete bases and green corrugated Colorbond gabled roofs. Platform 2/3: A platform canopy structure leads from the platform entry stairs at the southern end of the platform to the platform building. There is also a platform canopy north of the platform building. Platform 4/5: A platform canopy leads from the platform entry stairs at the southern end to the main platform building. There is also a platform canopy wrapping around the north and west sides of the separate small building at the northern end of the platform.\n\nTwo storey signal box with brick ground floor and fibro walls to 1st floor, hipped corrugated steel roof. Windows are timber-framed. Two metal stairs give access to a deck along the west elevation.\n\nShrub and tree plantings at northern end of platforms.\n\nOld telephone attached to west wall of Platform 1 building.\n\nThe buildings on platforms 1, 2/3 and 4/5, the overhead booking office, the platforms and the 1920 footbridge have been reported to be in good condition, while the signal box is in moderate condition.\n\nThe platform buildings are relatively intact externally. Original internal features are extant to Platform 2/3 and 4/5 buildings. The overhead booking office is one of the more intact such structures on the Illawarra line.\n\nRockdale Railway Station - including Platforms 1-5 and all platform buildings, footbridge, overhead booking office and signal box - is of State heritage significance. The collection of station structures at Rockdale is considered to be of State significance as a very intact collection dating from 1887, including one of the most intact of five extant 1887 3rd class brick platform buildings on the Illawarra line (Platform 4/5 building) and a rare platform building built for a tramway.\n\nRockdale Railway Station is of historical significance as an important station on the Illawarra line developed from 1884 as a major transport hub to the Rockdale area.

{"id": "2040288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040288", "title": "Observation tower", "text": "Observation tower\n\nAn observation tower is a structure used to view events from a long distance and to create a full 360 degree range of vision to conduct the long distance observations. They are usually at least tall and made from stone, iron, and wood. Many modern towers are also used as TV towers, restaurants, or churches. The towers first appeared in the ancient world, as long ago as the Babylonian Empire.\n\nObservation towers that are used as guard posts or observation posts over an extended period to overlook an area are commonly called watchtowers instead.\n\nObservation towers are an easily visible sight on the countryside, as they must rise over trees and other obstacles to ensure clear vision. Older control rooms have often been likened to medieval chambers. The heavy use of stone, iron, and wood in their construction helps to create this illusion. Modern towers frequently have observation decks or terraces with restaurants or on the roof of mountain stations of an aerial ropeway. Frequently observation towers are used also as location of radio services within the UHF/VHF range (FM sound broadcasting, TV, public rural broadcasting service, and portable radio service). In some cases this usage of the tower is at least as important as its use as an observation tower. Such towers are usually called TV towers or telecommunication towers. Many towers are also equipped with a tower restaurant and allow visitors access via elevators. Also common is the usage of water towers as observation towers. As in the case of TV towers the visitor will usually reach the observation deck by elevator, which is usually at a lower height above ground The typical height of the observation deck of water towers is 20 metres up to 50 metres, while the typical height of the platform of TV towers is from 80 metres up to 200 metres. Finally, some church towers may have observation decks, albeit often without an elevator. Many other buildings may have towers which allow for observation.\n\nIn particular prior to World War I rambler associations, and some municipalities, built observation towers on numerous summits. Usually these towers were built of stone, however sometimes wood or iron was also used. At nearly all these towers access to the observation deck, usually at a height of between 5 and 40 metres, is only possible by way of stairs. Most of these towers are used only for tourism, however some of these towers might also be used, at times of high forest fire risk, as fire observation posts or in times of war as military observation posts with anti-aircraft positions placed beside it. Further uses were not intended at most of these buildings, although some of these towers today now carry antennas for police/fire engine radios, portable radio or low power FM- and TV-transmitters. Older observation towers frequently have a flag pole at its top.\n\nSome of these towers are permanently accessible, either free or with the payment of an admission fee. Others are accessible only at certain times, in most cases only with the payment of an admission fee. At these towers the platform is usually open, with some having a restaurant in the basement. There are also towers with a much more extensive use; for example. the observation tower on Rossberg mountains in Reutlingen contains a hotel within its structure.\n\nAlthough most of these towers were initially built before World War I, such structures are still being built, in particular as attractions at horticultural shows. Modern observation towers are in most cases no longer built of brick, but concrete, steel and wood are used as the preferred building materials.\n\nPermanent observation towers are also sometimes found in amusement parks, however in parks where each attraction is not separately paid for, panorama rides are preferred.\n\nWatch towers are observation towers, on which persons supervise a larger area. Strictly speaking, control towers also fall into this category, although surveillance from these structures is mostly done in a non-optical way using Radar. Watch towers usually have a closed pulpit to protect the observer against bad weather. Watch towers do not have an elevator as a rule, since these buildings are mostly not higher than 20 metres. Active watch towers are not as a rule accessible to the public, since they usually serve for the monitoring of sensitive ranges. However watch towers can be quite ordered for forest fire monitoring a platform accessible for the public or be used during times without forest fire risk as observation towers. Shut down watch towers can however be easily converted to observation towers.\n\nAlso some radio towers were so built that they can be used apart from their function as transmitting tower also as observation tower. A condition for this is a sufficiently stable construction, which permits a permanent safe visitor entrance without interruption of the transmission services. This is the case for towers for radio services in the UHF/VHF-range the case, not however for most types of radio towers for long and medium wave, why a use of these structures as observation tower is impossible in most cases. That the use of a tower as radio tower for medium wave and observation tower not well fits, showed up in Radio Tower Berlin, which originally carried together with an 80 metres high mast a t-antenna for medium wave and stands on insulators. However one notices at the first experimental transmissions that at the tower voltages would arise, which would have unpleasant consequences for visitors and so the tower was grounded by the elevator shaft. However this shifted direction of main beam of transmitter away from actual supply area, the city of Berlin. As before World War II nearly whole radio traffic took place in the long -, medium and shortwave range, first after World War II with introduction of radio services in UHF/VHF-range required towers only acting as antenna carriers, radio towers with observation decks built. For this the closed reinforced concrete construction way was nearly always used. Radio towers with observation decks often serve for TV transmission or for radio relay link services and are called therefore usually TV tower or telecommunication tower. As a rule an elevator is available in these buildings for the visitors of the observation deck, as the observation deck lies usually very highly (mostly within the range between 50 and 200 metres, at some towers also more highly). Many of these towers have also a tower restaurant, which can be designed as revolving restaurant. While tower restaurants for the protection of the restaurant guests from the wind are in closed rooms, the prospect platform can be open or in a closed room. An open platform is more favourable for photographing, since no reflexes at the disk arise, while closed platforms are for many visitors more pleasant. Prospect outlooks on TV towers are opened only at certain times and their entrance is possible only under payment of an admission fee.\n\nAlso numerous highrise buildings have observation decks, sometimes even a restaurant. The height of these platforms, which can be glassed or open-air depend on the height of the building, where they are most common on the utmost floor. As a rule the access, that nearly always requires the payment of an admission fee, is possible by elevator and is only possible at dedicated opening times.\n\nAlso numerous water towers have, a usually open-air observation deck opened for public traffic, whose height is mostly as the height of older observation towers in the height range between 10 and 50 metres. It can be reached depending upon tower by stairs or by an elevator. Some water towers have also a tower restaurant. Prospect platforms of water towers are nearly only accessible under payment during the opening times, which are different for each tower.\n\nAlso some church towers possess observation decks. However elevators are only available in rare cases. The entrance of this platform is in contrast to the entrance of the church usually only possible under payment an admission fee at the opening times of the church. The height of the observation decks is usually in the range between 20 and 50 metres. The platform is nearly always open-air.\n\nSome lighthouses have an observation deck open to the public. Access is usually by stairs. An admission fee is often charged and hours may be limited. The observation deck of a lighthouse is usually between 10 and 50 metres high, and is almost always open air.\n\nSome sports facilities have high buildings with observation decks. This is often the case at ski jumps, as these have a tower and are usually unused in the summer. In addition, there are other sports facilities with observation decks, like the inclined tower of the Montreal Olympic stadium. Access to the platform of nearly all sports facilities with observation deck is only possible during opening times after paying an admission fee. Depending upon the building the access can be done by an elevator and/or a stairway. The platforms can be vitreous or open. The height above ground lies usually between 10 and 50 metres.\n\nFire lookout towers have been used widely in Australia, Canada, and the United States to hoist fire lookout persons to heights where they can identify and report new wildfires. In the United States, there once were over 5,000 fire lookout towers.\n\nThere are also some very unusual observation towers, which fit not well into one of these categories. Examples for this are the Henninger Turm, a grain silo with tower restaurant and observation deck in Frankfurt, the bell tower of Berlin Olympic stadium, whose platform is accessible by an elevator, the winding tower of the mining industry museum in Bochum, which has an open-air observation deck to which an elevator runs or a wind turbine in Holtriem wind park, which is equipped with a closed platform accessible over stairs. Also aerial tramway support towers, which serve as observation tower (and aerial tramway station), were realized, like Torre Jaume I in Barcelona. Even on the pylons of suspension bridges were already observation decks installed, as the example of Nový Most in Bratislava shows.\nA very unusual observation tower is Pont basculant de la Seyne-sur-Mer. It was once a bascule bridge, now permanently put upright and used as observation tower.\n\nIn Germany, observation towers first appeared on the countryside at the end of the 18th century. These early towers were often built by wealthy aristocrats. It wasn't until the mid-19th century that citizens took control of the construction of such towers. In Austria and Switzerland many observation towers were established by alpine and tourist associations, and continue to be cared for by them. In the Waldigen Mountains, many citizen committees were active. Because of the long reign of emperor Franz Joseph, many observation decks carry the name \"anniversary observation platform\". The invention of the elevator in the late 19th century made taller observation decks possible. Most notably, the Eiffel Tower and the Blackpool Tower were built in this era. Radio towers developed as combined sending and observation tower between 1924 and 1926 in the city of Berlin. After World War II, a great need for tall observation towers arose, due to their dual usage as television and radio transmitters. In large cities, the desire existed to provide these towers with a tower restaurant and an observation deck, in order to make the building of towers more economical via admission fees and increased notability. Several water towers were also built with this in mind, but many have not survived to the modern day.\n\nThe Pyramidenkogel tower, the tallest wooden tower in the world is tall and rests atop the Pyramidenkogel mountain in Carinthia, Austria. Another observation tower sits atop the Gallitzinberg forest which in 1956 replaced an older steel tower that had been erected in 1899. Therefore, the present tower is still colloquially known as the Jubiläumswarte (\"jubilee tower\"). Its topmost platform, above ground, offers an impressive panorama of Vienna.\n\nThe CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario is one of the world's tallest observation towers. It previously held the title of tallest free standing structure in the world until 2010 where it was surpassed by the completion of the Canton Tower. Skylon Tower in Niagara Falls, and Calgary Tower are also notable.\n\nThe best known observation, radio and television tower is the Eiffel tower (1887-1889) in Paris, standing tall. There is the July Column (1835-1840) in Paris, a commemorative column, standing tall, the Perret tower (1924-1925) in Grenoble standing tall, the Belvédère tower (1898) in Mulhouse standing tall.\n\nRadio Tower Berlin is a radio tower in Berlin, standing 150 meters tall. It was built by Straumer, and has a steel lattice construction. It was inaugurated on September 3, 1926. The first worldwide FM radio programs were broadcast from this tower. It also broadcast the first regular television program, the 1936 Summer Olympics.\n\nHenninger Turm is the world's only silo tower with an observation deck accessible to the public.\n\nWindpark Holtriem is one of the few wind turbines with an observation deck accessible to the public.\n\nMilad Tower is a tower in Tehran. It stands at from base to the tip of the antenna.\n\nThe Euromast in Rotterdam gives a splendid view over the largest port in Europe. The observation deck is at while the rotating lift reaches .\n\nTorre Jaume I is a support pillar of the aerial tramway in Barcelona. It is equipped with an observation deck.\n\nThe Blackpool Tower (still standing) and the New Brighton Tower (demolished) resembled smaller versions of the Eiffel Tower, while Watkin's Tower at Wembley, if completed, would have been taller than the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe i360 in Brighton is a observation tower and the world's first vertical cable car.\n\nEnger Tower,\nReunion Tower, Seattle's Space Needle, Gatlinburg, Tennessee's Space Needle\nand the Tower of the Americas are some examples of observation towers in the United States.

He was most recently the Director of Pitching Development for the Baltimore Orioles. He was a pitcher in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, but is most notable as the pitching coach for the Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, and the Milwaukee Brewers. Peterson is known for his unique use of biomechanical research and psychological principles to help pitchers improve their pitching motions. His nicknames include \"The Jacket\" (because he always wears a jacket during games) and \"The Professor.\" He's also known for placing his hand on the shoulder of the pitcher during mound visits.\n\nPeterson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He graduated from Mt. Lebanon High School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore Orioles drafted him out of high school, but instead of signing with the Orioles, he chose to go to Gulf Coast Junior College in Panama City, Florida. He then attended Jacksonville University and graduated with a combined degree in psychology and art.\n\nPeterson was drafted for the second time in the 21st round of the June 1976 free agent draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. At that time, his father, Pete Peterson, was Pittsburgh's farm system director and future general manager. Rick Peterson played in class-A for the Pirates organization for four years, in 1976–79, and also made appearances at higher levels of the minors in 1982, 1983 and 1988.\n\nPeterson began his coaching career in Minor League Baseball when he coached with the single-A Salem Pirates (now Salem Avalanche) of the Carolina League from 1979 to 1980. In 1980, he was part of the coaching staff with the (R) Gulf Coast Pirates of the Gulf Coast League. From 1981 to 1982, Peterson was with the (AA) Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern League. After his stay in Buffalo, he got a coaching position with the (AA) Lynn Sailors of the Eastern League in 1983.\n\nIn 1984, Peterson became the bullpen coach of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Peterson held this coaching job with the Pirates from 1984 to 1985.\n\nHis father was fired by the Pirates during the 1985 season, and Peterson left the Pittsburgh system after that season as well. He joined the Cleveland Indians organization in 1986 and was a part of the coaching staff of Waterbury (AA) of the Eastern League in 1986, Buffalo (AAA) of the American Association in 1987 and Colorado Springs Sky Sox (AAA) of the Pacific Coast League in 1988.\n\nAfter departing the Cleveland organization, Peterson joined the Chicago White Sox farm system and spent six seasons there as a pitching coach. Peterson was with Birmingham Barons (AA) of the Southern League in 1989–91, Vancouver (AAA) of the American Association in 1992, and Nashville (AAA) of the Pacific Coast League in 1993–94. After spending many years in the minor leagues, Peterson was promoted to the White Sox on June 21, 1994.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1995, Peterson stayed with the White Sox as a Co-director of the sports psychology program as it related to performance behavior.\n\nIn 1996, Peterson became the Toronto Blue Jays minor league pitching coordinator. The following season, he was the pitching coach of the Trenton Thunder, then the AA affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nPeterson joined the Oakland Athletics organization as a roving minor league pitching instructor for the 1998 season. He was named the major league pitching coach for the A's on March 26, 1998. He is well known for helping the A's develop the ‘Big Three’ of Barry Zito, Mark Mulder, and Tim Hudson. All three pitchers became 20-game winners under Rick Peterson and Zito won the 2002 American League Cy Young Award. After he arrived in 1998, Peterson helped his pitching staff obtain an American League best ERA for two years, 3.58 in 2002 and 3.63 in 2003.\n\nPeterson joined the New York Mets in November 2003 as their pitching coach, replacing Rick Waits. In July 2004, Peterson allegedly said he could \"fix\" Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Víctor Zambrano in \"10 minutes\" and that Mets’ top prospect and former first-round draft pick Scott Kazmir was at least 3 years away from being a Major League pitcher. The Mets shortly traded Kazmir for Zambrano, which was poorly received by many Mets fans, and the negative response grew when Zambrano had dismal results with the Mets after the trade, while Kazmir was immediately promoted to the majors by the Devil Rays and had strong early success. Many believed that Peterson's statements indicated that he was a prime mover in making the trade. Others claim that Peterson was merely giving his opinion as pitching coach, and that any responsibility for the trade should fall on GM Jim Duquette, owner Fred Wilpon, COO Jeff Wilpon, or scouting directors Al Goldis and Bill Livesey. Early in the 2006 season, Zambrano suffered a season-ending injury to his elbow, and he was not re-signed after the season; he is no longer in baseball. Kazmir, in contrast, became a three-time All-Star (2006, 2008, 2014) and led the American League in strikeouts in 2007.\n\nSome Mets fans have also pointed out that Heath Bell floundered during Peterson's tenure as the Mets pitching coach yet thrived immediately after leaving the Mets, even becoming an All-Star with the San Diego Padres in 2009. \"Everything in New York was so serious\", Bell said. \"I should keep my mouth shut, but I never do. In 2005, I didn't pitch for 28 straight days. I don't know if I did something to Willie [Randolph, then the manager of the Mets]. I didn't always get along with [then pitching coach] Rick Peterson.\". Baseball Prospectus listed Bell as one of its \"Five players to watch in 2005\"—along with Justin Morneau, D'Angelo Jiménez, Dan Haren, and Josh Beckett. After a poor 2005 season, however, Bell's game appearances declined from 42 in 2005 to 22 in 2006 before he was traded.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, Peterson's contract with the Mets was extended through the 2009 season.\n\nOn June 17, 2008, Rick Peterson, along with Manager Willie Randolph and first base coach Tom Nieto, was fired from his position with the New York Mets.\n\nOn October 19, 2009, Peterson agreed to become the Milwaukee Brewers new pitching coach. However, when new manager Ron Roenicke's staff was announced on November 15, 2010, it was revealed that Peterson had been replaced by Rick Kranitz with a year remaining on his contract.\n\nIn January 2012, Peterson was hired as the Director of Pitching Development for the Baltimore Orioles, a position he held through the 2016 season.\n\nIn January 2009, Peterson along with Jim Duquette and other business partners launched 3P Sports. 3P Sports combined Peterson's coaching philosophies for conditioning, pitching drills and sports psychology with biomechanical analysis data using the work done by Dr. James Andrew's American Sports Medicine Institute ASMI as the benchmark. The 3P Program claims to help pitchers of all ages achieve peak pitching performance while remaining healthy. 3P sells directly via its web site www.3PSports.com, or through a series of Channel Partners located throughout North America. Delivered over the web as a membership program with 24 × 7 availability, 3P pitchers get monthly updates designed for peak performance results.\n\n"}

Food safety agencies, such as the United States' Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSiIS), define the danger zone as roughly . The FSIS stipulates that potentially hazardous food should not be stored at temperatures in this range in order to prevent foodborne illness (for example, a refrigerator's temperature must be kept below ), and that food that remains in this zone for more than two hours should not be consumed. Foodborne microorganisms grow much faster in the middle of the zone, at temperatures between .\n\nFood-borne bacteria, in large enough numbers, may cause food poisoning, symptoms similar to gastroenteritis or \"stomach flu\" (a misnomer, as true influenza primarily affects the respiratory system). Some of the symptoms include stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Food-borne illness becomes more dangerous in certain populations, such as people with weakened immune systems, young children, the elderly, and pregnant women. In Canada, there are approximately 4 million cases of food-borne disease per year. These symptoms can begin as early as shortly after and as late as weeks after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nTime and temperature control plays a critical role in food safety. To prevent time-temperature abuse, the amount of time food spends in the danger zone must be minimized. A logarithmic relationship exists between microbial cell death and temperature, that is, a small decrease of cooking temperature can result in considerable numbers of cells surviving the process. In addition to reducing the time spent in the danger zone, foods should be moved through the danger zone as few times as possible when reheating or cooling.\n\nFoods that are potentially hazardous inside the danger zone:\n\nAccording to Bryan (2004), a more complex, but more comprehensive picture of food safety hazards can be given by full consideration of the many factors involved. He advocates seeing the danger zone as \"a series of ranges that represent different degrees of hazards and risks.\" He presents the danger zone in a chart of time versus temperature as having a zone of high danger in which foods are at temperatures between 30C and 45C for several hours, surrounded by two zones of lesser danger involving exposure at lower temperatures for longer periods of time.\n\n"}

Removing the need for hospitalization, the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packets of this paste can be administered at home and allow larger numbers to be treated.\n\nPlumpy'Nut may be referred to in scientific literature as a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) alongside other RUTFs such as BP100.\n\nNutriset has been criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières for enforcing its Plumpy'nut patents.\n\nPlumpy’Nut is used as a treatment for emergency malnutrition cases. It supports rapid weight gain derived from broad nutrient intake which can alleviate a starving child from impending illness or death. The product is easy for children to eat because it dispenses readily from a durable, tear-open package. The fortified peanut butter-like paste contains fats, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, proteins (as essential macronutrients), vitamins and minerals (as essential micronutrients). Peanut butter itself is a rich source of vitamin E (45% of the Daily Value, DV, in a 100 gram amount) and B vitamins (particularly niacin at 67% DV).\n\nPlumpy'Nut has a two-year shelf-life and requires no water, preparation, or refrigeration. Its ease of use has made mass treatment of malnutrition in famine situations more efficient than in the past. Severe acute malnutrition has traditionally been treated with therapeutic milk and required hospitalization. Unlike milk, Plumpy'Nut can be administered at home and without medical supervision. It also provides calories and essential nutrients that restore and maintain body weight and health in severely malnourished children more effectively than F100.\n\nThe United Nations has recognized this utility, stating in 2007 that \"new evidence suggests... that large numbers of children with severe acute malnutrition can be treated in their communities without being admitted to a health facility or a therapeutic feeding centre,\" as was implemented in 2007 by UNICEF and the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Department in Niger to address a malnutrition emergency. Plumpy'nut conforms to the UN definition of a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF).\n\nPlumpy'nut is not intended for routine nutrition, or for malnutrition in non-famine situations. Peanut allergies have not been found to be a problem in usage due to a lack of allergic reactions in the target populations.\n\nThe ingredients in Plumpy'Nut include \"peanut-based paste, with sugar, vegetable oil and skimmed milk powder, enriched with vitamins and minerals\". Plumpy'Nut is said to be \"surprisingly tasty\".\n\nWhile the majority of Plumpy'Nut was made in France as of 2010, this therapeutic food is easily produced and can be made locally in peanut-growing areas by mixing peanut paste with a slurry of other ingredients provisioned by Nutriset.\n\nA number of partner companies and one non-profit organization in the U.S state of Rhode Island make Plumpy'Nut; six of the factories are in African countries (Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Sudan, Madagascar, Kenya), one is in Haiti and another one in India.\n\nPlumpy'Nut is distributed from the manufacturer to geographic areas of need through a complex supply chain. Forward information flows, such as projections of need, order processes, and payment information, and\nbackward information flows, including stock monitoring, quality assurance, and performance data\noccur through information exchange vulnerable to errors or tardiness associated with supply chain fragmentation.\nFactors affecting potential for loss of efficiencies in the supply chain are information flow on orders, basis of need, forecasts, flow upstream from field officers and country offices to parties controlling regional distribution and manufacturing by Nutriset, downstream flow of information on delivery times and order status.\n\nA complete two-month regimen for a child costs US$60 c. 2010.\n\nInspired by the popular Nutella spread, Plumpy'Nut was invented in 1996 by André Briend, a French paediatric nutritionist, and Michel Lescanne, a food-processing engineer. Nutella is a spread composed of sugar, modified palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skimmed milk powder, whey powder, lecithin, and vanillin. In contrast, Plumpy'Nut is a combination of peanut paste, vegetable oil and milk powder, without including chocolate, but containing sugar, vitamins and dietary minerals.\n\nSkippy may have developed a similar product in the early 1960s, according to a former employee, although it was never released.\n\nNutriset holds or held patents in many countries (including , published in 2002) for the production of nut-based, nutritional foods as pastes, which they have defended to prevent non-licensees in the United States from producing similar products. In places where Nutriset does not hold a patent, manufacturers of similar pastes have been stopped from exporting their products to places where Plumpy'Nut is patented. In at least 27 African nations, any non-profit (including NGOs) can make the paste and not pay a license fee.\n\nIn 2010, two US non-profit organizations unsuccessfully sued the French company in an attempt to legally produce Plumpy'Nut in the US without paying the royalty fee. Mike Mellace, president of one of the organizations claimed that “some children are dying because Nutriset prevents other companies from producing a food which could save their lives.” Invalidation of the Nutriset patent may have a positive impact on populations affected by famine, and studies by humanitarian organizations support the idea that having a single, dominant supplier in Nutriset is undesirable. Critics of Nutriset argue the US patent is “obvious in light of prior recipes” and “that the patent has essentially conferred monopoly power on Nutriset and thus violated the Sherman Act\". By definition, a patent grants a temporary monopoly, and Nutriset won the case. Some have suggested a similarity between pharmaceutical company compulsory licensing agreements, in place under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, and Plumpy'Nut.\n\nFollowing a threat of legal action against a Norwegian company that was exporting a similar product to Kenya, Nutriset was criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières, which stated in an open letter that \"Nutriset has been asked repeatedly by us and others for simple, reasonable licensing terms... Instead it appears that [Nutriset has] decided to adopt a policy of aggressive protection of [its] patents that could be considered an abuse in relation to humanitarian products.\" A UNICEF study, commissioned at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, recommended a diversified supplier base of RUTF products to better serve global needs. In response to the criticism, Nutriset has allowed companies and NGOs in some African countries to make the paste and not pay license fees.\n\nThe Plumpy'Nut patents in the USA expired in 2017 (), and in the UK and the European Union in 2018 ().\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040318", "title": "Myosatellite cell", "text": "Myosatellite cell\n\nMyosatellite cells, also known as satellite cells or muscle stem cells, are small multipotent cells with very little cytoplasm found in mature muscle. Satellite cells are precursors to skeletal muscle cells, able to give rise to satellite cells or differentiated skeletal muscle cells. They have the potential to provide additional myonuclei to their parent muscle fiber, or return to a quiescent state. More specifically, upon activation, satellite cells can re-enter the cell cycle to proliferate and differentiate into myoblasts.\n\nMyosatellite cells are located between the basement membrane and the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, and can lie in grooves either parallel or transversely to the longitudinal axis of the fibre. Their distribution across the fibre can vary significantly. Non-proliferative, quiescent myosatellite cells, which adjoin resting skeletal muscles, can be identified by their distinct location between sarcolemma and basal lamina, a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio, few organelles (e.g. ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, golgi complexes), small nuclear size, and a large quantity of nuclear heterochromatin relative to myonuclei. On the other hand, activated satellite cells have an increased number of caveolae, cytoplasmic organelles, and decreased levels of heterochromatin. Satellite cells are able to differentiate and fuse to augment existing muscle fibers and to form new fibers. These cells represent the oldest known adult stem cell niche, and are involved in the normal growth of muscle, as well as regeneration following injury or disease.\n\nIn undamaged muscle, the majority of satellite cells are \"quiescent\"; they neither differentiate nor undergo cell division. In response to mechanical strain, satellite cells become \"activated\". Activated satellite cells initially proliferate as skeletal myoblasts before undergoing myogenic differentiation.\n\nSatellite cells express a number of distinctive genetic markers. Current thinking is that most satellite cells express PAX7 and PAX3. Satellite cells in the head musculature have a unique developmental program, and are Pax3-negative. Moreover, both quiescent and activated human satellite cells can be identified by the membrane-bound neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM/CD56/Leu-19), a cell-surface glycoprotein. Myocyte nuclear factor (MNF), and c-met proto-oncogene (receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) are less commonly used markers.\n\nCD34 and Myf5 markers specifically define the majority of quiescent satellite cells. Activated satellite cells prove problematic to identify, especially as their markers change with the degree of activation; for example, greater activation results in the progressive loss of Pax7 expression as they enter the proliferative stage. However, Pax7 is expressed prominently after satellite cell differentiation. Greater activation also results in increased expression of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4 – all responsible for the induction of myocyte-specific genes. HGF testing is also used to identify active satellite cells. Activated satellite cells also begin expressing muscle-specific filament proteins such as desmin as they differentiate.\n\nThe field of satellite cell biology suffers from the same technical difficulties as other stem cell fields. Studies rely almost exclusively on Flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, which gives no information about cell lineage or behaviour. As such, the satellite cell niche is relatively ill-defined and it is likely that it consists of multiple sub-populations.\n\nWhen muscle cells undergo injury, quiescent satellite cells are released from beneath the basement membrane. They become activated and re-enter the cell cycle. These dividing cells are known as the \"transit amplifying pool\" before undergoing myogenic differentiation to form new (post-mitotic) myotubes. There is also evidence suggesting that these cells are capable of fusing with existing myofibers to facilitate growth and repair.\n\nThe process of muscle regeneration involves considerable remodeling of extracellular matrix and, where extensive damage occurs, is incomplete. Fibroblasts within the muscle deposit scar tissue, which can impair muscle function, and is a significant part of the pathology of muscular dystrophies.\n\nSatellite cells proliferate following muscle trauma and form new myofibers through a process similar to fetal muscle development. After several cell divisions, the satellite cells begin to fuse with the damaged myotubes and undergo further differentiations and maturation, with peripheral nuclei as in hallmark. One of the first roles described for IGF-1 was its involvement in the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. In addition, IGF-1 expression in skeletal muscle extends the capacity to activate satellite cell proliferation (Charkravarthy, et al., 2000), increasing and prolonging the beneficial effects to the aging muscle. \n\nSatellite cell activation is measured by the extent of proliferation and differentiation. Typically, satellite cell content is expressed per muscle fiber or as a percentage of total nuclear content, the sum of satellite cell nuclei and myonuclei. While the adaptive response to exercise largely varies on an individual basis on factors such as genetics, age, diet, acclimatization to exercise, and exercise volume, human studies have demonstrated general trends.\n\nIt is suggested that exercise triggers the release of signaling molecules including inflammatory substances, cytokines and growth factors from surrounding connective tissues and active skeletal muscles. Notably, HGF, a cytokine, is transferred from the extracellular matrix into muscles through the nitric-oxide dependent pathway. It is thought that HGF activates satellite cells, while insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) enhance satellite cell proliferation rate following activation. Studies have demonstrated that intense exercise generally increases IGF-1 production, though individual responses vary significantly. More specifically, IGF-1 exists in two isoforms: mechano growth factor (MGF) and IGF-IEa. While the former induces activation and proliferation, the latter causes differentiation of proliferating satellite cells.\n\nHuman studies have shown that both high resistance training and endurance training have yielded an increased number of satellite cells. These results suggest that a light, endurance training regimen may be useful to counteract the age-correlated satellite cell decrease. In high-resistance training, activation and proliferation of satellite cells are evidenced by increased cyclin D1 mRNA, and p21 mRNA levels. This is consistent with the fact that cyclin D1 and p21 upregulation correlates to division and differentiation of cells.\n\nSatellite cell activation has also been demonstrated on an ultrastructural level following exercise. Aerobic exercise has been shown to significantly increase granular endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, and mitochondria of the stimulated muscle groups. Additionally, satellite cells have been shown to fuse with muscle fibers, developing new muscle fibers. Other ultrastructural evidence for activated satellite cells include increased concentration of Golgi apparatus and pinocytotic vesicles.\n\nUpon minimal stimulation, satellite cells \"in vitro\" or \"in vivo\" will undergo a myogenic differentiation program.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that transplanted satellite cells have a limited capacity for migration, and are only able to regenerate muscle in the region of the delivery site. As such, systemic treatments or even the treatment of an entire muscle in this way is not possible. However, other cells in the body such as pericytes and hematopoietic stem cells have all been shown to be able to contribute to muscle repair in a similar manner to the endogenous satellite cell. The advantage of using these cell types for therapy in muscle diseases is that they can be systemically delivered, autonomously migrating to the site of injury. Particularly successful recently has been the delivery of mesoangioblast cells into the Golden Retriever dog model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which effectively cured the disease. However, the sample size used was relatively small and the study has since been criticized for a lack of appropriate controls for the use of immunosuppressive drugs.\nRecently, it has been reported that Pax7 expressing cells contribute to dermal wound repair by adopting a fibrotic phenotype through a Wnt/β-catenin mediated process.\n\nLittle is known of the regulation of satellite cells. Whilst together PAX3 and PAX7 currently form the definitive satellite markers, Pax genes are notoriously poor transcriptional activators. The dynamics of activation and quiesence and the induction of the myogenic program through the \"myogenic regulatory factors\", Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4 remains to be determined.\n\nThere is some research indicating that satellite cells are negatively regulated by a protein called myostatin. Increased levels of myostatin up-regulate a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor called p21 and thereby inhibit the differentiation of satellite cells.\n\n\n"}

His work reflects the influence of socialist realism, and owes a debt to Surrealists Giorgio de Chirico and René Magritte, although Rauch hesitates to align himself with surrealism. He studied at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig, and he lives in Markkleeberg near Leipzig, Germany and works as the principal artist of the New Leipzig School. The artist is represented by Galerie EIGEN + ART Leipzig/Berlin and David Zwirner, New York.\n\nRauch's paintings suggest a narrative intent but, as art historian Charlotte Mullins explains, closer scrutiny immediately presents the viewer with enigmas: \"Architectural elements peter out; men in uniform from throughout history intimidate men and women from other centuries; great struggles occur but their reason is never apparent; styles change at a whim.\"\n\nRauch's parents died in a train accident when he was four weeks old. His father Hanno Rauch was 21, his mother Helga Wand 19 years old - at the time both of them studied art at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig (Leipzig Academy of Visual Arts). Neo Rauch grew up with his grandparents in Aschersleben and passed his \"Abitur\" exam at the Thomas-Müntzer-Oberschule (now Gymnasium Stephaneum). He studied painting at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig and then was Masterstudent with Professor Arno Rink (1981–1986) and with Professor Bernhard Heisig (1986–1990). After the fall of the GDR Rauch worked from 1993 to 1998 as an assistant to Arno Rink and Sighard Gille at the Leipziger Akademie.\n\nIn 2004, he was a selector for EASTinternational with Gerd Harry Lybke.\n\nFrom August 2005 until February 2009, he was Professor at the Leipziger Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst. Together with Timm Rautert he was curator for the exhibit \"Man muss sich beeilen, wenn man noch etwas sehen will...\" (\"One has to hurry, if one still wants to see something...\") at Gut Selikum in Neuss.\n\nRauch works with his spouse and artist Rosa Loy at a former cotton-mill, Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei, about which he says: \"It is the location of concentration and inspiration. Here the best ideas come to me.\" With an estimated fortune of €100 million, he was ranked one of the richest 1,001 individuals and families in Germany by the monthly business publication \"Manager Magazin\" in 2017.\n\nRauch is the subject of the 2016 film \"Neo Rauch – Gefährten und Begleiter\", directed by Nicola Graef.\n\nIn 1991 Neo Rauch had his first solo exhibition in the Leipzig Galerie am Thomaskirchhof. In 1993, the Deputy Director of the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Rolf Lauter, discovered the artist‘s work and, thanks to the support of the Jürgen Ponto-Stiftung, realized a first non-commercial presentation of his then latest works in the exhibition rooms of Dresdner Bank Frankfurt. In the catalog text, Lauter referred to Rauch‘s combinatorial principle of sampling, incorporating elements from art history, paraphrases of surrealism and metaphors of the banal everyday world. Rauch won the Vincent Award in 2002, which received a corresponding solo show at the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, The Netherlands, that same year. In 2010, Rauch had his first museum retrospective, which was jointly held at the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig, Germany, and the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, Germany. In 2011, a selection of the works from this retrospective then traveled to the Zachęta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw, Poland. In 2007, the Galerie Rudolfinum in Prague held a retrospective entitled \"Neue Rollen,\" organized by the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, of Rauch's works covering 13 years. \n\nOther solo exhibitions include the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, Montreal, Canada (2006); Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany (2006); Centro de Arte Contemporáneo Málaga, Málaga, Spain (2005); and the Albertina, Vienna, Austria (2004). His work was featured at the 2005 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and he had his first solo North American museum exhibition at the Saint Louis Art Museum in St. Louis, Missouri in 2003-2004. In 2013, he got his first Belgian solo exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels (Belgium), called \"Neo Rauch. The Obsession of the Demiurge. Selected Works 1993-2012\".\n\nIn painting \"Characteristic, suggestion and eternity\" are important marks of quality.\n\nRauch is considered to be part of the New Leipzig School and his works are characterized by a style that depends on the Social Realism of communism. Especially American critics prefer to recognize in his contemporary style a post communist Surrealism. But more than anyone Rauch is recognized as an East-West painter. Rauch merges the modern myths of both the Warsaw Pact and the Western world. His figures are portrayed in a landscape in which an American Comic-Aestheticism meets the Social Realism of communism. In the art publication \"Texte zur Kunst\" (Texts about Art, number 55), he was defined as an example for a new German neo-conservatism.\n\nIn the US, Roberta Smith, art critic for the \"New York Times\", called attention to Rauch's work in 2002 with an article about the \"painter who came in from the cold.\" In 2007, Rauch painted a series of works especially for a solo exhibition in the mezzanine of the modern art wing at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. This special exhibition was called \"Para.\" Rauch explains that he enjoys the associations the word \"para\" evokes in his own mind, and says that his works at \"Para\" have no particular intention, but that they could signify anything to anyone.\n\nWorks for \"Para\":\n\nThe works created for \"Para\" are characterized by three elements: a pre-communist civic-mindedness, communist Social Realism, and an idealized countryside. On the other hand, it's a prefix which evokes associations like \"para-normal\", \"para-dox\" or \"para-noia\". It may be read in a system connection, for example a picture like \"Paranoia\" reflects the cognitions theory in a hermetic room.\n\nLeipzig, Rauch's city of birth, is known historically as a city of trade through its association with the Leipzig Trade Fair. This civic-mindedness of a trader's city also expressed itself under communism where Leipzig was the center of popular resistance that led to Die Wende. Rauch uses characters and images of life of pre-communist civil society that was oppressed by communism in the GDR. The oppression of communism and the total control of civic life under the rule of communist ideology is one of the elements of Rauch's work. The destructive powers of ideologies is perhaps the reason why Rauch refuses to interpret his own work as a powerful statement in favor of a cultural relativism that characterized the civic bourgeois thought that was destroyed.\n\nWork by the artist is held in public collections, including the Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, The Netherlands; Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart, Berlin, Germany; Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum der Bildenden Künste Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, Germany; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.\n\n\n\n"}

It was set for a 1999 release, but due to problems with his record label, Raw Shack Records, J-Live left the label and the album was shelved. J-Live moved to Payday Records, but when Payday's parent company London Records was bought from Universal Music Group by WEA, the album was again shelved.

{"id": "2040341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040341", "title": "Martin Kippenberger", "text": "Martin Kippenberger\n\nMartin Kippenberger (25 February 1953 – 7 March 1997) was a German artist and sculptor known for his extremely prolific output in a wide range of styles and media, superfiction as well as his provocative, jocular and hard-drinking public persona.\n\nKippenberger was \"widely regarded as one of the most talented German artists of his generation,\" according to Roberta Smith of the \"New York Times\". He was at the center of a generation of German \"enfants terribles\" including Albert Oehlen, Markus Oehlen, Werner Büttner, Georg Herold, Dieter Göls, and Günther Förg.\n\nKippenberger was born in Dortmund in 1953, the only boy in a family with five children, with two elder and two younger sisters. His father was director of the Katharina-Elisabeth colliery, his mother a dermatologist. When Kippenberger's mother was killed by a pallet falling off a truck, he inherited enough money to live on. He studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where Sigmar Polke, despite not teaching him directly, influenced him. After a sojourn in Florence, where he had his first solo show in 1977, he settled in Berlin in 1978. In that year he founded Kippenberger's Office with Gisela Capitain, mounting exhibitions of his own art and that of his friends. During that same period, Kippenberger also became business director of SO36, a performance, film and music space, and started a punk band called the Grugas, which recorded a single called \"Luxus\" with Christine Hahn and Eric Mitchell. Leaving Berlin, originally for a long visit to Paris, Kippenberger spent the early 1980s as an active member of the Cologne art scene.\n\nIn Cologne, as elsewhere, Kippenberger did not limit himself to producing works of art; he worked on how the art was presented, the framework and the sideshows. \"Martin was tremendously committed to the gallery's artists,\" Max Hetzler said. The Vienna gallerist Peter Pakesch thinks Kippenberger did an enormous amount for the Hetzler Gallery's success in his double role \"as clown and strategist... Max without Martin's strategy would have been unimaginable in the early years.\" According to artist Jutta Koether, Kippenberger \"was the one who brought movement to life so that it became known outside Cologne.\"\n\nIn 1984, he became a founding member of the Lord Jim Lodge. After moving to Los Angeles in late 1989, he bought a 35% share in ownership of the Italian restaurant Capri in Venice, Los Angeles. He stayed in Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald as a guest of the Grässlin family of art collectors from 1980 to 1981, and later on and off from 1991 to 1994, in order to work but also to recover from his excessive life. In his last years he taught at the Städelschule and the Kassel Art Academy.\n\nMartin Kippenberger died at age 44 from liver cancer at the Vienna General Hospital.\n\nKippenberger’s refusal to adopt a specific style and medium in which to disseminate his images resulted in an extremely prolific and varied oeuvre which includes an amalgam of sculpture, paintings, works on paper, photographs, installations, prints and ephemera.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Kippenberger’s artwork underwent periods of strong political reflection. During a trip to Brazil in 1986, Kippenberger bought a gas station by the sea in Salvador de Bahia and renamed it the \"Martin Bormann Gas Station.\" With the fictionally acquired gas station, Kippenberger gave Martin Bormann a camouflage address and the possibility of an income in exile; Kippenberger allegedly installed a telephone line and employees were obliged to answer calls with ‘Tankstelle Martin Bormann’. Later accused of neo-Nazi attitudes by German critic Wolfgang Max Faust, he made several life-size, dressed mannequin sculptures of himself, called \"Martin, ab in die Ecke und schäm Dich (Martin, into the Corner, You Should Be Ashamed of Yourself)\" (1989), placed facing the wall.\n\nKippenberger also felt that he was working in the face of a 'perceived death of painting' and his art reflects his struggle with the concept that, at the turn of the millennium, it was impossible to produce anything original or authentic. \"Blass vor Neid steht er vor deiner Tür [Pale with Envy, He Stands Outside Your Door]\" (1981), for instance, comprises twenty-one individual canvases shown together as one work, but each canvas has a separate title and there is no consistent style. In 1987 he integrated a 1972, all-gray abstract painting by Gerhard Richter, which he himself had purchased, into the top of a coffee table. For the photorealist paintings from a series titled \"Lieber Maler, Male Mir\" or \"Dear Painter, Paint Me\", Kippenberger hired a commercial painter named Werner to make them and signed them Werner Kippenberger. \"Untitled [The installation of the White Paintings]\" make formal reference to debates around language-based conceptual art as a critique of the ‘empty’ white cube gallery space. In a first series of works alluding to Picasso that were to follow in 1988, Kippenberger took this project further, looking to the ultimate Modern icon as a contemporary foil. Restaging a well-known photograph by David Douglas Duncan of Picasso standing in a 'puffed-up' state of undress on the steps of Château Vauvenargues in 1962 Kippenberger was parodying his famous antecedent, playfully subverting the machismo associated with the genre of self-portraiture. First adopted as a motif in his 1988 series of self-portraits undertaken in Carmona, Spain, Kippenberger depicted himself with white briefs pulled up high over his exaggerated belly, as he turned to examine himself in a mirror.\n\nKippenberger made the first of \"Laterne (Lamp)\" sculptures in 1988, a year that he spent largely living in Seville and Madrid in Spain. This work, \"Laterne an Betrunkene ('Street Lamp for Drunks')\" has become well known through its exhibition at the 1988 Venice Biennale. The original motif of the lamp sculptures derived in part from the photographs that filled Kippenberger's 1988 artist's book, \"Psychobuildings\".\n\nIn 1989, Kippenberger and fellow artist Jeff Koons worked together on an issue of the art journal \"Parkett\"; the following year, Koons designed an exhibition poster for Kippenberger.\n\nIn 1990, while sojourning in New York City, Kippenberger started a body of work collectively known as the \"Latex\" or \"Rubber\" paintings. Also in the 1990s, influenced by the Lost Art Movement, Kippenberger had the idea of an underground network encircling the whole world. Located on the Greek island of Syros and in Dawson City, Canada, false subway entrances are part of the \"Metro-Net World Connection\" series (1993–7) Kippenberger built as private commissions; a sizable length of subway grating, complete with the sounds of trains and gusts of wind, was exhibited posthumously at the Venice Biennale.\n\nThe \"Happy End of Franz Kafka’s ‘Amerika’\" (1994) explores the fictional utopia of universal employment, adapting Kafka’s idea of communal job interviews into an artwork. The installation consists of a diverse assortment of objects and furniture, assembled to suggest a playing field for conducting mass interviews. There are over 40 tables and twice as many chairs, from classics of twentieth-century design, such as chairs by Arne Jacobsen and Charles Eames, to worn-out tables bought in flea markets, remnants of previous Kippenberger exhibitions, and even work by other artists.\n\nDuring the last 10 years of his life Kippenberger created a series of drawings on hotel stationery, which are commonly referred to as the 'hotel drawings' (1987–1997). Originally undertaken as ad hoc preparatory diagrams for the three-dimensional \"Peter\" sculptures, he later used the myriad letterheads of innumerable hotels to capture other subjects and inspirations. Collected in his travels, Kippenberger conceived them in thematic series (portraits of scientists, portraits of Frank Sinatra, depictions of war etc.). His late collages incorporate photographs (Polaroids, film stills, magazine clips), prints (one by Sigmar Polke), exhibition posters from past Kippenberger shows, some folded up origami-style, self-produced decals, and photographed and rephotographed drawings. Executed in 1996 as part of the series, \"Untitled\" offers a depiction of Kippenberger standing side by side with his daughter Helena as a little girl.\n\nIn the final two series, Kippenberger first can be seen posing like Picasso’s last wife, Jacqueline, subtitling the piece \"The Paintings Pablo Couldn’t Paint Anymore\". In the complex of lithographs entitled \"Medusa\" (1996), Kippenberger used photography as his starting point although, this time, he himself posed for wife and photographer Elfie Semotan, mimicking the postures of the characters in the famous painting \"The Raft of the Medusa\" (1819) by Théodore Géricault (1791-1824).\n\nIn 2011, Kippenberger's \"When It Starts Dripping From the Ceiling\" was accidentally destroyed by a janitor in a Dortmund museum who believed she was cleaning stains off of the work.\n\nIn 1985, Kippenberger exhibited \"Buying America and Selling El Salvador\" at Metro Pictures Ltd in New York, a large installation comprising numerous sculptural works. Although he had his first museum exhibition at Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt in 1986, he drew greater attention from institutions outside Germany, with exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1993) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1994).\n\nKippenberger's artistic reputation and influence has grown since his death. In 2003, he represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 2003 (with Candida Höfer. He has since been the subject of a several large retrospective exhibitions, including at the Tate Modern in 2006 and \"the Problem Perspective\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2008; the exhibition traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2009. In 2011, the Museo Picasso Malaga hosted 'Kippenberger Meets Picasso'. This exhibition showed how Kippenbeger was interested in Pablo Picasso, an artistic attraction resulted in works, and entire series, that were direct references to the Spanish artist.\n\nIn 2013 the newly founded Greek Organization for Culture and Development, NEON, presented the work of the German artist in the exhibition \"A Cry for Freedom\", curated by Dimitris Paleocrassas at the Museum of Cycladic Art, in Athens, Greece with works from the D.Daskalopoulos Collection and the Estate Martin Kippenberger, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne. The exhibition presented over 60 works including paintings, sculptures, hotel drawings and photographs, and is the first time that Kippenberger’s work will be displayed in a museum environment in Greece. \n\nThe Estate Martin Kippenberger is represented by Skarstedt Gallery, New York, in collaboration with Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne. \n\nKippenberger collected and commissioned work by many of his peers: some of his exhibition posters were designed by such prominent artists as Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Rosemarie Trockel and Mike Kelley.\n\nWhile Kippenberger's star has risen steadily since his death, his market has evolved in several distinct stages. His work was only considered auction-worthy toward the very end of his life, and even then, it rarely sold for more than $10,000. Only in spring 2005 at Phillips de Pury & Company, an untitled 1991 painting sold for $1,024,000. In 2011, Kippenberger's lamp sculpture \"Untitled\" (1990) was sold for £1,329,250 ($2,094,898) at Christie's London.\n\nKippenberger's self-portraits have in the past achieved the highest prices. In 2012, an untitled self-portrait sold for £3.2 million ($5.1 million) at a Christie's London Evening sale. In 2014, Kippenberger’s untitled 1988 self-portrait, restaging a photograph of the 81-year-old Picasso in his white underwear taken by David Douglas Duncan, fetched $18.6 million. Later that year, Larry Gagosian bought a 1988 self-portrait by Kippenberger, which shows the artist in his underwear, for $22.5 million at Christie's in New York.\n\nKippenberger's art garnered some recognition in the mid-nineties when three pieces were used by Welsh alternative rock music group Manic Street Preachers as the cover artwork on the three singles released from their third album, \"The Holy Bible\", in 1994: part four of the five-part \"Fliegender Tanga\" (\"Flying Tanga\"), which would be sold for £2,561,250 in 2010, was used for the first single \"Faster/P.C.P.\"; a 1983 piece, \"Sympatische Kommunistin\" (\"Nice Communist Woman\"), appeared on part one of the two-part single \"Revol\"; and, \"Titten, Türme, Tortellini\" (\"Tits, Towers, Tortellini\"), credited under its French title \" Des tètons(sic), des tours, des tortellini\", was the cover artwork on both parts of the two-part, third single \"She Is Suffering\".\n\nIn 2008, during an exhibition at the Museion in Bozen, Italy, a sculpture by Kippenberger depicting a toad being crucified called \"Zuerst die Füsse\" (\"First the Feet\") was condemned by Pope Benedict as blasphemous.\n\n\n"}

Gallatin was a U.S. Congressman, the longest-serving Secretary of the Treasury under two presidents, and ambassador to France and Great Britain. The house overlooks the Monongahela River near Point Marion, Pennsylvania, about south of Pittsburgh.\n\nIt is maintained by the National Park Service as Friendship Hill National Historic Site and is open to the public.\n\nFriendship Hill is a parcel of land in size, located on the east bank of the Monongahela River between New Geneva and Point Marion in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. The property's main house, also known as the Albert Gallatin House, is located atop a bluff that is the high point of the property.\n\nThe house is made up of seven sections. The earliest of these is the original brick house built in 1789. This structure was constructed in the Federal style with a Flemish bond. Along the north side of the brick house, a simple frame dwelling was added in 1798. The Stone House was the next structure added by Gallatin in 1823; this is a three-and-a-half story structure, the largest section of the total house. This was the only structure which Gallatin did not build and oversee himself. This portion was built and overseen by one of his sons, Albert Rolaz Gallatin. A stone kitchen was added in 1824, which was the last addition of the Gallatin era.\n\nThe rest of the additions include a State Dining Room in 1895, a south bedroom wing completed in 1902, and the servants' quarters added in 1903. These portions were built by the later owners of the house.\n\nAlbert Gallatin, a native of Geneva, Switzerland, came to the United States in 1780. He became involved in real estate speculation in western Pennsylvania and Virginia not long afterward, and purchased the land and house that became Friendship Hill in 1788. He sold the property in 1832, settling in New York City. His long period of public service included serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and as United States Ambassador to France.\n\nThe house was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places when the register was established on October 15, 1966, at which time the house was privately owned. The national historic site was established on November 10, 1978, and is administered under Fort Necessity National Battlefield.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his work with Charles Mingus, Gil Evans, Roy Haynes and in the quartet he co-led with pianist Don Pullen, featuring bassist Cameron Brown and drummer Dannie Richmond. He was also known for his idiosyncratic singing.\n\nGeorge Adams was born in Covington, Georgia on April 29, 1940. He first started playing piano at the age of eleven and switched to tenor saxophone in high school. Later on, he went study at the Clark College and got lessons on flute by Wayman Carver. As a teenager, George Adams frequently gained performance experience by playing with local funk bands. In 1961, he accompanied singer Sam Cooke on a tour. At this point, Adams was based out of Cleveland where he spent a great deal of time studying and working with organ trios alongside pianist and organist Bill Doggett. The two men played a form of music that combined rhythm and blues with jazz. In 1968, he decided to expand his career and move to New York City to participate in the city's growing jazz scene. A year later, George Adams toured with Roy Haynes, playing with him until 1973. Shortly after, he performed with Art Blakey before joining Charles Mingus' band. His partnership with Mingus would last until 1976.\n\nGeorge Adams' first appearance with Mingus was on \"Mingus Moves\" with Ronald Hampton, Dannie Richmond, and Don Pullen in 1973. Later on, Adams went to perform in \"Mingus at Carnegie Hall, Changes One\" and \"Changes Two.\" He also appeared in Mingus' \"Whee\" (1973) and other albums. 1975, while touring Europe with Mingus, he made his first recordings under his own name with Don Pullen, Dannie Richmond and bassist David Williams. Adams also began a working relationship with Gil Evans that lasted until 1978 that same year.\n\nAdams' first appearance with Evans was on his album \"The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix\", which was dedicated to the compositional efforts of rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. The album features orchestral versions of songs such as Angel, Castles Made of Sand and Voodoo Child. George Adams continued to record with Gil Evans throughout 1975 by contributing to his album \"There Comes a Time.\"\n\nIn 1976, Adams began to performing on and off with pianist McCoy Tyner until the late 1980s. The following year, George performed with trumpeter Marvin Hannibal Peterson at the Antibes Jazz Festival in Antibes, France. He appeared on Tyner's album \"The Greeting\" in 1978 alongside bassist Charles Fambrough and drummer Sonship.\n\nIn 1979, Adams and Pullen began to co-lead a quartet with Dannie Richmond and bassist Cameron Brown. In December 1979, George recorded the album \"Paradise Space Shuttle\" with his personal quintet that featured pianist Ron Burton, drummer Al Foster, bassist Don Pate and percussionist Azzedin Weston.\n\nAdams' contributions to his ensemble were best heard on \"Paradise Space Shuttle\"'s title track. After a brief introduction, he enters the arrangement playing a disjointed and primal melody. He then plays a more traditional bebop figure before supplementing it with a strident motif. He continues to utilize several different textures throughout the song, such as multiphonics, blues riffs and phrased melodic devices. The result of all this is a performance that includes a multitude of saxophone history into four and a half minutes.\n\nIn 1980, Adams and Dannie Richmond recorded the album \"Hand to Hand\" for the Soul Note label. The album featured trombonist Jimmy Knepper, pianist Hugh Lawson and bassist Mike Richmond. In August 1980, Adams and Pullen recorded the album \"Earth Beams.\" The ensemble demonstrated its best on the album's title track. Adams' immediate performance provides a great deal of melodic presence throughout the song. George's deep resonance helps to thicken the harmonic quality of the song. The fundamentals of the ensemble are also anchored perfectly by Dannie Richmond.\n\nIn 1983, Adams started to expand on his career as a sideman by recording with trombonist Craig Harris on his album \"Black Bone.\" The following year, George recorded as a member of the Mingus Dynasty at the Village Vanguard. In April 1985, Adams and Pullen recorded the album \"Live at Montmatre\", but wasn't released until 2000, and featured a guest appearance by guitarist John Scofield. The group is quite noteworthy on the song Well, I Guess We'll Never Know.\n\nAfter a brief introduction from Richmond, the ensemble goes into a variation of Rhythm Changes with a different take on the bridge. The unison line of Adams and Scofield gives the overall melodic stance of the song more body and power. During his solo, Adams shadows Pullen's \"sheets of sound\" solo by performing with the same bravado and style. The addition of Scofield adds more of a foundation for George to work off of with the outcome being an even more confident melodic statement.\n\nThe following year, Adams and Hannibal Peterson recorded the album \"More Sightings\" for the Enja label. In 1987, George recorded the album \"Where Were You?\" with the group Orange Then Blue. It featured trumpeter Ken Cervenka, trombonist Peter Cirelli and French horn player Gunther Schuller, amongst others. He then became a member of the band Phalanx that same year alongside drummer Rashied Ali, bassist Sirone and guitarist James Blood Ulmer and released the album \"Original Phalanx.\"\n\nIn 1988, Richmond died and the Adams/Pullen group briefly replaced him with drummer Lewis Nash, then disbanded. Adams then formed a new quartet with Cameron Brown, Hugh Lawson and drummer Gregory Hutchinson. The same year, George recorded an album of ballads and spirituals entitled \"Nightingale\" alongside Lawson, Sirone and drummer Victor Lewis. The album features renditions of \"What a Wonderful World\", \"Moon River\", and \"Ol Man River.\" 1988 also saw the release of the Phalanx album \"In Touch.\"\n\nAdams and Don Pullen shared a musical vision and their quartet straddled the range from R&B to the avant-garde. (The quartet was sometimes known as the \"George Adams–Don Pullen Quartet\", and sometimes as the \"Don Pullen–George Adams Quartet\".) After Adams' death, Pullen dedicated to his memory the 1993 CD \"Ode To Life\", recorded by his African-Brazilian Connection, and in particular the ballad \"Ah George, We Hardly Knew Ya\".\n\nOne of Adams' last recordings was \"America\" on the Blue Note label. This album consists of classic American songs like \"Tennessee Waltz\", \"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" as well as a few original songs that articulate Adams' positive view of his country and the gifts it had given him. It also includes \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"America the Beautiful\".\n\nAdams was a member of the band that played \"Epitaph\" by Charles Mingus.\n\n\n\nWith Phalanx\n\nWith Gil Evans\n\nWith Craig Harris\nWith Roy Haynes\nWith Cecil McBee\nWith Charles Mingus\n\nWith New York Unit\n\nWith Don Pullen\n\nWith James Blood Ulmer\n\nWith McCoy Tyner\n"}
{"id": "2040353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040353", "title": "Motörhead (album)", "text": "Motörhead (album)\n\nMotörhead is the self-titled debut studio album by the band Motörhead, released on 21 August 1977, on Chiswick Records, one of the first for the label. It is officially regarded as the band's debut album, though an album was recorded in 1975 for United Artists which was shelved, and was only released in 1979 after the band had established themselves commercially. This would be the first album to feature what would become the \"classic\" Motörhead lineup of Lemmy Kilmister, \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and Philthy Animal Taylor and their only release under Chiswick, as they were signed to the larger Bronze Records by early 1978.\n\nMotörhead hired lead guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke in early 1977, and he was originally to serve as the band's second guitarist along with Larry Wallis in what was intended to be a four-piece lineup, but Wallis left shortly after for his own reasons. Sensing that the fledgling band had dim prospects for success, Motörhead decided to disband after playing one final show at the Marquee Club in London that year. Ted Carroll, founder of the upstart Chiswick Records label, knew Lemmy well from his rare 45 Record's store in London of which Lemmy was a frequent customer. Carroll decided to give the band a break and hosted what was to be their final performance at the Marquee. The decision was made to record the gig. As Clarke recalls in the documentary \"The Guts and the Glory\":\nFeeling that the band had already seen its share of adversity, Carroll offered the band two days of studio time at Escape Studios in Kent, England, to record a single with producer John \"Speedy\" Keen. As Clarke explained to John Robinson of \"Uncut\" in 2015, the band finished the gig at the Marquee and drove straight to the studio in Kent for a weekend of recording:\n\nAs biographer Joel McIver recalls in his book \"Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead\":\nDue to the very limited studio time afforded the band, the decision was made to re-record the unreleased United Artists album almost in its entirety; only \"Fools\" and \"Leaving Here\" weren't re-recorded at the Kent sessions. In addition, two new self-penned compositions, \"White Line Fever\" and \"Keep Us on the Road\", were added, as well as a cover of John Mayall's \"Train Kept A-Rollin\". Three tracks on the album were actually composed by Lemmy while he was still a member of Hawkwind, \"Motorhead\", \"Lost Johnny\", and \"The Watcher\", the latter a psychedelic acoustic piece. Like the band name itself, the song \"Motorhead\" () is a reference to speed – Lemmy's drug of choice at that time- and was coupled with the non-album track \"City Kids\" (a Larry Wallis composition from his Pink Fairies' days) for release as 7\" and 12\" singles. In his autobiography \"White Line Fever\", Lemmy recalls working with producer Speedy Keen and engineer John Burns and the challenges arising from a lack of time:\nThe band members were less than pleased with the finished product, and guitarist Clarke has referred to the album's muddled sound as \"pretty dreadful\". Four remaining tracks from the session were shelved until 1980, when they were released as the \"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\" EP. In his memoir Lemmy noted:\n\nThe B-side and the EP tracks were later added as bonus material on the CD release.\n\nThe sleeve artwork featured the debut of War-Pig, the fanged face that would become an icon of the band and would appear on most of the band's album covers. War-Pig was created by artist Joe Petagno, who had earlier worked with Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and had designed the Swan Song Records logo for Led Zeppelin. According to its creator, War-Pig represents a combination of a bear, a wolf and a dog skull with boar tusks. The original \"Motörhead\" album cover contained a swastika on the spike of the helmet, though it was removed from future copies of the album.\n\nThe inner sleeve featured old and new photographs of the band and friends by long time friend Motorcycle Irene, who took most of the 70's pictures of Motörhead, plus letters of thanks from Lemmy, Eddie and Phil. Advertisements for the album, single, and tour bore the words \"Achtung! This Band Takes No Prisoners\".\n\nAlex Ogg of AllMusic wrote: \"Though only a minor chart success, Motörhead patented the group's style: Lemmy's rasping vocal over a speeding juggernaut of guitar, bass, and drums...no wonder the punks liked them.\" Many critics have noted that the album is not as polished as later works like \"Bomber\" and \"Ace of Spades\". Assessing the album and its debut single in 2011, biographer Joel McIver states: \"with the benefit of hindsight it's glaringly obvious that neither comes close to capturing the group's mesmerizing live sound.\" Kris Needs of Loudersound praises the album, saying \"Although the roller-coaster sound can be uneven and The Watcher still embedded in west London space-rock, Motörhead still sounds like the kamikaze rampage of desperate men granted one last shot, surging through speed-driven carnage to snatch triumph from oblivion.\"\n\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\n\n\n"}

The camp is affiliated with Habonim Dror, a Labor-Zionist youth movement which promotes the ideals of communal living and sharing, in a Kibbutz-like environment. The camp promotes the ideals of the youth movement to roughly 200 participating campers, ages 9 through 15 each summer.\n\nHabonim Dror is a Labor Zionist movement which provides programing and ideology to campers. Campers perform work (avodah) in the morning, which simulates living in a Kibbutz, where communal work benefits the whole society. There is an element of \"kupah\", which literally means 'cash register' in Hebrew, but is interpreted to mean 'sharing'. The basic principle of sharing at Camp Tavor is give what you can, take what you need. All campers contribute to \"kupah\" and therefore feel an equal part of and responsibility for our community. Campers are educated during Peulot, or age group activities, on the ideals of Habonim Dror, as well as on topics relevant to society today such as environmentalism and social justice. Other activities throughout the day range from sports such as canoeing, swimming, basketball and Ga-ga to games with the entire camp of Capture the Flag or other Camp Tavor favorites.\n\nCamp Tavor is a Jewish summer camp that has sessions available to campers varying in length from one to seven weeks.\n\nExplore Tavor is a two-week session\n\nFirst Session is three weeks long, with a visitors day two weeks into the session \n\nSecond Session is four weeks long, with a visitors day about 3 weeks into the session \n\nThe Full Season is from the beginning of First Session through the end of Second Session\n\nTavor reopens mid-Fall for Fall Seminar, which takes place over a weekend and is a fun reunion for campers and counselors alike. The program imitates normal Shabbat programing at camp.\n\nCamp Tavor welcomes a wide variety of age groups. The age groups are: <br>\n\nAmelimot - Post 3rd and 4th grade,<br>\n\nChotrimot (rowers) - Post 5th and 6th Grades,<br>\n\nBonimot (builders) - Post 7th Grade,<br>\n\nGarinimot (seeds) - Post 8th Grade,<br>\n\nBogrimot (graduates) - Post 9th Grade, <br>\n\nMadatz (counselors in training) - Post 11th Grade. <br>\n\nHebrew suffixes have been changed to \"imot\" in place of either \"im\" or \"ot\" within Camp Tavor and Habonim Dror North America in order to promote more gender inclusive language\n\nCamp Tavor also hosts Kadima, a three week program exploring Judaism in the Midwest, that any Post-tenth grade member of Habonim Dror North America may be a part of.\n\nShabbat at Tavor is a very relaxed and reflective experience (of the soul). Friday afternoons allow time to dress nicely and prepare for Kabbalat Shabbat. Kabbalat Shabbat includes a unique flag lowering service followed by a trip to Shabbat Hill to sing and watch the sunset. Following dinner, zemirot are sung and the rest of the night is spent Israeli Folk Dancing on the basketball courts.\n\nSaturday at Camp Tavor is a very laid back day, with a sleep in and the tradition of pancakes for breakfast. There is also time for Jewish storytelling, as well as chugei ritzonim (serious chuggim) about topics relating to anything from ancient Judaism to current events. Before dinner on Saturday, the campers will have the opportunity to showcase their musical talents in a weekly Musicale talent show.\n\n"}

Cooley High School is located at the intersection of Hubbell Avenue and Chalfonte Street, on the northwest side of Detroit, Michigan. The three-story, Mediterranean Revival-style facility opened its doors on September 4, 1928.\n\nThe school was named in honor of Thomas M. Cooley, a nineteenth-century jurist and former Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Cooley was also a charter member, and first chairman, of the Federal Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\nDue to budget constraints and declining enrollment, Cooley High School was closed at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year. On September 30, 2017, a fire severely damaged the auditorium and surrounding rooms.\n\nCooley High School's history dates to the late 1920s, a time when thousands of homes were built upon land acquired through Detroit's westernmost annexation efforts in the former Greenfield Township, and village of Strathmoor. Cooley High was constructed to accommodate a rapidly growing populace on the city's burgeoning northwest side.\n\nThe first five years of Cooley's existence was marked by rapid growth. In 1928, the student population stood at 1570, by 1932 the figure had climbed to 3750. That same year, noted author and motion picture celebrity, Frank Buck visited Cooley High School; Buck thrilled a packed auditorium audience with travelogues of recent African excursions.\n\nIn the early years, Cooley students enjoyed a diverse offering of extracurricular activities; including such pursuits as fencing, table tennis, indoor track and field, swimming and diving, speed skating and ice hockey. Throughout much of the twentieth century, in a wide variety of sports, Cooley student-athletes regularly finished at or near the top in the quest for city league (DPSSAL) supremacy.\n\nBeyond the sporting venues of metropolitan Detroit, the Cardinals of Thomas M. Cooley High School will be remembered as one of the most successful programs in the history of Michigan interscholastic athletics.\n\nIn 1932, the Cooley Cardinal football team won the Metropolitan League-Northern Division Championship; finishing the regular season at 7-0. In those seven games, only Mackenzie High School put points on the board versus the Cardinals. Three members of Cooley's legendary 1932 football team were selected to the Detroit News All-Metropolitan Team. That same school year, Cooley won the Detroit Public Secondary Schools Athletic League title in ice hockey and tennis; adding DPSSAL runner-up trophies in track and field and cross-country.\n\nClaude Snarey, long time Cooley educator and track coach, was a six-time Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association track and field champion for Michigan Normal College (the forerunner of Eastern Michigan University). Between 1923-26, Snarey won MIAA titles in the 100, 220 and 440-yard dash. Claude Snarey was a 1991 inductee to the EMU Athletic Hall of Fame; the football stadium at Livonia-Franklin High School is named in his honor.\n\nDuring the 1941 football season, Coach Herb Smith led the Cooley Cardinals to a 9-0-1 record; Michigan sportswriters rewarded Cooley High with a consensus state championship.\n\nFuture Major League Baseball All-Star Milt Pappas led Cooley to consecutive Metropolitan League Baseball Championships in 1956 and 1957. Milt won a total of 209 games during his 17-year professional career; he pitched a no-hitter as a member of the 1972 Chicago Cubs.\n\nFrom 1954 through 1964, Cooley football teams posted an eleven-season record of 60-14-8; representing an impressive winning percentage of 81. As the 1960s unfolded, the Cardinals were a dominant force on the Detroit high school football scene. In 1961, Cooley finished 7-1; cracking the Associated Press Top-Ten rankings for the first time - ending the season rated tenth. The 1962 and 1963 teams were undefeated, producing a combined regular-season record of 15-0; both squads were ranked fourth in respective final AP polling.\n\nThanks in large measure to the guidance of Abe Eliowitz and Roger Parmentier, Cooley's football program rose to great heights during the 1950s and 60s. Eliowitz taught and coached at Cooley from 1947 until 1970. Prior to earning his teaching credentials, Abe was an All-American footballer at Michigan State University. Eliowitz also played five seasons in the Canadian Football League; he was inducted to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1969. Roger Parmentier played collegiate football at Wayne State University; he was captain of the 1953 squad. To this day, Coach Parmentier's winning percentage is recognized as the best in DPSSAL football history; Roger was inducted to the Michigan High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964, Coach Harold Lindsay's swimming and diving program won five consecutive DPSSAL crowns for Cooley High School. In statewide competition, at the 1962 Michigan High School Athletic Association championships, All-American William \"Bill\" Jennison won a silver medal in the 100-yard butterfly; while Cooley's 200-yard freestyle relay quartet finished in fourth place. One year later, at the 1963 state finals, Jennison struck gold with his \"national high school\" record time of :52.60 in the butterfly event; Bill's performance remained on the books as the MHSAA record until 1971.\nJennison and fellow Cooley Cardinal, Joanne Scarborough competed at the 1964 US Olympic Trials.\n\nJohn Pheney was an All-City swimmer and co-captain of Cooley's DPSSAL championship teams in 1963 and 1964; John placed 9th in the 100-yard backstroke at the 1963 MHSAA finals. Ten years later, Pheney coached Ann Arbor-Huron High School to the 1973 MHSAA team title in boys' swimming and diving; under Pheney's tutelage, Huron High was also MHSAA team runner-up in 1972, 1977 and 1980.\n\nOther than Bill Jennison, the only Cardinal swimmer to make finals at a MHSAA championship was Robert Foley. By virtue of his 5th-place finish in the 200-yard individual medley and a 7th place showing in the 100-yard butterfly, Foley scored 17 team points for Cooley High at the 1967 state meet. Foley returned to the state swimming finals, in 1968; scoring 19 points for Cooley with a 5th in the individual medley and a 6th in the butterfly event.\n\nThroughout Cooley's eighty-two year history, the men's basketball program enjoyed top-level success; the Cardinals were DPSSAL champions in 1973. During the late-1980s, in statewide competition, Cooley basketball reigned supreme; Coach Ben Kelso led the Cardinals to consecutive Michigan High School Athletic Association Championship titles in 1987, 1988, and 1989. Cooley won another DPSSAL basketball crown in 1992.\n\nThe 1982 Lady Cardinal basketball team won MHSAA District and Regional crowns; advancing all the way to the state tournament quarterfinal round versus five-time defending champion, Flint Northern High School.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1984, Cardinal football teams produced a 10-season record of 68-20 (.772). Cooley's 1980 squad went 9-0, earning a third place Associated Press ranking; the 1981 Cardinals finished 8-1, ending the season rated tenth.\n\nOver the years, numerous Cooley track and field athletes have won individual DPSSAL and MHSAA gold medals; the Cardinals have also fared well in their quest for a state team title. In 1984 and 1985, Cooley's men finished as runners-up at the MHSAA Track and Field Finals. In 1991, Cooley High School brought home the MHSAA men's track and field championship trophy. At the 1991 championships, Cooley's 1600-meter relay team of Adams, David Norman, Johnson and Marco West established a MHSAA Class-A record of 3:16.05; the mark was not bettered until 2002.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the oldest towns in the country, and its population is 11,903 as of March 2014.\n\nThe parish Church is dedicated to Philip of Agira and the feast is celebrated on the 2nd Sunday of June, although the actual feast day falls on the 12th day of May. The name of the town literally means \"olives\" in Maltese; it derives from the large olive groves that stood in and around the current location of the church and the centre of the town. The town was bestowed with the title of \"Città Rohan\" by Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John on 21 June 1777. As was the custom in such events, the people of Ħaż-Żebbuġ built an archway known as the De Rohan Arch at the entrance to their hometown by way of marking the incipiency of its status as a city. The gateway, also known by the locals as \"Il-Bieb il-Ġdid\" (Maltese for \"The New Gateway\") still stands today. The town's coat-of-arms is also based on that of the House of Rohan.\n\nIn 1380 a church dedicated to St. Philip of Agira was built in \"Casal Zebugi\", a tract of land situated in the middle of the small communities which had developed during the previous Arab occupation of Malta, namely Ħal-Dwin, Ħal-Muxi and Ħal-Mula and which were eventually joined together forming the village known till today as Ħaż-Żebbuġ. Filippo de Catania \"il-Kataniż\" (Philip of Catania) a wealthy entrepreneur owning land in Ħaż-Żebbuġ funded part of the construction of St. Philip Church built on his own land. Long years after it became the parish church another one, designed by Tumas Dingli, was erected in its stead in the late seventeenth century. The church boasts a magnificent titular painting by Luca Garnier and two spectacular murals by the great Maltese 18th Century painter of the Favray school, Francesco Zahra, which critics consider to be his best works. Among other treasures the Church possesses an artefact attributed to Guido Reni and several others by Antonio Sciortino. The statue of St. Philip, by sculptor Luigi Fontana, was created in 1864 and is regarded by connoisseurs as the most beautiful of its genre in the country. \n\nWhen Malta was an independent principality under the sovereign Order of St. John, Ħaż-Żebbuġ was among the chief towns after Valletta and Mdina, first because of the presence of leading corsairs among its inhabitants, subsequently due to its major role in the cotton industry. The magnificence of St Philip's Church is the foremost evidence of the pre-eminent place Ħaż-Żebbuġ enjoys in Maltese history.\n\nThe locals or \"Żebbuġin\" as they are known in Malta are renowned for their business acumen amongst others, and there is a local saying to this end. Due to the Żebbuġin's Francophile past, the town was regarded as a friendly community when the Revolutionary French took Malta. During their rule in Malta (1798-1800), the local churches were plundered for their riches in order to fund Napoleon's campaign. The Ħaż-Żebbuġ locals opened the main door to the church when they heard the French were coming and hastily hid the gold and silver religious iconography. When the French saw the open doors of the church they kept on going and the Żebbuġin retained their religious riches.\n\nMalta is very rich in archaeological remains and Ħaż-Żebbuġ is no exception. It gave its name to an era of prehistoric time when pottery of a kind not known as yet was found in tombs in the area known as \"Ta' Trapna\". Later archaeological finds constructed at around the same time were subsequently known as \"Żebbuġ phase\" remains. A scattering of Punic and Phoenician tombs were also found together with a small number of cart ruts and other remains.\n\nĦaż-Żebbuġ is renowned for its spectacular festas dedicated to the Patron Saint St. Philip of Agira and to St. Joseph, a secondary feast. There are three band clubs in Ħaż-Żebbuġ, all of which have respective fireworks factories: De Rohan Band Club (established in 1860), St. Philip's Band Club (established in 1851) and the 12 May Band and Social Club (established in 1961). \n\nĦaż-Żebbuġ is the birthplace of various prominent Maltese personalities who have adorned the national cultural history down the ages, such as Mikiel Anton Vassalli (father of the written Maltese language), Dun Mikiel Xerri (patriot), Francesco Saverio Caruana (Bishop and Pariot during the French period, Nicolo Isouard (composer), Dun Karm Psaila (Malta's national poet), Antonio Sciortino (sculptor), Lazzaro Pisani (painter) and Frans Sammut (contemporary author).\n\nĦaż-Żebbuġ is the locality where the French Ambassador to Malta lives in what used to be previously the Palazzo Manduca. \nThe Grand Chancery of the Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem is also situated in the city.\n\nThe Zebbug Local Council, which represents the Zebbug residents, joined the European Forum for Urban Security and, in 2011, was elected to the EFUS Executive Committee.\n\nŻebbuġ is twinned with:\n\nThe city also has a cooperation agreement with:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Able to play at full-back or more commonly as a defensive midfielder, he picked up a reputation in the Football League as an aggressive player in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nHe turned professional at his boyhood club Arsenal in September 1962, and became a first team regular after making his debut in October 1965. He spent 15 years at the club, winning the\nInter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, the First Division title in 1970–71, and the FA Cup in 1971. He also was a losing finalist in the 1968 and 1969 League Cup and the 1972 FA Cup Final. He also won 19 caps for England between April 1971 and June 1973. He was transferred to Fulham in March 1977 before announcing his retirement eight months later.\n\nAfter retiring from football he was convicted of various criminal offences; including keeping a brothel, and was jailed for three years for financing a plot to counterfeit gold coins. He has been married four times and has three sons and one daughter; he lives in southern France with his fourth wife.\n\nStorey was born on 7 September 1945 in Farnham, Surrey, to Edwin, a carpenter and builder, and Nellie, a part-time shop assistant. As a child he would occasionally accompany his father to matches at the Recreation Ground to see Aldershot play in the Fourth Division. However, he began supporting Arsenal from an early age. From the age of 11 he was coached by former Aldershot striker Charlie Mortimore for the Aldershot and Farnborough Schools Football Association. He soon attracted the attention of Arsenal with his performances at schoolboy level, and impressed across the back four enough to represent England Schoolboys.\n\nStorey signed as an apprentice at Arsenal after leaving school in 1961. As a young player he was focused on his career, and was not interested in frequenting nightclubs with his fellow apprentices. He signed professional forms in September 1962 and spent the 1962–63 season playing for the Arsenal third team in the Metropolitan League. A buildup of senior player on the books at Arsenal meant that Storey had little chance to play for the reserve team.\n\nHe made his senior debut on 30 October 1965, taking Billy McCullough's place at left-back in a 3–1 defeat to Leicester City at Filbert Street. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that he had a \"promising\" game against a \"clever\" opponent in right-winger Jackie Sinclair. He retained his first team place and went on to play all of the remaining 29 games, though the season would prove to be a poor one for the \"Gunners\" as manager Billy Wright was sacked after dropping top-scorer Joe Baker and disillusioning the dressing room. Arsenal finished in 14th place in 1965–66, just four points above the relegation zone, and were knocked out of the FA Cup at the Third Round following a 3–0 defeat to Blackburn Rovers, who would end the season bottom of the First Division.\n\nStorey quickly made a name for himself as a rough player early in the 1966–67 season as he injured Manchester City winger Mike Summerbee; the \"Daily Express\" reported that \"Storey... is overdoing the tough guy act\". He was warned by new manager Bertie Mee not to get sent off after Storey got involved in a brawl during an FA Cup win over Gillingham. The team improved under Mee's strict leadership, and finished the season in seventh place, cutting goals conceded to 47 from the previous season's tally of 75. Storey started 34 league games, missing eight matches due to injury and illness. He scored his first professional goal on 22 April 1967, in a 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest at Highbury.\n\nBob McNab established himself at left-back in the 1967–68 season, and so Storey was moved over to right-back. Despite being a full-back he was sometimes given the job of marking a dangerous and creative opposition player closely, and though he was never ordered to use rough play he was on these occasions told \"you know what to do, Peter\". He was sent off for the first time in his career, along with Frank McLintock, in a 1–0 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor in December 1967; despite his tough tackling he was actually dismissed for bad language. Arsenal finished the season in ninth place, but advanced past Coventry City, Reading, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Huddersfield Town to face Leeds United in the final of the League Cup at Wembley. Leeds won the game through a Terry Cooper volley on 20 minutes, and Arsenal barely created any chances in the game.\n\nArsenal reached fourth place in the 1968–69 season after conceding just 27 league goals, and advanced past Sunderland, Scunthorpe United, Liverpool, Blackpool and North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur to reach the final against Third Division side Swindon Town. Swindon won the match 3–1, with left-winger Don Rogers scoring two extra-time goals after evading the close attentions of Storey.\n\nTheir league position meant in 1968–69 that Arsenal qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1969–70 season, and they advanced past Glentoran (Northern Ireland), Sporting (Portugal), Rouen (France), FCM Bacău (Romania) and Ajax (Netherlands) to reach the final against Belgian club Anderlecht. Anderlecht won 3–1 at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium after their possession football controlled the entire game until substitute Ray Kennedy scored a crucial header in the 82nd minute. Arsenal turned around the tie with a 3–0 home victory to claim the club's first trophy in 17 years. Despite their European exploits the team still struggled in England, and finished the league in 12th spot.\n\nThey defended their European trophy up until the quarter-finals, knocking out Lazio (Italy), SK Sturm Graz (Austria) and K.S.K. Beveren (Belgium), before losing to German side 1. FC Köln on away goals despite a rare goal from Storey. The First Division title race was contested largely between Arsenal and Leeds, and the \"Gunners\" recovered from an indifferent winter to claim nine successive victories between 2 March and 20 April and eventually they finished on 65 points, one place and one point above Leeds. The most crucial match of the campaign came against Leeds at Elland Road on 25 April, which Leeds won 1–0 after an injury-time goal from Jack Charlton. During the game Billy Bremner stamped on Storey's face, though this was an accidental collision during a goalmouth scramble. Arsenal won the title on the final day of the season with a 1–0 win over Spurs at White Hart Lane, though Storey missed the final two league games of the season after damaging ligaments in his ankle. They secured the double in 1970–71 after winning the FA Cup, though their progress in the competition was slow, as they beat Yeovil Town, Portsmouth (in a replay) – Storey scored a penalty in both the original tie and the replay, Manchester City, Leicester City (in a replay), and then Stoke City (in a replay). Storey gave a man-of-the-match performance in the original semi-final tie against Stoke at Hillsborough, scoring two goals to rescue a 2–0 half-time deficit; with the first goal he beat Gordon Banks with a volley on the edge of the penalty area, and with the second he sent Banks the wrong way with an injury-time penalty kick. The replay at Villa Park was less dramatic, and Arsenal won the tie with a comfortable 2–0 result. In the final he was assigned to mark Liverpool's Steve Heighway, and kept the Liverpool winger quiet until Storey was substituted for Eddie Kelly after 64 minutes. Both Heighway and Kelly scored in extra-time, but the winning goal came from \"Gunners\" striker Charlie George.\nHe helped Arsenal to get off to a solid start in defence of their title in the 1971–72 campaign, before he picked up a thigh injury which caused him to miss a few weeks of games from late September. In December, Mee spent £220,000 on Everton midfielder Alan Ball, who took Storey's place in the first eleven for his debut on 27 December. In the new year Storey and numerous other Arsenal players confronted the club's management after learning that Ball was paid £250 a week – more than double most of the rest of the squad. Storey returned to the first team for an FA Cup clash with Derby County on 26 February, as Eddie Kelly was out injured. The next month Arsenal lost three away league games in a row, which all but ended their chances of retaining their title. Storey was out of the team as Arsenal progressed to the quarter-finals of the European Cup – though he did feature in the Second Round victory over Swiss club Grasshopper – and he proved unable to prevent a Johan Cruyff inspired Ajax from claiming a 3–1 aggregate victory. Arsenal progressed past Swindon Town, Reading, Derby County, Orient, and Stoke City to reach the 1972 FA Cup Final. Leeds United limited Arsenal in the final and a headed goal from Allan Clarke was enough to win the cup for Leeds with a 1–0 victory.\n\nStorey failed to pick up a winners medal in the 1972–73 season as Arsenal finished second in the league – three points behind Liverpool – and lost 2–1 to Sunderland in the FA Cup semi-finals. Arsenal had won at Anfield in February, but dropped points in the end of season run-in and ended the season with a 6–1 defeat to Leeds.\n\nArsenal started the 1973–74 season poorly and exited the League Cup at the hands of Third Division Tranmere Rovers before being knocked out of the FA Cup by Second Division Aston Villa. They eventually finished the league in tenth place, 20 points behind Leeds. The decline continued in the 1974–75 campaign, which ended with Arsenal finishing four places and four points above the relegation zone. Storey was mostly limited to the reserve team during the 1975–76 season, but injuries to Sammy Nelson and Eddie Kelly forced his return to the first team in the build-up to Christmas. On 8 March Storey was suspended by the club after refusing to turn up for work with the reserve team.\n\nMee retired in the summer of 1976, and his successor was Terry Neill, who was the Arsenal captain when Storey made his debut. He returned to the first team in spells, but the purchase of Alan Hudson in December 1976 spelt the end for Storey at Highbury. Storey played his final game for Arsenal on 29 January 1977, replacing Malcolm Macdonald as a substitute in a 3–1 victory over Coventry City in the FA Cup. He refused to train with the reserves and was again suspended by the club before accepting a free transfer to Fulham in March 1977.\n\nWhen Storey arrived at Craven Cottage, Fulham were one place above the Second Division relegation zone and under the management of Bobby Campbell; training was relaxed and superstar signings George Best, Bobby Moore and Rodney Marsh were past their best. Sttorey played 12 games at the end of the 1976–77 season, helping the \"Cottagers\" to finish out of the relegation zone. He featured in five league and two cup games at the start of the 1977–78 season, his final appearance as a professional football coming in a 1–0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 10 September. His contract with Fulham was cancelled in November 1977 and Storey announced his retirement from football.\n\nStorey made his England debut under Alf Ramsey on 21 April 1971, in a 3–0 win over Greece at Wembley in a qualifying game for UEFA Euro 1972. Despite at the time being used as a midfielder at club level he played at right-back as Ramsey wanted to assess his options at the full-back position; his rivals for the number 2 shirt were Keith Newton (Everton), Emlyn Hughes (Liverpool), Paul Reaney (Leeds United), Chris Lawler (Liverpool), and Paul Madeley (Leeds United). He almost did not play the game as Arsenal manager Bertie Mee ordered both Storey and teammate Bob McNab to pull out of the fixture to play a league game against Burnley the day before, but was allowed to play for England after coach Don Howe persuaded Mee to reconsider his decision. Storey picked up an assist in the match after providing the cross for Francis Lee's late header. His second cap came in a 1–0 British Home Championship win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park, in which he played in midfield and man-marked George Best.\n\nIn 1972, Storey sat on the bench for the first leg of the Euro '72 qualifying quarter-finals match with West Germany, which ended in a 3–1 defeat. He played in the return leg at the Olympiastadion, helping England to secure a 0–0 draw but not a place in the tournament. Despite the respectable draw Ramsey was criticised for naming a negative line-up when England needed a win. His performance in Berlin was the first of a run of 15 successive England appearances for Storey. He played in 1972's three British Home Championship games, helping England to finish joint-first in the tournament after he and Norman Hunter out-battled Billy Bremner, Denis Law and Bobby Moncur at Hampden Park in a 1–0 victory.\n\nHe made his final appearance for England in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Italy in Turin on 14 June 1973. He was on the bench for the crucial final game of qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, with Colin Bell favoured in midfield with Paul Madeley and Emlyn Hughes at full-back, as England drew 1–1 and failed to qualify for the tournament. He did though feature in one game for The Football League XI in a 5–0 win over Scottish Football League XI at Maine Road on 20 March 1974, having already featured for The Football League XI in a 2–1 win over the League of Ireland XI in Dublin on 22 September 1971.\n\nStorey began his career as a right-back, and soon picked up a reputation as a powerful tackler. Later in his career he was deployed as a defensive midfielder so as to break up opposition play further up the pitch. He gained a reputation as Arsenal's \"hard man\" in a violent era of British football where clubs would typically employ at least one tough player willing to use dirty play to hurt the opposition and to protect their own generally more skilled players. He later said that he made premeditated tackles from behind early in matches to try and intimidate opponents at a time when referees were reluctant to punish fouls. His rough play was frequently criticised by pundits, though during the 1970s the footballing authorities took little action to try and punish him or any other of football's \"hard men\". Teammate Bob McNab, quoted in \"Seventy-One Guns\" wrote that \"Peter was a nightmare for players when he marked them man for man\". He was also an efficient taker of penalty kicks, and the only penalties he missed had little bearing on the final result of the match.\n\nHis marriage to first wife Susan broke down six months after their marriage in summer 1969. She left him for good in February 1971 after tiring of his self-described \"boozy, carefree ways\". He met his second wife, Cathy McDonald, at London's Playboy Club in May 1972. The pair began living together before getting married in 1975. The couple had a daughter, Natalie, in December 1976. He married third wife Gill shortly before the arrival of she his son, Peter, born in November 1981. His second son, Anthony, was born in December 1982. His third son, Jamie, was born in September 1987. He later divorced Gill and married a Frenchwoman, Daniele Scorceletti. He later split from Daniele and got back together with Gill, before leaving Gill and his three sons to return to Daniele some years later. By 2010 he was in regular contact with his three sons, but has not seen daughter Natalie in decades.\n\nHis life began to fall apart in 1975 after he took a three-year tenancy agreement out on the \"Jolly Farmers\" pub on London's Southgate Road. At the time it was common for footballers to invest in pubs, as did other Arsenal teammates. His marriage to Cathy fell apart as he spent more nights at his pub, with the attractions of drink and women, than at home with his wife. He became more dependent on alcohol as his career at Arsenal came to an end. He also invested in a minicab firm in Newington Green, that failed.\n\nHe turned to crime when helping local gangsters, the Barry brothers, to counterfeit money by providing finance and storage of the cast die. He was arrested, and whilst on bail set up a brothel called the Calypso Massage Parlour with three women to try and raise enough money to flee to Spain to avoid his trial for conspiracy to produce counterfeit money. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to keeping a brothel on 22 December 1979, and was handed a £700 fine and a six-month suspended sentence. He was also briefly jailed for contempt of court after failing appear at his bankruptcy hearings. In September 1980 the trial for conspiracy to produce counterfeit money came to a conclusion and Storey was sentenced to three years imprisonment. He served his time at Wandsworth and Spring Hill. He was handed a 12-month suspended sentence in April 1982 for stealing two cars he had on hire purchase whilst running his minicab firm.\n\nAfter a time on unemployment benefits he worked on a market stall in Portobello Road. In 1990, he was jailed for 28 days for attempting to import 20 pornographic videos from Europe which he had hidden in a spare tyre. After his release he worked as a minicab driver in Islington ran by Tommy Adams. He spent 1995 in Istanbul working as a chauffeur for Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his entourage. In 2004, he moved to a village near Toulouse in Southern France with Daniele. He sold much of his football memorabilia and medals for £20,000.\n\nIn September 2010 he released a no-holds-barred autobiography, \"True Storey: My Life and Crimes as a Football Hatchet Man\"; a bio-film project fell through.\n\n\n\nSpecific\nGeneral\n"}

{"id": "2040428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040428", "title": "John Willard Young", "text": "John Willard Young\n\nJohn Willard Young (October 1, 1844 – February 12, 1924) was a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He is one of the few individuals to have been an apostle of the LDS Church and a member of the First Presidency without ever having been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nYoung was born in Nauvoo, Illinois to Latter Day Saint apostle Brigham Young and Mary Ann Angell. As a young boy, John traveled with the Mormon pioneers from Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nYoung was privately ordained an apostle by his father on November 22, 1855, when he was eleven, without a public announcement or adding them to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\nYoung's ordination was reconfirmed on February 4, 1864, when his brothers Brigham Young, Jr. and Joseph Angell Young were ordained apostles by their father. However, none of them became members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles upon their ordination because the Quorum already had twelve members. Although Brigham Jr. eventually became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, John and Joseph never did.\n\nIn 1869, Young opened the \"Salt Lake City Museum and Menagerie\", which was the predecessor of the Deseret Museum. He was also involved with the construction of a railroad in Arizona Territory.\n\nOn April 8, 1873, Brigham Young added John, Brigham Jr., George Q. Cannon, Lorenzo Snow, and Albert Carrington as additional counselors to him in the First Presidency. After Young's First Counselor George A. Smith died in September 1875, John Willard Young was called as First Counselor to his father on October 8, 1876. Young served in this capacity until the First Presidency was dissolved by Brigham Young's death less than a year later on August 29, 1877. During his time in the First Presidency, John Willard Young never spent much time in Salt Lake City attending to church leadership duties; since 1863 he had preferred living in New York City, where he was engaged in a number of business ventures that ultimately failed and resulted in him assuming a large amount of debt.\n\nHaving never been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve but holding the priesthood office of apostle, Young was called as a counselor to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 6, 1877. However, Young's business practices and practice of living in New York City soon brought him into conflict with other church authorities. At a general conference of the church on April 6, 1881, Young's name was withheld from the names of general authorities who were presented for \"sustaining\". Between 1881 and 1885, he was tried before the Quorum of the Twelve on three separate occasions; each time he was reconciled with the Twelve and he retained his position. In 1888, Joseph F. Smith accused Young of unethically using church funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle, and by April 1889 the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve were discussing removing Young from his position.\n\nYoung resigned from his position on October 3, 1891; Young was aware that on that date the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were again discussing his possible release from his position. After Young's resignation, he was formally released as a counselor to the Twelve at a conference of the church October 6, 1891.\n\nAlthough he lived another 33 years, Young never again served as a general authority of the LDS Church, though he remained a church apostle for the rest of his life. On December 9, 1899, apostle Franklin D. Richards died. Richards had been the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the second-most senior apostle in the church. Richards's death left Young as the second-most senior apostle in the church. Although Young did not become the President of the Twelve, under the then-existing rules of presidential succession in the church, Young would become the President of the Church when Lorenzo Snow died, since Snow was the only living person who had been ordained an apostle prior to Young. Snow was 85 years old and in poor health, while Young was only 55 years old; it therefore appeared to many that Young would be the next president of the church.\n\nHowever, many of the general authorities of the church disliked Young and felt that his succession to the presidency would be a disaster for the church. On March 31, 1900, the First Presidency—which consisted of Lorenzo Snow, George Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith—changed the policy of presidential succession. The new president of the church would no longer be the person who had been an ordained apostle the longest; rather, the new president of the church would be the person who had been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for the longest period of time. Since Young had never been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, he could not become the president of the church if Snow died. On April 5, 1900, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve unanimously approved the new policy.\n\nOn October 10, 1901, Snow died. Five days later, Young arrived in Salt Lake City from New York City, possibly with the intent of assuming the presidency of the church. However, due to the new policy, Joseph F. Smith was ordained the new president of the church on October 17, 1901. Young returned to New York City, where he lived for the rest of his life. After he died in New York City, Young was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.\n\nAfter returning to New York City, Young was employed as an elevator operator in an exclusive hotel where he had once lived. In 1902 and 1903, his son Hooper Young was involved in a sensational murder investigation and trial after it was determined that a woman had died in John Willard Young's apartment while he was in France on business. The \"Pulitzer Murder\" case ultimately resulted in Hooper pleading guilty to second degree murder and being sentenced to life imprisonment in Sing Sing prison. Hooper's conviction had a devastating effect on John Willard, who had initially believed that his son was innocent. John Willard Young continued to attend a branch of the LDS Church in the city for the rest of his life, and he died of cancer in New York City at the age of 79.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040445", "title": "Hanif Mohammad", "text": "Hanif Mohammad\n\nHanif Mohammad (, 21 December 1934 – 11 August 2016) was a Pakistani cricketer. \n\nHe played for the Pakistani cricket team in 55 Test matches between the 1952–53 season and the 1969–70 season. He averaged 43.98 scoring twelve centuries. At his peak, he was considered one of the best batsmen in the world despite playing at a time when Pakistan played very little Test cricket; Hanif played just 55 Test matches in a career spanning 17 years. In his obituary by ESPNcricinfo, he was honoured as the original Little Master, a title later assumed by Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. He was the first Pakistani to score a triple hundred in a Test match.\n\nHanif was trained by Abdul Aziz, an Afghan cricket player, who had earlier played in Ranji Trophy for Jamnagar and father of Indian cricketer, Salim Durani. He made his first-class debut playing for Pakistan against the MCC in November 1951. He made 26 in 165 minutes.\n\nThe highest of Hanif's Test centuries was a famous 337 made against West Indies in a six-day test at Bridgetown in 1957/58, the highest Test innings at the time. After Pakistan found itself following on from a first-innings deficit of 473 runs on the afternoon of the third day, Hanif spent more than sixteen hours at the crease compiling his runs, allowing Pakistan to draw the game. It remains the longest innings in Test history (and stood as the longest in all first-class cricket for over 40 years). It was the only Test match instance of a triple century in a team's second innings until it was equaled by New Zealand cricketer Brendon McCullum against India in 2014. Displays such as this earned him the nickname \"Little Master\". Hanif Mohammad also has the world record for scoring the slowest test triple century in terms of minutes (858) and the only player in test history to have spent over 970 minutes to score a test triple ton.\n\nIn 1958–59, he surpassed Don Bradman's record for the highest individual first-class innings. Hanif made 499 for Karachi in a match against Bahawalpur before being run out attempting his five hundredth run; this stood for more than 35 years before being passed by Brian Lara in 1994. In all he made 55 first-class centuries and finished with a strong first-class career average of 52.32. He could bowl with either arm, and kept wicket on a number of occasions. He is known to have played the slowest test innings when he scored 20 off 223 balls at a strike rate of 8.97.\n\nHanif's career lasted until 1975–76, but he never played in the English County Championship, although he did have an outing for the Northamptonshire Second XI in August 1965 whilst preparing for his appearance for a Rest of the World XI against England at the Scarborough Festival a few days later. Hanif was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1968 and in January 2009 he was named along with two other Pakistani players, Imran Khan and Javed Miandad, among the inaugural batch of 55 inductees into the ICC's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn one Test match against Australia, Hanif scored a century in the first innings. In the second, he was given out stumped by Barry Jarman off the bowling of Tom Veivers for 93. Hanif respected the umpire's decision. Later in a press conference Jarman admitted that Hanif was not out.\n\nIn 1972, after retiring from international cricket, Hanif co-founded the magazine \"The Cricketer Pakistan\". He edited this magazine for two decades. He also served as the team manager for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).\n\nMany other members of Hanif's family were also cricketers: his brothers Mushtaq, Sadiq and Wazir all played Tests for Pakistan, as did his son Shoaib. Another brother Raees was once twelfth man for Pakistan, and four nephews had first-class careers. His mother Ameer Bee was a national badminton champion in pre-independence British India.\n\nHanif Mohammad was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2013. He had been undergoing treatment for lung cancer in Karachi's Aga Khan Hospital. He died on 11 August 2016 at age 81.\n\nIn 2018, a Google Doodle was created to celebrate his 84th Birthday. Hanif's triple-century against the West Indies team in 1957/58 made him a legend in the cricketing world. He was one of the original inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n \n"}

It is named after Erwin Madelung, a German physicist.\n\nBecause the anions and cations in an ionic solid attract each other by virtue of their opposing charges, separating the ions requires a certain amount of energy. This energy must be given to the system in order to break the anion–cation bonds. The energy required to break these bonds for one mole of an ionic solid under standard conditions is the lattice energy.\n\nThe Madelung constant allows for the calculation of the electric potential \"V\" of all ions of the lattice felt by the ion at position \"r\"\n\nwhere \"r\" = |\"r\" − \"r\"| is the distance between the \"i\"th and the \"j\"th ion. In addition,\n\nIf the distances \"r\" are normalized to the nearest neighbor distance \"r\" the potential may be written\n\nwith formula_3 being the (dimensionless) Madelung constant of the \"i\"th ion\n\nAnother convention is to base the reference length on the cubic root of the unit cell volume, which for cubic systems is equal to the lattice constant. Thus, the Madelung constant then reads\n\nThe electrostatic energy of the ion at site formula_6 then is the product of its charge with the potential acting at its site\n\nThere occur as many Madelung constants formula_3 in a crystal structure as ions occupy different lattice sites. For example, for the ionic crystal NaCl, there arise two Madelung constants – one for Na and another for Cl. Since both ions, however, occupy lattice sites of the same symmetry they both are of the same magnitude and differ only by sign. The electrical charge of the Na and Cl ion are assumed to be onefold positive and negative, respectively, formula_9 and formula_10. The nearest neighbour distance amounts to half the lattice constant of the cubic unit cell formula_11 and the Madelung constants become\n\nThe prime indicates that the term formula_13 is to be left out. Since this sum is conditionally convergent it is not suitable as definition of Madelung's constant unless the order of summation is also specified. There are two \"obvious\" methods of summing this series, by expanding cubes or expanding spheres. The latter, though devoid of a meaningful physical interpretation (there are no spherical crystals) is rather popular because of its simplicity. Thus, the following expansion is often found in the literature:\n\nHowever, this is wrong as this series diverges as was shown by Emersleben in 1951. The summation over expanding cubes converges to the correct value. An unambiguous mathematical definition is given by Borwein, Borwein and Taylor by means of analytic continuation of an absolutely convergent series.\n\nThere are many practical methods for calculating Madelung's constant using either direct summation (for example, the Evjen method) or integral transforms, which are used in the Ewald method.\n\nThe continuous reduction of formula_15 with decreasing coordination number formula_16 for the three cubic AB compounds (when accounting for the doubled charges in ZnS) explains the observed propensity of alkali halides to crystallize in the structure with highest formula_16 compatible with their ionic radii. Note also how the fluorite structure being intermediate between the caesium chloride and sphalerite structures is reflected in the Madelung constants.\n\nA fast converging formula for the Madelung constant of NaCl is\n\nformula_18\n\nIt is assumed for the calculation of Madelung constants that an ion's charge density may be approximated by a point charge. This is allowed, if the electron distribution of the ion is spherically symmetric. In particular cases, however, when the ions reside on lattice site of certain crystallographic point groups, the inclusion of higher order moments, i.e. multipole moments of the charge density might be required. It is shown by electrostatics that the interaction between two point charges only accounts for the first term of a general Taylor series describing the interaction between two charge distributions of arbitrary shape. Accordingly, the Madelung constant only represents the monopole-monopole term.\n\nThe electrostatic interaction model of ions in solids has thus been extended to a point multipole concept that also includes higher multipole moments like dipoles, quadrupoles etc. These concepts require the determination of higher order Madelung constants or so-called electrostatic lattice constants. The proper calculation of electrostatic lattice constants has to consider the crystallographic point groups of ionic lattice sites; for instance, dipole moments may only arise on polar lattice sites, i. e. exhibiting a \"C\", \"C\", \"C\" or \"C\" site symmetry (\"n\" = 2, 3, 4 or 6). These second order Madelung constants turned out to have significant effects on the lattice energy and other physical properties of heteropolar crystals.\n\nThe Madelung constant is also a useful quantity in describing the lattice energy of organic salts. Izgorodina and coworkers have described a generalised method (called the EUGEN method) of calculating the Madelung constant for any crystal structure.\n\n"}

Established in 1978, the NPS-protected area stretches for from just downstream of Hinton to Hawks Nest State Park near Ansted.\n\nNew River Gorge is also home to some of the country's best whitewater rafting. The focus of this rafting is in the New River Gorge from the Cunard put-in to the Fayette Station take-out. The river levels for the New River Gorge (and most other major whitewater rivers in the United States) can be checked at American Whitewater.\n\nNew River Gorge is also one of the most popular climbing areas on the east coast with over 1,400 established rock climbs. The cliffs at \"The New\" are located just below the rim of the gorge and are made up of a very hard Nuttall sandstone. The rock is very featured, and an abundance of crack and face routes, with occasional large roofs. Almost all climbs are one pitch long and range from 30 to in height. The majority of the routes in the gorge are for advanced climbers in 5.10-5.12 range of the Yosemite Decimal System with about an equal number of traditional and sport climbs.\n\nNew River Gorge National River was established in 1978 as a unit of the national park system. Located in the Appalachian Mountains of southern West Virginia, the park encompasses over of land along of the New River from Bluestone Dam to Hawks Nest State Park. A rugged, white water river, flowing northward through deep canyons, the New River is among the oldest rivers on the continent. The park is rich in cultural and natural history and offers an abundance of scenic and recreational opportunities.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter signed legislation establishing New River Gorge National River on November 10, 1978 (Public Law 95-625). As stated in the legislation, the park was established as a unit of the national park system \"for the purpose of conserving and interpreting outstanding natural, scenic, and historic values and objects in and around the New River Gorge and preserving as a free-flowing stream an important segment of the New River in West Virginia for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.\" In 2019, bills were introduced in the U.S. Congress to redesignate the unit as New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.\n\nFlowing water is the creative force shaping the geologic features of the New River Gorge as the river continues to sculpt the longest and deepest river gorge in the Appalachian Mountains. On display in the gorge one can find a variety of unique geologic features and processes that exemplify the geology of the Appalachian Plateau, including the exposure of over of sandstone and shale, house-sized boulders scattered from rim to river, plant and invertebrate fossils, and steep channel drop-offs. The river has exposed four seams of coal, considered among the best bituminous coal in the world. The smokeless New River coal once fed the boilers of the nation's trains, factories, fleets and power plants, and its coke fueled the nation's iron furnaces.\n\nThe waters of the New River system contain a mosaic of hydrologic features and aquatic habitats that support a unique aquatic ecosystem and nourish a riparian zone that supports rare plants, animals, and communities. The waters provide a surprising variety and density of riverine hydrologic features and processes unparalleled in the Eastern United States, including pools, backwaters, glides, runs, shoals, riffles, torrents, cascades, chutes, rapids and waterfalls.\n\nThe river is a highly productive aquatic ecosystem that includes distinct populations of native fish (many found nowhere else), mussels, crayfish, and a broad array of other aquatic life, including rare amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The riparian zone is the most biologically diverse part of the park and contains globally rare communities and essential habitat for several rare species. The New River is a dynamic aquatic ecosystem that supports smallmouth bass and other game fish, mussels, crayfish, other invertebrates, and aquatic plants.\n\nNew River Gorge National River lies at the core of a globally significant forest containing the most diverse flora of any river gorge in central and southern Appalachia and provides essential habitat for endangered mammals and rare birds and amphibians. The park contains habitats of continuous forest, cliff and rimrock, forest seeps and wetlands, mature bottomland forests, abandoned mine portals (providing a refuge for rare species, including bats, amphibians, and the Allegheny woodrat; a species of special concern in West Virginia and in decline throughout the eastern United States). New River Gorge offers shelter to at least 63 species of mammals including the endangered Virginia big-eared and Indiana bats. The river, stream tributaries, and forest provide habitat for 48 known species of amphibians including the eastern hellbender, black-bellied salamander, and cave salamander.\n\nDiverse populations of birds such as wood warblers, vireos, and thrushes spend part of their lives in the tropics but depend upon the unfragmented forests of the New River Gorge for breeding. The region is a vital link in the north-south migratory flyway. Each year, thousands of hawks fly across the region during the fall migratory season. The National Park Service and West Virginia Department of Natural Resources have initiated a multi-year program to restore peregrine falcons to New River Gorge. These majestic birds soar and dive near the cliffs.\n\nForty different plant communities containing at least 1,342 species and 54 rare plants have been identified in the gorge.\n\nWithin the gorge is a wealth of historically significant abandoned places, some in ruins and some stabilized and rehabilitated, where people worked and lived during the late 18th and 19th centuries, supplying the coal and lumber that helped fuel American industry. Remnants of the park's past, hidden in the forest, tell the stories of earlier life in the Appalachian Mountains. On display are the tangible remains of historic coal mining structures and coke ovens of unmatched integrity — such as at Nuttallburg Coal Mining Complex and Town Historic District and Kay Moor — and the historic structures and ruins associated with more than 50 company-owned towns.\n\nThe New River Gorge region was opened up to the outside world in 1873 with the coming of the railroad. In the park, there are old railroad depots, rail yards, rail grades, steel and timber trestle bridges, railroad equipment, archeological sites and associated towns, like Thurmond, that were developed to support the railroad. The history and archeology associated with the lumbering industry can be seen in the ruins of old towns like Hamlet. Also contributing to the area's rich cultural history are surviving examples of subsistence farms, former community sites, homesteads, and other places in the park where the ancestors of families long associated with the New River lived and worked.\n\nThe Lower Gorge of the New River is a premier whitewater rafting location that attracts thrillseekers from all over the country and the world. The rapids, ranging in difficulty from Class III to Class V, are imposing and forceful, many of them obstructed by large boulders which necessitate maneuvering in very powerful currents, crosscurrents, and hydraulics. Commercial outfitters conduct trips down the river from April through October. The upper part of the river offers somewhat less challenging class I to III rapids for whitewater canoeing. The National Park Service website lists all the licensed outfitters on their Commercial Whitewater Information page.\n\nNew River Gorge National River has become one of the most popular rock climbing areas in the country. Within the park are over 1,400 established rock climbs. The cliffs at New River Gorge are made up of hard sandstone and range from 30 to in height.\n\nFishing is one of the most popular activities on the New River. The diversity of fish in its waters makes the New River an excellent warm water fishery.\n\nThere are over of hiking trails in the park ranging from easy walks to more challenging hikes. Several trails following old railroad grades are open to bikes. There are four primitive camping areas within the park, all located along the river.\n\nThere are two year-round visitor centers located at Sandstone and Canyon Rim.\n\nNew River Gorge National River is renowned for its excellent recreational opportunities: whitewater rafting, canoeing, hiking, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, bird watching, camping, picnicking, biking, and enjoying the solitude of the natural world.\n\nSuperintendent James W.

{"id": "2040458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040458", "title": "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing", "text": "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\n\nTales of a Fourth Grade Nothing is a children's novel written by American author Judy Blume and published in 1972. It is the first in the Fudge Series and was followed by \"Superfudge\", \"Fudge-a-Mania\", and \"Double Fudge\" (2002). Although \"Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great\" features many of the same characters as the series, it does not fit exactly in the continuity of it because, as a spin-off, it only focuses on Peter's classmate (who later becomes his cousin-in-law), Sheila Tubman.\n\nOriginally, the book featured illustrations by Roy Doty, but all post-2002 reprints of it have omitted the pictures.\n\nThe story focuses on a nine-year-old boy named Peter Warren Hatcher and his relationship with his two-and-a-half-year-old brother, Farley Drexel \"Fudge\" Hatcher. Farley hates the sound of his legal name, and prefers Fudge for any and all occasions.\n\nThe book focuses on 9-year-old 4th grader Peter Hatcher's frustration with the horrendous behavior demonstrated by his annoying 2½-year-old brother, Fudge, who frequently goes unpunished. Peter becomes frustrated with Fudge because he often disturbs Dribble, Peter's pet turtle, which Peter won at his best friend Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. Furthermore, Fudge throws nonstop temper tantrums, goes through a finicky phase of abstaining from eating altogether, and emulates Peter's behavior, throwing tantrums if it is prohibited. Nevertheless, their parents dote on Fudge, to Peter's anger and frustration.\n\nFor months, Fudge's antics continue; breaking his front teeth after catapulting himself from the jungle gym at the local playground when he decides to fly, vandalizing Peter's group homework assignment, and taking off on his family at a movie theater (Chapter 9: Just Another Rainy Day). One day, to Peter's absolute misery, he returns home to discover Dribble is missing from his bowl, Fudge claiming to have swallowed him. These proclamations prove to be correct, and Fudge is rushed to the hospital, where Dribble is extracted, to Mrs. Hatcher's relief. However, Dribble has died in Fudge's stomach, and no one, especially Fudge, seems to care. Peter is devastated over the loss of his beloved pet; his parents sympathetically compensate by adopting a dog, which Peter appropriately names \"Turtle\" in memory of Dribble.\n\nPeter Warren Hatcher – The protagonist of the story, and a smart, assertive, but seemingly naive 9-year-old boy. Most of the book focuses upon his relationship with Fudge and his family, and the fact that Fudge is the perceived source of all of his troubles. His parents usually seem to let Fudge get away with anything and everything, and though it does appear that Peter's needs and wants are often ignored and overshadowed in favor of Fudge's, this is not always the case. \n\nPeter believes that his parents show Fudge preferential treatment, especially Anne; he also is frequently frustrated when Fudge gets into his things and tries to become involved in his activities. However, Peter does love him very much and shows concern when he is hospitalized (after swallowing Peter's pet turtle, Dribble) and the doctors speculate that they may need to operate on him. Peter is very upset when he learns that Dribble is dead and is furious when he sees Fudge get showered with attention and gifts when he comes home, but then Warren comes home with a dog for Peter for being \"a good sport\" and to compensate for the loss.\n\nFarley Drexel \"Fudge\" Hatcher – Peter's younger brother, whom he often resents. At the beginning of the book, Fudge (a nickname for his much-despised legal name, Farley Drexel) is two years old, and turns three in Chapter 5. He is a very loud, demanding, and mischievous toddler who is prone to violent temper tantrums. He has a very active imagination, and others – including Sheila Tubman and the wife of one of his father's clients – adore him. In the final chapter, he swallows Dribble whole and is hospitalized, but the doctors are able to help him expel Dribble's remains without surgery. Peter often sees him as a pest, but Fudge looks up to his big brother, and eventually Peter realizes the bond that they have.\n\nAnne Hatcher – The mother of Peter and Fudge, and wife of Warren. A caring mother, she shows love and devotion to her family and is very protective of Fudge. Her sometimes overprotective ways with him sometimes cause problems for Peter; for example, when Fudge jumps off the jungle gym at the playground (believing he is a bird that will land safely), she scolds Peter severely, holding him solely responsible for Fudge's injuries and not even listening to his side of the story. She later admits to becoming overly emotional with the aftermath of Fudge's flying experience and taking it out on Peter. When Fudge ruined Peter's school project, Anne spanked him, which surprised even Peter, who was convinced that everyone thought that Fudge could do no wrong, but Anne remarks that Fudge should have known better.\n\nWarren Hatcher – The father of Peter and Fudge, and Anne's husband. He works at an unnamed advertising agency, whose major clients in \"Tales\" are with Juicy-O, a fruit drink that the Hatchers find rather unpleasant, and Toddle Bike, a manufacturer of plastic toy tricycles à la the Big Wheel and Green Machine; Fudge is hired for a commercial for the latter product. Although most of Warren's clients are happy with his work and company, he also had his share of failures, such as losing the Juicy-O account. A loving father who wants what is best for his family, he is more firm and conservative in rearing his sons than Anne, particularly with Fudge. For example, when Fudge refused to eat unless he was fed like a dog, Warren was the one to finally lay down the law, that if Fudge didn't eat his food like a human being, he would wear it. Unfortunately, Warren lacks in cooking and cleaning skills, and once, he cooked a disastrous dinner, and Fudge enforced his own 'eat it or wear it' rule against him.\n\nDribble – Peter's pet turtle, which he won at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. Dribble seems to always be annoyed by Fudge, which led Fudge to swallow him whole. Afterwards, Warren gives Peter a dog to try to make up for the loss of Dribble; Peter names his new dog Turtle, in memory of Dribble.\n\nSheila Tubman – Classmate of Peter and Jimmy, who lives with her family in the same apartment building as the Hatchers. Peter is annoyed at the very thought of her, considering her to be a bossy know-it-all who still has cooties. She takes charge of a school project she, Peter, and Jimmy were assigned to work on together, and though the experience was stressful at times for all, their efforts are rewarded with an \"A\". She is sometimes allowed to help babysit Fudge, proclaiming that she learned about babysitting from her older sister, Libby, who takes a babysitting class.\n\nJimmy Fargo – Peter's best friend, at whose birthday party Peter won his pet turtle, Dribble. Peter and Jimmy have a special rock collection in the park and share a dislike for Sheila, which they must put aside when the three of them are assigned to work on a school project together.\n\nChapter 1: The Big Winner\n\nChapter 2: Mr. and Mrs. Juicy O\n\nChapter 3: The Family Dog\n\nChapter 4: My Brother The Bird\n\nChapter 5: The Birthday Bash\n\nChapter 6: Fang Hits Town\n\nChapter 7: The Flying Train Committee\n\nChapter 8: The T.V.

The vehicles are modified with audio/video surveillance technology, and can be remotely monitored and controlled. Those set up to catch car thieves may include GPS tracking. A \"kill switch\" may be installed in the vehicle allowing police to remotely disable the engine and lock all doors remotely, preventing escape. A car set up to catch thieves who steal items from cars may be disabled so that it cannot be started and have specially prepared \"bait property.\"\n\nThe bait car, often filled with valuable items to draw attention to it, is typically parked in a high auto-theft area. In usual cases, the vehicle is simply left unlocked with the keys in the ignition. If the car is set up to catch car thieves, when the car is stolen officers are immediately alerted, and can monitor the vehicle and send commands to control it such as disabling the engine, locking the doors or honking the horn. Live audio/video streaming devices may be installed allowing law enforcement personnel to determine how many suspects are in the car, what they are planning and if they are armed. If the bait car is set up to catch thieves who steal items from cars, it may be monitored by video from a central location. The bait property, such as a tool kit or gym bag, will also be set up so it can be tracked and monitored.\n\nBait cars can be used as part of a honey trap, a form of sting operation, in which criminals not known to the police are lured into exposing themselves. Unlike a sting operation that targets a known or suspected criminal, a honey trap establishes a general lure to attract unknown criminals. Bait cars are not considered entrapment because they merely afford criminals the opportunity to steal the car; entrapment, on the other hand, constitutes law enforcement persuading or encouraging a person to commit a crime that they would not have committed otherwise.\n\nThe largest bait car fleet in North America, which employs the Minneapolis model, is operated by the Integrated Municipal Provincial Auto Crime Team (IMPACT), based in Surrey, British Columbia. Surrey was designated the \"car theft capital of North America\" by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2002. Their bait car program was launched in 2004, and has contributed to a 55% drop in auto theft since then.\n\nIn 2010, the Anti-Vehicle Crime Association of Minnesota presented an award to the Minneapolis Police for its Bait Vehicle Program, which had been running for twelve years at the time. In 2002, the Minneapolis program inspired a similar project in Essex in the United Kingdom.\n\nBait cars (and the stings they are used in) have been featured in numerous documentary and reality television programs, including \"COPS\", \"World's Wildest Police Videos\", and \"Jacked: Auto Theft Task Force\". They were also the exclusive focus of the TruTV television series \"Bait Car\".\n\n"}

The United Opposition demanded, among other things, greater freedom of expression within the Communist Party and less bureaucracy.\n\nThe grouping was proposed by the Group of 15, a small faction around Vladimir Smirnov which claimed that the Soviet Union was no longer a workers' state. They brought together Trotsky's Left Opposition and Zinoviev's New Opposition (also known as the Opposition of 1925), despite them both having many differences with the Group of 15, particularly over the question of whether the Soviet Union was still a workers' state. Many former supporters of the Workers Opposition also joined the United Opposition.\n\nSmirnov's Group of 15 left the United Opposition soon after, over increasing differences between themselves and Kamenev and Zinoviev's supporters. In October 1926, Stalin's supporters voted Trotsky out of the Politburo. Many supporters of Kamenev and Zinoviev's group, as well as most from the Workers Opposition grouping, had left the United Opposition by mid-1927, changing sides under the growing political pressure and espousing their support for Stalin.\n\nIn November 1927, the United Opposition held a demonstration in Red Square, Moscow, along with Vladimir Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya. However, the United Opposition were unable to gain the support of more than a small minority of the Communist Party, and were expelled in December 1927 after the Congress declared United Opposition views to be incompatible with Communist Party membership. Trotsky formed the International Left Opposition with his remaining supporters, and the Group of 15 also continued its opposition to Stalin. Supporters of these groups were soon exiled or imprisoned, and by the end of 1941, nearly all former supporters of the United Opposition, whether or not they had repudiated it, had been executed or assassinated on Stalin's orders.\n\nDespite various attempts at a rapprochement, the International Left Opposition and the Group of 15 were unable to agree on a further platform after 1927.\n\n"}

Studies are often used to understand the problems involved in rendering subjects and to plan the elements to be used in finished works, such as light, color, form, perspective and composition. Studies can have more impact than more-elaborately planned work, due to the fresh insights the artist gains while exploring the subject. The excitement of discovery can give a study vitality. When layers of the work show changes the artist made as more was understood, the viewer shares more of the artist's sense of discovery. Written notes alongside visual images add to the import of the piece as they allow the viewer to share the artist's process of getting to know the subject.\n\nStudies inspired some of the first 20th century conceptual art, where the creative process itself becomes the subject of the piece. Since the process is what is all-important in studies and conceptual art, the viewer may be left with no material object of art.\n\nStudies can be traced back even as long ago as the Italian Renaissance, from which art historians have maintained some of Michelangelo's studies. One in particular, his study for the Libyan Sibyl on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, is based on a male model, though the finished painting is of a woman.

{"id": "2040476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040476", "title": "Barberini Faun", "text": "Barberini Faun\n\nThe life-size marble statue known as the Barberini Faun, Fauno Barberini or Drunken Satyr is located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany. A Faun is the Roman equivalent of a Greek Satyr. In Greek mythology, satyrs were human-like male woodland spirits with several animal features, often a goat-like tail, hooves, ears, or horns. Satyrs attended Dionysus.\n\nThe sculpture was either carved by an unknown Hellenistic sculptor of the Pergamene school, in the late third or early second century BC or is a Roman copy of high quality, though its present form was given it by a series of restorers in Rome, ending with Vincenzo Pacetti. The statue was found in the 1620s in the moat below the Castel Sant'Angelo, Rome, which in Antiquity had been Hadrian’s Mausoleum. Work on the fortification was undertaken by the Barberini Pope Urban VIII in 1624. The sculpture made its first documented appearance in a receipt for its restoration, 6 June 1628, when it already belonged to the Pope's nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini. When discovered, the statue was heavily damaged; the right leg, parts of both hands, and parts of the head were missing. The historian Procopius recorded that during the siege of Rome in 537 the defenders had hurled down upon the Goths the statues adorning Hadrian's Mausoleum, and Johann Winckelmann speculated that the place of discovery and the statue's condition suggested that it had been such a projectile. \nIt was traditionally asserted that Cardinal Maffeo Barberini commissioned Gian Lorenzo Bernini to restore the statue, \"but there is no evidence for the tradition that Bernini was in any way involved with the statue,\" Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny observed in 1981, after reviewing the documentation and literature. Restorations, at first in stucco, were remade in 1679 by Giuseppe Giorgetti and Lorenzo Ottoni, who enabled the antique left leg to be reaffixed and provided the elaborate supporting structure that is illustrated in Paolo Alessandro Maffei's \"Raccolta di statue\" (1704); in the eighteenth century the right leg was again restored in marble, and once more by Pacetti in 1799. (The sculpture is shown today without the restored hanging left arm.) \n\nThese restorations of the \"Barberini Faun\" may have enhanced the sexual aspect of the statue. Because of this, the statue has acquired a reputation as an example of erotic art. Nudity in Greek art was nothing new; however, the blatant sexuality of this work makes it most interesting to twentieth-century eyes. His wantonly spread legs focus attention on his genitals. Not all viewers have found the \"Faun\" so indecorous: the \"Barberini Faun\" was reproduced on a Nymphenburg porcelain service in the 1830s.\n\nThe statue was housed in the Palazzo Barberini, Rome, until it was sold in 1799 to the sculptor and restorer Vincenzo Pacetti; Pacetti offered it to various English and French clients, including Lucien Bonaparte. The Barberini brought suit to annul the sale and eventually sold the \"Faun\", after much public competition and a ban on its exportation, strongly supported by the antiquarian Carlo Fea and by Antonio Canova— to Ludwig, Crown Prince of Bavaria. Ludwig had planned a special room in the Glyptothek designed by the architect Leo von Klenze before the purchase was even finalized, and it was in place by 1827. The Glyptothek opened in 1830 to house Ludwig's sculpture collection.\n\nA marble copy was sculpted by Edmé Bouchardon at the French Academy in Rome in 1726 (\"illustration, right\"). Cardinal Barberini desired a plaster cast of it to keep with the antique original. Bouchardon's \"Barberini Faun\" arrived in France in 1732, greatly admired. In 1775 the duc de Chartres bought it for his elaborate garden plan at Parc Monceau. It is now in the Louvre Museum.\n\nA copy by sculptor Eugène-Louis Lequesne was given to France in 1846. It is now located in the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts.\n\nA gilded copy is included among many other replicas of classical sculptures that adorn the grand cascade that descends from the back of Peter the Great's summer palace, Peterhof, outside of St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\n\n"}

When he was playing for Palmeiras where he became a national star, in Brazil. He conquered for the Parque Antárctica club a Libertadores da América cup title, in 1999, a Rio-São Paulo cup title in 2000 and a Copa do Brasil title and a Mercosul cup title in 1998. He left Palmeiras and signed with Flamengo, of Rio de Janeiro in 2000.\n\nIn 2000, he returned to Palmeiras for a few months and then signed with Cruzeiro, where he stayed until 2002, when he returned to Palmeiras. After another great season, Alex was sold to Parma, of Italy. There he had a hard time with coach Cesare Prandelli, and eventually returned to Cruzeiro, after playing only friendly matches for the Italian team. Made team captain and wearing jersey number 10, he led his team (which also had other remarkable players, such as Deivid, Edu Dracena, Luisão, Maicon, Aristizábal, Zinho, Felipe Melo, Gomes and Cris) to winning the Brazilian triple crown (that is the State Championship, the Brasileirão and the Brazilian Cup). Cruzeiro won the Brazilian League (Brasileirão) with a record breaking 100 points, 13 ahead of the second place, Santos, with more than 100 goals scored in 48 games.\n\nAlex was then sold by Cruzeiro in 2004 for 5 million euro to Fenerbahçe. He became Fenerbahçe captain after the team's captain Ümit Özat's transfer to Köln and vice-captains Tuncay's transfer to Middlesbrough and Rüştü Reçber's transfer to rival Beşiktaş. Alex scored his 100th goal in the Süper Lig for Fenerbahçe on 13 November 2010 against Gaziantepspor when they lost 2–1. At 33 years of age Alex scored a hat-trick against Bucaspor in the first 35 minutes of the game. Fenerbahçe won the match 5–2. His first goal in this game was Fenerbahçe's 3000th goal in the Süper Lig, so his kit and shoes used in the Bucaspor match are now shown in the club's museum. On 9 February 2011, he signed another two-year contract with Fenerbahçe.\n\nOn 15 May 2011, he scored five goals, including three penalties and a free-kick, in a 6–0 win against Ankaragücü.\n\nAfter Fenerbahçe's league title for the year 2010–11, Alex won the golden boot award with 28 goals for the season, nine more than second place Burak Yılmaz. He made his 900th career appearance on 12 September 2011 in the opening match of the Super Lig season, a 1–0 victory against Orduspor. In the Turkish Cup final on 16 May 2012 against Bursaspor, Alex netted Fenerbahçe's fourth and final goal of a 4–0 victory and was named the game's \"Man of the Match\".\n\nOn 15 September 2012, while Alex was still under contract with Fenerbahçe, a fan-funded statue of the player was unveiled in Kadıköy Yoğurtçu park. Alex's last goal for Fenerbahçe came on 20 September in the Europa League, scoring Fenerbahçe's second goal in a 2–2 draw with Marseille. Alex's last appearance for the club came on 29 September, playing the first half of a 2–0 defeat to Kasımpaşa in the Süper Lig. After a rift with coach Aykut Kocaman over the team's system, his contract with Fenerbahçe was terminated on 1 October. With Fenerbahçe he has concluded his impressive career in Turkey with 136 assists and 171 goals in 341 games. He left just five goals shy of matching the club record for league goals with 136 goals, held by former striker Aykut Kocaman.\n\nAfter rarely featured for Fenerbahçe throughout the early part of the 2012–13 campaign, managing just five league appearances through October, Alex joined Brazilian side Coritiba on 18 October 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for his boyhood club on 31 January 2013, playing the full ninety in a 1–0 defeat of J. Malucelli in Campeonato Paranaense play. His first goal for his new club came on 9 February in a 1–1 draw with Arapongas, scoring the equalizing goal three minutes after Wellington Indio's opener in the 47th minute. Alex scored the solitary goal of the game against Londrina on 3 March, starting a run of nine straight matches where the player scored, netting 12 goals. Included in this goal-scoring run was a brace in a 6–0 defeat of Rio Branco on 13 April. Alex finished the Campeonato Paranaense campaign by scoring a brace in Coritiba's 3–1 defeat of Atlético Paranaense on 12 May, securing a 5–3 aggregate win in the final as Coritiba claimed a record 37th state title.\nIn October 2014, Alex announced his retirement from football.

{"id": "2040510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040510", "title": "Kediri Kingdom", "text": "Kediri Kingdom\n\nKediri or Kadiri (also known as Panjalu) was a Hindu Javanese Kingdom based in East Java from 1042 to around 1222. Despite the lack of archaeological remains, the age of Kediri saw much development in classical literature. Mpu Sedah's \"Kakawin Bharatayuddha\", Mpu Panuluh's \"Gatotkacasraya\", and Mpu Dharmaja's \"Smaradhana\" blossomed in this era. The kingdom's capital is believed to have been established in the western part of the Brantas River valley, somewhere near modern Kediri city and surrounding Kediri Regency.\n\nThe name \"Kediri\" or \"Kadiri\" derived from Sanskrit word \"Khadri\" which means Indian Mulberry (\"Morinda citrifolia\"), locally known as \"pacé\" or \"mengkudu\" tree. The bark of morinda produces a brownish-purplish dye for batik-making, while its fruit have medicinal values. Similar named city also known, Kadiri in Andhra Pradesh, India.\n\nThe kingdom was also known as Panjalu as the twin kingdom with Jenggala. During the reign of Jayakatwang that revived the short-lived second dynasty of Kadiri, the kingdom is also known as Gelang-gelang or Gegelang. Other than Kadiri, the kingdom was also often referred to as Daha or Dahana, after its capital. The name \"Daha\" was used in later Majapahit period, as the seat of rival court of Trowulan.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kediri is the successor of Airlangga's Kahuripan kingdom, and thought as the continuation of Isyana Dynasty in Java. In 1045, Airlangga divided his kingdom of Kahuripan into two, Janggala and Panjalu (Kediri), and abdicated in favour of his sons to live as an ascetic. He died four years later.\n\nThe first king of Kediri to leave historical records was Çri Jayawarşa Digjaya Çāstaprabhu (reigned 1104–1115). In his inscription dated 1104, like Airlangga, he claimed himself to be the incarnation or Avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThe second king was Kameçvara. His formal stylised name was \"Çri Maharaja Rake Sirikan çri Kameçvara Sakalabhuwanatustikarana Sarwaniwaryyawiryya Parakrama Digjayottunggadewa\". The \"Lanchana\" (royal seal) of his reign was a skull with a crescent moon called \"chandrakapala\", the symbol of Shiva. During his reign, Mpu Dharmaja wrote \"Smaradhana\", in which the king was adored as the incarnation of Kamajaya, the god of love, and his capital city Dahana was admired throughout the known world. Kameçvara's wife, Çri Kirana, was celebrated as the incarnation of Kamaratih, goddess of love and passion. The tales of this story, known as Panji cycle, spread throughout Southeast Asia as far as Siam.\n\nJayabhaya (reigned 1130–1160) succeeded Kameçwara. His formal stylised name was \"Çri Maharaja çri Dharmmeçwara Madhusudanawataranindita Suhrtsingha Parakrama Digjayottunggadewa\". The \"Lanchana\" (royal seal) of his reign was \"Narasingha\". The name \"Jayabhaya\" was immortalised in Sedah's \"Kakawin Bharatayuddha\", a Javanese version of the \"Mahabharata\", written in 1157. This Kakawin was perfected by his brother, Mpu Panuluh. Mpu Panuluh wrote \"Hariwangsa\" and \"Gatotkacasraya\". Jayabhaya's reign was considered the golden age of Old Javanese literature. The \"Prelambang Joyoboyo\", a prophetic book ascribed to Jayabhaya, is well known among Javanese. It predicted that the archipelago would be ruled by a white race for a long time, then a yellow race for a short time, then be glorious again. The Jayabhaya prophecies mention Ratu Adil, the \"Just Prince\", a recurring popular figure in Javanese folklore. During the reign, Ternate was a vassal state of Kediri.\n\nJayabhaya's successor was Sarwweçwara (reigned 1160–1170), followed by Aryyeçwara (reigned 1170–1180), who used Ganesha as his royal \"Lanchana\". The next monarch was Gandra; his formal stylised name was \"Çri maharaja çri Kroncarryadipa Handabhuwanapalaka Parakramanindita Digjayottunggadewanama çri Gandra\". An inscription (dated 1181) from his reign documents the beginning of the adoption of animal names for important officials, such as \"Kbo Salawah\", \"Menjangan Puguh\", \"Lembu Agra\", \"Gajah Kuning\", and \"Macan Putih\". Among these highly ranked officials mentioned in the inscription, there is a title \"Senapati Sarwwajala\", or \"laksmana\", a title reserved for navy generals, which means that Kediri had a navy during his reign.\n\nFrom 1190 to 1200, King Çrngga ruled Kediri, with the official name \"Çri maharaja çri Sarwweçwara Triwikramawataranindita Çrngga lancana Digwijayottunggadewa\". He used a \"cangkha\" (\"winged shell\") on a crescent moon as his royal seal.\n\nThe last king of Kediri was Kertajaya (1200–1222). His royal seal was Garudamukha, the same as Airlangga's. In 1222 he was forced to surrender his throne to Ken Arok and so lost the sovereignty of his kingdom to the new kingdom of Singhasari. This was the result of his defeat at the battle of Ganter. This event marked the end of Kediri era, and the beginning of the Singhasari era.\n\nAccording to Jiyu and Petak inscriptions, during the end of Majapahit era in the 15th century, there was a brief resurrection of Daha (Kediri) as the centre of political power, which was led by Girindrawardhana in 1478 after he managed to defeat Kertabhumi. But it short lived since descendant of Kertabhumi who became ruler of Demak crushed Daha in 1527.\n\nThe Kediri kingdom existed alongside the Srivijaya empire based in Sumatra throughout 11th to 12th-century, and seems to have maintained trade relations with China and to some extent India. Chinese account identify this kingdom as \"Tsao-wa\" or \"Chao-wa\" (Java), numbers of Chinese records signify that Chinese explorers and traders frequented this kingdom. Relations with India were cultural one, as numbers of Javanese \"rakawi\" (poet or scholar) wrote literatures that been inspired by Hindu mythology, beliefs and epics such as Mahabharata and Ramayana.\n\nIn 11th-century, Srivijayan hegemony in Indonesian archipelago began to decline, marked by Rajendra Chola invasion to Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The Chola king of Coromandel conquered Kedah from Srivijaya. The weakening of Srivijayan hegemony has enabled the formation of regional kingdoms, like Kediri, based on agriculture rather than trade. Later Kediri managed to control the spice trade routes to Maluku.\n\nAccording to a Chinese source in the book of \"Chu-fan-chi\" written around 1225, Chou Ju-kua described that in the Southeast Asian archipelago there were two powerful and rich kingdoms: Srivijaya and Java (Kediri). In Java he found that people adhere two religions: Buddhism and the religion of Brahmin (Hinduism). The people of Java were brave and short tempered, daring to put up a fight. Their favourite pastimes were cockfighting and pigfighting. The currency was made from the mixture of copper, silver, and tin.\n\nThe book of \"Chu-fan-chi\" mentioned that Java was ruled by a maharaja, who ruled several colonies: Pai-hua-yuan (Pacitan), Ma-tung (Medang), Ta-pen (Tumapel, now Malang), Hi-ning (Dieng), Jung-ya-lu (Hujung Galuh, now Surabaya), Tung-ki (Jenggi, West Papua), Ta-kang (Sumba), Huang-ma-chu (Southwest Papua), Ma-li (Bali), Kulun (Gurun, identified as Gorong or Sorong in West Papua or an island in Nusa Tenggara), Tan-jung-wu-lo (Tanjungpura in Borneo), Ti-wu (Timor), Pingya-i (Banggai in Sulawesi), and Wu-nu-ku (Maluku).\n\nRegarding Srivijaya, Chou-Ju-Kua reported that Kien-pi (Kampe, in northern Sumatra) with armed forced rebellion had liberated themselves from Srivijaya, and crowned their own king. The same fate befell some of Srivijaya's colonies on the Malay Peninsula that liberated themselves from Srivijaya domination. However Srivijaya was still the mightiest and wealthiest state in the western part of the archipelago. Srivijaya's colonies were: Pong-fong (Pahang), Tong-ya-nong (Trengganu), Ling-ya-ssi-kia (Langkasuka), Kilan-tan (Kelantan), Fo-lo-an, Ji-lo-t'ing (Jelutong), Ts'ien-mai (?), Pa-t'a (Paka), Tan-ma-ling (Tambralinga, Ligor or Nakhon Si Thammarat), Kia-lo-hi (Grahi, northern part of Malay peninsula), Pa-lin-fong (Palembang), Sin-t'o (Sunda), Lan-wu-li (Lamuri at Aceh), and Si-lan. According to this source, in the early 13th century Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda).\n\nRegarding Sunda, the book details that the port of Sunda (Sunda Kelapa) was excellent and strategically located, and that the pepper from Sunda was among the best quality. The people worked in agriculture; their houses were built on wooden piles (rumah panggung). However the country was infested with robbers and thieves.\n\nCelebrated as an era of blossoming literature, Kediri produced significant contributions in the field of Javanese classic literature. Next to the literary works already mentioned, \"Lubdhaka\" and \"Wrtasancaya\" by Mpu Tanakung, \"Krisnayana\" written by Mpu Triguna, and \"Sumanasantaka\" by Mpu Monaguna are also notable.\n\nThe book of \"Ling-wai-tai-ta\" composed by Chinese author Chou K'u-fei in 1178, gave a glimpse of everyday life in Kediri that cannot be found in any other source material, about the government and people of Kediri. According to Chou K'u-fei, people wore clothes that covered them down to their legs, with a loose hairstyle. Their houses were clean and well arranged with floors made from green or yellow cut stones. Agriculture, animal farming, and trading flourished and gained full attention from government. He reported that silkworm farms to produce silk and cotton clothes had been adopted by Javanese by that time. There was no physical punishment (jail or torture) of criminals. Instead, the people who committed unlawful acts were forced to pay fines in gold, except for thieves and robbers who were executed. In marital customs, the bride's family received some amount of bride price from the groom's family. Instead of developing medical treatment, the Kediri people relied on prayers to Buddha.\n\nOn the 5th month of the year, a water festival was celebrated with people travelling in boats along the river to celebrate. On the 10th month, another festival was held in the mountains. People would gather there to have fun and perform music with instruments such as flutes, drums, and wooden xylophones (an ancient form of gamelan).\n\nThe King wore silk garments, leather shoes and ornate golden jewellery. He wore his hair up high on his head. Every day, he would receive state officials, managers of his kingdom, on a square throne. After an audience, the state official would bow three times to the king. If the king travelled outside the palace, he rode an elephant and was accompanied by 500–700 soldiers and officials while his subjects, the people of Kediri, prostrated themselves as the king passed.\n\nAccording to Chinese sources, the main occupations of the Kediri people revolved around agriculture (rice cultivation), animal farming (cattle, boar, poultry), and the spice trade. Daha, the capital city of Kediri, (suggested to be at the same site as modern Kediri) is located inland, near the fertile Brantas river valley. From the predecessor kingdom of Airlangga's Kahuripan, Kediri inherited irrigation systems, including the Wringin Sapta dam. Kediri economy was partly monetised, with silver coins issued by the royal court.\n\nIn later periods, Kediri economy grew to rely more heavily on trade, especially the spice trade. This resulted from Kediri development of a navy, giving them the opportunity to control the spice trade routes to eastern islands. Kediri collected spices from tributaries in southern Kalimantan and the Maluku Islands. Indians and Southeast Asians then transported the spices to Mediterranean and Chinese markets by way of the Spice Route that linked a chain of ports from the Indian Ocean to southern China.\n\n\n\n\n"}

California voters rejected all eight ballot propositions. Propositions 73, 76, and 77 were initiative constitutional amendments while the others were initiative statutes. The election was believed to have been the most expensive in California history. Lobby groups spent hundreds of millions of dollars on gathering signatures and advertising for this election.\n\nSchwarzenegger called the election to allow voters to decide on propositions regarding teacher tenure requirements (Proposition 74), the use of union dues for political campaign contributions (Proposition 75), state budgetary spending limits (Proposition 76), and redistricting (Proposition 77). Schwarzenegger originally proposed a fifth proposition on the issue of public pension, but dropped that proposition amid criticism that the proposition would eliminate death benefits to widows of police and firefighters who died in the line of duty The four propositions that made it to the ballot eventually came to be known as Governor Schwarzenegger's Reform Agenda. The Governor claimed his agenda would clear the way for correction of the problems he was elected to solve.\n\nAn alliance of public sector unions expended $24 million campaigning against Schwarzenegger's fiscal reform, with the California Teachers Association expending an additional $56 million and going so far as to mortgage its Sacramento headquarters to fund more campaign spending. Schwarzenegger likewise spent nearly $8 million of his own fortune campaigning. The tenor was highly divisive, with Schwarzenegger calling his opponents “stooges” and at one point Warren Beatty leading a bus full of public employees to follow the governor and shout down his events.\n\nAll Governor Schwarzenegger’s other fiscal reform agenda initiatives were defeated by wide margins. It had been the most expensive election in California history. As the results came out in Sacramento a public union boss waived a broom over his head while state employees chanted “sweep, sweep, sweep”. SEIU's use of compulsory fees on nonmembers to fund its campaign was later found illegal by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Knox v.

Minor must consent to abortion unless mentally incapable or in medical emergency. Permits judicial relief if minor's consent to abortion is coerced.\nIncreases length of time required before a teacher may become a permanent employee from two complete consecutive school years to five complete consecutive school years; measure applies to teachers whose probationary period commenced during or after the 2003-2004 fiscal year. Authorizes school boards to dismiss a permanent teaching employee who receives two consecutive unsatisfactory performance evaluations.\n\nProhibits public employee labor organizations from using dues or fees for political contributions unless the employee provides prior consent each year on a specified written form. Prohibition does not apply to dues or fees collected for charitable organizations, health care insurance, or other purposes directly benefiting the public employee. Requires labor organizations to maintain and submit to the California Fair Political Practices Commission records concerning individual employees' and organizations' political contributions; those records are not subject to public disclosure.\n\nChanges state minimum school funding requirements (Proposition 98), permitting suspension of minimum funding, but terminating repayment requirement, and eliminating authority to reduce funding when state revenues decrease. Excludes above-minimum appropriations from schools' funding base. Limits state spending to prior year total plus revenue growth. Shifts excess revenues from schools/tax relief to budget reserve, specified construction, debt repayment. Requires Governor to reduce state appropriations, under specified circumstances, including employee compensation, state contracts. Continues prior year appropriations if new state budget delayed. Prohibits state special funds borrowing. Requires payment of local government mandates.\nAmends state Constitution’s process for redistricting California’s Senate, Assembly, Congressional and Board of Equalization districts. Requires three-member panel of retired judges, selected by legislative leaders, to adopt new redistricting plan if measure passes and again after each national census. Panel must consider legislative, public proposals/comments and hold public hearings. Redistricting plan becomes effective immediately when adopted by judges’ panel and filed with Secretary of State. If voters subsequently reject redistricting plan, process repeats. Specifies time for judicial review of adopted redistricting plan; if plan fails to conform to requirements, court may order new plan.\n\nEstablishes discount prescription drug program, overseen by the Department of Health Services. Enables certain low - and moderate - income California residents to purchase prescription drugs at reduced prices. Imposes $15 application fee, renewable annually.

Authorizes Department to contract with pharmacies to sell prescription drugs at agreed-upon discounts negotiated in advance, and to negotiate rebate agreements with drug manufacturers. Permits outreach programs to increase public awareness. Creates state fund for deposit of rebate payments from drug manufacturers. Allows program to be terminated under specified conditions.\n\nProvides for prescription drug discounts to Californians who qualify based on income-related standards, to be funded through rebates from participating drug manufacturers negotiated by California Department of Health Services. Rebates must be deposited in State Treasury fund, used only to reimburse pharmacies for discounts and to offset administration costs. At least 95% of rebates must go to fund discounts. Prohibits new Medi-Cal contracts with manufacturers not providing the Medicaid best price to this program, except for drugs without therapeutic equivalent. Establishes oversight board. Makes prescription drug profiteering, as defined, unlawful.\nSubjects electric service providers, as defined, to control and regulation by California Public Utilities Commission. Imposes restrictions on electricity customers' ability to switch from private utilities to other electric providers. Provides that registration by electric service providers with Commission constitutes providers' consent to regulation. Requires all retail electric sellers, instead of just private utilities, to increase renewable energy resource procurement by at least 1% each year, with 20% of retail sales procured from renewable energy by 2010, instead of current requirement of 2017.

{"id": "2040520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040520", "title": "Kroni", "text": "Kroni\n\nKroni () is a figure in Ayyavazhi mythology. He is the primordial manifestation of evil, and manifests in various forms of evil, such as Ravana and Duryodhana, in different ages or yugas. In order to counteract and destroy the evil of Kroni's manifestations, Mayon (a Tamil name for Vishnu) incarnates as Avatars such as Rama and Krishna. He seems to be more evil than the demon Kali of the Mahabharata and Kalki Purana sharing similarities with Lucifer.\n\nAccording to the Akilathirattu Ammanai, the Ayyavazhi holy book, Kroni was born in the first of the Eight Yukams (Yuga (Sanskrit); Aeons ((English)) with multitudinous limbs each the size of a mountain, and was the first evil to be born in the Universe. He had a fire of ravenous hunger in his stomach, and he drank all the waters of the sea to quell it. When the water was insufficient, he then swallowed Kailayam (Kailash), the abode of Shiva, and then proceeded to devour the entire Universe. Mayon, residing with Shiva in Kailayam, escaped promptly and undertook a Tavam (Tapas (Sanskrit); Penance (English)) to receive a boon from Shiva in order to destroy Kroni. Shiva granted the boon, but made Mayon aware of the necessity of appearing in different forms for the successive six yukams in order to destroy the six fragments of Kroni. Being aware of the mission, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments and saved the Universe and with that event the first Yukam came to an end.\n\nThe six fragments of Kroni were then born as evil spirits (or Asuras) in six successive Yukams (aeons). In all the yukams Mayon had to incarnate in the world to destroy the evils. The six fragments were known as\n\n\nKroni, the spirit of Kali Yuga, is said to be omnipresent in the present age, and this is one of the reasons why followers of Ayya Vazhi, like other Hindus, believe that the current yuga, Kali Yuga, is so degraded.\n\nPhilosophically, Kroni is viewed as the evil which prevents the soul from attaining absolute bliss or knowledge. The six fragments are considered to be six evils found in the six chakras except Sahasrara of the physical human body. It is stated that every human being should overcome the qualities of the six fragments (ill effects) in order to attain divinity (Sahasrara), the state of union with God.\n\nBut this view is often criticised by some followers because the Akilam did not mention Kroni in direct relation to Chakras. As some believe that many philosophical concepts are symbolised indirectly as mythical figures in a story form in Akilam, this view on Kroni is accepted during religious studies.\n\n\n"}

Nanda was a Kshatriya and a King. He is popularly known as the foster-father of Krishna.\n\nNanda was the Chief or Mandaladhish of Gokul Mandal that was one of the most powerful Divisional area of Yadava. Nanda was brother (cousin) of King Vasudeva. Vasudeva, took his new-born son Krishna to Nanda on the night of the child's birth so that Nanda could raise him. Nanda, who was married to Yasoda, brought up both Krishna and Balarama. Krishna derives his name \"Nandanandana\" (meaning son of Nanda) from him.\n\nNandagopa was the foster father of Lord Sri Krishna. He took care of Balrama. Nanda, also identified as King Nanda in many scriptures was a kinsman and great friend of King Vasudeva. The fact that King Nanda and King Vasudeva were brothers is confirmed both by Bhagavat Purana, Book 10, and Mahabharata.\n\nAccording to \"Bhagavata Purana\", King Nanda of Gokul Kingdom was brother of King Vasudeva.\n\nKing Vasudeva married Devaki, the daughter of King Ugrasena of Mathura. Devaki's brother, an evil tyrant named Kamsa, had imprisoned Ugrasena and usurped the throne. Owing to the divine prediction that Kamsa would be slain by the eighth child of devaki, Kamsa arranged that all of Devaki's sons should die at birth. Six children thus perished. Vasudeva wife give birth to Balrama and Krishna himself was placed by Vasudeva into the hands of Nanda. Both Krishna and Balrama were brought up by Nanda, the cowherd chief and his wife Yashoda.\n\nNandagaon is one of the religious places near Barsana in Braj. It was capital of feudal Nanda Baba, where he resided with his followers and the cowherds.\n\nThe residence of Nanda, known as \"Nanda Bhawan\", where Krishna grew up and spent first three years of his childhood is main and most famous temple in Mahavan. This yellow coloured building having lots of wall paintings depicting pastimes of Krishna has 84 pillars inside. It is believed that there are 84,00,000 species in this material world and each pillar is said to symbolise 100,000 species, thus representing all the life in the universe.\n\nNanda Ghata is situated on the bank of sacred river Yamuna. The Ghata (River bank) is related to the rescue of Nanda Baba's abduction by the followers of God Baruna, while Nanda was taking bath in holy river Yamuna.\n\n\n"}

It had 16 series, followed by several one-off episodes. Fortune died in December 2013, three and a half years after the last episode was broadcast.\n\nRory Bremner's first television series started in 1986 on BBC Two, which ran for seven series. The BBC gave him his own television series after successful shows at the Edinburgh festival. The series also had input from Jeremy Hardy, Steve Nallon, Steve Brown and Enn Reitel. In 1989 John Bird started to collaborate on the show with John Fortune following suit in 1991. From the fourth series it was renamed \"The Rory Bremner Show\".\n\nIn 1993 the series moved to Channel 4, and over the six series the show developed into a more hard-edged, satirical and political show whilst satirical sketches of \"The Jerry Springer Show\", Ainsley Harriott and sporting personnel were reduced.\n\nBy 1999 all non-political sketches were dropped from the show and series was refocused purely on political satire, with a name change.\n\nIn 2002 three members of the show's production team, Geoff Atkinson, Steve Connelly and Tristam Shapeero, were nominated for a BAFTA for Best Comedy Programme or Series. Bird and Fortune were nominated for a BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance in 2001 and Best Comedy Performance in 2002. They did not win, however.\n\nIn 2003 the episode \"At Her Majesty's Pleasure\" won a Broadcasting Press Guild Award for Best Entertainment.\n\nIn October 2004, the show's stars published a book based on the show, called \"You Are Here: A Dossier\" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 288 pages, , also available as a paperback from Orion mass market paperback, ). In 2004 Rory Bremner was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance.\n\nIn November 2008 a four-part miniseries was produced called \"Silly Money\". The trio looked at the economic downturn, with fewer of the usual sketches and co-stars. The episodes contained many more George Parr sketches than usual. They also included a number of archive clips to further illustrate points and create satire from them based on hindsight.\n\nThe last full series was broadcast in late 2008. Two further series, both having three episodes, focussed more on specific issues. \"The Last Show Before The Recovery\", started on 7 June 2009 and looked at the banking crisis, and \"The Daily Wind-Up\", aired from 2–4 May 2010, and focused on the 2010 United Kingdom general election.\n\nFor most of its run, the show was almost entirely political, but in the later series different genres of sketches were introduced. The programme featured regular stand-up impressionism sections by Bremner. Another feature was interviews between Bird and Fortune, one of them normally as George Parr, a man in a government position or a businessman, who ended up exposing the idiocies of his area of expertise. There were also heavily researched, bitingly satirical three-handed historical narratives; the dinner party sketches, featuring Bird, Fortune, Pauline McLynn and Frances Barber; and other small sketches. Each episode ended with a (usually political) musical number.\n\n\nFrom this point onwards renamed Rory Bremner Show\n\n\n60 episodes in total.\n\nA near full list of most episodes can be viewed on the BFI website: http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/32481\n\nFortune died on 31 December 2013, aged 74. His agent Vivienne Clore said he died peacefully with his wife Emma and dog Grizelle at his bedside.\n\n"}

John à Lasco is also famous for his achievement as an auto-didact..\n\nHe became a priest, and in 1495 was secretary to the Polish chancellor Zawisza Kurozwęcki, in which position he acquired both influence and experience. The aged chancellor entrusted the sharp-witted young ecclesiastic with the conduct of several important missions. Twice, in 1495 and again in 1500, he was sent to Rome, and once on a special embassy to Flanders, of which he has left an account. On these occasions he had the opportunity of displaying diplomatic talent of a high order.\n\nOn the accession to the Polish throne in 1501 of Alexander Jagiellon, who had little knowledge of Polish affairs and chiefly resided in Lithuania, Łaski was appointed by the senate the king's secretary, in which capacity he successfully opposed the growing separatist tendencies of the grand-duchy and maintained the influence of Catholicism there.\n\nSo struck was the king by his ability that on the death of the Polish chancellor in 1503 he passed over the vice-chancellor Macics Dzewicki and confided the great seal to Łaski. As chancellor Łaski supported the \"szlachta\", or country-gentlemen, against the lower orders, going so far as to pass an edict excluding henceforth all plebeians from the higher benefices of the church. Nevertheless, he approved himself such an excellent public servant that the new king, Sigismund I, made him one of his chief counsellors.\n\nIn 1511, the chancellor, who ecclesiastically was still only a canon of Kraków, obtained the coveted dignity of archbishop of Gnesen which carried with it the primacy of the Polish church. In the long negotiations with the restive and semi-rebellious Teutonic Order, Łaski rendered Sigismund most important political services, proposing as a solution of the question that Sigismund should be elected grand master, while Łaski should surrender the primacy to the new candidate of the knights, Albert, Duke in Prussia, a solution which would have been far more profitable to Poland than the ultimate settlement of 1525. In 1513, Łaski was sent to the Lateran council, convened by Pope Julius II, to plead the cause of Poland against the knights, where both as an orator and as a diplomatist he brilliantly distinguished himself. This mission was equally profitable to his country and himself, and he succeeded in obtaining from the pope for the archbishops of Gnesen the title of \"legati\" \"nati\".\n\nIn his old age, Łaski's partiality for his nephew, Hieronymus Jaroslaw Łaski, led him to support the candidature of John Zápolya, the protégé of the Turks, for the Hungarian crown so vehemently against the Habsburgs that Clement VII excommunicated him, and the shock of this disgrace was the cause of his sudden death in 1531.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040580", "title": "Pauline Marois", "text": "Pauline Marois\n\nPauline Marois (; born March 29, 1949) is a Canadian politician from Quebec, who served as the 30th Premier of Quebec (2012–2014) and was leader of the Parti Québécois (2007–2014). On September 4, 2012, Marois led her party to minority victory in the Quebec general election, thus becoming the first female premier in the province's history. However, her party was defeated 19 months later in the 2014 Quebec general election, an election that she herself had called. Marois was personally defeated in the riding of Charlevoix–Côte-de-Beaupré and announced her resignation as PQ leader. Her electoral defeat marked the shortest stay of any Quebec provincial government since the Canadian Confederation and the lowest showing for the PQ since its first general election in 1970.\n\nBorn in a working-class family, Marois studied social work at Université Laval, married businessman Claude Blanchet and became an activist in grassroots organizations and in the Parti Québécois (a social democratic party advocating Quebec's independence). After accepting political jobs in ministerial offices, she was first elected as a member of the National Assembly in 1981. At age 32, she was appointed to the cabinet for the first time as a junior minister in the René Lévesque government.\n\nAfter being defeated as a PQ candidate in La Peltrie in the 1985 general election and in a by-election in 1988, she was elected as the member of the Quebec National Assembly for Taillon in the 1989 general election. With the return of the PQ to government in 1994, premiers Parizeau, Bouchard and Landry appointed Marois to senior positions in the Quebec cabinet. She was instrumental in crafting policies to end confessional school boards in the public education system, she restructured the tuition system in post-secondary education, implemented a subsidized daycare program, instituted pharmacare and parental-leave plans and slashed the Quebec deficit under Premier Bouchard's \"deficit zero\" agenda. In 2001, Premier Landry appointed her Deputy Premier of Quebec, becoming the third woman after Lise Bacon and Monique Gagnon-Tremblay to assume the second-highest role in the provincial government.\n\nFollowing two failed leadership runs in 1985 and 2005, Marois briefly left political life in 2006. A year later, she stood unopposed to become the seventh leader of the Parti Québécois on June 26, 2007. From 2008 to 2012, she served as Leader of the Official Opposition of the National Assembly of Quebec. In spite of internal strife in 2011 and early 2012, where she survived several challenges to her leadership from prominent members of her caucus – earning her the nickname \"Dame de béton\", \"Concrete Lady\" – she led the Parti Québécois to victory with a minority government in the 2012 Quebec general election and would serve as Premier until her government's subsequent electoral defeat in 2014. Her electoral defeat was despite calling an early election for April 7, 2014 in a purported gamble to obtain a majority government. Ultimately, her party lost with the Liberal party gaining a majority government, and Marois, herself, losing her own riding. Her defeat marked the shortest stay of any Quebec provincial government since Canadian Confederation.\n\nAs Premier, Marois closed down Quebec's only nuclear reactor, ended asbestos production in Quebec, and pacified the province's turbulent campuses. Her government's highest profile initiative was the proposal of a controversial Quebec Charter of Values which would have banned the province's 600 000 government employees from wearing religious symbols including turbans, Islamic veils and Jewish kippahs. However, the crucifix (notably, the one hung by above the Speaker's chair in the provincial legislature) would not have been banned under the Quebec Charter of Values.\n\nMarois was born at Saint-François d'Assise Hospital in Limoilou, a working-class neighborhood of Quebec City. A daughter of Marie-Paule (born Gingras) and Grégoire Marois, a heavy machinery mechanic, she is the oldest of five children. She was raised in a small two-story brick house built by her father in Saint-Étienne-de-Lauzon, a village now amalgamated with the city of Lévis, facing the provincial capital on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River.\n\nAccording to Marois, her parents were nationalists and devout Catholics, but remained rather uninvolved politically. Her mother's efforts to have the family recite the Holy Rosary at night generally lasted for two or three days. Marois has recalled that her father was sympathetic to the ideas of the Social Credit and the \"Union Nationale\" party; he kept current with the news and even bought the family a television set in the early 1950s.\n\nDuring her youth, Marois recalls in her autobiography, published in 2008, her parents had \"profound intuitions\", and although her father regretted his own lack of status and education, he was ready to sacrifice to get a decent education for his children. Her three brothers, Denis, Robert and Marc, and her sister, Jeannine, would all graduate with university degrees.\n\nShe first attended the small parish school in nearby Saint-Rédempteur, where Marois recalls that she excelled in French, History and Geography, developed an interest for reading and received numerous books as prizes for her academic achievements. At the age of 12, she was enrolled at \"Collège Jésus-Marie de Sillery\", an exclusive, all-girl, Catholic private school attended by the offspring of the local \"bourgeoisie\", an episode she describes as a \"culture shock\", leaving an permanent mark on her outlook and future choices.\n\nAccording to her autobiography, Marois became aware of her lower social status in school and in the affluent houses of Sillery, where she sometimes gave a hand to her mother, who did housecleaning jobs to pay tuition. She was active in school clubs and describes herself as a good student, although she failed her English and Latin classes, momentarily putting her place in school in jeopardy.\n\nIn 1968, she enrolled in the social work undergraduate program at Quebec City's Université Laval. At the time, Marois recalls, she was more interested in the condition of the poor and in international issues than other issues such as the status of the French language or the Quebec independence movement. According to her autobiography, she participated in a study on housing in the city's Lower Town and demonstrated against the Vietnam War.\nThe next year, she married Claude Blanchet, a young man from a nearby village and her high school sweetheart. Despite their differences – Blanchet was a budding entrepreneur who bought his first gas station at the age of 17, while a student in business administration — the young couple began a lifelong relationship.\n\nIn September 1970, she got an internship in Hull, where she helped with the creation of a local chapter of the \"Association coopérative d'économie familiale\" (ACEF) — a consumer advocacy group —, while her husband was hired by Campeau Corporation, a real estate developer part of Power Corporation. At the time, the region was rapidly expanding due to the growth of the federal bureaucracy and the construction of administrative buildings on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River was met with opposition, according to Marois, because it did not take \"into account the needs and the housing conditions of the local population.\"\n\nThis internship, which coincided with the October Crisis and her return to Quebec City to graduate at the spring of 1971, had a profound impact on Marois. \"I arrived in the Outaouais as a French Canadian. I left the region identifying forever as a Quebecer\", she declared in her 2008 autobiography, \"Québécoise!\".\n\nWhile gaining experience with several community organizations including launching CFVO-TV, a community television station in the Outaouais region, she lectured for some time in social work at the Cégep de Hull, and took a job as CEO of a CLSC. She also volunteered with the Parti Québécois, delivering barbecue chicken to election workers on election day in 1973. After moving to Montreal in July, she pursued a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from HEC Montréal, where she took two classes with economist Jacques Parizeau. After graduating, she was hired as the head of the childhood services division at the \"Centre des services sociaux du Montréal Métropolitain\".\n\nIn the fall of 1978, Marois left her public service job to join her former professor's office at the Department of Finance, but she left her press job after 6 months, feeling Parizeau wasn't \"utilizing her to her full potential\", she told the former Premier's biographer, journalist Pierre Duchesne, a future minister in her own 2012 cabinet.\n\nIn November 1979, Lise Payette, the minister responsible for the condition of women, got Marois to join her office as chief of staff. According to René Lévesque's biographer, Pierre Godin, she hesitated before taking the job because she felt she was not feminist enough. \"With me, you'll become one\", Payette answered back.\n\nSeven months pregnant, Marois hesitated before entering politics. After some support, both her husband and René Lévesque convinced her to run for the PQ in the 1981 general election. After winning a contested nomination, she ran in the La Peltrie electoral district and won with a 5,337-vote majority on her Liberal opponent, as one of only eight women being elected that year. Only 11 days after becoming a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec, she gave birth to her second child, Félix, on April 24.\n\nLess than a week later, she joined the René Lévesque government as Minister for the Status of Women, where the 32-year-old replaced her former boss, Lise Payette, who was not running in 1981. She was appointed as vice-chair of the Treasury Board in September 1982 and was promoted to Minister of Labour and Income Security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region at the end of 1983.\n\nMarois played a minor role in the turmoil and infighting that shook the Lévesque cabinet after the election of Brian Mulroney as the new Canadian Prime Minister, in the fall of 1984. She was first approached by Pierre-Marc Johnson, the leader of the \"kangaroo\" faction – favourable to reaching some accommodations with the new Conservative government —, but finally joined the more hardline group – the \"caribou\" —, who oppose the \"affirmation nationale\" agenda and call for the respect of PQ orthodoxy.\n\nOn November 9, 1984, she was one of the 12 signatories of a letter in which half of René Lévesque ministers disavowed the \"beau risque\" strategy advocated by the Premier and called upon him to put sovereignty at the heart of the next election campaign. However, she did not resign from her position as seven of her co-signatories did by the end of the month.\n\nAfter Lévesque's resignation in June 1985, Marois entered the leadership race despite unfavourable polls. Running on a full-employment and sovereignty platform, Marois finished in second place with 19,471 (19.7%) votes, a far cry from the 56,925 (58.7%) cast for the new leader, Pierre Marc Johnson.\n\nAfter being defeated in the 1985 general election by Liberal candidate Lawrence Cannon, she joined the feminist movement and became treasurer of the \"Fédération des femmes du Québec\" and a consultant with the Elizabeth Fry Society, while lecturing at Université du Québec à Hull.\n\nMarois remained in the party's executive until the end of her term, in the spring of 1987. After Johnson left a party in shambles six months later, she decided not to run for party leader mainly for personal reasons. In an interview she gave \"Le Devoir\" in late January 1988, she took shots at the front runner and former colleague, Jacques Parizeau, criticizing his \"unacceptable attitude towards women and his outdated conception of social democracy\".\n\nLess than 10 days later, Parizeau met Marois and convinced her to return to the PQ national executive as the person in charge of the party platform and asked her to run in the Anjou district, left vacant by Johnson's resignation. On June 20, 1988, Marois came second with 44.8%.\n\nMarois ran again as a candidate in the Longueuil-based riding of Taillon, which had once been held by Lévesque. She was elected in September 1989 general election. She entered Parizeau's Shadow Cabinet as the Official opposition critic for industry and trade in 1989 and became Treasury Board and public administration critic in 1991. She was also a PQ representative on the Bélanger-Campeau Commission set up by Premier Robert Bourassa after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord.\n\nRe-elected for a second term in 1994, Marois became one of the most important ministers in the successive PQ governments of Premiers Jacques Parizeau, Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry. In nine years, she dominated over the Quebec political scene. She became the only politician in Quebec history to hold the \"three pillars of government\" — the Finance, Education and Health portfolios.\n\nShe was first appointed as Chair of the Treasury Board and Minister of Family in the Jacques Parizeau government. After the narrow defeat in the 1995 sovereignty referendum, she briefly held the Finance portfolio before being reassigned to head the department of Education by the new Premier Lucien Bouchard.\n\nDuring her tenure as Minister of Education, she proposed lifting the two-decades-long tuition freeze on higher education in Quebec. This proposal was met with fierce resistance from students' federations who initiated the 1996 Quebec student protests. In the end, the PQ government reinstated the tuition freeze, but Marois introduced policies that would charge an out-of-province fee to non-Quebec Canadian students, and a fee for failing CEGEP courses. She also successfully piloted Bill 109, replacing of confessional school boards by language-based ones implementing a bilateral amendment to the Canadian constitution with the Jean Chrétien Liberal government in Ottawa in 1997.\n\nAlthough Marois was widely perceived as a staunch supporter of the centre-right direction of the PQ under Lucien Bouchard who promised \"zero deficit\" to gain winning conditions for a future referendum on Quebec sovereignty, the government's capitulation in the student protests was seen as a political move to ensure student support in the upcoming general election. Historically, students had been a key voting bloc for the PQ.\n\nShe also introduced a 5-dollar-a-day subsidized daycare program in 1997, which proved popular with working families.\n\nIn the Parti Québécois's second term, Marois became Minister of Health between 1998 and 2001. Bernard Landry named her Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance, positions she held for two years. By 2003, she had occupied 15 different ministries and was instrumental in the legacy of the second PQ government (1994–2003).\n\nDuring her years as cabinet minister, Marois' husband, Claude Blanchet, was named president of the Société générale de financement (SGF), the investment arm of the Quebec government. His substantial personal investments in public companies doing business with the government have put Marois into an uncomfortable position as a political figure, especially during the years she was Minister of Finance and vice-premier.\n\nShe quickly started to organize her leadership bid following the PQ electoral defeat of 2003. Her close supporters founded \"Groupe réflexion Québec\", which served as a think tank. Her key organizers were Danielle Rioux, Nicole Léger, Nicolas Girard, Nicole Stafford, Joseph Facal and Pierre Langlois.\n\nMarois announced her candidacy in the election for the leadership of the PQ following the sudden resignation of Landry in June 2005. She won 30.6% of the vote, placing second to André Boisclair.\n\nAlthough many in the PQ saw her as one of the most influential ministers ever to serve in Quebec's history, raising expectations that she would one day lead the party back to victory, Marois retired from the National Assembly in March 2006, stating that after 25 years in elected politics, it was time for her to pursue other interests. She vowed to remain active in the PQ, and reaffirmed her confidence in Boisclair's leadership. She was succeeded as MNA for Taillon by Marie Malavoy.\n\nIn the March 26, 2007, Quebec provincial election, the Parti Québécois was reduced to third place in the National Assembly, behind both the governing Quebec Liberal Party and the opposition Action démocratique du Québec. Following this disappointing result, PQ leader André Boisclair announced his resignation as leader on May 8, 2007. Marois was considered a leading candidate to replace Boisclair, especially following federal Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe's withdrawal from the race.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, Marois announced that she would run again for leader of the PQ for the third time.\n\nNo other candidate stepped forward to contest the election, and Marois was acclaimed leader on June 27, 2007. She led the party from outside the National Assembly until winning the Charlevoix by-election on September 24.\n\nOn August 13, 2007, Marois announced her candidacy for the riding of Charlevoix, after the incumbent, Rosaire Bertrand, retired from politics after 13 years as the MNA. The by-election was held on September 24, 2007. Marois did not compete against a candidate from the minority governing Liberal party, which chose not to present an opposing candidate, but did face Action démocratique du Québec candidate Conrad Harvey, who had been a candidate in the same riding against Bertrand in the 2007 general elections, and won with 58.2% of the popular vote.\n\nMarois's campaign signs displayed her image on a blue-green background along with the slogan \"\"Chez nous, c'est Pauline\"\" in an effort to claim a return to the PQ's nationalist beginnings. This attempt to present a populist image clashed with Marois's affluent lifestyle, epitomized for many voters in the 12,000-square-foot mansion that Marois then occupied on Île-Bizard, and later sold in January 2012 for nearly seven million dollars.\n\nCanadian tradition holds that, in a by-election, a party leader without a seat is allowed to run unopposed by other major parties. Also, the leaders of other parties are expected not to campaign in the riding where the seatless leader is seeking election. This principle was respected by the other Quebec parties during Marois's 2007 campaign. Marois herself, however, broke with tradition when she campaigned for a PQ candidate in a by-election against Liberal party leader Robert Bourassa in 1985, as did also PQ leader René Lévesque.\n\nAs in most by-elections, voter turnout in the riding won by Marois was low, with only 13.18 per cent of the 33,156 Charlevoix voters turning up at the advance poll and an overall turnout of about 58%.\n\nImmediately after being named the new leader of the PQ, Marois conducted a major shuffle of the shadow cabinet. François Gendron was named the new house leader, replacing Diane Lemieux. Lemieux was offered the position of caucus chair by Marois, but refused to indicate her disagreement and furthermore stated her intention to resign her seat in Bourget.\n\nMarois stated that the project of holding a referendum on sovereignty would be put on hold indefinitely, indicating that this would not be her main objective.\n\nIn September 2007, she proposed a strategic plan for helping the forestry sector, which has been hard hit in recent years by the closure of several mills in western and central Quebec. Measures proposed included an increase in protected forest space, an increase of productivity by developing the second and third transformation of wood and incentives to encourage the usage of wood from Quebec for construction projects.\n\nIn November 2007, when Mario Dumont suggested the elimination of school boards and proposed a motion to topple the government in the wake of poor voting turnouts during the school elections on November 4, 2007, the PQ and the Liberals both disagreed, stating that this reflected a lack of judgment by the ADQ leader. Marois nevertheless added that she was open to the idea of structural changes to the school boards.\n\nNot long after the re-election of the federal Conservatives to a second minority government, and with the global financial crisis increasingly coming to the foreground of current events, Jean Charest precipitated the fall of his own minority government, arguing before the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec that the National Assembly was no longer functional. Obtaining the right to dissolve the parliament, an election was called in Quebec.\n\nThe PQ campaign was largely seen as lacking momentum until Marois’ performance in the televised debate against Charest and Mario Dumont brought new enthusiasm to the party. Benefiting from the collapse the Action démocratique du Québec, Marois increased the PQ representation in the National Assembly by 15 seats and increased her party's share of the popular vote by almost 7 points to 35.2% in the 2008. While the PQ did not win the election or prevent the Liberals from obtaining a majority, their return to the status of official opposition, the unexpectedly large number of seats obtained (51), and the ADQ's effective marginalization were seen as a moral victory by supporters. Marois thus became the first elected woman Leader of the Official Opposition in Quebec.\n\nMarois and her caucus aggressively pursued the Liberal government over allegations surfacing in the media of corruption, collusion and illegal political financing related to provincial and municipal contracts; at one point her caucus donned white scarves to demand an inquiry, forcing the government to set up a public inquiry in the fall of 2011, the Charbonneau Commission. This commission has revealed a pattern of illegal payments dating back several decades and involving all political parties.\n\nIn another scandal, after weeks of pointed questioning by PQ critic Nicolas Girard, Family minister Tony Tomassi resigned in May 2010 over allegations of improperly receiving and using a private company credit card to pay for expenses in exchanges for daycare licences.\n\nOn the French language, Marois resisted restricting admission to English-language CEGEPs, but endorsed such a measure before a leadership confidence ballot. (She later withdrew the promise after she became premier.)\n\nBut soon after winning a confidence vote of 93.6% of the delegates at the April 2011 party convention, two crises shook the PQ leader. Two weeks after her confidence vote, the Bloc Québécois lost all but four of its seats in the House of Commons of Canada in the May 2 federal election, soon followed by a confidence crisis caused by a private bill introduced by Marois loyalist Agnès Maltais facilitating the construction of a publicly funded multipurpose amphitheatre to replace the aging Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City. Marois` insistence on maintaining the party line caused a revolt. Marois had previously resisted popular initiative referendums, but supported them to retain her leadership during this crisis (but not after she won power.) One result was the resignation of four heavyweights in her caucus: Louise Beaudoin, Pierre Curzi, Lisette Lapointe and Jean-Martin Aussant.\n\nOn September 4, 2012, Marois won the election and was elected in the riding of Charlevoix-Côte-De-Beaupré. She became Quebec's first woman Premier at a swearing-in ceremony on September 17. She is the sixth woman to serve as the premier of a Canadian province.\n\nHer party won 54 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, as a minority government. Marois plans to abolish the increase in student tuition fees which had paralyzed the previous government for 8 months. She also wants to abolish Hydro Quebec's 3.9% increase in electricity rates, the 200-dollar medical fee for all individuals living in Quebec, and the increase in daycare centre fees.\n\nWhile Marois was giving her victory speech, a man named as Richard Henry Bain attempted to enter from the side door of the Métropolis. A technician at the venue, Denis Blanchette, 48, attempted to prevent him from entering and was shot and killed by Richard Bain. Another technician was injured from the bullet that ricocheted off Blanchette. Richard Henry Bain, from Mont-Tremblant, had a semi-automatic rifle, type CZ-858 and a pistol. Bain's rifle became jammed, preventing further violence.\n\nFollowing the shots fired, two Quebec Security guards took Marois away from centre stage to the immediate hallway, and away from television cameras. A few minutes later, Marois returned to calm down the crowd and ask them to leave quietly.\n\nOn September 10, 2012, a civic funeral was held for Denis Blanchette where Marois attended along with other important political leaders from Quebec.\n\nHeading the third minority government in the history of Quebec – and the second in the last decade – Marois took two weeks to craft her cabinet, naming 25 ministers on September 19. At its first meeting, the new Marois government was quick to honour campaign commitments and cancelled a slew of decisions of the outgoing Charest administration. The Marois government suspended most sections of Bill 78, an emergency bill aimed at stopping the 2012 Quebec student protests, cancelled a loan guarantee to restart the Jeffrey asbestos mine in Thetford Mines and abandoned the Gentilly-2 Nuclear Generating Station refurbishment project.\n\nAs Premier, she laid out an agenda designed to promote \"sovereigntist governance\" in relations with the rest of Canada, to return Quebec to balanced budgets through higher taxes and debt reduction, to increase the use of French in public services, and to address resource development in Northern Quebec. Many aspects of these policies – such as restrictions on the use of English and on access to higher Education in English – occurred at a time when the use of French in commerce, education, and the workforce is increasing in Quebecand are widely viewed as an affront to immigrants and to citizens whose mother tongue is not French. Such measures have also been questioned by native speakers of French, who recognize the benefits of a knowledge of other languages, including English, and the fact that the knowledge of other languages will not cause them to abandon French as their primary language.\n\nMarois then called the National Assembly into session at the end of October. Soon after, her Democratic Reform minister, Bernard Drainville, introduced Bills 1 and 2 to strengthen rules on contracts and banish unreputable government contractors from doing business with the Quebec government and affiliated entities. The second one establishes a new political financing framework financed almost entirely on public funding. The bill also limits political contributions to provincial parties at C$100 a year ($200 in election years). The new system finances from the cancellation of the political donations tax credit.\n\nFinance and Economy minister Nicolas Marceau introduced his 2013–2014 budget in the fall. The budget laid out revenues, without specifying expenditures. These were presented later, after the budget had passed. The budget projects a break-even operating balance by the end of fiscal year 2013/14 mainly by slowing down the rate of growth of public spending. The budget implemented higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol and modifies – but didn't cancel outright – the $200 health tax passed in Raymond Bachand's 2010 budget, adding an element of progressiveness to it. The Marceau budget also changed the planned increase to the low-cost heritage pool electricity sold by Hydro-Québec to every Quebecker. Instead of raising the heritage pool price from 2.79 to 3.79¢/kWh from 2014 to 2018 as set by the previous government in 2010, the PQ government chose to let the rate increase with inflation while asking government-owned Hydro-Québec to increase its dividend. The budget narrowly passed on November 30, 2012, in spite of objections by the Liberals and CAQ. Subsequent to passage of the budget, the PQ government announced increased expenditures in the area of subsidized child care, while cutting payments to universities. The latter cuts to university funding included a retroactive cut of $124 million in the 2012–2013 fiscal year, an action criticized by both university rectors and student leaders.\n\nThe 41st Quebec general election pertained to the election of members to the National Assembly of Quebec. The election was announced on March 5 by Lieutenant Governor Pierre Duchesne upon the request of Marois. She ran as leader of the Parti Québécois in the seat of Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré. Her primary opponents in the election were Philippe Couillard of the Quebec Liberal Party, François Legault of the Coalition Avenir Québec, and Françoise David of Québec solidaire.\n\nAt the beginning of the election, polls showed Marois having a lead over Couillard and Legault, with Marois placing at 37% support compared to a 34% support for Philippe Couillard. Contrarily, Marois also was much more favoured by French Quebecers; she held a lead of almost 20%.\n\nFive days before the election, she saw a sudden negative backlash according to an Ipsos-Reid poll, with Liberal support sitting at 37 per cent among decided voters while support for Marois and the PQ went down four points to 28 percent. However, the polls had already turned against the PQ after media magnate Pierre Karl Péladeau joined the party ticket. Péladeau's past history as a union-buster didn't play well in a province that was 40 percent unionized, and didn't seem to mesh with the social democratic PQ. At the same time, his call for a third referendum on sovereignty turned off voters who weren't willing to vote on the issue again. According to \"The Globe and Mail,\" the PQ's polling numbers flatlined after Péladeau entered the campaign and never recovered.\n\nAfter a turbulent campaign which focussed on the prospect of a referendum on sovereignty, Marois' government was defeated in the April 7 election which elected a majority Liberal government and saw the PQ suffer its worst defeat in terms of popular vote since 1970, with approximately 25% of the vote. Her defeat included the surprise loss of her own seat of Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré by 882 votes to Caroline Simard, whom supporters of Marois had widely accused of being a Liberal Party paper candidate. Marois's defeat marked the end of a 20-year hold on the district.\n\nIn her concession speech, Marois resigned as Parti Québécois leader, after thanking her supporters and the people of Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré.\n\nOn October 18, 2007, Marois proposed Bill 195, the Quebec Identity Act, which included a requirement that immigrants must learn French to obtain rights, including a putative Quebec citizenship and the right to run in elections at all levels. The bill also proposed the fundamental values of Quebec should be taken into account in a future constitution, including equality between sexes and the predominance of French.\n\nThe idea was met with criticism amongst various minority groups. The Quebec Liberal Party also dismissed some of the measures as divisive and harmful. House Leader Jean-Marc Fournier also made a parallel between the proposed bill and Jacques Parizeau's \"Money and the ethnic vote\" speech following the 1995 referendum, while Cabinet Minister Benoit Pelletier added that it would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Many current and past members of the Parti Québécois also rejected this proposal, including Bernard Landry.\n\nOutside Quebec, several newspapers described the bill as racist. Don Martin, columnist for the \"National Post\", wrote that the population should try to stop the \"racism\" taking place in Quebec. While the vast majority of Quebec non-francophones were opposed, it was supported by a narrow majority of francophones. However, the Liberals and the ADQ stated that they would defeat Bill 195.\n\nIn April 2008, Marois proposed a major rewrite of Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, in light of concerns of a purported decline of French language in the province—particularly in the Montreal region. Her proposals included more French courses in elementary and secondary schools, a requirement for new arrivals to learn French and for the extension of French language requirements to be applied to small businesses as well as for more power for the Office québécois de la langue française.\n\nCriticism for the Quebec charter of values have come from both academics and members within the party. Paul Bramadat, director of the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society at the University of Victoria, noted that the bill would be recognized as hypocritical by many. Mark Mercer, professor of philosophy at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, described the bill as \"appalling\". Louise Harel, a former interim leader of the PQ, called the policy a \"repli identitaire\", an inward assertion of identity, that would alienate and mobilize immigrant groups against PQ. In reply to the Charter of Values, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Minister Jean-François Lisée, resigned his post with the PQ stating that her conscience would not allow her to defend the campaign. The Montreal Jewish General Hospital criticized the charter of values, pointing at the third of its staff who would have to leave. The PQ, whose leaders have been treated at the Jewish General in the past, later added an exemption to the Charter that would apply strictly to the Hospital. In response, Dr. Rosenberg, director of the hospital replied that it will not apply for exemption, and condemned the charter as racist stating: \"Since the bill is inherently prejudicial, there is no point in taking advantage of any clause that would grant us temporary, short-term relief ...This bill is flawed and contrary to Quebec's spirit of inclusiveness and tolerance.\"\n\nIn June 2013, Marois announced her support of the Quebec Soccer Federation's ban on turbans within the federation. This ban has led to the Quebec Soccer Federation being suspended by the Canadian Soccer Federation, which resulted in Marois suggesting that the CSF has no authority over provincial organizations. Marois's stance has received significant criticism for its use of identity politics. In March 2014, Marois said on Radio Canada that \"there is a risk\" associated with radical Islam in Canada.\n\nIn March 2014, Marois was accused of antisemitism by The Center for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) surrounding the statements made by party member Louise Mailloux. Mailloux had written statements equating the Jewish practice of circumcision to rape and claimed that halal and kosher food prices were kept high to fund religious activities abroad. She wrote that the money went to: “For the Jews, to finance Israel’s colonization in Palestinian territories? And for Muslims, to fund the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamists who want to impose Islam worldwide?” Marois defended Mailloux, denying antisemitism within the party and stated that she had \"very good relations with the leaders of this community and the leaders of all the different communities in Quebec.” CIJA claimed Marois's apology and statements were inadequate and \"meaningless excuses\" with CIJA Quebec vice-president, Luciano Del Negro, stating: \"She alleges a misunderstanding and refuses to basically recognize her views are not only offensive, but anti-Semitic in nature.”\n\nMarois involved herself in international affairs in her first months of office. In mid-October 2012, she participated at the Francophonie Summit in Kinshasa, but declined to meet with host, Democratic Republic of the Congo's President Joseph Kabila, who was reelected in a contested general election in 2011. Marois also expressed her concerns with the withdrawal of Canadian aid agencies and funding of Africa among other places, consistent with her party agenda to increase Quebec's participation in international aid and maintain a \"pacifist army\" in an independent Quebec.\n\nIn December, she visited New York City and a month later attended the World Economic Forum in Davos to meet investors and political leaders, including African Union president Thomas Boni Yayi, Mexico's Finance Secretary Luis Videgaray Caso, European commissioner Michel Barnier, French Economy Minister Pierre Moscovici and the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hannelore Kraft.\n\nShe is married to Claude Blanchet, former head of the Fonds de solidarité FTQ and Quebec's Société générale de financement, and is the mother of four children: Catherine (born June 1979), Félix (born April 1981), François-Christophe (born October 1983) and Jean-Sébastien (born July 1985).\n\nMarois is an atheist.\n\nIn 2019, she received an honorary doctorate from the Université du Québec en Outaouais.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040581", "title": "Percy Fender", "text": "Percy Fender\n\nPercy George Herbert Fender (22 August 1892 – 15 June 1985) was an English cricketer who played 13 Tests and was captain of Surrey between 1921 and 1931. An all-rounder, he was a middle-order batsman who bowled mainly leg spin, and completed the cricketer's double seven times. Noted as a belligerent batsman, in 1920 he hit the fastest recorded first-class century, reaching three figures in 35 minutes which remains a record in 2016. On the basis of his Surrey captaincy, contemporaries judged him the best captain in England.\n\nAs early as 1914 Fender was named one of \"Wisden's\" Cricketers of the Year. After war service in the Royal Flying Corps he re-established himself in the Surrey team and became captain in 1921. His captaincy inspired the team to challenge strongly for the County Championship over the course of several seasons, despite a shortage of effective bowlers. Alongside his forceful though sometimes controversial leadership, Fender was an effective performer with bat and ball, although he lacked support as a bowler. From 1921, he played occasionally in Tests for England but was never particularly successful. Despite press promptings, he was never appointed Test captain, and following a clash with the highly influential Lord Harris in 1924, his England career was effectively ended. Further disagreements between Fender and the Surrey committee over his approach and tactics led the county to replace him as captain in 1932 and to end his career in 1935.\n\nA very recognisable figure, Fender was popular with his team and with supporters. Cartoonists enjoyed caricaturing his distinctive appearance, but he was also well known outside cricket for his presence in society. In addition to his cricket career, Fender worked in the wine trade, had a successful career in journalism, and wrote several well-received books on cricket tours. He worked well into the 1970s, even after going blind. He died in 1985.\n\nFender was the elder son of Percy Robert Fender, the director of a firm of stationers, and Lily, \"née\" Herbert. Born in Balham, Surrey, in 1892, he was encouraged to play cricket by his mother's family who were involved in Brighton club cricket, and from the age of eight he attended cricket matches to watch Sussex when visiting them. First educated at St George's College, Weybridge, then at St Paul's School, London, Fender did not excel academically, but was proficient in many sports.\n\nAt St Paul's, Fender began to attract attention as a cricketer. Awarded his school colours in 1908, he remained in the school team for three years. In 1909, he topped the school's batting averages, scoring a century in one match against Bedford School. In the same game, he was criticised by his schoolmaster for bowling lobs. Fender's success led to his selection for a representing Public Schools XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. His success for St Paul's continued in 1910, but his school career came to an abrupt end following an argument between his father and the High Master of the school. The dispute concerned a cricket match which Fender had played without parental permission, and his father was unhappy that cricket was taking precedence over academic studies. Fender was removed from the school immediately; he still came top of the batting averages for 1910 but although selected, he was not allowed to play at Lord's that summer as he was no longer a schoolboy. Despite his successes, St Paul's cricket masters did not consider him a reliable cricketer; he was criticised for taking too many risks when batting and for experimenting with too many different styles while bowling. Fender's biographer, Richard Streeton, observes that \"Fender's experiments were frowned upon from his earliest days but ... already there was never any shortage of ideas in his cricket thinking.\"\n\nWhile at school, Fender spent his summers with his grandparents in Brighton, which qualified him to play County Cricket for Sussex. When he left school in 1910, he attracted the interest of the club and, after success in both local cricket and second-team matches, he made his first-class debut on 21 July as an amateur in Sussex's County Championship match against Nottinghamshire. He played one other game that season, against Worcestershire, where he was shaken by the pace of two opposing bowlers. In the two games, Fender scored 19 runs and took one wicket.\n\nAfter the 1910 cricket season, Fender worked in a paper mill in Horwich, Lancashire, to experience paper manufacturing—his father's line of business—at first hand. While feeding paper into a machine, his left hand was trapped in the mechanism and injured. Three of his fingers were crushed at the tips; upon healing, they remained stiff and numb for the rest of his life. Fender remained in Horwich at the start of the 1911 cricket season and played several times for Manchester Cricket Club. He was on the verge of selection for Lancashire when he had to return to Brighton. That season he played twice for Sussex; the following year, in his second match for the county, he scored his maiden first-class century, against Oxford University. He followed this by taking five for 42 (five wickets taken and 42 runs conceded) against Surrey. After these successes, Fender played regularly for the remainder of the 1912 season. In total, he scored 606 runs at an average of 24.24, and, bowling medium pace, took 16 wickets at an average of 25.50.\n\nIn 1913, Fender was a regular member of the Sussex county side. In the first two months of the season, he made a considerable impact; in 21 innings with the bat, he scored six fifties and one century. His reputation as an exciting, big-hitting batsman grew quickly, and he was chosen in the representative Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's and The Oval. His performances for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, were unsuccessful, and the failure affected his form for the rest of the season. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" commented that he was not worth his place in the team in these latter months. Even so, he reached 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the first time: 1,163 runs at an average of 23.73. He also took 34 wickets at 35.08.\n\nFender initially wanted to be a barrister, but his family could not afford the costs. By 1914, he was working for the firm of paper manufacturers and stationers of which his father was managing director. Although he permitted Fender to play cricket, his father believed that sport and a business career were incompatible. Fender disagreed, suggesting that the contacts made in county cricket offset the lost working time. To aid his business career, Fender moved to London during the winter of 1913–14. Fender was qualified by his birthplace to play for Surrey, and the county was happy to register him for the County Championship. Fender attended to business matters before and after each day's play, and often combined Surrey's trips to away matches with business meetings. Socially, Fender became a familiar figure in clubs and the theatre. He became friends with the actor Jack Hulbert and developed an interest in musical theatre, for which he provided financial support; he also wrote lyrics for some songs. By the end of the 1914 season, Fender had convinced his father that he could successfully combine cricket and business. His improvement as a cricketer was recognised when was chosen as one of \"Wisden's\" Cricketers of the Year for 1914.\n\nAs a player, Fender quickly made an impact for Surrey. He took a hat-trick in his second game, and scored a century in his fifth, to establish his popularity with the Surrey crowds. During the season Fender scored 820 runs, often very quickly, and took 83 wickets including some through experimenting with leg spin bowling. According to \"Wisden\" his worth was measured by more than figures: \"As a match winning factor he is a far greater force on a side than his records would suggest.\" In a powerful Surrey side he batted aggressively, bowled more frequently than at Sussex—mainly as a support bowler to the main attack—and established a reputation as a slip fielder. A teammate judged that Fender was the \"making\" of the team, and \"Wisden\" commented that \"he always seemed the right man in the right place\". A late replacement in the Gentlemen v Players game at Lord's, Fender was not particularly successful but made a good impression on critics. The season ended prematurely because of the outbreak of war in August 1914. Surrey had established a commanding lead in the County Championship table; as their nearest challengers had no objection, the MCC declared them as county champions.\n\nImmediately following the cancellation of county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the Inns of Court Regiment. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With the help of the cricketer Pelham Warner, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling Zeppelin attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with dysentery, possibly cholera and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing football at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at Caius College, Cambridge, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.\n\nSurrey's official captain for 1920, Cyril Wilkinson, missed much of the 1920 season and was unavailable for the opening matches. As the only amateur in the team who was expected to play regularly, Fender was appointed as captain in Wilkinson's absence. He led the team to victory in his first two matches in charge, and ten of his first twelve games. Wilkinson resumed the leadership at several points during the season, but his return in the final weeks coincided with a poor run of results. He consequently withdrew for two crucial games, and allowed Fender to captain the side. That year Surrey had few effective bowlers; Fender was the leading wicket-taker with 109 wickets in County Championship games. In all first-class matches he took 124 wickets at an average of 21.40 to reach 100 wickets in a season for the first time. Inconsistent with the bat, particularly in the latter half of the season, he scored 841 runs at 20.51. In almost every match Fender contributed, either with bat, ball or in the field. His captaincy was very effective; his flair and willingness to use unconventional tactics were unusual at the time. This was quickly noticed by the public, who appreciated Surrey's entertaining brand of cricket. Several games were won by Surrey after Fender used unorthodox methods to force the pace. In addition, Fender's batting and bowling swayed several games in Surrey's favour. Surrey finished third in the County Championship, but lost their final match, against Middlesex, when victory would have made them champions. Surrey needed 244 to win but Fender's instruction to his batsmen to attempt to score faster had an adverse effect, and he later blamed himself for the defeat. Nevertheless, he was appointed permanent captain for the following season.\n\nAgainst Northamptonshire in one of the last games of the 1920 season, Surrey had passed Northamptonshire's score and were in a dominant position when Fender batted. He was dropped early on but batting in a carefree, aggressive style, reached 100 runs in 35 minutes, as of 2016 still the fastest individual century on record in first-class cricket. In total, he scored 113 not out and shared a partnership of 171 runs in 42 minutes with Alan Peach. Although acknowledged to be a fast innings, Fender's century was not recognised as a record at the time; cricket records were not widely kept or studied, and other innings were believed to have been quicker. Surrey went on to win the match.\n\nChosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had his first success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have influenced his selection for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, J. W. H. T. Douglas became captain. Fender was included in the team, and the press regarded his selection as a formality.\n\nDuring the MCC tour of Australia, England lost every game of the five-match Test series. Fender played infrequently and with little success during the early part of the tour. Douglas rarely used him as a bowler, and for the first Test, he was omitted from the team at the last minute and was twelfth man. He was eventually selected for the third Test; Jack Hearne was unavailable owing to illness, and Fender had recently been successful in a tour game. The tour manager Frederick Toone had suggested that Fender should replace Douglas as captain, an idea which had the support of two of the team's leading professionals, but Douglas refused. Fender made his Test debut on 14 January 1921 but achieved little with bat or ball, partly owing to his lack of match practice in the preceding weeks. He dropped a catch from Charles Kelleway, who went on to score 147 runs. Nevertheless, Fender retained his place in the team for the remainder of the series. In the fourth Test, he took five for 122, and achieved five for 90 in the fifth and final game. He led the English Test bowling averages with 12 wickets at an average of 34.16, and was the only England spin bowler to make the ball turn on the hard Australian pitches, though he was not particularly accurate. With the bat, he scored 59 in the fourth Test and passed 40 in two other innings. In the last game of the tour, against South Australia, Fender took 12 wickets, including seven for 75 in the first innings. In general, he withstood the hot weather better than his teammates, but his weak leg made fielding painful on the hard ground. In all first-class games on the tour, he scored 325 runs at 27.08 and took 32 wickets at 32.71.\n\nAs an amateur, Fender was not paid for the tour, but some of his expenses were paid by the MCC. However, tours at the time often left many amateurs out of pocket. To offset their costs, Fender and his teammate Rockley Wilson wrote for several newspapers and magazines during the tour. Their comments were unpopular in Australia, particularly in the final Test when Wilson criticised the behaviour of the Australian spectators. Fender was barracked several times by the crowds when reports reached Australia of his newspaper columns; occasionally, the crowds chanted \"Please Go Home Fender\", making a play on his initials. Fender made light of this, joining in by conducting the barrackers. In subsequent tours, the MCC forbade cricketers from writing about matches in which they were playing. On his way home, Fender wrote an account of the tour which was published as \"Defending the Ashes\". However, he did not elaborate on his own opinions, and left out any controversy.\n\nThe Australian team joined the MCC cricketers on the journey to England, to play a further five Tests in 1921. Once again, some newspapers suggested Fender should captain the England team, but Douglas was initially retained; as the series progressed, several writers lamented the fact that Fender was overlooked. Fender began the season poorly and was not picked for the first three Tests, all of which were won by Australia. The England selectors tried 30 players in the course of the summer, many of whom critics did not consider to be of suitable quality. Fender began to take wickets consistently in the middle of the season, and scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, so he was chosen for the fourth Test. The game was drawn, affected by rain. Fender scored 44 not out and took two for 30 in the game. The final match was also a rain-ruined draw; Fender retained his place but had little success. He later said that he learned a great deal from Warwick Armstrong's captaincy of the Australians.\n\nFender had greater success for Surrey in 1921. For the second year in succession Surrey played Middlesex in the final game of the season, to decide the County Championship, and again they lost. They finished second in the table, but were hampered by a lack of quality bowling. \"Wisden\" praised Fender's handling of his modest bowling resources, and stated that much of Surrey's success came from his captaincy. Several of Surrey's wins were very close, and came after Fender declared. Fender included a lob bowler, Trevor Molony, in three games; lob bowling had practically died out from first-class cricket, and Molony was the last specialist underarm bowler selected in county cricket. But Molony met with limited success and faded out of cricket. Owing to the lack of alternatives, Fender had to use his own bowling frequently, and often conceded many runs. \"Wisden\" said he was generally effective with the ball and described his fielding as \"dazzling\", but suggested that his best batting came for teams other than Surrey. In all first-class matches Fender completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time; he scored 1,152 runs at 21.33 and took 134 wickets at 26.58. He also took 53 catches to become the first cricketer to pass 50 catches while completing the double; as of 2016, only Peter Walker has also done so.\n\nFender completed the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey finished third in the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. \"Wisden\" described the team's success as \"nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender\". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. \"Wisden\" said: \"Essentially a change bowler [one who bowls while the main bowlers are rested]—the best in England, as he has been aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force\". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. \"Wisden\" praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: \"Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault.\" During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered there was nothing wrong with his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.\n\nFender was chosen in the MCC team to tour South Africa in 1922–23, but despite support from journalists, he was not chosen as captain. Frank Mann led the team; his appointment was criticised in the press, which judged him to lack playing ability and suggested that the selectors favoured those associated with Lord's—Mann was Middlesex captain. Mann appointed Fender his vice-captain on the journey to South Africa, but played every match on the tour to leave Fender with no opportunity to lead the side. England won the Test series 2–1, but Fender had some difficulties playing on the matting pitches used in South Africa, on which the ball bounced and turned in a different fashion from the turf on which cricket was played in England. He began in good batting form, scoring 96 in the first match, and he passed fifty on two other occasions, including an uncharacteristically defensive innings of 60 in the third Test, but his batting faded as the tour progressed. He was generally successful as a bowler, but proved expensive in the Tests. However, his best bowling performance according to his teammates came in the second Test, when he took four for 29 on the first day; all the South Africans found it difficult to bat against him, and he later described it as one of the best bowling spells of his career. He played in all five Tests, scoring 128 runs at an average of 14.22 and taking 10 wickets at 41.80, while in all first-class games, he scored 459 runs at 22.95 and took 58 wickets at 19.58.\n\nIn 1923 Fender enjoyed his best all-round season, scoring 1,427 runs and taking 178 wickets. The former was the second best aggregate of his career, the latter his highest total of wickets. Again, there were no Test matches, but Fender played in two Test trials. He was successful in the first match, taking six for 44 and scoring 49 runs, but his performance was overshadowed by continued controversy over the captaincy; Fender was not asked to captain a side in either match. The press questioned why the selectors ignored Fender's captaincy claims even though, in the view of journalists, he was the most deserving candidate. One writer suggested that Lord's \"resented\" Fender's success, and that politics prevented his appointment. At that time it was usual for amateurs and professionals to enter the field of play from different gates; Fender's habit was to use the same gate as his professionals. This brought a rebuke for Fender from Lord Harris, who said: \"We do not want that sort of thing at Lord's, Fender\". Surrey finished fourth in the Championship, hampered once again by their lack of bowlers; their batsmen frequently made large scores but the team could not bowl out the opposition and many games were drawn. Fender's batting continued to be effective, but he demonstrated a more restrained approach and improved his defence. Again, he had a heavy bowling workload given the lack of support, and \"Wisden\" said that he bowled with \"pronounced spin and variety of device\".\n\nFender's form dipped in 1924 after a good start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite occasional successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey finished third in the Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. Fender was married at the end of the 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the \"Daily Express\".\n\nIn 1925, Fender returned to his best form, completing the double with 1,042 runs and 137 wickets. Surrey finished second in the table and by the end of the season had not lost a Championship match at the Oval for five years. However, they never challenged the champions, Yorkshire, and this proved to be the last time under Fender's leadership that the team finished near the top of the Championship table. In the view of the press, Fender remained a potential England captain for the Ashes series in 1926, but Arthur Carr was chosen. In his survey of England cricket captains, Alan Gibson suggests that Fender and Carr were the only two realistic candidates by that time—other county captains either lacked the skill to play Tests or had already been tried and discarded. When Carr was dropped before the final Test, the journalist Home Gordon reported that a \"certain amateur\"—Gibson suggests this must have been Fender—was waiting by the phone for news that he was to captain England. In the event, Percy Chapman took over for the final match and England regained the Ashes. However, Streeton believes that by this stage, Fender was never likely to be chosen; he played in a Test trial match and for the Gentlemen against the Players, but Greville Stevens was preferred in the England team. In all first-class matches, Fender completed the double again with 1,043 runs and 112 wickets. After the season, he joined a short tour of Jamaica led by Lord Tennyson, playing three first-class matches.\n\nIn the following seasons, Surrey dropped steadily down the Championship table. Fender failed to reach 1,000 runs in 1927, although his average of 31.96 was his best for five seasons; he also took 89 wickets at 25.75. That season, he achieved one of the best bowling performances of his career when he took six wickets in 11 balls against Middlesex, to become the first player in first-class cricket to take six wickets in so few deliveries. This remained a record until 1972 when Pat Pocock took seven wickets in 11 balls. Fender went on to take seven wickets in 19 balls; his final analysis was seven for 10. The following two seasons were his best with the bat; in 1928, he scored 1,376 runs at 37.18, his highest average in a season, and in 1929 he scored 1,625 runs, his highest run aggregate. He was less successful with the ball: in 1928 he took 110 wickets but his bowling average rose to 28, and took 88 wickets at an average of over 30 in 1929. His good form at the start of 1929 led to his recall to the England team, and he played one Test against South Africa. This was his final Test; overall, in 13 Tests, he scored 380 runs at an average of 19.00 and took 29 wickets at 40.86. By that season, Surrey had fallen to tenth in the table.\n\nDuring the MCC tour to Australia in 1928–29, the Australian batsman Donald Bradman made his Test debut. Covering the tour as a journalist, Fender judged that Bradman \"was one of the most curious mixtures of good and bad batting I have ever seen\", but was not convinced by his ability at the time. Bradman came to England with the Australian touring team in 1930, and was extremely successful; during the course of the season, Fender completely changed his mind—not least when Bradman, particularly determined to succeed against Fender following his criticism, scored 252 against Surrey. Fender played fewer matches than in previous seasons, as he was writing on the Tests for a newspaper; in the 1930 season, he scored 700 runs and took 65 wickets. Meanwhile, the Australian victory in the Test series owed much to Bradman, who scored 974 runs in seven innings, breaking several records in the process. His success, and the manner of it, concerned the English authorities, and Fender among others believed that success against Bradman was to be found in adopting new tactics. In his newspaper reports that summer, Fender was critical of Bradman during one spell in the final Test when he batted unconvincingly against fast bowler Harold Larwood on a pitch affected by rain. Fender passed this information on to his Surrey colleague Douglas Jardine, who was later named England captain for the MCC tour of 1932–33. Over the following months, Australian journalists kept Fender informed of developments in batting in that country, information which he passed on to Jardine. Jardine later conceived the strategy of Bodyline, where fast bowlers bowled at the batsmen's leg stump, frequently pitching the ball short and hitting him. The tactic was contentious, and created much ill-feeling between the players. Fender did not cover the tour as a journalist, as his newspaper sent Jack Hobbs instead. However, during the tour Jardine wrote to inform Fender that much of his information had been correct and that he was adapting his tactics accordingly.\nFender later insisted that his role was minor in creating the strategy, but he was close to both Jardine and Arthur Carr, who discussed the plans before the tour began; some writers suggested that the original idea was Fender's.\n\nEarly in 1931 Fender offered to resign as Surrey's captain, to give Jardine more experience of leadership before he assumed the England captaincy, but Surrey declined. Fender scored 916 runs and took 84 wickets that season. However, the Surrey committee were becoming disillusioned with Fender as captain after he had missed matches in 1930 to work as a journalist. Another point of contention was that Fender, against the wishes of the committee, preferred to keep in-form professional players in the team instead of playing amateurs when they were available. There were disagreements over expenses, and the committee disapproved when Fender declared Surrey's innings closed after one ball, to make up time in a rain-affected match. A series of other controversial incidents further antagonised the committee. As a result, Fender was dismissed in January 1932, a move rumoured in the press for some time and which was quickly leaked. The club released a statement which said Fender would only stand down if a suitable replacement could be found, before Jardine was officially appointed in March. It is likely that the uncertainty arose because Jardine took his time in accepting the position. Fender supported Jardine's appointment, and pledged to continue playing under his captaincy.\n\nFender played less frequently in the following seasons, as his appearances were restricted by journalistic and business requirements. He scored over 400 runs in each season between 1932 and 1935 and scored two centuries in that time, both in 1933. With the ball, he took over 60 wickets in each season, although with higher bowling averages than earlier in his career. Having played regularly for the Gentlemen against the Players throughout his career, he made his last appearance in the match in 1934. He continued to be an effective member of the county team, which he occasionally led when the regular captain—initially Jardine, later, Errol Holmes—was absent. Prior to the 1936 season Holmes suggested to Fender that he should play fewer games for Surrey that year. Rather than do so, Fender preferred not to play at all, and he informed the committee that he would no longer represent the county. The committee publicly thanked Fender, but the reasons for the sudden termination of his county career are unclear; rumours suggested that some factions at Surrey wanted Fender out of the club. In the event, Fender played two first-class matches in 1936, captaining MCC teams against Oxford and Cambridge universities; these were his final appearances in first-class cricket. In all first-class matches, he scored 19,034 runs at an average of 26.65, and took 1,894 wickets at 25.05. He continued to play minor cricket for some time, and maintained his association with the sport for many years. His most notable appearance came after the war, when he captained an \"Old England XI\", featuring many former England players, against Surrey in 1946 in a match to celebrate Surrey's centenary.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Fender joined the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of Wing Commander. He worked in southern England with a responsibility for moving men and equipment, and was mentioned in dispatches for his role in preparations for the Allied invasion of Europe. Later, he was posted to various parts of the world in his role in movements.\n\nIn the 1920s, Fender was approached four times to stand for Parliament as a Conservative Party candidate and declined each time. Between 1952 and 1958, he served as a Conservative member on the London County Council for Norwood and later was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of London. In the late 1970s, Fender became blind, and moved in with his daughter, although continuing to run his business. He travelled to Australia in 1977 to attend celebrations that marked 100 years of Test cricket and was the oldest man there. In his final years, he moved into a nursing home and died there on 15 June 1985.\n\nAs a batsman, Fender's approach was aggressive; whatever the circumstances he hit the ball very hard, and his ability to play a variety of strokes made it difficult for captains to place fielders effectively. He batted with his weight mainly on his front foot and used powerful wrist-work to send the ball in different directions while playing the same stroke. Among his favoured shots were the drive, pull and cut. Other than his 35-minute century, he played many innings in which he scored quickly, and the cricket historian Gerald Brodribb has calculated that Fender was among first-class cricket's fastest scorers, with an average rate of 62 runs an hour. He also recorded several notably powerful hits, including one which sent the ball 132 yards. Fender's aggressive approach made him an inconsistent scorer, but Surrey had a strong batting side and his hitting power was more valuable to the team than if he had played in more orthodox fashion. The side's batting strength meant that Fender rarely had to play defensively, although he could do so if the situation demanded.\n\nOriginally a fast-medium bowler—a style to which he sometimes reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. His googly was more of a top spinner and he was adept at using flight and dip, with many of his wickets being bowled or caught behind the wicket. \n\nHe gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he thought it might be effective. To deceive the batsman he varied the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His \"Wisden\" obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a \"fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side\", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and \"The Times\" described him as \"subtle in flight and with artful variations\".\n\nFender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick reactions and could move quickly to catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded him as one of the best slip fielders in England.\n\nThe journalist and cricket writer John Arlott wrote of Fender: \"Unmistakable on the field, lanky, bespectacled, curly-haired, slouching along, hands deep in pockets and wearing a grotesquely long sweater, he was immortalised by cartoonist Tom Webster\". This appearance made him a favourite of cartoonists generally, and Fender enjoyed this fame, particularly the cartoons of Webster who drew Fender in a long sweater before he ever wore one; Fender then adopted them to match his image. Similarly, he continued to wear glasses on the field after discovering that he did not need them.\n\nContemporary critics believed that Fender's handling of a limited bowling side while Surrey captain in the 1920s, and his achievements in taking the county to high positions in the County Championship, made him the best captain in England. Teammates and opponents praised his captaincy skills, and described him as the best they had known. His \"Times\" obituary stated: \"[Fender] was a sharp captain, quick to observe the slightest opportunity of advantage and ready to gamble on his ability to exploit it. His keen eye for weakness in an opponent and ability to extract and employ the best powers of his own players caused him often, and with reason, to be described as the best county captain who never captained England. No more flexible thinker on cricket ever lived.\" Always willing to take risks in order to win, Fender's main objective was to surprise the opposition; legends grew of his successful ploys. Prior to Fender, few county captains displayed tactical imagination; Fender inspired his teams to play forceful, entertaining cricket which made him and his Surrey team very popular. His leadership was often specifically commented on by the press, an unusual occurrence in county cricket reports. In particular, his declarations often were the subject of attention and controversy—he often declared, contrary to orthodox tactics at the time, before his side had built up a big lead or even before they reached the opposition's first innings total. One of his favoured approaches was for the batsmen in the lower middle-order to hit out at the bowling, no matter the state of the match; if successful, the team either quickly consolidated a position of strength or regained the initiative if earlier batsmen had failed. Fender also used non-regular bowlers in an attempt to unsettle batsmen. His innovative approach included the introduction of caps with larger peaks to shade his players' eyes from the sun, and he recruited a baseball coach to improve their throwing.\n\nAlthough often a candidate in the press to captain England, Fender was never chosen to do so. Rumours circulated at the time about the reasons. One suggestion was that he was overlooked because he was Jewish, but Fender said he was not Jewish and in any case did not believe this would have been a problem. Other purported reasons included that he had not been to Oxford or Cambridge, and that he was in the wine trade, which was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman, but in later life Fender dismissed these as potential factors. In fact, not everyone approved of Fender's captaincy. He was sometimes accused of gamesmanship, for example by persuading umpires that conditions were unfit for play until they favoured his team. He occasionally used negative tactics when he was unhappy with the approach of the opposition—in one game where the opposition had not declared, he slowed down play to the extent that one over took 12 minutes to bowl. Opponents recalled other uses of time-wasting tactics, deliberate damaging of the pitch by Surrey players to assist their bowlers, and intimidation of both the opposition and umpires. The cricket writer Martin Williamson suggests that \"in an era where gentlemen played by the rules, Fender was adroit at stretching the Laws to snapping point.\" Fender's attitude towards amateurs also brought him into opposition with others. His disinclination to play amateurs in the Surrey team unless they were talented enough was opposed by the Surrey committee—the Surrey president, H. D. G. Leveson Gower, wished Fender to include friends and contacts whom Fender did not consider worth a place in the team. According to E. W. Swanton: \"While always highly popular with the teams he led, his relations with the Surrey authorities were also apt to be difficult.\" Fender attempted to unite the amateurs and professionals in the team through using one gate to enter the field, and stopped the practice of separate lunches and teas. He planned to end the tradition of using separate changing rooms, until stopped by the professional Hobbs. Fender's proposals shocked senior cricket figures, and caused another clash with the influential Lord Harris; allied to other disagreements between the pair, it may have ended his England career. The deeply conservative cricket establishment may also have resented Fender's unorthodoxy on the cricket pitch. Fender made himself more unacceptable by mocking establishment figures such as Leveson Gower; a teammate later remarked that Fender \"was often his own worst enemy\". Fender also believed that the controversy over his journalism in 1921 counted against him with the MCC committee. According to \"Wisden\", Fender's limited success at Test level \"may have saved the selectors, who were thought never to favour him as a captain of England, an embarrassing problem\". His \"Wisden\" obituary concluded: \"He was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years ... and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation\".\n\nWhile still a cricketer, Fender wrote for several London newspapers and magazines, and also broadcast on the radio. Although remaining in England, he commented on the 1924–25 Ashes series for the \"Sunday Express\" and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains. He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians when he called their sportsmanship into question. He later wrote regularly for the \"Evening News\" and \"The Star\"; to the irritation of other journalists, he became the first man to use a typewriter in the press box.\n\nFender wrote four books on cricket tours: his 1920–21 account \"Defending the Ashes\", an account of the 1928–29 tour which he covered as a journalist, and books about the 1930 and 1934 Australian tours of England. A fifth book, more autobiographical in nature, followed later. \"The Times\" described Fender as \"an astute critic of the game\" whose accounts were \"well-observed and analytical\". \"Wisden\" found his writing outspoken at times, but rated his four tour books as among the best available. In 2012, the cricket journalist Steven Lynch wrote that Fender \"can probably be credited with revolutionising the [cricket] tour book. Previously they were often travelogues, but Fender included serious in-depth analysis of the play, backed up with copious statistics\".\n\nFender worked for his father, including periods spent in France and Belgium, up until the outbreak of war in 1914, but when he returned from active service found the business frustrating. With his father's approval, he left the firm to start his own wine business with his brother Robert. The business thrived, in part owing to Fender's wide range of connections, and he remained chairman and managing director until 1976. For a time, Fender produced his own whiskey brand, which he tried to sell when touring South Africa with the MCC in 1922–23, but competition from the larger distilling companies meant that it was a short-lived success. After the Second World War, he had to rebuild his wine firm, which had suffered from wartime restrictions and hardships, this time assisted by his son. He and Robert also established a paper merchants called Fender Brothers, although he later relinquished his shares in the company. Meanwhile, he maintained his connections with Crescens Robinson and followed his father as chairman of the company from 1943 to 1968.\n\nThe press closely followed Fender's activities in his personal life, reporting his activities at dances, races and shooting. As such, he had a high profile, and was easily recognisable to the general public. In September 1924, he married Ruth Clapham, a well-known figure in society and the daughter of a Manchester jeweller, whom he met in Monte Carlo in 1923. The couple had two children; Ruth died suddenly in 1937 from Bright's disease. Fender remarried in 1962, but his second wife, Susan Gordon, died in 1968.\n\nThese are the books of which Fender was the main author.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040586", "title": "Ken Keltner", "text": "Ken Keltner\n\nKenneth Frederick Keltner (October 31, 1916 – December 12, 1991) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a third baseman in Major League Baseball, most notably as a seven-time All-Star player for the Cleveland Indians with whom he won a World Series championship in 1948. He also played for the Boston Red Sox. Keltner was notable for being one of the best fielding third basemen in the 1940s and for helping to end Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak on July 17, 1941.\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Keltner began his professional baseball career in playing for his hometown team, the Milwaukee Brewers, then a minor league team. He made a rapid ascent through the minor leagues, and in 1938, the Cleveland Indians invited him to their spring training camp. The twenty-one-year-old Keltner made the team and played in 149 games that season, posting a .276 batting average with 26 home runs and 113 runs batted in.\n\nOn August 20, , as part of a publicity stunt by the Come to Cleveland Committee, Indians' catchers Frankie Pytlak and Hank Helf successfully caught baseballs dropped by Keltner from Cleveland's Terminal Tower. The drop broke the 555-foot, 30-year-old record set by Washington Senator catcher Gabby Street at the Washington Monument.\n\nIn 1939, Keltner improved his hitting statistics with a career-high .325 batting average along with 13 home runs and 97 runs batted in. He also embellished his defensive reputation with a .974 fielding percentage, and leading American League third basemen with 40 double plays and 187 putouts, appearing in all 154 games. Keltner earned his first All-Star berth in 1940. In the 1941 All-Star Game, he spearheaded a ninth inning four-run rally as the American League fought back from a 5-3 deficit. Keltner beat the throw to first base for an infield single to start the rally. Three batters later, he scored on a groundout before Ted Williams followed with a two-out, game-ending, three-run home run.\n\nTwo weeks later, in a game against the New York Yankees on July 17, , Keltner became part of baseball history when he made two impressive, backhanded defensive plays against Joe DiMaggio, as the latter attempted to extend his 56-game hitting streak. DiMaggio walked and grounded out in his other two plate appearances, as the record-setting hitting streak came to an end. Keltner joined the United States Navy in and missed an entire season while serving in Hawaii. He returned to play for the Indians in 1946, earning his sixth All-Star selection in the process.\n\nKeltner had a career-season in 1948, placing third in the American League home runs with 31 and posting career-highs with 119 runs batted in, 91 runs, and 89 walks, and placed fifth in the league with a .522 slugging average, helping Cleveland earn a first-ever one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox. The Indians won the game 8-3 behind knuckleballer Gene Bearden, with the help of Keltner's single, double, and 3-run home run over the Green Monster in Fenway Park. The Indians then went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the 1948 World Series.\n\nDue to injuries, Keltner appeared in only 80 games in 1949. A .232 average with eight homers and 30 runs batted in prompted the Indians to release him after the season, replacing him at third base with Al Rosen. He played with the Red Sox in 1950, appearing in only eight games as a third baseman and one as a first baseman (his only major league fielding appearance anywhere other than 1,500 games played at third base). Keltner concluded his major league career at only age 33. He played one more season in the minor leagues with the Sacramento Solons in before retiring as a player.\n\nIn a thirteen-season major league career, Keltner played in 1,526 games, accumulating 1,570 hits in 5,683 at bats for a .276 career batting average along with 163 home runs and 852 runs batted in. Keltner had 69 triples, 308 doubles, accumulated 39 stolen bases and scored 737 runs. He led American League third basemen four times in assists, five times in double plays, twice in fielding percentage and twice in range factor, ending his career with a .965 fielding percentage. At the time of Keltner's retirement, only Willie Kamm and Heinie Groh had higher career fielding percentages among retired major league third basemen. Keltner made 7 All-Star teams in 13 seasons. When he left the Indians, he was in the Top 5 in many of their all-time hitting records.\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Keltner served as a scout for the Indians and the Red Sox. He was inducted into the Wisconsin Sports Hall of Fame in . Keltner was also inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame, the Ohio Baseball Hall of Fame and was named to the 100 Greatest Cleveland Indians in . Keltner was the subject of a brief campaign for the Baseball Hall of Fame. While he was never a popular candidate, his candidacy gave rise to the Keltner List by Baseball historian Bill James - a list of questions designed to guide thinking on the Hall of Fame. James ranked Keltner 35th all-time among third baseman in his Historical Baseball Abstract.\n\nKeltner died in his home state of Wisconsin at age 75 of a heart attack.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040593", "title": "Pat Finucane", "text": "Pat Finucane\n\nPatrick Finucane (21 March 1949 – 12 February 1989), commonly known as Pat Finucane, was an Irish lawyer primarily specialising in criminal defence work, who was well-known for acting for members of the Irish Republican Army. He was killed by loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association acting in collusion with the British government intelligence service MI5. In 2011 British Prime Minister David Cameron met with Pat Finucane's family and admitted the collusion, although no member of the British security services has yet been prosecuted.\n\nFinucane's killing was one of the most controversial during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Finucane came to prominence due to successfully challenging the British government in several important human rights cases during the 1980s. He was shot fourteen times as he sat eating a meal at his Belfast home with his three children and his wife, who was also wounded during the attack. In September 2004, an Ulster Defence Association member, and at the time of the murder a paid informant for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Ken Barrett, pleaded guilty to his murder.\n\nAfter much international pressure, the British government eventually announced that an inquiry would be held. This was one result of an agreement made between the British and Irish governments at Weston Park in 2001. The British government said it would comply with the terms agreed by the two governments at Weston Park. They agreed to appoint an international judge that would review Finucane's case and if evidence of collusion was found, a public inquiry would be recommended. The British government reneged on this promise to Finucane's family after the international judge found evidence of collusion. \"The Daily Telegraph\" quoted an unnamed source who claimed Prime Minister David Cameron said \"[there are] people in buildings all around here who won’t let it happen\".\n\nTwo public investigations concluded that elements of the British security forces colluded in Finucane's murder and there have been high-profile calls for a public inquiry. However, in October 2011, it was announced that a planned public inquiry would be replaced by a less wide-ranging review. This review, led by Desmond Lorenz de Silva, released a report in December 2012 acknowledging that the case entailed \"a wilful and abject failure by successive Governments\". Finucane's family called the De Silva report a \"sham\". In February 2019, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in agreement with the Finucane family, finding unanimously that the UK had failed to uphold article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which among other things obliges signatories to adequately investigate state-caused deaths.\n\nFinucane was born into a prominent republican family on the Falls Road, Belfast. He was the eldest child, with six brothers—John, Liam, Gerard, Seamus, Martin and Dermot–and a sister, Rosaleen. At the start of the Troubles, his family was forced out of their home. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1973. One of his brothers, John, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) member, was killed in a car crash in the Falls Road in 1972. Another brother, Dermot, successfully contested attempts to extradite him to Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland for his part in the killing of a prison officer; he was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze in 1983. A third brother Seamus was the fiancé of Mairead Farrell, one of the IRA trio shot dead by the Special Air Service (SAS) in Gibraltar in March 1988. Seamus was the leader of an IRA unit in west Belfast before his arrest in 1976 with Bobby Sands and seven other IRA men, during an attempt to destroy Balmoral's furniture store in south Belfast. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. Finucane's wife, Geraldine, whom he met at Trinity College, is the daughter of middle-class Protestants; together they had three children. His son John is a Sinn Féin politician who was elected as Lord Mayor of Belfast in May 2019 and was elected MP for North Belfast in December 2019.\n\nPat Finucane's best-known client was the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. He also represented other IRA and Irish National Liberation Army hunger strikers who died during the 1981 Maze prison protest, Brian Gillen, and the widow of Gervaise McKerr, one of three men shot dead by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in a shoot-to-kill incident in 1982. In 1988, he represented Pat McGeown, who was charged in connection with the Corporals killings, and was photographed with McGeown outside Crumlin Road Courthouse.\n\nOn the 12 February 1989, Finucane was shot dead at his home in Fortwilliam Drive, north Belfast, by Ken Barrett and another masked man using a Browning Hi-Power 9mm pistol and a .38 revolver respectively. He was hit 14 times. The two gunmen knocked down the front door with a sledgehammer and entered the kitchen where Finucane had been having a Sunday meal with his family; they immediately opened fire and shot him twice, knocking him to the floor. Then while standing over him, the leading gunman fired 12 bullets into his face at close range.\n\nFinucane's wife Geraldine was slightly wounded in the shooting attack which their three children witnessed as they hid underneath the table. The RUC immediately launched an investigation into the killing. The senior officer heading the CID team was Detective Superintendent Alan Simpson, who set up a major incident room inside the RUC D Division Antrim Road station. Simpson's investigation ran for six weeks and he later stated that from the beginning, there had been a noticeable lack of intelligence coming from the other agencies regarding the killing. Finucane's killing was widely suspected by human rights groups to have been perpetrated in collusion with officers of the RUC and, in 2003, the British Government Stevens Report stated that the killing was indeed carried out with the collusion of police in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters (UDA/UFF) claimed they killed the 39-year-old solicitor because he was a high-ranking officer in the IRA. Police at his inquest said they had no evidence to support this claim. Finucane had represented republicans in many high-profile cases, but he had also represented loyalists. Several members of his family had republican links, but the family strongly denied Finucane was a member of the IRA. Informer Sean O'Callaghan has claimed that he attended an IRA finance meeting alongside Finucane and Gerry Adams in Letterkenny in 1980. However both Finucane and Adams have consistently denied being IRA members.\n\nIn Finucane's case, both the RUC and the Stevens Report found that he was not a member of the IRA. Republicans have strongly criticised the claims made by O'Callaghan in his book 'The Informer' and subsequent newspaper articles. One Republican source says O'Callaghan \"...has been forced to overstate his former importance in the IRA and to make increasingly outlandish accusations against individual republicans.\"\n\nIn 1999 the third inquiry of John Stevens into allegations of collusion between the security forces and Loyalist paramilitaries concluded that there was such collusion in the murders of Finucane and Brian Adam Lambert. As a result of the inquiry, RUC Special Branch agent and loyalist quartermaster William Stobie, a member of the UDA was later charged with supplying one of the pistols used to kill Finucane, but his trial collapsed because he claimed that he had given information about his actions to his Special Branch handlers. The pistol belonged to the UDA, which until August 1992 was a legal organisation under British law. A further suspect, Brian Nelson, was a member of the Army's Force Research Unit. He had provided information about Finucane's whereabouts, and also claimed that he had alerted his handlers about the planned killing.\n\nIn 2000, Amnesty International demanded that the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, open a public inquiry into events surrounding his death. In 2001 as a result of the Weston Park talks, a retired Canadian Judge Peter Cory was appointed by the British and Irish governments to investigate the allegations of collusion by the RUC, British Army and the Gardaí in the killing of Finucane, Robert Hamill and other individuals during the Troubles. Cory reported in April 2004, and recommended public enquiries be established including the case of the Finucane killing. The hard drives of Cory's inquiry were wiped by MI5 in 2002.\n\nIn 2004, a former policeman, Ken Barrett, pleaded guilty to Finucane's murder. His conviction came after a taped confession to the police, lost since 1991, re-surfaced.\n\nIn June 2005, the then Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern told a US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland that “everyone knows” the UK government was involved in the murder of Pat Finucane. On 17 May 2006, the United States House of Representatives then passed a resolution calling on the British government to hold an independent public inquiry into Finucane's killing.\n\nA public inquiry was announced by the British Government in 2007, but Finucane's family criticised its limited remit and announced that they would not co-operate. Amnesty International has reiterated its call for an independent inquiry, and have called on members of the British judiciary not to serve on the inquiry if it is held under the terms of the 2005 Inquiries Act.\n\nFinucane's widow, Geraldine (born 1950), has written letters repeating this request to all the senior judges in Great Britain, and took out a full-page advertisement in the newspaper \"The Times\" to draw attention to the campaign. In June 2007, it was reported that no police or soldiers would be charged in connection with the killing.\n\nOn 11 October 2011, members of the Finucane family met with Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street. Cameron provided them with an official apology for state collusion into Pat Finucane's death. Following the meeting, Finucane's son Michael said that he and the family had been \"genuinely shocked\" to learn that the Cory recommendation of a public enquiry, previously accepted by Tony Blair, would not be followed, and that a review of the Stevens and Cory casefiles would be undertaken instead. Geraldine Finucane described the proposal as \"nothing less than an insult...a shoddy, half-hearted alternative to a proper public inquiry\". The following day, the official apology was given publicly in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson.\n\nOn 12 December 2012, the government released the Pat Finucane Review, the results of the inquiry conducted by Sir Desmond de Silva. The report documented extensive evidence of State collaboration with Loyalist gunmen, including the selection of targets, and concluded that \"there was a wilful and abject failure by successive governments to provide the clear policy and legal framework necessary for agent-handling operations to take place effectively within the law.\"\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron acknowledged \"shocking levels of collusion\" and issued an apology. However, Finucane's family denounced the De Silva report as a \"sham\" and a \"suppression of the truth\" into which they were allowed no input. In May 2013, state documents dated 2011 disclosed through the courts revealed that David Cameron's former director of security and intelligence, Ciarán Martin, had warned him that senior members of Margaret Thatcher's government may have been aware of \"a systemic problem with loyalist agents\" at the time of Pat Finucane's death but had done nothing about it.\n\nIn late 2015, three former RUC officers, Trevor McIlwrath, Johnston Brown and Alan Simpson, filed suit in the High Court in Belfast against the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), alleging that, in order to cover up a conspiracy, the PSNI obstructed their investigation into the murder in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The lawsuit alleged that a senior RUC official told Simpson, who headed the investigation, not to get \"too deeply involved in this one.\" Simpson further alleged that a senior Special Branch official who told Simpson during the investigation that he knew nothing, was revealed by the De Silva report to actually have been privy to significant information.\n\nFinucane's law firm, Madden & Finucane Solicitors, led by Peter Madden, continues to act for those it considers to have been victims of mistreatment by the State, or their survivors. The Pat Finucane Centre (PFC), named in his honour, is a human rights advocacy and lobbying entity in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040595", "title": "Hua Rong", "text": "Hua Rong\n\nHua Rong is a fictional character in \"Water Margin\", one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. Nicknamed \"Little Li Guang\", he ranks ninth among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Hua Rong as handsome-looking with red lips, sparkling white teeth, a narrow waist and broad shoulders. Known to be deadly with his arrows, he is nicknamed \"Little Li Guang\" after the Han dynasty general Li Guang, whose archery skill is legendary. Hua Rong serves as the garrison commander of Qingfeng Fort (清風寨; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong) under Liu Gao, the fort‘s governor.\n\nAfter killing Yan Poxi in anger, Song Jiang flees Yuncheng County, his hometown. He first takes shelter in the house of Chai Jin, but soon moves to Hua Rong‘s following the latter's invitation. Coming near the fort, Song makes friends with the outlaws at Mount Qingfeng (). There he convinces Wang Ying, one of the chiefs, to release a woman he has abducted. The woman turns out to be Liu Gao's wife.\n\nLantern Festival comes round, and Song Jiang, who is then living in Hua Rong‘s house, goes outdoor that night to enjoy the lanterns. Mrs Liu spots him and lies to her husband that Song has abducted and attempted to rape her. Believing his wife, Liu orders Song Jiang be arrested and jailed. As Liu Gao ignores his plea to release Song, Hua Rong breaks into his house and frees his friend. When Liu‘s men come for Song Jiang at Hua Rong‘s house, Hua scares them away with his deadly archery shots.\n\nLiu Gao seeks help from Murong Yanda, the governor of Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong), whose jurisdiction includes the Qingfeng Fort. Murong sends Huang Xin to help Liu deal with the matter. Pretending to be a mediator, Huang Xin lures Hua Rong to a feast where the latter is ambushed and captured. When Huang is escorting Song Jiang and Hua Rong back to Qingzhou, the outlaws from Mount Qingfeng intercept them and save the two. They also kill Liu but Huang gets away.\n\nMurong Yanda sends Qin Ming to lead an army to attack the outlaws. But Qin defects after Murong killed his family including his wife being misled by the outlaws to believe he has changed sides while he originally had not. Qin even convinces his student Huang Xin to join him. With Huang opening the fort, the outlaws get hold of Mrs Liu and kill her. Song Jiang marries Hua Rong's younger sister to Qin Ming as \"compensation\".\n\nExpecting another attack from Qingzhou, the Mount Qingfeng stronghold decides to join Liangshan Marsh. Soon after reaching Liangshan, Hua Rong awes his hosts with his archery skill by shooting down a pinpointed wild goose flying in a flock. Thereafter his accurate shots serve well in many of Liangshan‘s battles. For example, he shoots down a signal lantern used by an enemy at night to indicate the movement of the Liangshan forces. During the battle of Gaotangzhou, he kills an enemy officer with a shot. After the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly, he is appointed as one of the Eight Tiger Cub Vanguard Generals of the Liangshan cavalry.\n\nAfter the Liangshan outlaws received amnesty from Emperor Huizong, Hua Rong participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory. He survives all the expeditions. In recognition of his contributions, Emperor Huizong appoints him as official of a prefecture.\n\nWhen Hua Rong learns that Song Jiang has been poisoned by corrupt officials at the imperial court, he travels to Chuzhou (楚州; in present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu), where Song was buried. There he finds Wu Yong mourning at the grave. Overwhelmed with grief, both hang themselves from a tree next to it.\n\n"}

{"id": "2040605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040605", "title": "John R. Winder", "text": "John R. Winder\n\nJohn Rex Winder (; December 11, 1821 – March 27, 1910) was a leader and general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric from 1887 to 1901, and First Counselor in the First Presidency to church president Joseph F. Smith from 1901 until his death. He was well known for his business abilities, and influenced Heber J. Grant. He was also active in politics and the militia, participating in the Utah War and the Black Hawk War (Utah). When the church came under heavy government pressure for its practice of plural marriage, Winder held the church's assets to keep them from being seized by the federal government. He was a polygamist and had four wives and 20 children.\n\nWinder was born to Richard and Sophia Collins Winder in Biddenden, England. He worked in several trades as a youth, settling into a position as a shoe and leather man in his twenties in London. There he married Ellen Walters in 1845. There also he was recruited to manage a shoe store in Liverpool.\n\nIn the shoe store, he discovered the LDS Church and joined as a member. In February 1853, he and his wife set out to Utah to join the church there. He traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, nearly succumbing to smallpox on the way. He then traveled via steamboat up the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, where he caught another boat leading up to Keokuk, Iowa. From there he traveled with a company of members heading towards Utah Territory under Joseph W. Young. They arrived on October 10, 1853.\n\nEngaged in leather work, Winder was quite successful in several ventures. His business sense became recognized and eventually he found seats on several corporate boards. Of his ventures, one remains today: Winder Dairy. Winder was generous with his wealth: The poor, orphans, and widows benefited greatly from his efforts.\n\nWinder also became a figure in politics and the militia in the territory. He led the Nauvoo Legion to stop the advance of Johnston's Army in the Utah War of 1857. In the Black Hawk War (Utah), he fought as Adjutant General. He was the chief aid to General Daniel H. Wells, and wrote up the expense report submitted to congress at the conclusion of the conflict.\n\nWinder also served as chairman of the People's Party. His efforts to modernize the exercise of politics in the territory led from the church-dominated system to a two-party system much like the national political system. Serving as a delegate to several state constitutional conventions, he was an instrument in Utah Territory achieving statehood.\n\nLDS Church president John Taylor called Winder to serve as Second Counselor to Presiding Bishop William B. Preston on April 8, 1887. During this time, the federal government began to put more pressure on the church for its practice of plural marriage. After the passage of the Edmunds–Tucker Act in 1887, church leaders went into hiding and church assets were distributed to be kept from being seized. Winder assisted many people on the run from the federal government, by helping to hide them or to post bail. His poplar farm on the south of the city served as a temporary church headquarters for Taylor.\n\nIn 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff approached Winder, Charles W. Penrose, and George Reynolds to review and edit the manuscript of the Manifesto. With the publication and announcement of the Manifesto, federal pressure was alleviated.\n\nAnother significant contribution of Winder during his tenure as Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric was his work on the interior of the Salt Lake Temple. He managed the interior work to be done, and completed it much ahead of schedule. That earned him praise from leaders of the church. After the dedication, Winder served as First Assistant to temple president Lorenzo Snow. Winder remained in the presidency of the temple until his death.\n\nWinder was called to the First Presidency as First Counselor to church president Joseph F. Smith on October 17, 1901. One of the notable efforts of that administration was the legal fight to get Reed Smoot seated as a U.S. senator in the Smoot Hearings. In 1909, the First Presidency published a proclamation called \"The Origin of Man\", which clarified the church's position on human evolution and reaffirmed that men are the children of God and were created by him.\n\nHaving never been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles prior to his call to the First Presidency, a situation which is a rarity in the LDS Church, there has been some dispute as to whether or not Winder was ordained an apostle at the time of his appointment to the First Presidency. The LDS Church has no record of Winder being ordained to the priesthood office of apostle.\n\nWinder married Ellen Walters in London in 1845. A practitioner of plural marriage, Winder married Hannah Thompson in Salt Lake City in 1855, Elizabeth Parker in 1857, and later, Maria Burnham in 1893. Through the first three women he fathered 23 children.\n\nMaria Burnham was from Fruitland, New Mexico Territory, where the LDS Church congregation was named the Burnham Ward because of her family's prominence in the early history of the area.\n\nWinder died in Salt Lake City, Utah, of pneumonia. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. Anthon H. Lund succeeded him as First Counselor in the First Presidency.\n\n"}

{"id": "2040622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040622", "title": "Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad", "text": "Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad\n\nThe Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad was the final name of a system of railroads throughout Florida, becoming part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway in 1900. The system, including some of the first railroads in Florida, stretched from Jacksonville west through Tallahassee and south to Tampa. Much of the FC&P network is still in service under the ownership of CSX Transportation.\n\nThe Tallahassee Rail Road was first organized in 1832 as the Leon Railway, changing its name in 1834. It opened in 1837, connecting Tallahassee, Florida to the Gulf of Mexico port of St. Marks, Florida. This was the second steam railroad in Florida, opening just a year after the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad.\n\nThe Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad was chartered January 24, 1851, to build west from Jacksonville, Florida, and construction began in 1857. The Pensacola and Georgia Railroad was chartered in January 1853, to be built east from Pensacola, Florida, but started at Tallahassee. The two lines met at Lake City, Florida in 1860, and the latter also built from Tallahassee west to four miles (6 km) short of Quincy, Florida, stopping in 1863 in the middle of the American Civil War.\n\nIn 1855 the Pensacola and Georgia bought the Tallahassee. In 1869 the two merged to form the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad, which obtained trackage rights over the Florida Central Railroad, the 1868 reorganization of the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf. The railroad eventually was built west to Chattahoochee, Florida, a major junction with the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad continuing west and the Chattahoochee and East Pass Railroad running northeast. In 1882, Sir Edward Reed purchased the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile, absorbing the Florida Central and reorganizing the two as the Florida Central and Western Railroad.\n\nThe Florida Railroad was incorporated January 8, 1853, to build a line across the state, from Fernandina, Florida (north of Jacksonville, Florida) southwest to Cedar Key, Florida. The first train ran in 1861, but the line failed and the company was reorganized in 1866. In 1872 it was reorganized again as the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company. In 1881, Sir Edward Reed purchased the railroad and reorganized it as the Florida Transit Company, which in 1883 was reorganized again as the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad. The Florida Transit and Peninsular operated two subsidiaries, the Peninsula Railroad and Tropical Florida Railroad, organized to build lines respectively from the Florida Transit at Waldo, Florida to Ocala, Florida and beyond to Tampa, Florida.\n\nIn 1884-85, Reed merged the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad with the Florida Central and Western Railroad, Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, and Leesburg and Indian River Railroad as the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, which instantly became the largest railroad system in Florida. The new company was placed in receivership in October 1885, sold at foreclosure and reorganized as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad Company in 1886.\n\nOn May 1, 1889, the company was reorganized again, as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railway, and on January 16, 1893, the final reorganization produced the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, along with a merger of the Florida Northern Railroad (a line from Yulee to Savannah, Georgia). The Seaboard Air Line Railway leased the FC&P on July 1, 1900, and the latter was merged into the former on August 15, 1903. The FC&P tracks from Savannah, Georgia to Tampa, Florida via Jacksonville would become part of Seaboard's main line.\n\nThough various mergers, the Seaboard Air Line would become part of CSX Transportation. Much of the former FC&P network remains in service today.\n\nBy the time the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad reached its greatest extent in 1893, it essentially had two main lines. One of the main lines (the Western Division) extended from Jacksonville west to Tallahassee and Chattahoochee, where it connected to the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad (a subsidiary of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad). The other main line (the Southern Division) was what was previously the Florida Railroad extending from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key. These two main lines intersected at Baldwin Junction just west of Jacksonville. The routes would continue operation after Seaboard acquired the lines in 1900, though Seaboard designated the route to Tampa as the main line south of Waldo instead of the route to Cedar Key. \n\nSeaboard abandoned the former Southern Division from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The line was abandoned between Callahan and Yulee in 1954. The line from Archer to Waldo would be removed in the late 1980s. Today, State Road 24 runs along much of the former right of way of the route between Waldo and Cedar Key. The Waldo Road Greenway also runs along the former right of way between Gainesville and Waldo. South of Baldwin, it is part of CSX's S Line.\n\nFC&P's Southern Division is still active and in service as the following:\n\nThe Western Division remains operates as the following routes:\n\nThe Tampa Division ran from the Fernandina-Cedar Key line at Waldo south to Tampa. This had been chartered as the Peninsula Railroad north of Ocala and the Tropical Florida Railroad south of Ocala. After the Seaboard acquisition, this route became the southernmost segment of their main line. It would subsequently become part of CSX's S Line.\n\nWhile mostly intact, a short 16-mile segment of the S Line has been abandoned between Lacoochee and Zephyrhills, where the line now briefly detours along a former Atlantic Coast Line route (using former South Florida Railroad and Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad trackage). Despite not being part of the original line, this former Atlantic Coast Line segment is considered to be an unofficial part of the S Line since it carries all S Line traffic.\n\nThe Tampa Division now operates as the following routes on the S Line:\n\nThe Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad was organized in 1874 and opened in 1881, connecting Jacksonville north to the Southern Division at Yulee. It was consolidated into the Florida Railway and Navigation Company in 1885.\n\nThe South Bound Railroad was organized in 1887 and completed in 1891, connecting Columbia, South Carolina to Savannah, Georgia. The FC&P leased it in 1893. In 1892 the Florida Northern Railroad was chartered by the FC&P to continue the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad north into Georgia, where the FC&P would continue the line to Savannah. This opened in 1894, forming a continuous line from Jacksonville to Columbia. In 1899 and 1900, the South Bound Railroad was extended north to Camden, South Carolina to meet the Seaboard Air Line Railway's Chesterfield and Kershaw Railroad. The Northern Division became part of the Seaboard main line after the Seaboard acquisition.\n\nIn 1925, the Gross Cutoff was built by Seaboard from the Northern Division near the Florida/Georgia state line southwest to the Southern Division at Callahan.\n\nThe Northern Division remains today in segments. The abandoned segment within Jacksonville is now the S-Line Urban Greenway. \n\nAfter the Seaboard Coast Line became the CSX Corporation in the 1980s, CSX abandoned the S Line between Riceboro, Georgia (just southwest of Savannah) and Bladen, Georgia in 1986. Track between Bladen and Seals was removed in 1990.\n\nThe Northern Division is now the following routes:\n\nThe Leesburg and Indian River Railroad was incorporated in 1884 and merged into the Florida Railway and Navigation Company in 1885. It built a line from the Tampa Division at Wildwood east to Tavares, with plans to continue east to Titusville. That extension was not built, but pieces were built by other companies.\n\nThe Tavares, Orlando and Atlantic Railroad was incorporated in 1883, and built an extension of line from Tavares to Orlando. The FC&P leased it in 1891.\n\nThe Orlando and Winter Park Railway was incorporated in 1886 and extended the line from Orlando to Winter Park. The Osceola and Lake Jesup Railway, incorporated 1888, continued the line past Oviedo to Lake Charm. In 1891 the two companies merged into the East Florida and Atlantic Railroad, which was leased by the FC&P in 1892. In the line's early days, passenger trains served the historic Church Street Station in Orlando, which belonged to the South Florida Railroad. Trains would turn on to the South Florida Railroad (which would become the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the Seaboard Air Line's competitor) in Downtown Orlando just north of the station.\n\nThe line west of Orlando remained intact under Seaboard and its successors until the 1970s when tracks were removed between Leesburg and Tavares. Since 1986, the remaining line from Tavares to Orlando has been operated by the Florida Central Railroad, a short line that was run by the Pinsly Railroad Company from 1986 to 2019 and is now operated by Regional Rail, LLC. The Florida Midland Railroad, another Pinsly-operated short line, operated the segment from Wildwood to Leesburg from 1987 until 2005, when most of that end of the line was abandoned. All that remains on the Wildwood end is a short wye which CSX uses to turn locomotives from Wildwood Yard.\n\nEast of Orlando, the abandoned right of way is now the Cady Way Trail and the southern extension of the Cross Seminole Trail.\n\nThe Monticello Branch ran from the Western Division at Drifton north to Monticello.\n\nThe Fernandina and Amelia Beach Railway was organized in 1883 to run from Fernandina at the end of the Southern Division south to Amelia Beach. The FC&P leased it in 1891, and it was abandoned around 1900.\n\nThe Wannee Branch was originally part of the Atlantic, Suwannee River and Gulf Railway. It branched off the Southern Division at Starke and headed west to Wannee. Construction of the line began in 1863. The line was bought by the FC&P in 1899 and it was completed to Wannee in 1902. The branch remains in service as part of CSX's Brooker Subdivision from Starke to a point just west of LaCrosse. The branch's connection with the main line is still known as Wannee Junction.\n\nThe branch to Early Bird was built in 1890 and branched off the Southern Division in Archer. The line gained more prominence in the Seaboard era. Seaboard extended the branch south through Dunnellon and Hernando to Inverness in 1911. The Brooksville and Inverness Railway, a Seaboard subsidiary, would extend it further south to Brooksville in 1925 to connect with the Tampa Northern Railroad.

It carried the GRAU index 9K714 and was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-23 Spider. The introduction of the Oka significantly strengthened Soviet theatre nuclear capabilities as its range and accuracy allowed it not only to strike hardened NATO targets such as airfields, nuclear delivery systems, and command centers, but moving targets as well. It also had a fast reaction time, being able to fire in approximately five minutes, and was nearly impossible to intercept, thereby allowing it to penetrate defenses.\n\nThe main components of the 9K714 system were:\n\nThe operational life of the Oka was limited and controversial. The Soviet military asserted that the Oka had a maximum range of 250 miles (400 km). American experts, however, estimated it had a greater range. In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev proposed to George Shultz that he would unilaterally remove all Okas, if it would prevent the United States from building up its own short-range nuclear forces in Europe, despite the fact that the Soviet military was in favor of the Oka. Shultz however lacked the authority to act on the suggestion. Gorbachev included the Oka in the class of systems to be discontinued as part of the INF Treaty as a gesture of goodwill, even though Soviet assertions of its maximum range did not put it outside the specifications of the treaty.\n\nThere was diplomatic controversy over this weapons system in April 1990, when the Soviets informed the US of their covert transfer of at least 120 missiles to the Warsaw Pact states of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and East Germany during the time of negotiation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Evidence indicates that the missiles were transferred with conventional warheads only, although equipment to load Soviet nuclear warheads was apparently retained.\n\n\nIn addition to these warheads, the SS-23 was also reported to be able to deliver chemical munitions.\n\n\n\n"}

This name derives from an assumption that the normal progression to the tonic, the ii-V-I turnaround (ii-V to I, see also authentic cadence) is, by inference, the \"front door\", a metaphor suggesting that this is the main route to the tonic.\n\nThe VII chord, a pivot chord borrowed from the parallel minor of the current tonic major key, is a dominant seventh. Therefore, it can resolve to I; it is commonly preceded by IV going to iv, then VII, then I. In C major the dominant would be G: (the notes GBDF), sharing two common tones with B: (the notes BDFA). The notes A and F serve as upper leading-tones back to G and E (when the chord moves to the tonic, C major), respectively, rather than B and F serving as the lower and upper leading-tones to C and E in a conventional G7-C major (V7-I) cadence.\n\nThe term \"Backdoor\" has been used by author Shelton Berg to refer to another entirely unrelated progression. The unexpected modulation created through the substitution of the highly similar I for iii (in C: CEGBD and EGBD) at the end of the ii-V turnaround to a tonicized iii (ii/iii=iv, V/iii=VII, iii), arrives at 'home' (the temporary tonic of iii) through unexpected means, the 'back door' instead of the 'front door'(iii, the individual notes EGBD, being entirely contained within I, the individual notes of the C major chord, CEGBD, and the seventh of the dominant seventh chord still resolving downward). The resolution of a dominant seventh chord up a step (in this case a half-step, also called a semitone) is called a deceptive cadence.\n\n"}

The company was based in Chicago, Illinois, United States.\n\nWilliam J. Halligan founded his own radio manufacturing company in Chicago in late 1932. Prior to this, he had been involved in radio parts sales for some years but decided the time was right for a handcrafted amateur radio receiver - the company name being a combination of Halli(gan) and (hand)crafters.\n\nThe new company was located at 417 State Street and immediately ran into patent difficulties when RCA decided to sue them for building radio sets without an RCA patent license. An opportunity came to purchase the concern of Silver-Marshall Inc. in 1933 and, with it, an RCA patent license as the most valuable asset.\n\nIn order to meet their financial obligations, Hallicrafters produced radios for other manufacturers until they were financially able to begin production of their own line of communications receivers, starting with the SX-9 'Super Skyrider', in late 1935.\n\nBy 1938, Hallicrafters was doing business in eighty-nine countries and manufactured the most popular sets in the USA. That year, the company began to produce radio transmitters. With the outbreak of World War II, the company prepared for wartime production, and was responsible for new designs and innovations for use by the U.S. troops; probably the best-known were the HT-4/BC-610 and related equipment used in the military SCR-299 communications package.\nProduction of Ham radio gear and other items was suspended until 1945. After the war, focus was again on consumer electronics, including radio phonographs, AM/FM receivers, clock radios and televisions.\n\nThe boom years for Hallicrafters were from 1945 to 1963, during which the company produced equipment considered by many to be superbly designed, including the famous S-38 receiver, which received a cosmetic \"makeover\" by industrial designer Raymond Loewy. \n\nIn 1952 Hallicrafters' main plant in Chicago housed general offices and the factory and was a block long. In addition to the main plant was a 3-story building of two blocks away, a 1-story coil plant of on Chicago's north side, and of production and storage space in three other buildings within a five-mile radius of the main plant. The company employed 2,500 people.\n\nDuring the Cold war era, the company took active participation in the Blue Streak (UK) and Atlas (U.S.) missile projects, helped to develop capability for many areas of electronic warfare and in missile field, including code translator data systems, ground support equipment, electronic countermeasures testing and antenna systems, infrared homing techniques, also company provided tactically deployed maintenance and technical support teams for mentioned missile systems, it supplied airborne target simulator system for Nike Zeus, electronic countermeasure systems for Douglas EB-66E and Boeing B-52 aircraft. Its R&D divisions (Manson Laboratories in Wilton, Connecticut, and Military Electronics Division in Chicago) developed penetration aids for intercontinental ballistic missiles and participated in various other classified programs. In the words of its advertising sloganry, the company supported “America’s defense umbrella.”\n\nIn 1966 Halligan sold the company to the Northrop Corporation and Halligan family involvement ended. Northrop ran the company until the early 1970s, but by this time, fierce Japanese competition was putting pressure on the US domestic electronics market. Northrop sold the company name (but kept the factory, by then located in Rolling Meadows, a Chicago suburb) in 1975, bringing non-military electronics production to an end. The Hallicrafters plant became Northrop Corporation's Defense Systems Division.\n\nThe name and assets of Hallicrafters were traded over the following years, even though there were no products bearing the name. Since around 1988, the remaining assets and rights to the 'Hallicrafters' name and logos have been held by court-appointed trustees. (Note: one known 1980s product bearing the Hallicrafters name does exist - a 4-line plus intercom telephone.)\n\nHallicrafters equipment remains in use by collectors and vintage amateur radio enthusiasts. \n\nSome of the more well-known Hallicrafters equipment from the pre-war period include:\n\n\n\n\nPostwar Hallicrafters models include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is believed that he (or she) will establish universal peace and justice in the manner of similar figures, such as King Arthur in European folklore. The Ratu Adil is first mentioned in the Pralembang Joyoboyo, the set of prophecies ascribed to the 12th century King Jayabaya of Kediri. The Ratu Adil is described in Jayabaya's prophecies, also according to the 19th century poet Ranggawarsita; as a figure who has an exceptional ability to lead the country.\n\nThe prophecy predicts that in a time of a great peril, the Ratu Adil will come from an unassuming background; either he or she will come from a modest family, poor, and at first unknown.\n\nIt is believed that Ratu Adil has exceptional qualities identified as Hastabrata, an eight characteristics symbolized by sun, moon, stars, earth, ocean, wind, fire and water.\n\nIn Indonesian history, this belief was highly advantageous to most early nationalist leaders. The prophecy also talks about the decline of the nobility as the established rulers.\n\nIn Javanese history, there are several examples or episodes that in the time of chaos, injustice, or great peril, a man from unassuming background or unpredicted position, could successfully rise, seized the power, and become the \"Ratu\" (Javanese term equate to \"King/Queen/Leader\"). This historic figures among others includes Airlangga the King of Kahuripan, Ken Angrok, the founder of Rajasa Dynasty of Singhasari, and Raden Wijaya, the founder of Majapahit. They mostly took the role as the dynastic founder.\n\nIn the Javanese religious tradition or Kejawen, it is believed that certain events are preordained by the gods, the divine or God almighty. It is believed that in the time of great danger and injustice, a hero will come and restore the sacred order. This is reminiscent of the function of Vishnu's avatars in Hinduism, or Maitreya bodhisatva in Buddhism. After the adoption of the Islamic faith, local tradition took its Islamic counterpart as the Messianic figure of Imam Mahdi. Thus in Javanese perspective, a Ratu Adil is its own version of Messiah or Great Just King that will deliver the people from injustice and restore order in Java or by extension, Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago).\n\nThe mantle of Ratu Adil has been applied to a number of persons in recent Indonesian history, including Prince Diponegoro, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, Tjokroaminoto, President Sukarno and Dutch military officer Raymond Westerling.\n\nLater, a Dutch-Indonesian Pencak Silat pioneer, Rudy Terlinden, gave his pencak silat style the name of Ratu Adil.

The Bandit series includes the following models:\n\nWith the exception of GSX150, which is powered by a DOHC single cylinder engine, all Bandit models have DOHC inline-four engines with 4 valves per cylinder. The GSF600 engine is based on the GSX600F engine, retuned for more mid-range torque. The GSF1200 engine is a bored out version of the GSX-R1100 engine, also retuned for more mid-range torque. The GSF650 and GSF1250 models use fuel-injected, liquid-cooled engines, the GSF1250 having an auxiliary balance shaft to reduce vibrations.\n\n'S' versions have a half-fairing, and starting from model year 2000, they also have dual headlights. 'N' versions are unfaired naked bikes with a single headlight. The availability of the 'S' and 'N' versions varies with country and model year.\n\nThe Bandit series earned a reputation as \"hooligan bikes\". With more recent revisions, however, the bike has taken on a more streamlined and modern feel, taking it more towards sports tourer territory. The GSF1200 remains popular with stunt riders, and is used by a wheelie school in the UK.\n\nLaunched in 1989, the GSF250 and GSF400 are naked street motorcycles, with liquid-cooled, inline four cylinder engines derived from the GSX-R250 and GSX-R400 motorcycles, mounted as a stressed member in a steel trellis frame with single rear shock absorber. Apart from the engines and transmission, the \"baby Bandits\" share many of their parts. Limited editions have a retro-styled top fairing. 'N' designated models have clip-on handlebars. \"GSF\" and \"Bandit\" nomenclature are both used across the series' chronology and market geography.\n\nThe first generation GSF250 (GJ74A) produces , while the GSF400 (GK75A) produces . The GSF400 manages the extra power with a 525 chain and double disk front brakes (single disk in North America), compared to a 520 chain and single front disk on the GSF250.\n\nFrom 1991, the GSF400V received variable inlet timing via solenoid-controlled rocker arm engaging with supplementary cams. Although these models are commonly referred to as \"GSF400V-V\", the '-V' actually denotes the 1997 Suzuki model year motorcycles. VVT models are usually recognised by a red engine cover and some instances of a light grey engine cover. The GSF250V arrived later, in 1995.\n\nIn 1992, engine adjustments improved low-mid range torque trading off peak power reduced to for the GSF400 and for the GSF250.\n\nIn 1995, the second generation GSF250V (GJ77A) and GSF400(V) (GK7AA) introduced significant updates, including new styling, fuel tank, swingarm, air filter assembly, exhaust, seat, controls, console, etc.\n\nGSF250 models\n\n\nGSF400 models\n\n\n1995\n\nThe naked GSF600 N Bandit was released in February. \nIt was based on the styling of the pre-existing GSF400 Bandit, with a retuned engine from the GSX600. The 600 Bandits came with a 15 tooth front sprocket and 48 tooth rear sprocket connected by a 530V 110 link chain.\n\n1996\nThe faired Bandit S model was introduced, where the bikini half-fairing had its debut.\n\n1997\n\nMinor changes: A clutch switch (requiring the clutch to be pulled in when starting the motorcycle, for safety reasons) and carburettor heaters.\n\n1998\n\nThe N model had passenger grab rails added. However, the S model had no changes.\n\n1999\n\nDebut of a new rear shock absorber, providing rebound as well as preload adjustment.\n\n2000\n\nThe first major changes were made this year.\n\n\n2001\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n2002\n\nFuel gauge now as standard.\n\n2003\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n2004\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n2005\nThe Bandit 650 and half-faired Bandit 650S launch took place at Tarragona, Spain.\n\n2006\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n2007\nSuzuki designed a new, water-cooled engine specifically for the 2007 Bandit 650, unlike earlier models where they used re-worked engines from other models. Most of the chassis and bodywork remained unchanged from the 2005 model, though.\n\n\nThe 2007 Bandit 650 was reviewed by \"Bike\" magazine as being \"de-criminalised\" compared to its early brethren, but a good bike for beginners.\n\nNo longer available in the US.\n\n2008\n\nNo longer available in Canada. Replaced by new Bandit-derived fully faired GSX650F in North America.\n\n2009\n\nIn November 2008, Suzuki announced the following changes for the 2009 GSF650N and GSX650S.\n\nSuzuki also announced the following changes.\n\nThe GSX650F, produced from 2008, is essentially a variation on the Bandit 650, with much the same specification and components. Although built on a Bandit chassis, the additional lower fairing gives it a sportier look similar to that of the GSX-R series. The engine has also had a small amount of remapping to encourage revs, and the suspension is tweaked. It also has a different, one-piece seat.\n\nThe Bandit 750 was a Japan only model that used parts from both the 600 and 1200 models; the front frame cradle was identical to the 600, the rear subframe was identical to the 1200 with bolt on pillion footpeg handers, the clocks were 1200 items with a higher red-line on the rev counter of 12,000rpm (vs 10,000 for the 1200), including a fuel gauge which was absent from the 600 models of the time. The running gear and suspension were also the same as the 600. The engine, although visually identical to the 600, had a capacity of 748 cc, The carburettors were similar to the 600 apart from jetting, whereas the exhaust was identical to the 1200. The 750 came with a 6 speed gearbox like the 600 - as opposed to the 5 speed on the 1200. Power was a claimed . All machines were restricted to to comply with Japanese regulations, but are easily de-restricted to a true maximum speed of .\n\n1996\n\nThe Bandit 1200 was generally released in January 1996, but a few were registered in 1995. It is powered by a re-tuned and higher capacity version of the GSX-R1100 engine. Other differences from the 600 cc models include fuel gauge, higher specification suspension, hydraulically operated clutch, larger diameter front brake discs, and 5-speed gearbox as opposed to the 6-speed gearbox of the 600 Bandit.\n\nMany Suzuki motorcycles have the engine size cast into side of the cylinder block; 1200 Bandits (1,157 cc) do not have this but, apparently, some early production 1995 models do have 1,156 cc cast into the block. The 1200 Bandits have 15 tooth front sprockets and 45 tooth rear sprockets connected by 530V, 110 link rear chains.\n\n1997\n\nNo changes. A version of the S Bandit with anti-lock braking was introduced for certain world markets. The 1997 ABS (anti-lock braking system) 1200 Bandit used a 114 link chain as opposed to the standard 110 link chain.\n\n1998–2000\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n2001\n\nThe 1200 Bandits received a similar revamp to the one the 600 Bandits received the previous year:\n\n\n2004\n\n2004 models added a 2-way catalytic converter (for some markets) to the exhaust system, and minor modifications to the exhaust metalwork.\n\n2005\n\n2005 models (K5 and SK5) were the last of the 2nd Generation 1200 Bandits.\n\n2006\n\n2006 (K6 and SK6) models received a revamp with a new shape tank, side panels, a height adjustable seat and a longer hexagonal-section swinging arm. The faired \"S\" versions also have a new shape fairing and mirrors along with a totally redesigned headlight system with over and under beams rather than the previous side by side system. These new models were offered with ABS brakes as an option. ABS brakes were fitted as standard on the UK specification SA model. Some markets also received height-adjustable handlebars. There were minor revisions to the transmission internal ratios as well. The 2006 Bandit 1200s were not sold in the US but continued to be sold elsewhere around the world. The SK6 version is in generation 3 of the Bandit 1200S line and thus is the sole generation 3 model of the 1200 Bandit. This was the last of the SACS-engined Bandits with a motor design and technology that first saw the light of day in 1985 in the GSX-R750.\n\n2007\n\nThe GSF1250 Bandit range is launched. It has a new petrol injection, water-cooled engine which is compliant with Euro 3 emission regulations. \nThe new engine generates similar power and torque to the earlier 1,200cc engine but the torque of is available at the lower engine speed of 3,750 RPM. An auxiliary balance shaft reduces engine vibrations. The GSF1250 also has a new six-speed constant mesh gearbox with the input shaft mounted below the crankshaft to reduce the length of the engine. This allows a longer swingarm for improved handling.\n\nThe GSF1250SA version has ABS and Autumn 2007 saw the introduction of the limited edition Street Fighter, featuring a single seat with matching rear cowling, Renthal handlebars, and Yoshimura silencer.\n\n2008\n\nThe 2007 GSF1250 and GSX1250SA are unchanged.\n\nThe 1250GT Grand Touring version is introduced with a three-box hard luggage system, fairing lowers and sat-nav.\n\n2009\n\n2009 models carry over the same engines. The cylinders are once again plated with Suzuki’s \"Composite Electrochemical Material\", and also carried over is the Secondary Balancer Shaft further smoothens the rides.\n\nIn May 2009, it was announced that there will be a limited edition Bandit 1250SA 'Z'. It has a pearl mirage white paint scheme, with revised graphics and metallic silver wheels. Only 100 examples came to the UK.\n\n2010\n\nIn September 2009 it was announced that 2010 will see the release of the GSX1250FA in Europe. It has the same engine and chassis as before, but a full fairing will make it similar in style to the smaller GSX650F.\n\nThe standard 1250A and 1250SA models for 2010 will feature a black engine.\n\n2011\n\nGSX1250FA remains unchanged from 2010 but comes to the US as a 2011 model.\n\n2015\n\nSuzuki reintroduced the GSF1250SA Bandit with a new half-fairing designed to wrap around the radiator shrouds, and added a front vent below the headlight to smooth out airflow behind the fairing.\n\nIn some markets, including both the UK and US, Suzuki has dropped the 'Bandit' name for the GSX1250 models. Produced from 2010 and last appearing as a 2012 model, it is essentially a fully faired version of the Bandit 1250 with top and side cases, windshield and more in its accessories list. Together with its partially faired model sibling it got a CARB certification and should return to the US market as a 2016 model.\n\nThe first single-cylinder Bandit motorcycle, the GSX150 was introduced at the August 2018 Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in South Tangerang. The GSX150 was built to accommodate Indonesian market demand for more comfortable commuter bike. It is based on the GSX-S150 standard motorcycle (itself based on the sport bike) with changes on the headlight, taillight and chassis to support a lower tandem seat.\n\nIn March 2019, the GSX150 was launched in Thailand and is imported from Indonesia.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040756", "title": "Homotopy category", "text": "Homotopy category\n\nIn mathematics, the homotopy category is a category built from the category of topological spaces which in a sense identifies two spaces that have the same shape. The phrase is in fact used for two different (but related) categories, as discussed below.\n\nMore generally, instead of starting with the category of topological spaces, one may start with any model category and define its associated homotopy category, with a construction introduced by Quillen in 1967. In this way, homotopy theory can be applied to many other categories in geometry and algebra. \n\nThe category of topological spaces Top has objects the topological spaces and morphisms the continuous maps between them. The older definition of the homotopy category hTop, called the naive homotopy category for clarity in this article, has the same objects, and a morphism is a homotopy class of continuous maps. That is, two continuous maps \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" are considered the same in the naive homotopy category if one can be continuously deformed to the other. There is a functor from Top to hTop that sends spaces to themselves and morphisms to their homotopy classes. A map \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" is called a homotopy equivalence if it becomes an isomorphism in the naive homotopy category.\n\nExample: The circle \"S\", the plane R minus the origin, and the Möbius strip are all homotopy equivalent, although these topological spaces are not homeomorphic.\n\nThe notation [\"X\",\"Y\"] is often used for the set of morphisms from a space \"X\" to a space \"Y\" in the naive homotopy category (but it is also used for the related categories discussed below).\n\nQuillen (1967) emphasized another category which further simplifies the category of topological spaces. Homotopy theorists have to work with both categories from time to time, but the consensus is that Quillen's version is more important, and so it is often called simply the \"homotopy category\".\n\nOne first defines a weak homotopy equivalence: a continuous map is called a weak homotopy equivalence if it induces a bijection on sets of path components and a bijection on homotopy groups with arbitrary base points. Then the (true) homotopy category is defined by localizing the category of topological spaces with respect to the weak homotopy equivalences. That is, the objects are still the topological spaces, but an inverse morphism is added for each weak homotopy equivalence. This has the effect that a continuous map becomes an isomorphism in the homotopy category if and only if it is a weak homotopy equivalence. There are obvious functors from the category of topological spaces to the naive homotopy category (as defined above), and from there to the homotopy category.\n\nResults of J.H.C. Whitehead, in particular Whitehead's theorem and the existence of CW approximations, give a more explicit description of the homotopy category. Namely, the homotopy category is equivalent to the full subcategory of the naive homotopy category that consists of CW complexes. In this respect, the homotopy category strips away much of the complexity of the category of topological spaces.\n\nExample: Let \"X\" be the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} and let \"Y\" be the set {0} ∪ {1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}, both with the subspace topology from the real line. Define \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" by mapping 0 to 0 and \"n\" to 1/\"n\" for positive integers \"n\". Then \"f\" is continuous, and in fact a weak homotopy equivalence, but it is not a homotopy equivalence. Thus the naive homotopy category distinguishes spaces such as \"X\" and \"Y\", whereas they become isomorphic in the homotopy category.\n\nFor topological spaces \"X\" and \"Y\", the notation [\"X\",\"Y\"] may be used for the set of morphisms from \"X\" to \"Y\" in either the naive homotopy category or the true homotopy category, depending on the context. \n\nOne motivation for these categories is that many invariants of topological spaces are defined on the naive homotopy category or even on the true homotopy category. For example, for a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\", the associated homomorphism \"f\": \"H\"(\"X\",Z) → \"H\"(\"Y\",Z) of singular homology groups is an isomorphism for all natural numbers \"i\". It follows that, for each natural number \"i\", singular homology \"H\" can be viewed as a functor from the homotopy category to the category of abelian groups. In particular, two homotopic maps from \"X\" to \"Y\" induce the \"same\" homomorphism on singular homology groups.\n\nSingular cohomology has an even better property: it is a representable functor on the homotopy category. That is, for each abelian group \"A\" and natural number \"i\", there is a CW complex \"K\"(\"A\",\"i\") called an Eilenberg–MacLane space and a cohomology class \"u\" in \"H\"(\"K\"(\"A\",\"i\"),\"A\") such that the resulting function\n(giving by pulling \"u\" back to \"X\") is bijective for all topological spaces \"X\". Here [\"X\",\"Y\"] must be understood to mean the set of maps in the true homotopy category, if one wants this statement to hold for all topological spaces \"X\". It holds in the naive homotopy category if \"X\" is a CW complex.\n\nOne useful variant is the homotopy category of pointed spaces. A pointed space means a pair (\"X\",\"x\") with \"X\" a topological space and \"x\" a point in \"X\", called the base point. The category Top of pointed spaces has objects the pointed spaces, and a morphism \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" is a continuous map that takes the base point of \"X\" to the base point of \"Y\". The naive homotopy category of pointed spaces has the same objects, and morphisms are homotopy classes of pointed maps (meaning that the base point remains fixed throughout the homotopy). Finally, the \"true\" homotopy category of pointed spaces is obtained from the category Top by inverting the pointed maps that are weak homotopy equivalences.\n\nFor pointed spaces \"X\" and \"Y\", [\"X\",\"Y\"] may denote the set of morphisms from \"X\" to \"Y\" in either version of the homotopy category of pointed spaces, depending on the context.\n\nSeveral basic constructions in homotopy theory are naturally defined on the category of pointed spaces (or on the associated homotopy category), not on the category of spaces. For example, the suspension Σ\"X\" and the loop space Ω\"X\" are defined for a pointed space \"X\" and produce another pointed space. Also, the smash product \"X\" ∧ \"Y\" is an important functor of pointed spaces \"X\" and \"Y\". For example, the suspension can be defined as\n\nThe suspension and loop space functors form an adjoint pair of functors, in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism\n\nfor all spaces \"X\" and \"Y.\"\n\nWhile the objects of a homotopy category are sets (with additional structure), the morphisms are not actual functions between them, but rather a classes of functions (in the naive homotopy category) or \"zigzags\" of functions (in the homotopy category). Indeed, Freyd showed that neither the naive homotopy category of pointed spaces nor the homotopy category of pointed spaces is a concrete category. That is, there is no faithful functor from these categories to the category of sets.\n\nThere is a more general concept: the homotopy category of a model category. A model category is a category \"C\" with three distinguished types of morphisms called fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences, satisfying several axioms. The associated homotopy category is defined by localizing \"C\" with respect to the weak equivalences.\n\nThis construction, applied to the model category of topological spaces with its standard model structure (sometimes called the Quillen model structure), gives the homotopy category defined above. Many other model structures have been considered on the category of topological spaces, depending on how much one wants to simplify the category. For example, in the Hurewicz model structure on topological spaces, the associated homotopy category is the naive homotopy category defined above.\n\nThe same homotopy category can arise from many different model categories. An important example is the standard model structure on simplicial sets: the associated homotopy category is equivalent to the homotopy category of topological spaces, even though simplicial sets are combinatorially defined objects that lack any topology. Some topologists prefer instead to work with compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces; again, with the standard model structure, the associated homotopy category is equivalent to the homotopy category of all topological spaces.\n\nFor a more algebraic example of a model category, let \"A\" be a Grothendieck abelian category, for example the category of modules over a ring or the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space. Then there is a model structure on the category of chain complexes of objects in \"A\", with the weak equivalences being the quasi-isomorphisms. The resulting homotopy category is called the derived category \"D\"(\"A\").\n\nFinally, the stable homotopy category is defined as the homotopy category associated to a model structure on the category of spectra. Various different categories of spectra have been considered, but all the accepted definitions yield the same homotopy category.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040766", "title": "Idealism in international relations", "text": "Idealism in international relations\n\nIdealism in the foreign policy context holds that a nation-state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its conduct and rhetoric in international affairs. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. Both within and outside of the United States, American president Woodrow Wilson is widely considered an early advocate of idealism and codifier of its practical meaning; specific actions cited include the issuing of the famous \"Fourteen Points\".\n\nWilson's idealism was a precursor to liberal international relations theory, the particular set of viewpoints arising amongst the so-called \"institution builders\" after World War II. Organizations that came about as a direct result of the war's outcome include the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Nations (UN) among others. Given the outsize role of the U.S. in drafting and maintaing those such institutions, related doctrines include the notion of American exceptionalism and the sense of a Pax Americana, though the foreign policy of the United States has varied widely based on the officials in charge of the country.\n\nIn the broader, philosophical sense, this internationally-minded viewpoint can be thought of as an extension of the moral idealism advocated by different thinkers during and after the \"Age of Enlightenment\". That particular era involved multiple prominent individuals promoting a general sense of benevolence and government based upon strong personal character, with international conflict criticized as against the principles of reason.\n\nMore generally, academic Michael W. Doyle has described idealism as based on the belief that other nations' stated positive intentions can be relied on, whereas realism holds that said intentions are in the long run subject to the security dilemma described by thinker John H. Herz. Although realism in the context of foreign affairs is traditionally seen as the opposite of idealism, numerous scholars and individual leaders in charge of different nations have sought to synthesize the two schools of thought.\n\nScholar Hedley Bull has written:\nSince the 1880s, there has been growing study of the major writers of this idealist tradition of thought in international relations, including Sir Alfred Zimmern, Norman Angell, John Maynard Keynes, John A. Hobson, Leonard Woolf, Gilbert Murray, Florence Stawell (known as Melian Stawell), Philip Henry Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian, Arnold J. Toynbee, Lester Pearson and David Davies.\n\nMuch of this writing has contrasted these idealist writers with 'realists' in the tradition of E. H. Carr, whose \"The Twenty Years' Crisis\" (1939) both coined the term 'idealist' and was a fierce and effective assault on the inter-war idealists.\nIdealism is centered on the notion that states are rational actors capable of ensuring lasting peace and security rather than resorting to war.\n\nIdealism is also marked by the prominent role played by international law and international organizations in its conception of policy formation. One of the most well-known tenets of modern idealist thinking is democratic peace theory, which holds that states with similar modes of democratic governance do not fight one another. Wilson's idealistic thought was embodied in his Fourteen points speech, and in the creation of the League of Nations.\n\nIdealism transcends the left-right political spectrum. Idealists can include both human rights campaigners (advocates for a cause traditionally, but not always, associated with the left) and promoters of American neoconservatism, with the latter ideological movement usually associated with the right.\n\nIdealism may find itself in opposition to Realism, a worldview which argues that a nation's national interest is more important than ethical or moral considerations; however, there need be no conflict between the two (see Neoconservatism for an example of a confluence of the two). Realist thinkers include Hans Morgenthau, Niccolò Machiavelli, Otto von Bismarck, George F. Kennan and others. Recent practitioners of Idealism in the United States have included Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\n\nLink finds that Wilson from his earliest days had imbibed the beliefs of his denomination - in the omnipotence of God, the morality of the Universe, a system of rewards and punishments and the notion that nations, as well as man, transgressed the laws of God at their peril. Blum (1956) argues that he learned from William Ewart Gladstone a mystic conviction in the superiority of Anglo-Saxons, in their righteous duty to make the world over in their image. Moral principle, constitutionalism, and faith in God were among the prerequisites for alleviating human strife. While he interpreted international law within such a brittle, moral cast, Wilson remained remarkably insensitive to new and changing social forces and conditions of the 20th century. He expected too much justice in a morally brutal world which disregarded the self-righteous resolutions of parliaments and statesmen like himself. Wilson's triumph was as a teacher of international morality to generations yet unborn. Daniel Patrick Moynihan sees Wilson's vision of world order anticipated humanity prevailing through the \"Holy Ghost of Reason,\" a vision which rested on religious faith.\n\nWilson's views were based on the future welfare of humankind. He called for a world made safe democracy, this was organized around political, economic and social standards. These principles were stated in his 14-point peace program. Wilson thought of this program as an American commitment to show man kind the way of liberty. The core of Wilson's program was a league of nations committed to peace, and bringing down tyranny which was thought to be the root of war. The idea was that if democracy could be widespread peace and prosperity would prevail.\n\nWilson's diplomatic policies had a profound influence on shaping the world. Diplomatic historian Walter Russell Mead has explained:\n\nAmerican foreign relations since 1914 have rested on Wilsonian idealism, says historian David Kennedy, even if adjusted somewhat by the \"realism\" represented by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Henry Kissinger. Kennedy argues that every president since Wilson has \"embraced the core precepts of Wilsonianism. Nixon himself hung Wilson's portrait in the White House Cabinet Room. Wilson's ideas continue to dominate American foreign policy in the twenty-first century. In the aftermath of 9/11 they have, if anything, taken on even greater vitality.\"\n\nAccording to revisionist narrative, there was never a single 'great debate' between idealism and realism. Lucian M. Ashworth argues, the persistence of the notion that there was a real debate between idealism and realism, says less about the actual discussions of the time, and more about the marginalisation of liberal and normative thinking in the international relations in the post-war period. Richard Devetak wrote in his international relations textbook:The structure of Carr’s masterpiece revolves around the dichotomy between realism and liberalism. In fact, he helped create the impression that the newly established discipline was dominated by a debate between realism and liberalism. This subsequently became known as the ‘first great debate’, although – as Andreas Osiander (1998), Peter Wilson (1998), Lucian Ashworth (1999), and Quirk and Vigneswaran (2005) have shown – no debate actually occurred, if by that we mean a series of exchanges between realists and liberals. Indeed, recent work suggests that the very idea of narrating the discipline’s history as a series of ‘great debates’ is questionable. Even so, it is important for students to learn and appreciate the stories the discipline has told about itself, which is why I persist with the narrative.\n\nIdealism proper has been argued to be a relatively short-lived school of thought, and advocates particularly suffered a crisis of confidence following the failure of the League of Nations and the outbreak of World War II. However, subsequent theories of international relations have significantly drawn elements from Wilsonian-style idealism when constructing their world views. In addition, scholars describing themselves either as idealists or as sympathetic to the school of thought have remained active in international relations studies.\n\nLiberalism manifested as a tempered version of Wilson's idealism in the wake of World War II. Cognizant of the failures of idealism to prevent renewed isolationism following World War II in certain areas, and its inability to manage the balance of power in Europe to prevent the outbreak of a new war, liberal thinkers devised a set of international institutions based on rule of law and regularized interaction. These international organizations, such as the United Nations and the NATO, or even international regimes such as the Bretton Woods system, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), were calculated both to maintain a balance of power as well as regularize cooperation between nations.\n\nNeoconservatism has drawn from historical liberalism its intense focus on the promotion of \"universal values\", in this case democracy, human rights, free trade, women's rights and minority protections. However, it differs in that it is less wedded to the importance of preserving international institutions and treaties while pursuing assertive or aggressive stances which it deems morally worthy, and is willing to use force or the threat of force, unilaterally if necessary, to push for its goals.\n\n\n"}

The band is especially notable as Calvin Johnson's first ensemble and one of the earlier expressions of the Olympia music scene that developed in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nJohnson wrote most of the band's songs, with assistance on lyrics from Ed Gaidrich. The entire band worked together to set Johnson's lyrics to music. Cool Rays played at least one cover song: Jonathan Richman's \"Modern World\". The songwriting characteristics associated with Johnson's later work (simple stories, childlike sensibilities, use of catchy phrases from American vernacular, quirky juxtaposition of words and ideas, etc.) are present in their earliest form in his Cool Rays compositions, as is Johnson's \"uniquely deep, droning singing voice\" \n\n\nDuring its short existence, the band played several concerts in Olympia and one in Portland, Oregon. The band had more musical creativity than musicianship, with two of the band members having taken up instruments for the first time just to be able to participate.\n\nWhile certainly not the first amateur girl and boy band to come along, Cool Rays embodied what became some of the motivating ideas (and ideals) of the Olympia music scene: that one need not be a formally trained or professional (or stereotyped) musician to make music; local people should make their own music (rather than passively relying on the \"corporate ogre\" music business to provide it); and girls should play a more active role in the making of rock music.\n\nCool Rays benefited from a devoted following among certain students and downtown Olympia residents, however, the group's popularity did not spread far. In the late 1970s, many younger music listeners had not embraced punk and other emerging genres. Local tastes tended toward hard rock, psychedelic and folk-rock musical motifs.\n\nThe band dispersed in the summer of 1981, after the end of the Evergreen State College academic year.\n\nCool Rays is briefly referenced in \"Our Band Could Be Your Life\" by Michael Azerrad (Little Brown, 2001).\n\nIn spring 1981, Cool Rays made an unpublished audio cassette produced by Steve Fisk and recorded in the recording studios of the Evergreen State College. A few of the compositions from that cassette were subsequently released as part of compilations of Olympia- and Seattle-based artists:\n"}

The battle, fought on 23 and 24 March 1885 on the Tonkin-Guangxi border, saw the defeat of 1,500 soldiers of General François de Négrier's 2nd Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps by a Chinese army under the command of the Guangxi military commissioner Pan Dingxin ().\n\nThe battle set the scene for the French retreat from Lạng Sơn on 28 March and the conclusion of the Sino-French War in early April in circumstances of considerable embarrassment for France.\n\nOn 17 February 1885 General Louis Brière de l'Isle, the general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, left Lạng Sơn with Lieutenant-Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade to relieve the Siege of Tuyên Quang. On 3 March, at the Battle of Hòa Mộc, Giovanninelli's men broke through a formidable Chinese blocking position and relieved the siege. Before his departure Brière de l'Isle ordered General François de Négrier, who remained at Lạng Sơn with the 2nd Brigade, to press on towards the Chinese border and expel the battered remnants of the Guangxi Army from Tonkinese soil. After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, de Négrier defeated the Guangxi Army at the Battle of Đồng Đăng on 23 February and cleared it from Tonkinese territory. For good measure, the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the Tonkin-Guangxi border. They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and the 2nd Brigade returned to Lạng Sơn at the end of February.\n\nBy early March, in the wake of the French victories at Hòa Mộc and Dong Dang, the military situation in Tonkin had reached a temporary stalemate. Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade faced Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army around Hưng Hóa and Tuyên Quang, while de Négrier's 2nd Brigade at Lạng Sơn faced Pan Dingxin's Guangxi Army. Neither Chinese army had any realistic prospect of launching an offensive for several weeks, while the two French brigades that had jointly captured Lạng Sơn in February were not strong enough to inflict a decisive defeat on either Chinese army separately. Brière de l'Isle and de Négrier examined the possibility of crossing into Guangxi with the 2nd Brigade to capture the major Chinese military depot at Longzhou, but on 17 March Brière de l'Isle advised the army ministry in Paris that such an operation was beyond their strength. Substantial French reinforcements reached Tonkin in the middle of March, giving Brière de l'Isle a brief opportunity to break the stalemate. He moved the bulk of the reinforcements to Hưng Hóa to reinforce the 1st Brigade, intending to attack the Yunnan Army and drive it back beyond Yen Bay. While he and Giovanninelli drew up plans for a western offensive, he ordered de Négrier to keep the Chinese in respect around Lạng Sơn.\n\nMeanwhile, behind the Chinese border, the Guangxi Army was also building up its strength. The French, whose Vietnamese spies in Longzhou had been conscientiously counting the company flags of every Chinese battalion that passed through the town, estimated on 17 March that they were facing a Chinese force of 40,000 men. This was an exaggeration, based on the assumption that each Chinese company was at full strength. In fact most of the Chinese commands were considerably understrength with 300 to 400 men, and the strength of the Guangxi Army at the Battle of Zhennan Pass was probably around a couple thousand men, while all of Longzhou had 25,000 to 30,000 men under arms. Even at this lower strength, it fearfully outnumbered the French.\n\nBy the middle of March nine separate Chinese military commands were massed close up to the Tonkinese border around the enormous entrenched camps of Yen Cua Ai and Bang Bo. There were six main Chinese concentrations. The entrenched camp of Yen Cua Ai was held by ten battalions under the command of Feng Zicai (冯子材) and a slightly smaller force under the command of Wang Xiaochi (王孝祺). These two commands numbered perhaps 7,500 men in all. Two to three kilometres behind Yen Cua Ai, around the village of Mufu, lay the commands of Su Yuanchun (苏元春) and Chen Jia (陳嘉), perhaps 7,000 men in all. Fifteen kilometres behind Mufu the commands of Jiang Zonghan (蔣宗汉) and Fang Yusheng (方友升), also 7,000 strong, were deployed around the village of Pingxiang (known to the French from its Vietnamese pronunciation as Binh Thuong). The commander of the Guangxi Army, Pan Dingxin (潘鼎新), lay at Haicun, 30 kilometres behind Mufu, with 3,500 men. Fifty kilometres to the west of Zhennanguan, 3,500 men under the command of Wei Gang (魏刚) were deployed around the village of Aiwa. Finally, fifteen kilometres to the east of Zhennanguan, just inside Tonkin, Wang Debang (王德榜) occupied the village of Cua Ai with 3,500 men.\n\nDe Négrier's 2nd Brigade numbered around 1,500 men. The brigade's order of battle in March 1885 was as follows:\n\n\nRoussel's battery, of Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade, was also at Lạng Sơn. The battery had lagged behind during the Lạng Sơn Campaign, and Giovanninelli had left it at Lạng Sơn when he set out with the 1st Brigade to relieve Tuyên Quang.\n\nNot all of the 2nd Brigade was stationed at Lạng Sơn and immediately available for action. The four companies of Servière's 2nd African Battalion were echeloned between Lạng Sơn and Chu, guarding the vital French supply line up to Lạng Sơn and labouring to improve the miserable paths over which the expeditionary corps had advanced in February into a surfaced wagon road.\n\nOn 22 March, Chinese forces under the command of Feng Jicai（冯子材） raided the French forward post at Dong Dang, a few kilometres north of Lạng Sơn. The French post, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger, was held by \"chef de battalion\" Diguet's 2nd Foreign Legion Battalion, and the legionnaires repelled the Chinese assault without difficulty. De Négrier, who had been forced to bring the bulk of the 2nd Brigade up from Lạng Sơn to support Herbinger, decided to hit back immediately. Hoping to take the Chinese by surprise, he decided to cross the frontier and attack the Guangxi Army in its entrenchments at Bang Bo, near the frontier pass of Zhennanguan. He had no intention of launching a major offensive into Guangxi. His aim, in the military phrase of the day, was simply to 'take some air' (\"se donner de l'air\") around Dong Dang. After giving the Chinese a bloody nose at Bang Bo and clearing them away from the approaches to Dong Dang, he would return to Lạng Sơn with the 2nd Brigade.\n\nLeaving \"chef de bataillon\" Servière to hold Lạng Sơn with a single company of the 2nd African Battalion and Martin and Roussel's batteries, and stationing the 23rd Line Battalion at Dong Dang to protect his supply line, he advanced to the Chinese frontier at Zhennanguan on the morning of 23 March with a force of only 1,600 men and 10 guns (the 111th and 143rd Line Battalions, the 2nd and 3rd Legion Battalions and Roperh and de Saxcé's batteries). Substantial reinforcements for the 2nd Brigade were already on their way up to Lạng Sơn, but de Négrier decided not to wait for them. He judged it more important to attack the Chinese while they were still discouraged by Feng Zicai's repulse on 22 March.\n\nOn 23 and 24 March the 2nd Brigade fought a fierce action with the Guangxi Army near Zhennanguan. This engagement, known as the Battle of Zhennan Pass in China, is normally called Bang Bo in European sources, after the name of a village in the centre of the Chinese position where the fighting was fiercest. The French took a number of outworks on 23 March, and defeated a hesitant Chinese counterattack against their right flank launched by Wang Debang from Cua Ai.\n\nOn 24 March de Négrier attacked the Guangxi Army's main positions around Bang Bo. His plan called for a simultaneous frontal and rear attack on Feng Zicai's troops, who were holding a line of trenches in front of Bang Bo known to the French as the 'Long Trench'. The frontal attack would be delivered by Faure's 111th Battalion and the rear attack by Diguet's 2nd Legion Battalion and Farret's 143rd Battalion. Herbinger, who was instructed to guide Diguet and Farret to their attack positions, led the two battalions in a wide outflanking march in thick fog, and lost his way. De Négrier, unaware that Herbinger had failed to reach his positions, and mistaking a column of Chinese troops moving up to the Long Trench for Herbinger's two battalions, ordered \"chef de bataillon\" Faure's 111th Battalion to deliver its planned frontal attack.\n\nThe men of the 111th laid down their haversacks, formed up, and charged. The battalion came under heavy frontal fire from Feng Zicai's infantry and flanking fire from Chinese units on the nearby hills, and lost several company officers within seconds. Two of the four companies of the 111th Battalion reached the trench, but after a short spell of hand-to-hand fighting were thrown back by a Chinese counterattack led personally by Feng Zicai.\n\nThe senior surviving French company officer, Captain Verdier (who later wrote a detailed account of the campaign, \"La vérité sur la retraite de Lang-Son\", under the pseudonym Jacques Harmant), was able to disengage and rally the battalion. The Chinese, intent on beheading the French wounded and plundering the abandoned French haversacks, did not seriously pursue the 111th Battalion, and Verdier was able to withdraw its shredded companies to safety.\n\nAmong the officers who fell during the 111th Battalion's attack on the Long Trench was 2nd Lieutenant Rene Normand, shot in the throat and mortally wounded. Normand had only recently arrived in Tonkin, and had distinguished himself on 10 February 1885 at the engagement at Pho Vy during the Lạng Sơn Campaign. A collection of his letters from Tonkin, including a number of vivid descriptions of the February campaign to capture Lạng Sơn, would be published posthumously in France in 1886.\nOn the right of the battlefield, the 143rd Battalion and 2nd Legion Battalion went into action several hours later than expected, and captured a Chinese fort. It was the only French success of the day. At 3 p.m. Pan Dingxin, seeing the 111th Battalion in full retreat and Herbinger's men exhausted from their exertions, counterattacked along the entire front. Herbinger's command was nearly cut off. Captain Gayon's company of the 143rd Battalion was surrounded by the Chinese. Captain Patrick Cotter, an Irish officer in Diguet's Legion battalion, ignored an order from Herbinger to leave Gayon to his fate and led his Legion company to the rescue. The legionnaires charged and successfully disengaged Gayon's men, but Cotter was killed in the attack. Diguet and Farret's battalions fell back by echelons, constantly turning and firing to keep the Chinese in respect.\n\nMeanwhile, Schoeffer's 3rd Legion Battalion, which had been ordered to remain on Tonkinese soil around Dong Dang to protect the flanks of the French column, fought desperately to keep open a line of retreat for the 2nd Brigade. Schoeffer's men beat off strong Chinese attacks on both French flanks, enabling the other three infantry battalions and the two artillery batteries to make good their retreat. General de Négrier fought with the French rearguard, setting an example of personal courage, and the Chinese were unable to convert the French retreat into a rout. In the final flurry of action, just before nightfall, Captain Brunet of Schoeffer's battalion was shot dead.\n\nThere were ominous scenes of disorder as the defeated French regrouped after the battle, and de Négrier had to intervene sharply to quell them. As the brigade's morale was precarious and ammunition was running short, de Négrier decided to fall back to Lạng Sơn. On the evening of 24 March the brigade marched back to Dong Dang, where it camped for the night. Hungry, exhausted, and shocked by their defeat, many French troops found it difficult to credit what had happened. Sergeant Maury of Diguet's 2nd Legion Battalion was overcome by a nervous reaction:\n\nThe night was very dark. The soldiers marched in complete silence. We felt cheated, ashamed, and angry. We were leaving behind us both victory and many of our friends. From time to time, in low murmurs, we established who was missing. Then we relapsed into the silence of mourning and the bitterness of loss. And so we reached Dong Dang, without being disturbed. We slept in the field hospital huts, after drinking some soup. We were harassed and hungry. We had not eaten all day, and had drunk nothing since morning except a single cup of coffee. In spite of my weariness, I spent a troubled night. My spirits were haunted by the day's memories, by images of the fighting and phantasms of our misfortunes. I was shaken with spasms. I trembled as I have never done on the battlefield. I lay down, but was unable to sleep.\nAlthough the French made a fighting withdrawal from the battlefield and prevented the Chinese from piercing their line, casualties in the 2nd Brigade during the two-day battle were relatively heavy: 74 killed (including 7 officers) and 213 wounded (including 6 officers). Most of these casualties (70 killed and 188 wounded) were suffered on 24 March. The heaviest casualties were suffered by the 111th Battalion (31 killed and 58 wounded) and the 2nd Legion Battalion (12 killed and 68 wounded). There were also appreciable casualties in the 143rd Battalion (17 killed and 48 wounded) and the 3rd Legion Battalion (12 killed and 34 wounded).\n\nThe dead and mortally wounded officers included Captain Mailhat, Doctor Raynaud, Lieutenant Canin and 2nd Lieutenant Normand of the 111th Battalion, Lieutenant Thébaut of the 143rd Battalion, Captain Cotter of Diguet's Legion battalion and Captain Brunet of Schoeffer's Legion battalion. The wounded officers included \"chef de bataillon\" Tonnot of the Tonkinese Rifles, Lieutenant de Colomb of the 111th Battalion, Lieutenant Mangin and 2nd Lieutenant Bruneau of the 143rd Battalion and Lieutenant Durillon and 2nd Lieutenant Comignan of Diguet's battalion. Lieutenant Mangin died several days after the battle in Lạng Sơn, from shock following an operation to amputate a wounded limb.\n\nFrench estimates of Chinese casualties during the battle amounted to around 1,650 killed and wounded.\n\nThe French defeat at Bang Bo on 24 March 1885 shook the nerve of several French politicians who had earlier supported France's war against the Qing Dynasty. More importantly, it convinced Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger, de Négrier's second-in-command, that the 2nd Brigade was dangerously isolated at Lạng Sơn. On 28 March de Négrier was seriously wounded in the battle of Ky Lua, in which the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps defeated an attack by the Guangxi Army on the defences of Lạng Sơn. Herbinger assumed command of the 2nd Brigade, and immediately ordered a retreat to Kép and Chu. The battle of Bang Bo therefore paved the way for the Retreat from Lạng Sơn and the collapse of Jules Ferry's administration on 30 March in the Tonkin Affair. The battle, before the war ended due to negotiations, made the Qing Dynasty seem to be almost victorious in the entire war in light of the French defeats at Zhennan and Langson.\n\nThere is an action packed war movie, The War of Loong (2017) about Feng Zicai and the victory of Chinese troops in the Sino-French conflict (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7345928/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt).\n\n\n"}

It is the third road tunnel to cross Victoria Harbour, linking the newly reclaimed land in Yau Ma Tei on Kowloon West with Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island. It was constructed by the Western Harbour Tunnel Company Limited (WHTCL) on a 30-year franchise (1993–2023) build-operate-transfer (BOT) model proposed by the Government.\n\nWestern Harbour Crossing (WHC) is the first three-lane road tunnel in Asia to be constructed using submerged pipe, and is the newest of the three Victoria Harbour road tunnels. It is part of the Airport Core Programme which was a comprehensive set of infrastructure projects associated with the airport at Chek Lap Kok. The tunnel carries on the Route 3 designation from the West Kowloon Highway, and connects to Route 4 on Hong Kong Island.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the Cross-Harbour Tunnel (CHT) was already stretched beyond its designed capacity of 80,000 vehicle-trips daily, with in excess of 120,000. Furthermore, on the basis of population growth projected from 5.125m in 1981 to 6.34m in 2001, the Second Comprehensive Transport Study (CTS-2) in the late 1980s forecast an explosion in the number of cross-harbour trips – individual person trips would increase by 86% from 1.4m to 2.6m, and goods vehicle trips by 129% from 34,000 to 78,000 by 2001.\n\nAlso, with the development of the Hong Kong International Airport, it was to be an important component of the strategic Airport Core Programme linking it to the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals and Hong Kong Island. There are 10 km of associated roads (40 km of lanes) and 17 bridges.\n\nThe Government announced in 1990 that the tunnel project would be financed as a private venture, with bidding initially scheduled to be called in April 1991. As the project was to span the change in sovereignty of Hong Kong, the support of both the British and Chinese was necessary. In September 1991, the British and Chinese governments signed the Memorandum of Understanding committing their firm support for building the new airport at Chek Lap Kok and its connecting infrastructure. Since mid-1991, private sector companies interested in the project started looking for partners to form consortia. The formal tendering exercise was launched in March 1992 and ended in early July 1992.\n\nIn early 1992, two consortia appeared to be vying for the contract. However, one week before the closing date for tenders, Cross Harbour Tunnel Company and CITIC decided to merge their bids. Cross Harbour Tunnel Company, with Wharf Holdings as its major shareholder, dissolved its own consortium in favour of joining with CITIC group; the contractors of the CHT team were dropped. At the close of the tender, the Government was disappointed that there was only one bidder. Upon this news, two new consortia of construction companies proposed to build the project for the Government if the Government decided to pull the tender and run the project itself.\nIn 1993, the Western Harbour Crossing Ordinance (Cap. 436) was enacted to govern the construction and operation of tunnel. Having decided to rely on the private sector, the government opted for a build–operate–transfer (BOT) model, for 30 years. Tenders for the project were invited, and was won by the Western Harbour Tunnel Company (WHTCL). The franchise was awarded for 30 years, ending August 2023. The Western Harbour Crossing Bill was also passed to award the franchise to the Western Harbour Tunnel Company to build and operate WHC.\n\nWHTCL's single largest shareholder is The Cross-Harbour (Holdings) Limited (CHHL) 港通控股有限公司 SEHK: 0032, which has a 50% stake. Its other shareholders are CITIC Limited 中國中信股份有限公司 SEHK: 0267 and Kerry Properties Limited 嘉里建設有限公司 SEHK: 0683 which hold 35% and 15% effective interests in WHTCL respectively through a joint venture company.\n\nOn 5 June, 2019, an Australian based fund manager, Lanyon Asset Mangement Pty Limited, made a cash offer to acquire the 50% interest in the WHTCL from CHHL.\n\nOn 11 June 2019, Lanyon’s offer was rejected by CHHL.\n\nLanyon cited this was in the best interest of CHHL shareholders.\n\nThe project team consisted of John Mundy (project manager), John Porter of Nishimatsu (project director), Kazutoshi Torakai of Kumagai Gumi (technical director), K.C. Tsui (JV construction manager for the mechanical and electrical works), Sandy Hone (JV deputy project manager and construction manager for the civil works), Knud Poulsen (engineering manager), Alex Peling (commercial manager), Robert Lloyd, Eric Granville and Don Ramanaynke (the Government’s Highways Department Western Harbour Link Office engineers). The project cost was HK$7.5bn, funded privately. The project was completed in 1997.\n\nThe pipe itself is 2 km long.\n\nThe initial toll for private cars projected by the consortium was $30. The franchisee traffic forecast in January 1997 made before the tunnel opened was between 50,000 and 70,000 vehicle trips daily during the first year of operation. The actual number of daily trips did not exceed 47,000, and averaged at 20,000.\n\nThe Government and the consortium agreed on the toll and its future adjustment where the starting toll for private cars was proposed to be at HK$30. The agreed automatic adjustment mechanism would allow the franchisee to maintain the target rate of return of between 15% and 18.5%. The operator could also increase the tunnel toll by HK$10 whenever its IRR fell below 15%.\n\nLegislators, principally from the pan-democrat camp but including the Liberal Party, criticised the mechanism as being too generous in favour of the franchisee and were unwilling to approve the deal. The government feared that revision at LegCo would adversely impact project viability and force re-opening of negotiations with the consortium. Underlying that were fears the consortium and its banks may withdraw from the project, so wanted the bill voted through as a package.\n\nOne week before the final LegCo vote on the deal, in response to legislators' fears, the Liberal Party proposed an amendment that both the Government and the consortium found to be an acceptable compromise: to preserve the HK$30 opening toll, but the return on investment would be capped at 16.5% (instead of 18.5%) for the first three years after the tunnel opened; amounts above that would be transferred the toll stability fund to reduce the need for future toll rises. On 21 July 1993, the legislative council approved by 35 to 19 the amendment proposed by the Liberal Party.\n\nAny changes in tolls must be gazetted. The toll adjustment mechanism allows the franchisee to apply for an increase its tolls on six specified dates during the franchise period depending on revenues achieved. Toll increases and revenue appropriation according to following scenarii were envisaged: \n\nDue to severe congestion experienced at the Cross Harbour Tunnel and the feeder roads to the WHC, there have been calls for lower tolls at the Western Harbour Crossing by letting the Government of Hong Kong buy back the tunnel from the current owners of the tunnel, WHTCL, so that it can control tolls and ease traffic congestion in the Cross Harbour Tunnel area. To that end, lawmakers passed a non-binding motion in 2008 for the HK Government to address the situation. However the consultant hired by the Government to find a solution to the traffic problem did not suggest the Western Harbour Crossing have lower tolls. The consultants said that lowering tolls would result in a very high increase in traffic volume, with severe congestion on the exit to Route 4 (Hong Kong) during rush hour. This solution would only be possible when the construction of the Central-Wan Chai Bypass is completed.\n\n, there are 75 bus routes passing through the tunnel.\n\n"}

They are a particular type of plasma lamp, and one of the most modern. The technology was developed in the early 1990s, but, although it appeared initially to be very promising, sulfur lighting was a commercial failure by the late 1990s. Since 2005, lamps are again being manufactured for commercial use.\n\nThe sulfur lamp consists of a golf ball-sized (30 mm) fused-quartz bulb containing several milligrams of sulfur powder and argon gas at the end of a thin glass spindle. The bulb is enclosed in a microwave-resonant wire-mesh cage. A magnetron, much like the ones in home microwave ovens, bombards the bulb, via a waveguide, with 2.45 GHz microwaves. The microwave energy excites the gas to five atmospheres pressure, which in turn heats the sulfur to an extreme degree forming a brightly glowing plasma capable of illuminating a large area. Because the bulb heats considerably, it may be necessary to provide forced air cooling to prevent it from melting. The bulb is usually placed at the focus of a parabolic reflector to direct all the light in one direction.\n\nIt would be impossible to excite the sulfur using traditional electrodes since the sulfur would quickly react with and destroy any metallic electrode. A patent pending to employ coated electrodes is discussed in Future prospects below. The absence of electrodes allows for a much greater variety of light-generating substances to be used than those used in traditional lamps.\n\nThe design life of the bulb is approximately 60,000 hours. The design life of the magnetron has been improved by the Germany/England based Plasma International so it can also last for that same period.\n\nThe warm-up time of the sulfur lamp is notably shorter than for other gas discharge lamps, with the exception of fluorescent lamps, even at low ambient temperatures. It reaches 80% of its final luminous flux within 20 seconds, and the lamp can be restarted approximately five minutes after a power cut.\n\nThe first prototype lamps were 5.9 kW units, with a system efficiency of 80 lumens per watt. The first production models were 96.4 lumens per watt. Later models were able to eliminate the cooling fan and improve luminous efficacy to 100 lumens per watt.\n\nThe sulfur plasma consists mainly of dimer molecules (S), which generate the light through molecular emission. Unlike atomic emission, the emission spectrum is continuous throughout the visible spectrum. As much as 73% of the emitted radiation is in the visible spectrum, with a small amount in infrared energy and less than 1% in ultraviolet light.\n\nThe spectral output peaks at 510 nanometres, giving the light a greenish hue. The correlated color temperature is about 6,000 kelvins with a CRI of 79. The lamp can be dimmed to 15% without affecting the light quality.\n\nA magenta filter can be used to give the light a warmer feel. Such a filter was used on the lamps at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe addition of other chemicals in the bulb might improve color rendition. Sulfur lamp bulbs with calcium bromide (CaBr) added produce a similar spectrum plus a spike in red wavelengths at 625 nm. Other additives such as lithium iodide (LiI) and sodium iodide (NaI) can be used to modify the output spectra.\n\nThe technology was conceived by engineer Michael Ury, physicist Charles Wood and their colleagues in 1990. With support from the United States Department of Energy, it was further developed in 1994 by Fusion Lighting of Rockville, Maryland, a spinoff of the Fusion UV division of Fusion Systems Corporation. Its origins are in microwave discharge light sources used for ultraviolet curing in the semiconductor and printing industries. The Fusion UV division was later sold to Spectris plc, and the rest of Fusion Systems was later acquired by the Eaton Corporation.\n\nOnly two production models were developed, both with similar specifications: the Solar 1000 in 1994 and the Light Drive 1000 in 1997, which was a refinement of the previous model.\n\nProduction of these lamps ended in 1998. Fusion Lighting closed its Rockville, MD location in February 2003, after consuming approximately $90 million in venture capital. Their patents were licensed to the LG Group. The Internet Archive has a copy of Fusion Lighting's defunct website. Their lamps were installed in more than one hundred facilities worldwide, but many of them have already been removed.\n\nIn 2001, Ningbo Youhe New Lighting Source Co., Ltd, in Ningbo, China, produced its own sulfur lamp version. The company's website is no longer online and may be out of business, but information on these lamps is available from its archived copy at the Internet Archive.\n\nIn 2006, LG Electronics began production of its sulfur lamps, called Plasma Lighting System (PLS).\n\nCurrently, Sulfur lamps are being produced by Hive Lighting as the Wasp 1000. It can be identified by the mesh that surrounds the glass bulb.\n\nThe magnetrons in these lamps may cause electromagnetic interference in the 2.4 GHz wireless spectrum, which is used by Wi-Fi, cordless phones and satellite radio in North America. Fearing interference with their broadcasts, Sirius and XM satellite radio petitioned the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to force Fusion Lighting to reduce the electromagnetic emissions of their lamps by 99.9%. In 2001, Fusion Lighting agreed to install metal shielding around their lamps to reduce electromagnetic emissions by 95%.\n\nIn May 2003, the FCC terminated the proceeding that would have defined out-of-band emission limits for radio-frequency lights operating at 2.45 GHz, saying the record of the proceeding had become outdated and Fusion Lighting had stopped working on such lamps. The order concluded:\n\nUnlike fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps, sulfur lamps contain no mercury. Therefore, sulfur lamps do not pose a threat to the environment nor require special disposal. In addition, use of sulfur lamps has the potential to reduce the total amount of energy required for lighting.\n\nBecause the amount of light produced from one bulb is so great, it is usually necessary to distribute the light to areas far removed from the lamp. The most common method used is light pipes.\n\nThe 3M light pipe is a long, transparent, hollow cylinder with a prismatic surface developed by 3M that distributes the light uniformly over its length. Light pipes can be as long as and are assembled on site from shorter, modular units. The light pipe is attached to the parabolic reflector of the sulfur lamp. For shorter pipes, there will be a mirror at the opposite end; for longer ones, there will be a lamp at each end. The overall appearance of a light pipe has been compared to that of a giant-sized fluorescent tube. One sulfur lamp with a light pipe can replace dozens of HID lamps. In the National Air and Space Museum, three lamps, each with a pipe, replaced 94 HID lamps while greatly increasing the amount of light delivered.\n\nThe greatly reduced number of lamps may simplify maintenance and reduce installation costs but may also require a backup system for areas where lighting is critical. The light pipes allow the lamp to be placed in an easily accessible area for maintenance and away from places where the heat of the lamp may be a problem.\n\nA secondary reflector is a structure with a mirrored surface placed directly into the path of the beam of light as it exits the parabolic primary reflector of the lamp. A secondary reflector can have a complex geometry which allows it to break up the light and direct it to where it is desired. It can spotlight an object or spread out the light for general illumination.\n\nAt Sundsvall-Härnösand Airport near Sundsvall, Sweden, airfield lighting is provided by sulfur lamps mounted on towers 30 metres tall. The lamps are directed upward and shine their light onto wing-shaped secondary reflectors that spread the light out and direct it downward. In this way, one lamp can illuminate an area .\n\nAt the headquarters of DONG Energy, an energy company in Denmark, a single sulfur lamp directs its light onto numerous specular reflectors and diffusers to illuminate the entrance hall as well as several sculptures outside of the building.\n\nAt the entrance to University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, secondary reflectors on the ceiling are clad with highly reflective films, but shaped so as to avoid any glare. Moreover, since these films have a microprismatic surface structure that splits up the beams, the risk of glare problems is further reduced. The fact that the reflectors move the light source far away from the eye of anyone who would happen to look into them helps to further eliminate glare problems.\n\nIndirect fixtures direct most of their luminous flux upward toward a ceiling. A highly reflective ceiling can then serve as a secondary source of diffusive, low luminance, high visual quality lighting for interior spaces. The primary advantages of indirect lighting are the opportunity to significantly reduce indirect glare potential and to completely eliminate direct source viewing.\n\nAt the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) headquarters building, two sulfur lamps were installed in the tops of free-standing kiosks. The high ceiling was retrofit with high reflectance (90%), white acoustic ceiling tile. The lamps direct their light upward, and it is reflected off the ceiling providing indirect light. Narrow, medium, or wide beam patterns can be created by choosing various reflector elements.\n\nLight pipes would not be necessary in applications such as stadium lighting, where a plain fixture can be mounted high enough so that the light can spread over a large area. The installation at Hill Air Force Base contains lamps with light pipes as well as downlight fixtures mounted high in an aircraft hangar.\n\nOptical fibers have been studied as a distribution system for sulfur lamps, but no practical system has ever been marketed.\n\nSulfur lamps can be used as light sources in scientific instruments.\n\nThe development of an affordable, efficient, and long-lived microwave source is a technological hurdle to cost reduction and commercial success. The lamp prototypes were only available in high wattages (1000+ W), which impeded adoption in applications where light output demands were not great. The sulfur lamp has problems with the life of the magnetron and the motor that rotates the bulb and noise from the cooling fan. Because most sulfur lamps have moving parts, reliability remains a critical issue, and system maintenance may impede market adoption, however newer-design lamps which no longer require active cooling are commercially available.\nResearchers have had some success at eliminating the need to rotate the bulb by using circularly polarized microwaves to spin the plasma discharge instead. Other experiments have used sodium iodide, scandium iodide, indium monobromide (InBr), or tellurium as the light-generating medium.\n\nOn May 21, 2019 a US patent was awarded to glass scientist Anatoly Kishinevski and physicist Justin Herzig of the firm GlassThinkTank, for a sulfur plasma lamp using electrically conductive silicon carbide as the electrodes. A patent #20070075617 is pending since 2006 for a sulfur lamp \"with electrodes\" — in fact, a more traditional gas–discharge lamp where a magnetron is not required. Various electrode coatings are suggested to combat high chemical activity of sulfur. As usual with patents, though, only commercial applications will reveal whether this design is viable.\n\nMany of the installations of the lamps were for testing purposes only, but there remain a few sites where the lamps are in use as the primary lighting source. Perhaps the most visible of these would be the glass atria in the National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040853", "title": "Silverleaf whitefly", "text": "Silverleaf whitefly\n\nThe silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci, also informally referred to as the sweet potato whitefly) is one of several species of whitefly that are currently important agricultural pests. A review in 2011 concluded that the silverleaf whitefly is actually a species complex containing at least 24 morphologically indistinguishable species.\n\nThe silverleaf whitefly thrives worldwide in tropical, subtropical, and less predominately in temperate habitats. Cold temperatures kill both the adults and the nymphs of the species. The silverleaf whitefly can be confused with other insects such as the common fruitfly, but with close inspection, the whitefly is slightly smaller and has a distinct wing color that helps to differentiate it from other insects.\n\nWhile the silverleaf whitefly had been known in the United States since 1896, in the mid-1980s a virulent strain appeared in poinsettia crops in Florida. For convenience that strain was referred to as strain B (biotype B), to distinguish it from the milder infestation of the earlier known strain A. Less than a year after its identification, strain B was found to have moved to tomatoes, and other fruit and vegetable crops. Within five years, the silverleaf whitefly had caused over $100 million in damage to Texas and California agriculture industries.\n\nFemale \"B. tabaci\" will lay 50 to 400 eggs ranging from 0.10 mm - 0.25 mm on the under part of leaves. Female whiteflies are diploid and emerge from fertilized eggs whereas male whiteflies are haploid and emerge from unfertilized eggs. Eggs are laid in groups, being small in size with dimensions of 0.2 mm wide and 0.1 mm in height. Eggs are initially whitish in color and change to a brown color near hatching, within 5 to 7 days. After hatching, the whitefly nymph develops through four instar stages.\nThe first instar, commonly called a crawler, is the only mobile nymphal stage. The first instar nymph can grow to about 0.3 mm and is greenish in color and flat in body structure. The mobile nymph walks to find a suitable area on the leaf with adequate nutrients and molts into an immobile stage. The next three instars remain in place for 40–50 days, until molting into an adult. Silver exuvia, or shed skins are left on the leaves. The immobile instars appear opaquely white. Nymphs feed by stabbing into the plant with their mouth-parts and sucking up plant juices. After the fourth instar, the nymph transforms into a pupal stage where the eyes become a deep red color, the body color becomes yellow, and the body structure thickens. This is not a true pupal stage, as is found in the Endopterygota, but is similar in function. Adult whiteflies are approximately four times the size of the egg, with light yellow bodies and white wings, which is attributed by the secretion of wax across its wings and body. Adult silverleaf whiteflies can reach up to 0.9 mm in length. While feeding or resting the whitefly adult folds its wings tent-like over its body.\n\nResearch indicates that the silverleaf whitefly likely came from India. Since the whitefly is predominately associated with areas exhibiting tropical/subtropical climates, the focus shifts to how these insects attained access to crops in habitats with temperate climates. One hypothesis suggests that the transfer of decorative plants from tropical regions may have aided in the spread of the silverleaf whiteflies to temperate environments. The ability of the whitefly to adapt to various plants facilitates the spread of dangerous plant viruses, which these insects are notorious for transmitting. Plants which are affected by the whitefly include: tomatoes, squash, poinsettia, cucumber, eggplants, okra, beans, and cotton. Other common plant damages of whitefly include: removing plant sap, breakdown of the leaves of the plant, and leaf shedding.\n\nThe silverleaf whitefly is considered an invasive species in the United States as well as Australia, Africa, and several European countries. It was classified as an agricultural pest in Greece around 1889 and had a significant impact on tobacco crops there. The first silverleaf whitefly was found in the United States in 1897 on a crop of sweet potatoes.\n\nThis tiny insect causes damage to plants through feeding and transmitting plant diseases. The silverleaf whitefly feeds on its host plants by piercing the phloem or lower leaf surfaces with its mouth and removing nutrients. Affected areas of the plant may develop chlorotic spots, whither, or drop leaves. Whiteflies also produce a sticky substance called honeydew, which is left behind on the host. Honeydew can induce the growth of sooty molds, which can then reduce the plants ability to absorb light. This results in slower growth, lower yield, and poor quality plants. It also requires that crops be thoroughly washed after harvesting, which raises processing costs for the grower.\n\nThe silverleaf whitefly is also a notorious vector for plant disease. It has transmitted gemniviruses including lettuce infectious yellows virus, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, and African cassava mosaic virus for years and over many continents and is now a vector for cassava brown streak virus disease.\n\n\"Bemisia tabaci\" became a serious issue in crops across the southwestern United States and Mexico in the 1980s. Scientists speculate that this pest was introduced via infested ornamental plants brought into the United States at this time. Florida's poinsettia greenhouses were crippled by the pest beginning in 1986, and by 1991, the infestation had spread through Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona to plague growers in California. California produces approximately 90% of the United States’ winter vegetable crop, and has incurred an estimated $500 million in crop damage due to silverleaf whitefly populations. Across the agricultural industry, this pest is thought to cost the state $774 million in private sector plant sales, 12,540 jobs, and $112.5 million in personal income. On a national scale, the United States has suffered crop and ornamental plant damages in excess of $1 billion.\n\nThis species of whitefly is a particularly devastating pest because it feeds on over 500 plant species. Common hosts are agricultural crops including tomatoes, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, melons, cotton, carrots, sweet potato, cucumber, and pumpkin, and ornamental plants such as poinsettia, crepe myrtle, garden roses, lantana, and lilies. It can cause specific damage to certain host plants, like \"silverleaf\" on squash, irregular ripening of tomatoes, whitestalk in broccoli and cauliflower, white stem in poinsettia, and light root in carrots.\n\nMultiple methods of control can be used to combat these prevalent agricultural pests. Some major control methods include, application of oils, use of natural enemies such as Aphelinidae parasitoids, employment of trap crops, release of insect growth regulators, and implementation of traps.\n\nMost of these control tools have a minimal effect on plant and soil properties. Scientists are currently focusing on targeting the whitefly through mechanisms that do not cause pollution or contamination (i.e., mechanisms other than insecticides). It is important to be able to reduce the number of \"B. tabaci\" individuals that settle on plants to decrease plant damages such as those caused by viral transmissions. This can be accomplished by reducing settling, decreasing oviposition, and abating population development.\n\nClassical biological control has been the best long-term, sustainable solution to controlling these exotic pests. However, success of this method can be unpredictable.\n\nEntomologists with the U.S. Arid-Land Agricultural Research Center identified the most common causes of death of the whitefly as predation by other insects, parasitism, and weather induced dislodgement. They emphasize the importance of exploiting the use of natural predators and have identified predators by the use of enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). It was found that the use of the biological controls and insect growth regulators produces a higher predator-to-prey ratio. Insect growth regulators, such as buprofezin and pyriproxyfen, conserve natural predators compared to conventional insecticides, which can indiscriminately kill both predator and pest populations.\n\nPredators, parasitoids, and pathogens specific to whiteflies can keep populations under control.\n\nSpecies in eight arthropod orders are known to be predators \"B. tabaci.\" These include members of the families Phytoseiidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Anthocoridae, Nabidae, and Miridae, Chrysopidae and Coniopterygidae. There are currently four species of predators that are commercially available for control of \"B. tabaci:\" \"Delphastus pusillus,\" \"Macrolophus caliginosus,\" \"Chrysoperla carnea,\" and \"C. rufilabris\". \"D. pusillus\" is a species of small, shiny, black beetle which sucks out the contents of the silverleaf whitefly by piercing its exoskeleton. Adult and larval stages of this beetle feed on all life stages of the pest. \"C. rufilabris\" is only able to feed on the immature stages or the larval stages of \"B. tabaci\".\n\nAnother natural enemy of the whitefly are parasitoids, which kill their host once their development has been completed. Parasitoids in the families Platygasteridae, Aphelinidae, and Eulophidae are known to attack whiteflies. Establishment of several Old World species of \"Eretmocerus\" wasps has been attempted in the Western United States to control \"B. tabaci\". However, differences in climate preference by these wasps reduced their effect. The best studied of these whitefly parasitoids are \"Encarsia formosa\" and \"Eretmocerus eremicus\", both of which are commercially available. The \"Encarsia formosa\" \"Beltsville Strain\", however, has been unsuccessful in control \"B. tabaci\" biotype B in commercial greenhouses; it is only able to control the species in small experimental greenhouses. The species \"Encarsia formosa\" works much better at controlling the whitefly species \"Trialeurodes vaporariorum\" than it does \"B. tabaci\". \"Eretmocerus sp.\" has been found more successful at \"B. tabaci\" than the \"E. formosa\" \"Beltsville Strain.\" The wasps are faster at searching for patches of host nymphs are consistent at controlling the population. A variable release strategy of parasitoids has been found successfully able to control populations of \"B. tabaci\". This was done by releasing six female parasitoids per week for the first half of the growing season, and only one female per week for the remaining of the season. This improved the effectiveness of the parasitoid wasps by ensuring they were continuously available to attack the pests, but in numbers that reflected the shrinking population of pests. If natural enemies are not able to control the pest population at low levels due to a significant increase in pest, an insecticide compatible with the biological control agent could be used to assist in reducing the pest population to low levels again.\n\nAnother natural mechanism of controlling the population of \"B. tabaci\" is the use of fungal pathogens. The most commonly known pathogens to the whitefly pest are \"Paecilomyces fumosoroseus\", \"Aschersonia aleyrodis\", \"Verticillium lecanii\", and \"Beauveria bassiana\". When spore solutions of \"V. lecanii\" are sprayed on eggs of \"B. tabaci\" approximately 89% to 90% of these eggs are killed. Some strains of whitefly have developed resistance to its fungal pathogens including \"V. lecanii\".\n\"B. bassiana\" is only an effective biological control agent in conditions of low temperatures (maximum of 20 °C) and a humidity level greater than 96%. Not enough studies have been conducted to show the productiveness of fungal pathogen in the real world environment. Much of the success of this biological control on \"B. tabaci\" has been conducted in the laboratory. However, it can be concluded though that when the fungal pathogen is combined with an insecticide, the synergistic effect of the two will induce a higher mortality rate of the whitefly. \"P. fumosoroseus\" has a broad host range but can attack silverleaf whiteflies at a variety of life stages and these include eggs, nymphs, pupae, and adults stages. On the other hand, \"A. aleyrodis\" only infects and destroys nymphs and pupae.\n\nNatural oils are another important tool in the control of \"B. tabaci.\" Currently, the most effective oil in the market is the ultra-fine oil, which is a paraffinic oil product that reduces the settlement of the adult flies, decreases oviposition, and abates the transmission of the tomato yellow leaf curl virus. The effect of ultra-fine oil can be strengthened through the combination with oils such as limonene or citronellal. Olive oil is also highly effective in controlling the number of whiteflies. Other natural oils such as cottonseed, castor, peanut, soybean, and sunflower can be effective. Peanut oil was the most effective out of this group in reducing the population. All of these oils cause direct mortality to immature life stages of the silverleaf whitefly on contact and reduce settling and ovipositon by adults when sprayed on plant leaves. The oil extracted from the seeds of sugar apple has also been found effective against the whitefly. This oil causes the silverleaf whitefly nymph to shrink in size and therefore detach from the tomato plant, leading to starvation. Sugar apple seed oil is not phytotoxic to tomato plants of any concentrations and reduces the survival rate of the pest.\n\nInsecticides can be costly, and have an increasing risk of resistance by whiteflies. However, the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen has been found successful in reducing whitefly populations on curbit plants including zucchini squash, cucumber, and pumpkin. This hormone is a juvenile hormone analogue, which affects hormonal balance and chitin in immature insects, and causes deformation and death during molting and pupation. This insect growth regulator does not kill adult whiteflies, and has low toxicity to mammals, fish, birds and bumblebees.\n\nTraps offer a pesticide free method of control of \"B. tabaci.\" The Light-Emitting Diode Equipped CC trap (LED-CC) was developed by plant physiologist Chang-Chi Chu and Thomas Henneberry. Originally, the trap was used to monitor population of silverleaf whitefly populations, but as the trap was improved it was used in control programs to limit whitefly pest populations. The trap itself includes a green LED light that attracts and traps the whiteflies. The LED device works best at night, and is inexpensive and durable. In addition, the LED is does not harm predators and parasitoids of the whitefly.\n\nAnother technique used to reduce virus damage include the use of floating row covers, which are covers used to keep plants from exposure from pests. Field studies conducted in Australia have shown that the use of floating row covers coupled with insect growth regulators increase the yield of harvested fruit and quality and reduce virus damage to cucurbits\".\"\n\nAnother important control is the use of other crops as a source of trap crops. Squashes can act as trap crops for the silverleaf whitefly due to the flies’ attraction to these crops. Silverleaf whiteflies are actually more attracted to the squash crop than they are to the tomato plant. When squash serves as a trap crop, the tomato yellow curl leaf virus can be controlled and limited. Scientific experiments show in the fields that growing squash crops around the areas where tomato plants can be found is a useful manipulation in regulating the silverleaf whitefly population as well as the transmission of TYLCV. Other plants that can serve as trap crops include cantaloupe and cucumber.\n\nThrough a cultural control method, different planting areas can limit the amount of \"B. tabaci\" infected plants. Planting different host crops away from each other will decrease the number of plants the flies will be able to infect. Thus, the best control is to maximize the distance and time interval between host crops. Good sanitation in winter and spring crops is also required for the maintenance and control of the fly population. Weeds and host crop residues must be removed immediately to avoid infestation. Silver/aluminum cover mulches can repel the adult silverleaf whitefly. Thus, when planting seeds, placing a reflective polyethylene mulch on planting beds will significantly reduce the rate of colonization.\n\nCultural controls are very important to crops such as vegetables and fruit. For example, in the family Cucurbitaceae, vegetables such as watermelon and squash contract squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV) by the silverleaf whitefly. The SqVYV virus discovered by plant pathologist Benny Bruton and Shaker Kousik is essentially a crippling disease of the watermelon, which leads to the vine of the watermelon to collapse, causing the death of the watermelon before harvest. Kousik and pathologist Scott Adkins at ARS Subtropical Plant Pathology Research Unit worked together in screening the watermelon germplasm for resistance to SqVYV as to search for potential sources of resistance in wild-type watermelon. Kousik examined different combinations of insecticides and silver plastic mulch that could be used to reduce the whitefly populations.\n\n"}

Axle load is an important design consideration in the engineering of roadways and railways, as both are designed to tolerate a maximum weight-per-axle (axle load); exceeding the maximum rated axle load will cause damage to the roadway or rail tracks.\n\nOn railways, a given section of track is designed to support a maximum axle load. The maximum axle load is determined by weight of rails, density of sleepers and fixtures, train speeds, amount of ballast, and strength of bridges and earthworks. Because track and especially the rails, are expensive it is important to know axle load that a stretch of track can support. If the track is overloaded by trains that are too heavy, it can be damaged. Higher operating speeds can be achieved through reduced axle loads and increased density of sleepers.\n\nThe standard rail weight for British railways is now . Before the 1990s, most diesel locomotives were built to a maximum axle load of so the maximum locomotive weight was for a four-axle locomotive and for a six-axle one. Higher axle loads are now permitted, e.g. the Class 67 locomotive is a four-axle machine weighing , giving on each axle.\n\nThe Fortescue Railway uses rail on concrete sleepers and has a maximum axle load of , which is the highest axle load of any railway in the world in 2016. In 2011, it was proposed to increase the axle load of the railway to \n\nThe absolute maximum axle load for railways depends on the rail used, above the indicated load the rails will start to bend between sleepers and can cause de-railment.\n\nBridges may have to carry several locomotives or wagons at the same time, especially for longer spans. They require separate calculation of maximum allowable axle load, and a weak bridge may limit the axle load of the full line. Theodore Cooper developed the E10 loading system for calculating the strength of bridges.\n\nThe term axle load is also applicable to trucks which is complicated by the fact that trucks may have more than two wheels per axle. In this case, the axle load remains the same, but the load borne by the individual wheels is reduced by having more contact area (more wheels, larger tires, lower tire pressure) to distribute the load.\n\n\n"}

It is a mountainous, midland province with a natural land area of 3534.45 square kilometres and a population of 1,149,100 as of 2008. Its multi-ethnic society is composed of eight ethnic groups.\n\nWith its rich mineral resources and salubrious climate, the province offers significant opportunities for industrial development for both domestic and foreign investors. Thái Nguyên is also known as an educational centre and ranks 3rd nationwide, having 21 universities and colleges. The province is also the centre of tea industry in the country with an area of 16,000 ha. (second only to Lâm Đồng) with a production of 100,000 tonnes/year. Its dried tea production is 25,000 tonnes/year. The tea produced here is considered to have the finest quality throughout Vietnam.\n\nThe province's name was derived from Sino-Vietnamese .\n\nThái Nguyên borders six provinces: Bắc Kạn, Vĩnh Phúc, Tuyên Quang, Lạng Sơn, Bắc Giang, Hanoi. Thái Nguyên also borders the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi to the south. Thái Nguyên is the gateway for socio-economic exchange with the Red River delta. The exchange is carried out via road, rail and waterways in the province Main water features include the Công River and Núi Cốc Lake.\n\nThái Nguyên has many mountain ranges running from south to north. The structure of them is made of strongly decayed rocks with many caves and valleys. In the southwest is the Tam Đảo mountain range, located on the northern fringe of the Red River Delta. The range spans some 80 kilometres, with its highest peak of 1,529 metres (note other sources state 1,590 or 1,592 metres) and many cliffs running from northwest to southeast.\n\nThe Tam Đảo mountain region is protected by the Tam Đảo National Park, established in 1996, which is one of the largest national parks in the country. There are over 20 peaks with the park area, others of note include Thien Thi at 1,375 m, Thach Ban at 1,388 m and Phu Nghia at 1,300 m. Sharp peaks with sloping sides and numerous, deep partitions are characteristic of the topology. The boundary of the national park is located at an altitude of 100 m around the Tam Đảo range. There is a larger buffer zone (which has area of approximately 535 km) which surrounds the national park which has an altitude below 100 m. Seventy per cent of the area of the park is covered by natural and artificial forest. The natural forest is about 220 km and the human altered forest is about 30 km\n\nThere are two other mountain ranges in the province, both running in a northwest-southeast direction; the Ngan Son range running from Bắc Kạn to Võ Nhai District and the Bac Son range. Many of the mountains of Thái Nguyên Province provide shelter for a considerable part from monsoon winds.\n\nWith terrain sloping from high mountains to the low zones and midlands, in terms temperature in winter, Thái Nguyên has three climatic sub-zones. A cold sub-zone in Võ Nhai District, a temperate subzone including Định Hóa, Phú Lương and southern Võ Nhai districts and a warm subzone which includes Đại Từ, Đồng Hỷ, Phú Bình, Phổ Yên districts, Thái Nguyên City and Sông Côngtown.\n\nThe average temperatures in the hottest and the coldest months are 28.9 °C in June and 15.2 °C in January. The lowest recorded is 13.7 °C. Total number of sunny hours in a year is ranges between 1,300 and 1,750, which is equally distributed for months in a year. The climate of Thái Nguyên has two distinct seasons: the rainy season from May to October and dry season from October to May. The average rainfall per annum lies in the range of 2,000 to 2,500 mm; it rains most in August and least in January. Generally speaking, Thái Nguyên's climate is favourable for developing agriculture and forestry.\n\nThe total land area is and can be divided into three classes. Mountainous land accounts for 48.4% area and is formed from the decaying of magma, rocks and sedimentary rock. Hilly land accounts for 31.4% area and is made of condensed sand, clay and ancient alluvia. Hill land in some places such as Đại Từ, Phú Lương is 120 to 200 metres high and more with a sloping gradient of 5° to 20° and is an ideal place for planting industrial crops and perennial fruit trees. Field land accounts 12.4%, a part of which is scattered along streams and can be easily exposed to severe meteorological conditions (such as sudden floods and droughts) and is difficult to harvest. Of the total land area, 2,207.89 km (65.22% of natural area) are used and 1,096.69 km (30.78% of natural area) are unused. Of unused land area, only 17.14 km area is cultivable; bare land and deserted hills occupy 412.5 km. A major problem faced by Thái Nguyên Province is to recover deserted areas.\n\nThái Nguyên is subdivided into 9 district-level sub-divisions:\n\n\nThey are further subdivided into 13 commune-level towns (or townlets), 142 communes, and 25 wards. Of the 180 total communes within the province, only 125 of them are within highland and mountainous regions; the rest are within plains and midlands regions.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam, the population of Thái Nguyên province as on 2008 was 1,149,100 with a density of 325 persons per km over a total land area of of the province. The male population during this period was 562,900 with females accounting for 586,200. The rural population was 871300 against an urban population of 277800 (31.88% of the total population).\n\nThere are many ethnic groups in Thái Nguyên Province, of which eight main ethnic groups are Kinh, Tày, Nùng, Sán Dìu, H'Mông, Sán Chay, Dao, and Hoa. Demographic distribution varies greatly: population density in the highlands and mountainous regions is low, while that of urban areas is very high. Vo Nhai District has lowest population density with 72 inhabitants/km and Thái Nguyên city has the highest with 1,260 inhabitants/km.\n\nFarming, aquaculture and industries are some of the important economic activities of the province. In 2008, as against the national figure of 7,592 cooperatives of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery cooperatives, there are only 83 agriculture cooperatives in the province. There were 638 farms as against the national number of 120,699 in 2008. The output value of agriculture produce at constant 1994 prices in the province was 1667.1 billion đồngs against the national value of 156681.9 billion đồngs.\nThe province produced 410,400 tonnes of cereals as against the national production of 43.68 million tonnes. The per capita production of cereals in the province was 356.9 kg as against the national figure of 501.9 kg in 2007. In 2007, the industrial output of the province was a meagre 11,987.5 Bhilldongs against the national output of 1.47 million Bhilldongs.\n\nThe economy of the province is largely dictated by its capital city, Thái Nguyên, which is the fastest growing city of North Vietnam. The city is the gateway to northwest Vietnam. It is famous for its tree plantations. Its historical importance is due to the fact that Ho Chi Minh resided here in the Phu Dinh village of Dinh Hoa district when he planned \"Dien Bien Phu\". Before he moved to Hanoi, he came here from Tan Trao and declared independence. The city is also the centre of heavy industries of northern Vietnam. Thái Nguyên Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), which is located in Thái Nguyên city, is one of Vietnam's top 20 state-owned companies, and has made a sizable contribution to Vietnam's economy. The city is located on the bank of the Cầu River has a geographical area of approximately and its population was 228,064 in 2005.\n\nNúi Cốc reservoir is 25 km west of Thái Nguyên city. It covers an area of with deep waters that can store 175 million cubic metres. The lake waters feeds an irrigation canal and a small hydroelectric power station with three units of 630 KW capacity each, for a total output of about 2 GWh. The irrigation system was built in 1977. However, the power plant construction on the irrigation canal was started in Jan 2008 and the plant commissioned in Jan 2010. A 22 kV transmission line carries the power to a nearby grid.\n\nTwo railway lines serve Thái Nguyên Province, and particularly the city of Thái Nguyên. The first line connects Hanoi Railway Station to Quán Triều Railway Station (Quán Triều Ward), and the second connects Lưu Xá Railway Station (Phú Xá Ward) to Hạ Long Railway Station, Hạ Long, via a railway junction at Kép in Bắc Giang Province. Both lines were built after the First Indochina War; unlike most railway lines in Vietnam, which were established in metre gauge, the Luu Xa–Hạ Long line was built at standard gauge, and the Hanoi–Quán Triều line was built at mixed gauge. The rail spur connecting Luu Xa and Kép was a strategic line constructed between October 1965 and December 1966 by a railroad engineering division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who operated in North Vietnam repairing railway lines at the request of Ho Chi Minh.\n\nThere are several tourist attractions in the province. Some of the ones outside the capital city are listed below.\n\nNúi Cốc Lake is the most popular attraction. Tour boats circle the lake, recounting local legends and visiting some of the 89 islands within it. Several islands feature historic remains, protected breeding sites for birds, or feral goats. In March 2007, an eco-tourism park was developed beside the lake. It features musical fountains, an animal park, and a Fairy Tale House Underworld and Water park.\n\nPhuong Hoang (Phoenix) cave is one of the largest caves in Vietnam, located at a distance of 40 km from Thái Nguyên city. The cave has four chambers where stalagmite and stalactite formations can be seen. Two of the caves admit some sunlight when the sun is at the right angle. Otherwise, artificial light is required to see the Hisinterior.\n\nHistorical Safe Zone (An toàn khu - ATK) locates in Định Hóa district. This was the place where president Ho Chi Minh had lived for several years in The Resistance War against France (1945 -1954)\n\nBesides its famous tea, the province is known for such local culinary specialties as bún chả and phở noodle dishes, Định Hóa rice, Dầy cake, and hill chicken. But its most famous food is Bánh chưng from Bờ Đậu village about 10 km north of Thái Nguyên City in Phú Lương District, where both sides of the road are lined with shops selling the local specialty made from glutinous rice cake, mung bean puree, and pork wrapped in aromatic leaves (usually \"Stachyphrynium placentarium\", sometimes banana) and tied up with string made from a kind of bamboo, which can be used to slice the rice cake into portions for sharing. Tết is the village's busiest season. \n\n"}

It is located entirely within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. It is the second highest summit in the Jemez after Chicoma Mountain. It is the most visually prominent peak in the range when viewed from the south, for example, from Albuquerque. From many other directions it is less prominent or not visible, due to its location in the center of the Valles Caldera, well away from the Caldera's rim.\n\nRedondo Peak is an example of the volcanic feature known as a resurgent dome. It was formed some time after the main caldera-forming eruptions of about 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago, but it is not itself an eruptive feature. The summit of the mountain is composed of tuff ejected by the more recent caldera-forming eruption, rather than of subsequent volcanic ejecta. It is forested all the way to its summit. Controversy concerning logging practices on the mountain contributed pressure to create the Valles Caldera National Preserve, within which logging is restricted.\n\nRedondo Peak is sacred to various Pueblo peoples of New Mexico and, as a result, hiking and other recreational activities on the mountain are sharply restricted as of 2008. The summit area is occupied by a shrine that was studied and excavated by anthropologist William Boone Douglass in the early 20th century and remained in use well into the 20th century. The shrine and its immediate surroundings are closed to visitors.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040879", "title": "Cartmanland", "text": "Cartmanland\n\n\"Cartmanland\" is the sixth episode of the fifth season of the animated television series \"South Park\", and the 71st episode of the series overall. \"Cartmanland\" originally aired in the United States on July 25, 2001 on Comedy Central.\n\nIn the episode, Cartman inherits one million dollars from his grandmother. He uses it to purchase his own amusement park, named \"Cartmanland\". The resulting success causes Kyle to have a hemorrhoid and lose his faith in God. However, Kyle later regains his faith in God when Cartman loses his theme park and owes $13,000 back in taxes.\n\nCartman's grandmother, Mabel Louise Cartman passes away and leaves Cartman one million dollars in inheritance. Rather than invest the money or donate it to Goodwill, Cartman instead uses the money to purchase North Park Funland, an amusement park owned by Frank Fun. Signing off the deeds, Frank however clears his conscience with Cartman, revealing that Funland has been a financial failure. Cartman reassures him that he only intends to open the park for himself, expressing his disdain for park lines. Frank agrees to sell, and the park is renamed Cartmanland.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle upon learning of Cartman's success starts to question his faith in God, and how someone as horrible as Cartman could be so fortunate and happy. To make matters worse, Kyle develops a hemorrhoid due to the stress of knowing Cartman's glee. He and Stan attempt to sneak into Cartmanland, defying Cartman's expulsion of any guests; especially them. Kyle's hemorrhoid pops whilst climbing over the fence into the park and are then found by Cartman who angrily sends them away. The hemorrhoid becomes infected, worsening Kyle's state and being the final straw to fully lose faith in God. Desperate to rekindle hope in Kyle, his parents attempt to cheer him up by telling the story of Job. The plan backfires however, as Kyle is horrified that God would allow such a devout believer in him to suffer so greatly \"just to win a bet with Satan\".\n\nCartman hires a single security guard to stop further trespassing into his park. The guard refuses to work unless he is afforded a viable salary; but Cartman has just spent the last of his inheritance. The guard points out that if Cartman lets in two people to the park per day, he could easily pay for his employment. Eventually, one of the rides malfunctions, forcing Cartman to let more guests in to pay for maintenance crew. Inevitably, expenses for maintenance, refreshments, utilities and security mount up causing more and more guests to be admitted into the park, which turns out to revive the park as a success at Cartman's disdain for queues. Business experts mistake Cartman's \"you can't come\" technique as a marketing ploy - which proves to be fatal for Kyle, who flat lines. With Cartmanland a thriving success with record numbers of park guests, Cartman becomes infuriated and demands his money back from Mr. Fun. With the park back in Frank's ownership, the IRS collects $500,000 in taxes and penalty fees from Cartman as he did not keep tax records of the park. Another $500,000 is taken in a lawsuit by Kenny's parents after Kenny died on one of the rollercoasters, with $13,000 more going to pay for the former's legal fees. Now deep in debt and completely broken, Cartman pleads to get the park back from Mr. Fun, who ultimately refuses.\n\nUpon hearing about the events, Stan hurries to the hospital as Kyle is now on the verge of dying. He pleads with the doctor to take Kyle out of the hospital to show him what is happening to Cartman. They arrive at the park to find Cartman throwing rocks at the walls in anger over having lost his fortune before being maced by the security guard he originally hired. Seeing Cartman's misery causes Kyle's hemorrhoid to miraculously shrink away and he makes a full recovery as he watches Cartman have an emotional breakdown, restoring his faith in God.\n\nIn the DVD commentary to this episode, Parker and Stone highlight it as another example (after \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\") of the show's change in style towards simpler ideas which consisted only of an A-Plot, with no subplot, and \"not try[ing] to do too many things at once\". Parker mentions that they almost did not make the episode as they did not believe that there was enough going on in the episode, that it was too \"basic and easy\". Parker also said they were concerned that the story of Cartman inheriting a million dollars and buying a theme park was cliché. However, as it was the middle of the run and they had no other stories ready for production, they decided to run with the idea. Parker said he realised while they were making the episode that \"as long as you have the basic easy cliché thing as the overall thing, then you can get into the scenes and have a lot of fun with scenes and get original in there.\"\n\nBoth this episode and \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" appear on \"The Cult of Cartman\" DVD.\n\nThe security guard whom Cartman hires and who uses pepper spray was previously the lead mall cop in the season four episode \"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\". He is also featured in the 2014 \"South Park\" video game \"\" as the first boss the player must face, guarding Token Black's mansion and using his pepper spray on the player character unless they wear a gas mask.\n\n\"Cartmanland\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n\n"}

Roosevelt's New Deal, he worked for the Railroad Retirement Board in Washington, D.C. From there he found employment in the Federal Coordinator of Transport, the United States Tariff Commission and the Labor Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration. During World War II, Silverman was civilian Chief of Analysis and Plans to the Assistant Chief of the Army Air Forces Air Staff for Material and Service, assigned to the Pentagon. Silverman allegedly supplied documents from the Pentagon to the Silvermaster group of Soviet spies. Silverman knew Greg Silvermaster to be a conduit for Communist Party USA General secretary, Earl Browder.\n\nIn 1941, Silverman was on loan to the US Treasury Department and worked for a period of time on the frozen funds policy. Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury Harry Dexter White used Silverman to supply documents to Soviet intelligence in the latter part of 1942 and early 1943. Presidential Assistant Lauchlin Currie furnished Silverman with oral information, including information that the United States was on the verge of breaking Soviet codes. Irving Kaplan of the War Production Board was also giving Silverman information to be transmitted to the Soviet Union. As the war progressed, the volume of material increased. Silverman worked closely with Lud Ullman, who also worked at the Pentagon and did the photographing of stolen documents prior to being turned over to the Golos network.\n\nIn August 1945 Silverman left the Pentagon to work for the French Supply Council in Washington D.C., an office of the new French government.\n\nSilverman and Silvermaster learned much about U.S. policies and about Lauchlin Currie and Harry Dexter White's own views through their association. Currie appears to have been involved in carrying out orders from President Roosevelt to get U.S. intelligence services to return Soviet cryptographic documents to the Soviet Union and to cease decoding operations.\n\nThe code name \"Aileron\" appears in the Venona project and was identified as Silverman.

It is 153 km (95 mi) east of Hanoi. The province is home to Hạ Long Bay, a World Heritage Site. The provincial capital is Hạ Long. Nearly 80% of the province is mountainous with abundant land, forest water and mineral resources. Nearly 90% of coal output in the country is extracted in this province. Hạ Long Bay has 1,969 islands, out of which 989 have been given names. The province covers an area of \n6,102.4 square kilometres and as of 2014 it had a population of 1,185,200 people.\n\nThe name of Quảng Ninh province is the compound name of two provinces: \"Quảng Yên\" and \"Hải Ninh\" according to the naming of President Ho Chi Minh.\n\nQuảng Ninh is a land of rich history. In Hạ Long Bay area has archaeological remains of prehistoric people from 3000 to 1500 BC. This period is characterized as Hạ Long culture with many archaeological shells used as jewelry and money exchange, ancient animal bones, and human bones.\n\nThis land of Quảng Ninh is one of the 15 tribes of Văn Lang State.\n\nQuảng Ninh area has had several names:\nThe historic sites of Quảng Ninh Province:\n\nAfter the invasion of occupied Tonkin, in 1899 the French part Quảng Yên established Hải Ninh province.

According to the setting of Ho Chi Minh, the name of the province is the name of two transplant Quảng Yên and Hải Ninh old. The area of the province of Quảng Ninh is 8,239.243 km ².\n\nThe province has the shape of an oblique rectangle inclined in a northeast-to-southwest direction. To the west, the province borders an extended forest and mountain region. To the east, it is adjacent to the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. It features a meandering coastline, estuaries and tidal flats and more than 2,000 large and small islands. Exactly 1,030 of these have been named. Quảng Ninh's coordinates are longitude 106º25′ to 108º25′ east and latitude 20º40′ to 21º40′ north. Its width from east to west is 195 km (at the widest part).\n\nThe length from north to south of the province is 102 km. The northernmost point is in a mountain range at Mo Toòng village (Hoành Mô Commune, Bình Liêu District). The southernmost point is in Hạ Mai Island (Ngọc Vừng Commune, Vân Đồn District). The westernmost point is in Vàng Chua River (Bình Dương and Nguyễn Huệ communes, Đông Triều District). The easternmost point is inland at Got Cape, northeast of Trà Cổ Commune, Móng Cái Town.\n\nQuảng Ninh has a common international border with the People's Republic of China. Inland, north of province (Bình Liêu, Hải Hà districts) and Móng Cái borders Dongxing City and Fangcheng County in Guangxi Province, PRC with the borderline of 170 km. To the east, it adjuncts to Bắc Bộ Gulf. The province also borders Lạng Sơn, Bắc Giang and Hải Dương provinces to the west, and the city of Hải Phòng to the south. The coastal line is 250 km. The total area of Quảng Ninh is 8,239.243 km², of which 5,938 km² is mainland. The area of islands, bays and sea is a tremendous 2,448.853 km². The total area of the islands is 619.913 km².\n\nQuảng Ninh is a mountainous and coastal province, with more than 80 per cent of its area being made up of mountains and hills. The 2,000 some islands are also considered mountains. The mountainous zone can be divided into two parts: the eastern mountainous region extending from Tiên Yên through Bình Liêu, Hải Hà, Đầm Hà and Móng Cái; and the western zone ranging from Tiên Yên through Ba Chẽ and Hoành Bồ, north of Uông Bí Town. The former is a continuation of the Thâp Van Đai Son range in China. There are two main chains: Quảng Nam Châu 1,507 m and Cao Xiêm 1,330 m. The western zone features smooth and curved mountains called Đông Triều with Yên Tu Mount 1,068 m in Uông Bí region and Am Váp Mount 1,094 m in Hoành Bồ District.\n\nThe midland and coastal plains include a low range of hills weathered by both wind and water; forming fields and river basins. They include the zones of Đông Triêu, Uông Bí, northern Yên Hưng, southern Tiên Yên, Hải Hà and some of Móng Cái. In the estuaries, alluvial soil is deposited, creating low tidal flats. This can be found in the areas of southern Uông Bí, southern Yên Hưng (Hà Nam Island), eastern Yên Hưng, Đông Rui (Tiên Yên), southern Đầm Hà and Mong Cai, southeastern Hải Hà. The midlands and plains of the coastline are extremely favourable for agriculture and transport. It has become a densely populated area.\n\nThe sea and island zone of Quảng Ninh has a unique terrain. There are more than 2,000 islands, making up two thirds of the country's islands. They extend along the coast for more than 250 km and divide into numerous layers. The largest islands are Cái Bầu and Bản Sen, while the smallest are just like rocks in a garden. Vân Đồn and Cô Tô are island districts. There are thousands of islands on Hạ Long Bay and Bái Tử Long Bay, many of which contain caves. Besides areas of alluvial deposits, there are also white sand zones which have built up from tidal action. Some places have formed white sand mines producing materials for the glass industry (Van Hai), or have developed into tourism spots (Trà Cổ, Quan Lạn, Minh Châu, Ngọc Vừng).\n\nThe sea bottom terrain of Quảng Ninh isn't smooth, and has an average depth of 20 m. There are the remnants of ancient streams and underwater rocky banks. The streams from the mainland connect to deep drains along the sea-floor; creating a series of waterways, canals and harbours along the coast.\n\nQuảng Ninh's climate is symbolic of the climate of North Vietnam; featuring all four seasons. In summer, it is hot, humid and rainy, while monsoons flourish. The average annual temperature recorded is 22.9 °C. In winter, it is cold (between 1 and 3 °C), dry, and sees little rainfall (between 150 mm and 400 mm). The average humidity is 82 percent. Annual average rainfall, influenced by north-eastern monsoons, varies between 1,700 mm and 2,400 mm (maximum recorded is 2751 mm), with rainfall concentrated in the summer months for 90 to 170 days, particularly in July and August.\n\nIn comparison to other provinces in the north, Quảng Ninh has been more under the influences of north-eastern monsoon. The wind blows strongly and the temperature drops to between 1 and. During the north-east monsoon, high mountainous regions such as Bình Liêu and Hải Hà, Đầm Hà experiences temperatures below 0 °C. Storms have a large influence on the province, mainly in June, July and August. The intensity can be extremely strong, especially in island and coastal regions.\n\nBecause of the terrain differences, the climates of sub-regions differ. The border area of the Móng Cái District is colder and rainy, with an average temperature of around 22 °C and rainfall reaching 2,751 mm. In the Yên Hưng District, the most southern area, the average temperature is 24 °C and gets an average rainfall of 1,700 mm. The high mountainous region of Hoành Bồ, and Ba Chẽ districts, has 20 days of frost a year, and is subject to little rainfall. In the Bình Liêu District there is heavy rain (2,400 mm) and winter lasts for six months. The offshore island region is not the wettest area, with only 1,700 to 1,800 mm of rainfall per year, but winter is often accompanied by thick mists.\n\nIn Quảng Ninh, there are numerous rivers and springs, but most are short and small, and feature currents that differ between seasons. In winter, most rivers run dry; in summer, waterfalls pick up fast currents. The water current reaches 1.45 m/s in dry season, but up to 1,500 m/s in the rainy season. Quảng Ninh's sea borders upon the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. It is large and protected by the ranks of islands, so the wind is quieter and the water smoother. The gulf's current runs from north to south. It is Vietnam's coldest sea, with the temperature sometimes dipping below 13 °C. The average tide level recorded is 2.5 m.\n\nWater resources in the province of Quảng Ninh are abundant and distinct. The largest rivers are: the Ka Long (the natural national border between China and Vietnam), Hà Côi, Đầm Hà, Tiên Yên, Phố Cũ, Ba Chẽ, Diễn Vọng, Trới, Míp, Uông, Đạm and Cầm rivers. The provincial border is the Kinh Thầy River which joins the Đá Bạch River and runs into Bạch Đằng. The total static capacity is estimated at 175.106 m of water. Out of the 72 lakes and dams, there are 28 large lakes with a total of capacity of 195.53 million m of water. The largest is Yên Lập Lake, which blocks the Míp Estuary. Its water volume is 1.18 million m. Other lakes include: Khuất Động, Trúc Bài Sơn, Khe Táu, Đoan Tĩnh, Khe Uơn, Khe Chếnh, Yên Trung, Bến Châu, Trại Lốc, Rộc Cả and An Biên.\n\nUnderground running water is also abundant, and can even be found on some of the larger islands. According to prospective data, 13 urban and industrial areas make use of 64,388 m water/day. In the province there are natural bottle water points in Quảng Hanh (Cẩm Phả), Khe Lạc (Tiên Yên) and Đồng Long (Bình Liêu). Mineral water is concentrated in the village of Quảng Hanh. Presently, there are 15 exploration holes, and according to preliminary results, capacity could be 1,004 m/day. Quảng Hanh mineral water is clear and colourless, with mineral content varying from 3.5 to 5.05 g/L.\n\nThe province has rich natural mineral resources of coal, limestone, clay, kaolin, white sand, granite and so forth. Large reserves of anthracite coal account for 90 per cent of coal output of Vietnam. Limestone reserves are estimated at 3.1 billion tonnes which would be the basic input for cement manufacture. Other mineral resources phosphoric, titan, antimony, quartz and oil have been found which could auger more industrial projects in the Province. Clay and glassy sand, important material inputs in the building industry for manufacture of tiles, bricks fired-bricks, bricks, ceramics, are in abundance.\n\nQuảng Ninh is divided into 13 district-level sub-divisions:\n\n\nThey are further subdivided into 7 commune-level towns (or townlets), 98 communes, and 72 wards.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, Hoành Bồ District was annexed by Hạ Long city.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam, the population of Quảng Ninh province as of 2008 was 1,109,600 with a density of 182 persons per km over a total land area of of the province. The male population during this period was 559,500 with females accounting for 555,700. The rural population was 614,600 against an urban population of 495,000. However, according to the 2009 data, the population of the province is reported to be 1,144,381 people, including women who were 558,793; the proportion of urban population in the province has been ranked third nationally (behind Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang), urban population was 575,939 people (proportion 50.3 per cent) and rural population was 568,442 people. The rate of population growth rate is also higher, the average from 1999 to 2009 was 1.3 per cent as against the national average of 1.2 per cent.\n\nEthnic identity in the province is recorded as 22 ethnic groups. The ethnic groups identified are the Vietnamese (Kinh), Dao, Tay, San Diu, San Chi. The binational population groups comprise the Nung and Muong, Thai, Kh'me, Hre, Hmong, Ede, Co Tu, Gia Rai, Ngai, Xu Dang, Co Ho, Ha Nhi, Lao, her Pup. In this land of ancient culture the dominant religious beliefs are of Buddhists, Christians and ancestor worship in addition to other folk beliefs.\n\nQuảng Ninh, because of its varied terrain, climate and soil, features a diversified and abundant environmental system. The province has a thus a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. Identified floral species number 1,027 of 6 phyla, while faunal species are 120.\n\nThere are the regular domestic animals: cattle, pigs, poultry, cats, dogs, and rabbits. Cattle breeding has developed well in the mountainous regions, while the Móng Cái pig is now famous for its especially lean meat. In eastern districts, swans hybridized with ducks, called \"cà sáy\" by locals, are also becoming popular. Numerous foreign cattle are imported as well: buffaloes from India, milk cows from the Netherlands and India and horses, sheep and goats from Mongolia.\n\nFormerly, as with the rest of Vietnam, there were once numerous wild animals. In more remote times, there were elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, leopards and bears roaming the area. Today, there are monkeys, deer, pheasants, eagles, wild boars, various birds and tortoises (which unfortunately are less abundant than they once were).\n\nIn Quảng Ninh aquatic fauna is very abundant, both fresh and sea water. There are large species of fish in the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. In addition, there are special species such as pearl mussels, stockfish, sea turtles and lobsters, while along the coastline, oysters and edible seaweed abound. These numerous fish resources of the sea have always been an important source of income for the residents of Quảng Ninh.\n\nQuảng Ninh's floral strong point has always been forestry. Agricultural land is narrow and unfertilized, so the production of rice, maize and sweet potatoes is poor. Making up for this is high productivity from fruit trees, lumber trees and industrial plants.\n\nThe area for fruit trees in the Đông Triều District totals around 30 km². Formerly in Quảng Ninh, there was diverse and high-quality wood available, in particular ironwood and teak trees. Presently, there are mainly pine trees. In mountainous areas, there are some very diverse trees and plants, providing spices and traditional medicines.\n\nAlthough economy of the region is agriculture based, other sectors of industries and tourism are also getting priority attention.\n\nBeing in the northern economic triangle (Hà Nội - Hải Phòng - Quảng Ninh), the province has abundant resources and has immense potential to develop the economy in every sector. The People's Committee of Quảng Ninh Province in 2007 approved proposals for development plans up to 2020. Industrial development is taking place at a rapid pace. Mineral extraction industries are being developed. Special economic zones are being created and the plans envisage making the province a modern industrial province by 2015. The two economic development zones under development are the Mong Cai Border Gate Economic Zone and the Van Don Economic Zone. Tourism is also a sector of economic development, which has been given priority. Quảng Ninh has targeted to become a regional high-quality tourism center and an economic growth hub in the North with synchronized socio-economic and technical infrastructure and improved living conditions.\n\nSome of the economic indicators in agriculture, industries and other sectors are the following.\nThere are only 1,440 farms as against the national number of 120,699\n\nThe output value of agriculture produce at constant 1994 prices in the province was 952.5 billion đồngs against the national value of 156,681.9 billion đồngs.\n\nThe province produced 227,700 tonnes of cereals as against the national production of 43.68 million tonnes\n\nThe per capita production of cereals in the district was 205.2 kg as against the national figure of 501.8 kg. in 2008.\n\nIn 2007, the industrial output of the province was a meagre 37,987.5 billion VND against the national output of 1.47 million billion VND.\n\nThe province has number of attractions connected with the landforms such as the mountains and the sea or the bay, religious places of worship and festivals. Some of these are:\n\nBai Tho Mountain is a limestone mountain formation, which rises to a height of 106 meters, right in the middle of the Hạ Long City. It appears like a giant castle with three towers of the undulating rock. Another famous mountain is the That Bai Tho Mountain, which was earlier called the Transmission Mount (\"Then\"). It has historical linkage to the visit of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông to the provincial city in 1468. The emperor was moved by the beauty of the mountain covered with clouds, called it a young fairy of Hạ Long and got a poem written on it and engraved on the southern side of the rocky cliff. In 1729, Lord Trịnh Cương did a painting and poem on Emperor Lê Thánh Tông on this mountain. That's why it was called Bai Tho mountain (Poem mountain).\nBai Tho mountain is an important historical and cultural relic as well as a tourist attraction. Standing in the middle of the mountain, we can see from the distance the blue sea, undulating islands, floating sky, and the surrounding trees, forest flowers, birds, etc.\n\nTwo popular temples in the province are the Cua Ong Temple is located on a mountain overlooking low Bai Tu Long Bay, and the Tien Temple located next to the headquarters of People's Committee of Cam La commune.\n\nBạch Đằng beach is a historical site which commemorates the 13th century victory of Tran Quoc Tuan over the Mongols who had invaded the country with 30,000 troops.\n\nThe road network in the province consists of the National Highways No. 10, 18, and 48. Highway No. 10 links to Hanoi, Haiphong and Northern provinces. National Highway 4B connects with Lạng Sơn and Cao Bằng.\n\nHanoi's Noi Bai International Airport is the closest airport and a highway links it to the Mong Cai International Border Gate over a road distance of 288 km. Hạ Long city is 150 km from the airport. Quang Ninh International Airport is being built closer to Hạ Long, 40 km away at Van Don.\n\nThe Hanoi–Hạ Long (Cai Lan port) railway line has been improved. Rail links of 64 km length connect to industries in the province.\n\nThe water transport is provided by its many rivers and the sea ports such as the Cai Lan port (largest deep water port in North Vietnam is under further expansion to handle cargo of 7–10 million tonnes per year. Another port is the Cu Ong port, which can handle ships of 65,000–70,000 DWT capacity. Other minor ports in the coastline of the province are the Bo, Cau Trang, B12, Mui Chua, Dien Cong, Bach Thai Buoi, Tien Yen and Dan Tien.\n\nThe Bính Bridge crosses the Cấm River and ultimately connects the province with the city of Hai Phong.\n\n\n"}

This may be contrasted with an ellipse, for which the\n\"sum\" of the distances is constant, rather than the product. Cassini ovals are the special case of polynomial lemniscates when the polynomial used has degree 2.\n\nCassini ovals are named after the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini who studied them in 1680. \nCassini believed that the Sun traveled around the Earth on one of these ovals, with the Earth at one focus of the oval.\nOther names include Cassinian ovals, Cassinian curves and ovals of Cassini.\n\nAs with an ellipse, the fixed points formula_6 are called the \"foci\" of the Cassini oval.\n\nIf the foci are (\"a\", 0) and (−\"a\", 0), then the equation of the curve is\nWhen expanded this becomes\n\nThe equivalent polar equation is\n\nThe curve depends, up to similarity, on \"e\" = \"b\"/\"a\". When \"e\" < 1, the curve consists of two disconnected loops, each of which contains a focus. When \"e\" = 1, the curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli having the shape of a sideways figure eight with a double point (specifically, a crunode) at the origin. When \"e\" > 1, the curve is a single, connected loop enclosing both foci. It is peanut-shaped for formula_10 and convex for formula_11. The limiting case of \"a\" → 0 (hence \"e\" → formula_12), in which case the foci coincide with each other, is a circle.\n\nThe curve always has \"x\"-intercepts at ±\"c\" where \"c\" = \"a\" + \"b\". When \"e\" < 1 there are two additional real \"x\"-intercepts and when \"e\" > 1 there are two real \"y\"-intercepts, all other \"x\" and \"y\"-intercepts being imaginary.\n\nThe curve has double points at the circular points at infinity, in other words the curve is bicircular. These points are biflecnodes, meaning that the curve has two distinct tangents at these points and each branch of the curve has a point of inflection there. From this information and Plücker's formulas it is possible to deduce the Plücker numbers for the case \"e\" ≠ 1: degree = 4, class = 8, number of nodes = 2, number of cusps = 0, number of double tangents = 8, number of points of inflection = 12, genus = 1.\n\nThe tangents at the circular points are given by \"x\" ± \"iy\" = \"±a\" which have real points of intersection at (\"±a\", 0). So the foci are, in fact, foci in the sense defined by Plücker. The circular points are points of inflection so these are triple foci. When \"e\" ≠ 1 the curve has class eight, which implies that there should be at total of eight real foci. Six of these have been accounted for in the two triple foci and the remaining two are at \nSo the additional foci are on the \"x\"-axis when the curve has two loops and on the \"y\"-axis when the curve has a single loop.\n\n\"Orthogonal trajectories\" of a given pencil of curves are curves which intersect all given curves orthogonally. For example the orthogonal trajectories of a pencil of confocal ellipses are the confocal hyperbolas with the same foci. For Cassini ovals one has:\n\nProof:<br>\nFor simplicity one chooses formula_17. \nThese conic sections have no points with the y-axis in common and intersect the x-axis at formula_22. Their discriminants show that these curves are hyperbolas. A more detailed investigation reveals that the hyperbolas are rectangular. In order to get normals, which are independent from parameter formula_23 the following implicit representation is more convenient: \nA simple calculation shows, that formula_25 for all formula_26. Hence the Cassini ovals and the hyperbolas intersect orthogonally.\n\n\"Remark:\"<br>\nThe image depicting the Cassini ovals and the hyperbolas looks like the equipotential curves of two equal point charges together with the lines of the generated electrical field. But for the potential of two equal point charges one has formula_27. (See implicit curve.)\n\nThe second is a Cassini oval defined by the equation formula_28. Its foci are at the points \"c\" on the complex plane that have orbits where every second value of \"z\" is equal to zero, which are the values 0 and -1.\n\nCassini ovals appear as planar sections of tori, but only when \n\nThe intersection of the torus with equation\nand the plane formula_30 yields\nAfter partially resolving the first bracket one gets the equation\nwhich is the equation of a Cassini oval with parameters formula_33.\n\nCassini's method is easy to generalize to curves and surfaces with an arbitrary set of defining points:\ndescribes in the planar case an implicit curve and in 3-space an implicit surface.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040912", "title": "Self-induced abortion", "text": "Self-induced abortion\n\nA self-induced abortion (or self-induced miscarriage) is an abortion performed by the pregnant woman herself or with the help of other, non-medical assistance. Although the term includes abortions induced with legal over-the-counter medication, it also refers to efforts to terminate a pregnancy through alternative, sometimes more dangerous means. Such practices may present a threat to the health of women. If the abortion does not result in termination of the pregnancy, damage to the fetus can occur.\n\nSelf-induced abortion is often attempted during the earliest stages of pregnancy (the first eight weeks from the last menstrual period). In recent years, significant reductions in maternal death and injury resulting from self-induced abortions have been attributed to the growing use of misoprostol (known commercially at \"Cytotec\"), an inexpensive, widely available drug with multiple uses, including the treatment of post-partum hemorrhage, stomach ulcers, and induction of labor. The World Health Organization has endorsed a standardized regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or misoprostol alone to induce abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. This regimen has been shown to be up to 83% effective in terminating a pregnancy.\n\nWomen have historically used many different methods to self-induce an abortion. Some are safe and effective, while others are dangerous to the health of the woman and/or ineffective at terminating a pregnancy.  \n\nSelf-induced abortion methods vary around the world. The most commonly recorded are ingestion of plants or herbs, ingesting toxic substances, causing trauma to the uterus, causing physical trauma to the body, ingesting a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol pills, ingesting misoprostol pills alone, using alcohol and drugs in an attempt to end the pregnancy, and ingesting other substances and mixtures. There are no known effectiveness studies for plants, herbs, drugs, alcohol, or other substances. These methods are more likely to cause bodily harm to the pregnant woman than to be effective in terminating a pregnancy. Causing physical trauma to a woman's body or uterus may also result in physical harm or even death to the woman instead of causing an abortion.\n\nThe only scientifically studied effective self-induced abortion method is ingesting a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol or misoprostol alone. The combination of these medications is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In some countries, these pills may be available over-the-counter in pharmacies, although some pharmacists do not provide accurate instructions on use. In Latin America, women have reported self-inducing abortions with misoprostol alone since the 1980s. The history of women self-managing abortion with pills includes projects such as the Socorristas in Argentina and Las Libres in Mexico. Other countries have \"safe abortion hotlines,\" which facilitate access to pills, provide instructions on proper use of the pills, and provide emotional, logistical, and/or financial support. Some women use online abortion pill help services such as Women on Web, Women Help Women, and Aid Access to order mifepristone and/or misoprostol, with reported effectiveness and safety in pregnancy termination and satisfaction in the service. Instructions on abortion pill use are widely available on the website of the World Health Organization as well as reputable public health organizations, including Gynuity and International Women's Health Coalition.\n\nFirst trimester medical abortion is highly safe and effective. The side effects of medication abortion include uterine cramping and prolonged bleeding, and common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The majority of women who use abortion pills on their own do not need an ultrasound or a clinician, although one may be recommended to ensure that the pregnancy is not ectopic. In the rare case of a complication, a woman can access a clinician skilled in miscarriage management, which is available in all countries.\n\nStudies confirm a correlation between the increase in the self-administration of medical abortion with misoprostol, and a reduction in maternal morbidity and mortality. Some studies argue that unfettered access to medication abortion is a key tenet of public health, human rights, and reproductive rights. \n\nAn estimated fifty-six million abortions occurred worldwide, of which twenty-five million are less safe or least safe. \"Induced abortion is medically safe when World Health Organization recommended methods are used by trained persons, less safe when only one of those two criteria is met, and least safe when neither is met.\" Self-induced abortions can be safe or unsafe depending on the methods used. \n\nIt is difficult to measure the prevalence or rate of self-induced abortions. In the United States, the estimate is that one in 10 abortions is self-induced. While maternal morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion has continued to increase due to population growth, in Latin America, from 2005 to 2012, there was a 31% decrease in the number of complications from unsafe abortion, from 7.7/1,000 to 5.3/1,000. Researchers believe that this may be due to the wide availability of misoprostol in Latin America.\n\nThe practice of attempted self-induced abortion has long been recorded in the United States. Turn-of-the-20th-century birth control advocate Margaret Sanger wrote in her autobiography of a 1912 incident in which she was summoned to treat a woman who had nearly died from such an attempt.\n\nIn a letter to the \"New York Times\", gynecologist Waldo L. Fielding wrote:\n\nCharles Jewett wrote \"The Practice of Obstetrics\" in 1901. In it, he stated, \"Oil of tansy and oil of rue are much relied on by the laity for the production of abortion, and almost every day one may read of fatal results attending their use. Oil of tansy in large doses is said to excite epileptiform convulsions; quite recently one of my colleagues met such a case in his practice.\"\n\nIn the 1994 documentary \"Motherless: A Legacy of Loss from Illegal Abortion\", Louis Gerstley, M.D., said that, in addition to knitting needles, some women would use the spokes of bicycle wheels or umbrellas. \"Anything that was metal and long and thin would be used,\" he claimed. He stated that a common complication from such a procedure was that the object would puncture through the uterus and injure the intestines, and the women would subsequently die from peritonitis and infection. Later in the film he mentioned that potassium permanganate tablets were sometimes used. The tablets were inserted into the vagina where they caused a chemical burn so intense that a hole may be left in the tissue. He claimed the tablets left the surrounding tissue in such a state that doctors trying to stitch up the wound couldn't do so because \"the tissue was like trying to suture butter.\" Dr. Mildred Hanson also described the use of potassium permanganate tablets in the 2003 documentary \"Voices of Choice: Physicians Who Provided Abortions Before Roe v. Wade\". She said, \"the women would bleed like crazy because it would just eat big holes in the vagina.\"\n\nDr. David Reuben mentions that many African women use a carved wooden \"abortion stick\" to induce, which has often been handed down.\n\nA study concluded in 1968 determined that over 500,000 illegal abortions were performed every year in the United States, a portion of which were performed by women acting alone. The study suggested that the number of women dying as a result of self-induced abortions exceeded those resulting from abortions performed by another person. A 1979 study noted that many women who required hospitalization following self-induced abortion attempts were admitted under the pretext of having had a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion.\n\nWHO estimates that approximately 22 million abortions continue to be performed unsafely each year, resulting in the death of an estimated 47,000 women and disabilities for an additional 5 million women. Almost every one of these deaths and disabilities could have been prevented through sexual education, family planning, and the provision of safe abortion services. Abortion pills, which were first used by Brazilian women in the 1980s, can prevent many of these deaths from unsafe abortion.\n\nIn the United States, experts report that self-induced abortion can be medically safe but legally risky. The 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade made abortion more readily available throughout the U.S., yet women who have abortions with pills ordered online or through non-clinical means may face risk of arrest. Under federal law in the United States, a person has a constitutional right to an abortion and there are not statutes that ban a person from managing their own abortion.\n\nIt is not common for women in the United States to be charged for the crime of self-inducing an abortion and they are rarely convicted. However, a small number of people in the U.S. have been arrested for ending their own pregnancies with pills ordered online, including Purvi Patel, Jennie Linn McCormack,and Kenlissia Jones. These women were prosecuted under a variety of laws including: laws directly criminalizing self-induced abortions, laws criminalizing harm to fetuses, criminal abortion laws misapplied to people who self-induce, and various laws deployed when no other legal authorization could be found.The non-profit If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice works to change laws and policies than prevent people from managing their own abortion using a reproductive justice framework. The non-profit Plan C: A Safe abortion with pills envisions a world in which the ability to end a pregnancy is in the hands of the person who needs it. Plan C issues a report card on sites that sell pills used to induce an abortion, rating them on price, shipping time, quality, and physician oversight.\n\nAs of 2019, there are seven states with laws directly criminalizing self-induced abortion, 11 states with laws criminalizing harm to fetuses that lack adequate exemptions for the pregnant woman, and 15 states with criminal abortion laws that could be applied to women who self-induce an abortion. Both the National Lawyers Guild and the American Medical Association passed resolutions condemning the criminalization of self-induced abortion.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2040914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040914", "title": "Aérotrain", "text": "Aérotrain\n\nThe Aérotrain was an experimental Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle\n(TACV), or hovertrain, developed in France from 1965 to 1977 under the engineering leadership of Jean Bertin (1917–1975) – and intended to bring the French rail network to the cutting edge of land-based public transportation.\n\nThough similar to a maglev design, which levitates a train car over a complex electromagnetic track to eliminate all resistance other than aerodynamic drag, the Aérotrain – also a \"train without wheels\" – rode on an air cushion over a simple reinforced concrete track or \"guideway\" and could travel at the speed of a maglev train, without the further technical complexity and expense of its track. In many respects, the entire concept resembled a product of the aircraft rather than rail industry.\n\nIn 1969, an U.S. company, Rohr Industries, Inc., licensed the Aérotrain technology to build the hovertrains in the United States. That same year the Aérotrain established the world record for a TACV, the pilots saying that with a longer track even higher speeds could have been reached without major difficulties. The final prototype, the \"Aérotrain I80\", set a world speed record in 1974 for overland air cushion vehicles, reaching a speed of and a peak speed of . The prototypes, which ultimately used twin turbine engines through a ducted propeller with seven blades, demonstrated they could accelerate and decelerate quickly, which offered a huge advantage of enabling effective service between tightly spaced stops.\n\nUS Secretary of Transportation John Volpe, the mayor of Los Angeles and representatives and transportation specialists from over 18 countries came to France and participated in test rides, studied the system and reported on the Aérotrain. Bertin felt the technology was sufficiently realized for full implementation, and the French government signed a contract to implement full-scale service on the outskirts of Paris, between Cergy and La Défense. The Aérotrain nonetheless ran into increasing internal conflicts with its client SNCF, which had no research and development department of its own and strongly favored improving the existing rail system.\n\nAérotrain faced numerous design challenges. The system would require new elevated guideways for every implementation – further pitting Aérotrain against efforts to improve existing \"wheeled\" rail system. Bertin's Versailles-based companies, Bertin and Co. and Aeroglide Systems, Inc., worked to resolve issues with sudden changes in air pressure, as when the train would pass another train or enter a tunnel. Prototypes used gas turbines with giant propellers, which created tremendous noise both inside and outside the train car itself – and thus required reduced speeds in urban areas. SNCF felt they already had trains that could run at those reduced speeds. Proponents pointed out electric linear induction motors could make the TACV silent. Eventually SNCF simply opposed the project, citing a broad litany of concerns.\n\nIn 1974, after his election as President of France, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing formally annulled the contract for the Aérotrain Cergy-La Défense line and SNCF formally shifted support to the \"Train à Grande Vitesse (TGV)\" as its high-speed ground-transportation solution. Notably, D'Estaing's wife was the granddaughter of Eugène Schneider, founder of what became an international syndicate, Schneider Group. Noted Belgian journalist Karel Vereycken pointed out: \"the Schneider dynasty have been and are still a pillar of the history of the French railroad and steel industry. Hence, the innovation of the Aérotrain (to be built by the aircraft industry) would not, in the short run, have made them more wealthy and one can easily imagine that a train without wheels does not get much enthusiastic approval of the feudal wheel producers.\" Rohr abandoned the technology in 1975.\n\nMost of the track for the Aérotrain was constructed of ferroconcrete to provide an inverted \"T\" shape for the monorail, with the tracks ultimately used only for experimental purposes.\n\n\nFive prototypes were built:\n\nIn 1970, Rohr Industries decided to develop a tracked air-cushion vehicle as part of a project by the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) to sponsor development of new mass-transit technology to meet future transit requirements.\n\nThe Rohr prototype, officially called the Urban Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle (UTACV) and colloquially the Rohr Aerotrain, was propelled by linear motor and was designed to carry 60 passengers at 240 km/h (150 mph). It had a length of 28 m (94 ft) and an empty weight of 20.8 tonnes (20,800 kg, 46,000 pounds).\n\nA test track was built in Pueblo, Colorado, where the prototype reached speeds of , constrained by the length of track. Funding from UMTA ceased and the Rohr Industries Aérotrain was never commercialized. The Rohr prototype Aérotrain remained on the premises of the Pueblo Weisbrod Aircraft Museum from approximately 1978 until July 2009, whereupon it was moved to the Pueblo Railway museum. The museum plans to open an Aérotrain exhibit within the test vehicle.\n\n\n\nJean Bertin, suffering with cancer and overworked after a decade of effort, died in December 1975. The I-80 Aérotrain made its last trip on December 27, 1977. On July 17, 1991, the S-44 Aérotrain prototype was destroyed by fire in its storage facility at Gometz-la-Ville and in 1992 the I-80 prototype was destroyed in Chevilly by arson. Of the four prototypes that had been built, the last two remain stored in France.\n\nJean Bertin's company, now , remains in business, focusing on the aerospace, defense, and transportation sectors. Outside Orléans, the remains of the abandoned and partially-demolished elevated concrete test track still stand to this day, easily visible from the parallel SNCF Paris-Orléans railway.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2040952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040952", "title": "Primer 55", "text": "Primer 55\n\nPrimer 55 is an American nu metal band which formed in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, in 1997. The name originated from the combination of Primer, meaning \"something that's unfinished,\" and 55, which refers to Interstate 55, \"the road that drugs run on to get to Chicago through Memphis\".\n\nPrimer 55 was formed in 1997 in Memphis, Tennessee by guitarist Bobby Burns and vocalist J-Sin. The two met when J-Sin's previous band was the opening act for Burns' previous band. Burns' heavy metal music influences and J-Sin's hip hop influences melded to create the band's rap rock sound. Bassist Mike \"Jr.\" Christopher and drummer Josh McLane were then added to complete the lineup.\n\nAfter releasing an EP on the independent label Propellant Transmissions, Primer 55 signed a contract with Island Records and reissued the EP as their debut album, \"Introduction to Mayhem\" on January 25, 2000. The remixed and reconstructed album features appearances from Incubus turntablist Chris Kilmore and Hed PE frontman Jared Gomes.\n\nThe band toured with Biohazard, Slipknot, Machine Head and Dope before scoring a slot as a second-stage performer on the Ozzfest 2000 festival tour. Then, in September 2000, Primer 55 toured alongside Soulfly, downset., and Slaves on Dope. During this time the band experienced several line-up changes, a pattern that would continue on through the recording of their next album and beyond.\n\nOn August 14, 2001, Primer 55 released their second studio album, \"(the) New Release\". It went to number 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart and No. 102 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album's single, \"This Life\" peaked at No. 37 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart. After the album's initial success, it was suddenly shelved by Island Records. Burns told PureGrainAudio, \"The album was out 2 months then 9/11 happened and we got lost in that shuffle that was going on in NY at that time.\"\n\nDespite having their album shelved, the band embarked on \"The $12 Riot Tour\" on October 31 with Dope, Skinlab and Society 1. The next year, Primer 55 performed as the opening act at the 2002 Gathering of the Juggalos in Peoria, Illinois.\n\nIn 2003, the band went on hiatus after struggles with record labels and internal issues among bandmates. Burns joined Soulfly, a band he'd met while touring with Ozzfest 2000. He toured the world and released four albums as the band's bass player. J-Sin would unfortunately battle alcohol and drug addiction, with Burns later describing him as not \"in any shape to tour or anything like that for a really long time.\"\n\nWhen Soulfly went on hiatus in 2007, Crash Music contacted Burns, inspiring him to reform Primer 55 with J-Sin and join fellow Crash Music band Love Said No. The \"Crash Music Metal Crusade Tour\" took both bands out on the road together in late 2007 and the band released the EP \"Family for Life\", a collection of previously unreleased tracks recorded between 1998 and 2002, on November 6.\n\nAt an early 2008 performance, rapper Donny \"The DRP\" Polinske attended a Primer 55 performance in hopes of interesting Burns and J-Sin to guest on a track for his solo album. After only three weeks of touring, however, J-Sin was forced to exit the band due to poor performances and costly antics caused by continued drug and alcohol addictions that would eventually land him in rehab. While J-Sin was replaced temporarily by Heath Joyce, a longtime friend of Burns, officially The DRP would become Primer 55's next vocalist, performing with the band at the 2008 Gathering of the Juggalos alongside 2 Live Crew, Ice-T, and Twiztid.\n\nIn 2009, Primer 55 released the song \"Flexin'\" with an accompanying music video. A full-length album titled \"New American Gangsters\" was in the works until January 2010 when Burns fired all of the other band members. Later that year, the band's MySpace page announced that J-Sin had returned to the band, yet the band also resumed recording and performing with The DRP.\n\nIn early 2012, Primer 55 began playing acoustic sets through the midwestern and southeastern United States after Burns was inspired by watching old MTV Unplugged performances by bands like Nirvana and Korn. In 2012, \"As Seen On TV\" was reissued under the title \"The Big Fuck You\", with bonus tracks.\n\nPrimer 55 went on indefinite hiatus on October 7, 2015 as Burns would work on his band, Murder The Flesh.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, J-Sin died at the age of 40 after a longtime battle with Hepatitis C.\n\nDuring December 2019, there was talk of new shows to commemorate the 20th anniversary of \"Introduction to Mayhem\" in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The estate occupies approximately of land. The estate was named City One as it is on Lot 1, Shatin Town. It has a census area population of 24,758 people. City One is the largest private residential estate in Sha Tin District. There are a total of 52 blocks of residential buildings with 10,642 units. Each tower is about 30 storeys with units ranging from to an area of , offering different floor plans.\n\nCity One was an important project of the Government's plan on developing the Sha Tin New Town in 1979. of land was reclaimed for the construction of the estate. With massive reclamation, the land which City One was built on was formerly Yuen Chau Kok and the Tide Cove. City One was a joint venture between New World Development, Henderson Land Development, Sun Hung Kai Properties and Cheung Kong Holdings in the 1980s.\n\nThe construction of the City One Residential Apartments was completed in seven stages (completion date):\n\nThe property was developed by four major developers led by Henderson Land Development Company Limited.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Population Census the population of the City One census area was 24,758 people. Approximately 44.2% of the population were male, 93.8% were ethnic Chinese, over 93.6% of residents spoke primarily Cantonese. Although English was the second primary language, only 2.9% spoke it as their first language. The drastic change of demographics and social norms in Hong Kong due to the influx of China immigrants under the post-transfer-of-sovereignty policy of assimilation to draw in more Mandarin speaking migrants had been reflected in the population census of City One. International students from China and China immigrants made up mostly of the 2.2% who speak Mandarin and other varieties of Chinese making it the third largest language group in the estate, just 0.7% behind English, which is an official language in Hong Kong. City One had an educated population with over 42% of the population holding a degree, diploma or vocational qualification. This level of education attainment was reflected in the estate's employment patterns: the most popular occupations for employment are Associate professionals (28%), Managers and administrators (17.9%) and Clerical support workers (16.2%). The median monthly domestic household income was HK$32,000, compared with $20,700 in Hong Kong overall.\n\nAccording to the 2016 population by-census, the population of City One had risen slightly to 25,524.\n\nCity One includes a standard swimming pool, several basketball courts, tennis courts, squash courts, table tennis courts, and playgrounds situated on the podium of the newer phases. A jogging trail is available alongside the nearby Shing Mun River. A roof top park was located on the top level of Fortune City One. The arcade surrounds a public open area where local events are often held. A private library managed by the City One management committee provides lending services exclusive to residents of the estate. There is also a community centre administrated by the Hong Kong PHAB Association next to block 35.\n\nDespite being a residential estate, City One is able to satisfy all shopping needs of residents. There are two shopping centres (Fortune City One and Fortune City One Plus, formerly known as City One Plaza and Ngan Shing Commercial Centre respectively). Local businesses including home appliance stores, variety shops, book stores, jewellers, beauty salons, optical centres, boutiques, bottle shops and confectioneries are main tenants of the two arcades. There are also larger business chains within. The ParknShop Superstore offers daily groceries and necessities. Pharmacies Mannings and Watson's, provide shoppers with varieties of healthcare and personal products. Convenience stores Circle K and Seven-Eleven support 24/7 services. The City One Shatin Post Office of the Hongkong Post provides postal and bill paying services in the heart of the estate. Branches of HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Bank of China and ATMs of other banking institutions are conveniently scattered within the two shopping centres.\n\nThe estate was originally planned with three local shopping malls. However, developers had altered the blueprint to a two shopping centre scheme. Land reserved for the third shopping centre is now built with a wet market and three more blocks of residency above it. The wet market, renovated in 2013, has all kinds of Chinese and Asian grocers, butchers, florists, greengrocers and general stores.\n\n\nLocal restaurants like Kam Wo Court offer casual Hong Kong style meals. The famed local dessert chain Hui Lau Shan () have one of its shops in the estate. Major fast food chains such as McDonald's, Café de Coral, Fairwood, Yoshinoya and KFC have outlets all around with extended opening hours.

Other eateries are Sai Kung Sing Vietnam Restaurant – a prize-winning SE Asian restaurant, No.1 Korean Food House, Waitei Japanese Restaurant and Genki Sushi, which are ideal for Japanese gourmets. Starbucks and La Kaffa are where residents and students chill and grab an afternoon cuppa. Nevertheless, bakeries like Norika, Maxim's and A1 offer residents and commuters with freshly baked breakfast every morning.\n\nThe Prince of Wales Hospital and Yuen Chau Kok Clinic are adjacent to the estate. A number of private doctor offices and general practitioners could be found available in the two shopping centres for less urgent patients.\n\nThere are two pre-schools, two primary schools and two secondary schools nearby:\n\nCity One is divided into two constituencies in the Sha Tin District Council, City One (R04) which has been represented by Wong Ka Wing and Yue Shing (R05) which has been represented by Leung Ka Fai. For the legislative council, City One is part of the New Territories East electorate.\n\n\"Also see District Councils of Hong Kong and Legislative Council of Hong Kong\"\n\nCity One Baptist Church (COBC) is the largest Christian fellowship in City One. It is a branch church of the Baptist Convention of Hong Kong. COBC was established in 1984, serving people in all age groups. Worships are conducted in both Cantonese and English language. Most of the gatherings take place at Baptist Lui Ming Choi Primary School and Citymark Plaza in Siu Lek Yuen. Other fellowships in City One include a congregation of the Chinese Rhenish Church (Hong Kong Synod) and International Fellowship North, an English speaking church in the Citimark Building. Kowloon Pentecostal Church Shatin Chapel in Pentecostal Lam Hon Kwong School holds Sunday services as well.\n\nThe City One bus terminal (Citybus) is the terminus of route 61R, 62R and 88R operated by Citybus. Citybus operates several routes from City One to the central business district in Kowloon and on the Hong Kong Island. Many Kowloon Motor Bus bus routes serve City One as a hub, services to Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and other suburbs in the north New Territories are run with high frequency. Long Win Bus (Air Bus) route A41 express service connects City One to the Hong Kong International Airport. Green Public light buses connects City One to the rest of Shatin with routes to Fotan, Ma On Shan and Tai Wai. Red Public light buses operate to/from Mong Kok after hours.\n\nCity One Station, in the southern part of the estate, is a railway station on the Ma On Shan Line. Trains run between Wu Kai Sha Station and Tai Wai Station, which is an interchange to the major East Rail Line. \n\nAs part of the Sha Tin to Central Link, the Ma On Shan Line is being extended through a new tunnel to Diamond Hill, Kai Tak, and Kowloon City to couple with the West Rail Line in 2018.\n\nAs along with all other areas in Hong Kong, City One is easily accessible by taxis. Red urban taxis are chartered to serve the District of Shatin. \n\nThe estate is served by the Sha Tin Road freeway and the Tate's Cairn Highway is in close proximity. Road links between Shatin and Kowloon are provided by the Lion Rock Tunnel, and Tai Po Road. Traffic to the northwestern New Territories has been improved by the Shing Mun Tunnel which links Shatin with Tsuen Wan.\n\nAccess to the northern New Territories has been greatly improved since the opening of the Tolo Highway in September 1985. This, together with Sha Tin Road and Tai Po Road, forms a highway system which connects the New Town with Tai Po and beyond.

HHC was created in 1969 by the New York State Legislature as a public benefit corporation (Chapter 1016 of the Laws 1969). It is similar to a municipal agency, but has a board of directors. It operates eleven acute care hospitals, five nursing homes, six diagnostic and treatment centers, and more than 70 community-based primary care sites, serving primarily the poor and working class. HHC's own MetroPlus Health Plan is one of the New York area's largest providers of government-sponsored health insurance and is the plan of choice for nearly half a million New Yorkers. \n\nThe organization is headquartered at 125 Worth Street in Manhattan. Each year HHC's facilities provide about 225,000 inpatient admissions, one million emergency department visits and five million clinic visits to New Yorkers. HHC facilities treat nearly one-fifth of all general hospital discharges and more than one third of emergency department and hospital-based clinic visits in New York City.\n\nThe most well known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue Hospital – the oldest public hospital in the United States. Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the President of the United States and other world leaders if they become ill or injured while in New York City. The current president and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals is Dr. Mitchell Katz.\n\nThe organization underwent a rebranding initiative in November 2015, shortening its name from 40 characters to 19 characters, as \"NYC Health + Hospitals\".\n\nIn 1736, HHC's oldest hospital, Bellevue Hospital was founded as an infirmary for smallpox and other contagious diseases on the top floor of a public workhouse and jail. Bellevue Hospital was formally named in 1825. At the turn of the 20th century, Bellevue's medical college merged with University Medical College into what would later become the New York University College of Medicine.\n\nIn 1920, Bellevue founded the Children's Psychiatric Service, the first program in the United States devoted to the study of child autism and training child psychiatrists. Bellevue continues to provide through this day comprehensive pediatric services and renowned psychiatric services, as well as highly regarded emergency and trauma services. Bellevue remains the principal teaching hospital for its affiliated New York University School of Medicine. HHC's other hospitals were founded in the late 19th century and early-to-mid-20th century.\n\nIn 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were created and quickly accounted for 86 percent of the income received by the municipal hospital system. Patients with private insurance opted to use private hospitals and Medicaid raised its eligibility. As a consequence, New York City hospitals saw patient numbers and funding decline precipitously. According to a 1967 study just two years later, the conditions and quality of care at public hospitals in New York City were deplorable.\n\nIn 1969, New York City created HHC to replace its Department of Hospitals operating city hospitals and other health care facilities. HHC was formed as a quasi public agency to enable it to benefit from private revenues and funding. HCC's fiscal condition nevertheless has varied periodically since its formation, and it has gone through periods of instability.\n\nThe 125 Worth Street Headquarters of the HHC and the New York City Department of Health was built between 1932-35. Along the top of the building there are 29 last names of pioneers in various fields of medical science and patient care. They are:\n\n\nNYC Health + Hospitals operates 11 hospitals across the city:\n\nCommunity, diagnostic & treatment, and long-term care centers:\n\nHHC has won a number of awards and grants in recent years for its quality of care and innovative community-based programs. In 2006, a study by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ranked quality of care at HHC among the highest in New York City in the areas of heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia. HHC reported that of the 50 hospitals in New York City that voluntarily submitted quality data to CMS, HHC hospitals held seven of the top nine places – and all ranked in the top 17 – when judged by 10 specific measures of healthcare quality for the treatment of patients with life-threatening heart and pulmonary conditions, and that Brooklyn's Coney Island Hospital achieved a first place ranking among all New York City hospitals, public or private.\n\nOn September 30, 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awarded HHC a $10 million grant to be administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The grant, which will provide up to $30 million over three years, is to provide health services to non-responder populations in New York City affected by the World Trade Center attack. Under the grant, HHC will provide medical examinations, diagnostic testing, referral and treatment for residents, students, and others in the community that were directly affected by the dust and debris from the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings on Sept. 11, 2001. Other recent grants to HHC include to expand access to neonatal care and to improve health literacy among low literacy patients.\n\nHHC has won several other prestigious awards in recent years.\n\nIn recent years, HHC has received recognition for its advanced clinical information system which includes a comprehensive electronic health record (also known as an electronic medical record). HHC public hospitals have won the Nicholas E. Davies award for the use of clinical information technology. HHC President Alan Aviles received the CEO IT Achievement Award from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and Modern Healthcare Magazine for leading use of information technology to advance healthcare excellence. And HHC's North Bronx Healthcare Network was awarded Hospitals and Health Networks' Most Wired Award four consecutive years for its use of information technology in safety, quality, customer service, business processes and workforce training.\n\nConditions at the psychiatric unit of the Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, one of 11 HHC hospitals, remain the subject of a lawsuit and scrutiny by the press. In May 2007, the New York State Mental Hygiene Legal Service, the New York Civil Liberties Union, and Kirkland & Ellis, a private law firm, filed a lawsuit against Kings County Hospital. The plaintiffs charged that its psychiatric unit was \"a chamber of filth, decay, indifference and danger.\" The May 2007 lawsuit alleged that patients at the Kings County Hospital \"are subjected to overcrowded and squalid conditions often accompanied by physical abuse and unnecessary and punitive injections of mind-altering drugs.\"\n\nIn December 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York began a separate investigation.\n\nIn June 2008, the plaintiffs in the May 2007 lawsuit released a video of Esmin Green, a 49-year-old patient, dying on the floor of a waiting room in King County Hospital after waiting to be seen by at the psychiatric emergency department for more than 24 hours. Shortly after the release of the video, which was highly publicized, HHC officials agreed in court to implement emergency reforms. Alan Aviles, HHC president, released a statement that he was shocked and distressed by the situation and promised a thorough investigation. Six HHC employees were fired and reforms were implemented. The particular conditions at Kings County Hospital appear to be largely limited to that unit. As part of a broader transparency initiative, HHC voluntarily reported health and safety data for 2008, showing significant declines in infection and mortality rates across its participating hospitals on its website (www.nyc.gov/hhc). Procedures across HHC hospitals and centers, however, are largely unstandardized and conditions vary widely.\n\nOn February 5, 2009, the plaintiffs in the May 2007 lawsuit issued a joint statement acknowledging that reforms had been implemented but stating that further reforms are needed. Plaintiffs stated:\n\n[T]he hospital remains a dangerous place where patient health and safety is at risk on a daily basis. … Clearly, much more works needs to be done. The federal government's involvement brings a vast array of expertise and resources, and we look forward to working with the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney's Office in our efforts to make Kings County Hospital a safe, effective, and therapeutic environment in which New Yorkers can receive the professional care and treatment they deserve. It is our hope and expectation that the express willingness of the defendants to work with DOJ and Plaintiff's counsel will, in fact, result in the change that KCHC so desperately needs.\nBloomberg has stressed the need for, and improvements in, accountability and transparency at HHC, stating in March 2009, “New York City's public hospitals are also national leaders in reporting on patient safety, including the rate of infections acquired during hospital stays – a very troubling problem nationwide. Our taxpayers deserve to know that. That's what accountability is about – and we need to make accountability the norm throughout the country, in big cities and small towns.\"\n\nIn March 2009, HHC announced spending reductions of $105 million and said that it would eliminate 400 jobs because of Medicaid cuts, rising expenses and a growing number of uninsured patients. Alan Aviles, HHC President, said regarding the cuts, \"We can try and ensure that patients who are adversely affected can be linked to alternative care. That, of course, will become more and more difficult as we have to dig deeper and deeper.\"\n\nLocal DC 37, a union representing some of HHC's 30,000 workers, announced: \nIf there is one thing that should be obvious in this economic climate it is that layoffs are not a solution but only compound the problems we're facing. District Council 37 will address this issue aggressively. We are talking to the State to make sure that the federal stimulus moneys are used for the purpose for which they are intended.\nCutbacks will include four school-based health programs, three community clinics, two mental health day treatment programs, and the consolidation of three other hospital-based programs. At the time of the March 2009 announcement, Aviles said these cuts address a fraction of the problem and pointed to additional reductions in the future.\n\nIn early April, Aviles circulated a letter to HHC's employees and its community advisory board stating that due to decisions by Governor Paterson the cuts would be significantly deeper than those reported in March. The effect of the initial and additional funding cutbacks on the ability of HHC to deliver effective community care is unclear. The process by which the cuts were decided upon by Governor Paterson has not yet been reported. It is unclear whether the cutbacks will impact the efficacy in New York City of President Barack Obama's initiative to expand affordable access to healthcare, or how the cuts will affect New York City's ability to offer HHC's industry leading electronic health record system as a model for integrating modern information technology into the healthcare delivery system at the national level.\n\n\n"}

It was the fourth animated feature film to be presented in Dolby sound. The film tells the story of four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians whose careers parallel the history of American popular music in the 20th century.\n\nThe majority of the film's animation was completed through rotoscoping, a process in which live actors are filmed and the subsequent footage is used for animators to draw over. However, the film also uses a variety of other mixed media including water colors, computer graphics, live-action shots, and archival footage.\n\nIn Imperial Russia during the late 1890s, a rabbi's wife and her young son Zalmie escape to America while the rabbi is killed by the Cossacks. Shortly after their arrival in New York City, Zalmie is recruited by Louie, a performer at a burlesque house, to hand out chorus slips (sheets of paper with song chorus lyrics, used to enable audience members to sing along). As Zalmie grows into adolescence, he spends more time with Louie backstage at burlesque shows. When Zalmie's mother dies in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, he begins working with Louie full-time at a small theatre. Though Zalmie aspires to be a singer, he is beginning to enter puberty and his changing voice becomes a significant obstacle. When World War I strikes, Zalmie travels the globe performing for the troops as the bottom half of a pantomime horse and sustains a wound to his throat during a German air raid, which ends his singing career.\n\nWhen Zalmie returns to New York, he briefly continues performing as a clown, and falls in love with a stripper named Bella, vowing to make her a famous singer and getting involved with mobsters in order to do so. After Zalmie impregnates her, he uses money from mob boss Nicky Palumbo to pay for their wedding. Bella achieves modest success, but she is killed after opening a package containing a bomb intended for Zalmie. Their son, Benny, who is already an introverted child, focuses all of his efforts into becoming a talented jazz pianist. Benny marries Palumbo's daughter at Zalmie's request and enlists to fight in World War II seeking redemption for his family, despite pleas from his father. Benny is killed in Nazi Germany when he stops to play on an abandoned piano and is caught off-guard by a Nazi soldier; Benny begins to play Lili Marleen and the Nazi closes his eyes in bliss, but when the song ends, the Nazi pauses only to thank Benny before riddling him and the piano with gunfire. Benny's wife and son, named Tony, now live in a suburban Long Island town, and they watch as Zalmie testifies against Palumbo on television, calling him a rat.\n\nA teenage Tony steals his stepfather's car and drives across the country for four weeks, ending up in Kansas, where he spends the day washing dishes at a diner and spends the night with a waitress. In California, Tony takes another job dishwashing, but soon grows tired of it and quits. A six-piece rock group invites him to write songs for them after hearing him playing a harmonica under their doorstep. The band becomes successful but slowly starts to decompose because of the heroin addictions of female lead singer Frankie Heart and Tony himself. Tony becomes addicted to drugs after being hospitalized from falling off a stage while on acid at one of Frankie's shows. Frankie and the band's drummer, Johnny Webb marry, but divorce after two weeks, and Frankie begins an affair with Tony. In Kansas, the band is set to perform after Jimi Hendrix, but Frankie overdoses backstage, and Tony meets a blonde, blue-eyed boy, Little Pete, whom Tony realizes is his son, conceived the night he spent with the waitress.\n\nTony moves back to New York City accompanied by Pete, where he becomes heavily involved with drug dealing. Pete makes a small amount of money playing the acoustic guitar, but Tony takes any money that Pete earns to buy drugs for himself. One day, Tony and Pete argue over the latter's guitar, where Pete reveals that he knows Tony is his father. After he tells the story of his own father, Tony gives Benny's harmonica to Pete, then takes Pete's guitar to pawn it, telling Pete to wait on the city bench they're at. The next morning, a man approaches Pete and gives him a small package of drugs to sell and the pawn slip for his guitar and tells Pete that Tony said goodbye to him. After years of selling drugs to rock bands, Pete refuses to sell the band members any more cocaine unless they are willing to listen to his music. Playing \"Night Moves\", his talent stuns both the band and the management and they agree to record and hire him on the spot. The film ends with Pete performing in concert with the band, images of his ancestors appearing during his performance.\n\nFollowing the production struggles of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Ralph Bakshi decided that it was time to work on something more personal. He pitched \"American Pop\" to Columbia Pictures president Dan Melnick. Bakshi wanted to produce a film with an extensive soundtrack of songs which would be given an entirely new context in juxtaposition to the visuals in a film. While the film does not reflect Bakshi's own experiences, its themes were strongly influenced by individuals he had encountered in Brownsville. The film's crew included character layout and design artist Louise Zingarelli, Vita, Barry E. Jackson, and Marcia Adams, each of whom brought their own personal touch to the film. Bakshi once again used rotoscoping, in an attempt to capture the range of emotions and movement required for the film's story.

They are artisanally fished. \n\nThe California sea cucumber can grow to a length of and a width of . It has a soft, cylindrical body, with red-brown to yellowish leathery skin. It has an endoskeleton just below the skin. The mouth and anus are on opposite ends of the body. The mouth is surrounded by twenty retractable tentacles that are used to bring food in. Five rows of tube feet extend from the mouth to the anus. They use their tube feet located on the underside of their body to attach themselves to rocks.\n\nThe California sea cucumber is a scavenger that feeds on organic matter. They feed by sifting through sediments with their tentacles, or by positioning themselves in a current where they can use their tentacles to catch food flowing by.\n\n\"A. californianus\" is a solitary nocturnal animal. When threatened, it can expel its organs through its anus. It can also expel sticky filaments to ensnare or confuse predators. \n\nThese sea cucumbers have separate sexes, and eggs are fertilized externally.

{"id": "2041006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041006", "title": "Dark Seed (video game)", "text": "Dark Seed (video game)\n\nDark Seed is a psychological horror point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on the artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 × 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger's demand. A sequel, \"Dark Seed II\", was released in 1995.\n\nMike Dawson is a successful advertising executive and writer who has recently bought an old mansion on Ventura Drive (named after Ventura Boulevard) in the small town of Woodland Hills. On his first night at the house, Mike has a nightmare about being imprisoned by a machine that shoots an alien embryo into his brain. He wakes up with a large headache and, after taking a painkiller and a shower, explores the mansion. He finds clues about the previous owner's death, which reveal the existence of a parallel universe called the Dark World ruled by sinister aliens called the Ancients.\n\nOn the second day, he travels to that universe through the living room mirror and meets the Keeper of the Scrolls, a friendly darkworlder. She tells him that the nightmare he had on his first night was real and warns him that if the embryo—the eponymous Dark Seed—is born, it will kill him and all of humanity. The only way to stop this, she says, is to destroy the Ancient's Power Source.\n\nOn the third and final day, Mike executes an elaborate plan that culminates with the Ancient ship's departure on the Dark World, depriving them of their power source, and the destruction of the living room mirror, sealing the Ancients out of the Normal World. The game ends with the town librarian visiting Mike and telling him she found some pills in her purse prescribed to Mike. The medication will presumably kill the embryo inside his head. A morphing animation reveals that, unbeknownst to the librarian, she is the Keeper of the Scrolls' counterpart. Mike then states that he's just beginning to understand.\n\nUnlike most point-and-click adventure games, which give the player time to explore, many actions in \"Dark Seed\" must occur within precise time limits, or the game will end up in an unwinnable state. As a result of this, one must start over repeatedly to win without resorting to a walkthrough. Amiga Format, in its review, stated with regards to \"Darkseed's\" gameplay: \"Too many things in the game need to be done within a specific time, or in a certain order, and you don't necessarily know when you've passed that 'critical point' after which you're fighting a lost cause. As a result, you often have to play the game several times over, going through scenes you've seen countless times before.\" Certain events/puzzles rely on the player dying and then learning from there what to do: for instance, on day two, police wait outside Dawson's house in the afternoon to arrest him if he steps outside the front door, with no clue as to their presence until it's too late, resulting in a game over. Similarly, the player must take a painkiller each morning in the bathroom or the protagonist continually complains about a headache after every line of dialogue; there is no hint or indication to do this.\n\nThe player has three real time hours within which they must complete the game, which is the equivalent of three in-game days. Time can also be passed by using the in-game wait function, and the time can be checked by looking at Dawson's watch, or by inspecting the grandfather clock in the house. At the end of each day, Dawson goes to sleep and upon going to bed, each night he has a nightmare of the Dark World. Dawson automatically goes to sleep at ten P.M. each night, regardless of where the player is. If it becomes night while Dawson is in the Dark World, he will fall asleep and die, resulting in a game over. Dawson is able to access the Dark World on day two upon receiving a piece of a mirror in the mail and re-assembling it with the rest of the mirror, creating a portal to the Dark World. Every room, person and object in the normal world has a Dark World equivalent and this is often necessary for puzzle solving.\n\nWhen interacting with objects, the options available to the player include look/inquire, touch/manipulate, and move, denoted by a \"?\", a hand, and four arrows pointing inwards respectively. Looking at an object and manipulating an object are context-sensitive: the \"?\" becomes a \"!\" when the cursor is over items or areas of interest and the hand icon points upwards when the cursor is over items that can be picked up or manipulated. \n\nWhen Cyberdreams approached H. R. Giger about providing artwork for a video game, the artist disliked the proposed use of VGA Mode 13h's 320 by 200 graphics and demanded higher resolution, calling lower resolution \"square and jagged.\" The developers agreed to use 640 by 350 mode instead, although doing so reduced the palette from 256 to 16 colors. Cyberdreams received access to almost all of Giger's artwork. Some of the work selected for use in Dark Seed includes: \"N.Y. City III\", \"Hommage a Bocklin\", and \"Li II\". \"Li II\" is featured on the cover, box and manual art.\n\nDevelopers used an Epson flatbed scanner to import selected body parts and landscape fragments in monochrome, then with Deluxe Paint II Enhanced for MS-DOS assembled them into single images. An Amiga and an SVHS camera digitized actors' poses that Cyberdreams further edited on PCs. After the company decided that the images were inadequate late in the development process, developers hand colored the art for six more months. The main character, Mike Dawson, is named after the game's designer and producer. He also lent his appearance to the character's sprite. \n\nThe original game was released for MS-DOS first, then Amiga, Amiga CD32, Macintosh, Sega Saturn and PlayStation. The Amiga CD32 version includes narration for Mike Dawson's dialogue, voiced by Mike Dawson, which is left unvoiced in other versions. The PlayStation and Saturn versions were released only in Japan; however, these console versions are not dubbed in Japanese, only subtitled, making the game's story still accessible to English speakers. These ports have been criticized for doubling the speed that time flows in the game though, as well as speeding up the soundtrack. The Saturn version is also compatible with the Sega Saturn Net Link Mouse.\n\nThere was also a version developed for the Sega CD and even promoted for American release, but publisher Vic Tokai never released it. An unlicensed version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Chinese, however an English translated ROM is currently being worked on by a small nonprofit team.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" called \"Dark Seed\" in 1992 \"the most integrated and effective feel for a horror adventure yet\" but criticized the unforgiving real-time gameplay that often caused unwinnable situations, hard-to-find on-screen puzzle elements, and an overly abrupt ending, stating that \"the interactive elements are so poorly implemented that they nearly destroy the effect\" of the graphics and sound. The magazine nonetheless concluded that the game \"hint[s] at tremendous potential\" and hoped that Cyberdreams' future games would be \"not only beautiful, but fun to play\". \"QuestBusters\" recommended the game to fans of the \"Alien\" films and Accolade's \"\" games. The reviewer wrote, \"The graphics are impressive, the atmosphere gripping, but for me the staying power was the story and wondering what was going to happen next\", and concluded, \"I didn't think it was the best thing out this year, but I certainly would have missed out if I'd passed it by. Give it a shot.\" The game was reviewed in 1992 in \"Dragon\" #188 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n\"Amiga Format\" gave the Amiga version of \"Dark Seed\" an overall score of 72%, praising the use of Giger's artwork and \"stunningly spooky\" graphics, calling it \"the nearest thing you could have to a software nightmare\", but criticizes its strict timeframe, and refers to \"Dark Seed's\" gameplay as \"its weakest element\". \"The One\" gave the Amiga version of \"Dark Seed\" an overall score of 80%, praising its \"well-designed\" controls, and states that \"The premise isn't a particularly original one, but good sci-fi is all about ideas and \"Darkseed\" has plenty of them, most of which are used to good effect game-wise - I particularly like the way the real and alien worlds mirror each other\". \"The One\" also praises the music and graphics, expressing that the game \"creates a strong atmosphere, with some superb music ... Giger's artwork adds greatly to the claustophobic tension.\" They criticize the amount of time it takes to get to different locations, calling it \"tedious\", as well as the \"rigorous\" time limit, stating that \"in \"Darkseed\" it sometimes feels like you're playing to a timetable and if you're not in the right place at the right time, a vital clue or character may be lost forever.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" gave the Sega CD version (which was ultimately never released) three out of five stars, describing it as \"a perfect example of graphic-adventure-as-nightmare ... Half of the game's appeal lies in the bizarre and frightening hallucinations suffered by the hero (or maybe they aren't hallucinations...). We recommend checking it out.\" \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Sega Saturn version of the game a 24 out of 40.\n\nIn 1993, the game received a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Fantasy Role-Playing/Adventure.\n\n\"Dark Seed\" was a nominee for \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\"s 1992 \"Best Adventure\" award, which ultimately went to \"The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel\". The magazine's Theo Clarke wrote, \"The strength of this game lies in its atmosphere, but my pleasure was diminished by the use of a master diskette at the security device.\"\n\nIn 2006 GameTrailers named \"Dark Seed\" the seventh scariest game of all time, ranking it above \"Clock Tower\", \"System Shock 2\", and \"\".\n\nAn urban legend spread that the intense pressure of designing the game gave lead designer Mike Dawson a mental breakdown. However, he actually left the games industry after completing \"Dark Seed\" and moved into television writing (including some episodes of \"Family Matters\") until the late 1990s, wrote four books on programming (including \"Beginning C++ Game Programming\" and \"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner\") and is teaching game design and programming classes at Stanford University and UCLA.\n\n"}

The class of objects, \"unowned things\", are objects which are not yet property; either because it has been agreed by sovereign nations that no one can own them, or because no person, or other entity, has made a claim of ownership.\n\nThe most common unowned things are asteroids. The UN's Outer Space Treaty does not address the issue of private ownership of natural objects in space. All asteroids remain unowned things until some person or entity makes a claim of property right to one of them.\n\nIn an experimental legal case of first impression, a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment was filed in a United States Federal Court to determine the lawful owner of Asteroid 433 Eros. 433 Eros was claimed as property by Gregory W. Nemitz of Orbital Development. According to the homestead principle, Nemitz argued that he had the right to claim ownership of any celestial body that he made use of; he claimed he had designated Eros a spacecraft parking facility and wished to charge NASA a parking and storage fee of twenty cents per year for its NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft that is permanently stored there.

They were influential in power network theories, especially those challenging a single command hierarchy. She was a major influence in the theory of participatory democracy, consensus decision-making and collective intelligence, though her own work focused mostly on problems of elite formation in the American women's movement of the 1960s.\n\n\"The characteristic prerequisite for participating in all the informal elites of the movement, and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication to feminism, talents or potential contribution to the movement. The former are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be politically effective.\"\n\nShe defines, by default, politics as usual: to form power networks one must avoid working with one's friends and work specifically with those who are talented, competent, dedicated, and willing to make contributions - not simply those that one likes or would choose, if one were not actually seeking to re/gain power.\n\nThe dialectic between formal and informal power is critical: \"If the movement continues deliberately not to select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously ensures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.\"\n\nFreeman advocated a power structure and claimed that \"once the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of structurelessness, it will be free to develop those forms of organisation best suited to its healthy functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organisation. But neither should we blindly reject them all. Some traditional techniques will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into what we should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques to use for different situations. The 'lot system' is one such idea which has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, but it is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself - only its excessive use.\"\n\nPrinciples of democratic structuring that Freeman claimed were \"politically effective also\" included:\n\n\nFreeman claimed that \"when these principles are applied, they ensure that whatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be controlled by and be responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of authority will be organized in structures that are diffuse, flexible, open and temporary. They will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it.\"\n"}

The ruling Liudolfing house, also known as the Ottonian dynasty, is named after him; he is its oldest verified member.\n\nHe was the son of one margrave () Brun or Brunhart and his wife, Gisla von Verla. Liudolf had extended possessions in the western Harz foothills and on the Leine river, he also served as a military leader \"(dux)\" in the wars of the East Frankish king Louis the German against Norman invasions, the Polabian Slavs, and Great Moravia. Later authors called Liudolf a Duke of the Eastern Saxons (\"dux Orientalis Saxonum\", probably since 850) and Count of Eastphalia.\n\nAbout 830 Liudolf married Oda, daughter of a Frankish \"princeps\" named Billung and his wife Aeda. By marrying a Frankish nobleman's daughter, Liudolf followed suggestions set forth by Charlemagne about ensuring the integrity of the Carolingian Empire in the aftermath of the Saxon Wars through marriage. Oda died on 17 May 913, supposedly at the age of 107. They had at least seven children:\n\nIn 845/846, Liudolf and his wife went on a pilgrimage to Rome, and upon approval by Pope Sergius II they founded a house of holy canonesses dedicated to Pope Saints Anastasius and Innocent around 852.

{"id": "2041030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041030", "title": "Pacific saury", "text": "Pacific saury\n\nThe Pacific saury (\"Cololabis saira\") is a member of the family Scomberesocidae. This saury, which is a food source in some East Asian cuisines, is also known by the name mackerel pike.\n\nIt is known as \"sanma\" (さんま / サンマ / 秋刀魚) and \"saira\" (さいら / サイラ /佐伊羅) in Japanese, \"kkongchi\" (꽁치) in Korean, Pinyin: \"qiū dāo yú\" in Chinese (秋刀鱼 in Simplified Chinese or 秋刀魚 in Traditional Chinese), and \"saira\" (сайра) in Russian. The term \"saira\" used in its scientific name is the fish's local name in the Kii Peninsula region of Japan. The Kanji used in the Japanese name of the fish (秋刀魚) literally translate as \"autumn knife fish\", in reference to its body shape, somewhat resembling a katana, and its peak season.This name was born in Japan and it was derived from Japanese to Chinese.\nThe name \"saira\" also changed from Japanese (Wakayama dialect) to scientific name and Russian.\nPacific saury are often imported to the United Kingdom where they are used as bait for pike and sea fishing. In the UK they are usually called \"blueys\", possibly due to people confusing the Pacific saury with blue mackerel.\n\nIt is a fish with a small mouth, an elongated body, a series of small finlets between the dorsal and anal fins, and a small forked tail. The color of the fish is dark green to blue on the dorsal surface, silvery below, and there are small, bright blue blotches distributed randomly on the sides. The average overall body length of a mature Pacific saury is 25 to 28 cm, and their maximum reported age is four years.\n\nThese pelagic schooling fish are found in the North Pacific, from Korea and Japan eastward to the Gulf of Alaska and southward to subtropical Mexico; 67°N – 18°N, 137°E – 108°W, preferring temperatures around 15 – 18 °C. Pacific saury are usually found near the surface (though they may have a depth range of 0 – 230 m), and they are known to glide above the surface of the water when moving away from predators (a behavior that links them to the flying fish, a cousin of the saury family).\n\nThe Pacific saury is a highly migratory species. Adults are generally found offshore, near the surface of the ocean, in schools. Juveniles associate with drifting seaweed. Pacific saury are oviparous. Eggs are attached to one another and to floating objects such as seaweed via filaments on the shell surface.\n\nThe saury feeds on zooplankton, such as copepods, krill, amphipods, and the eggs and larvae of common fish, such as anchovies, due to their lack of stomach, and their short straight intestines . This is much different from its counterpart the Northern Pike. This is most likely due to the great size difference.\n\nA few of the natural predators of Pacific saury include marine mammals, squid and tuna.\n\nPacific saury (often marketed as \"mackerel pike\") are sought after by Chinese, Taiwanese, Russian, North Korean, South Korean, and Japanese fishermen. This fish has great economic importance where it is found.\n\nFishing of saury is facilitated by their attraction to light. So, a common way of catching them is to affix powerful lighting fixtures with a number of 500 W blue or white lamps to one side of a boat, and some weaker red lamps to the other. When fish congregate under the stronger white lamps, the lighting is switched to the other side, where the fish – often the whole school – are collected in nets .\n\nSaury, or \"sanma\", is one of the most prominent seasonal foods representing autumn in Japanese cuisine. It is most commonly served salted and grilled (broiled) whole, garnished with \"daikon oroshi\" (grated daikon) and served alongside a bowl of rice and a bowl of miso soup. Other condiments may include soy sauce, sudachi, lime, lemon, or other citrus juices. The intestines are bitter, but many people choose not to gut the fish, as many say its bitterness, balanced by the condiments, is part of the enjoyment. Salt-grilled saury is also served in Korea, where it is known as \"kkongchi gui\" (꽁치구이).\n\n\"Sanma\" sashimi is becoming increasingly available but is not common. Although rarely used for sushi, \"sanma-zushi\" is a regional delicacy along parts of the Kii Peninsula, especially along the coast of southern Mie Prefecture. It is prepared by pickling the saury in salt and vinegar (depending on the region, bitter orange or citron vinegar may be used), and then placing it on top of vinegared rice to create the finished sushi.\n\nThe fish can also be pan-fried or canned kabayaki.\n\nGwamegi is a Korean dish of half-dried Pacific saury made during winter. It is mostly eaten in the region of North Gyeongsang Province in places such as Pohang, Uljin, and Yeongdeok, where a large amount of the fish are harvested.\n\nSimmered saury (꽁치조림, \"kkongchi-jorim\") is a common variety of jorim, Korean traditional simmered foods.\n\nPacific saury is also popular in Russia which has direct access to the Pacific Ocean. In Russia it is sold in tinned variant with salt and spice, sometimes with addition of vegetable oil or tomato sauce. It is also eaten smoked.\n\nIn some Western countries it is used for fish meal and pet food.\n\n\n"}

He became head of the Academy around 127/6BC. He was an Academic skeptic like his master. Nothing survives of his writings, which were dedicated to making known the views of Carneades, but Cicero made use of them for some of his works.\n\nClitomachus was born in Carthage in 187/6BC as Hasdrubal (, \"Hasdroúbas\"; , \"ʿAzrubaʿal\", \"Help of Baal\"). He came to Athens in 163/2 BC, when he was about 24 years old. There he became connected with the founder of the New Academy, the philosopher Carneades, under whose guidance he rose to be one of the most distinguished disciples of this school; but he also studied at the same time the philosophy of the Stoics and Peripatetics. In 127/6 BC, two years after the death of Carneades, he became the effective head (scholarch) of the Academy. He continued to teach at Athens till as late as 111 BC, as Crassus heard him in that year. He died in 110/09 BC, and was succeeded as scholarch by Philo of Larissa.\n\nOf his works, which amounted to 400 books, only a few titles are preserved. His main object in writing them was to make known the philosophy of his master Carneades, from whose views he never dissented. Clitomachus continued to reside at Athens till the end of his life; but he continued to cherish a strong affection for his native country, and when Carthage was captured and destroyed in 146 BC, he wrote a work to console his unfortunate countrymen. This work, which Cicero says he had read, was taken from a discourse of Carneades, and was intended to exhibit the consolation which philosophy supplies even under the greatest calamities. His work was highly regarded by Cicero, who based parts of his \"De Natura Deorum\", \"De Divinatione\" and \"De Fato\" on a work of Clitomachus he names as \"On the Withholding of Assent\" ().\n\nClitomachus probably treated the history of philosophy in his work on the philosophical sects: \"On the Schools of Thought\" ().\n\nTwo of Clitomachus' works are known to have been dedicated to prominent Romans, the poet Gaius Lucilius and the one-time consul Lucius Marcius Censorinus, suggesting that his work was known and appreciated in Rome.\n\n"}

He is also the author of \"Out of Bounds\", a critical look at the unhealthy influence of sports on ethics, and he served on the Knight Foundation's Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics investigating abuses within college sports.\n\nPrior to entering politics, McMillen was a star basketball player on all levels. In 1970, he was the number one high school basketball player in the U.S. coming out of Mansfield, Pennsylvania, and was the biggest recruiting catch early in Coach Lefty Driesell's career at the University of Maryland, beating out rival Coach Dean Smith of the University of North Carolina for McMillen's services. McMillen was also a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team that lost a controversial gold medal game to the Soviet Union.\n\nMcMillen received his B.S. from University of Maryland in chemistry, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. After graduating from Maryland in 1974, McMillen was drafted with the ninth pick in the first round of the 1974 NBA draft by the Buffalo Braves and the first round of the 1974 ABA Draft by the Virginia Squires. McMillen signed with the Braves but postponed his entry into the NBA in order to attend the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. During his time at Oxford, McMillen commuted to Bologna, to play for Italian club Virtus Bologna. During his eleven-year National Basketball Association career, he played for the Braves, New York Knicks, Atlanta Hawks, and Washington Bullets, before he retired in 1986 to pursue his political career.\n\nHe was elected to the U.S. Congress as a Democrat to represent Maryland's 4th district, and served 1987–1993 as that district's representative.\n\nIn 1992, the 4th was redrawn as a black-majority district due to a mandate from the Justice Department. His home in Crofton was drawn into the Eastern Shore-based 1st District, represented by one-term Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest. Although McMillen did very well in the more urbanized areas of the district near Baltimore and Washington, D.C., it was not enough to overcome Gilchrest's margin on the Eastern Shore, and McMillen lost his reelection bid. In November of that year, McMillen appears on video with Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nMcMillen is thought to be the tallest-ever member of Congress. At 6 feet 11 inches, he is two feet taller than Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is believed to be the shortest representative ever.\n\nMcMillen was appointed to the University System of Maryland's Board of Regents in 2007, where he served until June 30, 2015. He was replaced by Robert R. Neall whom McMillen had defeated for Congress in 1986.\n\nIn September 2015, McMillen was selected to lead the Division 1-A Athletic Directors’ Association as it moved from Dallas to Washington, D.C. He remains President and Chief Executive Officer of the renamed Lead1 Association, now advocating for athletic directors at Football Bowl Subdivision universities.\n\nMcMillen is married to Dr. Judith Niemyer. The couple has lived in Fauquier County, VA since 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "2041040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041040", "title": "Fipronil", "text": "Fipronil\n\nFipronil is a broad-spectrum insecticide that belongs to the phenylpyrazole chemical family. Fipronil disrupts the insect central nervous system by blocking GABA-gated chloride channels and glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channels. This causes hyperexcitation of contaminated insects' nerves and muscles. Fipronil's specificity towards insects is believed to be due to its greater affinity to the GABAA receptors of insects, than to those of mammals, and to its action on GluCl channels which do not exist in mammals. there did not appear to be significant resistance, at least among fleas, to this insecticide.\n\nBecause of its effectiveness on various pests, fipronil is used as the active ingredient in flea control products for pets and home roach traps as well as field pest control for corn, golf courses, and commercial turf. Its widespread use makes its specific effects the subject of considerable attention. This includes ongoing observations on possible off-target harm to humans or ecosystems as well as the monitoring of resistance development.\n\nFipronil is or has been used in:\n\n\nFipronil is classed as a WHO Class II moderately hazardous pesticide, and has a rat acute oral of 97 mg/kg.\n\nIt has moderate acute toxicity by the oral and inhalation routes in rats. Dermal absorption in rats is less than 1% after 24 h and toxicity is considered to be low. It has been found to be very toxic to rabbits.\n\nThe photodegradate MB46513 or desulfinylfipronil, appears to have a higher acute toxicity to mammals than fipronil itself by a factor of about 10.\n\nSymptoms of acute toxicity via ingestion includes sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, agitation, weakness, and tonic-clonic seizures. Clinical signs of exposure to fipronil are generally reversible and resolve spontaneously. As of 2011, no data were available regarding the chronic effects of fipronil on humans. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified fipronil as a group C (possible human) carcinogen based on an increase in thyroid follicular cell tumors in both sexes of the rat. However, as of 2011, no human data are available regarding the carcinogenic effects of fipronil.\n\nTwo Frontline TopSpot products were determined by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to pose no significant exposure risks to workers applying the product. However, concerns were raised about human exposure to Frontline spray treatment in 1996, leading to a denial of registration for the spray product. Commercial pet groomers and veterinary physicians were considered to be at risk from chronic exposure via inhalation and dermal absorption during the application of the spray, assuming they may have to treat up to 20 large dogs per day. Fipronil is not volatile, so the likelihood of humans being exposed to this compound in the air is low.\n\nIn contrast to neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, which are absorbed through the skin to some extent, fipronil is not absorbed substantially through the skin.\n\nFipronil may be quantitated in plasma by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation.\n\nFipronil is highly toxic for crustaceans, insects and zooplankton, as well as bees, termites, rabbits, the fringe-toed lizard, and certain groups of gallinaceous birds. It appears to reduce the longevity and fecundity of female braconid parasitoids. It is also highly toxic to many fish, though its toxicity varies with species. Conversely, the substance is relatively innocuous to passerines, wildfowl, and earthworms.\n\nIts half-life in soil is four months to one year, but much less on soil surface because it is more sensitive to light (photolysis) than water (hydrolysis).\n\nFew studies of effects on wildlife have been conducted, but studies of the nontarget impact from emergency applications of fipronil as barrier sprays for locust control in Madagascar showed adverse impacts of fipronil on termites, which appear to be very severe and long-lived. Also, adverse effects were indicated in the short term on several other invertebrate groups, one species of lizard (\"Trachylepis elegans\"), and several species of birds (including the Madagascar bee-eater).\n\nNontarget effects on some insects (predatory and detritivorous beetles, some parasitic wasps and bees) were also found in field trials of fipronil for desert locust control in Mauritania, and very low doses (0.6-2.0 g a.i./ha) used against grasshoppers in Niger caused impacts on nontarget insects comparable to those found with other insecticides used in grasshopper control. The implications of this for other wildlife and ecology of the habitat remain unknown, but appear unlikely to be severe. Unfortunately, this lack of severity was not observed in bee species in South America. Fipronil is also used in Brazil and studies on the stingless bee \"Scaptotrigona postica\" have shown adverse reactions to the pesticide, including seizures, paralysis, and death with a lethal dose of .54 ng a.i./bee and a lethal concentration of .24 ng a.i./μl diet. These values are highly toxic in \"Scaptotrigona postica\" and bees in general. Toxic baiting with fipronil has been shown to be effective in locally eliminating German wasps. All colonies within foraging range were completely eliminated within one week.\n\nIn May 2003, the French Directorate-General of Food at the Ministry of Agriculture determined that a case of mass bee mortality observed in southern France was related to acute fipronil toxicity. Toxicity was linked to defective seed treatment, which generated dust. In February 2003, the ministry decided to temporarily suspend the sale of BASF crop protection products containing fipronil in France. The seed treatment involved has since been banned.\n\nNotable results from wildlife studies include:\n\nFipronil is one of the main chemical causes blamed for the spread of colony collapse disorder among bees. It has been found by the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France that even at very low nonlethal doses for bees, the pesticide still impairs their ability to locate their hive, resulting in large numbers of forager bees lost with every pollen-finding expedition. A synergistic toxic effect of fipronil with the fungal pathogen \"Nosema ceranae\" was recently reported. The functional basis for this toxic effect is now understood: the synergy between fipronil and the pathogenic fungus induces changes in male physiology leading to infertility. \nA 2013 report by the European Food Safety Authority identified fipronil as \"a high acute risk to honeybees when used as a seed treatment for maize and on July 16, 2013 the EU voted to ban the use of fipronil on corn and sunflowers within the EU. The ban took effect at the end of 2013.\"\n\nFipronil acts by binding to allosteric sites of GABA receptors and GluCl receptors (of insects) as an antagonist (a form of noncompetitive inhibition). This prevents the opening of chloride ion channels normally encouraged by GABA, reducing the chloride ions' ability to lower a neuron's membrane potential. This results in an overabundance of neurons reaching action potential and likewise CNS toxicity via overstimulation.\n\nIn animals and humans, fipronil overdose is characterized by vomiting, agitation, and seizures, and can usually be managed through use of benzodiazepines\nFipronil was discovered and developed by Rhône-Poulenc between 1985 and 1987, and placed on the market in 1993 under the . Between 1987 and 1996, fipronil was evaluated on more than 250 insect pests on 60 crops worldwide, and crop protection accounted for about 39% of total fipronil production in 1997. Since 2003, BASF holds the patent rights for producing and selling fipronil-based products in many countries.\n\nThe 2017 Fipronil eggs contamination is an incident in Europe and South Korea involving the spread of insecticide contaminated eggs and egg products. Chicken eggs were found to contain Fipronil and distributed to 15 European Union countries, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. Approximately 700,000 eggs are thought to have reached shelves in the UK alone.\nEggs at 44 farms in Taiwan were also found with excessive Fipronil levels.\n\n\n"}
