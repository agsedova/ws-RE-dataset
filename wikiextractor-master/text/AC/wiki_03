{"id": "2050495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050495", "title": "Princess Fiona", "text": "Princess Fiona\n\nPrincess Fiona is a fictional character in DreamWorks' \"Shrek\" franchise, first appearing in the animated film \"Shrek\" (2001). One of the film series' main characters, Fiona is introduced as a beautiful princess placed under a curse that transforms her into an ogre at night. She is initially determined to break the enchantment by kissing a prince, only to meet and fall in love with Shrek, an ogre, instead. The character's origins and relationships with other characters are further explored in subsequent films; she introduces her new husband Shrek to her parents in \"Shrek 2\" (2004), becomes a mother by \"Shrek the Third\" (2007), and is an empowered warrior in \"Shrek Forever After\" (2010), much of which takes place in an alternate reality in which Fiona and Shrek never meet.\n\nCreated by screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Fiona is loosely based on the unsightly princess in William Steig's children's book \"Shrek!\" (1990), from which her role and appearance were significantly modified. The screenwriters adapted the character into a princess under a shapeshifting enchantment, an idea initially greatly contested by other filmmakers. Fiona is voiced by actress Cameron Diaz. Comedian and actress Janeane Garofalo was originally cast as the character until she was fired from the first film with little explanation. Fiona was one of the first human characters to have a lead role in a computer-animated film, thus the animators aspired to make her both beautiful and realistic in appearance. However, an early test screening resulted in children reacting negatively towards the character's uncanny realism, prompting the animators to re-design Fiona into a more stylized, cartoonish heroine. Several revolutionary achievements in computer animation were applied to the character to render convincing skin, hair, clothing and lighting.\n\nThe character is considered a parody of traditional princesses in both fairy tales and animated Disney films. Reception towards Fiona has been mostly positive, with critics commending her characterization, martial arts prowess and Diaz's performance. However, reviewers were divided over the character's human design, some of whom were impressed by her technological innovations, while others found her realism unsettling and too similar to Diaz. Several media publications consider Fiona a feminist icon, crediting her with subverting princess and gender stereotypes by embracing her flaws. Diaz also became one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses due to her role in the \"Shrek\" franchise, earning $3 million for her performance in the first film and upwards of $10 million for each sequel.\n\n\"Shrek\" is loosely based on William Steig's children's book \"Shrek!\" (1990), but significantly deviates from its source material, particularly pertaining to its main characters. In Steig's story, a witch foretells that Shrek will marry an unnamed princess, who she describes as uglier in appearance than Shrek himself, enticing the ogre to seek her. Described as \"the most stunningly ugly princess on the surface of the planet\", Steig's princess bears little resemblance to Fiona, but the two characters are immediately attracted to each other and wed with little conflict. Animation historian Maureen Furniss, writing for Animation World Network, identified the fact that Shrek's love interest is altered from \"a really ugly woman\" into a beautiful princess as the film's most significant modification. In an effort to expand the plot while making its characters more visually appealing and marketable \"from a Hollywood\" perspective, the writers decided to adapt \"Shrek!\"'s princess into a beautiful maiden who has been cursed to become ugly only during evenings, which she is forced to conceal from the film's other characters, thus providing \"narrative motivation for not showing her ogre manifestation.\" Furthermore, Furniss observed that Lord Farquaad's romantic interest in Fiona is more practical since he is vain and only attracted to her beauty, while his main motivation remains to marry a princess so that he can rule Duloc.\n\nFeeling that her curse remaining undiscovered until the end was unsuitable for a feature-length film, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio introduced the concept of a shapeshifting princess, which was rejected by the other filmmakers for six months because they found it \"too complex\" for a fairy tale. Elliot and Rossio contested that similar ideas had been used successfully in Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989) and \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991), ultimately convincing the studio by referring to Fiona as an enchanted princess instead. Some writers expressed concerns over whether turning Fiona into an ogre full-time once she professes her love for Shrek suggested \"that ugly people belong with ugly people.\" Rossio explained that since Fiona shape-shifts, the best moral is \"'Even princesses who change their shapes can find love too.' And Shrek would love her in all of her varied forms.\" Elliot elaborated that this prompts audiences to debate if Fiona's \"true form\" is beautiful or unattractive: \"Her true form is beautiful by day, ugly by night.' ... and she was trying to rid herself of part of who she truly was, because society maintained that was wrong.\" The studio ultimately conceded that Fiona remain an ogre, which Elliot considers to be \"a more conventional idea\".\n\nIn early drafts of the script, Fiona is born an ogre to human parents, who lock her in a tower to conceal the true nature of their daughter's appearance, lying to the kingdom that she is a beautiful princess. One day, Fiona escapes and seeks assistance from a witch named Dama Fortuna, who offers her a choice between two potions: one will turn the princess beautiful, while the other guarantees Fiona's happily ever after. Fiona ignorantly drinks the \"Beauty\" potion for which she does not realize there is a catch, as the potion renders her human during the day only to revert her to an ogre every night. The writers originally intended for Fiona's backstory to be fully animated and used as the film's prologue, but discarded the idea after test audiences deemed it too depressing. Entitled \"Fiona's Prologue\", the sequence was storyboarded but never animated. A second abandoned scene entitled \"Fiona Gets Them Lost\" follows Fiona, Shrek and Donkey after she is and they become trapped in a cave; an action sequence inspired by the film \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984) ensues. In the writers' original draft, Fiona's monstrous form was to have a physical altercation reminiscent of Hong Kong action films with Shrek once he discovers her, assuming that the monster has harmed Fiona. The idea was abandoned because, according to Elliot, few were familiar Hong Kong cinema's \"emphasis on action and physicality\" in comparison to more violent American films, explaining, \"no matter how much we described it, [the studio] ... imagined this violent, knock-down, Steven Segal-type, bone-cracking fight\", while some female crew members protested that the concept was misogynistic towards Fiona.\n\nElliott and Rossio had suggested revisiting the discussion about Fiona's true nature is beautiful or an ogre in a potential sequel, but the idea was rejected. The directors spent four months brainstorming several new ideas for the sequel, before ultimately determining that the only logical \"jump off point\" was one of the few areas not explored in the first film: Fiona's parents' reaction to their daughter both marrying and remaining an ogre. \"Shrek 2\" director Kelly Asbury explained that introducing Fiona's parents presented an entirely \"new story to go on, and a whole new place to go.\" Additionally, \"Shrek 2\" reveals why Fiona was locked in a tower in the first place, with the filmmakers realizing they could use some of the first film's abandoned concepts to gradually uncover more details about Fiona's story throughout the remainder of the series. For \"Shrek 2\", the filmmakers decided to resurrect the idea of Dama Fortuna, re-imagining her as Fiona's conniving fairy godmother and the sequel's main villain, who uses magic against Fiona and Shrek's marriage.\n\nFiona is voiced by American actress Cameron Diaz, one of the franchise's three main cast members. Diaz voiced Fiona in all four installments of the film series over the course of ten years. The role was originally intended for comedian and actress Janeane Garofalo, who was fired from the first film and ultimately replaced with Diaz. Garofalo maintains that she was fired without an explanation, joking, \"I assume [it is] because I sound like a man sometimes\". However, it is believed that re-casting Fiona resulted from the death of comedian Chris Farley, who was originally cast as Shrek and had already recorded most of the character's dialogue until he died during production, at which point he was replaced with actor Mike Myers. According to film historian Jim Hill, the filmmakers originally cast Garofalo as Fiona because they had felt that the actress' \"abrasive, sarcastic comic persona\" would serve as an ideal foil to Farley's positive approach to the titular character, but eventually relented that Garofalo was \"too downbeat\" for the film's lighter tone, offering the role to Diaz. With a \"sweeter\" version of Fiona introduced, Shrek was developed into a more pessimistic character. \n\nFiona was Diaz's first animated role. DreamWorks invited Diaz to star in an animated film about an ogre and a princess who learn to accept both themselves and each other. In addition to the film's positive message, Diaz was drawn to the idea of co-starring alongside Myers, Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow. Approaching her role as though it were a dramatic performance, Diaz recorded most of her dialogue before a full script had been written, working closely with director Andrew Adamson to stage scenes before the film had been storyboarded. Prior to \"Shrek\", Diaz starred in the action-comedy film \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), a role for which she had undergone martial arts training. While recording the scene in which her character fights Monsieur Hood and his Merry Men, Diaz became quite animated, gesturing and occasionally uttering Cantonese phrases; her martial arts background is credited with benefiting the sequence. Diaz once burped during a recording session, which was written into a scene for Fiona. Without a proper screenplay to aid her, Diaz found the improvisation required for some scenes one of the most challenging aspects of the recording process. The actress did not see the film's completed story until after she had finished working on the project on-and-off for two years, by which point she finally truly understood her \"character and ... what she was going through\". Myers was both impressed with and inspired by Diaz's commitment to her role, to the point that he felt he was acting opposite Fiona herself. Asbury recalled that Diaz immediately \"nailed\" her character, elaborating, \"She had this certain thing about her voice where she could be headstrong and know exactly what she wants and be confident, but also have this touch of sweet naivete and all make it completely believable.\" Despite admiring the performances of her predominately male co-stars, Diaz seldom worked directly with them throughout the \"Shrek\" series.\n\nDiaz enjoyed \"the good feeling\" she experienced playing Fiona, and preferred voicing her character as an ogre over a princess, the former of which she finds truly beautiful. Apart from the \"Charlie's Angels\" sequel \"\" (2003), \"Shrek\" is the only franchise in which Diaz reprised a role. The origins of Fiona's parents had not yet been disclosed in the first film, therefore Diaz voiced Fiona using an American accent. After discovering that English actors Julie Andrews and John Cleese would voice her parents Queen Lillian and King Harold, respectively, in \"Shrek 2\", Diaz regretted voicing her character with her default Californian accent as opposed to a British accent. She identified her accent as one of the few things she would have changed about her performance in retrospect. Bob Thompson of the \"Ottawa Citizen\" observed that few, if any, critics took issue with Diaz's inconsistency. Although admitting that working on the films for only a few hours at a time sporadically sometimes resulted in her feeling as though she is not \"100 per cent involved ... at the same time, that character is so my character. I feel very possessive of Fiona. It's interesting to see something that's not actually tangible so fully embody your essence. It feels like I've lent something to this film that I could never give to any other film, in a weird way.\" Diaz would often defend Fiona's appearance from the press asking how she feels about playing an \"ugly\" character, explaining, \"It's shocking to me that that's the perception, just because she's big and round ... Her body is everything that she is inside. I love that she is the princess who isn’t like all the other princesses. She doesn’t look like them, and she's just as beloved and accepted.\" In \"Shrek the Third\" (2007), Diaz co-starred alongside her ex-boyfriend, singer Justin Timberlake, with whom she had broken up the previous year. Timberlake plays her character's cousin Arthur Pendragon, heir to her late father's throne. \"Shrek 2\" features a brief reference to Timberlake; a picture of a young knight named \"Sir Justin\" appears in Fiona's childhood bedroom, which is believed to be a reference to their relationship. Diaz was unaware of Timberlake's cameo until watching the film, believing it had been finalized before they were a couple. Although Timberlake was initially cast as Arthur while he was still dating Diaz, producer Aron Warner maintains that Timberlake's involvement was not influenced by their relationship, insisting that he earned the role based on his own merit and comedic timing. The film's May 2007 premiere in Los Angeles was the first media event at which the former couple had been photographed since the end of their relationship. Director Mike Mitchell denied media speculation that Timberlake and his character's omission from \"Shrek Forever After\" (2010) correlated to Diaz and Timberlake's breakup, explaining that Arthur was written out solely to allow more screen time for more relevant characters.\n\nA filmmaker described Diaz as \"the rock\" of the franchise because \"She brings such a great spirit to these movies.” Following the release of \"Shrek Forever After\", the series' final installment, Diaz reflected that the \"Shrek\" films had remained her \"safety net\" for several years, describing the period as \"a decade of knowing that you finish one and for the next two years we'll be making another one\". She remains hopeful for future sequels, joking, \"I'm ready for 'Shrek 18,' if they haven't killed Fiona off by then.\" Diaz was saddened to bid farewell to her character, admitting that she took the films and Fiona for granted until the end because she always assumed she would be invited back within a few months for another installment. Considering the role \"a privilege and honor\", Diaz maintains that Fiona is the role for which she is most recognized by children, but she prefers when parents allow them to pretend that her character truly exists without revealing her voice actress, often attempting to prevent parents from exposing the truth. Diaz elaborated that Fiona has become \"part of my screen persona. Rather than me putting myself through her I think she comes through me in a weird way. When people think of me they think of Fiona, it's not the other way around.\" Diaz believes that her popularity has greatly increased since voicing the character. Despite being currently in development, Diaz has yet to confirm whether or not she will reprise her role in a fifth film, although she had previously said that she would return for a fifth installment if asked.\n\nDiaz's role in the \"Shrek\" series is believed to have contributed to her becoming one of Hollywood's wealthiest actresses by 2008. After being paid $3 million for the first film, Diaz originally re-negotiated to receive $5 million for \"Shrek 2\", estimated to be an hourly salary of $35,000. She ultimately earned between $10 to $15 million for reprising her role. For \"Shrek the Third\", Diaz was paid $30 million, her highest salary at that point, due to securing a significant portion of the installment's profits. She earned $10 million for \"Shrek Forever After\". In 2010, \"Forbes\" ranked Diaz Hollywood's second highest-earning voice actor, behind only Myers. On the actress' lucrative earnings, filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis wrote in an article for the \"Sun-Sentinel\" \"Sure, she captured the character well. Yes, the 'Shrek' movies invariably are box office successes. But can anyone say that if the voice of Princess Fiona were that of a competent actress other than Cameron Diaz, the movie would have flopped?\" Actress Holly Fields has provided the character's singing voice in the film, in addition to voicing the character in several video games, toys, commercials and amusement park rides. Fields is often hired to imitate Diaz, describing the experience as one of her \"coolest jobs\".\n\nFiona is the franchise's female lead and Shrek's romantic interest. \"Shrek\" was the first computer-animated film to feature human characters in lead roles, thus director Vicki Jenson believed its heroine should be beautiful yet convincing. Elliott and Rossio had originally envisioned Fiona's monstrous form as furry in appearance, wanting her to resemble an entirely unique character as opposed to simply a female version of Shrek, but the filmmakers struggled to agree upon her final design. Aiming to achieve stylized realism, the animators found that they could emphasize Fiona's face most efficiently by focusing \"on the subtleties of the human form\" and compiling translucent layers of skin to prevent the character from resembling plastic, a task they found particularly daunting due to people's familiarity with human skin. To make Fiona's skin more believable, the animators studied dermatology books to learn how various light sources interact with human skin, which visual effects supervisor Ken Bielenberg approached as though they were lighting Diaz herself. Bielenberg joked, \"You want the sunset to reflect off her face in a way that's flattering ... Fiona may be a computerized princess, but she has her bad side.\" The animators painted a combination of freckles and warmer tones onto some of her skin's deeper layers, through which they then filtered light. A shader was used to penetrate, refract and re-emerge layers of light, the concentration of which was adjusted to achieve Fiona's desired radiance; they learned that too much exposure resulted in a mannequin-like appearance. The lighting department consulted with makeup artist Patty York to learn different approaches to creating realistic effects on Fiona's face, while the computer graphics software Maya was used to animate her hair, which consists of more than 1 million polygons. The animators felt that Fiona's design was \"too real\" at times. When the film was previewed to test audiences, some children cried because they found Fiona's hyperrealism disturbing; the character was suffering from a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley. Consequently, DreamWorks ordered that the character be re-animated to appear more like a cartoon and less like a human simulation. Animator Lucia Modesto recalled that her team was instructed to \"pull back\" on the character's design because her realism was growing unpleasant. Subsequently, Fiona was modified to fit in among the film's more fantastical characters, which supervising animator Raman Hui credits with improving the believability of Fiona and Shrek's relationship. To make Fiona a more \"cartoony-looking love interest,\" the animators enlarged her eyes and smoothed her skin. Hui acknowledged that Fiona was much more difficult to animate as a human because any errors were quite apparent. In total, Fiona's face required a year of constant experimentation before the animators were satisfied with her final design: a realistic yet softer interpretation of the princess.\n\nDirector Andrew Adamson admitted that making Fiona beautiful yet viscerally familiar posed several unique challenges for the filmmakers. For example, her eyebrows sometimes cast shadows over her eyes, while her upturned lip and large eyes resulted in a \"spooky\" appearance. They wanted Fiona's appearance to be relatable without \"stick[ing] out among Shrek and the other fantastic characters and distract from the fairy-tale mood.\" Adamson identified Fiona as the film's most difficult character to animate due to people's familiarity with human mannerisms and expressions, whereas audiences are not nearly as accustomed to talking animals, such as Donkey. Hui maintains that Fiona's appearance was not based on that of any specific individual. Although the animators wanted to avoid making the character resemble Diaz too closely, elements of the actress's movements and mannerisms, which were videotaped during recording sessions, were incorporated into Fiona nonetheless, which they drew onto a different face to create a unique new character. Studying Diaz's mannerisms inspired the animators to exaggerate Fiona's expressions and reactions, instead of striving for realism. For example, Adamson believes Fiona squinting her eyes and compressing her lips while listening to someone else offers \"a richness you’ve never seen before”, despite their difficulty to animate. Diaz was shocked and ran out of the studio screaming joyfully when she saw her character animated to her voice for the first time. Although Diaz did not think the character resembles her, she recognized that Fiona had many of her mannerisms in addition to her own voice, appearing \"more real than she had imagined\". The actress explained that \"the experience was so weird she felt like she was watching some kind of strange sister.\" Fiona's body consists of 90 muscles, but her entire model is made up of more than 900 movable muscles. Even in her ogre form, Fiona is significantly smaller than Shrek, with layout supervisor Nick Walker confirming that Shrek is capable of swallowing Fiona's head whole.\n\nActor Antonia Banderas, who voices Puss in Boots, originally found it challenging to accept Fiona's unconventional appearance. Banderas explained that he experienced \"a certain resistance as a spectator for her to be an ogre\", initially wishing for her and Shrek to end the film as humans before finally accepting the character's appearance and sequel's ending. The actor believes several audience members \"went through this process when they were observing this movie\" because \"We are used to rejecting ugliness without reason.” Costume designer Isis Mussenden designed the character's costumes for the first two \"Shrek\" films, for which she helped develop new technology to animate clothing in the then-new computer animation medium. The filmmakers wanted a more realistic approach to costumes than previous computer animated films, in which clothing was typically depicted as a tight layer over the figure, adorned with a few wrinkles. The filmmakers had envisioned Fiona's velvet gown as one that moves independently from her body, therefore one of the film's producers recruited Mussenden, with whom they had worked prior, to assist them with the process. Mussenden began by creating a one-quarter scale replica of the skirt. To determine the gown's volume, fullness and where certain areas would rest on the character's form, the costume designer worked with both a pattern maker and designer. The patterns and seams were labeled and forwarded to the animators, who would replicate the images on the computer. Mussenden decided to give Fiona's dresses tight sleeves as opposed to the long, flowing sleeves associated with traditional medieval clothing due to the difficulty the latter would have been for the animators. Unlike \"Shrek\", Fiona has several costume changes in \"Shrek 2\". In the sequel, both Fiona's ogre and human forms are shown wearing the same green dress. To ensure that both forms looked equally flattering in the same outfit, Mussenden lowered the dress' waistline to make it more medieval in appearance than the costume she wears in the first film. Fiona's first costume is a lilac dress, which Mussenden designed to appear \"organic and textured, because she's been living in the swamp\". Towards the end of the film, she changes into a white ballgown with rhinestones inspired by an image of a 1958 dress the costume designer had found.\n\nThe scene in which Fiona single-handedly defeats Monsieur Hood and his Merry Men references the slow motion special effects popularized by \"The Matrix\" (1999), as well as Diaz's own \"Charlie's Angels\" films. In a DVD bonus feature, Fiona explains that she performed her own stunts in the film, claiming that she based her kung fu on \"Charlie's Angels\". Despite concerns that references to \"The Matrix\" would eventually date the film, Rossio believes the gag will remain funny because it is a parody instead of merely an imitation. A similar reference is made when Fiona defeats a mob at the beginning of \"Shrek 2\", a complex sequence for which animators used powerful data processors to store and manipulate millions of computer generated images. Modesto created new character models for Fiona and Shrek in \"Shrek the Third\", while new software and servers were implemented to animate individual strands of the princess's hair much faster than had been possible during production of the first film. In \"Shrek Forever After\"'s alternate reality, the character wears her hair unbraided for the first time, which was inspired by singer Janis Joplin. Due to its costliness, Fiona's new hairstyle first needed to be approved by DreamWorks, with Mitchell likening the process to \"prepar[ing] like a lawyer\". The re-design was a difficult, expensive process that required 20 animators to animate each strand individually, as Mitchell was particularly determined to render it correctly due to audiences' familiarity with long hair. One group was specifically tasked with setting up Fiona's hair, which head of production technology Darin Grant believes \"allowed the process to be optimized and work across many, many shots\" as it \"flows and cascades throughout\" the entire film, reinforcing Fiona's liberated personality.\n\nAccording to Rossio, the first film's four main characters are written \"around the concept of self-esteem, and appropriate and/or inappropriate reactions to appropriate or inappropriate self-assessment\", explaining that Fiona seeks validation from others because she believes \"there's something not correct about herself\". Adamson elaborated that the character's main issue revolves around living up to stereotypes and ideas \"represented in fairy tales that if ... you look a certain way and act a certain way and put the right dress and slippers on a handsome man is going to come\", dismissing this as an unrealistic and unhealthy approach to finding romance. Diaz confirmed that Fiona only becomes her true self once she is freed from the tower and realizes her Prince Charming differs from who she had been taught to expect.\n\nA scene during which Fiona duets with a bird who explodes once the princess sings a high note, subsequently frying its eggs for breakfast, is considered to be a parody of Disney fairy tales such as \"Cinderella\" (1950), about which Adamson explained \"pok[es] fun at people's expectations\" of princesses. Diaz believes her character's personality \"shattered\" children's perception of princess characters from the moment she was freed from the tower, explaining that Fiona had always been capable of freeing herself but chose to remain in the tower solely because she was \"following the rules of a fairy tale book\". In the sequel, Diaz explained that Fiona \"has a lot of pressure from all the people who told her about Prince Charming to take everything materialistically and monetarily. And she literally is just kind of baffled by it and says, 'Sorry, but I don't need any of those things.' All she needs is this man who she loves and loves her and accepts her.\" Diaz considers her character to be an empowered, positive role model for young girls, explaining, \"She's never depended on anyone to rescue her, which is a different message from Snow White and Rapunzel ... She was capable of getting out of the tower herself\" and \"took on Shrek as her partner rather than as her rescuer.\" She believes that the moment she accepts herself as an ogre is her most empowered moment, as well as \"the biggest stride in her evolution as a person\".\n\nDiaz considers Fiona to be \"the anchor that holds all these kooky characters\", identifying her as the comedy's straight man. Revealing that she \"hate[s] naggy women\", Diaz sometimes found herself wishing that Fiona would be \"less naggy\" and more compassionate and understanding towards the difficult changes Shrek is undergoing since marrying her. During production of \"Shrek the Third\", Diaz observed that the filmmakers had made Fiona into more of a nag and asked that they tone this down, explaining, \"just because she got married it doesn't mean she has to become a nag'.\" This was one of only a few things Diaz asked that they adjust about Fiona. In \"Shrek Forever After\"'s alternate reality, Fiona frees herself from the tower on her own and subsequently becomes a warrior and leader of an army of ogres, which some commentators found to be a more empowering approach to the princess; Diaz contested that her character has \"always been a warrior ... of love through all these films. What she’s worked for, what she’s fought for is the love that she has for herself and the love that she has for Shrek and her family and her friends.\" Diaz concluded that, due to the fourth film's tone, Fiona's responsibilities are simply more apparent, believing that in this film she is \"fighting for what she believes in.\"\n\nTodd Anthony of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" cited Fiona among several elements that make \"Shrek\" resemble an archetypal fairy tale initially. Furniss identified Fiona's character arc as struggling with insecurities about her identity and appearance before finally \"accept[ing] herself in a so-called 'ugly' physical manifestation\", which she described as merely \"cute\" as opposed to \"push[ing] the boundaries of true ugliness.\" Demonstrated by her \"very definite ideas about how she wants to be rescued,\" Bob Waliszewski of \"Plugged In\" believes Fiona \"has bought into the conventions of fairy tale romanticism hook, line and sinker\", writing, \"Her skewed perspective on love and marriage undermines agape love and spiritual discernment in relationships.\" Similarly, \"TV Guide\" film critic Frank Lovece described Fiona as a \"beautiful and headstrong princess\" who has spent too much time thinking about true love. Michael Sragow, film critic for \"The Baltimore Sun\", agreed that the character is \"fixated on being treated like a fairy-tale princess\", resulting in a precarious outlook on reality. Although Fiona is originally disappointed upon discovering her rescuer is not a Prince Charming, her expectations are more-so grounded in \"rituals of self-loathing\". Furniss believes Fiona's story is targeted towards Disney films in which princesses are constantly rescued from \"horrible fates by knights\". However, despite her efforts to look, speak and behave like a traditional princess, Fiona is soon proven to be an nontraditional princess, exemplified by her traits as a skilled fighter, unusual diet occasionally consisting of wild animals and tendency to belch spontaneously.\n\nJames Clarke, author of \"Animated Films - Virgin Film\", described Fiona as \"both an old-school and new-school heroine, in love with the notion of a charming prince who will rescue her but also tough talking and tough acting\". Although she originally possesses traits associated with a traditional princess, being tall and slender, both Shrek and audiences soon agree that Fiona is different, and the princess is merely \"following a script from a storybook\" herself. Paul Byrnes of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" wrote that Fiona's depiction in the first film offers \"a sense of how gender roles had shifted\" by resembling \"a bottom-kicking heroine\". Among her unusual characteristics, John Anderson of \"Newsday\" observed that Fiona is \"perfectly capable of taking care of herself. She's just been waiting for some classic romance.\" Although in the context of the film Shrek initially observes Fiona's differences once she belches, \"it rapidly also becomes apparent that she is indeed not a prototypical fairy-tale princess\", according to author Johnny Unger. The \"New York Press\" observed that \"Shrek\" emphasizes \"that the ogre falls in love with the heroine not because of her conventional good looks, but in spite of them ... looking past Fiona's skinny, blond human surface and seeing the belching, bug-eating ogre beneath.\" Journalist Steve Sailer, writing for UPI, similarly wrote that \"Fiona wins Shrek's heart by belching, beating up Robin Hood's Merry Men (who act like Broadway chorus boys) with cool \"Matrix\"-style kung fu, and cooking the Blue Bird of Happiness' eggs for breakfast.\" Elliot believes that Fiona's storyline explores \"the actual prevalence of attitudes about appearance in society\", identifying a theme of lacking self-esteem as particularly prevalent with Fiona. Film critic Emanuel Levy shared that \"Fiona suffers/benefits from duality\", transitioning from a \"sexy, opinionated, and feisty\" character into an outcast once \"her secret is revealed\", after which she becomes closer to Shrek. Matt Zoller Seitz, film critic for the \"New York Press\", wrote that Fiona takes the film's metaphor pertaining the people \"passing for something they're not\" to \"a whole different level\", explaining, \"At first you think she's a standard-issue princess who's willing to let her hair down and hang with the riffraff\", describing her as \"a modern-day Disney heroine.\" Seitz also observed \"interracial overtones\" in Fiona and Shrek's relationship.\n\n\"PopMatters\" contributor Evan Sawdey wrote that the \"Shrek\" films use Fiona to promote acceptance, particularity the moment she \"discovers that her true form is that of an ogre\", by which she is not saddened. Believing that Fiona would happily battle and defend whatever she loves or believes in, Diaz identified the character as \"the anchor everyone has attached themselves to\", to whom Shrek looks to for guidance, which she would not have been able to provide unless she possessed the strength herself. In terms of character development and evolvement, Diaz recalled that, despite having been raised in a \"storybook life\", Fiona eventually comes to terms with the fact that \"her Prince Charming didn’t come in the package she thought he would. She’s learned to have patience with Shrek, accept him for who he his\", particularly going against being taught that her Prince Charming must look and act a certain way. Thus, Adamson considers Fiona to be \"an empowering character\" for young girls. Unlike Farquaad, Shrek respects Fiona for speaking up for and defending herself. Fiona's final transformation sequence in which she transforms into an ogre permanently is considered to be a parody and critique of the Beast's transformation into a human in Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991), with Fiona coming to realize that her \"true love's true form\" is in fact an ogre. Novelist and film critic Jeffrey Overstreet considered it to be \"part of society’s downfall that we embrace the Princess Fionas when they’re glamorous rather than real.\" Film critic Roger Ebert observed that Fiona is the only princess competing to be Farquaad's bride (opposite Cinderella and Snow White) who \"who has not had the title role in a Disney animated feature\", which he considered to be \"inspired by feelings DreamWorks partner Jeffrey Katzenberg has nourished since his painful departure from Disney\".\n\nIn a review for \"Salon\", film critic Stephanie Zacharek observed that Fiona \"has two little frecklelike beauty spots, one on her cheek and one on her upper chest\", which she interpreted as \"symbols of her human authenticity, but they also serve as a sort of factory trademark left by her creators: 'You see, we've thought of every last detail.'\" Rick Groen of \"The Globe and Mail\" observed that Fiona \"appears to replicate the body of Cameron Diaz\", describing her as \"a cute brunette with a retroussé nose, ample curves, and cleavage that broadens whenever she bends low in her scoop-neck frock.\" Fiona is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts. \"The New York Times\" journalist A. J. Jacobs wrote that Fiona's kung fu skills rival those of actor Bruce Lee, abilities she is explained to have inherited from her mother Queen Lillian. Describing Fiona as tough and clever, museum curator Sarah Tutton observed that, despite being a love interest, the character \"doesn’t play the typical supporting role ... Just because Princess Fiona subverts the idea of beauty, it doesn’t mean that beauty is not important. It means that the film isn’t taking it as a cliche.\" In the third film, Fiona teaches the classic princesses, who are naturally inclined to \"to assume passive positions\", not to wait for their princes to rescue them, making them over into action heroines themselves when Prince Charming takes over the kingdom while teaching them to stand up for themselves. Several critics considered this moment to be about girl power and female empowerment, as well as a \"Charlie's Angels\" reference. Diaz believes that the films and her character \"retain the best qualities of\" classic fairy tale characters, \"infusing them with contemporary wit, style and relevance\" for a more contemporary generation. Diaz elaborated, \"We do love those girls ... But now they have a whole new life. They can exist in our current culture, our pop culture again ... Where before, they were forgotten. It’s a celebration of them. It’s a rebirth.” Furthermore, Diaz believes that the princesses' independence is a positive message for both women and men, interpreting it as \"a message for everyone … You have to be proactive in your own life.\" Miller believes that Fiona's skills as a martial artist prove naturally beneficial to her adjustment to motherhood because \"she can use her whole body. She’s very adaptable.”\n\nFiona first appears in \"Shrek\" (2001) as a bride chosen by Lord Farquaad, who intends to marry the princess solely so that he can become King of Duloc. In order to regain ownership of his swamp, Shrek and Donkey agree to retrieve Fiona from her dragon-guarded tower and deliver her to Farquaad. Fiona is rescued successfully but disappointed upon discovering that Shrek is an ogre instead of a knight, proceeding to act coldly towards him at the beginning of their journey back to Duloc. However, her attitude softens once she overhears Shrek explain that he is constantly misjudged by his appearance, and the two gradually develop a camaraderie as Fiona falls in love with Shrek. Late one evening, Donkey discovers that Fiona is under an enchantment that transforms her into an ogre every night, and she wishes to break the spell by kissing Farquaad before the next sunset. When she finally decides to tell Shrek the truth the following morning, she learns that Shrek has already summoned Farquaad to take her back to Duloc himself, having overheard and misinterpreted some of her conversation with Donkey. The princess and ogre part ways, Fiona returning to Duloc with Farquaad and Shrek returning to his swamp alone. Shrek and Donkey soon interrupt Fiona and Farquaad's wedding ceremony, where Shrek professes his love for her. With the sun setting, Fiona allows herself to transform into an ogre in front of Shrek for the first time, prompting Farquaad to threaten to lock her back in her tower for eternity. However, the dragon that had once imprisoned Fiona eats Farquaad, killing him. Fiona finally confesses her feelings for Shrek and, upon kissing him, turns into an ogre full-time; the two ogres marry.\n\nIn \"Shrek 2\" (2004), Fiona and Shrek return home from their honeymoon to find that Fiona's parents are inviting them to the kingdom of Far, Far Away to celebrate and bless their marriage. Shrek is apprehensive about meeting his parents-in-law, but Fiona insists. Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, are surprised to find that their daughter married an ogre, with Harold acting particularly coldly towards his new son-in-law, which in turn strains Fiona and Shrek's relationship. When a tearful Fiona unintentionally summons her Fairy Godmother, who discovers that the princess married someone other than Prince Charming – her own son – she conspires with Harold to kill Shrek and trick Fiona into falling in love with Charming, as per their original agreement. Fiona is briefly returned to her human form when Shrek consumes a potion that turns both him and his true love beautiful, but Shrek must obtain a kiss from Fiona before midnight, otherwise the spell will revert. However, Fairy Godmother, from whom Shrek steals the potion, tricks Fiona into believing Charming is Shrek's human form. Despite their efforts, Fiona continues to resent Charming's impression of her husband to the point where Fairy Godmother imprisons Shrek and insists that Harold feed Fiona a potion that will force her to fall in love with whomever she kisses first, intending for this to be Charming. However, the king refuses upon seeing how unhappy Fiona has become, thwarting Fairy Godmother's plan. Fairy Godmother and Charming are defeated by Fiona, Shrek and their friends. Although Shrek offers to kiss Fiona so that they can remain human forever, Fiona refuses, insisting that she would rather spend forever with the ogre she fell in love with and married, and they turn back into ogres.\n\nIn \"Shrek the Third\" (2007), Fiona and Shrek take on the roles of acting Queen and King of Far, Far Away while Harold is ill. When Harold passes away, Shrek is reluctantly named next-in-line to Harold's throne, a position he declines because becoming king would prevent him and Fiona from returning to their swamp. Determined to locate a suitable heir, Shrek sets out to recruit Fiona's cousin Arthur Pendragon to convince him to assume the throne. Before Shrek departs, Fiona finally reveals that she is pregnant, forcing Shrek to come to terms with the idea of fatherhood. While Shrek, Donkey and Puss venture to Camelot to recruit Arthur, Fiona remains at Far, Far Away, where her princess friends Rapunzel, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and her stepsister Doris host a baby shower for her. The shower is interrupted by Prince Charming, still bitter over losing both the kingdom and Fiona to Shrek. Charming stages an invasion so that he can proclaim himself king of Far Far Away. Instead of waiting to be rescued, an idea that Fiona finds appalling, she encourages the princesses to free themselves and fight back. After escaping the dungeon, Fiona, Lillian and the princesses (albeit Rapunzel, who has betrayed them to marry Charming) organize a resistance to defend themselves and the kingdom. Artie makes a speech to convince the villains to go straight. In the end, Fiona and Shrek return to the swamp, where Fiona gives birth to ogre triplets named Felicia, Fergus and Farkle.\n\n\"Shrek Forever After\" (2010) reveals that, during the events of the first film, Fiona's parents had nearly lost the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin, nearly signing it over in return for their daughter's freedom, but his plans are thwarted when Fiona is rescued by and falls in love with Shrek. Fiona confronts Shrek, who has grown frustrated with his mundane repetitive life since becoming a father, about losing his temper during their children's birthday; a heated argument between the two prompts Shrek to wish he had never rescued Fiona from the tower, a comment by which Fiona is hurt. When Shrek makes his deal with Rumpelstiltskin, for a single day he is taken to an alternate reality where he was never born. Here, Rumpelstiltskin has seized power by tricking Fiona's parents out of ruling the kingdom of Far Far Away. Since Shrek never frees Fiona from the tower, she remains under the witch's spell – human by day and ogre by night – and has subsequently become the leader of a group of Ogre resistance fighters. Shrek initially believes his relationship with Fiona still exists there but when she doesn't even recognize him, he finally accepts completely that the reality he is in is not his own and that Rumpelstiltskin has truly altered reality to be as if he never existed until now. Fiona is shown to still be kindhearted and caring but bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love, because she was never rescued from her tower, having grown traumatized from her years of solitary imprisonment. She begins to fall in love with him again when he starts training with her, but still does not kiss him (having only started to find him likable). But Fiona's attitude towards Shrek changes as she and the other ogres head off to take down Rumpelstiltskin once and for all. During the day, Shrek realizes that a loophole will negate the deal if he can receive a True Love's kiss from Fiona. After a failed attempt, they realize that he has succeeded when Fiona's curse has been broken. The timeline returns to normal, and Shrek returns to his children's birthday party before he lashed out at everybody and warmly greets Fiona.\n\nFiona has appeared in two holiday-themed television specials: \"Shrek the Halls\" (2007) and \"Scared Shrekless\" (2010). The animated short \"Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!\" (2001) is included on home video releases of \"Shrek\", featuring several of the film's characters performing covers of well-known songs. In the short, Fiona sings an excerpt from Madonna's song \"Like a Virgin\" (1984). Fiona appears in the short \"Shrek 4-D\", a 4-D film originally shown at various amusement and theme parks. The short was renamed \"Shrek 3-D\" and \"The Ghost of Lord Farquaad\" for home video and streaming service releases. In it, Fiona and Shrek's honeymooning plans are interrupted by Farquaad's ghost, who kidnaps Fiona and intends to kill the princess so that he can marry her ghost in the afterlife. Shrek and Donkey pursue Farquaad determined to rescue her, assisted by Dragon. Fiona appears in the short film \"Far, Far Away Idol\", a parody of the reality television singing competition \"American Idol\", which is included as a bonus feature on home video releases of \"Shrek 2\". First serving as a judge alongside Shrek and an animated version of \"American Idol\" judge Simon Cowell, offering feedback about the other characters performances, Fiona eventually duets The Romantics' \"What I Like About You\" with Shrek.\n\nFiona appeared in the stage musical adaptation of the film, which ran on Broadway from 2008 to 2010. The role was originated by actress Sutton Foster, who had been involved in the project three years before its premiere, having learned about it from composer Jeanine Tesori and director Jason Moore. She was drawn towards the idea of playing a princess for the first time, the prospect of which she found \"fun\", as well as the opportunity to collaborate with lyricist and librettist David Lindsay-Abaire. Actresses Keaton Whittaker and Marissa O'Donnell portrayed younger versions of the character. Before production, Foster described Fiona as an atypical princess who is \"a little bipolar, but rightfully so\" having \"grown up, like we all have, with ideas of how the world works\" while trying to surround herself with, and emulate, fairy tales. Foster believes Fiona constantly struggles with her \"inner ogre\" despite trying to be perfect. \"Everything she's been told is that she's supposed to look a certain way and act a certain way, but everything on the inside is telling her something different.\" Although Fiona longs to be a \"proper princess\", Foster identifies herself as \"more of a tomboy\", while Fiona's body contradicts with her desires: \"as soon as she starts farting and burping, she has a really great time! And I just love that, that she finds herself in just having fun with an ogre, with Shrek. And I love that she falls in love with him through something crude.\" Foster found it \"fun to play a truly conflicted character and to be a princess who burps and farts and gets to do silly things.\" Foster earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. Despite being a fan of the musical adaption, Diaz has stated that she has no intention of reprising her role on stage.\n\nDuring early press screenings, critics were amused by Fiona's bluebird scene to the point where they laughed hysterically. David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" reported that the sequence consistently \"sends audiences into fits of delight\". \"Time\" film critic Richard Schickel called Fiona \"an excellent character,\" highlighting her confrontation with Monsieur Hood. Similarly, the \"New York Post\" film critic Lou Lumenick identified Fiona's encounters with Monsieur Hood and the bluebird as clever, delightful \"sendups of a long line of Disney classics\". Kelly Vance of the \"East Bay Express\" wrote, \"Armed with Diaz' vocal portrayal ... Fiona is more charming, more vulnerable, perkier, and even more sensitive than if she were played by a human actress.\" Film critic Emanuel Levy believes \"Shrek\" benefits from Fiona, writing that \"Diaz applies well skills she had acquired for \"Charlie's Angels\"\". Hollywood.com's Robert Sims joked that \"Fiona could teach Charlie's Angels a lesson or two in romance and survival skills.\" Malcolm Johnson of the \"Hartford Courant\" lauded Fiona as \"a marvel, as beautiful and shapely as a real star but capable of moves that go beyond the wirework in \"The Matrix\".\" Johnson continued, \"Every turn of Fiona's head, every glance, every shift of mouth lift character animation to new heights.\" Similarly, the \"London Evening Standard\" wrote that \"every bright ringlet on Princess Fiona ... the liquefaction flow of her velvet robe, even her skin tones have the feel of organic root, thread or cell.\" \"Slant Magazine\"'s Ed Gonzalez identified Fiona's struggles with self-loathing as the film's strongest asset. Reviewing \"Shrek the Third\", \"Entertainment Weekly\" film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum described Fiona as \"fabulously resourceful\", identifying the moment she reinvents her princess friends into independent women as the film's sole \"Cool Thing.\"\n\nDiaz has also received positive attention for her voice acting. \"The Washington Post\" film critic Desson Howe wrote that Diaz's performance offers \"a funny, earthy princess.\" \"GamesRadar+\" wrote Fiona \"nestle[s] comfortably between the movie's storybook style and photo-realistic convincingness,\" continuing that Diaz's performance \"reinforces her game-for-a-laugh reputation\". Kim Morgan of OregonLive.com said, \"Diaz's sweet yet tough demeanor shines through all her computer-generated-imagery beauty,\" citing her vulnerability as an asset. \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s film critic Andrew O'Hagan believes Diaz imbues Fiona with \"easygoing shrillness that modern eight-year-olds may find likeable\", while the \"Deseret News\"' Jeff Vice wrote that Diaz proves more than merely \"a pretty face.\" Bruce Westbrook of the \"Houston Chronicle\" reviewed Diaz as an improvement upon \"the spunkiness of today's heroines\" by \"packing surprise punches that would have suited her role in \"Charlie's Angels\"\". Turner Classic Movies believes Diaz's performance earned the actress \"a legion of younger fans\", a sentiment with which \"TV Guide\" agreed. \"PopMatters\"' Cynthia Fuchs, reviewing the fourth film, described the princess as \"always at least a little wonderful, patient, and smart (and now awesomely Amazonian),\" and found herself wishing Fiona would discover a parallel universe in which she is truly appreciated.\n\nNot all reviews were positive. Finding Fiona's fight scene unnecessary, Derek Armstrong of AllMovie wrote that it \"leaves things feeling scattershot\" despite its appealing visuals. In a negative review, CNN's Paul Tatara dismissed Fiona as \"bland\" and the film's \"only miscue among the characters\". Criticizing her design, Tatara felt the princess \"gives off the creepy air of a possessed Barbie Doll\" while \"Diaz's California-girl line readings simply don't fit the character.\" Similarly, the \"Chicago Tribune\"'s Mark Caro found Fiona's design generic and Barbie-like, but admitted these characteristics benefit the film's plot and themes. Anthony Quinn of \"The Independent\" found Fiona's realism particularly troubling, suggesting that the animators should have simply \"invite[d] Cameron Diaz to play her as well as voice her.\" Similarly, \"The New Yorker\" film critic Anthony Lane felt the character was too realistic, writing, \"What I don't want is to gaze at Princess Fiona ... and wonder if she is supposed to resemble Cameron Diaz\". Peter Bradshaw, film critic for \"The Guardian\", dismissed Fiona and the film's human characters as \"disappointingly ordinary looking and unexpressive,\" comparing them to claymation, while \"New York\"'s Peter Rainer agreed that human characters such as Fiona \"are less interesting\". Paul Malcolm of \"LA Weekly\" described Diaz's performance as \"insuperably flat\". Philippa Hawker of \"The Age\" felt the third film could benefited from Fiona being named Harold's heir, opposing the idea of relegating her to \"a cursory girl-power scenario\".\n\nSome media publications have regarded Fiona as a feminist icon. Upon her debut, Fiona was celebrated by most critics \"as a radical new take on the princess myth\". Fiona's subversion of common princess tropes continues to be widely discussed in the media. \"Wired\" contributor Claudia Puig felt the first film boasts \"a wonderfully affirming message for girls courtesy of Fiona\". Jack Rear, writing for Pretty 52, described Fiona as \"feminism goals\" due to her martial arts proficiency. \"Affinity Magazine\" contributor Isabel Tovar identified the moment Fiona defeats Monsieur Hood as \"female empowering\", believing \"Fiona has been feminist queen since day one.\" Teresa Brickey of \"The Odyssey\" said Fiona contested the patriarchy by \"accept[ing] her body ... who she loved, and fought for right to do her thing.\" Reviewing \"Shrek Forever After\", Rachel Giese of CBC found the character's \"girl-power turn as a warrior princess\" to be one of the installment's most endearing changes. Crowning the character \"the best feminist action hero around\", Emily Shire of \"The Week\" deemed Fiona \"the kind of feminist action hero movies need more of\", describing her as a strong heroine who \"saves herself and loved ones\" while accepting the \"'ugly' and 'gross' aspects of herself\". Shire also voiced her preference for Fiona over \"The Hunger Games\"' Katniss Everdeen and the superheroine Wonder Woman. Allison Maloney of The Shriver Report shared Shire's sentiments. Felicity Sleeman, a writer for \"Farrago\", believes \"Fiona completely dispels any misconceptions of the passive princess trope\", citing her as a strong female character \"able to stand up for herself and fight in ways that would typically be considered masculine.\" Sleeman continued that one of the most important components of Fiona's personality \"is that the films don’t ignore or degrade any of her qualities that are considered typically feminine\", elaborating that her struggles over her appearance are \"significant in that it presents the ways in which so many girls are pressured by society to uphold a certain standard of beauty.\" Sleeman concluded, \"In an industry where female characters have so often portrayed as secondary characters defined by their beauty ... Fiona is a well-rounded character who represents an eclectic mix of traits that are representative of real women\", remaining feminine yet strong. Rachel O'Neill, a writer for \"The Daily Edge\", identified Fiona as \"the first badass princess ... able to speak for herself\", joking, \"nobody can fling a mermaid quite like Fiona.\"\n\nIn 2008, BBC News named Fiona \"the next feminist icon\", believing the character retains \"a certain sex appeal which continues even after she changes into an ogre - perfectly underlining how attitudes have changed towards women in the 21st Century.\" \"HuffPost\" contributor Hayley Krischer cited Fiona as a rare example of a princess who \"br[oke] the mold\". Iona Tytler of Babe.net recognized Fiona among childhood feminist characters \"who got you where you are today\". Praising her independence, Tytler said Fiona \"overc[ame] the societal prejudice in her world that came with being an ogre\" while becoming \"more comfortable in her own skin.\" Sarah Tutton, curator of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image's DreamWorks exhibit, credits Fiona with \"br[eaking] the mould of the helpless princess,\" citing her as a modern-day feminist. Tutton also said the character \"completely subverts what it means to be a beautiful princess.\" \"Forbes\" contributor Dani Di Placido believes Fiona embodied characteristics associated with the unconventional, rebellious warrior princess several years before such traits became standard in film and television. Similarly, the British Film Institute's So Mayer wrote that heroines such as Merida and Elsa from Disney's \"Brave\" (2012) and \"Frozen\" (2013), respectively, were both \"late to the party compared to\" Fiona, reflecting, \"over the course of the trilogy she wanders the wilderness, turns down Lord Farquaad, survives imprisonment, decides she prefers being ogre to being human, and organises a resistance composed of fairytale princesses.\" Furthermore, \"Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television\" author Gladys L. Knight wrote that Fiona challenged the manner in which medieval women are portrayed on screen. Mary Zeiss Stange, author of \"Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1\", cited Fiona as an example of an \"outstanding female action hero\".\"Refinery 29\"'s Anne Cohen felt Fiona remains a strong heroine despite \"Shrek\"'s \"un-feminist plot\" featuring several men making decisions about her future without her involvement. Cohen praised Fiona for defending herself, defying stereotypes, speaking her mind and accepting her own flaws. Crowing Fiona an \"important cultural milestone\", the author concluded that she is \"fierce, honest [and] wonderful\" despite her unconventional appearance.\n\nSome critics felt Fiona's fighting prowess was otherwise undermined by her insecurities and motivations. Despite being impressed with the character's fighting ability, Furniss believes this contradicts with \"her need to seek authentication from a male romantic partner\", arguing that a true martial artist would few have concerns about outward appearance. Although acknowledging that the film demonstrates themes of inner beauty among \"women of all types\", the author argued that Fiona's understanding relies on male approval, referring to her relationships with both Farquaad and Shrek, and further observing that she struggles to use this same martial arts prowess to fend off Farquaad's guards. Furniss found it disappointing that her arc is \"activated by the kiss of a man\", but admitted the completion of Shrek's character development is similarly determined by him kissing Fiona. Furniss doubts Fiona would not have been able to accept her ogre form had Shrek decided to retreat to his swamp alone after kissing her. Author Margot Mifflin, writing for \"Salon\", felt that some of Fiona's actions contradict with the film's morals about looks being less important, citing that she dislikes Farquaad more for his short stature than his cruelty towards others. She also found the princess in Steig's original story to be more liberated and less of a damsel in distress than Fiona. Despite describing the character's ogre form as \"an overfed Cabbage Patch doll with the drowning eyes and apologetic expression of a Hummel figurine\", Mifflin found the fact that Fiona remains an ogre, fights, talks back and has more realistic body proportions to be ground-breaking, while describing her musical solo as one of the film's \"hilarious\" highlights. \"The Conversation\"'s Michelle Smith was unimpressed, writing that despite the character's fighting skills, Fiona remains \"desperate to follow the fairy tale script\" and believes marrying her rescuer is \"her ultimate reward\".\n\nFiona was celebrated as a positive role model by the Girl Scouts of the USA, who used the character's likeness in several tie-in media to promote the organization's \"Issues for Girl Scouts\" movement and encourage \"girls to develop self-confidence and embrace diversity.\" The organization also hosted a free screening of the film in 2001, which was attended by an audience of 340. For her performance in \"Shrek\", Diaz won a Kid's Choice Award for Best Burp, which the actress claims to be one of her greatest achievements. According to Daniel Kurland of Screen Rant, Diaz \"remains a crucial component of what makes the movie work\" despite resembling an \"unsung hero\" throughout the franchise. Summarizing the actress' career, Kendall Fisher of \"E! Online\" said Diaz \"voiced one of our favorite animated characters\". \"The Ringer\" ranked Shrek Diaz's best film, believing her performance as Fiona aged better than the film's soundtrack and animation. Author Alison Herman elaborated that Fiona embraced her flaws and offered children \"an important lesson in both self-esteem and the comedic value of fart jokes\", while the actress \"holds her own against\" Myers and Murphy; \"as a character, Fiona subverts the pretty-princess trope enough to provide fuel for undergrad media studies papers for decades to come\".\n\n\"Marie Claire\" ranked Fiona Diaz's third best \"Movie Moments That Made Us Fall In Love With Her\". In addition to ranking Fiona the fourth best role of Diaz's career following her retirement in 2018, Samarth Goyal of the \"Hindustan Times\" crowned Fiona \"one of the most loved animated characters of the 21st century\", crediting her with making Diaz \"a big star.\" In 2011, \"Gulf News\" ranked Diaz among \"Hollywood's A-list of most popular voice actors\", with \"Forbes\" reporting in 2010 that the actress was mentioned in the media approximately 1,809 times while promoting the most recent \"Shrek\" film. \"Teen Vogue\" considered Fiona among the \"17 Best Princesses in Movies and TV\", praising the character for learning \"to love herself.\" NBC New York's Bryan Alexander described Fiona as \"the world's hottest ogre\", while Stephen Hunter, film critic for \"The Washington Post\", found hearing Diaz's voice from a computer-animated character \"kind of hot\". To promote \"Shrek 2\", ice cream restaurant Baskin-Robbins named a flavor after the character, entitled Fiona's Fairytale. Described as \"pink and purple swirled\", the ice cream was cotton candy-flavored.\n"}

Additionally, he appeared at full level in one World Cup and one European Championship.\n\nBorn in Jerez de la Frontera, Province of Cádiz, Kiko's career began with local Cádiz CF, and he first appeared in La Liga on 14 April 1991 in a 2–3 home loss against Athletic Bilbao. Even though he played in only five further matches in the season he was intimately connected with the Andalusia club's fate as, on 9 June, in only 25 minutes of play, he gained a penalty kick and scored an 83-minute winner in a 2–1 home win over Real Zaragoza; the team would miraculously retain their status, after the playoffs against CD Málaga.\n\nAfter two more seasons as an undisputed starter Kiko moved, alongside teammate José María Quevedo to Atlético Madrid, upon Cádiz's 1993 relegation.

{"id": "2050516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050516", "title": "Samudera Pasai Sultanate", "text": "Samudera Pasai Sultanate\n\nThe Samudera Pasai Sultanate, also known as Samudera or Pasai or Samudera Darussalam or Pacem, was a Muslim harbour kingdom on the north coast of Sumatra from the 13th to the 16th centuries CE. The kingdom was believed to have been founded by Merah Silu, who later converted to Islam and adopted the name Malik ul Salih, in the year 1267 CE.\n\nLittle evidence has been left to allow for historical study of the kingdom.\n\nBased on the local literature Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai, 'Samudera' can be inferred to have come from the word \"Semudera\" (), which meant 'a very large ant'. The name was given by Merah Silu when he discovered an ant as large as a cat while hunting at a 'high ground'. Eventually, the place was cleared for the establishment of a new state and 'Semudera' was adopted as its name.\n\n'Samudera' is also theorised to have been derived from Samudra meaning ocean in Sanskrit and Tamil.\n\nThe literature also indicates the origin of the name 'Pasai' which came from \"Si-Pasai\", the hunting dog of Sultan Malik al Salleh, who was Merah Silu after his conversion to Islam. The legend narrates that Sultan Malik al Salleh, while hunting with the dog, encountered a deer which was not afraid of the dog's barking but instead barked back. He was bewildered by this and thought that this might be a good sign for the place to be established as a new state for his son Sultan Malik Al Tahir. The dog died after the state was established. Sultan Malik al Salleh buried the dog there and he eventually named the place after it.\n\nIn the 14th century, the Italian traveller Odoric of Pordenone used the name Sumoltra for Samudra, and subsequent European writers also used similar forms of the name to refer to the Sumatra island itself.\n\nPasai exported its culture, and most importantly its language — an early form of Malay written in the Jawi alphabet — to a number of islands. Later, this language became the lingua franca among traders in what is now Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nArab and Indian Muslims had traded in Indonesia and China for many centuries. A Muslim tombstone in eastern Java bears a date corresponding to 1082. But substantial evidence of Islam in Indonesia begins only in northern Sumatra at the end of the 13th century. Two small Muslim trading kingdoms existed by that time at Pasai and Peureulak or Perlak. A 1297 royal tomb at Samudra is inscribed entirely in Arabic. By the 15th century several harbour kingdoms developed, all ruled by local Muslim princes, from the north coast of Java and elsewhere to as far east as Ternate and Tidore in Maluku. Marco Polo spent five months here, he had Ferlec, Basma, and Samara (Samudera) mentioned in his travel story. Another famous traveller Ibn Battuta on his way to China stayed 15 days at Samudera.\n\nThe establishment of the first Muslim centres in Indonesia was probably a result of commercial circumstances. By the 13th century the collapse of Srivijayan power, drew foreign traders to harbours on the northern Sumatran shores of the Bay of Bengal, safe from the pirate lairs at the southern end of the Strait of Malacca. Northern Sumatra had a hinterland rich in gold and forest produce, and pepper was being cultivated at the beginning of the 15th century. It was accessible to all the merchants of the archipelago who wanted to meet ships from the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the year 1345, Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveller visited Samudra Pasai where he notes in his travel log that the ruler of Samudera Pasai was a pious Muslim, who performed his religious duties in utmost zeal. The madh'hab he observed was Imam Al-Shafi‘i. At that time Samudera Pasai was the end of Dar al-Islam for no territory east of this was ruled by a Muslim ruler. He praised the kindness and hospitality demonstrated by the sultan of Samudera Pasai. Here he stayed for about two weeks in the wooden walled town as a guest of the sultan, and then the sultan provided him with supplies and sent him on his way on one of sultan's own junks to China.\n\nBy the end of the 14th century, Samudra-Pasai had become a wealthy commercial centre, giving way in the early 15th century to the better protected harbour of Malacca on the south-west coast of the Malay Peninsula. Majapahit attacked and looted the place in the middle of the 14th century.\n\nPasai's economic and political power depended almost entirely on foreigners. Muslim traders and teachers probably participated in its administration from the beginning and were bound to introduce religious practices that made them feel at home. The first Muslim beachheads in Indonesia, especially Pasai, were to a considerable extent genuine Muslim creations that commanded the loyalty of the local population and encouraged scholarly activities. Similar new harbour kingdoms formed on the northern coast of Java. Tomé Pires, author of the \"Suma Oriental\", writing not long after 1511, stresses the obscure ethnic origins of the founders of Cirebon, Demak, Japara, and Gresik. These Javanese coastal states served commerce with India and China and especially with Malacca, an importer of Javanese rice. The rulers of Malacca, despite their prestigious Srivijayan origin, accepted Islam precisely to attract Muslim and Javanese traders to their port.\n\nThe Portuguese occupied Pasai in 1521, 10 years after their conquest of Malacca. Through the Portuguese, the place become known in Europe as Pacem. Later, the Acehnese took control of Pasai.\n\nThese are the list of rulers who ruled the Samudera Pasai Sultanate:-\nThe discovery of the tomb of Sultan Malik as-Saleh (696 H or 1267 AD), was referred to by historians as a sign that Islam had entered the Archipelago around the 13th century. Although there is an opinion that the possibility of Islam has come earlier than that. The story of the Pasai Kings is indeed full of myths and legends but the description of the story has helped in uncovering the dark side of history of the existence of this kingdom. The kingdom's past glory has inspired its people to re-use the name of the founder of this kingdom for the University of Malikussaleh in Lhokseumawe.\n\n\n"}

However, aspects of the garden's design were criticised, including its cyclone fence and lack of attention to detail.\n\nIn 1986–, Japanese landscape designer Yoshitaka Kumada drew up plans to refurbish the garden, which included the purchase of trees and shrubs from Melbourne, and stones from near Adelaide. After a Shinto ground-breaking ceremony in May 1987, the works began, with Kumada himself overseeing the project. The little lake was reshaped, the Sea of Sand was expanded, and the garden filled with carefully selected plants and ornamentation to complement the granite Okunoin lantern gifted by the City of Himeji in 1985.\n\nThe redesign was finally implemented completely in 1989, but Kumada continued to visit each year during the early 1990s, tweaking details and teaching techniques to the council gardeners.\n\nMany of Kumada's design principles are still in evidence. The paving stones are of a size that compels an adult walker to slow down. The garden is split into a \"sansui\" (山水), a \"mountain and lake garden\", and a \"kare-sansui\" (枯山水), a \"dry rock garden\", intended to evoke mountains surrounded by water, even the sea.\n\nThe Council's horticulture team still use the techniques taught by Kumada himself, handed down as staff moved on.

Lingis is also known as a photographer, and he complements the philosophical themes of many of his books with his own photography.\n\nLingis attended Loyola University in Chicago, then pursued graduate studies at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. His doctoral dissertation, written under Alphonse de Waelhens, was a discussion of the French phenomenologists Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul Sartre. Returning to the United States, Lingis joined the faculty at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. In the mid-1960s he moved to Penn State University, where he published numerous scholarly articles on the history of philosophy, developing a passionate engagement with Continental philosophy that would prove vital to his later book career. Lingis also began working at his translation projects, and over the years, translated authors included Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Pierre Klossowski.\nHis first book was \"Excesses\" (1983). Lingis followed up on this project in 1994 by publishing three books: \"The Community of Those Who Have Nothing in Common\", \"Abuses\", and \"Foreign Bodies\". In 2000, in his mid-60’s, Lingis released \"Dangerous Emotions\", which involved a series of limit-experience “dares” along with references to a broad range of philosophical topics.

In the books listed above, Lingis’s philosophical style is visceral and occasionally obscene. These books involve a jet-set Continental philosophy-referencing anthropology. Lingis’s motto from \"Abuses\" (1994) that “The unlived life is not worth examining” is categorically emphasized in these books. Lingis’s “phenomenology” monographs, on the other hand, (e.g. \"The Imperative\" (1998)) emphasize the Socratic point that “The unexamined life is not worth living.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a member of the federation of the Australian Greens party.\n\nThe party has three members in the federal and state parliaments: Sarah Hanson-Young in the Senate and Mark Parnell and Tammy Franks in the South Australian Legislative Council.\n\nPrior to 1995, a very small local Green party not connected to the emerging Australian Greens contested a number of State and Federal elections. This party was more or less non-functioning by the time Mark Parnell called the first meetings to establish a new Green Party in 1995. It took a number of attempts to get the new party off the ground, however a visit to Adelaide by Bob Brown in late 1995 provided the necessary impetus to register the new party.\n\nThe Australian Greens (SA) first ran in the 1996 federal election and the 1997 state election. In both elections they received around two percent of the statewide upper house vote.\n\nSince that time, the Greens SA have steadily built up a support base at state and federal elections, partly due to the demise of the Democrats. The Greens SA now have two MLCs and two Senators, with polling for the 2013 federal and 2014 state elections by Newspoll showing the Green vote consistently above 10 percent. The Greens SA lost their second Senate seat in the 2016 federal election, following a 1.22% decline in the Greens' Senate vote.\n\nKris Hanna, the member for Mitchell, was elected as a Labor member in 1997, but changed to The Greens in 2003. Hanna left the party in February 2006, citing constituents' wishes for him not to be bound to any party.\n\nAt the 2006 state election, Environmental lawyer Mark Parnell became the first Green candidate to be elected in South Australia, securing a position in the Legislative Council on a primary vote of 4.3 percent. A vote of 6.5 percent was achieved in the House of Assembly, an increase of 4.1%.\n\nThe best lower house result was in the electoral district of Heysen, on a primary vote of 17.7 percent. Heysen was also the Democrats closest lower house win, coming as close as 1.9 percent at the 1997 state election on a primary vote of 29.2 percent, finishing at 48.1 percent after preferences.\n\nFourth on the 2006 state ticket, Sarah Hanson-Young was first on the ticket at the 2007 federal election, and became South Australia's first Greens Senator. She won the sixth and final South Australian Senate position with a primary vote of 6.5 percent. The strongest Green votes in the Senate came from Adelaide, Boothby and Mayo.\n\nSparked by the resignation of Liberal Party MP Alexander Downer, a Mayo by-election was held in 2008. Labor chose not to contest the by-election. Greens candidate Lynton Vonow finished second, on a primary vote of 21.35 percent amongst a field of 11 candidates, a swing of 10.39 percent, and finished on a final vote of 46.97 percent after the distribution of preferences, falling narrowly short of taking the seat from the Liberals.\n\nPrior to the 2010 state election, the Greens had gone from four to ten percent and above in state Newspolls. In the lower house, the vote increased to 8.1 percent, with the upper house vote to 6.6 percent which elected Tammy Jennings (now Tammy Franks).\n\nAt the 2010 federal election, polls showed a similar substantial increase. The Greens SA received a swing of 6.8 percent in South Australia for the Australian Senate, to finish with 13.3 percent of the statewide vote. Penny Wright was subsequently elected, joining Hanson-Young and 7 other Green Senators from July 2011.\n\nHanson-Young was re-elected at the 2013 federal election with a statewide primary vote of 7.1 percent. The Greens polled strongest in the seat of Mayo with over 14 percent of the primary vote.\n\nParnell was re-elected at the 2014 election with the upper house statewide primary vote at 6.5 percent. The lower house statewide primary vote was 8.7 percent.\n\nLynton Vonow contested the seat of Heysen for the Greens and came second after preferences with a 39 percent two-candidate preferred vote from a 19.7 percent primary vote. The Greens have consistently polled strongest in Heysen but with preferences overtook the Labor candidate. The Greens also polled well in seats such as Kavel and Davenport with primary votes over 15 percent.\n\nPenny Wright resigned from the Senate due to family reasons in September 2015. Later that month, Robert Simms was appointed to the casual vacancy by a joint sitting of the Parliament of South Australia.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Turnbull announced in March 2016 that a double dissolution would be taking place in May and an election in July, the party was forced for the first time to choose between their two senators, and preselected Sarah Hanson-Young to the number 1 preference on the Senate ballot, with Robert Simms at number 2. Only Hanson-Young was reelected, being assigned a 3-year term.\n\nThe party's State Council meets once a quarter to deal with the party’s administrative matters. The party also has a Policy and Campaigning Council, which includes representatives from branches and member action groups and meets every two months to shape the party’s strategic priorities\n\nBranches are where new members first meet other Greens, talk politics and policy, get involved in local campaigning and fundraising, and find out about what else is going on.\n\nA variety of member action groups have been established by the State Council, which are directly accessible to all Greens members. Working groups perform an advisory function by developing policy, conducte issues-based campaigns, or by performing other tasks assigned by the State Council. These groups include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2050566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050566", "title": "Nuytsia", "text": "Nuytsia\n\nNuytsia is a monotypic genus of plants, of which the species Nuytsia floribunda is a hemiparasitic tree found in Western Australia. The species is known locally as moodjar and, more recently, the Christmas tree or Australian Christmas tree, as the display of intensely bright flowers during the austral summer coincides with the Christmas season.\n\nThe habit of the species is a tree up to high, or as a shrub. The rough bark is grey-brown. Flowers are a vivid yellow-orange, appearing between October and January. The inflorescence on each flowering stem may be up to one metre in length.\n\nIt is a root hemiparasite, is photosynthetic and mainly obtains water and mineral nutrients from its hosts. The haustoria arising from the roots of \"Nuytsia\" attach themselves to roots of many nearby plants and draw water and therefore nutrients from them. Almost all species are susceptible to attack; haustoria have even been found attached to underground cables. In natural settings \"Nuytsia\" withdraws relatively little from each individual host, but is attached to so many other plants that the benefit to this hemiparasitic tree is likely to be considerable.\nRoots and rhizomes extend out and may sucker to form new branches that give the appearance of a grove of trees. A network of fine and fragile roots arise from these larger underground parts, forming haustoria where they meet the roots of other species.\nThe trunk is reported as up to 1.2 metres in diameter, with multiple layers of wood and bark that allow the tree to withstand fire. An unusual characteristic of the seedlings is the four to six cotyledons rather than two.\n\nRecognised in early descriptions as a species of the family Loranthaceae, a group almost entirely represented by epiphytic mistletoes, allied to the order Santalales. The current treatment of \"Nuytsia floribunda\" is as a monotypic genus, Nuytsia. This species was seen as a sister taxon to \"Atkinsonia ligustrina\" (Loranthaceae) in the description \"Nuytsia ligustrina\" by Allan Cunningham in 1817, before its later arrangement to a separate genus, \"Atkinsonia\", which also describes a single species of Loranthaceae.\n\nThe first description of \"Nuytsia floribunda\" was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 work \"Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen\", as \"Loranthus floribundus\", the specific epithet describing the profuse flowers he would have observed at Esperance. The botanist Robert Brown published a remark on the species in 1831, giving a new genus name without a formal description. The description was published by George Don using Brown's name \"Nuytsia\", an epithet that commemorates the seventeenth-century Dutch explorer and colonial official Pieter Nuyts.\n\nThe Noongar names for the plant are moojar, moojerool, munjah and mutyal. \nThe regional name of 'Christmas tree' has been applied since the nineteenth century. James Drummond noted in 1843 that the colonists at the Swan River referred to this species as the 'fire-tree', given for the resemblance of the inflorescence to a fire in its habitat. William Milligan reported that the first colonists used the term 'cabbage tree', a reference to its fragile, white and spongey branches that can be snapped off as easily as the stalks of the European vegetable, cabbage.\n\n\"Nuytsia floribunda\" is well known in southwestern Australia, especially due to the appearance of abundant flowers in summer which is a spectacular display. Although \"Nuytsia\" seeds germinate readily and seedlings are easy to grow for a year or two, cultivation of the species to maturity is regarded as difficult, with little success outside of its native habitat. It appears on a variety of soil types throughout southwestern Australia, the distribution of the species extends to the east of the Esperance Plain and to the north on the Geraldton Sandplains. (Distribution records: The Australian Virtual Herbarium.)\n\nThe species was once common across the Swan Coastal Plain, now mostly cleared around Perth with changes in land use since colonisation.\n\nThe Nyungar people made use of the species during the season Kambarang, around October to early December, obtaining bark to make shields. The gum that exudes from the wound can be collected later, it is sweet and eaten raw. Moodjar (or Muja) is regarded as a protected tree by the Nyungar peoples of Southwest Australia, the species is noted as being incorporated into rituals and having a conservation status that forbids their destruction. The plant is venerated by some who learn that it should not be sat beneath or its flowers, leaves or branches touched or taken. The sugary gum is consumed in modest quantities, and children are warned of overindulgence with the story of a monstrous, invulnerable and inescapable nocturnal being who cry of 'Nhervalong' could be heard as it collects the gum on which it subsists. Seasonal use by other groups of the roots is also known, Ethel Hassell at Jerramungup was invited to taste some being harvested by a group of women, reporting the taste of the flesh beneath an easily removed skin as sweet, brittle and somewhat watery.\n\nThe wood of the tree was noted as commercially useless, and that cultivation and transplanting difficult or impractical for gardens or landscaping by the state's conservator Charles Lane Poole (1921), deeming the showy display of flowers to be its only desirable quality. Poole also notes the 'gum' that is exuded from the tree may be useful.\nThe artist Marianne North featured the tree in an illustration titled 'Study of the West Australian Flame-tree or\nFire-tree’ (c. 1880), now held at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and recorded her effusive impressions, \"I shall never forget one plain we came to, entirely surrounded by the nuytsia or mistletoe trees, in a full blaze of bloom. It looked like a bush-fire without smoke. The trees are, many of them, as big as average oaks in our hedgerows at home, …\" The early settler George Fletcher Moore described this parasitic tree as another \"anomaly in this land of contradictions\". \n\nA journal of systematic botany, \"Nuytsia\", published by the Western Australian Herbarium, is named for this tree.\n\nThe \"Annals of Natural History\" (1842) reported a specimen being grown at a government garden in 1841, and the attempt to raise the few seed it produced; the correspondence is printed as from \"H. Bidwell … of Sidney [sic]\".\n\nThe flowers produce large amounts of pollen and nectar that is consumed by insects.\n\nThe parasitic relationship of \"Nuytsia floribunda\" on host species was poorly understood until an investigation by the botanist D. A. Herbert was presented to the Royal Society of Western Australia, contradicting the assumption that proximity to other tree species of banksia and jarrah, \"Eucalyptus marginata\", was a requirement. Herbert discovered the extended network of filaments that embrace the roots of many other species, explaining the persistence of trees conserved in agricultural land cleared for introduced crops.\n\nThere are various lists of both native and introduced host species that are vulnerable to attack, however evidence suggests \"Nuytsia\" is capable of parasitising an extraordinarily wide range of taxa with only a single published account of a species that appeared immune. The generalised nature of the mode of host root attachment presumably allows parasitism to occur on just about anything within reach.\n\n\"Nuytsia floribunda\" was once common and well known on the coastal plain around Perth, often remaining in remnant bushland and gardens, becoming more scarce as the extent and density of urban development increased.\n\n\n\n"}

The park was opened in 1962 and named in honour of prominent South Australian politician and journalist, Sir John Langdon Bonython. It is situated on north-western side of the River Torrens, bordered by Port Road. It is on the opposite side of the river to a golf course, and adjacent to the old Adelaide Gaol and the Police Barracks.\n\nBonython Park forms part of what is known as Park 27, and since the dual naming initiative by Adelaide City Council in the early 2000s, Park 27 is also known as Tulya Wardli. There are sites straddling this park and Park 1/ Pirltawardli of some significance to the Kaurna people, since various \"native locations\" were established on the sites dating from 1837, when the first settlers arrived and the establishment of a Christian mission in the following year.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that there was a billabong on the site, used as a fishing spot for the Kaurna people prior to European settlement. Following the arrival of European settlers from 1837, right through to 1914, it was used as a watering place for cattle.\n\nThe site of Bonython Park was first area occupied by Europeans, from January to March 1837. The migrants camped in tents and wooden huts in two camps, called Buffalo and Coromandel, after two of the ships of the First Fleet of South Australia.\n\nAfter 1837, the so-called “Native Location” was established for local Kaurna people. Bromley’s Camp, the first of these, was established in April 1837 by Captain Walter Bromley, the second interim Protector of Aborigines, on land that is now part of Bonython Park. In reality it was little more than a rations distribution point. In August 1837, William Wyatt became the next Protector, and created a more permanent settlement south of the river.\n\nIn October 1838 two German missionaries, Christian Teichelmann and Clamor Schürmann (and later Samuel Klose) arrived, setting themselves up at what became known as the \"Old Location\", studying the Kaurna language and teaching in that language. This was the first mission in South Australia. In 1839 the Native Location was moved again, across to the north side of the river, on what is now part of the Par 3 golf course. This was called the Pirltawardli (now the second name for Park 1 of the Park Lands), which means \"possum place\", also known as the \"Aboriginal Location\".\n\nIn December 1840 a school opened, supported by Governor George Gawler, but the site was dismantled in 1845, on the orders of Governor George Grey, who thought it best to take the children away from their parents, and a new \"Native School\" run by the government, which taught only in English, was established near what is now Kintore Avenue. (The Native School closed in 1851, with the remaining children were taken to Poonindie Mission at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula.\n\nA few people continued to camp near the house of Klose, the only remaining missionary, at the site known as Pirltawardli. In 1846 the government build some brick sheds in part of this area, and also across the river behind the new Adelaide Gaol. One was for the \"Murray tribe\", who had moved to the area, and a smaller number of sheds for what was left of the \"Adelaide tribe\".\n\nPirltawardli, just across the river and straddling Parks 1 and 27, is still of great significance to Kaurna people, as well as non-Indigenous South Australians. Nearly all of the recorded language and early written records of Kaurna culture stem from this place, documented by the missionaries, who also shared their views on race relations in the new colony. On 26 May 2000 a plaque was erected there commemorating its place in Adelaide’s history.\n\nBonython Park, part of Park 27/Tudla Wardli, has many points of interest and recreation within and nearby.\n\nThe park hosts or has hosted a number of major events including the Schützenfest (a German shooting festival), the former Skyshow fireworks display, and various music festivals including Soundwave, Stereosonic and the Big Day Out.

Located at 1035 E. 67th Street, in the Greater Grand Crossing area of Chicago's South Side. Established on February 12, 1853, it covers .\n\nOak Woods is the final resting place of several famous Americans including Harold Washington, Ida B. Wells, Jesse Owens, and Enrico Fermi. It is also the setting for a mass grave and memorial for Confederate prisoners of war from Camp Douglas, called the Confederate Mound.\n\nOak Woods Cemetery was chartered on February 12, 1853. It was designed by landscape architect Adolph Strauch who created a ‘landscape-lawn cemetery’ on the 183 acres emphasizing grade changes with curving streets and well-planned drainage creating a uniform composition which was free of fences.\n\nThe first burials took place in 1860. After the Civil War (1861–1865), several thousand Confederate soldiers, prisoners who died at Camp Douglas, were reburied here. According to a plaque on the site, soldiers were buried in “concentric trenches.” A monument and marker, which former Kentucky Lieutenant Governor John C. Underwood helped construct, probably inflates the number of soldiers buried as 6,000, but lists the names of more than 4,000. Another, smaller memorial commemorates the Union soldiers who died at Camp Douglas, often from contagious diseases. The bodies from Camp Douglas had originally been buried at Camp Douglas and the City Cemetery, which was closed and removed during expansion of Lincoln Park and urban renewal following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. They were exhumed and reinterred together in a mass grave, which came to be known as Confederate Mound, reputedly the largest mass grave in the Western Hemisphere. In response to the establishment of the Confederate memorial, in 1896, Thomas D. Lowther, a pre-war resident of the South, erected near it an abolitionist monument. The abolition monument is a large black marble cenotaph to pre-war southerners, \"unknown heroric men\", \"martyrs\" who had \"opposed\" slavery and disunion. Near the beginning of the war, Lowther had been forced to flee his home in Florida because of his anti-slavery and pro-Union stance.\nThe Confederate memorial is No. 6 on the Make It Right Project's 2018 list of the 10 Confederate monuments it most wants removed.\n\nThe cemetery contains the graves of many prominent African Americans, including Chicago's first African-American mayor, Harold Washington. Journalist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells, Olympic sports hero Jesse Owens, and gospel music pioneer Thomas A. Dorsey are buried in the cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery is also the final resting place of 45 victims of the Iroquois Theatre fire, in which more than 600 people died.\n\nFamous nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi has his final resting place here. The cemetery also has a section for U.S. veterans of several wars, and a separately-maintained Jewish section.\n\nRoland Burris, the U.S. Senator appointed by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, constructed a family tomb at in the Oak Woods Cemetery, in preparation for his and his wife's eventual interment. The tomb recites Burris accomplishments and received considerable publicity (often negative) after Burris' appointment. \n\n\n"}

She was named after the mythological bull-headed monster of Crete. She fought in three major battles – Nile, Trafalgar, and Copenhagen (1807) – before she was wrecked, with heavy loss of life, in December 1810.\n\nOn 26 September 1795 \"Minotaur\" and recaptured \"Packet\". The French corvette brig \"Insolent\", of 18 guns and 90 men, had captured \"Walsingham Packet\", which was sailing from Falmouth to Lisbon, on 13 September. \"Insolent\" narrowly escaped being herself captured at the recapture of \"Walsingham Packet\", getting into Lorient as the British ships came into range.\n\n\"Minotaur\" fought at the battle of the Nile in 1798, engaging the \"Aquilon\" with HMS \"Theseus\" and forcing her surrender. In the battle \"Minotaur\" lost 23 men dead and 64 wounded.\n\nAfter the French surrendered Rome on 29 September 1799, Captain Thomas Louis had his barge crew row him up the Tiber River where he raised the Union Jack over the Capitol.\n\nIn May 1800, \"Minotaur\" served as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Keith at the siege of Genoa. On 28 April, the squadron captured the \"Proteus\", off Genoa.\n\nOn 8 January 1801 captured the French bombard \"St. Roche\", which was carrying wine, liqueurs, ironware, Delfth cloth, and various other merchandise, from Marseilles to Alexandria. , \"Tigre\", \"Minotaur\", , , and the schooner \"Malta\", were in sight and shared in the proceeds of the capture.\n\nShe was present at the landings in Aboukir Bay during the invasion of Egypt in 1801 where she lost a total of three men killed, and six wounded. Because \"Minotaur\" served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \"Egypt\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 to all surviving claimants.\n\nOn 28 May 1803 \"Minotaur\", in company with , and later joined by , captured the French frigate \"Franchise\". \"Franchise\" was 33 days out of Port-au-Prince, and was pierced for twenty-eight 12-pounder guns on her main deck and sixteen 9-pounders on her quarterdeck and forecastle, ten of which were in her hold. She had a crew of 187 men under the command of Captain Jurien.\n\n\"Minotaur\" was present at the surrender of the French garrison at Civitavecchia on 21 September 1804. She shared the prize money for the capture of the town and fortress with , , \"Transfer\", and the bomb vessel . The British also captured the French polacca \"Il Reconniscento\".\n\n\"Minotaur\", under Captain Charles John Moore Mansfield, participated in the Battle of Trafalgar. There she was instrumental in capturing the Spanish ship \"Neptuno\", although \"Neptuno\"s crew recaptured her in the storm that followed the battle.\n\n\"Minotaur\" was towards the rear of Nelson's wing of his fleet at Trafalgar. Mansfield pledged to his assembled crew that he would stick to any ship he engaged \"till either she strikes or sinks – or I sink\". Late in the battle he deliberately placed \"Minotaur\" between the damaged \"Victory\" and an attacking French ship; he was later awarded a sword and gold medal for his gallantry. Both are now in the National Maritime Museum.\n\nIn 1807 \"Minotaur\" served as the flagship of Rear-Admiral William Essington at the battle of Copenhagen.\n\nThen on 25 July, during the Anglo-Russian War, 17 boats from a British squadron under the command of Captain Charles Pater, consisting of \"Minotaur\", , and , attacked a flotilla of four Russian gunboats and a brig off Aspö Head near Fredrickshamn in the Grand Duchy of Finland, Russia (present-day Hamina, Finland). Captain Forrest of \"Prometheus\" commanded the boats and succeeded in capturing gunboats Nos. 62, 65, and 66, and the transport brig No. 11. The action was sanguinary in that the British lost 19 men killed and 51 wounded, and the Russians lost 28 men killed and 59 wounded. \"Minotaur\" alone lost eight men killed and had 30 wounded, of whom four died of their wounds on the next day or so. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"25 July Boat Service 1809\" to surviving claimants from the action. \"Cerberus\" then moved to the Mediterranean in 1810.\n\nWhilst sailing from Gothenburg to Britain, under the command of John Barrett, \"Minotaur\" in darkness and heavy weather struck the Haak Bank, or \"Razende Bol\", on the Texel off the Netherlands, then part of the First French Empire, in the evening of 22 December 1810, after becoming separated from her consorts, HMS and \"Loire\". \"Minotaur\" got stuck in the sand, rolled on her side and quickly made water. It was decided to cut all the masts to lighten the ship; this destroyed some of the boats. By the early morning, the ship had nevertheless sunk deeper, flooding the forecastle. Waves pounded the hull. Around 08:00, the hull split asunder. The crew, taking refuge on the poop deck, tried to evacuate on a remaining launch and two yauls. Thirty-two men escaped on a yaul. When they reached the Dutch coast, this inspired another eighty-five to use the launch; they too reached the shore. Captain Barrett, together with about a hundred men, then tried to escape with the remaining yaul but it was swamped and all drowned. Around 14:00, the \"Minotaur\" turned completely, drowning the remaining crew. The 110 of her crew that had taken to her boats informed the Dutch authorities of the disaster. Another twenty survivors were rescued by a pilot vessel. The authorities placed the survivors under custody and refused to dispatch more rescue vessels until the following morning. The rescue party found however that apart from four men who had reached shore by clinging to wreckage, no survivors remained on the vessel or in the surrounding water. The death toll therefore was between 370 and 570 men. All survivors were taken to France as prisoners of war.\n\nThree and a half years later, when the prisoners were released, the customary court martial decided that the deceased pilots were to blame for steering the ship into an unsafe position, having misjudged their location by over 60 miles because of the weather. Some of the survivors, including Lieutenant Snell, criticized the Dutch authorities for their failure to despatch rescue boats sooner. Snell stated \"The launch which had brought on shore eighty-five men, was of the smallest description of 74 launches, with one gunwale entirely broken in, and without a rudder. This will better prove than anything I can say how easy it would have been for the Dutch admiral in the Texel to have saved, or to have shown some wish to have saved, the remaining part of the crew\". Reports from the Dutch chief officer of the marine district of the North coast indicated that the Dutch had sent two boats out to examine the wreck site on the morning of 23 December, but the wind and the seas prevented them from approaching. Maritime historian William Stephen Gilly concluded in 1850 that \"There is not the slightest doubt but that, had the Dutch sent assistance, the greater part of the ship's company would have been saved\".\n\nThe famed landscape painter J. M. W. Turner depicted the sinking, though the subject was not originally the \"Minotaur\", but a generic merchant ship. Turner had been producing sketches in preparation for the painting as early as 1805, but by the time he had completed the painting in 1810, the recent wreck of \"Minotaur\" was a subject of much discussion. He named the painting to capitalise on this public interest.\n\nThe shipwreck of \"Minotaur\" remains the largest ever, in terms of loss of life, on the Dutch coast, with the possible exception of the loss of on 24/25 December 1811, on the same location. The tragic event, and the British accusations, made the Dutch realise that, despite the notoriously dangerous shoals in their waters, they lacked specialised equipment to save the crews of wrecked ships. In response on 11 November 1824, for the area of the Texel the \"Koninklijke Noord-Hollandsche Redding-Maatschappij\" was founded, the first Dutch sea-rescue organisation.\n\nMaster's mate Stephen Hilton brought home the Union Jack from \"Minotaur\" at Trafalgar as a souvenir, along with an Austrian flag from a captured Spanish ship. His descendants presented the flags to St Mary's Church in Kent in 1930, where they hung until 2011 when the church sold them to the National Maritime Museum for a reported sum of £175,000. After conservation work the flag was put on display in October 2015 in the National Maritime Museum to mark Trafalgar Day. It has lost its right-hand edge, and an oblong section that may have been cut away as a souvenir, but was in surprisingly good condition. After cleaning and gently ironing out 200 years’ worth of creases and crumples it gained several centimetres, and now measures an imposing 233 x 310 cm.\n\nNotes;\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n"}
{"id": "2050611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050611", "title": "AnoNet", "text": "AnoNet\n\nanoNet is a decentralized friend-to-friend network built using VPNs and software BGP routers. anoNet works by making it difficult to learn the identities of others on the network allowing them to anonymously host IPv4 and IPv6 services.\n\nImplementing an anonymous network on a service by service basis has its drawbacks, and it is debatable if such work should be built at the application level. A simpler approach could be to design an IPv4/IPv6 network where its participants enjoyed strong anonymity. Doing so allows the use of any number of applications and services already written and available on the internet at large.\n\nIPv4 networks do not preclude anonymity by design; it is only necessary to decouple the identity of the owner of an IP address from the address itself. Commercial internet connectivity and its need of billing records makes this impossible, but private IPv4 networks do not share that requirement. Assuming that a router administrator on such a metanet knows only information about the adjacent routers, standard routing protocols can take care of finding the proper path for a packet to take to reach its destination. All destinations further than one hop can for most people's threat models be considered anonymous. This is because only your immediate peers know your IP. Anyone not directly connected to you only knows you by an IP in the 21.0.0.0/8 range, and that IP is not necessarily tied to any identifiable information.\n\nEveryone can build a profile of an anoNet IP address: what kind of documents it publishes or requests, in which language, about which countries or towns, etc. If this IP ever publishes a document that can lead to its owner's identity, then all other documents ever published or requested can be tied to this identity. Unlike some other Friend to Friend (F2F) programs, there is no automatic forwarding in anoNet that hides the IP of a node from all nodes that are not directly connected to it.\n\nHowever, all existing F2F programs can be used inside anoNet, making it harder to detect that someone uses one of these F2F programs (only a VPN connection can be seen from the outside, but traffic analysis remain possible).\n\nSince running fiber to distant hosts is prohibitively costly for the volunteer nature of such a network, the network uses off-the-shelf VPN software for both router to router, and router to user links. This offers other advantages as well, such as invulnerability to external eavesdropping and the lack of need for unusual software which might give notice to those interested in who is participating.\n\nTo avoid addressing conflict with the internet itself, anoNet initially used the IP range 1.0.0.0/8. This was to avoid conflicting with internal networks such as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16, as well as assigned Internet ranges. In January 2010 IANA allocated 1.0.0.0/8 to APNIC. In March 2017 anoNet changed the network to use the 21.0.0.0/8 subnetwork, which is assigned to the United States Department of Defense but is not currently in use on the internet.\n\nThe network itself is not arranged in any regular, repeating pattern of routers, although redundant (>1) links are desired. This serves to make it more decentralized, reduces choke points, and the use of BGP allows for redundancy.\n\nSuitable VPN choices are available, if not numerous. Any robust IPsec package is acceptable, such as FreeS/WAN or Greenbow. Non-IPsec solutions also exist, such as OpenVPN and SSH tunneling. There is no requirement for a homogeneous network; each link could in fact use a different VPN daemon.\n\nOne of the primary goals of anoNet is to protect its participants' rights of speech and expression, especially those that have come under attack of late. Some examples of what might be protected by anoNet include:\n\n\nIt is impossible on the Internet to communicate with another host without knowing its IP address. Thus, the anoNet realizes that you will be known to your peer, along with the subnet mask used for communicating with them. A routing protocol, BGP, allows any node to advertise any routes they like, and this seemingly chaotic method is what provides users with anonymity. Once a node advertises a new route, it is hard for anyone else to determine if it is a route to another machine in another country via VPN, or just a dummy interface on that users machine.\n\nIt is possible that certain analysis could be used to determine if the subnet was remote (as in another country), or local (as in either a dummy interface, or a machine connected via Ethernet.)\nThese include TCP timestamps, ping times, OS identification, user agents, and traffic analysis.\nMost of these are mitigatible through action on the users' part.\n\nThere are 65536 ASNs available in BGP v4. Long before anoNet reaches that number of routers the network will have to be split into OSPF clouds, or switched to a completely different routing protocol or alter the BGP protocol to use a 32bit integer for ASNs, like the rest of the Internet will do, since 32-bit AS numbers now are standardised.\n\nThere are also only 65536 /24 subnets in the 21.0.0.0/8 subnet. This would be easier to overcome by adding a new unused /8 subnet if there were any.\n\nBelow is the list of allocated IPv4 and IPv6 subnets as of 4 March 2020.\n\nSince there is no identifiable information tied to a user of anoNet, one might assume that the network would drop into complete chaos. Unlike other anonymous networks, on anoNet if a particular router or user is causing a problem it is easy to block them with a firewall. In the event that they are affecting the entire network, their peers would drop their tunnel.\n\nWith the chaotic nature of random addressing, it is not necessary to hide link IP addresses. These are already known. If however, a user wants to run services, or participate in discussions anonymously, he can advertise a new route, and bind his services or clients to the new IP addresses.\n\nSimilar software :\n\nConsideration of User Preference on Internet-based Overlay Network, T Gu, JB Yoo, CY Park - …, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing, 2008 …, 2008 - ieeexplore.ieee.org\n"}

On June 15, 1949, the enactment of \"Republic Act 391\" separated Malay from Buruanga to become an independent municipality.\n\nIt was hit severely by typhoon Seniang on 9–10 December 2006, with much destruction and damage of homes and infrastructure.\n\nBuruanga is located at the western tip of Panay Island. It is a coastal town bounded on the north by Malay; south by Libertad, Antique; and west by the Cuyo East Pass of the Sulu Sea. It is from the provincial capital Kalibo.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aklan.\n\nThere is one prevailing type of climate identified as Type I, two pronounced seasons which are dry from November to April and wet for the rest of the year. This is also true in all municipalities of Western Aklan such as Malay (excluding Boracay Island) and Nabas, as well as the Western portion of the municipalities bounding Antique.\n\nIn these areas, including Buruanga, the wettest month is August with rainfall averaging and the driest is March with rainfall of only about . The average temperature if the area is with an average humidity of 77.8%. The wet season coincides with the planting of rice while offshore fishing is in full gear during the dry season. Typhoons and strong winds rarely occur, and if it ever occurs, it coincides with the wet season. The humid north-western monsoon arrives in the area by June causing an increase in rainfall which reaches its peak in the month of August.\n\nBuruanga is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\nIn the , Buruanga had a population of . The population density was .\n\nDespite its proximity to Boracay, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Philippines, Buruanga sees very few tourists. Various scenic spots such as caves, waterfalls, beaches, hills, and mountain parks are found throughout the area such as the Hinugtan White Beach, Batason (Ariel’s) Point, Langka Beach, Nasog Beach, Tuburan Baybay Beach, Tigis Beach/Falls, and Pagatpat Mangrove Park.\n\nThe upland barangay of Tag-Osip contains a portion of the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park which is contained within the municipalities of Buruanga, Malay, and Nabas in Aklan Province and Libertad and Pandan in Antique. The park is home to many important plant and animal species such as the Visayan leopard cat, the blue-necked parrot, the Visayan hornbill, and the roughneck monitor lizard.\n\nIn 2011, several researchers from the United States Peace Corps conducted various biological assessments along the Buruanga coastline. It was found that Buruanga hosts 4 different species of mangroves including large tracts of nypa found in the barangays of Alegria, Balusbos, Poblacion, and Santander. Other species including pagatpat, bakawan, and piyapi are concentrated in Pagatpat Mangrove Park in barangay Panilongan with a few trees in spotted areas in barangay Santander. Buruanga also is home to 5 different species of seagrass identified including \"Cymodocea rotundata\", \"Cymodocea serrulata\", \"Halodule pinifolia\", \"Halophila ovalis\" and \"Thalassia hemprichii\".\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIbajay is the birthplace of Col. Alejandro S. Melchor, whose design of the pontoon bridge contributed to the Allied Forces winning World War II.\n\nThe autonomous barangays that the Spaniards encountered in Cebu could barely provide them with food enough for their needs. Miguel López de Legazpi had to move his camp sailing from Cebu to Panay Island in 1569.\n\nDesiring to explore the island for food and spice, Legazpi ordered some of his men to move further on the Island until they run out of bread to eat. Tired and hungry, the Spaniards solicited something to eat from the natives. To their surprise, they were given a container full of brown rice. When the Spaniards asked the natives what kind of rice they gave, they politely replied, “ba-hay,” meaning, a third class rice. In recognition of the generosity of the natives, they named the place, “Panay y bahay” – the place in Panay where there was and the Spaniards were given “ba-hay” rice.\n\nThe word Ibajay was originally written with the capital letter Y. It was only in 1902 when an American supervising teacher made the change of Ybajay to Ibajay because of the preference to the English alphabet and the difficulty of the Americans in spelling the word.\n\nThe first seat of government by the Spanish authorities was in Boboc-on, Barangay Naile in the 17th century. The system of government that the Spaniards established was the encomienda. They rule the natives by control from a royal grant from the King of Spain. The King of Spain appointed an encomiendero as the overseer with the Governadorcillo, Cabeza Mayores and Cabezas de Barangay as subordinates.\n\nIn the early part of the Spanish dominion, the barangay was made the basic structure of government in Ibajay. The Chieftain collected tributes from his sinakupan (people) and turn over the collections to the encomienderos. Later on, however, the barangay government was reorganized again into sakups. With each has to elect a governadorcillo. The governadorcillo was elected by the votes of selected married male natives called principales. The candidate has to be recommended and nominated by the community, or by the encomiendero.\n\nBut to the eyes of the natives, the village chief was just an administrative leader. He was not an absolute ruler like the Spaniards imposed. A traditional body of customs and procedures limited the scope of his authority. Although his position had become hereditary, it was originally attained by an exhibition of greater prowess and valor, traits useful for the community’s survival.\n\nDismayed by the exploitative nature of the government system and their unwillingness to accept the Spanish sovereignty, Chieftains Hangoe, Sandok and Kabatak fled to the vast mountains of Panay. Still, the Spanish continued their colonization. The natives could not do anything but accept the dictum of the Spaniards to survive and go on with their lives.\n\nThe first native to hold public office in Sitio Boboc-on as governadorcillo was Don Francisco Dalisay who was elected by the principales in 1673. However, Muslim pirates and bandits from Mindanao often pestered the town. Hence, in 1786, Governadorcillo Juan Sabino moved the seat of government to Sitio Maganhup, a wide land between now Barangay Naile and Barangay San Jose. The new site however, did not prove to be safe from the continued beleaguering of the lawless elements. Furthermore, it was not an ideal, area for the natives because it was far from the farms they cultivate.\n\nConsequently, for the second time in 1792, Governador Jose Garcia transferred the seat of government to Sitio Adiango, now part of Barangay Laguinbanua. However, it only stayed there for 11 years. Capitan Josef Flores moved again the seat of government to its present location. By the decree issued by the Governador of the Philippine Islands, watchtowers were fortified along the shorelines to give warning and protection against bandits and crooks. A church was also erected.\n\nThe Philippine Revolution broke out in the later part of the 19th century. The Tagalog Insurrectos under the leadership of Gen. Ananias Diokno defeated and drove away the Spaniards who were hiding behind the buttress of the Catholic Convent in Poblacion.\n\nThe Philippine flag was hoisted at the town square for the first time. In the year 1879, Don Ciriaco Tirol y Seneres was appointed as acting Capitan Municipal until 1898. The following year, under the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, Don Antonio Manikan was elected Capitan Municipal. The position he held until 1901.\n\nIn 1902, The Americans reorganized the local government of Ibajay. They changed the designation of the head of the town from Capitan Municipal to Municipal President. It was also during this year that the official name of the town was changed from Ybajay to Ibajay.\n\nThe first Municipal President elected was Don Valintin Conanan. During his term, a cholera epidemic broke out in the Municipality of Ibajay. It snapped out so many lives. As a contingency, a new cemetery was opened near the Catholic Cemetery. It is now known as the Ibajay Municipal Cemetery.\n\nIn the year 1921, Catalino Solidum was appointed Municipal President. He held the position for only a year. Moises T. Solidum replaced him the following year until the year 1925. Tomas Bautista became the mayor of Ibajay from 1926 to 1928, while Jose S. Conanan from 1937 to 1940.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. Jose C. Miraflores became the mayor until the outbreak of World War II. Ibajay, that time, was razed to the ground by the Japanese troops. Many Ibayhanons suffered the painful consequences of the war. Also that time, Guerilla Liberation Movement helped to the Philippine forces became popular among the locals. Ibayhanon women formed the Ibajay Ladies Auxialliary War Relief Association (LAWRA) to raise funds and morale of the Revolutionary Army. In 1944 to 1945, started the liberation, many Filipino troops of the 6th, 61st and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 6th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated the town of Ibajay, Aklan and helping Ibayhanon guerrilla groups and defeating Japanese troops at the end of World War II. Moreover, the local civil government was established with Guillermo de los Reyes as acting Municipal Mayor Moises T. Solidum later on replaced him until 1946.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aklan.\n\nIbajay lies in the north-west section of Aklan province on Panay Island. It is bounded on the north by the Sibuyan Sea; east by Tangalan; west by Nabas and south by Antique.\n\nThe distance from Kalibo, the capital of Aklan, is , and takes about 45 minutes to one hour by road transport. Its road networks are composed of of National Road, of Provincial Roads, and of Barangay Road.\n\nIbajay is politically subdivided into 35 barangays.\n\nIn the , Ibajay had a population of . The population density was .\n\nIbajay had a total population of 39,643 in the May 2000 census, with a calculated growth rate of 0.03%. The total number of households is 7,918 with an average household size of 5. At the 2010 census, the population had increased to 45,279 persons, a 14.2% increase since 2000.\n\nIbajay is classified as a third municipality (based on income). Rice farming is the major source of income. Coconut produce plays a major article for export and processing. There are 12 stationary rice mills and 21 roving rice mills for the post harvest needs of the farmers. There are 25 registered cooperatives and most of them are the Farmer’s Multipurpose Cooperatives. Vegetable and livestock production are on a backyard scale. Fishing and fishpond production are done along the near coastal barangays. The center for business and trade is the Ibajay Public Market at the Poblacion. There are three barangay markets located at Barangay Naile, Maloco and San Jose.\n\nThe Ibajay Rural Bank, Inc. provides financial assistance to local traders and business entrepreneurs.\n\nBranches of well-known local and international brands are now located in Ibajay such as Jollibee (TBC), Goldilocks Bakeshop, Dunkin Donuts, Bread & Butter Bakeshop, 7-Eleven, Mercury Drug and Andok's.\n\nMayors and their dates of office:\n\nCommunication and Postal Service are available through the Philippine Postal Corporation, Inc. and the Bureau of Telecommunications. A PLDT, CRUZTELCO and PANTELCO Public Calling Office provide long distance and domestic telecommunication needs of the Ibayhanons. The Aklan Cable TV and Kalibo Cable TV provide the cable television services of the town.\n\nThe electricity is provided by the Aklan Electric Cooperative, which serves about 3,862 households. Barangay Malindog purchased its own generator to provide alternative power to its residents. Barangay Aparicio and Mina-a completed the Micro-Hydro Power Plant projects and are now operational to provide electricity to the residents.\n\nHealth services are provided by the Ibajay District Hospital and 11 Barangay Health Stations.\n\nThere are 17 Elementary Schools, 14 Primary Schools, 5 National High Schools and Aklan State University (ASU) – Ibajay Campus for tertiary education.\n\nThere are also two (2) private secondary schools. One is Ibajay Academy founded by Procopio Solidum who was hailed as the \"First Filipino poet to publish poems in English\" or \"First Filipino-English Poet.\" The other one is Melchor Memorial School, founded by Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon, in honor of the late Col. Alejandro S. Melchor, Sr.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2050632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050632", "title": "Waste (law)", "text": "Waste (law)\n\nWaste is a term used in the law of real property to describe a cause of action that can be brought in court to address a change in condition of real property brought about by a current tenant that damages or destroys the value of that property. A lawsuit for waste can be brought against a life tenant or lessee of a leasehold estate, either by a current landlord or by the owner of a vested future interest. The holder of an executory interest, however, has no standing to enforce an action for waste, since his future interest is not vested. There are several different kinds of waste under the law.\n\nVoluntary waste, (sometimes called \"affirmative waste\") is any change made to the estate that intentionally or negligently causes harm to the estate or depletes its resources, unless this depletion is a continuation of a pre-existing use. Some jurisdictions follow what is called the open mines doctrine, which permits continued excavation from any mine on the property that is already open, but prohibits the opening of new mines. However, the majority of jurisdictions now follow a doctrine that allows \"any\" activity necessary to continue the exploitation of a particular resource, if the land has already been used for that purpose.\n\nPermissive waste is failure to maintain the estate, either physically or financially. Rather than requiring some bad act on the part of the tenant, this requires the failure to maintain ordinary repairs, pay taxes, or pay interest on the mortgage by the life tenant or the lessee of a leasehold estate.\n\nAmeliorative waste is an improvement to an estate that changes its character even if the change increases the land's value. Under English common law, when ameliorative waste occurs, the interested party can recover from the tenant the cost of restoring the land to its original condition. This is based on traditional common law jurisprudence presuming that the grantor intended the property to be kept in its original condition.\n\nPerson A has a present life estate to three acres of land with a beautiful forest and his family's historic home. Person B is willed to inherit the estate after A dies. B loves studying ancestry and hopes to one day live in the historic building on his family's land. Instead, A decides that the land would be more valuable as a nightclub and draws up a business plan to transform the old estate into a new late night hotspot. B can sue A for ameliorative waste and get an injunction preventing the construction of the club. Even if the club is set to make money and the old family house is a valueless wreck in terrible condition, B still has a right to stop A from improving the property.\n\nIf A does in fact build the club, then B can sue for the cost of demolishing the new structure and returning the land to its original condition.\n\nIn the United States, damages for ameliorative waste are generally not given, especially if the improvement to the property is likely to last a long time. The policy behind this change in common law is to encourage improvements and economic development, even at the cost of historical change.\n\nThere is an exception to this doctrine where a long-term tenant makes a change that increases the value of the property in a way that reflects a change in the nature and character of neighboring properties. If a tenant tears down a house and builds a factory on property in an area in which residences have generally been replaced with industry, the tenant will not be liable for waste.\n\nIn \"Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co.\", 79 N.W. 738 (Wis. 1899), the Pabst Brewing Company's plant encroached on a residential home. The owner of the home wanted to convert the land to commercial use but held an estate limiting the land to residential purposes. The court held that the neighboring properties had sufficiently changed the nature of the area and allowed the estate holder to convert the land despite the existence of potential ameliorative waste.\n\nUnder English law and Australian law, equitable waste is waste that a life tenant has a right to commit at common law but is restrained by a court of equity. This doctrine fits under the broader framework of equity, in which a legal right to do something is not so unrestrained that it is impossible to abuse that right. A life tenant who is granted an estate \"without impeachment of waste\" (may not be sued for waste) may not commit acts of flagrant destruction inconsistent with the fruitful use of the land. For example, a mansion may not be stripped of its glass, timber or pipes (\"Vane v Lord barnard\"), nor may trees of an ornamental value be cut down by the life tenant (\"Turner v Wright\").\n\nWhere a court finds that a tenant is engaging in waste, there are a number of possible remedies which can be taken:\n\nKentucky has a particularly harsh remedy for voluntary waste. A person found to have committed voluntary waste without the written permission of the holder of the future interest is forced to pay treble damages to the holder of the future interest, and the person's present interest (whether a life estate or a lease) is automatically terminated.\n\nMissouri has two statutes that prescribe a harsh remedy for waste. There, a person found to have committed voluntary waste without the written permission of the holder of the future interest is forced to pay treble damages. In some cases, the plaintiff has been able to recover treble damages twice--once for voluntary waste and again for wantonly committed waste.\n\nIf the plaintiff can show that the defendant is currently engaged in voluntary or permissive waste of the land, the court may enjoin (or stop) the activity; however, courts are reluctant to enjoin ameliorative waste unless the property being destroyed has some unique historic value.\n\n"}

It is synthesized primarily as a 155 amino acid polypeptide, resulting in an 18 kDa protein. However, there are four alternate start codons which provide N-terminal extensions of 41, 46, 55, or 133 amino acids, resulting in proteins of 22 kDa (196 aa total), 22.5 kDa (201 aa total), 24 kDa (210 aa total) and 34 kDa (288 aa total), respectively. Generally, the 155 aa/18 kDa low molecular weight (LMW) form is considered cytoplasmic and can be secreted from the cell, whereas the high molecular weight (HMW) forms are directed to the cell's nucleus. \n\nFibroblast growth factor protein was first purified in 1975, but soon afterwards others using different conditions isolated basic FGF, Heparin-binding growth factor-2, and Endothelial cell growth factor-2. Gene sequencing revealed that this group was in fact the same FGF2 protein and that it was a member of a family of FGF proteins. FGF2 binds to and exerts effects via specific fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins which themselves constitute a family of closely related molecules.\n\nLike other FGF family members, basic fibroblast growth factor possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. \n\nIn normal tissue, bFGF is present in basement membranes and in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of blood vessels. It stays membrane-bound as long as there is no signal peptide.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that, during both wound healing of normal tissues and tumor development, the action of heparan sulfate-degrading enzymes activates bFGF, thus mediating the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis.\n\nIn addition, it is synthesized and secreted by human adipocytes and the concentration of FGF2 correlates with the BMI in blood samples. It was also shown to act on preosteoblasts – in the form of an increased proliferation – after binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase.\n\nFGF2 has been shown in preliminary animal studies to protect the heart from injury associated with a heart attack, reducing tissue death and promoting improved function after reperfusion.\n\nRecent evidence has shown that low levels of FGF2 play a key role in the incidence of excessive anxiety.\n\nAdditionally, FGF2 is a critical component of human embryonic stem cell culture medium; the growth factor is necessary for the cells to remain in an undifferentiated state, although the mechanisms by which it does this are poorly defined. It has been demonstrated to induce gremlin expression which in turn is known to inhibit the induction of differentiation by bone morphogenetic proteins. It is necessary in mouse-feeder cell dependent culture systems, as well as in feeder and serum-free culture systems. FGF2, in conjunction with BMP4, promote differentiation of stem cells to mesodermal lineages. After differentiation, BMP4 and FGF2 treated cells generally produce higher amounts of osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation than untreated stem cells. However, a low concentration of bFGF (10 ng/mL) may exert an inhibitory effect on osteoblast differentiation.\n\nBasic fibroblast growth factor has been shown to interact with casein kinase 2, alpha 1, RPL6 and ribosomal protein S19.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050646", "title": "Vestfold Line", "text": "Vestfold Line\n\nThe Vestfold Line () is a railway line which runs between Drammen and Eidanger in Norway. The line connects to the Drammen Line at the northern terminus at Drammen Station and continues as the Bratsberg Line past Skien Station. The line is exclusively used for passenger trains, which are provided by the Norwegian State Railways, which connect northwards to Oslo and south-westwards to Grenland. The section from Eidanger to Skien is often colloquially included in the Vestfold Line.The standard gauge line is electrified at and has twelve remaining stations. The Vestfold Line runs through the coastal region of Vestfold and serves major towns including Holmestrand, Tønsberg, Sandefjord and Larvik, as well as Sandefjord Airport, Torp.\n\nThe section to Larvik Station was opened on 13 October 1881 and the remainder, including an extension to Skien Station, opened on 23 November 1882. The line was originally variously known as the Drammen–Skien Line (), the County Line () and the Jarlsberg Line (), until it became known as the Vestfold Line. Horten was served via the now closed Horten Line from Skoppum Station. Three other branches were later built: the Brevik Line (1895), the Tønsberg–Eidsfoss Line (1901) and the Holmestrand–Vittingfoss Line (1902). The latter two were private and closed in 1938. The Vestfold Line received gauge conversion from the original narrow gauge in 1949, as the last mainline railway in Norway. It was electrified in 1957.\n\nSince the 1980s there have been plans to upgrade the line to high speed. The first section, at Skoger, opened in 1995. It was followed by a section past Sande Station in 2001, a passing loop at Nykirke in 2002 and a section including the Jarlsberg Tunnel in Tønsberg in 2011. In 2016 a new railway through Holmestrand, of which most is in the Holmestrandsporten tunnel, opened. In september 2018 a new double track line between Larvik and Porsgrunn opened, which shortened the travel-time from 33 to 12 minutes.\n\nThe Vestfold Line runs from Drammen Station to Eidanger Station, through three counties, Buskerud, Vestfold and Telemark, and nine municipalities, Drammen, Sande, Holmestrand, Re, Horten, Tønsberg, Stokke, Larvik and Porsgrunn. The line is , of which is double track. The entire line is electrified, has partial automatic train control and GSM-R. It has 111 level crossings, of which 29 have light and bar. The railway line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration.\n\nRevenue traffic on the line is nearly exclusively provided by the Norwegian State Railways as a regional service, numbered R11. These continue southwards along the Bratsberg Line to Grenland towns of Porsgrunn and Skien and northwards along the Drammen and Asker Line to Oslo and onwards via the Gardermoen Line to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and the Dovre Line to Lillehammer. Trains operate with a fixed hourly service, with additional trains during rush-hour.\n\nVy uses Class 70 and 74 electric multiple units on the line. Vy freighted 1.7 million passengers on the line in 2012, making it the busiest regional rail service provided by Vy. Vy provides an included shuttle service from Sandefjord Airport Station to Sandefjord Airport, Torp, which takes four minutes. The Vestfold Line is occasionally used by rerouted freight trains along the Sørlandet Line when that line is closed between Drammen and Nordagutu.\n\nPublic opinion started debating the need for a railway through Vestfold in the late 1860s, when the Randsfjorden Line was built to Drammen, opening in 1968. The parliamentarians from Jarlsberg and Larvik County (renamed Vestfold in 1919) appealed to the government in 1869 for the construction of a railway through Vestfold south from Drammen to Larvik and onwards to Langefjorden. The request was positively accepted by the government, who instructed the railway director to carry out surveys through Vestfold, prioritizing it higher than the surveys through Østfold.\n\nThe country experienced an economic boom starting in 1871, with demands throughout the country for railways to be built. Official planning of a railway through Vestfold to Brevik commenced with a royal resolution on 24 July 1871. In addition to providing a regional rail service to Vestfold, a steamship service could be set up from Larvik to Frederikshavn, Denmark. There was also at the time problems with the inner parts of the Oslofjord and the Drammensfjord icing during winter, and access to the ports on the outer fjord would ease the export situation for industry.\n\nThere were a multitude of proposals for where the railway should run. The only points of agreement were that the line should run through Tønsberg, Sandefjord and Larvik, and the line between the three towns was the least controversial. North of Tønsberg there was more disunity. One proposal was to run the railway from Vestfossen Station on the Kongsberg Line along the east shore of Eikeren and down to Tønsberg along a route similar to that which the Tønsberg–Eidsfoss Line would later follow. A branch line would then be built to Horten. This alternative allowed the line to run through an area with good access to lumber, which the railway would aid export. The main disadvantage was that the route was longer than via Sande.\n\nAlternatively a passage through Sande was proposed, although fourteen different routes were proposed. Three main ones were the inner, outer and combined coastal alternatives. The outer followed the shore of the Oslofjord, would be and would run through Holmestrand, Horten and Åsgårdstrand before reaching Tønsberg. The combined and inner would be , respectively, and both involved building a branch line to Horten. A major argument against the coastal route was that the towns already had a good steamship service, with services several daily departures. A third major alternative was to bypass the coast altogether and build a connection from the Kongsberg Line at Skollenborg Station down the valley of Lågendalen to Larvik. The main advantage of this alternative was the large potential for hydroelectricity along Numedalslågen.\nJarlsberg and Larvik County Council and the town councils appointed a railway committee, which asked the county governor on 27 November 1873 to issue shares in the new railway. The county bought shares worth 400,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Shares for a coastal railway were bought for NOK 4.9 million, twice that of the interior route. The coastal route was expected to pay a dividend of three to four percent, compared to two and a half percent for the interior. Ahead of the county council meeting in December 1873 the county governor recommended that an application be sent to the government without a preferred route, but the majority of the county council's members voted in favor the interior alternative.\n\nAt the time the railway was variously referred to as the County Line and the Jarlsberg Line, both named for the historic countship of Jarlsberg. By 1874 the state railway commission had considered the line and had concluded that it should be built with narrow gauge. Only its chair, Professor Broch, voted in favor of standard gauge, and at the same time recommended that the Drammen Line be converted to the wider gauge. The advantage of narrow gauge was that it would cut construction costs by a third. By then the railway director, Carl Abraham Pihl, had concluded in disfavor of the Vestfold Line and had instead wanted to prioritize the Østfold Line. His view was shared by the cabinet. The break-through came when plans to extend the line onwards to Skien were launched. Pihl estimated the extension to cost NOK 4.5 million, in addition to a possible branch to Brevik.\n\nThe construction of the line was considered by Parliament in 1875. A political deal was struck, where representatives from the Vestfold area agreed to support the Voss Line while representatives from Hordaland supported the Jarlsberg Line. The decision, taken on 8 June 1875, was made with 76 against 36 votes, and supported the compromise coastal route with an extension to Skien. The line was budgeted to cost NOK 10.7 million, and shares of NOK 3.25 million had been sold.\n\nConstruction commenced in 1876, under the management of Pihl, Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Jørgen Meinich. The line received a minimum curve radius of and a maximum gradient of 1:55 (1.8%). The work was attempted halted twice in 1877 by parties issuing complaints. The first stated that the right-of-way should be built in preparation for conversion to standard gauge, the latter was an attempt to stall construction and instead place the route through the interior. Engineer Størmer launched a proposal in 1878 to instead build the line with standard gauge. This was considered by Parliament's Standing Committee on Railways, but voted down with five against four votes. The proposal was voted down in the plenary voting, with only 24 supporting standard gauge.\nThere were few difficulties building the line in the relatively flat landscape between Drammen and Larvik. The largest challenge was building through Kobbervikdalen. The navvies were uncomfortable building a cutting south of Holmestrand, where the line went through an old cemetery in clay ground and they would often find well-preserved corpses while digging. The section between Larvik and Skien went through considerably more hilly terrain, especially along the shore of Farrisvannet, which included more than twenty tunnels along a section of . At the peak, in 1879, there were 2,114 people working on the railway construction, receiving an average NOK 2.50 per day in wage.\n\nBecause King Oscar II happened to be touring Norway in October 1881, the railway between Drammen and Larvik was officially opened by him on 13 October 1881, including the branch to Horten. However, the construction was not completed and the line did not actually start operations until 7 December. The section from Larvik to Skien was officially opened on 24 November 1882. Construction cost NOK 12 million. The Brevik Line was taken out of the original plans and did not open until 15 October 1895.\n\nThe Vestfold Line was organized as part of the Norwegian State Railways' Drammen District. At first the line was trafficked with two daily combined passenger and freight trains in each direction, in addition to a freight services on weekdays. The most important train was the post train, a combined post and passenger express which departed Oslo West Station at 08 hours and returned from Skien at 15 hours. It used the newest rolling stock Vy had available. At Skoppum there was a corresponding local train to Horten. From the opening of the Brevik Line in 1895, local trains started running between Brevik and Skien, and an additional daily express train was set up run to Brevik, where there was a corresponding steamship service to Kristiansand.\n\nVy took delivery of five Class V steam locomotives, manufactured by Motala Verkstad and four lager tender Class XI locomotive built by Dübs and Company. The latter were mostly used for the express trains. The first compound locomotive, Class XIII, was taken into use in 1895. The next two were not compound: two Baldwin Locomotive Works locomotives were delivered in 1898. They remained in service until 1908, when they were transferred to the Røros Line. Two Class IX from Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works units were transferred to the Vestfold Line in 1897. Two more Class XIII were delivered in 1900. Two Class XXIIIa locomotives were delivered from Hamar Jernstøperi in 1907 and 1908, with a further ten Class XXIIId units delivered from Thune between 1913 and 1915. The line later received various other steam locomotives as narrow gauge railways were converted to standard gauge.\n\nDuring construction of a level crossing at Smørstein on 17 August 1918 the area around the track started experiencing a series of landslides. Within a few days the earthwork under the tracks had slid away. Vy hired a steamship to freight passengers and cargo past the effected area, and part of the traffic was freighted across the fjord from Horten to Moss. A temporary line was built close to the mountain, while construction took place of a temporary solution, the Smørstein Tunnel. The temporary line opened on 28 October 1918 and the new segment with a tunnel on 25 May 1921.\n\nThe Jarlsberg Line officially changed its name to the Vestfold Line on 1 July 1930. It received thirty-eight new stops in the period between 1928 and 1932.\n\nThe county council debated conversion of the line to standard gauge in 1910, and issued a request to the government. It considered the question in 1912, and granted funding for preliminary surveys. After petitioning from most municipal councils and various commercial interests in 1913, Parliament agreed to the funding in April 1914. A railway committee was established, and Drammen District proposed that its lines be converted. By the time the issue had reached Parliament in 1923, a conversion of the Vestfold Line had fallen out of the plans. However, several of the surrounding railways were converted to standard gauge.\n\nThe Drammen Line was converted to dual gauge between 1917 and 1920, and then only standard gauge from 13 November 1922. The Drammen Line was electrified in two stages, in 1922 and 1930. The Bratsberg Line opened between Notodden and Skien in 1917, and the section of the Vestfold Line from Skien to Eidanger was converted to dual gauge. From 16 June 1921 the line, including the branch to Brevik, was entirely standard gauge. This caused the trains from Skien and Porsgrunn to be re-routed via the Bratsberg Line Kongsvinger to Oslo.\n\nTrains on the Vestfold Line therefore terminated at Drammen, where passengers had to transfer to the Drammen Line. The low standard became a local political concern. The road director proposed closing the railway and building a highway, but the proposal met diminutive support. A propaganda committee was established in 1931, which in addition to gauge conversion insisted on that the line be rebuilt so it run via Horten. Parliament voted in favor on 26 June 1934 of converting the Vestfold Line. However, with the German occupation of Norway between 1940 and 1945, the Vestfold Line received a low priority and was hardly maintained. A new decision to convert the gauge was taken by Parliament in March 1946.\n\nIn 1949 there were twenty-one various versions of Class XXIII and two Class XXVI locomotives used on the Vestfold Line. New 25 kilograms per meter track were installed. However, the foundation was not resized to suit standard gauge. Between 170 and 240 men were employed and the works cost NOK 41 million. The gauge-converted railway, including the Horten Line, was taken into use on 3 October 1949. The Vestfold Line was the last railway in Norway to receive gauge conversion. Most of the remaining narrow gauge rolling stock was therefore sold to Sweden.\n\nThe Bratsberg and Brevik Line were electrified before the Vestfold Line, between 1936 and 1949. Electrification of the Vestfold Line took place in three segments. First the segment from Eidanger to Larvik was taken into use on 15 October 1956, then the segment from Larvik to Tønsberg on 20 May 1957 and finally the segment from Tønsberg to Drammen on 1 December 1957. Vy reallocated most and later all of their El 8 locomotives to Drammen District, resulting in them being frequently used on the Vestfold Line. Class 66 multiple units were introduced on the Vestfold Line on 28 May 1967. They ran on trains to Skien until 3 June 1973, after which it only served to Larvik. They were retired on 21 May 1977. El 11 locomotives were used on the Vestfold Line from the 1970s. From the late 1970s and early 1980s, these were replaced with El 13.\n\nCentralized traffic control was introduced is steps during the early 1970s. The section from Drammen to Holmestrand received it on 16 December 1970, the section onwards to Tønsberg on 1 July 1971, the section onwards to Sandefjord on 15 September 1971, the section onwards to Larvik on 27 October 1971, the section onwards to Porsgrunn on 16 December 1971. The port tracks in Holmestrand and Tønsberg were closed in 1980.\nA major change to the service on the Vestfold Line took place on 29 May 1978, when all smaller stations were closed. Vy introduced its new InterCityExpress concept, which resulted in an increase of patronage by twenty-five percent on the Vestfold Line. From 30 May 1980 the Oslo Tunnel opened, and trains from the Vestfold Line could terminate at Oslo East Station and continue onwards to Lillehammer. The same year a commuter association was started for the Vestfold Line. With the delivery of new B5 carriages, Vy was able to put additional B3 carriages in to use on the Vestfold Line. Automatic train stop was installed from Drammen to Larvik on 18 July 1990 and from Larvik to Skien on 28 November 1991.\n\nThe first stages of modernization of the Vestfold Line were carried out through a combination of new trains and sections of double track. Vy ordered of the Class 70 trains for their InterCityExpress services in 1988. Capable of speeds of , they were introduced on the Vestfold Line in 1992. The new trains increased capacity on the Vestfold Line with 2,100 seats per day. Vy soon found that the four-car trains had an unsuitable size: a single unit did not provide sufficient capacity while two units provided too much capacity. Despite the upgrades, by 1997 the trains from Larvik to Oslo were using twenty minutes longer than they were in 1973, and the average speed on the Vestfold Line was down to .\nStarting work in 1993, the first two section of the Vestfold Line to be upgraded were a double track segment from Kobbervikdalen to Skoger, and a segment from Åshaugen via a new Sande Station to Holm. The Skoger section opened in on 17 October 1995, while the section past Sande did not open until 23 October 2001. Part of the reason for five-year delay with the second segment was delays with the installation of the signaling system which was being carried out by Adtranz.\n\nIn September 1999, the government presented their proposal for National Transport Plan 2002–11, which included three segments on the Vestfold Line: Holm–Nykirke, Barkåker–Tønsberg and Farriseidet–Porsgrunn. When Parliament passed the plan in February 2001, the Barkåker–Tønsberg segment was prioritized second on the Vestfold Line, after a new passing loop at Nykirke. The passing loop was completed in 2002, the same year as all traffic on the Horten Line was terminated. Råstad Station reopened as Sandefjord Airport Station on 21 January 2007, serving Sandefjord Airport, Torp. This allowed the Vestfold Line to act as an airport rail link to Sandefjord Airport, Torp, which had during the 1990s grown as both a regional airport and as a low-cost airport for Ryanair.\nNational Transport Plan 2002–11 proposed that construction start in 2005, but by November 2002, the National Rail Administration delayed the plans, following investment cuts by Bondevik's Second Cabinet. In response, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that she was considering financing the project as a public–private partnership paid through a surcharge on tickets fares. Increased funding to railways commenced with the appointment of Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet in 2005. The go-ahead for the Barkåker–Tønsberg section, including the Jarlsberg Tunnel, was given by Minister of Transport Liv Signe Navarsete on 31 March 2008, estimated to cost 1.37 billion Norwegian krone (NOK).\n\nThe plan to make an isolated investment in the Barkåker–Tønsberg section was criticized by several pro-railway interest organizations, including Vy, which instead recommended that the National Rail Administration place the investments on hold until more of the Vestfold Line was planned. The short segment gives little operational advantages, while hindering a new line from running via the population centers of Horten, Åsgårdstrand and Eik. Construction of the project started on 16 March 2009, and opened on schedule on 7 November 2011. By then Vy had taken delivery of its new Class 74 units, which were put into service on the Vestfold Line. During trial runs a Class 74 unit derailed at Nykirke. The train was totaled, although no-one was seriously injured in the incident.\n\nBalthazar Lange was selected as the line's main architect, although some minor buildings were standardized designs by Peter Andreas Blix. Lange worked on the various plans from late 1879 to until July 1882, when he retired as a railway architect. He first designed three similar, town stations: Holmestrand, Sandefjord and Porsgrunn. Designed in Swiss chalet style, they each featured gablets in each end, on both the track and town side. The ends were more anonymous. The design gave a non-symmetrical feel around the end axis, with the town side appearing in two stories and the track side as one and a half. Holmestrand and Sandefjord have both been extensively rebuilt. The stations were smaller and cheaper with resemblance of Blix' contemporary Moss Station and Fredrikstad Station on the Østfold Line, across the fjord.\n\nThe only brick stations were Tønsberg Station and Larvik Station, designed in Historicism and Renaissance Revival. In addition to these stations' size, it was decisive that local building restrictions banned wooden buildings. The two stations had the same floor plan and design, but Larvik was slightly longer. Their design was inspired from the main farmhouses of Jarlsberg and Larvik. The stations were innovative for their design with a central vestibule with direct access to both the town and track sides, with branches to waiting rooms for second and third class. They were also innovative in that the upper floor, with the station-master's residence, was smaller than the ground floor.\nSkoppum Station, where the Horten Line branched off, was given an island platform design, with the station located between the two tracks. This, and the need for space for transshipment, gave the station an odd design, and the island location gave it difficult access from the surroundings. Six stations have been listed by the Directorate for Cultural Heritage: Skoppum, Tønsberg, Stokke, Råstad, the goods house at Sandefjord, the engine shed at Larvik Station, Eidanger Station and Borgestad Station.\n\nThe Vestfold Line is part of the Intercity Triangle, which the authorities wish to prioritize for future upgrades. The long-term goal is to construct a continuous high-speed double track from Oslo to Skien. This is in part a response to the E18 being upgraded to a motorway. In addition to increased speeds, the current line does not allow for more trains to operate. Plans call for an initial construction of the Inner Intercity Triangle, which will give continual double track from Tønsberg to Oslo, in addition to the shortening of the segment between Larvik and Porsgrunn. This will allow travel time from Tønsberg to Oslo to be reduced from 1 hour and 28 minutes to 1 hour. An upgrade of the rest of the line, scheduled for completion by 2030, will cut travel time from Porsgrunn to Oslo from 2 hours and 45 minutes to 1 hour and 36 minutes. The line could accommodate an estimated 9.5 million passengers per year, and each station could receive between 100 and 500 percent increase in patronage. Despite the plans for the upgrades of the Vestfold Line, there are no current plans for upgrading the line and tunnel between Asker and Drammen, which all trains must follow to Oslo and which has a maximum speed of .\nConstruction of the section of double track between Holm and Nykirke commenced on 16 August 2010. The segment will connect the passing loop at Nykirke and the double-tracked segment through Sande, giving a combined length of of high-speed double track. Designed for speeds of , the new segment will feature the Holmestrandfjellet Tunnel, which will contain the four-track Holmestrand Station. The segment is estimated to cost NOK 5.7 billion and is scheduled for completion in 2016.\n\nThe section of railway which runs between Farriseidet and Porsgrunn is in the process of being replaced with a new, high-speed section. It will reduce travel time between Larvik Station and Porsgrunn Station from 34 to 12 minutes. Originally planned as single track with two passing loops, it was upped to double track with surveys showing increased traffic should the Sørlandet Line be connected to the Vestfold Line with the construction of a proposed Grenland Line. The segment includes seven tunnels with a combined length of and five bridges. Municipal zoning of the segment was passed in July 2010, with construction commencing in September 2012. Construction is estimated to cost NOK 5.3 billion and is scheduled for completion in 2018.\nThere are proposals to connect the Vestfold Line with the Sørlandet Line via a new Grenland Line. It would connect to the Vestfold Line just north of Porsgrunn Station and would run from Porsgrunn to Skorstøl on the Sørlandet Line. The line is estimated to cost NOK 20-26 billion and would allow the travel time from Kragerø to Oslo of 2 hours and from Kristiansand to Oslo in 3 hours and 23 minutes. Passenger trains along the Sørlandet Line, and possibly freight trains, would be routed via the Vestfold Line. It is therefore necessary to complete the upgrade of the Vestfold Line before the Grenland Line is opened.\n\nThere are plans to build a new road crossing of the Oslofjord between Horten and Moss, which would replace the Moss–Horten Ferry. It could include a connection of the Vestfold Line with the Østfold Line. One alternative was a suspension bridge across Drøbaksundet, which could be built to accommodate trains and feature a main span of . A bridge or tunnel crossing further south would require more advanced technology and presumably consist of combination of various bridge technologies, including as a pontoon bridge or a submerged floating tunnel.\n\nThe Norwegian National Transport Plan for 2018-2029 states that one of the priorities for the railway system is to establish a continuous double track between Oslo and Tønsberg by the end of 2024, and a completed double track all the way to Skien in 2032.\n\n"}

During the election in 1901 he was elected as the president from 1901 to 1903. At that time there were 34 towns in the province of Capiz, but these were reduced to 24 towns by a law passed by the civil Commission when it was found out that some towns were incapable of meeting their financial obligations and maintenance. So on April 4, 1903, through Act No. 720 of the Philippine Commission, Lezo, along with Numancia, and Banga was annexed to Kalibo for decreased of revenue collections.\n\nOn July 31, 1909, the civil commission passed another law separating Lezo (that includes Numancia) from Kalibo and making Lezo as the seat of government. Numancia then, became a \"barrio\" of Lezo. On December 31, 1916, through \"Act No. 2657\", Lezo was part of the second district of the province of Capiz. In 1920 the situation was reversed with regards to the status of Lezo and Numancia. By \"Executive Order No. 17\", series of 1920, the seat of government was transferred to Numancia and Lezo became a \"barrio\" of Numancia.\n\nWith several petitions by the residents over the years to separate from Numancia, President Manuel Quezon signed \"Executive Order No. 364\" dated August 28, 1941 converting Lezo into an independent municipality.

The genus is native to southwestern North America from western Texas to New Mexico and Arizona in the United States, and south through Chihuahua, Coahuila and Nuevo León in northern Mexico. Members of the genus are commonly known as mescalbean, mescal bean or frijolito. One of the common names of \"Dermatophyllum secundiflorum\" is Texas mountain laurel, although the name mountain laurel also refers to the very dissimilar and unrelated genus \"Kalmia\" (family Ericaceae) and the name laurel refers generally to plants in the unrelated order Laurales.\n\nAlthough still commonly treated in the genus \"Sophora\", recent genetic evidence has shown that the mescalbeans are only distantly related to the other species of \"Sophora\".\n\n\"Dermatophyllum\" comprises the following species:\n\n\n\n\"Dermatophyllum\" spp. grow to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter, often growing in dense thickets that grow from basal shoots. The leaves are evergreen, leathery, long, pinnate with 5-11 oval leaflets, long and broad. The flowers, produced in spring, are fragrant, purple, typical pea-flower in shape, borne in erect or spreading racemes long. The fruit is a hard, woody seedpod long, containing 1-6 oval bright red seeds long and in diameter.\n\nAll parts of the mescalbeans are very poisonous, containing the alkaloid cytisine (\"not\" mescaline, as suggested by the name). Nevertheless, there is evidence of the seeds of the plant having been used in a ritualistic context as a hallucinogen by some Native American peoples. The symptoms of cytisine poisoning are very unpleasant. This has led to speculation that the peyote cult may have developed as a relatively safe substitute for the potentially toxic mescalbean, given the close parallels in performance and divination between the two (including leaders of Plains Indian peyote rituals wearing a necklace of mescalbeans).\n"}

{"id": "2050667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050667", "title": "Quantum tomography", "text": "Quantum tomography\n\nQuantum tomography or quantum state tomography is the process by which a quantum state is reconstructed using measurements on an ensemble of identical quantum states. The source of these states may be any device or system which prepares quantum states either consistently into quantum pure states or otherwise into general mixed states. To be able to uniquely identify the state, the measurements must be tomographically complete. That is, the measured operators must form an operator basis on the Hilbert space of the system, providing all the information about the state. Such a set of observations is sometimes called a quorum. \n\nIn quantum process tomography on the other hand, known quantum states are used to probe a quantum process to find out how the process can be described. Similarly, quantum measurement tomography works to find out what measurement is being performed. Whereas, randomized benchmarking scalably obtains a figure of merit of the overlap between the error prone physical quantum process and its ideal counterpart.\n\nThe general principle behind quantum state tomography is that by repeatedly performing many different measurements on quantum systems described by identical density matrices, frequency counts can be used to infer probabilities, and these probabilities are combined with Born's rule to determine a density matrix which fits the best with the observations.\n\nThis can be easily understood by making a classical analogy. Consider a harmonic oscillator (e.g. a pendulum). The position and momentum of the oscillator at any given point can be measured and therefore the motion can be completely described by the phase space. This is shown in figure 1. By performing this measurement for a large number of identical oscillators we get a possibility distribution in the phase space (figure 2). This distribution can be normalized (the oscillator at a given time has to be somewhere) and the distribution must be non-negative. So we have retrieved a function W(x,p) which gives a description of the chance of finding the particle at a given point with a given momentum. \nFor quantum mechanical particles the same can be done. The only difference is that the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle mustn’t be violated, meaning that we cannot measure the particle's momentum and position at the same time. The particle's momentum and its position are called quadratures (see Optical phase space for more information) in quantum related states. By measuring one of the quadratures of a large number of identical quantum states will give us a probability density corresponding to that particular quadrature. This is called the marginal distribution, pr(X) or pr(P) (see figure 3). In the following text we will see that this probability density is needed to characterize the particle's quantum state, which is the whole point of quantum tomography. \n\nQuantum tomography is applied on a source of systems, to determine the quantum state of the output of that source. Unlike a measurement on a single system, which determines the system's current state after the measurement (in general, the act of making a measurement alters the quantum state), quantum tomography works to determine the state(s) prior to the measurements.\n\nQuantum tomography can be used for characterizing optical signals, including measuring the signal gain and loss of optical devices, as well as in quantum computing and quantum information theory to reliably determine the actual states of the qubits. One can imagine a situation in which a person Bob prepares some quantum states and then gives the states to Alice to look at. Not confident with Bob's description of the states, Alice may wish to do quantum tomography to classify the states herself.\n\nUsing Born's rule, one can derive the simplest form of quantum tomography. Generally, being in a pure state is not known, and a state may be mixed. In this case, many different measurements will have to be performed, many times each. To fully reconstruct the density matrix for a mixed state in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, the following technique may be used.\n\nBorn's rule states formula_1, where formula_2 is a particular measurement outcome projector and formula_3 is the density matrix of the system.\nGiven a histogram of observations for each measurement, one has an approximation\nformula_4 to formula_5 for each formula_2.\n\nGiven linear operators formula_7 and formula_8, define the inner product\nwhere formula_10 is representation of the formula_8 operator as a column vector and formula_12 a row vector such that formula_13 is the inner product in formula_14 of the two.\n\nDefine the matrix formula_15 as\nHere \"E\" is some fixed list of individual measurements (with binary outcomes), and \"A\" does all the measurements at once.\n\nThen applying this to formula_17 yields the probabilities:\n\nLinear inversion corresponds to inverting this system using the observed relative frequencies formula_19 to derive formula_20 (which is isomorphic to formula_21).\n\nThis system is not going to be square in general, as for each measurement being made there will generally be multiple measurement outcome projectors formula_2. For example, in a 2-D Hilbert space with 3 measurements formula_23, each measurement has 2 outcomes, each of which has a projector \"E\", for 6 projectors, whereas the real dimension of the space of density matrices is (2⋅2)/2=4, leaving formula_15 to be 6 x 4. To solve the system, multiply on the left by formula_25:\nNow solving for formula_27 yields the pseudoinverse:\n\nThis works in general only if the measurement list \"E\" is tomographically complete. Otherwise, the matrix formula_29 will not be invertible.\n\nIn infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, e.g. in measurements of continuous variables such as position, the methodology is somewhat more complex. One notable example is in the tomography of light, known as optical homodyne tomography. Using balanced homodyne measurements, one can derive the Wigner function and a density matrix for the state of the light.\n\nOne approach involves measurements along different rotated directions in phase space. For each direction formula_30, one can find a probability distribution formula_31 for the probability density of measurements in the formula_30 direction of phase space yielding the value formula_33. Using an inverse Radon transformation (the filtered back projection) on formula_31 leads to the Wigner function, formula_35, which can be converted by an inverse Fourier transform into the density matrix for the state in any basis. A similar technique is often used in medical tomography.\n\nField amplitudes or quadratures with high efficiencies can be measured with photodetectors together with temporal mode selectivity. Balanced homodyne tomography is a reliable technique of reconstructing quantum states in the optical domain. This technique combines the advantages of the high efficiencies of photodiodes in measuring the intensity or photon number of light, together with measuring the quantum features of light by a clever set-up called the homodyne tomography detector. This is explained by the following example. \nA laser is directed onto a 50-50% beamsplitter, splitting the laserbeam into two beams. One is used as local oscillator (LO) and the other is used to generate photons with a particular quantum state. The generation of quantum states can be realized, e.g. by directing the laser beam through a frequency doubling crystal and then onto a parametric down-conversion crystal. This crystal generates two photons in a certain quantum state. One of the photons is used as a trigger signal used to trigger (start) the readout event of the homodyne tomography detector. The other photon is directed into the homodyne tomography detector, in order to reconstruct its quantum state. Since the trigger and signal photons are entangled (this is explained by the Spontaneous parametric down-conversion article), it is important to realize, that the optical mode of the signal state is created nonlocal only when the trigger photon impinges the photodetector (of the trigger event readout module) and is actually measured. More simply said, it is only when the trigger photon is measured, that the signal photon can be measured by the homodyne detector.\n\nNow consider the homodyne tomography detector as depicted in figure 4 (figure missing). The signal photon (this is the quantum state we want to reconstruct) interferes with the local oscillator, when they are directed onto a 50-50% beamsplitter. Since the two beams originate from the same so called master laser, they have the same fixed phase relation. The local oscillator must be intense, compared to the signal so it provides a precise phase reference. The local oscillator is so intense, that we can treat it classically (a = α) and neglect the quantum fluctuations. \nThe signal field is spatially and temporally controlled by the local oscillator, which has a controlled shape. Where the local oscillator is zero, the signal is rejected. Therefore, we have temporal-spatial mode selectivity of the signal. \nThe beamsplitter redirects the two beams to two photodetectors. The photodetectors generate an electric current proportional to the photon number. The two detector currents are subtracted and the resulting current is proportional to the electric field operator in the signal mode, depended on relative optical phase of signal and local oscillator.\n\nSince the electric field amplitude of the local oscillator is much higher than that of the signal the intensity or fluctuations in the signal field can be seen. The homodyne tomography system functions as an amplifier. The system can be seen as an interferometer with such a high intensity reference beam (the local oscillator) that unbalancing the interference by a single photon in the signal is measurable. This amplification is well above the photodetectors noise floor.\n\nThe measurement is reproduced a large number of times. Then the phase difference between the signal and local oscillator is changed in order to ‘scan’ a different angle in the phase space. This can be seen from figure 4. The measurement is repeated again a large number of times and a marginal distribution is retrieved from the current difference. The marginal distribution can be transformed into the density matrix and/or the Wigner function. Since the density matrix and the Wigner function give information about the quantum state of the photon, we have reconstructed the quantum state of the photon.\n\nThe advantage of this method is that this arrangement is insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser.\n\nThe quantum computations for retrieving the quadrature component from the current difference are performed as follows.\n\nThe photon number operator for the beams striking the photodetectors after the beamsplitter is given by: \nwhere i is 1 and 2, for respectively beam one and two.\nThe mode operators of the field emerging the beamsplitters are given by:\nThe formula_39 denotes the annihilation operator of the signal and alpha the complex amplitude of the local oscillator. \nThe number of photon difference is eventually proportional to the quadrature and given by:\nRewriting this with the relation: \nResults in the following relation: \nwhere we see clear relation between the photon number difference and the quadrature component formula_43. By keeping track of the sum current, one can recover information about the local oscillator's intensity, since this is usually an unknown quantity, but an important quantity for calculating the quadrature component formula_43.\n\nOne of the primary problems with using linear inversion to solve for the density matrix is that in general the computed solution will not be a valid density matrix. For example, it could give negative probabilities or probabilities greater than 1 to certain measurement outcomes. This is particularly an issue when fewer measurements are made.\n\nAnother issue is that in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, an infinite number of measurement outcomes would be required. Making assumptions about the structure and using a finite measurement basis leads to artifacts in the phase space density.\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation (also known as MLE or MaxLik) is a popular technique for dealing with the problems of linear inversion. By restricting the domain of density matrices to the proper space, and searching for the density matrix which maximizes the likelihood of giving the experimental results, it guarantees the state to be theoretically valid while giving a close fit to the data. The likelihood of a state is the probability that would be assigned to the observed results had the system been in that state.\n\nSuppose the measurements formula_45 have been observed with frequencies formula_46. Then the likelihood associated with a state formula_47 is\nwhere formula_49 is the probability of outcome formula_50 for the state formula_47.\n\nFinding the maximum of this function is non-trivial and generally involves iterative methods. The methods are an active topic of research.\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation suffers from some less obvious problems than linear inversion. One problem is that it makes predictions about probabilities that cannot be justified by the data. This is seen most easily by looking at the problem of zero eigenvalues. The computed solution using MLE often contains eigenvalues which are 0, i.e. it is rank deficient. In these cases, the solution then lies on the boundary of the n-dimensional Bloch sphere. This can be seen as related to linear inversion giving states which lie outside the valid space (the Bloch sphere). MLE in these cases picks a nearby point that is valid, and the nearest points are generally on the boundary.\n\nThis is not physically a problem, the real state might have zero eigenvalues. However, since no value may be less than 0, an estimate of an eigenvalue being 0 implies that the estimator is certain the value is 0, otherwise they would have estimated some formula_52 greater than 0 with a small degree of uncertainty as the best estimate. This is where the problem arises, in that it is not logical to conclude with absolute certainty after a finite number of measurements that any eigenvalue (that is, the probability of a particular outcome) is 0. For example, if a coin is flipped 5 times and each time heads was observed, it does not mean there is 0 probability of getting tails, despite that being the most \"likely\" description of the coin.\n\nBayesian mean estimation (BME) is a relatively new approach which addresses the problems of maximum likelihood estimation. It focuses on finding optimal solutions which are also \"honest\" in that they include error bars in the estimate. The general idea is to start with a likelihood function and a function describing the experimenter's prior knowledge (which might be a constant function), then integrate over all density matrices using the product of the likelihood function and prior knowledge function as a weight.\n\nGiven a reasonable prior knowledge function, BME will yield a state strictly within the n-dimensional bloch sphere. In the case of a coin flipped N times to get N heads described above, with a constant prior knowledge function, BME would assign formula_53 as the probability for tails.\n\nBME provides a high degree of accuracy in that it minimizes the \"operational divergences\" of the estimate from the actual state.\n\nThe number of measurements needed for a full quantum state tomography for a multi-particle system scales exponentially with the number of particles, which\nmakes such a procedure impossible even for modest system sizes. Hence, several methods have been developed to \nrealize quantum tomography with fewer measurements.\n\nThe concept of matrix completion and compressed sensing have been applied to reconstruct density matrices from an incomplete set of measurements (that is, a set of measurements which is not a quorum). In general, this is impossible, but under assumptions (for example, if the density matrix is a pure state, or a combination of just a few pure states) then the density matrix has fewer degrees of freedom, and it may be possible to reconstruct the state from the incomplete measurements.\n\nPermutationally Invariant Quantum Tomography\nis a procedure that has been developed mostly for states that are close to being \npermutationally symmetric, which is typical in nowadays experiments. For two-state particles, the number of measurements needed scales only quadratically with the number of particles.\n\nBesides the modest measurement effort, the processing of the measured data can also be done efficiently:\nIt is possible to carry out the fitting of a physical density matrix on the measured data even for large systems.\n\nPermutationally Invariant Quantum Tomography has been combined with compressed sensing in a six-qubit\nphotonic experiment.\n\nOne can imagine a situation in which an apparatus performs some measurement on quantum systems, and determining what particular measurement is desired. The strategy is to send in systems of various known states, and use these states to estimate the outcomes of the unknown measurement. Also known as \"quantum estimation\", tomography techniques are increasingly important including those for quantum measurement tomography and the very similar quantum state tomography. Since a measurement can always be characterized by a set of POVM's, the goal is to reconstruct the characterizing POVM's formula_54. The simplest approach is linear inversion. As in quantum state observation, use\nExploiting linearity as above, this can be inverted to solve for the formula_54.\n\nNot surprisingly, this suffers from the same pitfalls as in quantum state tomography: namely, non-physical results, in particular negative probabilities. Here the formula_54 will not be valid POVM's, as they will not be positive. Bayesian methods as well as Maximum likelihood estimation of the density matrix can be used to restrict the operators to valid physical results.\n\nQuantum process tomography (QPT) deals with identifying an unknown quantum dynamical process. The first approach, introduced in 1996 and sometimes known as standard quantum process tomography (SQPT) involves preparing an ensemble of quantum states and sending them through the process, then using quantum state tomography to identify the resultant states. Other techniques include ancilla-assisted process tomography (AAPT) and entanglement-assisted process tomography (EAPT) which require an extra copy of the system.\n\nEach of the techniques listed above are known as \"indirect methods\" for characterization of quantum dynamics, since they require the use of quantum state tomography to reconstruct the process. In contrast, there are \"direct methods\" such as direct characterization of quantum dynamics (DCQD) which provide a full characterization of quantum systems without any state tomography.\n\nThe number of experimental configurations (state preparations and measurements) required for full quantum process tomography grows exponentially with the number of constituent particles of a system. Consequently, in general, QPT is an impossible task for large-scale quantum systems. However, under weak decoherence assumption, a quantum dynamical map can find a sparse representation. The method of compressed quantum process tomography (CQPT) uses the compressed sensing technique and applies the sparsity assumption to reconstruct a quantum dynamical map from an incomplete set of measurements or test state preparations.\n\nA quantum process, also known as a quantum dynamical map, formula_58, can be described by a completely positive map\nwhere formula_60, the bounded operators on Hilbert space; with \"operation elements\" formula_61 satisfying formula_62 so that formula_63.\n\nLet formula_64 be an orthogonal basis for formula_65. Write the formula_61 operators in this basis\nThis leads to\nwhere formula_69.\n\nThe goal is then to solve for formula_70, which is a positive superoperator and completely characterizes formula_71 with respect to the formula_64 basis.\n\nSQPT approaches this using formula_73 linearly independent inputs formula_74, where formula_75 is the dimension of the Hilbert space formula_76. For each of these input states formula_74, sending it through the process gives an output state formula_58 which can be written as a linear combination of the formula_79, i.e. formula_80. By sending each formula_74 through many times, quantum state tomography can be used to determine the coefficients formula_82 experimentally.\n\nWrite\nwhere formula_84 is a matrix of coefficients.\nThen\nSince formula_79 form a linearly independent basis, \nInverting formula_84 gives formula_89:\n"}

It bounded on the north by Sibuyan Sea; on the south by Pandan, Antique; east by Ibajay; and west by Malay.\n\nAccounts about the earliest community of Nabas are uncertain but the initial documentation for the town's existence was recorded in 1845. Facing the Sibuyan Sea, the town started as a small coastal village referred to as \"Barrio Alimbo\" which extends to the hills and mountains to the west. This small community occupies the floodplains of \"Alimbo River\" where the village derived its name. Fishing and farming is the primary source of livelihood, even today except for the hunting which was common on that time because of the abundances of wild pig, monkey and deer in the area.\n\nBefore, the town was part of the municipality of Ibajay under the jurisdiction of Capiz Province. Ibajay's municipal boundary was so vast but with poor road system.\n\nThe developing populaces whose tongue and customs diverge from those of the eastern community build awareness amongst people of the west. The invasion of migrants from the nearby province of Antique continued that further emphasized the difference in dialect and culture to some extent. In 1853, their notion of a separate municipality for better living and independence serves as the foundation for taking apart of Alimbo in concert with its adjoining barrios of Nagustan, \"Panaytayon\" (Toledo), Gibon, \"Namao\" (Rizal), \"Kabangrosan\" (Union), and \"Pakilawa\" (Unidos) ceased to be a barrio to form a new municipality inevitably.\nThe municipality was formed in 1854 and named Navas, after Governor Nava of the province of Capiz who came to inspect the area before its creation.\n\nThe \"Cartilla System\", an early teaching methods that dominantly use the letter \"b\" than \"v\" caused the variable spelling of \"Navas\" and \"Nabas\". In 1906, the Municipal Council in a resolution approved by unanimous vote adopted the name Nabas as the official name.\n\nNabas is from Kalibo, the provincial capital.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aklan.\n\nNabas is an elongated strip of land situated along the northwestern tip of Aklan province with its 21-kilometer coastline facing Sibuyan Sea with such a large span of municipal waters, approximately 300 square kilometers. Stretching mountain range on the opposite side approaches the shores on the northwestern part of the town. This town features natural wonders both on the mountains with its natural cold springs, caves and tiny water falls, and the sea which boast of crystal clear waters, coral reefs, and from grey or white sand to pebbly shores.\n\nNabas is politically subdivided into 20 barangays.\n\nNabas holds the record of fastest growing population in the whole province of Aklan covering a period of five years from 2011–2015.\n\nIn the , Nabas had a population of . The population density was .\n\nThe residents of Nabas speak two distinct dialects. The eastern half of the municipality has the dialect influenced and similar to Karay-a, spoken by the neighboring \"Antiqueños\", particularly the people from the towns Libertad, Pandan, and Sebaste of Antique. Those in the western half speak a dialect currently regarded as Malaynon with softer intonation. Aklanon and Hiligaynon are also used as a regional language by the natives. \"Gee-words\", an argot language has been popular among teenagers for over a decade.\n\nNabas, a 4th class municipality, is noted for its hat and mat industry made of indigenous bariw leaves which abound on the hillsides and plain lowlands of the town. It is likewise a farming and fishing community with its vast lowlands and elongated strips of shoreline. While the cost of marine commodity has soared due to the proximity of Nabas to Boracay Island, the fishermen remained impoverished.\n\nSigns of gradual progress can be seen in its urban center but mainly the income inflows can be felt in the families with relatives working abroad. Some Nabasnons have likewise turned businessmen because of the tourism industry ignited by Boracay Island. \n\nThe town serves as a satellite area for the expansion of tourism from the traditional town of Malay to expand and stretch developments to Nabas. The expansion of the Caticlan International Airport in Malay overlapped into the jurisdiction of Nabas.\n\nOne of the most imposing presence in Nabas is PetroWind Energy Inc. 36-megawatt wind farm in Pawa. An array of gigantic wind turbines lined-up along a mountain ridge aimed to spur tourism and add livelihood in the area.\n\nThe Nabas Bariw Festival is celebrated to commemorate the feast day of Saint Isidore the Farmer, the town's patron saint. It is celebrated annually from May 12 to 15. This celebration showcases the town's hat, mat and other \"bariw\" products as well as the town's unique tourism sites and natural attractions.\n\nDuring this affair, various skills in mat, hat and bag making and designing are demonstrated. Among the events is a contest to produce the biggest hat and mat contest. The festival is highlighted by continuous street dancing by folks from the town's 20 barangays dressed in colorful \"bariw\" costumes accompanied by indigenous bamboo instruments.\n\nThe festival is intended to promote the town's cottage industry, which is a thriving livelihood activity in Nabas. It also promotes the town's well preserved cold spring resorts, lagoons, long winding coastline, rivers, and low elevation intact forest, home to various endemic flora and fauna.\n\n"}
{"id": "2050671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050671", "title": "Managed retreat", "text": "Managed retreat\n\nManaged retreat refers to the purposeful, coordinated movement of people and buildings away from risks. This may involve the movement of a person, infrastructure (e.g., building or road), or community. It can occur in response to a variety of hazards such as flood, wildfire, or drought. In the context of coastal erosion, managed realignment allows an area that was not previously exposed to flooding by the sea to become flooded by removing coastal protection. This process is usually pursued in low-lying estuarine areas and almost always involves flooding of land that has at some point in the past been claimed from the sea. \n\nThe type of managed retreat depends on the location and type of natural hazard. In the United Kingdom, managed realignment through removal of flood defences is often a response to sea level rise exacerbated by local subsidence of the land surface due to post-glacial isostatic rebound in the north. In the United States, managed retreat often occurs through voluntary acquisition and demolition or relocation of at-risk properties by the government. In the Global South, relocation might occur through government programs. Some low-lying nations, facing inundation due to sea level rise, are planning for the relocation of their populations, such as Kiribati planning for \"Migration with Dignity.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom the main reason for implementation of managed realignment is generally to improve coastal stability, essentially replacing artificial ‘hard’ coastal defences with natural ‘soft’ coastal landforms (Pethick 2002). According to University of Southampton researchers Matthew M. Linham and Robert J. Nicholls \"one of the biggest drawbacks of managed realignment is that the option requires land to be yielded to the sea.\" One of the benefits, however, is that the process can help protect areas of land further inland by creating natural spaces that act as buffers to absorb water or dampen the force of waves.\n\nManaged realignment has also been used to mitigate for loss of intertidal habitat. Although land reclamation has been an important factor for salt marsh loss in the UK in the past (Allen 1992) the majority of current salt marsh loss in the UK is believed to be due to erosion. This erosion may involve coastal squeeze, where protective sea walls prevent the landward migration of salt marsh in response to sea level rise when sediment supply is limited. Salt marshes are protected under the EU Habitats Directive as well as providing habitat for a number of species protected by the Birds Directive (see Natura 2000). Following this guidance, the UK’s biodiversity action plan aims to prevent net losses to the area of salt marsh present in 1992. It is, therefore, a legal requirement that all losses in marsh area must be compensated by replacement habitat with equivalent biological characteristics. This equates to the need to restore approximately 1.4km² of salt marsh habitat per year in the UK. One of the major reasons cited for the slow pace of current salt marsh restoration in the UK is the uncertainty associated with the practice (Foresight).\n\nThere are no agreed protocols on the monitoring of MR sites and, consequently, very few of the sites are being monitored consistently and effectively. Due to the low levels of monitoring there is little evidence on which to base future managed realignment projects. This has led to the results of Managed Realignment schemes being extremely unpredictable.\n\nManaged retreat in the form of relocation has been used in inland and coastal areas in response to severe flooding and hurricanes. In the United States, this often takes the form of \"buyout\" programs, in which government acquires and relocates or demolishes at-risk properties. In some cases, individual homes are purchased after disasters. In other cases, such as Odamah and Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, or Valmeyer, Illinois, the entire community has relocated.\n\nManaged retreat can be very controversial. A law suit in Del Mar California brought on by residents was initiated to stop a managed retreat program based on worries that home values, insurance costs and restricted home expansion have been effects of the policy. Some areas included in Managed Retreat are above sea level and are recommended based primarily on estimated engineering costs and by studies financed by the California Coastal Commission itself. \n\nDespite the controversy, as the costs of climate change adaptation increase, more communities are beginning to consider managed retreat.\n\nIn the UK, the first managed retreat site was an area of at Northey Island in Essex flooded in 1991, followed by larger sites at Tollesbury and Orplands (1995), Freiston Shore (2001) and Abbott's Hall Farm, at Great Wigborough in the Blackwater Estuary, it is one of the largest managed retreat schemes in Europe. It covers nearly of land on the north side of the estuary (2002) and a number of others. The programme was started by the Essex Wildlife Trust (EST) who own Abbott's Hall Farm. They made five breaches in the original old sea wall to allow the held-back sea to flood through to create salt marshland. The marshland over time reverted to its original state before cultivation, providing excellent bird habitat and breeding grounds.\n\n\n"}

The municipality was formerly called \"Fonda Lagatic\", which was derived from Lagatik River that stretches along some of the municipality's barangays at a length of .\n\nNew Washington is located at .\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aklan.\n\nNew Washington is bounded by Batan in the east, Kalibo in the west and the Sibuyan Sea on the north. It is from Kalibo International Airport, from the province's capital town of Kalibo, and one and a half (1) hours away from Boracay Island.\n\nThe third type of climate predominates in the locality, season not pronounced. It is relatively dry from February to July and wet the rest of the year.\n\nOf note, to deal with water supply along the long peninsula affected by salt water intrusion and related endemic amoebiasis caused by unreinforced water wells, New Washington was the site of a unique U.S. Peace Corps-sponsored program to build low-cost concrete-lined water wells with locally manufactured \"curved hollow blocks\" inspired by local medical doctor Andrew Mendoza. Well over 200 water wells were built during the early 1980s. USAID considered the water wells to be the most cost-effective solution for avoiding salt water intrusion.\n\nNew Washington is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.\n\nTo some locals, the barangays are grouped into two, namely \"Eanas\" and \"Baybay\". The barangays that belong to Eanas are those involved in rice farming such as Mabilo, Puis, Jalas, Guinbaliwan, Mataphao, Candelaria, Lawa-an and Jugas. Baybay, on the other hand, covers barangays along or near the coastline, consisting of Tambac, Poblacion, Pinamuk-an, Polo, Cawayan, Ochando, Fatima and Dumaguit.\n\nCommon among municipalities in the Philippines, the seat of local government and the center of business are situated in Poblacion. It is also home to the Municipal Auditorium and Sports Complex, where major events of the town are held.\n\nIn the , New Washington had a population of . The population density was .\n\nIn the 2007 census, there were 39,656 residents, an increase by 16.7% since the year 2000 when the official count was 33,981. In the 2010 census, the population had increased to 42,112 persons.\n\nMajority of the \"New Washingtonian\"s, as the municipality's residents are sometimes called, are of Aklanon origin. Immigration, generally, is due to marriage and employment.\n\nNew Washingtonians speak in Aklanon, Hiligaynon, Filipino and English, the former being their primary medium. Aklanon, as a language, is often described as a cross between Bisaya, Hiligaynon and Karay-a making it quite complicated for local and foreign tourists to speak and comprehend. This is not seen as a problem, considering that residents can speak fluent Hiligaynon, Tagalog, and English. \n\nThe people of New Washington are predominantly Christians. Religious denominations in the municipality include Roman Catholic Church, Philippine Independent Church, Baptist churches, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jehovah's Witnesses and Church of the Latter Day Saints, among others.\n\nAs New Washington is surrounded by bodies of water such as Sibuyan Sea and Lagatik River. Fishing has been the leading livelihood among the people, alongside rice farming. The town has the largest area of ricefields among the municipalities in Aklan.\n\nThe municipality operates two ports: one in Dumaguit and the other in Poblacion. The port in Dumaguit caters to passenger and commercial boats, while the port in Poblacion is only for the latter. Both ports serve as major trade routes between the province of Aklan and Manila.\n\nThe town has several edifices that have historical or spiritual significance and locations for leisure and relaxation. These include the NHI-recognized commemorative monument of its native son His Eminence Jaime Cardinal Lachica Sin and the Diocesan Shrine of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary in Poblacion, the Pink Sisters' Immaculata Adoration Convent in Polo, the Sunrise/Sunset Viewing at Tambak Seawall and the Sampaguita Gardens Resort in Poblacion.\n\nAll the barangays have either an elementary or primary school. There are four secondary schools: \"New Washington National Comprehensive High School\" and \"Montfort Technical Institute\" (MTI) in Poblacion, \"Candelaria National High School\" in Candelaria and \"Ochando National High School\" in Ochando. \"Montessori de Aklan\" (MDA),a primary school,is a branch of \"Montessori de Zamboanga Schools\" which is an affiliate of AMS or \"American Montessori Society\" in Polo, Tertiary education is centered at Aklan State University - College of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, which is located in Poblacion. Vocational courses are also offered at MTI. Some families send their children to schools in Kalibo, Capiz, Iloilo and Manila, among others.\n\nNew Washington observes two annual fiestas as a town. One is a patronal fiesta in honor of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary, which is held on the second Saturday of October and the other is a civic fiesta commemorating the heroes of \"Pacto de Sangre\", which is held from March 1 to 3. The Pacto de Sangre, or blood compact, took place in the then Sitio Kuntang (now Barangay Ochando) on March 3, 1897. It was participated in by New Washingtonians of the past as a show of support to the Filipinos' revolution against the Spaniards. A commemorative marker was put up in the area where the event took place in Barangay Ochando. While the patronal fiesta is characterized by pious reflection, the civic fiesta involves three days of merry-making.\n\nAs of May 14, 2019, the municipal officials are:\n\n\nTo be updated.\nThe municipality has numerous beach resorts located near the shores from Mabilo to Dumaguit. The past decade saw an influx of inland resorts. The inland resorts in the town are mostly in Poblacion, some of which include Sampaguita Gardens Resort, Maria Mercedes Resort and Frogs Hollow Resort. For free means of leisure and entertainment, residents go to the town plaza, which houses the Jaime Cardinal L. Sin Park, the Rizal Park, the Municipal Children's Park and the Municipal Auditorium and Sports Complex.\n\nWell-known restaurants in the town include Oriental Flavors (fine-dining) and Poolside Restaurant at Sampaguita Gardens, and the Residence River Restaurant (Seafoods) in Tambak.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nNumancia is bounded on the east by Kalibo, the north by the Sibuyan Sea, the west by Makato, and the south by Lezo.\n\nNumancia is from Kalibo, the provincial capital.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aklan.\n\nNumancia is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. Of these, Poblacion, Bulwang, Laguinbanua East and West are urban, and the rest are classified as rural.\n\nThe original name of Numancia is \"Majanos\". The name Majanos, of Malayan in origin, could mean \"lowland\" for this is the only town in the Province of Aklan that has no highland or even a small hill. From Numancia one can view the mountain of Majaas with its peak shaped like a \"sarok\" or \"sadok\". The name \"Madyaas\" could have been a derivative of the word \"mataas\" meaning \"high\".\n\nWhen the ten Malay Datus arrived from Borneo, they bought the island of Panay, formerly called the \"Aninipay\" from the Aeta Chief Marikudo. The transaction was known as the barter of Panay, Datu Puti gave a \"sarok\" to Marikudo and the gold necklace of Kapinagan, and wife of Datu Puti was given to Maniwangtiwan, the wife of Marikudo. There were other goods involved in the transaction and Marikudo gave the lowland area to Datu Puti and members of his party while Marikudo and his tribe occupied the high lands or the hills and the mountains.\n\nIn about the year 1213 A.D. after having explored the whole island, the Malay leaders met and organized the Madjaas Confederacy or the \"Katilingban it Madjaas\". They divided the islands in three \"sakops\" or provinces and naming them Akean, Hantik and Irong-Irong. Sumakwel was assigned as head of Hantik, Bangkaya was assigned as head of Akean, and Paiburong was assigned as head of Irong-Irong. Sumakwel who was the senior among the three heads was chosen by popular votes to head the confederation.\n\nThe capitals of each sakop or province are the following: Bugasong in Hantik, Ogtom in Irong-Irong and Madjanos in Akean. Since Sumakwel was the first punu-an of the Madjaas Confederacy, Bugasong was the first capital of Panay.\n\nMany historical accounts have different versions about the exact locations of the first settlement established by Bangkaya in Aklan. In Numancia there is still the small river called Madjanos that serves the boundary between Marianos and Languinbanwa. This river used to be wide and navigable. According to the old folks, sailboats used to sail up to this river but because of floods, mudflows and silting, it became narrow and shallow.\n\nBarangay Marianos could be the very place where Datu bangkaya and his family lived together with the other Malay families who arrived with him. The present name of this barangay was corrupted to Marianos. It is not difficult to guess with less margin of error that the original name of this barangay is Madjanos considering that the Madjanos River is still there retaining its old name. The “d” in Madjanos in the course of time was eroded and replaced by letter “r” due to the dominance of the letter “r” in the Spanish language. Add the fact that the former priest by the name of Padre Mariano formerly lived in this barangay must have gradually influenced the corruption of the name Madjanos to Marianos.\n\nIn the course of time, Madjanos like the other settlements in the island of Panay became a thriving community. The population increased and more settlers came. Many other settlements were established and were scattered throughout the whole province up to what is now the province of Capiz, Capiz was formerly a part of Aklan but later the whole province was named Capiz during the arrival of Legaspi in Panay.\n\nThe eighteenth century records in the national archive and historical sketches by some local chroniclers show that there were two names mentioned pertaining to the town of Numancia. They were Madjanos and Lawan. Lawan consists of what is now Albasan is located along seashores while Madjanos located inland. Madjanos is grown into a township, when reached up to the west bank of Aklan River. It has its own church and trading post.\n\nSince the confederation has expanded to include Lusong, Buglas, Rorom, Sugbo and Mait, volumes of trades increased. Chinese, Indonesians and Malayan traders came to trade. When Balinganga, the son of Datu Bangkaya, was the Punuan of the Minuro it Aklan and at the same time the head of Madjaas Confederacy and shortly after the death of Datu Paiburong, Madjanos was again the seat of the whole government of Panay and consequently became the national capital of Pre-Hispanic Philippines.\n\nThe \"Minuro it Aklan\" became the clearing port of immigrants coming from other places. For more than fifty years Balinganga ruled the confederacy reminding his subject about the Code of Sumakwel. In the meanwhile, he followed the policy of his father throughout the Katilingban of Madjaas. From the death of Balinganga up to the arrival of Legaspi in 1570, several successors has ruled the province of Aklan and the seat of the government was transferred to different places due to demographic movement and the exigency of time.\n\nThe old site of Madjanos, which is quite neglected, was renamed \"Laguinbanwa\" meaning \"old town\" in 1620 to revive the former vitality of the community. The town of Laguinbanwa included the territories, which is now occupied by Lezo and Numancia. But as the community across the Aklan River became more prosperous, the seat of the town was transferred in 1785 to what is now Kalibo, and Lezo and Numancia became \"barrio\"s of Kalibo.\n\nAs the town of Kalibo grew in importance it has become the hub where people gathered for important celebrations and where other municipalities pay their tribute money or taxes. Every Sunday people faithfully attended mass in Kalibo since the priests make church attendance compulsory especially during fiestas and other religious holidays. Fearing hell and the ire of the church authorities, the people were docile followers of the priests and hence, they found it necessary to hear mass and made confessions for the absolutions of their sins.\n\nAt the time, however, there were no good roads, only trails and there were no strong bridges to span wide Aklan River. During the rainy season, it was difficult to cross the swollen river. In view of this, the residents of Laguinbanwa and Guicod petitioned to the bishop of Cebu and the Military governor of the Visayas to allow them to build their own church and to have a separate municipality explaining their problems and difficulties.\n\nAfter assessing the situation, the Bishop of Cebu and the military governor of the Visayas considered that the people of Laguinbanwa and Guicod are capable of providing tribute tax to run their own municipality informed the leaders of Laguinbanwa that they interpose no objection to their objection to separate from Kalibo. They requested that delegates should be sent to Kalibo were representatives of the bishop and the military governor will hear their cases.\n\nA delegation from Laguinbanwa headed by Silvino Kimpo met the representative of the bishop and the military governor of the Visayas in Kalibo where they talked about their petition. When they were asked where to place their town and where to build their church, they explained that the consensus of the people in Laguinbanwa, Madjanos, and Lauan and also Guicod was to put the Poblacion in what is now the site of Numancia being the center of these communities. Most of the members of the delegation of Tan Binong came from Madjanos and Laguinbanwa. So in 1856 Numancia was constituted as a municipality with Silvino Kimpo as the First Head of Kapitan Basal The appointment was approved by the Provincial Chief Executive and carried a term of two years.\n\nWhen the Americans came in 1899, the military government appointed Felix Kimpo as head of the town. During the election in 1901 he was elected as the president from 1901 to 1903. At that time there were 34 towns in the province of Capiz, but these were reduced to 24 towns by a law passed by the civil Commission when it was found out that some towns were incapable of meeting their financial obligations and maintenance. So on March 4, 1904, an executive order was passed fusing Banga, Lezo, Numancia, and Kalibo into one municipality.\n\nFive years after on July 31, 1909, the civil commission passed another law separation Lezo and Numancia from Kalibo and making Lezo as the seat of government. Numancia then, became a \"barrio\" of Lezo. In 1920 the situation was reversed with regards to the status of Lezo and Numancia. By \"Executive Order No. 17\", series of 1920, the seat of government was transferred to Numancia and Lezo became a \"barrio\" of Numancia.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Second World War, President Manuel L. Quezon issued \"Executive Order No. 364\" series of 1941 dated August 28, 1941 making Lezo a separate municipality from Numancia. The actual inauguration for the separation of Lezo from Numancia was deferred to January 1, 1945. On this date both Lezo and Numancia became separate municipalities.\n\nIn the , Numancia had a population of . The population density was .\n\nNumancia's tourist attractions include beach resort situated along coastline barangays like the Doña Crispina Beach Resort and Hotel and other existing Beach resorts in Barangay Navitas and in Barangay Camanci Norte and Nadal Castle in Laguinbanua West (Nadal Castle is already closed; Allegedly due to bankruptcy).\n\nNumancia is home to the lone seminary in Aklan. By reason of its proximity to Kalibo, only few schools were established in the town. The following are the major schools of the municipality:\n\n\n"}

It is related to elephants, sirenians, hyraxes and the extinct desmostylians. Arsinoitheres were superficially rhinoceros-like herbivores that lived during the late Eocene and the early Oligocene of northern Africa from 36 to 30 million years ago, in areas of tropical rainforest and at the margin of mangrove swamps. A species described in 2004, \"A. giganteum\", lived in Ethiopia about 27 million years ago.\n\nThe generic name \"Arsinoitherium\" comes from Pharaoh Arsinoe I, after whom the Faiyum Oasis, the region in which the fossils were found, was called during Ptolemaic Kingdom, and the \"theríon\" \"beast\". The species epithet of the type species, \"A. zitteli\", was given to it in honor of the eminent German paleontologist Karl Alfred Ritter von Zittel, regarded by some as the pioneer of paleontology in Egypt.\n\nThe best-known (and first-described) species is \"A. zitteli\". Another species, \"A. giganteum\", was discovered in the Ethiopian highlands of Chilga in 2003. The fossil teeth, far larger than those of \"A. zitteli\", date to around 28–27 million years ago. While the Fayum Oasis is the only site where complete skeletons of \"Arsinoitherium\" fossils were recovered, arsinoitheriids have been found in southeastern Europe, including \"Crivadiatherium\" from Romania, and \"Hypsamasia\" and \"Palaeoamasia\" from Turkey.\n\nWhen alive, they would have superficially resembled a rhinoceros. Adults of the species \"A. zitteli\" stood around tall at the shoulders and in length. The most noticeable features of \"Arsinoitherium\" were a pair of enormous horns above the nose (these horns most likely obscured the animal's forward vision) and a second pair of tiny knob-like horns over the eyes. Typically portrayed as similar to the ossicones of modern giraffes, they were structurally similar to the horns of modern bovids. The skeleton is robust and the limbs were columnar, similar to those of elephants; the hips were also elephant-like. \"Arsinoitherium\" had a full complement of 44 teeth, which is the primitive state of placental mammalian dentition, with characteristics suggesting that it was a selective browser.\nFossils of \"Arsinoitherium\" have been found in:\n\n\n"}

It was the Swiss contribution to the 2004 Venice Architecture Biennale and was awarded the Gold Medal in the category \"Most beautiful books of the World\" at the Leipzig Book Fair in 2005. It consists of a meticulous description of the transformation process, a narrative of its construction, and suggestions on the organizational workings on Globus Cassus.\n\nWaldvogel described it as an \"open source\" art project and stated that anyone could contribute designs and narratives to it on the project wiki. As of August 2012, the Globus Cassus wiki is no longer operational.\n\nThe proposed megastructure would incorporate all of Earth's matter. Sunlight would enter through two large windows, and gravity would be simulated by the centrifugal effect. Humans would live on two vast regions that face each other and that are connected through the empty center. The hydrosphere and atmosphere would be retained on its inside. The ecosphere would be restricted to the equatorial zones, while at the low-gravity tropic zones a thin atmosphere would allow only for plantations. The polar regions would have neither gravity nor atmosphere and would therefore be used for storage of raw materials and microgravity production processes.\n\nGlobus Cassus has the form of a compressed geodesic icosahedron with two diagonal openings. Along the edges of the icosahedron run the skeleton beams, the gaps between the beams contain a shell and, where there are windows, inward-curving domes.\n\nEarth's crust, mantle and core are gradually excavated, transported outwards and then transformed to larger strength and reduced density. While the crust is mined from open pits in the continents' centers, magma and the liquid mantle are pumped across transfer hoses. The core is dismantled from the surface.\n\nSince the stationary cables would stay clear inside the moon's trajectory, the construction of Globus Cassus would not alter the Earth-Moon system. However, on a planetary scale the proportions would be altered, with Globus Cassus being only slightly smaller than Saturn, the Solar System's second-largest planet.\n\nStarting at four precisely defined points in the geostationary orbit, four space elevators are built. Eventually they become massive towers, each measuring several hundred kilometers in diameter and extending to a length of about 165,000 km. The towers contain elevators which are used to transport silicate building material to the construction sites at geostationary orbit.\n\nThe building material is converted into vacuum-porous aggregate and used to form the skeleton. It is built retaining constant symmetry and balance at every moment and will ultimately span around all sides of the earth. Then magma is pumped towards the skeleton, where it is used to form thin shells in the skeletal openings. Eight of these openings are fitted with large, inward-curving window domes made out of silicon glass.\n\nHaving been used up to a large degree, the Earth has shrunk, the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth's mass and therefore gravity has declined. This leads to the sudden loss of the atmosphere and hydrosphere, which wander outwards towards the new World. Globus Cassus' equator zones are equipped with a system of trenches and moulds that will become rivers, lakes and seas as soon as the water has settled. The transfer process of atmosphere and hydrosphere is called \"The Great Rains\".\n\nThe moment the Great Rains start, the Earth becomes uninhabitable. Along with massive amounts of seed for all existing plants, the regions of high cultural value, that need to be conserved and reapplied on Globus Cassus have been stored in the skeleton nodes which touch the towers. Humans and animals rise in the towers to await the end of the rains and start settling on the two equator regions.\n\nThe remaining Earth core is dismantled to build the shells that lie in the pole regions. During this process, the massive heat radiation of the core accelerates plant growth and therefore aids the process of establishing a functioning biosphere.\n\n\n\"Globus Cassus\", Lars Müller Publishers, with contributions by Boris Groys, Claude Lichtenstein, Michael Stauffer and Christian Waldvogel.

Bird\n\nLloyd Campbell Bird (August 1, 1894 – April 20, 1978) was a pharmacist, businessman and Democratic politician who served as a Virginia State Senator for 28 years and helped found Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.\n\nHe was born in Highland County, Virginia to George Anson Bird and his wife Mary Susan Campbell. Bird graduated from the Medical College of Virginia in 1917. He married Mrs Lucille Crutchfield (1894-1970), and they had a son and daughter who survived them.\n\nAfter graduation, Bird began teaching at what is now the Medical College of Virginia. In 1925, he partnered with Morris Phipps to start Phipps & Bird, a business that provided laboratory apparatus, chemicals and other products for scientific education.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1953, he was the president of the Virginia Academy of Science, which in 1972 elected him as a \"Fellow\".\n\nA Democrat, Bird began his public career as a member of the Byrd Organization. Voters first elected him to the Virginia Senate in 1944, and he represented Charles City, Chesterfield, Henrico, James City, and New Kent counties as well as the city of Williamsburg. Bird replaced fellow Democrat Hunsden Cary, who resigned during the 1942 General Assembly, but the vacancy was not filled for the special session that fall. Despite multiple reorganizations of his senatorial district, Bird was continually re-elected (generally for four year terms) more than seven times. During his long tenure, redistricting occurred several times, both due to federal census results and court orders pursuant to the instructions of the United States Supreme Court concerning one-man, one-vote.\n\nIn 1955, a major reorganization of the Senate renumbered his district the 33rd, and limited it geographically to Charles City and Chesterfield counties, part of Henrico county and the city of Colonial Heights; the 34th district at that time was redrawn to include only the city of Richmond, and was represented by three state senators. Another reorganization in 1963 renumbered Bird's district the 32nd and it included Charles City, Chesterfield, James City and New Kent counties, as well as the cities of Colonial Heights and Williamsburg; the 33rd district was redrawn at that time to encompass Richmond City and the 34th district to include Henrico County. A further reorganization in 1965 renumbered Bird's district the 29th, and it included Charles City, Chesterfield, Amelia, New Kent Counties and the city of Colonial Heights. Bird retired after the massive Republican victories in the 1970 elections, and subsequent redistricting after the 1970 census split his district into three districts, each with a veteran Democratic senator whom he would thus have to defeat in the party's primary. Charles City and New Kent counties were added to the 4th senatorial district (which also included Gloucester, Goochland, Hanover, King and Queen, King William. Louisa, Mathews and Middlesex counties) which was represented by Leslie D. Campbell, Jr.; Chesterfield County was combined with Henrico County and Richmond City as the 11th senatorial district, which continued to be represented by Byrd Organization stalwart Frederick T. Gray and Colonial Heights was added to the 16th senatorial district (which included Prince George, Surry, Sussex counties and the cities of Hopewell and Petersburg) and represented by Elmon T. Gray. \n\nWhile many now regret Bird's involvement in Massive Resistance, as it ended pursuant to adverse court decisions and voter antipathy, Bird headed a legislative commission worked with fellow Byrd stalwart and Virginia Governor Mills E. Godwin as well as former Richmond mayor (turned member of the Virginia House of Delegates) Eleanor P. Sheppard to form Virginia Commonwealth University by merging his alma mater, the Medical College of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute.\n\nBird retired from the senate shortly after his wife's death, but lived an additional eight years before his own death and burial in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery. Survivors included his son (George C. Bird of Monterey, Virginia) and his daughter (Susan Blanchard of Richmond), as well as his step-daughter (Mrs. Charles Brown of Waukegan, Illinois).\n\nLloyd C. Bird High School in Chesterfield County, Virginia is named after him.\n\n"}

Bocca spent twenty years as a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre and is currently the artistic director of Ballet Nacional Sodre, the national ballet of Uruguay. \n\nBocca has been called one of the most popular Argentine dancers of all time.\n\nBorn in the Munro neighborhood of the Greater Buenos Aires, he started ballet lessons at the age of four, and at the age of seven entered the National School of Dance, progressing to the Teatro Colón's Advanced Arts Institute a year later. His mother was a dance teacher who encouraged his studies.\n\nBocca joined the Chamber Ballet Company at the Colón Theatre in 1981. A year later, he began performing as a soloist in a production directed by Danish choreographer Flemming Flindt. In 1985, aged 18, he won the gold medal at the International Ballet Competition in Moscow and was invited to join the American Ballet Theatre by Mikhail Baryshnikov, the youngest principal dancer ever hired. Although Bocca was a principal dancer, he was allowed to perform frequently as a guest artists with other companies. In 1987, he was named Dancer of the Year by the New York Times.\n\nAs a guest artist, Bocca has performed with companies such as La Scala in Milan, the Paris Opera, the Kirov of Saint Petersburg, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Cuban National Ballet and the National Ballet of Madrid, and the Bolshoi Ballet. A performance with the Royal Ballet in London prompted a reviewer with \"Dance Magazine\" to rave about \"his irresistible combination of passion and gallantry.\" \n\nBocca achieved extreme popularity in his native Argentina, frequently filling up soccer stadiums during his performances\n\nIn 1990 he created his own ballet company, the Ballet Argentino, which performs regularly in theatres around the globe. Bocca often collaborates with the Argentine dancer Eleonora Cassano. From 1997 to 2001 Bocca's dance partner with the Ballet Argentino was Luciana Paris.\nIn 2000 Julio Bocca participated in the international \"Millennium Day\" event, dancing in Ushuaia with Cassano and the Ballet Argentino in a performance broadcast to the whole world.\n\nJulio Bocca has also mixed ballet dancing with tango, a combination that has been very well received by the public. In 1998 he appeared in the film \"Tango, no me dejes nunca\" (English title: \"Tango\"), which gained him a new audience. In combining ballet with tango, he has often worked with the tango choreographer Ana Maria Stekelman. Bocca's repertoire with \"Ballet Argentino\" also includes contemporary, jazz, ballroom and modern styles of dancing.\n\nIn 2000, he appeared in Fosse, a Broadway musical showcasing the work of choreographer Bob Fosse.\n\nBocca danced his farewell performance with ballerina Alessandra Ferri in the American Ballet Theatre's production of \"Manon\" on June 22 and 23, 2006. He continued to perform with his \"Ballet Argentino\" until his retirement from dancing at the end of 2007.\n\nHis biography, \"Julio Bocca, La Vida en Danza\", by the French journalist Angeline Montoya, was published in Argentina in March 2007 by the Spanish publisher Aguilar.\n\nHe was named director of the Ballet Nacional SODRE by Uruguay's president José Mujica in March 2010. \n\nBocca served as a president of the jury at the Prix de Lausanne ballet competition in 2016.\n\nThe awards Julio Bocca has received include:\n\n"}

In contrast to white-space justification, which increases the length of a line of text by expanding spaces between words or individual letters, kasheeda creates justification by elongating characters at certain points. Kasheeda justification can be combined with white-space justification.\n\nThe analog in European (Latin-based) typography (expanding or contracting letters to improve spacing) is sometimes called \"expansion\", and falls within microtypography. Kasheeda is considerably easier and more flexible, however, because Arabic-Persian scripts feature prominent horizontal strokes, whose lengths are accordingly flexible.\n\nFor example, ' and ' with and without kasheeda may look like the following:\n\nKasheeda can also refer to a character that represents this elongation (ـ) – also known as tatweel or taṭwīl ( \"taṭwīl\") – or to one of a set of glyphs of varying lengths that implement this elongation in a font. The Unicode standard assigns code point U+0640 as \"Arabic Tatweel\".\nThe kasheeda can take a subtle downward curvature in some calligraphic styles and handwriting. However, the curvilinear stroke is not feasible for most basic fonts, which merely use a completely flat underscore-like stroke for kashida.\n\nIn addition to letter spacing and justification, calligraphers also use kasheeda for emphasis and as book or chapter titles.\nIn modern Arabic mathematical notation, kasheeda appears in some operation symbols that must stretch to accommodate associated contents above or below.\n\nKasheeda generally only appears in one word per line, and one letter per word. Furthermore, experts recommend kasheeda only between certain combinations of letters (typically those that cannot form a ligature). Some calligraphers who were paid by the page used an inordinate number of kasheeda to stretch contents over more pages.\n\nThe branding of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar applies kasheeda to Latin script, connecting the bottom of the \"t\" and the second \"a\" in the host country's name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050784", "title": "Maxwell Montes", "text": "Maxwell Montes\n\nMaxwell Montes is a mountain massif on the planet Venus, of which a peak (Skadi Mons) is the highest point on the planet's surface.\n\nLocated on Ishtar Terra, the more northern of the planet's two major highlands, Maxwell Montes is high. It rises about 6.4 kilometers above and to the east (21,000 ft above, and 4 miles to the east) of Lakshmi Planum, and is about long by wide. The western slopes are very steep, whereas the eastern slopes descend gradually into Fortuna Tessera. Due to its elevation it is the coolest (about ) and least pressurised (about ) location on the surface of Venus.\n\nThe origin of the Lakshmi Planum and the mountain belts such as Maxwell Montes is controversial. One theory suggests they formed over a hot plume of material rising from the interior of the planet, while another says the region is being compressed (pushed together) from all sides, resulting in material descending into the interior of the planet. The broad ridges and valleys making up Maxwell Montes and Fortuna Tessera suggest that the topography resulted from compression. The parallel ridges and valleys were cut by later extensional faults. The extreme height of Maxwell Montes in relation to other compressional mountain ranges around Lakshmi Planum suggests that its origin is more complex.\n\nMost of Maxwell Montes has a bright radar return which is common on Venus at high altitudes. This phenomenon is thought to result from the presence of a mineral, possibly a metallic snow. Early suggestions included pyrite and tellurium; more recently, lead sulfide and bismuth sulfide have been proposed.\n\nBy using radar to probe through the permanent and thick clouds in the Venusian atmosphere and make observations of the surface, scientists at the American Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico discovered the extensive highland on Venus that came to be called Maxwell Montes in 1967. In 1978, the space probe Pioneer Venus 1 went into orbit around Venus for the purpose of making radar observations of the Venusian surface. These observations made possible the creation of the first topographic map of the surface of Venus, and confirmed that a point within Maxwell Montes is the highest point above the average level of the planet's surface.\n\nMaxwell Montes is named for James Clerk Maxwell whose work in mathematical physics predicted the existence of radio waves, which made radar, and thus the surface observations of Venus, possible. Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio, and Beta Regio are the three exceptions to the rule that the surface features of Venus are to be named for females. The name, originally given by Ray Jurgens in 1970 on the urging of Tommy Gold, was approved by the International Astronomical Union's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) between 1976 and 1979.\n\n"}
{"id": "2050786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050786", "title": "Intraweb", "text": "Intraweb\n\nAn intraweb is a web comprising all HTTP nodes on an intranet; synonyms are corporate web, internal web.\n\nIntranets are networks used internally in organizations to facilitate communication and access to corporate information. Internet protocol suite and tools build intranets and especially the Web application layer to provide organisations with integrated and unified interfaces to corporate 'legacy' data and information systems.\n\nVery often the term intranet refers only to the most visible service i.e. the internal websites. In fact for a large portion, intranets are solely relying on World Wide Web software. More than just a play on the word 'Internet', the word intranet was formed from the prefix intra-, meaning \"inside, within\", plus net, an abbreviation of 'network'. Likewise, 'intraweb' is formed from the prefix intra- plus web and thus refers to web sites that are only accessible to people within a specific group, organization or community. Nowadays, most large companies have intrawebs as part of their internal information system.\n\nBeing built on the same technology, intranets can offer similar services within an organization to those provided by the Internet outside it but: (1) they are not necessarily connected to the Internet and (2) their services can tap into internal organisation resources.\nWith the advent of mobile computing, the notion of internal versus external network is no longer physical; intranets and extranets often make use of Virtual private networks (VPN). The main reason for the separation between intranets and the Internet is to preserve the confidentiality and security of the corporate information system. These mini-Internets are owned and managed by companies and enable these corporations to share their resources with their employees without confidential information being made available on the public Internet. Web sites running on an intranet look and act just like any other Web sites, but the firewall surrounding the intranet prevents any unauthorized access thus creating a private web.\nIn a B2B context a company might grant limited access to its intranet to other companies; this is known as an \"extranet\". Intranets, extranets and Internet are realms of security created for dedicated cooperation and ordered by openness. More generally, access restrictions are of three kinds: from the outside to the inside (through firewalls and VPN), from the inside to the inside (user profiles and access levels), from the inside to the outside (e.g. web filtering).\n\nMany companies maintain such mini private Webs that contain information only of use to their employees: organisational structure, corporate templates, Human resources forms, forms, directory, agendas, news, policies, rules, regulations, help files, project descriptions, expert annuary, partnerships with external companies, law information, etc. Intrawebs offer a safe place for employees to publish information that improves workflow but also online interfaces with corporate 'legacy' data, information systems and shared applications.\nIn fact intrawebs are becoming a privileged means for knowledge management to acquire, facilitate the access, share, and reuse knowledge in order to foster creation of new knowledge and organisational learning.\nAs they grow, many intrawebs need a search facility that allows users to find specific information more easily.\nFinally, we mentioned that intrawebs were used to limit access to the web (e.g. web filtering) but inversely they can be used to facilitate it. The organization which sets up an intranet is a community and may host many sub-communities of interest that can maintain collective directories, shared bookmark repositories, etc. Thus an intranet is not necessarily only an internal portal to internal resources, it can also provide efficient and focused portals to the world \"wide\" web.\n\nReliance on cheap or free software enabled Intranets to conquer corporate computing. Most internal networks use Internet protocols and therefore the same technology stack can be used above. Relying on technologies developed for the Internet, internal company networks benefit from widely used and supported techniques that are simple and inexpensive to build and maintain compared to proprietary solutions. The same concepts and technologies of the Internet, such as clients and servers running on the Internet protocol suite, build an intranet. In addition to an economy of scale in terms of building, deployment and maintenance costs, one can also recognize an economy of scale in terms of cognitive workload: reusing the same technologies and tools as the World Wide Web to build an organization-wide web of internal documents makes it familiar and easier both for developers and users. The same server technologies distribute information, the same browser clients are used to access it, corporate information and application present the same uniform hypertext interface.\n\nHistorically, many evolutions of the world wide web have been adopted and used in internal webs. Just like the web evolved from a text-based system to a web of multimedia and online services, intrawebs now include multimedia resources and, for instance, corporate forms moved from online static copies to dynamic front-ends of web applications directly linked to the corporate information system. Even latest web tools meet application scenarios on corporate webs: wikis can be used to edit and maintain corporate documents and directories in a very simple way, blogs can be used for news and technological watch, web services are being used to allow enterprise application integration and workflow management, semantic web frameworks are used for information and data integration and exchanges for instance to materialize corporate memories as corporate semantic webs, etc.\nIntrawebs are webs dedicated to the community of a corporation. Being on a private network of the company, intrawebs can include a whole family of applications that could not be made available on the public web for confidentiality reasons: corporate applications. The corporation is an existing community that needs to set up and maintain collaboration to attain professional objectives. Web technologies propose shared application supporting communities of practice, of interest, and more generally speaking, knowledge management. They can support collaborations: synchronous communication, expert matching, internal FAQ, collaborative document edition, case-based memories, project management, workflows, etc. Within a company the existence of such community and of its shared professional interests makes the intraweb a selected place to develop and experiment new web-based solutions.\nHistorically there has always been a synergy between World Wide Web evolutions and intra-webs experiments. Many evolutions of the World Wide Web have been adopted and used in internal webs and, vice versa, many local initiatives on intrawebs turned out to be seeds of new web applications.\n\nThis word has also been adapted into a slang term used by gamers and forum users. However, by their sense of the word it is used to mean the public World Wide Web.\n\n"}

It has been brought into other mild northern climates for forage or erosion control, but is often considered a weed.\n\nOther names include common couch, twitch, quick grass, quitch grass (also just quitch), dog grass, quackgrass, scutch grass, and witchgrass.\n\nIt has creeping rhizomes which enable it to grow rapidly across grassland. It has flat, hairy leaves with upright flower spikes. The stems ('culms') grow to 40–150 cm tall; the leaves are linear, 15–40 cm long and 3–10 mm broad at the base of the plant, with leaves higher on the stems 2–8.5 mm broad. The flower spike is 10–30 cm long, with spikelets 1–2 cm long, 5–7 mm broad and 3 mm thick with three to eight florets. The glumes are 7–12 mm long, usually without an awn or with only a short one.\n\nIt flowers at the end of June through to August in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nVarious taxonomic subdivisions of this species have been proposed. Moreover, it is assigned to various genera (\"Elymus\", \"Elytrigium\", \"Agropyron\"). In a recent classification, three subspecies are distinguished, one of these with an additional variety:\n\nHybrids are recorded with several related grasses, including \"Elytrigia juncea\" (\"Elytrigia × laxa\" (Fr.) Kerguélen), \"Elytrigia atherica\" (\"Elytrigia × drucei\" Stace), and with the barley species \"Hordeum secalinum\" (\"× Elytrordeum langei\" (K. Richt.) Hyl.).\n\nThe foliage is an important forage grass for many grazing mammals. The seeds are eaten by several species of grassland birds, particularly buntings and finches. The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera use it as a foodplant, e.g. the Essex skipper (\"Thymelicus lineola\").\n\nCouch grass has become naturalised throughout much of the world, and is often listed as an invasive weed. It is very difficult to remove from garden environments, as the thin rhizomes become entangled among the roots of shrubs and perennials, and each severed piece of rhizome can develop into a new plant. It may be possible to loosen the earth around the plant, and carefully pull out the complete rhizome. \nThis is best done in the spring, when disturbed plants can recover. Another method is to dig deep into the ground in order to remove as much of the grass as possible. The area should then be covered with a thick layer of woodchips. To further prevent re-growth, cardboard can be placed underneath the woodchips. The long, white rhizomes will, however, dry out and die if left on the surface. Many herbicides will also control it.\n\nThe dried rhizomes of couch grass were broken up and used as incense in medieval northern Europe where other resin-based types of incense were unavailable. \"Elymus repens\" (\"Agropyron repens\") rhizomes have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine against fever, internally as a tea, syrup, or cold maceration in water, or externally applied as a crude drug.\n\n"}

It is situated on the border with Songkhla province, Thailand, 35 kilometers northeast of Kangar and about 57 km southwest of Hat Yai. The town opposite Padang Besar in Thailand is also known as Padang Besar, although locals here usually refer to the town as \"Pekan Siam\" or Siamese town.\nThe town is a \"shopping heaven\" and popular destination for Malaysians because of the duty-free shopping complex in between the border checkpoints of the two countries. The town attracts several thousand visitors from Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand every weekend and during public holidays.\n\nPadang Besar is connected to Malaysia Federal Route and railway which lead to the border crossing into Thailand. The road and railway respectively connect directly to Padang Besar – Sadao Highway (Thailand Route 4054) and State Railway of Thailand to form part of the Trans-Asian Railway.\n\nThe Malaysian checkpoint is located to the north east of town, about 300m from the actual border where the Thai checkpoint is located. Both the Malaysian and Thai checkpoints have drive-through lanes\n\nThe Padang Besar railway station has Malaysia's only co-located or juxtaposed customs, immigration and quarantine facility for both Malaysia and Thailand and rail passengers are processed for exiting Malaysia and entering Thailand (or vice versa if traveling the other direction) in the station. The Padang Besar station in Thailand only serves as a domestic station.\n\nIn the 1970s, both Malaysia and Thailand constructed walls along their common border, mostly in Perlis/Satun and Perlis/Songkhla as well as Kedah/Songkhla portions of the border to curb smuggling. The walls were of concrete and steel and were topped with barbed wire as well as iron fencing at other stretches. As both countries constructed their own walls a little into their own territory, a strip of \"no-man's-land\" about 10m wide was created and this strip of land became a convenient refuge for smugglers (not all smuggling was deterred by the wall) and drug runners.\n\nIn 2001, the two countries agreed to construct just one wall along the border which would be located just inside Thai territory. The new border wall is 2.5m high and made up of a concrete lower half and steel fencing on the upper half. At the base, barbed wire runs along the length of the wall.\n\nWhile the stated reason for the construction of the wall has been to curb smuggling and encroachment, security reasons - earlier in the 1970s and 1980s resulting from Malaysian communist groups and groups involved in the South Thailand insurgency in the late 1990s and early 2000s - have also been a major push for the barrier to be constructed.\n\nThe history of Padang Besar is shown below:\n\nTourism, international trading and the logistics sector are the most important profit source to local citizens if compared to agriculture.

It is the capital of the Paita Province which is in the Piura Region. It is a leading seaport in that region. It is located 1,089 km northwest of the country's capital Lima and 57 km northwest of the regional capital of Piura.\nStarting in 2014, it has entertained ideas for the separation Paita from Piura Region, proclaiming itself \"Miguel Grau region\".\n\nThe seaport city Paita is located at on a small peninsula south of the mouth of the Río Chira on an area of 1,785 km². \n<br>\nPaita faces on the \"Bay of Paita\", and is sheltered from southerly winds by a headland called \"Punta Paita\" and by a large hill called \"Silla de Paita\".\n<br>\n90 km to the south east is the capital of the Piura Region, Piura, and 160 km to the south is located Chiclayo, commercial centre of the Lambayeque region.\n\nThe population of the seaport Paita was 3,800 in 1906, 20 000 in 1993, 122 127 in 2007 and 168 900 in 2015\n\nPaleontologist Edgar Herning (1960) collected remains in 1978 considering this a highly evolved cultural group, reporting that 9000 years ago there were primitive villages of the coast of Paita like Colan, Tayta and Amotape.\n\nFrom 1578 to 1588, Paita was the Spanish capital of the northwestern Peruvian coast, before the permanent attacks of English pirates and corsairs made it necessary to relocate the capital at Piura.\n\nThe port of Paita is best known to many Peruvians as the former home of Manuela Sáenz, Simón Bolívar's lover.\n\nPaita was a significant port of call for whaling ships in the first half of the 19th century. The whaling grounds west of Peru were popular with British and American whaling ships and they often called at Paita for supplies and repairs. Local men were sometimes recruited to serve as crewmen on these vessels. The first vessel known to have called was the British whaler \"Emilia\" in 1792. Sixty-four American whalers visited in 1833 alone. So many American vessels called that in 1833 the United States government decided to establish a consulate at Paita. A hospital was established for sick or injured American seaman in the 1840s. The large protected Bay of Paita provided a safe anchorage for visiting vessels and the irrigated farms of the nearby Chira valley produced a wide range of agricultural produce for the whalers. The money they injected into the local economy provided substantial economic benefit to the town and hinterland and this continued till American whaling visits began to taper off in the 1860s.\n\nIn 1875, a railway line of 97 km length was completed from Piura to Paita, but it was destroyed in the war with Chile from 1879 to 1883 and reconstructed in 1884. A street railway opened on 30 August 1891 and ran until the late 1920s.\n\nToday the port of Paita is Peru's fifth largest port and an important container port. It is located in a geopolitically important position on the Pacific coast.\n\nPaita has one of the best natural harbours of the Peruvian coast and runs regular mail steamers between Valparaíso and Panama.\n\nOn 24 September the is celebrated, lasting a week and including pilgrimages in honor of the catholic iconic image.\n\n\n\"The Golden Ocean\" by Patrick O'Brian, first published in 1954 then again in 1996, mentions the successful attack of Anson's squadron at Paita in his voyage around the world, taking a prize of merchant's gold, silver and trade goods, valued at 30,000 British pounds.\n\nIn the 1947 film \"Dark Passage\", Humphrey Bogart's character, falsely blamed for three murders, flees to Paita, with hopes of linking up with love interest. He tells her of \"a little cafe right on the bay\". Parts of the telephone conversation are used in the 1982 film \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\".\n\n"}

The average temperature in the city lies around , and precipitation is low.\n\nThe area was originally occupied by indigenous people, who used it as a settlement and for fishing purposes. The natural harbour in Coquimbo was taken over by Pedro de Valdivia from Spain in 1550. The gold and copper industry in the region led to the city's importance as a port around 1840 and many Europeans especially from England settled in Coquimbo. In 1879 it was recognised as a town.\n\nThe city was on the main path of totality of the Solar eclipse of July 2, 2019.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Coquimbo had 163,036 inhabitants (79,428 men and 83,608 women).

Governor Dale is best remembered for the energy and the extreme rigour of his administration in Virginia, which established order and in various ways seems to have benefited the colony, although he was criticised for high-handedness. He is also credited with the establishment of Bermuda Hundred, Bermuda Cittie, and the Cittie of Henricus.\n\nFrom about 1588 to 1609, Thomas Dale was in the service of the Low Countries (the Netherlands and parts of modern Belgium) with the English army originally under Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Because of his ability and ambition, he became friends with many people in positions of authority. In 1599 Thomas Dale was recruited by the Earl of Essex for England's army, and was knighted by King James to become \"Sir Thomas Dale of Surry\" on 16 June 1606.\n\nWhile Dale was still serving in the Low Countries, on the recommendation of the eldest son of King James, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the States-General of the United Netherlands consented \"that Captain Thomas Dale (destined by the King of Great Britain to be employed in Virginia in his Majesty's service) may absent himself from his company for the space of three years, and that his said company shall remain meanwhile vacant, to be resumed by him if he think proper.\"\n\nFive years later, the Virginia Company of London sent Sir Thomas Dale to act as deputy-governor or as \"Marshall of Virginia\" (a new position) for the Virginia Colony under the authority of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (Lord Delaware). Sent with three ships, on 19 May 1611, he arrived at Jamestown (named after King James) with men, cattle, and provisions. he found the conditions unhealthy and greatly in need of improvement. Dale immediately called for a meeting of the Jamestown Council, and established crews to rebuild Jamestown.\n\nHe served as acting Governor for 3½ months in 1611, and again for a two-year period between 1614 and 1616. In the interim, he served as the Marshall of the colony, initially serving directly under Deputy Governor Sir Thomas Gates. Effectively, for five years, he was the highest ranking law enforcement officer in Virginia. He exhibited a certain stern efficiency which was perhaps the best support and medicine that could have been devised. It was during his administration that the first code of laws of Virginia, nominally in force from 1611 to 1619, was effectively tested. This code, entitled \"Articles, Lawes, and Orders Divine, Politique, and Martiall\" (popularly known as Dale's Code), was notable for its pitiless severity, and seems to have been prepared in large part by Dale himself.\n\nPerhaps Dale's most lasting reform was economic. In 1613, without stockholder consent, Dale abandoned the communal agriculture which had proved unsatisfactory and assigned 3-acre (12,000 m2) plots to its \"ancient planters\" and smaller plots to the settlement's later arrivals. Measurable economic progress was made, and the settlers began expanding their planting to land belonging to local native tribes. Not only did food production increase markedly, but the following year John Rolfe succeeded on his plot in raising the first hybrid tobacco: the key to the colony's future.\n\nSeeking a better site than Jamestown, Thomas Dale sailed up the James River (also named after King James) to the area now known as Chesterfield County. \nHe was apparently impressed with the possibilities of the general area where the Appomattox River joins the James River, and there are published references to the name \"New Bermuda\" although it apparently was never formalised. (Far from the mainland of North America, the archipelago of Bermuda had been established as part of the Virginia Colony in 1612 following the shipwreck of the \"Sea Venture\" in 1609).\n\nA short distance further up the James, in 1611, he began the construction of a progressive development at Henricus on and about what was later known as Farrars Island. Henricus was envisioned as possible replacement capital for Jamestown, and was to have the first college in Virginia. (The ill-fated Henricus was destroyed during the Indian Massacre of 1622, during which a third of the colonists were killed). In addition to creating the new settlement at Henricus, Dale also established the port town of Bermuda Hundred and \"Bermuda Cittie\" (sic). He began the excavation work at Dutch Gap, using methods he had learned while serving in Holland.\n\nIn 1614, Governor Thomas Dale sent 20 men, under Lieutenant William Craddock, to the area across the Chesapeake Bay from mainland Virginia now known as the Eastern Shore to establish a salt works and to catch fish for the colonists. They intended to make salt by boiling down the sea water. They settled along Old Plantation Creek at a place named \"Dale's Gift\" on the mainland, but established the salt works on Smith Island, which is located adjacent to the southern portion of the Eastern Shore in present-day Northampton County near Cape Charles. \n\nGovernor Dale sailed back to England in the spring of 1616 aboard the \"Treasurer\". Accompanying him on what was considered an investor-relations journey were John Rolfe, his wife Rebecca (Pocahontas) and their one-year-old son, Thomas Rolfe. Samuel Argall commanded that ship. Queen Anne and others were reportedly charmed by Rebecca, and investment in the Virginia Company was enhanced. However, soon after leaving London, as John Rolfe and his wife sailed down the Thames River, Rebecca became very ill and died on 21 March 1617 before returning to Virginia.\n\nIn 1618 Dale was appointed commander of a squadron of six ships, which the East India Company sent out in April, to maintain their interests against the aggressive policy of the Dutch and for the relief of Nathaniel Courthope who was reportedly beleaguered on the island of Run. Dale arrived at Bantam in November 1618, and on 23 December engaged the Dutch fleet off Jacatra (now Jakarta). After a sharp action he put it to flight, and laid siege to the Dutch fort at Jacatra, in the swamps around which he seems to have contracted the sickness of which, in the course of the following summer, he died at Masulipatnam in India.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2050845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050845", "title": "Japanese cruiser Ōyodo", "text": "Japanese cruiser Ōyodo\n\nThe ship reverted to her previous roles when the headquarters of the Combined Fleet was moved ashore in September. The following month, she participated in the Battle off Cape Engaño, where she escorted the Japanese carriers attempting to decoy the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches. Afterwards, the ship was transferred to Southeast Asia and engaged American forces in the Philippines in December where she was slightly damaged by American bombers. In early 1945, \"Ōyodo\" participated in Operation Kita, during which she transported aviation gasoline and other strategic materials back to Japan. The ship was damaged by American carrier aircraft in March and repairs were completed two months later. She was sunk with the loss of about 300 men during American airstrikes in July. After the war, \"Ōyodo\" was salvaged and scrapped in 1947–1948.\n\nThe IJN's concept of submarine warfare was to use long-range submarines in squadrons (\"sentai\") to attack enemy units at extended ranges. These submarines would be coordinated by a cruiser, which would use reconnaissance aircraft to provide targeting information. Originally, it was intended that the s would be able to serve in this role, but proved unsatisfactory. By the late 1930s, the Japanese Navy had defined the need for seven cruisers to support its seven submarine squadrons. Funding for the first two vessels was approved under the 1939 4th Replenishment Program, of which only one, \"Ōyodo\", was begun. Construction of the second ship, intended to be named \"Niyodo\", was suspended on 6 November 1941 because \"Ōyodo\" still occupied her intended slipway and was finally cancelled on 3 August 1942.\n\n\"Ōyodo\"s design was derived from that of the \"Agano\"s. \"Ōyodo\" retained the same general hull design with a flush deck and bulbous bow, but her superstructure and armament differed to suit her different role. \"Ōyodo\" had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced and had a metacentric height of at deep load. Her crew numbered 33 officers and 532 enlisted men as completed.\n\n\"Ōyodo\" was powered by four geared steam turbine sets, each driving a single three-bladed propeller, using steam provided by six Kampon water-tube boilers that operated at a pressure of and a temperature of . The turbines were designed to produce for a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed during her sea trials reaching from . She stowed of fuel oil, which gave her a range of at . \"Ōyodo\" had three turbo generators of capacity and two diesel generators.\n\nThe ship's main battery comprised six 50-caliber 155 mm (6.1 in) 3rd Year Type guns in two triple-gun turrets superfiring forward of the superstructure. The gun was originally developed as a dual-purpose (anti-surface and anti-aircraft) weapon for the ; when they had their triple 155 mm turrets replaced with twin 203 mm (8 in) turrets, the now-surplus turrets were mounted on \"Ōyodo\" (as well as the s). Their slow rate of fire of 5 rounds per minute and limited elevation (up to only 55 degrees) made them unsuitable for the anti-aircraft role. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of at +45 degrees of elevation. Each gun was provided with 150 rounds. \n\n\"Ōyodo\"s heavy anti-aircraft battery consisted of eight 65-caliber 100 mm (3.9 in) Type 98 dual-purpose guns in four twin mounts. The mounts had a range of elevation from -10 degrees to +90 degrees and the guns had a muzzle velocity of with their projectiles. They had a range of and a height of at maximum elevation. The anti-aircraft armament was completed by eighteen 60-caliber Type 96 light AA guns in six triple mounts. Firing shells at a muzzle velocity of . These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.\n\nThe ship was equipped with a director-control tower above the bridge with a Type 94 gunnery director controlling the main armament. The director was fitted with a rangefinder and the upper gun turret mounted a rangefinder. The Type 98 10 cm guns were controlled by a pair of Type 94 directors positioned at the base of the bridge and the light AA guns were provided with three Type 95 directors, all on the forward superstructure.\n\nLike the heavy cruisers, the \"Ōyodo\"-class ships were intended to be scouting cruisers and hence the entire deck of the ship aft of the superstructure was devoted to aircraft facilities. The weight saved by not fitting torpedo tubes was invested instead in a hangar that could house four floatplanes, with two more stowed on deck, and a heavy-duty catapult that was necessary for the new Kawanishi E15K \"Shiun\" floatplane (Allied reporting name \"Norm\") that was intended to perform reconnaissance for the submarine flotilla in areas where the enemy had air superiority. To achieve this, the plane was designed with two retractable underwing stabilizing floats and a large central float that could be jettisoned to increase speed. However, the aircraft performed poorly and only fifteen were completed before it was canceled in February 1944. \"Ōyodo\" did carry two or three Aichi E13A \"Jake\" reconnaissance floatplanes during her career.\n\nThe ship's armor was designed to protect against 155 mm shells and bombs dropped from an altitude of . It had a waterline belt had a maximum thickness of of copper alloy homogeneous armor that protected the propulsion machinery and the bomb magazine; it extended above the waterline and below. The armored deck rested on the upper edge of the belt armor and was thick except over the bomb magazine where it increased to . The ends of the belt armor were closed off by transverse bulkheads that also increased to 50 mm adjacent to the bomb magazine. The magazine itself had 35 mm sides and a 25 mm front. The steering gear aft was protected by an armored box with sides, a front and a 25 mm rear. \n\nForward of the boiler rooms, the fire-control center, the 25 mm and 155 mm magazines had armored sides. The latter magazine had plates that tapered to 40 mm at their lower edge. The armor on the other compartments was 60 mm thick reducing to 30 mm at the bottom. The roof of these spaces was 50 mm thick over the 155 mm magazines and reduced to 28 mm over the other compartments. The main gun turrets were protected by 25 mm homogeneous armor plates and their barbettes had 20 mm or 25 mm thick plates. The sides of the conning tower were 40 mm thick and it had a roof 20 mm thick.\n\nFollowing the Japanese ship-naming conventions for light cruisers, the ship was named after the Ōyodo River in Kyūshū. \"Ōyodo\" was laid down at Kure Naval Arsenal on 14 February 1941, launched on 2 April 1942 and completed on 28 February 1943 under the command of Captain Sadatoshi Tomioka. Completed without any radar, a Type 21 early-warning radar was installed in April 1943 while the ship was still working up. \nThe war had developed in ways unanticipated by the IJN and her designed role as a submarine flotilla flagship was no longer possible or even appropriate, so the navy settled on using her as an ordinary light cruiser or as a transport. On 1 April, she was assigned to the Third Fleet and was transferred to the Main Body, Mobile Force, a month later. In response to the invasion of Attu Island on 11 May, \"Ōyodo\" rendezvoused with three battleships, two aircraft carriers and five heavy cruisers in Tokyo Bay on 22 May. The Americans recaptured Attu before the fleet could depart to counterattack. The following month the ship received a brief refit in Kure.\n\nShe loaded troops and supplies on 9 July at Shinagawa and, arrived at Truk, Caroline Islands, on 15 July before continuing on to Rabaul where she arrived on the 21st, returning to Truk five days later and rejoining the Third Fleet. In response to the carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September, much of the fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, \"Ōyodo\" and the bulk of the fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk.\n\nVice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, commander of the Third Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 6 December. On 30 December \"Ōyodo\" participated in an operation to reinforce the garrisons at Rabaul and Kavieng. While returning to Truk on 1 January 1944, \"Ōyodo\" was slightly damaged by US aircraft from two aircraft carriers of Task Group 50.2, with two crewmen killed and six wounded. The following day, she rescued 71 survivors from the transport \"Kiyosumi Maru\", which had been torpedoed by an American submarine. \"Ōyodo\" returned to Yokosuka on 16 February following the successful American invasion of Kwajalein, and loaded torpedoes and supplies for the Japanese garrison at Saipan, which were delivered on 22 February.\n\nOn 6 March, \"Ōyodo\" went into the dry dock at Yokosuka for a refit to convert her into a flagship, in which her hangar was converted into staff offices and accommodations to take advantage of her elaborate communications suite. The aircraft catapult was exchanged for the shorter () standard type, and a pair of Type 22 surface search radars were installed. 29 additional Type 96 guns were installed in six triple and eleven single mounts for a total of 47 weapons. The modifications increased her complement to 61 officers and 850 sailors. The day after the refit was finished on 31 March, \"Ōyodo\" became the flagship of the Combined Fleet. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, commander of the Combined Fleet, hoisted his flag on her on 4 May. \"Ōyodo\" remained in Japanese waters until 11 October. On 29 September, Admiral Toyoda and his staff transferred to the new underground headquarters of the IJN in Yokohama. Six additional Type 96 AA guns in single mounts were installed in early October, along with a Type 13 radar, and her Type 22 radars were modified to allow them to be used for fire control.\n\n\"Ōyodo\" rejoined the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet, commanded by Ozawa, on 5 October and departed Yokosuka on 11 October. En route, she was attacked by the submarine which fired six torpedoes, all of which missed. The ship departed Yashima anchorage on 20 October 1944 towards the Philippines as part of Operation \"Sho-Ichi-Go\"— which was intended to defeat the American invasion of the Philippines. \"Ōyodo\" was part of Ozawa's Northern Mobile (\"Decoy\") Force, which was to bait the American aircraft carrier strike force away from the main Japanese strike force by exposing the surviving Japanese carriers. \"Ōyodo\" was the only warship in Ozawa's force that had reconnaissance floatplanes, and both E13A1's performed reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols over the fleet. On the morning of 24 October, the bulk of the few aircraft aboard the carriers were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction. They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked. The Americans finally spotted Ozawa's ships at 16:40, some east of Cape Engaño, the northeastern tip of Luzon. The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an airstrike, so Admiral William Halsey, commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning. Ozawa reversed course during the night, correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north.\n\nAlthough they had lost contact during the night, the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07:35. They had already launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft that was orbiting ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located. This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day. During the first strike, \"Ōyodo\" suffered two near-misses, but at 08:48 she was hit by a bomb that damaged a boiler room. At 10:54, Vice Admiral Ozawa left the sinking aircraft carrier and transferred his flag to \"Ōyodo\". Later in the day the ship was hit by two rockets from F6F Hellcat fighter-bombers and damaged by another near-miss and Ozawa ordered his remaining forces to retire northward. Around 19:00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that sank the light carrier and drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day. He ordered the two hybrid battleship/carriers and \"Ōyodo\" to reverse course and engage the Americans, but they were unable to find them, and they reversed course at 23:30 and headed for Amami Ōshima. When they arrived there on the 27th Ozawa transferred his flag to the battleship \n\nA few days later \"Ōyodo\" was sent to Manila on a transport run, arriving on 1 November. Three days later she departed for Brunei and remained in the South China Sea area for the next several months. On 24 December \"Ōyodo\", the heavy cruiser and six destroyers sortied to attack the American forces at San Jose on the island of Mindoro. They were spotted by American aircraft late the next day and \"Ōyodo\" was hit by a pair of bombs; one failed to detonate and the other only slightly damaged the cruiser. The destroyers engaged an American convoy escorted by PT boats while the cruisers fired star shells to illuminate the area. They later bombarded a supply dump and set it on fire before returning to Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina.\n\n\"Ōyodo\" arrived in Singapore on 1 January 1945 and was repaired from 9 to 29 January. The following month she was assigned to Operation Kita together with the two \"Ise\"-class battleship/carriers and three destroyers. The ships were loaded with critically needed strategic war supplies (aviation gasoline, rubber, tin, zinc, and mercury) and 1,150 surplus oil workers to be ferried back to Japan. The ships sailed from Singapore on 10 February and was spotted by the British submarine the following day. \"Tantalus\" was forced to submerge by a maritime patrol aircraft and was unable to attack. On 13 February the submarine unsuccessfully attacked the ships as did the submarine . Later that afternoon, \"Ōyodo\" launched one of her floatplanes which spotted the submarine on the surface ahead of the convoy. \"Hyūga\" opened fire with her main guns and forced \"Bashaw\" to submerge when one of her shells landed within of the submarine. The convoy reached the Matsu Islands, off the Chinese coast, on the 15th and was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before they reached Zhoushan Island, near Shanghai, that night. The convoy reached Kure on 20 February, having evaded or escaped pursuit by twenty-three Allied submarines along the way.\n\n\"Ōyodo\" was transferred to the Kure Training Force on 1 March, and, a few weeks later, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Task Force 58 made the first carrier attack on Kure on 19 March. Three 500 lb bombs hit \"Ōyodo\"; one hit the port engine room and started fires that badly damaged the propulsion machinery compartments. Another hit the base of the funnel and destroyed the boiler uptakes and the last one detonated inside the ship. Near-misses ruptured some hull plating forward and the cruiser started to flood, but she was towed to Etajima and beached to prevent her from sinking. The bombs killed or wounded 54 crewmen. She was refloated and entered a dry dock for repairs on 23 March which were completed on 4 May.\nOn 24 July US Task Force 38 launched a massive attack to destroy any and all remaining units of the Japanese Navy. \"Ōyodo\" was strafed and hit by five bombs, two of which hit near her catapult and punched holes in her deck. Two more hit amidships near the engine rooms and the last struck forward of the bridge and started a fire that could not be extinguished for two days. Four days later, a day-long attack was launched by the US carrier fleet. \"Ōyodo\" was near-missed by bombs in the morning and the shock waves from their detonations ruptured her hull plating abreast of the forward engine room and No. 5 boiler room that flooded those two compartments. The asymmetric weight of the water on the starboard side caused her to capsized to starboard in shallow water about 25 minutes later. Permission to abandon ship was granted by Captain Shoichi Taguchi before she capsized, but about 300 crewmen were killed.\n\n\"Ōyodo\" was removed from the navy list on 20 November. Her wreck was raised on 20 September 1947 and towed to a dry dock to be demolished. The ship was scrapped from 6 January to 1 August 1948.\n\n"}

At that time it was common for computer magazines to publish games listings which readers could type into their own computer, and \"Air Attack\" was also published as a listing in the December 1979 issue of Personal Computer World.\n\nFor a short period a 4-coloured transparent overlay was available which simulated colour on the black-and-white screen of the PET computer (a similar technique had previously been used in some arcade machines, notably Breakout). However, when Commodore switched from black-and-white to green screens the effect was no longer as convincing, and the overlay was discontinued.\n\nAlthough the game was prompted by a verbal description of the arcade game \"Canyon Bomber\" (Atari, 1977), it was not until many years later that Peter Calver saw the original game. The inspired change from a canyon filled with rock pillars to a city of skyscrapers was copied by all later clones including \"Blitz\", \"City Bomber\" and \"City Lander\" (for ZX Spectrum, C64 and ZX-81).

Of great significance to the Britain's war effort, at its peak of production it employed around 40,000 people — said to be the largest ever factory in Britain's history.\n\nAt the end of World War I, much of Britain's armaments manufacturing capacity was run down, as its capacity was no longer needed. In the period leading up to World War II, consideration was given to Britain's war capability. As shown in the Spanish Civil War, the Luftwaffe were more than capable of accurately bombing many of Britain's key installations, which were also undersized to meet forecast required volumes.\n\nIn 1935, it was therefore agreed to keep armaments research at the Woolwich Arsenal in south-east London, while production would be transferred to two new factories at ROF Chorley in Lancashire (Filling Factory No.1) and ROF Bridgend in Glamorgan (Filling Factory No.2). As war planning progressed, it would be realised that this plan was flawed in both sustainability and capacity, and additional facilities would have to be built. Staff from the Royal Arsenal helped design and, in some cases, managed the construction of many of the new Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) and ROF Filling Factories. Just over 40 ROFs were opened by the end of World War II, nearly half of them Filling Factories, together with a similar number of factories built and run by private companies, such as ICI's Nobel Explosives (although these explosive factories were not called ROFs).\n\nBridgend was chosen for three main reasons:\n\nIn April 1936, of land in Waterton was compulsorily purchased. The site chosen was farmland next to the Great Western Railway South Wales Main Line, which offered additional benefits. Located on what was a reclaimed marshland, a persistent local legend has it that the resultant dampness often resulted in the area being covered in a light mist or fog, which further protected it from bombing. Even if so, the drainage of the marshes caused the mist to cease. Further acreage was purchased in Brackla, leading to the development of ROF 11 and ROF 41.\n\nIn April 1937, the Great Western Railway began constructing the of internal railway needed to supply the sites. This included a marshalling yard at the main site, sidings at Brackla Ridge, and the construction of Tremains halt near Waterton for worker access. A footbridge was also constructed here, the remnants of which can be seen today. Gee Walker & Slater Ltd, and Sir Lindsay Parkinson & Co. Ltd were the contractors awarded the project to build ROF 53. Sir Robert McAlpine won the contract to build ROF 11 and ROF 41, and the magazine tunnels. In all, the complex consisted of over 1000 buildings, serviced by of roads.\n\nBy 1940, the sites were in full production, with nearly 40,000 people working at the factory, the largest single-site employer in the country.\n\nROF Bridgend stopped production in 1945, having been designated a \"War Duration Only\" ROF. It remained open as a store until it was closed in 1946, when it was broken up and sold to property developers.\n\nMany of the specialised buildings were simply bulldozed, and like many of the former ROFs it became an industrial estate, now designated as Bridgend Industrial Estate. The administration buildings were taken over after the war to become the Glamorgan County Police Headquarters, which are now the South Wales Police headquarters.\n\nThe land between the two former facilities to the south of Brackla Hill, was developed as a large housing complex, now simply called Brackla.\n\n\n"}

The word derives from the Latin \"adstringere\", which means \"to bind fast\". Calamine lotion, witch hazel, and yerba mansa, a Californian plant, are astringents.\n\nAstringency, the dry, puckering mouthfeel caused by the tannins in unripe fruits, lets the fruit mature by deterring eating. Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), \"Aronia\" chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent. Tannins, being a kind of polyphenol, bind salivary proteins and make them precipitate and aggregate, producing a rough, \"sandpapery\", or dry sensation in the mouth. The tannins in some teas and red grape wines like Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot produce mild astringency.\n\nIn medicine, astringents cause constriction or contraction of mucous membranes and exposed tissues and are often used internally to reduce discharge of blood serum and mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin. People with acne are often advised to use astringents if they have oily skin. Mild astringents relieve such minor skin irritations as those resulting from superficial cuts; allergies; insect bites; anal hemorrhoids; and fungal infections such as athlete's foot.\n\nSome common astringents are alum, acacia, sage, yarrow, witch hazel, bayberry, distilled vinegar, very cold water, and rubbing alcohol. Astringent preparations include silver nitrate, potassium permanganate, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, Burow's solution, tincture of benzoin, and such vegetable substances as tannic and gallic acids. Balaustines are the red rose-like flowers of the pomegranate, which are very bitter to the taste. In medicine, their dried form has been used as an astringent. Some metal salts and acids have also been used as astringents. Redness-reducing eye drops contain an astringent. Use of Goulard's Extract has been discontinued, because of lead poisoning.\n"}
{"id": "2050909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050909", "title": "Child psychopathology", "text": "Child psychopathology\n\nChild psychopathology refers to the scientific study of mental disorders in children and adolescents. Oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder are examples of psychopathology that are typically first diagnosed during childhood. Mental health providers who work with children and adolescents are informed by research in developmental psychology, clinical child psychology, and family systems. Lists of child and adult mental disorders can be found in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition (ICD-10), published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\", Fifth Edition (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In addition, the \"Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood\" (DC: 0-3R) is used in assessing mental health and developmental disorders in children up to age five.\n\nThe etiology of child psychopathology has many explanations which differ from case to case. Many psychopathological disorders in children involve genetic and physiological mechanisms, though there are still many without any physical grounds. It is absolutely imperative that multiple sources of data be gathered. \"Diagnosing the psychopathology of children is daunting. It is influenced by development and contest, in addition to the traditional sources. Interviews with parents about school, etc., are inadequate. Either reports from teachers or direct observation by the professional are critical.\" (author, Robert B. Bloom, Ph.D.) The disorders with physical or biological mechanisms are easier to diagnose in children and are often diagnosed earlier in childhood. However, there are some disorders, no matter the mechanisms, that are not identified until adulthood. There is also reason to believe that there is co-morbidity of disorders, in that if one disorder is present, there is often another.\n\nEmotional stress or trauma in the parent-child relationship tends to be a cause of child psychopathology. First seen in infants, separation anxiety in root of parental-child stress may lay the foundations for future disorders in children. There is a direct correlation between maternal stress and child stress that is factored in both throughout adolescences development. In a situation where the mother is absent, any primary caregiver to the child could be seen as the \"maternal\" relationship. Essentially, the child would bond with the primary caregiver, exuding some personality traits of the caregiver.\n\nIn studies of child in two age groups of pregnancy to five years, and fifteen years and twenty years, Raposa and colleagues (2011) studied the impact of psychopathology in the child-maternal relationship and how not only the mothers stress affected the child, but the child's stress affected the mother. Historically, it was believed that mothers who suffered from post partum depression might be the reason their child suffers from mental disorders both earlier and later in development. However this correlation was found to not only reflect maternal depression on child psychopathology, but also child psychopathology could reflect on maternal depression.\n\nChildren with a predisposition to psychopathology may cause higher stress in the relationship with their mother, and mothers who suffer from psychopathology may also cause higher stress in the relationship with their child. Child psychopathology creates stress in parenting which may increase the severity of the psychopathology within the child. Together, these factors push and pull the relationship thus causing higher levels of depression, ADHD, defiant disorder, learning disabilities, and pervasive developmental disorder in both the mother and the child. The outline and summary of this study is found below:\n\"\"In looking at child-related stress, the number of past child mental health diagnoses significantly predicted a higher number of acute stressors for mothers as well as more chronic stress in the mother-child relationship at age 15. These increased levels of maternal stress and mother-child relationship stress at age 15 then predicted higher levels of maternal depression when the youth were 20 years old.\n\nLooking more closely at the data, the authors found that it was the chronic stress in the mother-child relationship and the child-related acute stressors that were the linchpins between child psychopathology and maternal depression. The stress is what fueled the fires between mother and child mental health. Going one step further, the researchers found that youth with a history of more than one diagnosis as well as youth that had externalizing disorders (e.g., conduct disorder) had the highest number of child-related stressors and the highest levels of mother-child stress. Again, all of the findings held up when other potentially stressful variables, such as economic worries and past maternal depression, were controlled for.\n\nAdditionally, siblings- both older and younger and of both genders, can be factored into the etiology and development of child psychopathology. In a longitudinal study of maternal depression and older male child depression and antisocial behaviors on younger siblings adolescent mental health outcome. The study factored in ineffective parenting and sibling conflicts such as sibling rivalry. Younger female siblings were more directly affected by maternal depression and older brother depression and anti social behaviors when the indirect effects were not place, in comparison to younger male siblings who showed no such comparison. However, if an older brother were anti-social, the younger child- female or male would exude higher anti-social behaviors. In the presence of a sibling conflict, anti social behavior was more influential on younger male children than younger female children. Female children were more sensitive to pathological familial environments, thus showing that in a high- stress environment with both maternal depression and older- male sibling depression and anti social behavior, there is a higher risk of female children developing psychopathological disorders. This was a small study, and more research needs to be done especially with older female children, paternal relationships, maternal-paternal-child stress relationships, and/or caregiver-child stress relationships if the child is orphaned or not being raised by the biological child to reach a conclusive child-parent stress model on the effects of familial and environmental pathology on the child's development.\n\nThe child-parent stress and development is only one hypothesis for the etiology of child psychopathology. Other experts believe that child temperament is a large factor in the development of child psychopathology. High susceptibility to child psychopathology is marked by low levels of effortful control and high levels of emotionality and neuroticism. Parental divorce is often a large factor in childhood depression and other psychopathological disorders. This is more so when the divorce involves a long-drawn separation and one parent bad-mouthing the other. That is not to say that divorce will lead to psychopathological disorders, there are also other factors such as temperament, trauma, and other negative life events (e.g. death, sudden moving of home, physical or sexual abuse), genetics, environment, and nurture that correlate to the onset of a disorder. Research has also shown that child maltreatment may increase risk for various forms of psychopathology as it increases threat sensitivity, decreases responsivity to reward, and causes deficits in emotion recognition and understanding.\n\nFound in \"The Role of Temperament in the Etiology of Child Psychopathology\", a model for the etiology of child psychopathology by Vasey and Dadds (2001) proposed that the four things that are important to the development of psychopathological disorders is: 1) biological factors: hormones, genetics, neurotransmitters 2) psychological: self-esteem, coping skills, cognitive issues 3) social factors: family rearing, negative learning experiences, and stress 4) child's temperament. Using an array of neurological scans and exams, psychological evaluations, family medical history, and observing the child in daily factors can help the physician find the etiology of the psychopathological disorder to help release the child of the symptoms through therapy, medication use, social skills training, and life style changes.\n\nChild psychopathology can cause separation anxiety from parents, attention deficit disorders in children, sleep disorders in children, aggression with both peers and adults, night terrors, extreme anxiety, anti social behavior, depression symptoms, aloof attitude, sensitive emotions, and rebellious behavior that are not in line of typical childhood development. Aggression is found to manifest in children before five years of age, and early stress and aggression in the parental-child relationship correlates with the manifestation of aggression. Aggression in children causes problematic peer relationships, difficulty adjusting, and coping problems. Children who fail to overcome acceptable ways of coping and emotion expression are put on tract for psychopathological disorders and violent and anti social behaviors into adolescence and adulthood. There is a higher rate of substance abuse in these children with coping and aggression issues, and causes a cycle of emotional instability and manifestation psychopathological disorders.\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of many psychopathology disorders a child can suffer from. In the neurobiological scheme, borderline personality disorder may have effects on the left amygdala. In a 2003 study of BPD patients versus control patients, when faced with expressions that were happy, sad, or fearful BPD patients showed significantly more activation versus control patients. In neutral faces, BPD patients attributed negative qualities to these faces.\nAs stated by Gabbard, an experimenter in this study:\n\"A hyperactive amygdala may be involved in the predisposition to be hyper vigilant and over reactive to relatively benign emotional expressions. Misreading neutral faces is clearly related to transference misreadings that occur in psychotherapy and the creation of bad object experiences linked with projective identification.\"\n\nAlso linked to BPD, is the presence of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in a short allele demonstrated larger amygdala neuronal activity when presented with fearful stimuli as in comparison to individuals with a long allele of 5-HTT. As found in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study a short allele of 5-HTT predisposes the person to have hyperactivity in the amygdala in response to trauma, and thus moderated the impact of stressful life events leading to a higher risk of depression and suicidal idealities. These same qualities were not observed in individuals with long alleles of 5-HTT. However, the environment the child is in can change in impact of this gene, proving that correct treatment, intensive social support, and a healthy and nurturing environment can modify genetic vulnerability.\n\nPossibly the most studied or documented of the child psychopathologies is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which is marked with learning disabilities, mood disorders, and/or aggression. Though believed to be over diagnosed, ADHD is highly comorbid for other disorders such as depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. In studies of the prefrontal cortex in ADHD children, which is responsible for the regulation of behavior, cognition, and attention; and in the dopamine system there has been identified a hidden genetic polymorphisms. More specific, the 7-repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene, responsible for inhibited prefrontal cortex cognition and less efficient receptors, causes more externalized behaviors such as aggression since the child has trouble \"thinking through\" seemingly ordinary and at level childhood tasks.\n\nAgenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is used to determine the frequency of social and behavioral problems in children with a prevalence rate of about 2-3%. ACC is described as a defect in the brain where the 200 million axons that make the corpus collosum are either completely absent, or partially gone. In many cases, the anterior commissure is still present to allow for the passing of information from one cerebral hemisphere to the other. The children are of normal intelligence level. For younger children, ages two to five, Agenesis of the corpus callosum causes problems in sleep. Sleep is critical for development in children, and lack of sleep can set the grounds for a manifestation of psychopathological disorders. In children ages six to eleven, ACC showed manifestation in problems with social function, thought, attention, and somatic grievances. In comparison, of children with autism, children with ACC showed less impairment on almost all scales such as anxiety and depression, attention, abnormal thoughts, and social function versus autistic children. However, a small percentage of children with ACC showed traits that may lead to the diagnosis of autism in the areas of social communications and social interactions but do not show the same symptoms of autism in the repetitive and restricted behaviors category. The difficulties from ACC may lead to the etiology of child psychopathological disorders, such as depression or ADHD and manifest many autistic-like disorders that can cause future psychological disorders in later adolescence.\nThe etiology of child psychopathology is a multi-factor path. A slew of factors must be taken into account before diagnosis of a disorder.\n\nThe child's genetics, environment, temperament, past medical history, family medical history, prevalence of symptoms and neuro-anatomical structures are all factors that should be considered when diagnosing a child with a psychopathological disorder. Thousands of children each year are misdiagnosed and put on the wrong treatment, which may result in the manifestation of other disorders the child would have not have gotten else wise. There are hundreds of causes of psychopathological disorders, and each one manifests at different ages and stages in child development and can come out due to trauma and stress. Some disorders may \"disappear\" and reappear in the presence of a trauma, depression, or stress similar to the one that brought the disorder out in the child in the beginning.\n\nIt is estimated that 5% of children under the age of eight suffer from a psychopathology disorder. Girls more frequently manifested disorders than boys in similar situations. By age sixteen about thirty percent of children will have fit the criteria for at least one psychopathology disorder. Only a small number of these children receive treatment for their disorder. Anxiety and depression disorders in children- whether noted or unnoted, are found to be a precursor for similar episodes in adulthood. Usually a large stressor similar to the one the person experienced in childhood brings out the anxiety or depression in adulthood.\n\nMultifinality refers to the idea that two children can react to same stressful event quite differently, and may display divergent types of problem behavior. Psychopathological disorders are extremely situational- having to take into account the child, the genetics, the environment, the stressor, and many other factors to tailor the best type of treatment to relieve the child of the psychopathology symptoms.\n\nMany child psychopathology disorders are treated with control medications prescribed by a pediatrician or psychiatrist. After extensive evaluation of the child through school visits, by psychologists and physicians, a medication can be prescribed. A patient may need to go through several trials of medicines to find the best fit, as many cause uncomfortable and undesired side effects- such as dry mouth or suicidal thoughts can occur. There are many classes of drugs a physician can choose from and they are: psychostimulants, beta blockerss, atypical antipsychotics, lithium, alpha-2 agonists, traditional antipsychotics, SSRIs, and anticonvulsant mood- stabilizers. Given the multifinality of psychopathological disorders, two children may be on the same medication for two completely different disorders, or have the same disorder and be taking two completely different medications.\n\nADHD is the most successfully treated disorder of child psychopathology, and the medications used have a high- abuse rate especially among college-aged students. Psycho stimulants such as Ritalin, amphetamine- related stimulant drugs: e.g., Adderall, and antidepressants such as Wellbutrin have been successfully used to treat ADHD with a 78% success rate. Many of these drug treatment options are paired with behavioral treatment such as therapy or social skills lessons.\n\nLithium has shown to be extremely effective in treating ADHD and bipolar disorder. Lithium treats both mania and depression and helps prevent relapse. The mechanism of lithium include the inhibition of GSK-3, it is a glutamate antagonism at NMDA receptors that together make lithium a neuroprotective medicine. The drug relieves bipolar symptoms, aggressiveness and irritability. Lithium has many, many side effects and requires weekly blood tests to tests for toxicity of the drug. \n\nMedications that act on cell membrane ion channels, are GABA inhibitory neurotransmission, and also inhibit excitatory glutamate transmission have shown to be extremely effective in treating an array of child psychopathological disorders. Pharmaceutical companies are in the process of creating new drugs and improving those on the market to help avoid negative and possibly life altering short term and long term side effects, making drugs more safe to use in younger children and over long periods of time during adolescent development.\n\nThe future of child psychopathology- etiology and treatment has a two-way path. While many professionals agree that many children who suffer from a disorder do not receive proper treatment, at the rate of 5-15% that receive treatment leaving many children in the dark. In the same boat are the physicians who also say that not only do more of these disorders need to be recognized in children and treated properly, but also even those children who show some qualifying symptoms of a disorder but not to the degree of diagnosis should also receive treatment and therapy to avoid the manifestation of the disorder. By treating children even with slight degrees of a psychopathological disorder, children can show improvements in their relationships with peers, family, and teachers and also improvements in school, mental health, and personal development. Many physicians believe the best prevention and help starts in the home and the school of the child, before physicians and psychologists are contacted.\n\nSo while there is more awareness of child psychopathological disorders and more research to prevent and effectively treat these disorders to maintain healthy emotional health in children, there is also a negative factor in that parents, schools, and psychologists may be more sensitive and therefore over-diagnose children with these disorders. Mental health professionals and pharmaceutical marketing companies need to be cautious of making disorders too readily diagnosed and treated with medications.\n\nChild psychopathology is a real thing that thousands of children suffer from. While hundreds of children are diagnosed with a new disorder daily, researchers are developing new strategies to beat these disorders in children to allow all children the right to a happy and healthy childhood. With further education on the symptoms and implications of child psychopathology, psychologists and physicians will improve their accuracy in diagnosing children- giving the right diagnosis and discovering the most helpful treatment and therapies for children.\n\nThe current trend in the U.S. is to understand child psychopathology from a systems based perspective called developmental psychopathology. Recent emphasis has also been on understanding psychological disorders from a relational perspective with attention also given to neurobiology. Practitioners who follow attachment theory believe that early attachment experiences of children can promote adaptive strategies or lay the groundwork for maladaptive ways of coping which can later lead to mental health disorders.\n\nResearch and clinical work on child psychopathology tends to fall under several main areas: etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, assessment, and treatment.\n\nParents are considered a reliable source of information because they spend more time with children than any other adult. A child's psychopathology can be connected to parental behaviors. Clinicians and researchers have experienced problems with children's self-reports and rely on adults to provide the information.\n"}

Tillabéri Region was created in 1992, when Niamey Region was split, with Niamey and its immediate hinterland becoming a new \"capital district\" enclaved within Tillabéri Region.\n\nTillabéri borders Mali (Gao Region) to the north, Tahoua Region to the east, Dosso Region to the southeast, Benin (Alibori Department) to the south, and Burkina Faso (Sahel Region and Est Region) to the west. The Niamey Capital District forms an enclave within the region. Tillabéri contains almost all of Niger's share of the Niger river, as well as several seasonal (known as Gorouol, Sirba) and permanent (known as Mékrou, Tapoa) watercourses. The W National Park is located in the extreme south of the region and extends into Burkina Faso and Benin. The northwestern areas of the region (Ouallam and Filingué) have a savannah type flora and fauna.\n\nTillabéri is the regional capital; other major settlements include Abala, Ayourou, Banibangou, Bankilare, Filingue, Ouallam, Say, Téra and Torodi.\n\nTillabéri is divided into 6 departments:\n\nAs of 2012 the population of the region was 2,722,482. The main ethnolinguistic grousp are the Fulani, Gurma, Hausa, Tuareg, Zarma (also referred to as 'Djerma').\n\nThe economy of the region of Tillabéri is based primary on agriculture, livestock and fishery production. However, Tillabéri is rich in mineral resources (gold and iron ore) and increasingly becoming attractive for future mining investments. In 2004, the first gold mine in Téra began operation. In addition, the region of Tillabéri has great touristic potential with W Park, the Niger river and many more attractions. \nBased on data from the National Statistics Institute of Niger, The region of Tillaberi is 1st producer of rice (5,700 tonnes), 5th for sorghum (40,900 tonnes), 5th for millet (39,9400 tonnes), 3rd for corn (1,100 tonnes), 5th for black-eyed peas (15,3000 tonnes) and 5th in peanut (2,400 tonnes) in 2011 among regions. It is also an important livestock producer and the 1st producer of cattle with recorded 2087 thousand cattle heads in 2011. Although the Niger river is crossing through this region, it is only the 3rd producer of fishery products with 637 thousand tonnes in 2011.\n\nThe region is home to the Samira Hill Gold Mine in Téra, which opened in 2004. In addition to gold, the region is rich in iron ore with estimated reserves of 650 million tonnes in Say.\n\nThe region of Tillabéri has many tourist sites. The W National Park of Niger, which straddles the tri-border area of Benin-Burkina Faso-Niger, is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The park contains a wide variety of fauna and flora on side located in Niger.. The region has a modest hospitality infrastructure with only two 4-star hotels and 137 rooms (42 rooms for the 4 star hotels).\n\n"}

The station sits underneath the Connexion building, an integrated hospital (Farrer Park Hospital) and hotel complex (One Farrer Hotel).\n\nFarrer Park was named after John Farrer, who was President of the Municipal Commissioners from 1919 to 1931.\n\nTo accommodate the construction of the station, the formerly straight Race Course Road was broken up to its current two-part alignment, with both ends linked by junctions with Rangoon Road. Owen Road was also broken into two, as evident from its current alignment between Serangoon Road and Pek Kio estate. 55 lots required for the construction of the Farrer Park MRT station and the realignment of Race Course Road need to be surrendered by March 1997. However, as for the 51 lots required for the widening of Tessensohn Road and comprehensive redevelopment, the date of possession can be deferred to December 1997.\n\nBefore the station opened, the Singapore Civil Defence Force conducted the second ever Shelter Open House on 15–16 February 2003, together with Chinatown, Serangoon, and Hougang stations.\n\nOn the evening of 25 December 2007, some technical difficulties were experienced along the North East line caused delays for train services.

It was Japan's first domestically designed and built supersonic combat aircraft, jointly developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries. It is essentially a T-2 trainer airframe modified for a dedicated anti-ship and ground attack role.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) commenced studies into an advanced jet trainer which could also be modified to serve in the ground attack and anti-shipping roles. After considering license production of the T-38 Talon and SEPECAT Jaguar, Japan decided to develop its own trainer, the supersonic Mitsubishi T-2, this first flying on 20 July 1971. Cost over-runs in the T-2 program led to the proposed single seat attack version almost being abandoned, but the cancellation of the Kawasaki P-XL, the planned replacement for Japan's Kawasaki P-2J maritime patrol aircraft freed-up funds, while making it important to keep Japan's aviation industry employed, and contracts were awarded for the development of the attack version as the FS-T2kai in 1973.\n\nThe new aircraft was a minimum change derivative of the T-2, with the rear cockpit being converted to an avionics bay by removing the rear seat, and replacing the canopy with a simple unglazed access hatch. Two additional hardpoints were fitted under the wing to allow carriage of a heavier weapon load, and the avionics were improved, with a new J/AWG-12 radar set, similar to that fitted in British Royal Air Force F-4M Phantom fighter jets. This set provides ranging information. Aside from the avionics changes, deletion of the rear seat, and new one-piece canopy, the only other major change from the T-2 was the strengthening of the airframe to enable it to carry a larger weapons load than the T-2. The F-1 is fitted with an internally mounted 20 mm JM61A1 Vulcan cannon with 750 rounds of ammunition. The aircraft also has seven external hardpoints for the carriage of a wide variety of stores. The fuselage hardpoint and inboard pair of underwing hardpoints are plumbed for external fuel tanks to increase the aircraft's range. The primary weapon of the F-1 is the ASM-1 and the newer ASM-2 long-range anti-ship missile. This weapon is roughly in the class of the American AGM-84 Harpoon or French AM.39 Exocet. Other weapons carried include the all-aspect short-range heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile for air-to-air combat. This weapon is carried on the wingtip rails usually, but it can also be carried on the outboard underwing hardpoints for the F-1's secondary air defense role. Other air-to-ground weapons carried include rocket pods (JLAU-3/A) of 70 mm (2.75 in) size as well as bombs of 227 kg (500 lb) and 340 kg (750 lb) in size (Mk82 and M117 respectively). In addition, the Mk-82 and M117 bombs can be fitted with infrared guidance kits, turning them into precision-guided weapons that home in on heat radiation emitted from seaborne targets such as ships or other ground-based targets. When fitted with this kit, the bomb becomes known as GCS-1.\n\nThe F-1 was replaced by the F-2 (Japan/U.S. developed, based on the F-16C/D), as well as upgraded F-4EJ Kai Phantom IIs. The last six active F-1s, based at Tsuiki in Fukuoka Prefecture, were retired on 9 March 2006, having reached the 4,000 hour limit of their airframes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can accommodate ships up to 1,000 tons and is serviced by five shipping companies, providing passenger and cargo service to Santander and Cebu City in Cebu; Tagbilaran in Bohol; Dumaguete in Negros Oriental, and Plaridel in Misamis Occidental.\n\nCanoan, which was how Larena was known during the Spanish period, had long been a flourishing township. It was mainly due to this fact that the Spanish authorities developed it into a headtown or \"cabecera\" for the whole island of Siquijor.\n\nWith the coming of the Americans at the turn of the century, Canoan still was regarded as a \"cabecera\" where lieutenant governor James Fugate, the first American governor of Siquijor, held office for sixteen years ending in 1916. In the same year, the authorities in Manila, acting on the recommendation of local authorities officially declared Canoan as a capital town. During his term which began in 1901, Governor Demetrio Larena, the first Filipino governor for Negros Oriental and Siquijor, changed the name of Canoan to Larena, his own name, which was duly approved by the Philippine legislature.\n\nFrom then on until the declaration of martial law in 1972, several people shared the mayoral seat after every four years.\nAlbito was followed by Restituto Calibo.

Juanito Calibo followed and stayed for most of the martial law era and again succeeded by Herbert Calibo.\n\nThe post-EDSA Revolution saw Remedios Albito mayor until the present, having beat others in three elections since then. Thus the intertwined dynasties continue.\n\nAll through the years, spanning the time before and after the war, Larena maintained its position as the hub of business activities in the province. The small but safe port of Larena is a strategic port of call for merchant ships from major cities in Central Visayas and Northern Mindanao. It is home to two commercial banks and a rural bank.

{"id": "2050949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050949", "title": "Blind musicians", "text": "Blind musicians\n\nBlind musicians are singers or instrumentalists, or in some cases singer-accompanists, who are legally blind.\n\nHistorically, many blind musicians, including some of the most famous, have performed without the benefit of formal instruction, since such instruction relies extensively on written musical notation. However, today there are many resources available for blind musicians who wish to learn Western music theory and classical notation. Louis Braille, the man who created the braille alphabet for the blind, also created a system of classical notation for the blind called Braille music. This system allows the blind to read and write music much as the sighted do. The largest collection of Braille musical scores is located at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Outside the U.S., the largest collection of braille music scores is stored at the National Library for the Blind in England. \n\nComputer technology and the Internet make it possible in theory for blind musicians to be more independent in composing and studying music. In practice, however, most programs rely on graphical user interfaces, which are difficult for the blind to navigate. There has been some progress in creating screen-reading interfaces for the blind, especially for the Windows operating systems.\n\nToday there are also several organizations devoted to the support of blind musicians. The National Resource Center for Blind Musicians and The Music Education Network for the Visually Impaired are dedicated to musical education for the blind.\n\nThe image of the blind musician is an important touchstone in many cultures, even where the influence of the blind on music has been limited. The idea of Homer, the blind poet, for example, has had a long existence in Western tradition, even though its basis in truth is uncertain. The legendary 6th century Breton druid and bard Kian Gwenc'hlan is depicted as \nbeing imprisoned after having his eyes gouged out for refusing to convert to Christianity and singing out that he isn't afraid to die. \n\nIn his book \"Singer of Tales\", Albert Lord explains that in Yugoslavia he found many stories of blind musicians, but few current musicians who were actually blind. Natalie Kononenko had a similar experience in Turkey, though one Turkish musician of great talent, Ashik Veysel, was in fact blind. \nThe popularity of the idea of the blind musician has inspired several artists. John Singer Sargent painted a 1912 canvas based on this theme, and Georges de La Tour has a whole series of paintings devoted to blind musicians. \n\nThough the idea of blind musicians may be even more prevalent than their actuality, it remains true that at many points in history and in many different cultures, blind musicians, individually or as a group, have made important contributions to the development of music. Some of these contributions are discussed below.\n\nBlind musicians have also appeared in Muslim harems to entertain the patron and his wives.\n\nRobert Heinlein made a science fiction use of the \"blind bard\" theme in \"The Green Hills of Earth\".\n\nCourt musician was a traditional profession for the blind in China in antiquity. The first musician mentioned in Chinese sources, Shi Kuang, was a blind performer in the 6th century BC. The Guilds of Blind Musicians and Fortune-Tellers, which were still around in China during the middle of the 20th century, claimed to have existed as far back as 200 BC. More recently, groups of blind buskers have continued to perform in Zuoquan County, and presumably in other areas as well. \n\nOne of the most popular musical works in China, \"Erquan Yingyue (Moon Reflected in the Second Spring)\", was composed in the first half of the 20th century by Hua Yanjun, better known as \"Blind Ah Bing\".\n\nIn Japan, Heike Biwa, a form of narrative music, was invented and spread during the Kamakura period (1185–1333) by traveling musicians known as biwa hoshi, who were often blind. These musicians played the biwa, a kind of lute, and recited stories, of which the most famous was The Tale of the Heike. The musicians were sometimes known as \"blind priests\" because they wore robes and shaved their heads, though they were not in fact Buddhist priests.\n\nGoze were similar communities of visually impaired female shamisen and kokyū players who travelled around the country singing songs and begging alms.\n\nThere is a long tradition of performance by blind minstrels in Ukraine known as \"Kobzarstvo\". At least from 1800 to 1930 — and probably well before that as well — the majority of itinerant musicians in Ukraine were blind. Music was an important part of the culture. Those who could not work at other occupations could be apprenticed to become professional bards, often referred to as \"kobzars\" (both bandura and lira players could be referred to by this title). These wandering blind minstrels were divided into two groups—bandurists, or \"kobzars\" who played bandura, and \"lirnyks\", who played the lira, which was a crank-driven hurdy-gurdy.\n\nThe \"kobzars\" were an important part of oral tradition in Ukraine. According to the ethnographer P. Zhytetsky, \"kobzars\" were thought to have been initially sighted Cossacks, who were especially associated with epic songs, or \"dumas\". Kononenko states that \"lirnyks\", on the other hand, were blind church singers organized into guilds who sang religious songs and were often associated with beggars. By the middle of the 19th century, the two groups had merged; both sang many different types of songs, all were organized into the guilds, and all were blind.\n\nThe \"kobzars\" have a central place in the national identity of Ukraine. Folklorist Izmail Sreznevskyi argued that the initial Cossack bandurists were actual witnesses of the great battles about which they sang. The image of warrior-bards singing epics was quite popular, and there became a tradition that the great ancient singers were veterans valorously blinded in combat. This in turn led to the belief that the kobzar tradition had greatly weakened in the 19th century, since the traditional songs were now sung by people who were more like beggars than like warriors. Kononenko points out that there is no factual basis for this image, and her research showed that the minstrel tradition was still very strong and creative up until the 1930s.\n\nBecause the art of the \"kobzars\" was language-specific and included themes dealing with historic subjects of Ukraine's past, the blind singers were often the focus of persecution by occupying powers, according to researcher Mikhailo Khay. This persecution reached its height under Joseph Stalin in the 1930s, when many forms of Ukrainian cultural expression were crushed by the communist government of the Soviet Union. In the late 1930s many bandurists were arrested and some shot. Documents have been discovered to show that the renowned bandurist Hnat Khotkevych was executed in 1938 and the blind \"kobzar\" Ivan Kucherenko was shot in 1937.\n\nNumerous sources claim that there was an organized large scale massacre of Ukrainian blind musicians in the 1930s, though this has not been confirmed by official documents, and most details of the incident (including year, place, and method of execution) are disputed. Traditional blind minstrelsy by the late 1930s had largely vanished.\n\nToday, the traditional repertoire of the \"kobzars\" is performed by sighted, educated performers. During her research in Ukraine, Kononenko found only one blind folk performer of the old songs, a man named Pavlo Suprun, who had studied bandura playing and voice at the Kiev State Conservatory.\n\nDuring the medieval and early modern eras, harpists, pipers, and other musicians traveled around Ireland, providing music for dances and other occasions. As in Ukraine, many of the Irish musicians were blind. It was common practice for blind or disabled children to be taught a musical instrument as a means of supporting themselves, as they could not perform hard labour.\n\nThe most famous of these blind musicians, harper Turlough O'Carolan, composed many tunes that have become part of the traditional repertoire, including \"Sidh Beag Sidh Mór\" and \"Carolan's Concerto\". \n\nOthers included Eoghain Ó Cianáin (fl. 1540), Nicholas Dáll Pierce (fl. 1601), William fitz Robert Barry (fl. 1615), Ruaidri Dáll Ó Catháin (died 1653), Higgins of Tyrawley (fl. 18th century), and Martin O'Reilly (1829–1904).\n\nThere is a long tradition of blind organists. In the 20th century some of the greatest organists were blind, including the great German Bach scholar and teacher Helmut Walcha (1907–1991), and a number of prominent French organists and composers for the organ including Louis Vierne (1870–1937), Andre Marchal (1894–1980), Gaston Litaize (1909–1991), and Jean Langlais (1907–1991), as well as one of the current organists at Notre Dame de Paris, Jean-Pierre Leguay (b. 1939). England has also produced brilliant blind organists in the 19th and 20th centuries, including Alfred Hollins (1865–1942) and David A. Liddle (b. 1960), who was a student of Marchal and who currently enjoys an international performing career. Yet it is a tradition which goes back centuries: 14th-century Italian Francesco Landini (?–1397), Spanish baroque master Antonio de Cabezon (1510–1566) and the Englishmen John Stanley (1712–1786) are prominent examples, and one could argue that even Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frederic Handel, who lost their sight late in life but presumably continued to play and compose, should be included in this discussion, along with the great American popular organist George Wright (1920–1998), who likewise lost his sight late in life but continued to present concerts and make sound recordings until his death. Blind composer Frances McCollin (1892–1960) won the Clemson Prize from the American Guild of Organists in 1918. She studied organ with another blind musician, David Duffield Wood (1838–1910), the organist at Philadelphia's St. Stephen's Episcopal Church for many years.\n\nIn 19th century France and England, piano tuners were frequently blind. The first blind piano tuner is thought to be Claude Montal, who taught himself how to tune a piano while studying at L'Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles in 1830. At first Montal's teachers were skeptical, doubting that a blind man could actually perform the necessary mechanical tasks. Montal's skill was undeniable, however, and he was soon asked to teach classes in tuning to his fellow students. Eventually, he also overcame public prejudice, and landed several prestigious jobs as a tuner for professors and professional musicians. Montal's success paved the way for other blind tuners, both in France and in England, where Montal's example and teaching methods were adopted by Thomas Rhodes Armitage. Today the image of the blind piano tuner is so ingrained that people in England sometimes express surprise when they encounter a piano tuner who can see. An organization of blind piano tuners remains active in Britain.\n\nBlind musicians have made a significant contribution to American popular music. This is particularly true in blues, gospel, jazz, and other predominantly African American forms – perhaps because discrimination at the time made it more difficult for black blind people to find other employment. In any case, the achievement of blind African-Americans in music is extensive. The first recorded gospel sanctified barrelhouse piano player, Arizona Dranes, was blind, as were Al Hibbler, and Ray Charles, one of the most important figures in the creation of soul music. Art Tatum, commonly cited as the greatest jazz pianist of all time, was also almost blind. Stevie Wonder, who was blind from birth, has recorded more than thirty U.S. top ten hits and won twenty-two Grammy Awards (the most ever won by a solo artist in history).\n\nHowever, blind black musicians are still most strongly associated with the country blues. The first successful male country blues performer, Blind Lemon Jefferson, was blind, as were many other country bluesmen, including Blind Willie McTell, Blind Willie Johnson, Sonny Terry, Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Blake and Reverend Gary Davis. The figure of the blind country bluesman became so iconic that when Eddie Lang, a sighted jazz guitarist, wanted to choose a black pseudonym for purposes of recording blues records with Lonnie Johnson, he naturally settled on Blind Willie Dunn. Bogus Ben Covington was known for pretending to be blind. John William Boone, known as \"Blind Boone\", was an important American pianist and composer of ragtime.\n\nRonnie Milsap is a white Grammy Award-winning American singer, songwriter, and musician. He began his career as a heavy R&B soul artist but is most known for his country and pop music career. Jeff Healey was a blind Juno Award-winning and Grammy Award-nominated Canadian blues-rock vocalist and guitarist who attained musical and personal popularity, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. Legendary American guitarist and songwriter Doc Watson was blinded before his first birthday from an eye infection, and went on to become a highly influential musician in American bluegrass and folk music, known for his proficient flatpicking and fingerpicking skills on guitar as well as his extensive knowledge of traditional American songs.\n\nThe Italian pop tenor, Andrea Bocelli, who was born with congenital glaucoma and completely lost his sight at the age of 12, after a football accident, is the biggest-selling singer in the history of classical music, with worldwide sales exceeding 70 million copies.\n\nIn 2009, Japanese Nobuyuki Tsujii, at age 20, became the first blind pianist to win the top prize at a major international competition, the 13th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. He was also awarded the Beverley Taylor Smith Award for the Best Performance of a New Work. He played all twelve of Frédéric Chopin's Op. 10 Études as part of his performance in the preliminaries. Born blind, Tsujii developed his own technique for learning complex classical piano works. With videos of his piano performances widely viewable on the Internet, Tsujii's competition win has made him an international sensation. As of 2010, Tsujii's discography includes ten CDs, some of which have sold over 100,000 copies. As a Van Cliburn winner, Tsujii has been performing in concerts all over the world.\n\nComposers as diverse and exceptional as Francesco Landini, Antonio de Cabezón, and Joaquín Rodrigo suffered from childhood-onset blindness. In a unique mix of circumstances, the blind Viennese composer Rudolf Braun wrote works for piano left hand for the one-armed pianist Paul Wittgenstein.\n\nOne of the prominent blind South Indian carnatic musicians is M. Chandrasekaran, a violin maestro who has received some of the highest awards by many musical institutions in India. His musical career spans over six decades and he has travelled to perform in many music festivals all over India and the world.\n"}

A California fire prevention guide recommends to \"Remove all tree branches at least 6 feet [1.8 meters] from the ground\" and \"Allow extra vertical space between shrubs and trees.\"\n\nIn British English, limbing can be synonymous with snedding. Alternatively, limbing can be used to describe the operation on larger branches, and snedding on smaller.\n\nOptions for cutting off the branches include chain saws, harvesters, stroke delimbers and others. Limbing can happen at the stump in log/tree length systems and cut-to-length systems or at the landing in whole-tree logging.\n\nWhen the tree is lying on the ground, branches may be storing enormous potential energy through mechanical strain. When a branch is cut, often with a chain saw, this energy can be released suddenly and the branch can jump dangerously. In addition, a branch may be supporting the tree, and the tree can fall or roll when the branch is cut. For these reasons, limbing is a skilled operation requiring careful safety planning.\n\n"}

It was named for Prince Henry, the eldest son of King James I.\n\nThe site of Henricus is located on a neck of land called Farrar's Island, which later became part of the Shire of Henrico (1634) and was renamed Henrico County in 1637.\n\nToday, the settlement is interpreted via Henricus Historical Park, a living history museum.\n\nHenricus was one of the earliest English settlements in the New World. It was located on the neck of a peninsula later known as Farrar's Island, a former curl of the James River about 12 miles southeast of the modern city of Richmond, Virginia. At the time, the First Anglo-Powhatan War was raging, and the natives offered much resistance to the English encroachment, largely orchestrated by native captain Nemattanew — or as the English garrison knew him, \"Jack-of-the-Feather\". Prior to the development of Richmond, Henricus was one of the westernmost outlying developments from the Colony of Virginia's fortified capital downriver at Jamestown. In 1612–1613, a facility known as \"Mt. Malady\" was built nearby; it was the first hospital in the English colonies of North America.\n\nThis settlement was near where Pocahontas grew up among the Appomattoc tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy. Reverend Alexander Whitaker converted her to Christianity during her time at Henricus under Sir Thomas Dale, deputy governor of the colony. She met colonist John Rolfe during this time and they married on April 5, 1614. Rolfe's longtime friend, Richard Buck, presided at their wedding. They lived together across the river at the Varina Farms Plantation. Their mixed-race son, Thomas Rolfe (named for Sir Thomas Dale, deputy governor of the colony of Virginia), was born on the plantation. His descendants were among many of the so-called First Families of Virginia (FFV).\n\nThe Virginia Company tried to found the first institution of higher education in British America. In 1618, they obtained a royal charter for a proposed University of Henrico, and in 1619 the historic First Virginia General Assembly, meeting at Jamestown, passed their \"5th Petition: \"Send men to erect the Colledge\", referred to it as \"A worke of Conversion\", and set aside land for it adjacent to and above Henricus. In 1619, Henricus was also incorporated into the City of Henrico. The fort was abandoned by governor's orders during the Indian Massacre of 1622, and largely destroyed by the Powhatans afterwards.\n\nBy 1623, more settlers occupied the college land than before the massacre. The next year King James I of England dissolved the Virginia Company, seizing its assets and transforming the proprietary colony into a royal one. The Crown controlled it from then on.\n\nIn 1693, the College of William and Mary was established in Williamsburg. A plaque on the Wren Building, the college's first structure, ascribes the institution's origin to \"the college proposed at Henrico.\"\n\nThe area later saw action during the American Revolutionary War. During the American Civil War, the narrow neck of Farrar's Island on which Henricus was located was excavated to create the Dutch Gap Canal in an attempt to bypass Confederate defensive batteries along the James River. The channel was later widened, and the old river channel silted up, forming what is now the Dutch Gap Conservation Area.\n\nIn 1922, the former location of Henricus south of the Dutch Gap Canal was annexed from Henrico County by Chesterfield County.) Over time, the exact location of the former town of Henricus became uncertain. The archeological site in Chesterfield County was listed as \"Henrico\" on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Though archaeological evidence of the actual settlement has not been found (due to the creation of Dutch Gap and other disturbances nearby), a reconstruction based on historical evidence of the settlement has been created nearby as a living history museum, Henricus Historical Park.\n\n\n"}

He is best remembered for his prose translation of \"Roman de la rose\".\n\nBorn in Desvres, which is now part of France, he studied in Paris. He entered the service of Charles, Duke of Burgundy from 1463, becoming secretary to Georges Chastellain; in 1464 he wrote \"La complainte de Grece\", a political work presenting the Burgundian side in current affairs. He replaced Chastellain as historiographer in 1475, and he was also the librarian of Margaret of Austria. His chronicle covered the years 1474 to 1504, and was only published in 1828 after being edited by J. A. Buchon. It is considered inferior to Chastellain's chronicle, possessing less historical value.\n\nHe was the head of a Burgundian school of poetry called the Grands Rhétoriqueurs, characterised by their excessive use of puns. His nephew Jean Lemaire de Belges spent some time with him at Valenciennes, and Lemaire considered himself a disciple of the elder writer.\n\nIn 1501 he became canon of the church of Notre-Dame in Valenciennes, and he died there on 23 August 1507.\n\nMolinet was also a composer, although only one work, the rondeau \"Tart ara mon cueur sa plaisance\", can be reliably attributed to him; however this work, an early chanson for four voices (most were for three) was extremely popular, as evidenced by the wide distribution of copies. He is also remembered for the elegy he wrote on the death of Johannes Ockeghem, \"Nymphes des bois\", set by Josquin des Prez as part of his renowned motet \"La déploration sur la mort de Johannes Ockeghem\". Of other contemporary composers, both Antoine Busnois and Loyset Compère carried on correspondence with him.\n\nHistorian Johan Huizinga quotes some anti-clerical lines of Molinet's from a series of wishes for the New Year: \"Let us pray God that the Jacobins/May eat the Augustinians,/And that the Carmelites may be hanged/With the cords of the Minorites.\" \n"}

Other than the main service (EW4), Tanah Merah station is also the terminus for the Changi Airport branch line (CG) which is also part of the East West line.\n\nTanah Merah station is located at the boundaries of Bedok North and Bedok South planning subzones, and is built along New Upper Changi Road between the junctions of Bedok South Avenue 3/Tanah Merah Kechil Road and Tanah Merah Kechil Avenue.\n\nTanah Merah station is one of the only two elevated MRT stations to have more tracks than the conventional two train tracks on other stations (the other one being Ang Mo Kio). The middle track serves the train service of the Changi Airport Branch line, which terminates at Changi Airport.\n\nTanah Merah means red earth in Malay, which is derived from the red lateritic cliffs along the coast that were once visible from the sea (most of which were leveled into the sea for land reclamation works).\n\nSince 2017, Tanah Merah station is officially assigned the station code \"CG\", in addition to the station code \"EW4\" which the station originally had, to differentiate the operations of the main service and the Changi Airport branch line, albeit that it is not displayed on the signage of the station.\n\nAnnounced on 25 May 2019, the station will be transferred over to the Thomson–East Coast line by 2040, and the Changi branch of the East West line will cease to operate.\n\nOn 14 January 1986, the contract for building the Bedok MRT station, including the underpass and viaduct from Kembangan to Tanah Merah was awarded to RDC-Obayashi Joint Venture under Contracts 304 and 305. In addition, the contract for building the Tanah Merah MRT station and the line to Changi Depot was also awarded to Hyundai Engineering.\n\nThe station was originally not going to be open with the rest of the East West Line in between 1988 and 1989 as there were only private houses surrounding it, but increasing pressure from Members of Parliament and the public forced SMRT to open this station. When it opened, the demand was extremely stagnant, with only private houses, Bedok South housing estates and Fengshan housing estates to cater to. The demand increased when Singapore Expo and the MRT line to Changi Airport opened.\n\nAs with most of the above-ground stations built in the past along the East West line, it was built without platform screen doors. Due to the 2010 accident, installation of the half-height screen doors at this station commenced on 10 January 2011 and operations commenced on 30 March that year. It is also the final MRT station to have the HVLS fans installed, which went operational on 5 January 2013.\n\nThe addition of a new platform was announced by Land Transport Authority on 25 August 2014 to allow trains to arrive and depart at shorter intervals and an improvement in waiting times with the enhancements. On 26 October 2016, the Land Transport Authority awarded the civil contract to Lum Chang Building Contractors Pte. Ltd. to build a new platform at Tanah Merah station and viaducts for a contract sum of S$325 million. In addition to the new platforms, the existing East West line tracks will be extended to connect the line to the new four-in-one East Coast Integrated Depot at Changi, as well as the new underpass to be constructed, which will be Exit C to Tanah Merah Kechil Avenue and Exit D to The Glades Condominium. In order to facilitate construction, the road at New Upper Changi Road will have to be realigned and the Katong Flower Shop was closed down.

Environmental biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The International Society for Environmental Biotechnology defines environmental biotechnology as \"the development, use and regulation of biological systems for remediation of contaminated environments (land, air, water), and for environment-friendly processes (green manufacturing technologies and sustainable development)\".\n\nEnvironmental biotechnology can simply be described as \"the optimal use of nature, in the form of plants, animals, bacteria, fungi and algae, to produce renewable energy, food and nutrients in a synergistic integrated cycle of profit making processes where the waste of each process becomes the feedstock for another process\".\n\nScience through the IAASTD has called for the advancement of small-scale agro-ecological farming systems and technology in order to achieve food security, climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation and the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals. Environmental biotechnology has been shown to play a significant role in agroecology in the form of zero waste agriculture and most significantly through the operation of over 15 million biogas digesters worldwide.\n\nConsider an environment in which pollution of a particular type is maximum. Consider the effluents of a starch industry which has mixed up with a local water body like a lake or pond. We find huge deposits of starch which are not so easily taken up for degradation by micro-organisms except for a few exemptions. we isolate a few micro-organisms from the polluted site and scan for any significant changes in their genome like mutations or evolutions. The modified genes are then identified. This is done because, the isolate would have adapted itself to degrade/utilize the starch better than other microbes of the same genus. Thus, the resultant genes are cloned onto industrially significant micro-organisms and are used for more economically significant processes like in pharmaceutical industry, fermentations...etc.\n\nSimilar situations can be elucitated like in the case of oil spills in the oceans which require cleanup, microbes isolated from oil rich environments like oil wells, oil transfer pipelines...etc. have been found having the potential to degrade oil or use it as an energy source. Thus they serve as a remedy to oil spills.\n\nStill another elucidation would be in the case of microbes isolated from pesticide rich soils These would be capable of utilizing the pesticides as energy source and hence when mixed along with bio-fertilizers, would serve as excellent insurance against increased pesticide-toxicity levels in agricultural platform.\n\nBut the counter argument would be that whether these newly introduced microorganisms would create an imbalance in the environment concerned. The mutual harmony in which the organisms in that particular environment existed may have to face alteration and we should be extremely careful so as to not disturb the mutual relationships already existing in the environment of both the benefits and the disadvantages would pave way for an improvised version of environmental biotechnology. After all it is the environment that we strive to protect.\n\nHumans have been manipulating genetic material for centuries. Although many benefits are provided by these manipulations, there can also be unexpected, negative health and environmental outcomes. Environmental biotechnology, then, is all about the balance between the applications that provide for these and the implications of manipulating genetic material. Textbooks address both the applications and implications. Environmental engineering texts addressing sewage treatment and biological principles are often now considered to be environmental biotechnology texts. These generally address the applications of biotechnologies, whereas the implications of these technologies are less often addressed; usually in books concerned with potential impacts and even catastrophic events.\n\n\n"}

Its origins go back to prehistoric Iberian and Roman times, with some remainders in its area. It is located in the Ribera Alta \"comarca\", 40 km south of the provincial capital Valencia. It is the birthplace of the orange growth and its flourishing commerce in the 19th and 20th centuries. Currently, its inhabitants live basically on agriculture and the service sector.\n\nRemains of Neolithic, Iberian and Roman settlements have been found in the area of Carcaixent, although the municipality actually originated from a Muslim farmhouse. King Philip II awarded Carcaixent the title of University in 1576. After upgrading it to Villa Real, the king issued Royal Privileges granting it the right to vote in the Courts of Valencia. Economy and population boomed in Carcaixent in the 18th century thanks to the sound production of silk, although crops were replaced by orange trees in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Carcaixent was awarded the title of city in 1916.\n\n\nThe orange is the fruit made from Spain, through Valencia, and spreading throughout the rest of the world. In Greek mythology the \"Garden of the Hesperides\" is a mythological grove where apples grew tended to by nymphs and a dragon. Hercules, the hero of classical literature, killed the guardian, entered the garden and plucked those golden apples –In later years it was thought that the \"golden apples\" might have actually been oranges, a fruit unknown to Europe before the Middle Ages. Several scholars defend that the etymology of the word comes from the Sanskrit term narang and the Persian word narensh. When Arabs brought orange farming to the Iberian Peninsula, they called the fruits naranjah. The Region of Valencia maintained the orange-farming tradition after the Arabic period, with references to orange trees in the city of Valencia dating back to the 14th century. In fact, there is an Orange Courtyard inside Valencia’s 15th-century Silk Exchange market \"(La Llotja de la Seda)\", a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The first references to commercial orange plantations date back to the 18th century.\n\nAccording to the historical records, in 1781 parish priest Vicente Monzó and two acquaintances, notary and scribe Carlo Maseres and pharmacist Jacinto Bodí, planted the first fields of orange trees in the municipal area of Carcaixent known as Les Basses del Rey. The trees thrived in the land, favoured by the benign Mediterranean climate, and adapted perfectly to Valencian soil both on rain-fed farmland and irrigated land fed by river Júcar, whose extensive irrigation channel distributed fertile water around the whole of the Ribera Alta. In the early 19th century, orange trees gradually started to replace other crops, such as rice, cereal and mulberries, taking over as the main local crop. Wholesale exports of oranges commenced in this century, fuelled by the arrival of the railway that connected Valencia, Xàtiva, Algemesí, La Pobla Llarga, Alzira and Carcaixent (1853). The rail line from Carcaixent to Gandía and Dénia that opened in 1864 continued to operate until the early 1970s. The Carcaixent-Dénia line was one of the oldest narrow rail tracks in mainland Spain.\n\nCarcaixent has developed the Orange route to introduce national and foreign visitors to this interesting and celebrated agricultural, commercial and cultural legacy. The project analyses the history of the fruit, providing information on its origins and on the municipality of Carcaixent’s standing as the birthplace of oranges. Visitors will also learn about parish priest Monzó’s pioneer action, and the different architectural styles used in the construction of orange warehouses from antiquity to present times. The itinerary analyses how oranges have been handled and marketed from the late 18th century to the present.\n\n\n"}

It has long served as a regional tourist destination, and is noted by roller coaster enthusiasts for its classic Blue Streak coaster, which was recently classified as \"historic\" by the American Coaster Enthusiasts group. Conneaut Lake is Pennsylvania's largest natural (glacier) lake and is a popular summer resort for recreational boaters due to there being no horsepower limit on the lake.\n\nConneaut Lake Park was founded in 1892 as Exposition Park by Col. Frank Mantor as a permanent fairground and exposition for livestock, machinery, and industrial products from Western Pennsylvania. Prior to this time, 7 acres of land on which the park is located were purchased in 1877 by Aaron Lynce for use as a boat landing. Col. Mantor's company, the Conneaut Lake Exposition Company, purchased an additional 175 acres of adjacent land, 75 of which were given to Mr. Lynce as payment for his parcel.\n\nDuring its early years, buildings at Exposition Park included a dance hall, a convention hall (for lectures), and a bathhouse. Several of the structures from Lynce's landing were also retained as well as a farmhouse on the property that was converted to a hotel. The park's first mechanical ride, a carousel, opened in 1899, and was soon joined by other rides and a midway.\nOwnership of the park transferred to the Pittsburgh & Shenango Valley Railroad in 1901, during which time several hotels were built on the property. Originally accessible only by boat or train, trolley service was extended to the park in 1907. With its lakefront presence, hotels, and remote location, the park became a popular resort destination. Although many of the park's original buildings were lost in a 1908 fire, new concrete block replacements were constructed, including the Dreamland Ballroom.\n\nThe park was renamed \"Conneaut Lake Park\" in 1920 to reflect a move toward more amusements and rides. Rides added over these years included a Tumble Bug, bumper car ride, and a Figure Eight roller coaster (later renamed The Jack Rabbit). In 1938, the park's signature roller coaster, The Blue Streak, was added.\nIn 1943, a large portion of the Hotel Conneaut was destroyed in a fire. The ghost of Elizabeth, a bride who supposedly died in the fire, is said to now haunt the hotel.\n\nFacing competition from corporate-owned theme parks, the park added a jungle cruise ride and other new attractions in the 1960s. As trolley service had been discontinued, the park's management began to focus on directing automobile traffic to the park. \"Fairyland Forest,\" a walk-through attraction, was constructed across the highway from the park's main entrance. Using a combination of fairy tale characters and animals to help attract families and appeal to young children, many similar attractions existed across the country at that time. Although popular, the area eventually fell into neglect and closed in 1985 and was replaced with Camperland in 1986.\n\nBy the 1990s, a series of ownership changes had taken their toll on the park. A 1974 takeover of the park by Dr. John and Mary Gene Winslow Flynn had saddled the park with $750,000 in debt and expansion slowed. Charles Flynn, long-time associate of New York City mayor Ed Koch and son of Dr. John and Mary Gene decided to leave politics and become actively involved in the family business. Initially this change in management was able to invigorate the park. In the early 1980s, rides such as the Paratrooper and Yo-Yo were added. The waterfront was improved. Along the park's midway, a waterslide tower was added and proved popular.\nFor most of its history, Conneaut Lake Park functioned as a real-life community within an amusement park, as local traffic and waterfront cottages were interspersed with the amusement rides. Park Avenue and Comstock Street, the park's main walking paths, were shared by both patrons and vehicles alike. Although bothersome at times, locals were proud of this arrangement's unique appeal. In an effort to remain competitive, the decision was made to enclose the park for the 1990 season. For the first time in its long history, admission would be charged. In a letter to customers explaining the changes, Flynn stated, \"Traditional parks are dropping like flies and it's time we all realize that we have to take steps now and save our park before its too late to do anything about it.\"\nThe new gated park format, coupled with a rainy summer, led to a decline in attendance. In an effort to raise capital, several rides were sold off. After another disastrous season, a decision was announced: the park, with the exception of the water park, would be leveled and a new family entertainment complex would be built on the property. The new family entertainment complex would focus on special events, concerts, group picnics, and non-ride activities, such as batting cages, mazes, and sports activities. The Blue Streak rollercoaster, which required an estimated $100,000 in repairs, would be scrapped.\n\nAs the park's rides were auctioned off, a group of four local businessmen made a concerted effort to purchase as many of them as possible. This group went on to purchase the park from the Flynn family in an attempt to preserve it as a traditional amusement park. Although nearly $1 million was spent in upgrading and refurbishing the park, attendance continued to dwindle, in part due to a public perception that the park had closed altogether.\n\nIn 1995, the owners filed for bankruptcy and the park did not open. However, by the 1996 season, a group called Summer Resorts, Inc., under the leadership of Gary Harris, completed a purchase of the park. Although Harris arrived at Conneaut Lake with a history of criminal charges, residents were optimistic that the park could be saved under his leadership. The park reopened on July 4, 1996, but new problems arose in 1997 when Harris was convicted of tax evasion. To help extricate himself from his legal difficulties, Harris gave the debt-ridden park to the Conneaut Lake community in 1997, but later filed a lawsuit claiming that he held a 99–year lease on the park grounds and retained ownership of several rides. When that lawsuit was lost in 2001, ownership reverted to a court-appointed trustee.\n\nThe park began the new century under the oversight of a not-for-profit corporation, The Trustees of Conneaut Lake Park. During this time, the park experienced a renewed interest, driven in part by roller coaster and amusement park enthusiast groups. Several of the park's rides, including the Devil's Den and Blue Streak Roller Coaster, were repaired by volunteers. In August 2010, the park received $50,000 in funds from a contest sponsored by Pepsi for use in restoring the Blue Streak.\n\nSeveral fires destroyed buildings on the property, including a 2008 fire that destroyed the Dreamland Ballroom and a fire on August 1, 2013, that destroyed the dockside restaurant and the beach front building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther attractions at the park include these:\n\nSplash City is a water park located in the middle of the park. It contains 3 major attractions; Cliffhanger Falls, Connie Otter's Kiddie Cove, and Otter Creek River Adventure. There are also two decks on the island of the lazy river for sunbathing. They can be accessed by a bridge on the right end of the lazy river. The slides were added in 1986, and the rest of the water park was added in 1991. They operated from 1986-1994, 1996-2006, and then again from 2009-2010. It sat idle between 2011 and 2016. In October 2015, the park announced Splash City would be reopening in 2016. On May 28, 2016, Otter Creek River Adventure reopened to the public. On August 6, 2016, both Cliffhanger Falls and Connie Otter's Kiddie Cove reopened to the public after sitting idle for six years.\n\nOtter Creek Adventure River : A 160,000 gallon lazy river ride, with other water effects such as a mushroom and waterfall.\n\nCliffhanger Falls : A pair of two 415-foot-long water slides. To get to the top, riders climb several sets of stairs, up a 48-foot-tall tower.\n\nConnie Otter's Kiddie Cove : A children's splash pool, with 3 attractions. These include a small water slide in one corner, a waterfall with a walkway behind it in another corner, and a fountain in the center of the pool. It is located directly behind Cliffhanger Falls.\n\nKiddieland is a small enclosed section of the park containing 13 rides specifically for children. It is located behind the Carousel and across from the Witch's Stew and Trabant. It can be accessed from either between the carousel and Blue Streak, or the main entrance across from the Witch's Stew. The original Kiddieland restrooms were destroyed by a fire in 2010. They have since been rebuilt, albeit a different design.\n\nThe following rides are in Kiddieland:\nThe Kiddieland section of the park also offers Pony Rides. This is a large natural grass oval track, not found at many amusement parks anymore. Recently the man who managed the pony track retired after 60+ years. However the pony track continues to operate for a nominal fee.\n\n"}

{"id": "2051068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051068", "title": "Shock advertising", "text": "Shock advertising\n\nShock advertising or Shockvertising is a type of advertising that \"deliberately, rather than inadvertently, startles and offends its audience by violating norms for social values and personal ideals\". It is the employment in advertising or public relations of \"graphic imagery and blunt slogans to highlight\" a public policy issue, goods, or services. Shock advertising is designed principally to break through the advertising “clutter” to capture attention and create buzz, and also to attract an audience to a certain brand or bring awareness to a certain public service issue, health issue, or cause (e.g., urging drivers to use their seatbelts, promoting STD prevention, bringing awareness of racism and other injustices, or discouraging smoking among teens).\n\nThis form of advertising is often controversial, disturbing, explicit and crass, and may entail bold and provocative political messages that challenge the public’s conventional understanding of the social order. This form of advertising may not only offend but can also frighten as well, using scare tactics and elements of fear to sell a product or deliver a public service message, making a \"high impact.\" In the advertising business, this combination of frightening, gory and/or offensive advertising material is known as \"shockvertising\" and is often considered to have been pioneered by Benetton, the Italian clothing retailers which created the line \"United Colors of Benetton\", and its advertisements in the late 1980s (see Benetton below).\n\nShock advertisements can be shocking and offensive for a variety of reasons, and violation of social, religious, and political norms can occur in many different ways. They can include a disregard for tradition, law or practice (e.g., lewd or tasteless sexual references or obscenity), defiance of the social or moral code (e.g., vulgarity, brutality, nudity, feces, or profanity) or the display of images or words that are horrifying, terrifying, or repulsive (e.g., gruesome or revolting scenes, or violence). Some advertisements may be considered shocking, controversial or offensive not because of the way that the advertisements communicate their messages but because the products themselves are \"unmentionables\" not to be openly presented or discussed in the public sphere. Examples of these “unmentionables” may include cigarettes, feminine hygiene products, or contraceptives. However, there are several products, services or messages that could be deemed shocking or offensive to the public. For example, advertisements for weight loss programs, sexual or gender related products, clinics that provide AIDS and STD testing, funeral services, groups that advocate for less gun control, casinos which naturally support and promote gambling could all be considered controversial and offensive advertising because of the products or messages that the advertisements are selling. Shocking advertising content may also entail improper or indecent language, like French Connection's “fcuk” campaign.\n\nAdvertisers, psychiatrists, and social scientists have long debated the effectiveness of shock advertising. Some scientists argue that shocking ads of course evoke stronger feelings among the consumers. One finding suggests “shocking content in an advertisement significantly increases attention, benefits memory, and positively influences behavior.” The same study also shows that consumers are more likely to remember shocking advertising content over advertising content that is not shocking. \nShock advertising could also refer to the usage of emotional appeals such as humor, sex or fear. Humor has for a long time been the most frequently used communication tool within advertising, and according to branch active people it is considered to be the most effective.\n\nThe effects of shock advertising could also be explained by the theory of selective perception. Selective perception is the process by which individual selects, organizes and evaluates stimuli from the external environment to provide meaningful experiences for him- or herself. This means that people focus in certain features of their environment to the exclusion of others. The consumer unconsciously chooses which information to notice and this kind of selection is dependent of different perceptual filters which are based on the consumer’s earlier experiences. One example of this kind of filter is perceptual defense. Perceptual defense is the tendency for people to protect themselves against ideas, objects or situations that are threatening. This means that if a consumer finds a certain kind of advertising content threatening or disturbing, this message will be filtered out. An example of this a heavy smoker who could be filtering out a picture of cancer sick lung since the content could be perceived as disturbing and uncomfortable.\n\nTarget audience: direct-to-consumer advertisements are common in popular magazines, and particularly aimed at women.\n\nYou should also consider long term branding issues if using shock advertising as communication method. Using shocking pictures could affect the way consumers perceive your brand and quality of your product. The ethics is always important to have in mind, and using fear or other strong messages might not always be the best and most effective method to use.\n\nExamples include the use of blood and gore, diseased organs and human body parts, and so on. Thus, it can expose any taboo, but typically has an unnecessarily sexually suggestive image. Benetton Group has had several shocking ads of a priest and a nun kissing, a black woman breast-feeding a white baby, and death row inmates' thoughts. Legal advertising that employs shockvertising would depict or re-enact a car accident, which is now illegal in New York.\n\nThis practice has been compared to extreme sports and lewd behavior, and to the Jerry Springer show.\n\nShockvertising is recognized around the world as a term of art, in Polish, in German, and Dutch.\n\nBenetton has come under particular scrutiny for the use of shock advertisements in its campaigns, leading to public outrage and consumer complaints. However, several of Benetton’s advertisements have also been the subject of much praise for heightening awareness of significant social issues and for “taking a stand” against infringements on human rights, civil liberties, and environmental rights. Benetton’s advertisements have featured images of portions of men’s and women’s bodies with tattoos that say “HIV Positive”, a Black woman breastfeeding a White infant (which could be celebrated as a championing image of racial diversity or raising awareness of racial issues yet was also denounced for its historical connotations when Black women, during slavery, were often required to become caretakers for White children), a priest and a nun leaning to kiss each other, as well as a group of real death row inmates (alluding to issues concerning capital punishment). Other shocking advertisements released by Benetton include an image of a duck covered in oil (addressing issues of oil spillage and the cleanliness of oceans), a man dying of AIDS, a soldier holding a human bone, as well as a newborn infant still attached to its umbilical cord, which \"was intended as an anthem to life, but was one of the most censured visuals in the history of Benetton ads.\" Oliviero Toscani, a photographer for Benetton who contributed to many of its shocking advertisements, said, regarding the advertisement he created of a man dying from AIDS, that he wanted \"to use the forum of poster advertising to make people aware of this [AIDS] tragedy at a time when no-one dared to show AIDS patients.\" \n\nCalvin Klein of Calvin Klein Jeans has also received media attention for its controversial advertisements in the mid-1990s. Several of Calvin Klein's advertisements featured images of teenage models, some \"who were reportedly as young as 15\" in overly sexual and provocative poses. Although Klein insisted that these advertisements were not pornographic, some considered the campaign as a form of \"soft porn\" that was exploitative, shocking, and suggestive. In 1999, Calvin Klein was the subject of more controversy when it aired advertisements of young children who were only wearing the brand's underwear. This \"kiddie underwear ad campaign\" was pulled only one day after it aired as a result of public outlash. A spokesperson from Calvin Klein insisted that these ads were intended \"to capture the same warmth and spontaneity that you find in a family snapshot.\"\n\nIn May 2007, the UK National News reported that the British government banned anti-smoking advertisements that were part of the \"Get Unhooked\" campaign because they caused \"fear and distress\" in children. These public service advertisements featured in magazines, television, and on the internet displayed images of smokers' faces and lips being hooked with fish hooks \"to illustrate how they were 'hooked' on cigarettes.\" Although this campaign received hundreds of complaints citing that the advertisements were offensive, disturbing and violent, the Department of Health was reported as saying that the \"Get Unhooked\" campaign was \"highly effective.\"\n\n\nWoloshin, S., Schwartz, Tremmel, J., & Welch, H.

{"id": "2051100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051100", "title": "Pagan rock", "text": "Pagan rock\n\nPagan rock is music created by (and in some cases for) adherents of one of the many Neopagan and occult traditions that emerged in the middle to late 20th century. In some cases this definition is stretched to include bands embraced by modern Pagans and occult practitioners (Faith and The Muse for example). Bands in this genre will often use pagan and occult imagery and deal with pagan themes.\n\nThe term \"Pagan rock\" differentiates the genre from new-age music, and from the traditional folk music found at many Neopagan events and gatherings. While many bands under this loose category do incorporate rock and roll styles, one can also find bands inspired by gothic rock, medieval music, the darker elements of traditional and folk music, Celtic music, neofolk and neo-classical, darkwave, ethereal, ambient, industrial and experimental music.\n\nIn many ways, the label of \"Pagan rock\" carries with it the same complexities and problems as Christian rock. Like contemporary Christian music, it is more an umbrella term than a cohesive musical genre. The Pagan rock label can include bands like Inkubus Sukkubus and The Moon and the Nightspirit who explicitly state their allegiance to Neopaganism; bands like Abney Park who have Neopagans in the band but do not label themselves as pagan rock, and bands like Unto Ashes who sing songs involving occult and Neopagan themes but avoid publicly labeling their personal belief systems.\n\nThe current conceptions of a \"Pagan rock\" genre lay with two musical strands: first, with the idea of a modern music created by and for Neopagans as typified by the artist Gwydion Pendderwen and, secondly, with the occult themes pursued by early industrial music pioneers Genesis P-Orridge (Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV) and John Balance (Coil, Current 93). Unlike the previous dabbling with occult and romantic pre-Christian themes pursued by rock bands in the 1960s and early 1970s (as typified by artists such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Donovan), these new artists were earnest subscribers to Neopagan religion (in the case of Pendderwen) and ritual magic (in the case of P-Orridge and Balance Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth). The mixture of openly Neopagan lyrics, occultism, and the counter-cultural impulses of the post-punk era would create fertile soil for the inspiration of several bands that would form from the late 1980s forward.\n\nOne of the first bands to be labeled as Pagan rock by the press was the British gothic rock band Inkubus Sukkubus, founded in 1989, who have pagan members or whose songs use pagan imagery and pagan themes. Since the appearance of Inkubus Sukkubus, many gothic rock and darkwave bands have emerged with Neopagan members and lyrical themes.\n\n\n"}

It is a wine and pisco producing area. Vicuña, the main town of the middle valley, was the home of Nobel Laureate poet Gabriela Mistral.\n\nSeveral authors argue that the first community that populated the valleys of Chile's Norte Chico were the Molle people, which initially combined farming with hunting and gathering to become, over time, full-time farmers along with the development burnished red pottery, and did work with stone and copper.\nNotable archaeological sites are Alcohuaz and Cochiguaz where soil and water were available for fruitful farming.\n\nThey were advanced in their use of technology, as evidence of their knowledge of metallurgy and its practical applications shows. In the first stage of their development they worked copper by smelting and hammering it and later used gold and silver alloys, as well as employing techniques of rolling, drawing, and embossing. Later on around 1000 A.D. the Diaguita people arrived in the same area. They were named by the archeologist Ricardo Latcham for their similarities to the Argentine Diaguita. They made contact with the Molle culture, from whom they learned to work with copper and other metals. Their pottery consisted of asymmetric, wide mouth, containers, with a handles and usually rendered with red, black and white geometrical motifs.\nOver time the Diaguita people began to form their own identity and broke free from the influence of the Molle and reached a growing autonomy. Also of interest is the totemic pottery tradition wherein zoomorphic and anthropomorphic vessels were fashioned. Called duck jugs, they consisted of a hand sculptured human-like head coming out of one side and an opening for filling and pouring on the other side, both of which were joined by a curved handle. The whole thing was painted with fine geometric patterns. In Las Placetas near Paihuano, burial sites from the classic period have been identified which demonstrate the use of land for crops and pasturing. Three Diaguita cemeteries were also discovered nearby.\n\nDuring the heyday of the Diaguita, some 550 years ago, the Inca Empire expanded down into present day Chile from Peru, and they were invaded and put under the dominion of the Incas.\n\nInca culture influenced the Diaguitas by improving their agricultural production, care of livestock, and employment of mining and domestic industries such as pottery and textiles. The Incas also provided bowls, jugs with handles on top in animal forms, and new decorative motifs such as triangles and checkerboard stripes.\n\n"}

By the early 1980s he was making a name for himself, winning racing titles at northern California racetracks including a victory in the 1981 California Derby. Baze went on to lead United States thoroughbred horse racing in victories ten times. He has won 36 riding titles at Bay Meadows racetrack in San Mateo, California and 27 titles at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, California.\n\nAfter winning 400 or more races in a year for four consecutive years, Baze got his big break by being honored with a special Eclipse Award in 1995.

It lies roughly halfway between Aberdeen and Bergen, at the eastern end of the Moray Firth basin. Oil extracted from it is piped to Scotland, where it is refined at a refinery on the island of Flotta, in the Orkney Islands, while gas is shipped via the Frigg gas pipeline. In June 1975, the \"Piper Alpha\" oil platform was placed over the field in 144 m of water, secured in place by 24 piles extending 116 m beneath the seabed. The platform was designed for simultaneous drilling and production. Piper Alpha was the site of one of the world's worst oil platform disasters when it was destroyed by an explosion in 1988, with the loss of 167 lives. Piper Bravo was installed in 1992. Talisman Energy acquired a controlling interest in 2000.\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corp., Getty Oil (Britain) Ltd., Thomson North Sea Ltd., and Allied Chemical (North Sea) Ltd., that later transformed into the OPCAL joint venture, obtained an oil exploration licence in 1972 and discovered the Piper oilfield in early 1973 after seismically mapping the area. Oil production started in 1976 with about increasing to . A gas recovery module was installed by 1980. Production declined to by 1988. OPCAL built the Flotta oil terminal in the Orkney Islands to receive and process oil from the Piper, Claymore and Tartan fields, each with its own platform. A diameter main oil pipeline run from \"Piper Alpha\" to Flotta, with a short oil pipeline from the Claymore platform joining it some to the west. The Tartan field also fed oil to Claymore and then onto the main line to Flotta. Separate 46 cm diameter gas pipelines run from Piper to the Tartan platform, and from Piper to the gas compressing platform MCP-01 some to the northwest.\n\nThe field consists of three folded, tilted blocks on the northern edge of the Witch Ground Graben. Production is from the Upper Jurassic Piper Sandstone, a sandstone shelf with a thickness up to 142 m and Oil-water contact ranging in depths from 2195 to 2804 m under the sea. Piper oil most likely originated in the Kimmeridge Shale.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2051142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051142", "title": "Mosasaurus", "text": "Mosasaurus\n\nMosasaurus (; \"lizard of the Meuse River\") is the type genus of the mosasaurs, an extinct group of aquatic squamate reptiles. It lived about 82 to 66 million years ago during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous. The earliest fossils known to science were found as skulls in a chalk quarry near the Dutch city of Maastricht during the late 1700s, which were initially thought to have been the bones of crocodiles or whales. One particular skull discovered sometime around 1780, which was seized during the French Revolutionary Wars for its scientific value and transported to Paris, was famously nicknamed the \"great animal of Maastricht\". In 1808, naturalist Georges Cuvier concluded that it belonged to a giant marine lizard with similarities to monitor lizards but otherwise unlike any animal known today. This concept was revolutionary at the time and helped support the then-developing ideas of extinction. However, Cuvier did not designate a scientific name for the new animal; such task was completed by William Daniel Conybeare in 1822 when he named it the \"Mosasaurus\" in reference to its origin in fossil deposits near the Meuse River.\n\nTraditional interpretations have estimated the maximum length of \"Mosasaurus\" to be up to , making it one of the largest mosasaurs of all time. Its skull, which was either broad or slender depending on the species, was equipped with robust jaws capable of swinging back and forth and strong muscles capable of powerful bites using dozens of large teeth designed for cutting prey. Its tail was long and ended in a paddle-like fluke that bent downwards. \"Mosasaurus\" was a sight-based predator with a poor sense of smell but an excellent vision and had a high metabolic rate that suggests it was warm-blooded, an adaptation found in other mosasaurs but unique among squamates. The classification of \"Mosasaurus\" was historically problematic due to an unclear diagnosis of the type specimen. As a result, over fifty different species have been attributed to the genus in the past. A rediagnosis of the type specimen in 2017 helped clean up this taxonomic mess and confirmed at least five species to be within the genus and another five species still nominally classified within the \"Mosasaurus\" are planned to be reassessed in a future study. Each species was variable with unique anatomical features differentiating them from the robustly-built \"M. hoffmannii\" to the slender and serpentine \"M. lemonnieri\".\n\nFossil evidence suggests that \"Mosasaurus\" inhabited much the Atlantic Ocean and the seaways adjacent to it. Continents that have recovered \"Mosasaurus\" fossils include North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Western Asia, and Antarctica. This distribution encompassed a wide range of oceanic climates including tropical, subtropical, temperate, and subpolar climates. A most common large predator in many parts of these oceans, \"Mosasaurus\" was a dominant genus positioned at the top of the food chain. Its diet would have been able to handle virtually anything and likely preyed on bony fish, sharks, cephalopods, birds, and other marine reptiles including sea turtles and other mosasaurs. It likely preferred to hunt in open water near the surface. In an ecological standpoint, \"Mosasaurus\" probably had a profound impact in the structuring of marine ecosystems; its arrival in some locations such as the Western Interior Seaway in North America has been marked with a complete turnover of faunal assemblages and diversity. \"Mosasaurus\" faced competition with other large predatory mosasaurs such as \"Prognathodon\" and \"Tylosaurus\", which are known to feed to similar prey. Nevertheless, they were able to coexist in the same ecosystems through niche partitioning. That is not to say that conflicts did not arise, as an attack on \"Mosasaurus\" by \"Tylosaurus\" has been documented. Several fossils have also been found that illustrated deliberate attacks on \"Mosasaurus\" individuals by another of the same species. Infighting likely took place in the form of snout grappling, similarily seen in modern crocodiles today.\n\nThe first remains of \"Mosasaurus\" known to science are fragments of a skull discovered in 1764 at a subterranean chalk quarry under Mount Saint Peter, a hill near Maastricht, the Netherlands. It was collected by lieutenant Jean Baptiste Drouin in 1766 and was procured in 1784 by museum director Martinus van Marum for the Teylers Museum at Haarlem. In 1790, van Marum published a description of the fossil, considering it to be a species of \"big breathing fish\" (in other words, a whale) under the classification \"Pisces cetacei\". This skull is still in the museum's collections and is cataloged as TM 7424.\n\nAt some time around 1780, a second more complete skull was discovered at the same quarry. A retired Dutch army physician named Johann Leonard Hoffmann took a keen interest in this specimen, who corresponded with the famous biologist Petrus Camper regarding its identification. Hoffmann, who had previously collected various mosasaur bones in 1770, presumed that the animal was a crocodile. Camper disagreed, and in 1786 he concluded that the remains were from that of an \"unknown species of toothed whale\". Camper published his studies of the fossil that year in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London\", which was the most prestigious scientific journal in the world at the time. As a result, the second skull gained international fame. During this time, the fossil was under the possession of canon Theodorus Joannes Godding, who owned the portion of the land it was discovered in. Godding was struck by its beauty and took every measure to conserve it, eventually displaying it inside a grotto behind his house.\n\nMaastricht, an important Austrian fortress city at the time, was captured during the French Revolutionary Wars by the armies of general Jean-Baptiste Kléber in the November of 1794. Four days after the conquest, the fossil was looted from Godding's possession by soldiers for France due to its international scientific value under the orders of Kléber, which was carried out by political commissar Augustin-Lucie de Frécine. According to an account by Godding's niece and heiress Rosa, Frécine first pretended to be interested in studying the famous remains and corresponded with Godding via letter to arrange a visit to his cottage to personally examine it. Frécine never visited, and instead sent six armed soldiers to forcefully confiscate the fossil under the pretext that he was ill and wanted to study it at his home. Four days after the seizure, the National Convention decreed that the specimen was to be transported to the National Museum of Natural History, France. By the time it arrived at the museum, various parts of the skull were lost. In an 1816 reclamation request, Rosa claimed that she still possessed two of the missing lateral parts of the skull that were not taken by Frécine. However, the fate of these bones is unknown, and some historians believe that Rosa mentioned them in hopes of negotiating indemnity. The French government refused to return the fossil but recompensed Godding in 1827 by exempting him from war taxes.\nThere exists a popular legend regarding Godding's ownership of the specimen and its subsequent acquisition by the French, which is based on the account of geologist Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, who was one of four men that arrived in Maastricht in the January of 1795 with the task of confiscating any public objects of scientific value for France, in his 1798 publication \"Histoire naturelle de la montagne de Saint-Pierre de Maestricht\" (Natural history of the mountain of Saint-Pierre of Maastricht). According to Faujas, Hoffmann was the original owner of the specimen, which he purchased from the quarrymen and helped excavate. When the news of this discovery reached Godding, whom Faujas painted as a malevolent figure, he sought to take possession of the greatly valuable specimen for himself and filed a lawsuit against Hoffmann, claiming his rights as landowner. Due to Godding's ability as canon to influence the court, he was able to force Hoffmann to relinquish the fossil and pay for the costs of the lawsuit. When Maastricht was attacked by the French, the artillerymen spared Godding's house, aware that the famous fossil was housed there. Godding did not know this, and he hid the specimen in a secret location in town. After the city's capture, Faujas personally helped secure the fossil while Frécine offered a reward of 600 bottles of good wine to anyone who would locate and bring to him the skull undamaged. The next day, twelve grenadiers brought the fossil safely to Frécine after assuring full compensation to Godding and collected their promised reward. Historians have found little evidence to back up Faujas' account. For example, there is no evidence that Hoffmann ever possessed the fossil, nor any evidence of a lawsuit between him and Godding, nor any evidence that Faujas had any direct involvement of the fossil's acquisition by the French. Moreover, the existence of more reliable but contradictory accounts suggests that his narrative was mostly made up. Faujas was known to be a notorious liar who commonly embellished his stories, and it is likely that he falsified the story to disguise evidence of looting from a private owner (which was a war crime), to make French propaganda, or to simply impress others. Nevertheless, the legend created by Faujas' embellishment has helped elevate the second skull into one of cultural fame.\n\nUnlike its renowned contemporary, the first skull TM 7424 was not seized by the French after the capture of Maastricht. During the 1795 mission of Faujas and his three colleagues, the collections of Teylers Museum, despite famous, were protected from confiscation. It is possible that the four men were instructed to protect all private collections as \"inviolable\" unless its owner was declared a rebel, forbidding them from seizing the Teylers Museum's collections. However, this protection may have also been due to van Marum's acquaintance with Faujas and André Thouin (another of the four men) since their first meeting in Paris in the July of 1795.\n\nBefore its seizure by the French, the two most popular hypotheses regarding the identification of the second skull were that it represented the remains of either a crocodile or whale, as first argued by Hoffmann and Camper respectively. Hoffmann's identification as a crocodile was viewed by many at the time to be the most obvious answer; there were no widespread ideas of evolution and extinction at the time, and the skull superficially resembled a crocodile. Moreover, among the various mosasaur bones Hoffmann collected in 1770 were phalanx bones which he assembled and placed onto a gypsum matrix. Historians have noted that Hoffmann placed the reconstruction into the matrix in a way that distorted the view of some of the phalanges, creating an illusion that claws are present, which Hoffmann likely took as further evidence of a crocodile. Camper's argument for a whale was based on the second skull's locality, features of the skull itself and other mosasaur bones he obtained, and its anatomical similarities with living animals. First, Camper noted that the skull's jawbones are smooth-textured and its teeth are solid at the root, similar to those in sperm whales but contrary to the crocodile's porous jawbones and hollow teeth. Second, Camper himself obtained mosasaur phalanges which he noted to be significantly different from those of crocodiles and instead suggested paddle-shaped limbs, another cetacean feature. Third, Camper noted the presence of teeth in the pterygoid bone of the skull, which he noted are not present in crocodiles but are present in many species of fish (Camper also thought that the rudimentary teeth of the sperm whale, which he erroneously believed was a species of fish, corresponded to pterygoid teeth). Lastly, Camper pointed out that all fossils from Maastricht are marine fossils, which indicates that the animal represented by the skull must have been a marine animal. Because he erroneously believed that crocodiles are entirely freshwater animals, Camper concluded by process of elimination that the animal could only be a whale.\n\nThe second skull arrived at the National Museum of Natural History, France in 1795, where it is now cataloged as MNHN AC 9648. There, it attracted the attention of more scientists and by this time the specimen was referred to as \"le grand animal fossile des carrières de Maestricht\", or the \"great animal of Maastricht\". One of these scientists was Camper's son Adriaan Gilles Camper. Originally intending to defend his father's arguments, Camper Jr. instead became the first to understand that the crocodile and cetacean hypotheses were both erroneous. Based on his own examinations of MNHN AC 9648 and his father's fossils, he found that their anatomical features were actually more similar with those in squamates and varanoids and concluded that the animal must have been a large marine lizard with varanoid affinities. In 1799, Camper Jr. corresponded his conclusions with the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. Cuvier himself studied MNHN AC 9648, and in 1808 he confirmed Camper Jr.'s identification of a large marine lizard, but as an extinct form unlike any today. The fossil had already become part of Cuvier's first speculations on the possibility of species going extinct, which paved the way for his theory of catastrophism or \"consecutive creations\", one of the predecessors of the theory of evolution. Prior to this, almost all fossils, when recognized as having come from once-living life forms, were interpreted as forms similar to those of the modern day. Cuvier's idea of the Maastricht specimen being a gigantic version of a modern animal unlike any species alive today seemed strange, even to him. In fact, this idea was so important to Cuvier that in 1812 he proclaimed, \"above all, the precise determination of the famous animal from Maastricht seems to us as important for the theory of zoological laws, as for the history of the globe.\" Cuvier justified his concepts by trusting his techniques in the then-developing field of comparative anatomy, which he had already used to identify giant extinct members of other modern groups.\n\nConfusingly, even though the binomial system was well established at the time, Cuvier never designated a scientific name to the new species and for a while, it remained being referred to as the \"great animal of Maastricht\". In 1822, English doctor James Parkinson published a conversation that included a suggestion made by Llandaff dean William Daniel Conybeare to refer to the species as the \"Mosasaurus\", a portmanteau derived from the words \"Mosa\" (the Latin translation for the Meuse River that passed along Mount Saint Peter) and \"saurus\" (the romanization of the Ancient Greek σαῦρος, meaning \"lizard\"), as a temporary name until Cuvier decided on a permanent scientific name. Cuvier never made one; instead, he himself adopted \"Mosasaurus\" as the species' genus and designated MNHN AC 9648 as its holotype. In 1829, English paleontologist Gideon Mantell added the specific epithet \"hoffmannii\" in 1829 in honor of Hoffmann.\n\nThe first possible recorded discovery of a mosasaur in North America was of a partial skeleton described as \"a fish\" in 1804 by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's Corps of Discovery during their famous 1804–1806 expedition across the western United States. First found by seargent Patrick Gass on black sulfur bluffs near the Cedar Island alongside the Missouri River, it consisted of some teeth and a disarticulated vertebral column measuring in length. Four members of the expedition recorded this find in their journals including Clark and Gass. Some parts of the fossil were collected and sent back to Washington, D.C., where it was lost before any proper documentation could be made. Paleontologist Mike Everhart of the Sternberg Museum speculated that the fossil may have been that of a mosasaur, possibly \"Mosasaurus\".\n\nThe earliest description of North American fossils firmly attributed to the genus \"Mosasaurus\" was made in 1818 by naturalist Samuel L. Mitchill of the New York Academy of Sciences (then called the Lyceum of Natural History). The described fossils were of a tooth and jaw fragment recovered from a marl pit from Monmouth County, New Jersey, which Mitchell described as \"a lizard monster or saurian animal resembling the famous fossil reptile of Maestricht\", implying that the fossils had affinities with the then-unnamed \"M. hoffmannii\" holotype from Maastricht. Cuvier was aware of this discovery but doubted whether it belonged to the genus \"Mosasaurus\". Additionally, another foreign naturalist \"unreservedly\" declared that the fossils instead belonged to a species of \"Ichthyosaurus\". In 1830, zoologist James Ellsworth De Kay, another member of the Lyceum, reexamined the specimen. He concluded that it indeed was a species of \"Mosasaurus\" and was considerably larger than the \"M. hoffmannii\" holotype, making it the largest fossil reptile ever discovered in the continent at the time. Whether the two belonged to the same species or not was a question left unanswered until 1838 when German paleontologist Heinrich Georg Bronn designated the New Jersey specimen as a new species and named it \"Mosasaurus dekayi\" in honor of De Kay's efforts. However, the specimen became lost and the taxon was declared a \"nomen dubium\" in 2005. There are some additional fossils from New Jersey that have been historically referred to as \"M. dekayi\", but paleontologists have reidentified them as fossils of \"M. hoffmannii\".\n\nIn the early 1830s, another fossil was discovered near the Big Bend of the Missouri River by a fur trapper. This specimen, which consisted of some vertebrae and a partially complete articulated skull notably missing the end of its snout, was brought back to St. Louis, where it was purchased by an Indian agent as home decoration. This fossil caught the attention of German prince Maximilian of Weid-Neuwied during his 1832-1834 travels in the American West. He purchased the fossil and subsequently sent it to naturalist Georg August Goldfuss of the University of Bonn for research. It was kept in the university's collections under the specimen catalog number RFWUIP 1327. Goldfuss carefully prepared and described the specimen, which he concluded was of a new second species of \"Mosasaurus\" and in 1845 named it \"M. maximiliani\" in honor of Maximilian. Earlier in 1834, however, American naturalist Richard Harlan published a description of a partial fossil snout he obtained from a trader from the Rocky Mountains who found it in the same locality as the Goldfuss specimen. Harlan it thought belonged to a species of \"Ichthyosaurus\" based on perceived similarities with the skeletons from England in features of the teeth and positioning of the nostrils and named it \"Ichthyosaurus missouriensis\". In 1839, he revised this identification after noticing differences in the premaxillary bone and pores between the snouts of the fossil and those of \"Ichthyosaurus\" and instead thought that the fossil actually pertained to a new genus of a frog or salamander-like amphibian, reassigning it to the genus \"Bactrachiosaurus\". For unknown reasons, a publication in the same year from the Société géologique de France documented Harlan alternatively reporting the new genus as \"Bactrachotherium\". Later authors argued that the snout belonged neither to an ichthyosaur nor an amphibian but to a mosasaur, and suspected that it may have been the snout that was missing in the Goldfuss skull. Unfortunately, this could not be confirmed because at the time the fossil snout was lost. But in 2004, it was relocated inside the collections of the National Museum of Natural History, France under the catalog number MNHN 958. It was then found that the snout matched perfectly into the Goldfuss skull, confirming that it was indeed the specimen's missing snout. Because of its earlier description, Harlan's taxon took priority, making the final scientific name \"M. missouriensis\".\nScientists have initially imagined that \"Mosasaurus\" had webbed feet and terrestrial limbs and thus was an amphibious marine reptile capable of both terrestrial and aquatic locomotion. At the time, scientists like Goldfuss argued that known skeletal features of \"Mosasaurus\" at the time such as an elastic vertebral column indicated a walking ability; if \"Mosasaurus\" was entirely aquatic, it would have been better supported by a stiff backbone. But in 1854, German zoologist Hermann Schlegel became the first to prove through anatomical evidence that \"Mosasaurus\" had flippers instead of feet. Using fossils of \"Mosasaurus\" phalanges including the gypsum-encased specimens collected by Hoffmann (which Schlegel extracted from the gypsum, noting that it may have misled previous scientists), he observed that they were broad and flat and showed no indication of muscle or tendon attachment, indicating that \"Mosasaurus\" was incapable of walking and instead had flipper-like limbs for a fully aquatic lifestyle. Unfortunately, Schlegel's evidence was largely ignored by scientists of the day, and it was not until the discoveries of more complete mosasaur fossils in North America by American paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope during the 1870s was Schlegel's hypothesis gained wider acceptance.\n\n\"M. hoffmannii\" and \"M. missouriensis\" are considered to be the best-known and most studied species of the \"Mosasaurus\" genus, but other confirmed species have been described. In 1881, Cope described the third \"Mosasaurus\" species from fossils including a partial lower jaw, some teeth and vertebrae, and limb bones sent to him from a colleague who discovered them in deposits around Freehold Township, New Jersey; these fossils now reside in the American Museum of Natural History as AMNH 1380. Cope declared that the fossils represented a new species of \"Clidastes\" based on their slender build and named it \"Clidastes conodon\". But in 1966, paleontologists Donald Baird and Gerard R. Case reexamined the holotype fossils and found that the species actually belonged under \"Mosasaurus\" and renamed it \"Mosasaurus conodon\". Cope did not provide an etymology for the specific epithet \"conodon\", but etymologist Ben Creisler suggested that it may be a portmanteau meaning \"cone tooth\", which would be derived from the Ancient Greek κῶνος (\"kônos\", meaning \"cone\") and ὀδών (\"odṓn\", meaning \"tooth\"). This is likely in reference to the smooth-surfaced conical teeth characteristic of the species. \nThe fourth species \"M. lemonnieri\" was described in 1889 by Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo from a fairly-complete skull recovered from a phosphate quarry owned by the Solvay S.A. company in the Ciply Basin of Belgium. This skull was one of many fossils donated to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences by Alfred Lemonnier, the director of the quarry. As such, Dollo named the species in his honor. In subsequent years, further mining of the quarry yielded additional well-preserved fossils of the species, some of which were described by Dollo in later papers. These fossils include multiple partial skeletons, which were enough to represent nearly the entire skeleton of \"M. lemonnieri\". All known fossils of the species reside in the collections of the same museum; the holotype skull is cataloged as IRSNB R28. Despite being the most anatomically well-represented among the genus, the species was largely ignored by scientistic literature. Paleontologist Theagarten Lingham-Soliar of Nelson Mandela University suggested two reasons for such neglect. The first reason was that \"M. lemonnieri\" fossils were endemic to Belgium and the Netherlands, areas that have generally not attracted the attention of mosasaur paleontologists. The second reason was that \"M. lemonnieri\" laid in the shadow of its more famous and history-rich congeneric \"M. hoffmannii\". The species has historically been a controversial taxon, and some of the literature that gives attention to \"M. lemonnieri\" argue that it is synonymous with other species. In 1967, research professor Dale Russell of North Carolina State University argued that differences between the fossils of \"M. lemonnieri\" and \"M. conodon\" were too minor to support species-level separation; per the principle of priority, Russell designated \"M. lemonnieri\" as a junior synonym of \"M. conodon\". In a study published in 2000, Lingham-Soliar refuted this through a comprehensive examination of the Royal Belgian Institute's specimens, identifying significant differences in skull morphology. However, he declared that better studies of \"M. conodon\" would be needed to settle the issue of synonymy. Such a study was done in a 2014 paper by Takehito Ikejiri of the University of Alabama and Spencer G. Lucas of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, which examined in detail the skull of \"M. conodon\" and also argued that \"M. conodon\" and \"M. lemonnieri\" are distinct species. Alternatively, paleontologists Eric Mulder, Dirk Cornelissen, and Louis Verding suggested in a 2004 discussion that \"M. lemonnieri\" could actually be juvenile representatives of \"M. hoffmannii\". This was justified by the argument that differences between the two species can only be observable in \"ideal cases\", and that these differences could be explained by age-based variation. However, there are still some differences such as the exclusive presence of fluting in \"M. lemonnieri\" teeth that might indicate the two species being distinct. It has been expressed that better studies are still needed for more conclusive evidence of synonymy.\n\nThe fifth species, \"M. beaugei\", was described in 1952 by French paleontologist Camille Arambourg in part of a large-scale project since 1934 to study and provide paleontological and stratigraphic data of Morocco to phosphate miners such as the OCP Group. The species was described from nine isolated teeth originating from phosphate deposits in the Oulad Abdoun Basin and the Ganntour Basin in Morocco and was named in honor of OCP General Director Alfred Beaugé, who invited Arambourg to partake in the research project and helped provide local fossils. The teeth are now in the National Museum of Natural History, France. One of the teeth, which is cataloged as MNHN PMC 7, was designated as the holotype. In a 2004 study, paleontologists led by Nathalie Bardet of the same museum reexamined Arambourg's teeth and found that only three can be firmly attributed to \"M. beaugei\". Two of the other teeth were described as having variations that may possibly be within the species but were ultimately not referred to \"M. beaugei\", while the remaining four teeth were found to be unrelated to it and of uncertain identity. The study also described the first non-fragmentary \"M. beaugei\" fossils in the form of two well-preserved skulls recovered from the Oulad Abdoun Basin.\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" is a member of the tribe Mosasaurini, which was established in 1967. This placement is shared with the genera Eremiasaurus, Plotosaurus, and Moanasaurus. Since 1997, some scientists argued that the members should be reclassified within the Plotosaurini tribe and abandon the Mosasaurini due to taxonomic issues present at the time. While such a reclassification is not nessesarily invalid, other scientists have opposed this change, arguing that it is unconventional and violates Linnean hierarchy principles. Furthermore, it has been argued that the diagnostics for the Plotosaurini tribe is now outdated. Whatever the case, both tribes are part of the subfamily Mosasaurinae, which in turn belongs to the family Mosasauridae, the family that comprises all mosasaurs. The Mosasauridae ultimately belongs in the order Squamata, which is the order comprising lizards and snakes. In the past, scientists believed that the closest living relatives of mosasaurs were either varanid monitor lizards or snakes based on various shared morphologies. A 2015 phylogenetic analysis on squamates combining morphological and molecular techniques confirmed a dichotomic sister relationship with the latter.\n\nBecause the rules of nomenclature were not solid at the time, scientists of the 19th century did not give \"Mosasaurus\" a proper diagnosis during its first descriptions. As a result, this led to a confusing ambiguity regarding the definition of the genus, which led it to become a wastebasket taxon culminating into a genus that contained as many as fifty different species. In fact, the taxonomic issue was so severe that there were cases of species that were found to be junior synonyms of species that were found to be junior synonyms themselves. This issue was recognized by many scientists at the time, but efforts to clean up the taxonomy of \"Mosasaurus\" suffered hindrance due to a lack of a clear diagnosis. In 1967, Russell published one of the earliest proper diagnoses of \"Mosasaurus\". Although his work is considered incomplete as he worked only on North American representatives and did not examine the \"Mosasaurus\" holotype, Russell was successfully able to significantly revise the taxon and identified eight species he concluded were valid- \"M. hoffmannii\", \"M. missouriensis\", \"M. conodon\", \"M. dekayi\", \"M. maximus\", \"M. gaudryi\", \"M. lonzeensis\", and \"M. ivoensis\". Later scientists would further revise this; \"M. gaudryi\" was reclassified as a tylosaurine in 1990; \"M. maximus\" was synonymized with \"M. hoffmannii\" in 1999 (although some scientists maintain that it is a distinct species); the invalidated species \"M. lemonnieri\" was resurrected in 2000; \"M. ivoensis\" was moved to the genus \"Tylosaurus\" in 2002; and \"M. dekayi\" and \"M. lonzeensis\" became dubious. Moreover, scientists would later describe four additional species from fossils found in the Pacific- \"M. mokoroa\", \"M. hobetsuensis\", \"M. flemingi\", and \"M. prismaticus\".\nIn 2016, Canadian paleontologist Halle Street, under the supervision of Michael Caldwell of the University of Alberta, performed a detailed formal description and diagnosis of the \"Mosasaurus\" holotype for the first time in over two hundred years. From this, she performed a complete taxonomic redescription and reassessment of the genus in her doctoral dissertation that also carefully re-examined the holotypes of all other taxons assigned to \"Mosasaurus\". This concluded with the consideration of the four Pacific species being re-assignable to \"Monanasaurus\" or related genera; the consideration of \"M. conodon\" representatives from the Western Interior Seaway region being re-assignable to \"M. missouriensis\" and representatives from the East Coast being a new genus; the consideration of \"M. beaugei\" being synonymous with \"M. hoffmannii\" and declared a \"nomen dubium\"; the consideration of re-identifying many well-referred \"Mosasaurus\" fossils as different species; the proposed erection of a new \"Mosasaurus\" species named \"M. glycys\"; and the confirmation of three valid species- \"M. hoffmannii\", \"M. missouriensis\", and \"M. lemonnieri\". In a 2017 peer-reviewed publication derived from the dissertation, Street and Caldwell presented premature conclusions that confirmed five valid species based on previous literature- \"M. hoffmannii\", \"M. missouriensis\", \"M. conodon\", \"M. lemonnieri\", and \"M. beaugei\"- and considered the four Pacific species to be possibly valid. \"M. dekayi\" was included in the list of possibly valid taxons without its dubious status addressed, but was described as likely being a synonym of \"M. hoffmannii\". Street and Caldwell refrained from formally reassessing the other possibly valid taxons, stating that they will be reassessed in a large in-depth future study that will revise the taxonomy of the Mosasauridae.\n\nOne of the earliest relevant attempts at an evolutionary study of \"Mosasaurus\" was done by Russell (1967), which proposed that \"Mosasaurus\" evolved from a \"Clidastes\"-like mosasaur, and diverged into two lineages. Of these two hypothesized lineages, one gave rise to \"M. conodon\" and another led to a chronospecies sequence which begins with \"M. ivoensis\" and evolved into \"M. missouriensis\", which then evolved into \"M. maximus\"/\"M. hoffmannii\". However, Russell used a more primitive method of phylogenetics in his study as at the time the works giving rise to the modern field of cladistics were just recently published and had yet to be widely established. In 1997, paleontologist Gorden Bell published the first cladistical study of North American mosasaurs. In it, he incorporated the species \"M. missouriensis\", \"M. conodon\", \"M. maximus\", and an unnamed species and concluded with a partial agreement to Russell (1967). Bell found that \"Mosasaurus\" formed a sister relationship with another group that included \"Globidens\" and \"Prognathodon\", which both descended from a common ancestral group in which \"Clidastes\" is a member of. Bell also found that \"M. conodon\" was the most basal of the \"Mosasaurus\" genus, and that \"M. maximus\" formed a sister relationship with \"Plotosaurus\". Bell's study served as a precedent for later studies that have largely left the systematics of \"Mosasaurus\" unchanged. However, a number of issues from this have been pointed out. First, the genus was severely underrepresented by incorporating only the three North American species \"M. hoffmannii/M. maximus\", \"M. missouriensis\", and \"M. conodon\". By doing so, other important species such as \"M. lemonnieri\", which is one of the most completely known in the genus, were neglected, affecting the results of the phylogenetic analyses. Second, the studies relied on a still unclean and shaky taxonomy of the \"Mosasaurus\" genus due to the lack of a clear holotype diagnosis, which sometimes led to uncomfortable paraphyletic results. Third, there was still a lacking in osteological comparative studies of large mosasaurines including \"Mosasaurus\" at the time, which also hampered accurate results. Street addressed all three problems in her doctoral dissertation and conducted a phylogenetic study with considerably different results, with a peer-reviewed publication derived from it possibly pending.\n\nThe following cladogram on the left (Topology A) is modified from a 2017 multi-method phylogenetic study by scientists led by Tiago Simões using the traditional method of maximum parsimony. The cladogram on the right (Topology B) is modified from Street's 2016 doctoral dissertation that proposes a revision to the Mosasaurini tribe, with proposals for numerous new taxons and recombinations. It must be noted that Street (2016) is not a peer-reviewed publication, and was thus not cited in Simões \"et al.\" (2017).\n\nTopology A: Maximum parsimony by Simões \"et al.\" (2017)\n\nTopology B: Proposed revision of Mosasaurini by Street (2016)\n\nA popular method used to determine the total length of mosasaur individuals is by measuring the length of the skull or lower jaw, which could then be used to yield the total length using a skull or lower jaw to body proportion. The most well-known proportion for \"M. hoffmannii\" is one recorded by Russell (1967), which equates the ratio between the lower jaw and the body being 1:10, although no rationale is given for this. When applying the ratio in the same study, Russell yielded a total length of using the largest reliable skull in his access. However, larger fossils are known, most notably a large \"M. hoffmannii\" lower jaw found in the Russian city of Penza in 1927. When it was re-examined in a 2014 study, it was found to measure in length and thus yielded a total length of approximately using Russell's proportions. Earlier in 1995, Lingham-Soliar also applied Russell's proportions on a partial lower jaw measuring that reportedly \"is reliably estimated at 1600 mm\" and yielded a total length of .\n\nAn alternative ratio used to determine the total length of \"Mosasaurus\" is one proposed in 2014 by a study led by paleontologist Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, which aimed to be more consistent with the proportions of related genera. Based on a near-complete skeleton of the mosasaurine and \"Mosasaurus\" relative \"Prognathodon overtoni\", this proportion is of a 1:7 skull to body ratio. When applied to a \"Mosasaurus\" snout of comparable size to that from a skull measuring in length, the study yielded a total length of at least . When applied to the Penza specimen, it would yield a total length of approximately .\n\nA body proportion ratio has also been recorded for \"M. lemonnieri\". This ratio was recorded by Dollo in 1892 based on measurements of a partial skeleton of \"M. lemonnieri\" that consists of, but not limited to, a full-length skull and a nearly-complete partially articulated vertebral column; this skeleton is currently cataloged as IRSNB 3119. It equates the ratio between the skull and body being roughly 1:11. When applying the ratio on various \"M. lemonnieri\" fossils in his access, Dollo yielded lengths ranging between in total length. The largest known skull of \"M. lemonnieri\" is currently IRSNB 3189, which measures approximately in length. When applying Dollo's ratio, this yields a total body length of around .\n\nThe skulls of \"M. missouriensis\", \"M. conodon\", and \"M. beaugei\" are smaller in length than that of \"M. hoffmannii\" and large \"M. lemonnieri\". Large individuals of \"M. missouriensis\" typically have skull lengths around or exceeding , with one skull from the collections of the University of Kansas cataloged as KUVP 1034 being measured at in length. \"M. conodon\" is smaller, with its largest known skull measuring around in length. The largest skull of \"M. beaugei\" described in scientific literature is incomplete but is estimated to have measured in length.\n\nThe features of teeth in \"Mosasaurus\" are variable across species but characteristics that unify the genus include highly prismatic surfaces (prism-shaped enamel circumference), two opposite cutting edges, and occupation within the cutting guild of mosasaur dentition. \"Mosasaurus\" teeth are considered to be large and robust with the exception of in \"M. conodon\" and \"M. lemonnieri\", which instead have more slender teeth. The cutting edges of \"Mosasaurus\" can range from having to lacking serrations depending on the species. The cutting edges in \"M. hoffmannii\" and \"M. missouriensis\" are finely serrated, while \"M. conodon\" and \"M. lemonnieri\" lack serrations. The cutting edges in \"M. beaugei\" are neither serrated nor smooth, but instead possesses minute crenulations. The number of prisms, or flat sides on a prismatic tooth's circumference, in \"Mosasaurus\" teeth can slightly vary between tooth types and general patterns differ between species- \"M. hoffmannii\" had two to three prisms on the labial side (the side facing outwards) and no prisms on the lingual side (the side facing the tongue); \"M. missouriensis\" had four to six labial prisms and eight lingual prisms; \"M. lemonnieri\" had eight to ten labial prisms; \"M. beaugei\" had three to five labial prisms and eight to nine lingual prisms.\n\nLike all mosasaurs, \"Mosasaurus\" had four types of teeth that correspond to their placement at their namesake jaw bones. On the upper jaw, there were three types and were the premaxillary teeth, maxillary teeth, and pterygoid teeth. On the lower jaw, only one type, the dentary teeth, were present. A unified dental formula representing the \"Mosasaurus\" genus is . This means that in each jaw row from front to back \"Mosasaurus\" had: two premaxillary teeth, twelve to sixteen maxillary teeth, and eight to sixteen pterygoid teeth on the upper jaw and fourteen to seventeen dentary teeth on the lower jaw. The number of teeth in the maxillary, pterygoid, and dentary positions vary between species and sometimes even individuals- \"M. hoffmannii\" had fourteen to sixteen maxillary teeth, fourteen to fifteen dentary teeth, and eight pterygoid teeth; \"M. missouriensis\" had fourteen to fifteen maxillary teeth, fourteen to fifteen dentary teeth, and eight to nine pterygoid teeth; \"M. conodon\" had fourteen to fifteen maxillary teeth, sixteen to seventeen dentary teeth, and eight pterygoid teeth; \"M. lemonnieri\" had fifteen maxillary teeth and fourteen to seventeen dentary teeth; \"M. beaugei\" had twelve to thirteen maxillary teeth and fourteen to sixteen dentary teeth. One indeterminate specimen of \"Mosasaurus\" similar to \"M. conodon\" from the Pembina Gorge State Recreation Area in North Dakota was found to have an unusual count of sixteen pterygoid teeth, which is a count far greater than those in known species.\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" possessed a thecodont dentition, meaning that the roots of its teeth were deeply cemented within the jaw bone. \"Mosasaurus\" did not utilize permanent teeth and were instead constant shedders. Replacement teeth develop within the roots of the original tooth inside a resorption pit through an eight-stage process that is autapomorphic, or entirely unique, to mosasaurs. The first stage is characterized by the mineralization of a small tooth crown developed elsewhere that descends into the resorption pit by the second stage. In the third stage, the developing crown firmly cements itself within the resorption pit and grows in size; by the fourth stage, it is of the same size as the crown in the original tooth. Stages five and six are characterized by the development of the replacement tooth's root in where stage five sees a vertical development of the root and stage six sees the root expand in all directions and to the point that the replacement tooth becomes exposed and actively pushes on the original tooth. The seventh stage sees the original tooth being shed and the now-independent replacement tooth beginning to anchor itself into the vacancy. By the eighth and final stage, the replacement tooth has grown to firmly anchor itself. Chemical studies conducted on a \"M. hoffmannii\" maxillary tooth approximated the duration of the deposition of odontoblast, the cells responsible for the formation of dentin, to take 511 days and the full development of dentin to take 233 days.\n\nThe skull of \"Mosasaurus\" is akin to a large cone that tapered off to a short and conical rostrum that extended only a little beyond the premaxillary teeth. Above the gum line in both jaws, a single-file pattern of small pits known as foramina which hold the terminal branches of jaw nerves line parallel to the jawline. A number of foramina are also present along the rostrum in a pattern similar to that found in skulls of \"Clidastes\". The upper jaws in most species are robustly built and are broad and deep except in \"M. conodon\", which are slender. The premaxillary bar, the long portion of the premaxillary bone extending posteriorly to the premaxillary teeth, is very robust and does not constrict near the middle like in typical mosasaur premaxillary bars. The external nares are moderately sized, measuring around 21–24% of the skull length in \"M. hoffmannii\". They are positioned more posteriorly than any other mosasaur and begin above the fourth or fifth maxillary teeth; this feature is only exceeded in \"Goronyosaurus\".\n\nThe palatal complex, which consisted of the pterygoid bones, palatine bone, and nearby bones of other processes, is tightly packed, which provided greater cranial stability. The neurocranium provided a brain that was narrow and relatively small compared to other mosasaurs. For contrast, the braincase of the mosasaur \"Plioplatecarpus marshi\" provided for a brain around twice the size of that in \"M. hoffmannii\" while being a species being only half the length of the latter. Spaces within the braincase providing for the occipital lobe and cerebral hemisphere are narrow and shallow, suggesting that such brain parts were relatively small. Moreover, the parietal foramen in \"Mosasaurus\", which is associated with the parietal eye, is very small and the smallest in the Mosasauridae family. The trachea likely stretched from the esophagus to below the back end of the mandible's coronoid process, where it split into smaller pairs of bronchi that extend parallel with each other.\n\nThe most complete skeleton of \"Mosasaurus\" has seven vertebrae in the neck, thirty-eight vertebrae in the back, eight vertebrae in the pygals, and sixty-eight caudal vertebrae in the tail. All species of \"Mosasaurus\" have seven neck vertebrae, but other vertebral counts vary between them. Various partial skeletons of \"M. conodon\", \"M. hoffmannii\" (\"M. maximus\"), and \"M. missouriensis\" suggest that \"M. conodon\" likely had up to thirty-six back vertebrae and nine pygal vertebrae; \"M. hoffmannii\" likely up to thirty-two back vertebrae and ten pygal vertebrae; and \"M. missouriensis\" around thirty-three back vertebrae, eleven pygal vertebrae, and at least seventy-nine caudal vertebrae. \"M. lemmonieri\" had the most vertebrae in the genus, with up to around forty back vertebrae, twenty-two pygal vertebrae, and ninety caudal vertebrae. The rib cages of \"Mosasaurus\" are unusually deep and form an almost perfect semicircle, giving it a barrel-shaped chest. Extensive cartilage likely connected the ribs with the sternum, which would have facilitated breathing movements and compression when in deeper waters. The texture of the bones is virtually identical with that in modern whales, which implies \"Mosasaurus\" enjoyed a high range of aquatic adaptability and neutral buoyancy seen in cetaceans.\n\nThe tail was bilobed and hypocercal, meaning that the tail vertebrae extended toward the lower lobe. The centra of the tail vertebrae gradually shorten around the center of the tail and lengthen behind the center, suggesting rigidness around the tail center and excellent flexibility posterior to it. Like most advanced mosasaurs, the tail bent slightly downwards as it approached the center, but this bend was at a small degree with little offset from the body. \"Mosasaurus\" also had large haemal arches in the caudal vertebrae that would bend near the middle of the tail; this contrasts with the reduction of haemal arches in other marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs. These and other features supported a large and powerful paddle-like fluke in \"Mosasaurus\".\n\nThe forelimbs of \"Mosasaurus\" are wide and robust. The scapula and humerus are fan-shaped and wider than tall. The radius and ulna are short, but the former is taller and larger than the latter. The paddle is supported with five sets of finger-like metacarpals and phalanges with the fifth being shorter and offset from the rest. The overall structure of the paddle is compressed, similar to that in \"Plotosaurus\", and is well-suited for utilization for faster swimming. In the hindlimbs, the paddle is supported with four sets of digits. The ilium is rod-like and slender; in \"M. missouriensis\", it is around 1.5 times longer than the femur. The femur itself is about twice as long than it is wide and ends in a pair of distinct articular facets that meet at around 120°.\n\nMuch of the knowledge on the musculature and mechanics of the \"Mosasaurus\" head are largely based on Lingham-Soliar's 1995 study on \"M. hoffmannii\" skulls. Because soft tissue like muscles do not easily fossilize, reconstruction of the head musculature is largely based on the properties of the skull, the nature of muscle scarring on the skull, and the musculature in extant monitor lizards.\n\nIn modern lizards, the mechanical build of the skull is characterized by a four-pivot geometric structure in the cranium that allows flexible movement of the jaws, possibly to allow the animal to better position them when hunting and prevent deflection, which is the positioning of a prey in a way that increases its chance of escape from an attacking predator. However, the skull of \"M. hoffmannii\" is characterized by a rigid three-pivot geometric cranial structure, which indicates that its jaw mechanics were much different than modern lizards. Instead, these cranial structures are united into strong interlocking sutures that can resist compression and shear forces caused by a downward thrust of the lower jaw muscles or an upward thrust of prey. This rigid but highly shock-absorbent structure of the cranium likely functioned to allow a powerful bite force during prey seizure.\n\nLike all mosasaurs, The lower jaws of \"Mosasaurus\" were capable of adduction, allowing it to swing back and forth. In many mosasaur species such as \"Prognathodon\" and \"M. lemonnieri\", this function mainly served to allow ratchet feeding, in which the pterygoid and jaws would \"walk\" captured prey into the mouth like a conveyor belt. However, especially compared to that in \"M. lemonnieri\", the pterygoid teeth in \"M. hoffmannii\" are relatively small, which indicates ratchet feeding was rather insignificant when hunting and feeding. Rather, \"M. hoffmannii\" likely swallowed its prey and used jaw adduction to assist in hard biting during prey seizure. The \"magnus adductor\" muscles, one of the muscles attaching the lower jaw to the cranium and has a major role in biting function, are massive, indicating that \"M. hoffmannii\" was capable of enormously powerful bite forces. The long, narrow, and heavy nature of the lower jaws and attachment of tendons at the coronoid process would have allowed quick opening and closing of the mouth with little energy input underwater, which may have contributed to the powerful bite force of \"M. hoffmannii\" and suggests that it would not have needed the strong \"magnus depressor\" muscles (jaw-opening muscles) seen in some plesiosaurs.\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" swam using its tail. The swimming style varied between species; \"M. hoffmannii\" utilized a sub-carangiform swimming style, which is best seen today in mackerels, while \"M. lemonnieri\" was more serpentine and likely moved in a more anguilliform eel-like style. Its elongated paddle-like limbs functioned as a hydrofoil for maneuvering the animal. The paddle's steering function was enhanced by large muscle attachment from the outwards-facing side of the humerus to the radius and ulna and an enhanced ability of pronation allowed by modified joints. However, the powerful forces resulting from utilization of the paddles may have sometimes resulted in bone damage, as evidenced by a \"M. hoffmannii\" ilium with great separation damage from the bone's head to stem likely caused by frequent shearing forces at the articulation joint.\n\nThe tissue structure of \"Mosasaurus\" bones suggests that it had a metabolic rate much higher than modern squamates and its basal metabolic rate was intermediate between that in the leatherback sea turtle and \nin ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. In order to keep up with its high metabolic requirements, \"Mosasaurus\" was likely endothermic, maintaining a constant temperature of warm blood independent of the external enviornment. There is no direct evidence specific to the genus, but studies on the biochemistry of related endothermic mosasaur genera concluded that endothermy was likely present in all mosasaurs. Possession of such thermoregulation, which is unique among squamates, would have given several advantages to \"Mosasaurus\", including increased stamina when foraging larger areas and pursuing prey. Endothermy may have also been a factor allowing \"Mosasaurus\" to thrive in the subpolar climates of locations such as Antarctica, where ocean temperatures during the Maastrichtian had lowest annual averages of around with sea surface temperatures possibly dropping to below freezing.\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" had relatively large eye sockets with large sclerotic rings occupying much of the socket's diameter, which suggests that it had good vision. The position of these eye sockets are located at the sides of the skull, preventing good binocular vision but alternatively allowing excellent processing of a two-dimensional environment. This may have been particularly useful for \"Mosasaurus\", which likely lived near the surface in open waters where three-dimensional environments are virtually nonexistent.\n\nBrain casts made from the cranium of \"Mosasaurus\" skulls show that the olfactory bulb and vomeronasal organ, which controls the function of smell, are poorly developed and lack a number of components in \"M. hoffmannii\". This indicates that the species had an extremely poor sense of smell. In \"M. lemonnieri\", these olfactory organs, although still small, are better developed and has some of the components that \"M. hoffmannii\" lack, suggesting that it had a more improved sense of smell. The lack of strength in smell suggests that olfaction was not particularly important in \"Mosasaurus\"; instead, other senses like a well-developed sense of vision may have been more useful for the mosasaur.\n\nIt is likely that \"Mosasaurus\" was viviparous, meaning that it gave live birth like modern mammals today. There is no direct evidence specific for the genus, but there is such that at least a number of mosasaurs gave live birth; examples include a skeleton of a pregnant basal mosasauroid \"Carsosaurus marchesetti\", a \"Plioplatecarpus primaevus\" fossil associated with fossils of two mosasaur embryos, and fossils of newborn \"Clidastes\" from pelagic deposits. Such fossil records, along with a total absence of any evidence suggesting external egg-based reproduction, indicates the likeliness of \"Mosasaurus\" vivaparity. Moreover, microanatomical studies on bones of juvenile \"Mosasaurus\" and related genera have found their bone structures are comparable to that in adults and did not exhibit bone mass increase (which is associated with a lifestyle in shallow water), signifying that \"Mosasaurus\" were already efficient swimmers and lived a fully functional lifestyle in open water at a very young age. This indicates that \"Mosasaurus\" was likely born precocial in pelagic settings and did not utilize nursery areas to birth and raise young. However, a number of localities in Europe and South Dakota have yielded concentrated assemblages of juvenile \"M. hoffmannii\", \"M. missouriensis\" and/or \"M. lemonnieri\". These localities are solely shallow ocean deposits, suggesting that juvenile \"Mosasaurus\" may have still utilized shallow waters.\n\nThere is direct evidence that \"Mosasaurus\" engaged in aggressive and lethal intraspecific combat with other individuals of its kind. One particular fossil is of a partial \"M. conodon\" skeleton consisting of multiple cuts, breaks, and punctures on various bones, especially in the posterior portions of the skull and neck, and a tooth from another \"M. conodon\" individual piercing through the quadrate bone. No injuries on the fossil show signs of healing, signifying that the mosasaur was killed by its attacker through a fatal blow in the skull. Another direct example is of a \"M. missouriensis\" skeleton with a tooth from another \"M. missouriensis\" embedded in the lower jaw underneath the eye. In this case, there were signs of healing around the wound, signifying that the victim survived the ordeal. There are multiple other known fossils of \"Mosasaurus\" skulls that show signs of severe injuries, some leading to infections and likely fatal, that were likely perpetrated by an attack by another \"Mosasaurus\", although another possible explanation for some of these injuries include attempted biting on hard turtle shells. If these injuries were indeed the result of an intraspecific attack, then it is notable that the majority of injuries concentrate in the skull. Modern crocodiles commonly attack other crocodiles by grappling their opponent's snout using their jaws, and it has been hypothesized that the concentration of such injuries in the skull indicates that \"Mosasaurus\" also employed snout-grappling during intraspecific combat. Another notability is that many of the fossils with injuries possibly attributable to intraspecific combat are of juvenile or sub-adult \"Mosasaurus\", giving the possibility that attacks on smaller, weaker individuals may have been more common. However, the attacking mosasaurs of the \"M. conodon\" and \"M. missouriensis\" specimens were likely similar in size with the victims. Some scientists have speculated the possibility that \"Mosasaurus\" may have even occasionally engaged in cannibalism as a result of intraspecific aggression.\n\nWhile there is little knowledge of the feeding habits of \"Mosasaurus\", paleontologists generally agree that it was likely an active predator that preyed on a variety of marine animals. It is unlikely that \"Mosasaurus\" was a scavenger as it had a poor sense of smell, which an excellent sense of such is essential for a successful scavenger lifestyle. \"Mosasaurus\" was among the largest marine animals of its time, and with its large robust cutting teeth, larger members of the genus would have been able to handle virtually anything. Large tooth marks on scutes of the giant sea turtle \"Allopleuron hoffmanni\" and fossils of re-healed fractured jaws in \"M. hoffmannii\" also demonstrate the capabilities of the feeding savagery of \"Mosasaurus\". Fauna that was likely preyed on by the mosasaur includes bony fish, sharks, cephalopods, birds, and marine reptiles such as other mosasaurs and turtles. \"M. hoffmannii\" likely hunted near the ocean surface as an ambush predator, using its large two-dimensionally adapted eyes to more effectively spot and capture prey. Chemical and structural data in the fossils of \"M. lemonnieri\" and \"M. conodon\" suggests that they may have also hunted at deeper waters.\n\nCarbon isotope studies on fossils of multiple \"M. hoffmannii\" individuals have found extremely low values of δC, and are the lowest in all mosasaurs. There are several implications for δC levels in the feeding ecology of mosasaurs. The relationship between δC levels in mosasaurs and their trophic levels are negatively correlated, meaning that mosasaurs with lower δC values tend to occupy higher trophic levels. One factor for this is dietary; a diet in prey of high lipid contents such as sea turtles and other large marine reptiles can lower δC values. With \"M. hoffmannii\"'s low δC levels, this suggests that it likely fed on such prey and reinforces its likely position as an apex predator.\n\nCurrently, there is only one known example of a \"Mosasaurus\" preserved with stomach contents; this being an exquisitely-preserved partial skeleton of a small \"M. missouriensis\" dated about 75 Ma. Analysis of its stomach contents have found remains of a long fish. This fish is much longer than the length of the mosasaur's skull, which was measured at in length, confirming that \"M. missouriensis\" was macrophagous and consumed prey larger than its head by dismembering and consuming bits at a time. The presence of other large mosasaurs specialized in robust prey coexisting with the species strongly suggests that \"M. missouriensis\" likely specialized more on cutting-based prey to ensure niche partitioning.\n\nThere is a possibility that \"Mosasaurus\" may have taught their offspring how to hunt, evidenced by a fossil nautiloid \"Argonautilus catarinae\" with bite marks from two conspecific mosasaurs, one being from a juvenile and the other being from an adult. The positioning of both bite marks are at the direction that the nautiloid would have been facing, indicating that it was incapable of escaping and was thus already sick or dead during the attacks. It is possible that this phenomenon was from a parent mosasaur teaching its offspring that cephalopods were an alternate source of prey and how to hunt one, demonstrating with a sick or dead example. An alternate possible explanation is that the bite marks are from one individual mosasaur that lightly bit the nautiloid at first, then proceeded to bite again with greater force; but differences in tooth spacing between both bites indicate different jaw sizes and makes the first hypothesis more likely. Analysis of the tooth marks have concluded that the mosasaurs were either \"Mosasaurus\" or \"Platecarpus\".\n\nWith its evidently savage lifestyle, there are a number of known fossils of \"M. hoffmannii\" that exhibit severe physically-inflicted damage. Two specimens from the Museum of Natural Sciences of Belgium cataloged as IRSNB R25 and IRSNB R27 with fractures and other pathologies in their dentary bones have been described by Lingham-Soliar in a 2004 study. The specimen IRSNB R25 preserves a complete fracture near the sixth tooth socket. Extensive amounts of bony callus almost overgrowing the tooth socket are present around the fracture along with various osteolytic cavities, abscess canals, foramen in a trigeminal nerve, and inflamed erosions signifying severe bacterial infection. There are two finely ulcerated scratches on the bone callus, which may have been developed as part of the healing process. Specimen IRSNB R27 has two fractures; one has almost fully healed and the other is an open fracture with nearby teeth broken off, which is likely associated with the dentary fracture. The fracture is covered with a nonunion formation of bony callus with shallow scratch marks and a large pit connected to an abscess canal. Both specimens show signs of deep bacterial infection alongside the fractures, some possibly have spread into nearby damaged teeth and caused tooth decay, which may have entered deeper tissue from prior post-traumatic or secondary infections. However, the conditions of the dentaries anterior to the fractures in both specimens are in good condition, indicating that the arteries and trigeminal nerves have evidently not been damaged; if that were to be the case, those areas would have become necrotic due to a cutting off of blood supply. This suggests that the individuals may have had an efficient process of immobilization of the fracture during healing, which likely helped prevent damage to vital blood vessels and nerves. This, along with signs of healing, also signifies that the fractures were not imminently fatal. The cause of these injuries cannot be held for certain, but two possibilities exist. One possibility may have been collateral damage from a bite on a hard surface such as a turtle shell, which would have caused intensified stress on the jawbones. Another possibility is damage inflicted by another individual during intraspecific combat. The pit in IRSNB R27 has been described to resemble a tooth mark, which gives the possibility that such was the location of an attack by another mosasaur.\n\nIn 2006, paleontologists led by Anne Schulp of Utrecht University published a study describing a fossil quadrate of \"M. hoffmannii\" with a massive chronic infection. The bone was extensively damaged, having multiple unnatural openings and an estimated half of a liter of bone tissue destroyed. It is likely that this was the result of a severe case of osteomyelitis initiated by septic arthritis, which progressed to the point that a large portion of the quadrate was reduced to voids of abscess. Remarkably, extensive amounts of bone reparative tissue were also present, suggesting that the infection and subsequent healing process may have progressed for a few months. Such severity of bone infection would have likely been tremendously painful and severely hamper the mosasaur's ability to use its jaws, and the location of the infection would have also had the possibility of interfering with respiration. Considering that the individual was able to survive such conditions for an extended period of time, it is likely that it switched to a foraging-type diet subsidizing on soft-bodied prey such as squid that could be swallowed whole to minimize usage of the jaws. The cause of the infection currently remains speculative, but if it were to be a result of an intraspecific attack then it is possible that one of the openings on the quadrate may have been the point of entry for an attacker's tooth from which the infection entered.\n\nAvascular necrosis has been reported by many studies to be invariably present in \"M. lemonnieri\" and \"M. conodon\". This condition is a common result of decompression illness, caused by bone damage from interference by formation of gaseous nitrogen bubbles that were produced from inhaled air decompressed during deep or repetitive diving. This indicates that both \"Mosasaurus\" species may have either been frequent deep-divers or repetitive divers. Paleontologist Agnete Weinreich Carlsen of the University of Copenhagen commented that it would be frugal to consider the appearance of such conditions being due to non-adaptation in the animal's original state, as fossils of other mosasaurs that also invariably suffer avascular necrosis show evidence of developed eardrums that protected itself from rapid changes in pressure.\n\nNot including the Pacific species unassessed by Street and Caldwell (2017) and identified as separate genera in Street (2016), \"Mosasaurus\" was a transatlantic mosasaur with its fossils having been found in deposits at or nearby both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. These localities include the Midwestern and East Coast of the United States, Canada, Europe, Turkey, Russia, the Levant, the African coastline from Morocco to South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, and Antarctica. During the Late Cretaceous, they made up the three seaways inhabited by \"Mosasaurus\"; these are the Atlantic Ocean, Western Interior Seaway, and Mediterranean Tethys. Multiple oceanic climates encompass the seaways including tropical, subtropical, temperature, and subpolar climates. The wide range of oceanic climates, in turn, yield a large diversity of fauna that coexisted with \"Mosasaurus\".\n\nThe Mediterranean Tethys during the Maastrichtian was located in what is now Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In recent studies, the confirmation of paleogeographical affinities extends this range to areas across the Atlantic including Brazil and the East Coast state of New Jersey. It is geographically subdivided into two provinces that respectively include the northern and southern Tethyan margins. From an ecological view, the two mosasaurs \"Mosasaurus\" and \"Prognathodon\" appear to be the dominant taxons in the entire seaway, being very widespread and ecologically diversified throughout the Mediterranean Tethys. The northern Tethyan margin is located around the paleolatitudes of 30-40°N, consisting of what is now the European continent, Turkey, and New Jersey. At the time, Europe was a scattering of islands with most of the modern continental landmass being underwater. The northern Tethyan margin provides a warm-temperate climate that is dominated by mosasaurs and sea turtles. \"M. hoffmannii\" and \"Prognathodon sectorius\" are the dominant species in this province. However, other \"Mosasaurus\" species such as \"M. lemonnieri\" have been found to be the dominant species in certain areas such as Belgium, where its occurrences greatly outnumber that of other large mosasaurs. Other mosasaurs that have been found in the European side of the northern Tethyan margin include smaller mosasaurs such as \"Halisaurus\", \"Plioplatecarpus\", and \"Platecarpus\"; the shell-crusher \"Carinodens\", and larger mosasaurs of similar trophic levels including \"Tylosaurus bernardi\" and four other species of \"Prognathodon\". Sea turtles such as \"Allopleurodon hoffmanni\" and \"Glyptochelone suickerbuycki\" also dominated the area and other marine reptiles including undetermined elasmosaurs have been occasionally known. Marine reptile assemblages in the New Jersey region of the province are generally equivalent with that in Europe; mosasaur fauna are quite similar but differ in the absence of \"M. lemonnieri\", \"Carinodens\", \"Tylosaurus\", and certain species of \"Halisaurus\" and \"Prognathodon\" and the exclusive presence of \"M. conodon\" and some species of \"Halisaurus\" and \"Prognathodon\". Many species of sharks such as \"Squalicorax\", \"Cretalamna\", \"Serratolamna\", and sand sharks, as well as bony fish such as \"Cimolichthys\", the saber-toothed herring \"Enchodus\", and the swordfish \"Protosphyraena\" are represented in the northern Tethyan margin.\n\nThe southern Tethyan margin is located along the equator between 20°N and 20°S, resulting in warmer tropical climates as typical in the province. Located around what is now Africa, Arabia, the Levant, and Brazil, seabeds bordering the cratons in Africa and Arabia provided vast shallow marine environments. Such waters were also dominated by mosasaurs and marine side-necked turtles. Of the mosasaurs, \"Globidens phosphaticus\" is the characteristic species of the southern province; in the African and Arabian domain, \"Halisaurus arambourgi\" and \"'Platecarpus' ptychodon\" were also the dominant mosasaurs. \"Mosasaurus\" was not well-represented; the distribution of \"M. beaugei\" was restricted to Morrocco and Brazil and isolated teeth from Syria suggested a possible presence of \"M. lemonnieri\", although \"M. hoffmannii\" has some presence throughout the province. Other mosasaurs from the southern Tethyan margin include the enigmatic \"Goronyosaurus\", the shell-crushers \"Igdamanosaurus\" and \"Carinodens\", \"Eremiasaurus\", four other species of \"Prognathodon\", and various other species of \"Halisaurus\". Other marine reptiles such as the marine monitor lizard \"Pachyvaranus\" and sea snake \"Palaeophis\" are known there. Aside from \"Zarafasaura\" in Morocco, plesiosaurs were scarce. As a tropical area, bony fish such as \"Enchodus\" and \"Stratodus\" and various sharks were common throughout the southern Tethyan margin.\n\nMany of the earliest fossils of \"Mosasaurus\" were found in Campanian deposits in North America, including what was once the Western Interior Seaway, an inland sea that flowed through what is now the central United States and Canada and connected the Arctic Ocean to the modern-day Gulf of Mexico. The region was rather shallow for a seaway, having a depth of about below the surface at its deepest. Extensive drainage from the two neighboring Appalachia and Laramidia continents brought in vast amounts of sediments, and together with the formation of a nutrient-rich deepwater mass from the mixing of continental freshwater, Arctic waters from the north, and warmer saline Tethyan waters from the south, it created a warm and highly-productive seaway that supported a rich diversity of marine life. In fact, many of the most famous marine assemblages of the Late Cretaceous are from deposits in the Western Interior Seaway. However, fossil assemblages throughout these deposits suggest a complete faunal turnover by the time \"M. missouriensis\" and \"M. conodon\" appeared, and that the presence of \"Mosasaurus\" in the Western Interior Seaway had a most profound impact in the restructuring of marine ecosystems. The biogeography of the region is generally subdivided into two Interior Subprovinces characterized by different climates and faunal structures, which border around modern-day Kansas. The oceanic climate of the Northern Interior Subprovince was likely a cool temperate one, while the Southern Interior Subprovince had warm temperate to subtropical climates. The faunal structure of both provinces prior to the appearance of \"Mosasaurus\" were generally much more diverse, and scientists have classified these periods of diversity as the Niobraran Age. During this age, the Northern Interior Subprovince was dominated by plesiosaurs, hesperornithid seabirds, and the mosasaur genus \"Platecarpus\"; and the Southern Interior Subprovince, which was much more diverse than the north in all groups, was dominated by sharks, turtles, and a large diversity of mosasaurs including \"Tylosaurus\" and \"Clidastes\".\n\nThe appearance of \"M. missouriensis\" and \"M. conodon\" in the Western Interior Seaway around 79.5 Ma marked the transition to the succeeding Navesinkan Age, which coincided with the collapse of the Niobraran order and a complete turnover of marine faunal structuring. In what is now modern-day Alabama within the Southern Interior Subprovince, most of the key genera including mosasaurs \"Clidastes\", \"Tylosaurus\", \"Globidens\", \"Halisaurus\", and \"Platecarpus\" and sharks such as \"Cretoxyrhina\" largely disappeared and were replaced by \"Mosasaurus\". The diversity of marine reptiles as a whole significantly declined and by then \"Mosasaurus\" dominated the entirety of the region, comprising around two-thirds of all mosasaur diversity with \"Plioplatecarpus\" and \"Prognathodon\" sharing the remaining third. The Northern Interior Subprovince also saw a restructuring of mosasaur assemblages by the beginning of the Navesinkan Age, characterized by the disappearance of mosasaurs like \"Platecarpus\" and their replacement by \"Mosasaurus\" and \"Plioplatecarpus\". However, Niobraran genera such as \"Tylosaurus\", \"Cretoxyrhina\", hesperornithids, and plesiosaurs including elasmosaurs such as \"Terminonatator\" and polycotylids like \"Dolichorhynchops\" maintained their presence until around the end of the Campanian, during which the Western Interior Seaway as a whole began to recede from the north. \"Mosasaurus\" continued to be the dominant genus in the seaway until the end of the Navesinkan Age during the closure of the Cretaceous. Although the appearance of \"Mosasaurus\" in the Western Interior Seaway marked a complete restructuring of marine communities centered around it, there were still many faunae that coexisted with \"Mosasaurus\". These additional genera included sea turtles such as \"Protostega\" and \"Archelon\"; many species of sea birds including \"Baptornis\", \"Ichthyornis\", and \"Halimornis\"; crocodilians such as \"Deinosuchus\"; and many genera of fish including sharks such as \"Cretalamna\", \"Squalicorax\", the goblin shark \"Scapanorhynchus\", \"Pseudocorax\", the sand tiger \"Odontaspis\", \"Serratolamna\", and the saw shark \"Ischyrhiza\"; and bony fish such as \"Enchodus\", \"Protosphyraena\", \"Stratodus\", and the ichthyodectids \"Xiphactinus\" and \"Saurodon\".\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" is known from Late Maastrichtian deposits in the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically the López de Bertodano Formation in Seymour Island. This locality is estimated to have located at around ~65°S latitude during the Maastrichtian. Being just within the Antarctic polar circle, the Seymour Island locality likely provided a rather unique climate. Chemical studies on oxygen-18 isotopes found in shells and benthic foraminifera have calculated intermediate-depth and deep-sea ocean temperatures at a mean average of with fluctuations of up to throughout the Maastrichtian; one of the same studies has also suggested that sea surface temperatures may have been colder, possibly dropping below freezing and forming sea ice at times. Alternatively, a study using the MBT/CBT technique deriving data from cyclization and methylation processes in ancient bacterial membrane lipids yielded a slightly warmer temperature of ±5 around 66 Ma. Nevertheless, these estimated climates characterize subpolar to cool temperate environments.\n\nAt least two species of \"Mosasaurus\" have been described in Seymour Island, but remains are often very fragmentary and described in open nomenclature. These species include one comparable with \"M. lemonnieri\" and another that appears to be closely related to \"M. hoffmannii\". A number of \"Mosasaurus\" fossils known in the locality are considered too fragmentary to be identified to the species level. Nevertheless, the genus appears to be the most taxonomically diverse in the Maastrichtian Antarctica. \"Mosasaurus\" is not the only mosasaur from Seymour Island; at least four other genera have been found in similar or same deposits. These include \"Plioplatecarpus\", the mosasaurines \"Moanasaurus\" and \"Liodon\", and the tylosaurine \"Kaikaifilu\". There is also an expectation for the presence of \"Prognathodon\" and \"Globidens\" based on distribution trends of both genera, although conclusive fossils have yet to be found. Other marine reptiles included elasmosaurid plesiosaurs such as \"Aristonectes\" and another indeterminable elasmosaurid unrelated to the former. The fish assemblage of the López de Bertodano Formation was dominated by \"Enchodus\" and ichthyodectiformes, accounting for 21.95% and 45.6% of local fish diversity respectively. Of the remaining percentages, sand sharks made up 10.5%, the cow shark \"Notidanodon\" 6.8%, chimaeras 3.9%, saw sharks 2.7%, various other teleost fish 2.4%, and the remaining 6% were shared between other sharks such as \"Paraorthacodus\", frilled sharks, \"Protosqualus\", and \"Cretalamna\".\n\nA traditional method of determining the habitat preference of fossil animals is though determining the habitat represented by the deposits they were from. Known fossils of \"Mosasaurus\" have typically been recovered from deposits that represented nearshore habitats during the Cretaceous, with some fossils coming from deeper water deposits. An early study on the habitat preference by Lingham-Soliar in 1995 elaborated on this, finding that Maastrichtian deposits in the Netherlands with \"M. hoffmannii\" occurrences, especially the Maastricht type locality, represented nearshore waters that were around in depth. Changing temperatures and an abundance in marine life were characteristic of these localities. The morphological build of \"M. hoffmannii\", nevertheless, was best adapted for a pelagic surface lifestyle. It had likely resided near the surface and exploited the rich marine assemblages provided by the locality.\n\nA more recently developing approach is through a biogeochemical one, an early method being though the measurement of δC levels in the enamel of \"Mosasaurus\" teeth. Another known correlation with δC levels shows that it typically depletes as the foraging habitat of the animal is farther from the shore, meaning that lower levels of the isotope can be correlated with feeding habitation in more open waters and vice-versa. This was tested on multiple \"Mosasaurus\" fossils by multiple studies which have yielded consistent results signifying that \"Mosasaurus\" fed in more offshore or open waters. However, it has been pointed out that measuring δC levels may not be the most accurate method of determining the preferred habitat of \"Mosasaurus\". This is because such isotope levels can also be partially determined by other factors in the animal's lifestyle. In \"M. hoffmannii\", one such factor would be its diet while the Bohr effect through diving behavior would have been another possible factor in \"M. lemonnieri\" and \"M. conodon\". As a result, isotope levels can misrepresent the actual habitat preferences of \"Mosasaurus\" due to such alterations by other factors.\n\nTo help remedy this issue, paleontologists T. Lynn Harrell Jr. and Alberto Perez-Huerta conducted a 2014 study that specifically examined the concentration ratios of neodymium, gadolinium, and ytterbium rare earth element signatures in \"M. hoffmannii\" fossils from Maastrichtian deposits in Alabama, a \"Mosasaurus\" specimen from the Campanian-age Demopolis Chalk, and a \"Mosasaurus\" fossil from the Hornerstown Formation in New Jersey. Previous studies have demonstrated that ratios in these three elements can proxy for relative ocean depth of a fossil during early diagenesis without interference from biological processes, with each of the three elements signifying either shallow, deep, fresh, or highly saline waters. The rare earth element ratios were found to be very consistent throughout most of the examined \"Mosasaurus\" fossils (indicating consistent habitat preference), which were clustered towards a ratio representing offshore habitats with ocean depths between or deeper than . A few outliers existed that instead represented shallower waters deep or less.\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" was contemporaneous with other large predatory mosasaurs that share a title as apex predators with it, most prominent among them being the tylosaurines and \"Prognathodon\". \"Tylosaurus bernardi\", the only surviving species of the genus during the Maastrichtian, measured up to in length while the largest coexisting species of \"Prognathodon\" such as \"P. saturator\" grew to an excess of . Moreover, the diets of these three types of mosasaurs converge as they all prey on similar animals such as on other marine reptiles.\n\nA study published in 2013 led by Schulp specifically tested how mosasaurs such as \"M. hoffmannii\" and \"P. saturator\" were able to coexist in the same localities through δC analysis. The scientists utilized an interpretation that differences in isotope values can help explain the level of resource partitioning due to the contributions of multiple environmental factors such as lifestyle, diet, and habitat preference in determining such. Comparisons between the δC levels in multiple teeth of \"M. hoffmannii\" and \"P. saturator\" from Maastricht Formation showed that while there was some convergence in isotopic levels between certain specimens, the average δC values between the two species were generally different. This is one indication of niche partitioning, in which the two mosasaurs likely foraged in different habitats or had different specific diets in order to coexist without direct competitive conflict as evidenced by the different biological factors driving their differing δC values. The morphological builds of the two species help add to the context of this finding. The teeth of \"P. saturator\" are much more robust than those in \"M. hoffmannii\" and are specifically equipped for preying on robust prey like turtles. While \"M. hoffmannii\" also preyed on turtles, its teeth were built to handle a wider range of prey that may be less suited for \"P. saturator\". Another case of presumed niche partitioning between \"Mosasaurus\" and \"Prognathodon\" from the Bearpaw Formation in Alberta has been examined in a 2014 study led by Takuya Konishi of the University of Cincinnati. In this case, the study found a dietary divide between \"M. missouriensis\" and \"Prognathodon overtoni\" based on stomach contents. Stomach contents of \"P. overtoni\" have included turtles and ammonites, which makes it another example of a diet specialized in harder prey. \"M. missouriensis\", on the other hand, has been found with stomach contents consisting of fish indicative of a diet specialized in softer prey. It was hypothesized that these adaptations were developed specifically to ensure the partitioning of resources between the two types of mosasaurs.\n\nHowever, this evidently did not entirely prevent competitive engagement. As with intraspecific combat amongst \"Mosasaurus\" individuals, there is also evidence of aggressive interspecific combat between \"Mosasaurus\" and other large mosasaur species. One such evidence is from a fossil skull of a subadult \"M. hoffmannii\" with skull fractures caused by a massive concentrated blow to the braincase dealt from a ramming-attack by a \"Tylosaurus bernardi\". This sort of attack has been compared to the defensive behavior of bottlenose dolphins when using their beaks to kill or repel lemon sharks, and it has been speculated that \"T. bernardi\" possibly dealt the offensive attack via an ambush on an unsuspecting \"Mosasaurus\". With the enormous known diets of \"Tylosaurus\", it has been loosely implied that this may have been motivated for food or territorial defense.\n\nBy the end of the Cretaceous, mosasaurs like \"Mosasaurus\" were at a height of radiation, and their extinction was a sudden and unexpected event. Indeed, the youngest fossils of \"Mosasaurus\" occur up to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and thus its demise was a result of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event that also wiped out the dinosaurs. Localities where \"Mosasaurus\" fossils have been found at least below the boundary or less include but not limited to the Maastricht Formation, the Davutlar Formation in Turkey, the Jagüel Formation in Argentina, Stevns Klint in Denmark, Seymour Island, and Missouri. Prior to the boundary event, global sea levels dropped, which drained the continents of their nutrient-rich seaways and altering circulation and nutrient patterns and thus reducing the amount of available habitat for \"Mosasaurus\". This would have surely affected its population, but \"Mosasaurus\" endured by accessing new habitats in more open waters.\n\n\"Mosasaurus\" fossils have been found within the K-Pg boundary itself between the Paleocene Clayton Formation and Cretaceous Owl Creek Formation in southeastern Missouri. Vertebra fossils from the layer have been found with post-mortem fractures and the deposition of the layer itself was likely the result of a tsunamtite, alternatively nicknamed \"Cretaceous cocktail deposit\". This means it was formed as a result of a combination of catastrophic seismic and geological disturbances, mega-hurricanes, and giant tsunamis as direct consequences of the impact of the Chicxulub asteroid. Aside from the physical kinetic destruction of these events, the impact also had subsequent environmental reverberations that led to a collapse of marine food webs. Any \"Mosasaurus\" that may have survived the immediate cataclysms by taking refuge in deeper waters would have eventually died out due to starvation from a total loss of prey structure.\n\nOne enigmatic occurrence is of \"Mosasaurus\" fossils found in the Hornerstown Formation, a deposit that is typically dated to be of the Paleocene Danian age. The discoveries have been found with an association of fossils of \"Squalicorax\", \"Enchodus\", and various ammonites within a uniquely fossil-rich bed at the base of the Hornerstown Formation known as the Main Fossiliferous Layer. However, this does not mean that \"Mosasaurus\" and its associated fauna may have survived the K-Pg extinction. Rather, there are several possible explanations as to why these animals have been found in nominally Cenozoic deposits. One argument proposes the fossils actually originated from an earlier Cretaceous deposit that was reworked into the Paleocene formation during its early deposition. Evidence of reworking typically comes from fossils that are worn down due to further erosion during its exposure at the time of its redeposition. Many of the \"Mosasaurus\" fossils from the Main Fossiliferous Layer consist of isolated bones that are commonly abraded and worn, however, the layer has also yielded more fresh \"Mosasaurus\" remains. Another explanation suggests that the Main Fossiliferous Layer is a Maastrichtian time-averaged remanie deposit, meaning that it originated from a Cretaceous deposit with little sedimentation and has been subject to gradual winnowing into the overlying deposits. A third hypothesis proposes a representation of a lag deposit of Cretaceous sediments that were forced out by a strong impact event such as a tsunami and was subsequently refilled with Cenozoic fossils.\n\n"}

{"id": "2051161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051161", "title": "Tichu", "text": "Tichu\n\nTichu (also known as Haris) is a multi-genre card game; primarily a shedding game that includes elements of Bridge, Daihinmin, and Poker played between two teams of two players each. Teams work to accumulate points; the first team to reach a predetermined score (usually 1,000 points) is the winner. Tichu is the trade name for what appears to be a variant of \"Dou di zhu\", \"Choi Dai Di\" (Cantonese) or \"Da Lao Er\" (Mandarin), meaning \"big two\", combined with \"Zheng Fen\" (\"Competing for Points\"). It is also marketed as \"Tai-Pan\" in Dutch. It was invented by Urs Hostettler and released in 1991.\n\nThe following covers the basic rules of gameplay. However, for more comprehensive rulesets, consult the links below.\n\nEach player sits across from their teammate so that play alternates between the two teams. The game is traditionally run \"counter\"-clockwise, but is frequently played clockwise.\n\nThe game is played with a deck of 56 cards, consisting of a 52-card deck of four suits (Jade, Sword, Pagoda, Star) plus four special cards (Mah Jong, Dog, Phoenix, Dragon). A standard 52-card deck with 4 jokers (marked to indicate the special cards) can also be used.\n\nEach player is dealt (or alternately \"draws\", in Chinese play) eight cards, and may call \"Grand Tichu,\" a 200-point bet that he (not his partner) will be the first to get rid of his cards. Once players have decided whether to make this call, six more cards are dealt (the remaining cards in the deck) and players may no longer declare \"Grand Tichu.\" Now, and at any time \"prior to playing his/her first card\", a player may call \"Tichu,\" a 100-point bet that he (not his partner) will be the first to get rid of his cards. The differences between Grand Tichu and Tichu are when they may be called, the number of cards you've seen, and the number of points involved.\n\nAll players prepare three cards for simultaneous exchange, with each player passing one card (face down) to each of the other players—one to each opponent and one to the partner. Should a player declare \"Tichu\" before the simultaneous exchange, players are allowed to change their out-going exchange cards.\n\nAfter the card exchange, the player with the Mah Jong leads the first trick. In Tichu, playable card combinations are generally based on Poker hands, with some exceptions. A player may pass on a trick with the option to play in later (essentially \"checking\" in Poker), and a trick is completed if it is passed three times in a row.\n\nPlayable card combinations include: a single card; any pair; two or more \"stairs\" (consecutive pairs; for example, 55667788. \"Non\"-consecutive pairs may not be played); three of a kind; straights of \"at least\" five cards in length, regardless of suit/color (so 56789TJQ is playable); and full houses (three of a kind & a pair). Four of a kind or a straight flush of at least five cards is a bomb which beats any card combination with the exception of a bigger bomb. Bombs may be played at any time (even out of turn) to end a trick, with every player given a chance to play bigger bombs before the trick is taken.\n\nAn example of \"bombing\": 10< K< D< 8888< AAAA< ♦9♦10♦J♦Q♦K< ♠2♠3♠4♠5♠6♠7.\n\nThe special cards affect gameplay accordingly:\n\n\nTeams gain or deduct points for Grand Tichu (±200 points) and/or Tichu (±100 points) calls. As an example: player A declared Grand Tichu and lost to D's Tichu. A&C lose 200 points and B&D gain 100 points.\n\nIf both players on a team get rid of all their cards before either player on the opposing team is out of cards, the winning team scores 200 points and there is no card scoring this round.\n\nThe last player out gives their remaining cards to the opposing team, and gives all the tricks they have won this round to the first player out.\n\nPoints are scored based on the cards in the tricks won by each team. Kings and tens are worth ten points each, fives are worth five points, the Dragon is worth 25 points, and the Phoenix is worth \"negative\" 25. All other cards score zero.\n\nIn 2015 Great Grand was introduced to the game. The Great Grand has its origins in Western-Norway, and it is widely spread in this area. The Great Grand is very similar to Grand Tichu, but instead of gaining or deducting 200 points, the team will gain or deduct 400 points. However, the Great Grand must be called before any of the cards are dealt. Variations on the Great Grand Tichu include the Blind Grand Tichu, which was developed independently by players in Minnesota and Iowa (USA) in 2013. A Blind Grand Tichu must be declared before an individual player looks at any of his/her cards. Other players may look at their cards prior to a player declaring a Blind Grand Tichu. The Blind Grand Tichu awards 400 points for success and deducts 400 points for failure. However, the players who developed the Blind Grand Tichu determined that the large number of points associated with it (400 of the 1000 required to win the game) too heavily encouraged declaring Blind Grand Tichu, skewing the game away from the traditional declarations of Tichu or Grand Tichu, and have therefore abandoned its use. \n\nRounds continue until a team scores 1,000 points or more.\n\nThe cards are dealt the same way as normal. The dealer forms a team with a dummy and the other two players are a \"normal\" team and do nothing different. The dealer controls his own cards and of the dummy. He may not declare a Grand Tichu, only a small one. The exchange in cards is normal, only the dealer and dummy do not give each other a card. After this, the cards of the dummy must lay face-up on the table. After the round, another player plays with dummy, because playing with dummy has a slight advantage. Scoring is done individually. Usually, a number of rounds is played that is a multiple of three, so each player plays with the dummy an equal number of times. The dummy can declare tichu as well and also isn't obliged to fulfil the wish of Mah Jong.\n\nIn Tientsin (Tianjin) tichu is played six-handed, two teams of three seated alternating round the table. The rules of the game are the same as for the four-handed version, except that:\n\n\nThere is no special reward for a double victory, but a triple victory (one team gets rid of all its cards while all three opponents still hold cards) scores 300 points.\n\nThe seating order is the Alpha and Omega of Grand Seigneur, which is very similar to President or Daifugō. At the head of the table, in the most comfortable armchair in the house, sits the Great Lord himself. On his left is the number two in the hierarchy, the Lord. Further to the left, in third place, sits the Squire. In fourth place the Burgher. Number five is the Pauper. In last place - so at the right of the Great Lord - sits the Wretch on a simple kitchen stool.\n\nThe number of places corresponds to the number taking part. If need be, obscure forms such as Grand Burgher or Petty Pauper can be added in. Obviously women use the corresponding forms, such as Wretch (f).\n\nThe first round is a simple round of Tichu, without any pushing of cards or any point values, in which everyone tries to get rid of his cards as quickly as possible - to be elected as the first Great Lord of the day. Whoever gets rid of his cards second becomes the first Lord and so on. The players then move into the seats to which they are entitled.\n\nThe social injustice of the game of Grand Seigneur appears in the pushing in the second round.\nIf five play one card less is handed over at each level.\nThe recipients simultaneously push the corresponding number of cards back - but useless cards of their choice.\n\nThe Mah Jong begins, the uneven contest takes it course and the winner becomes Great Lord, the tailender becomes the Wretch. The players take their new-won places - provided that any positions have changed. Great Lords are hard to overthrow due to the uneven card exchange.\n\nThere is no defined end to the game, only the glory of being Grand Lord. It is all for fun.\nThe use of two packs is recommended when 7 or more play Grand Seigneur. The Hound and Mah Jong must be removed from the second pack. Extra rules:\n\n"}
{"id": "2051166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051166", "title": "Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)", "text": "Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling, a cruiserweight is a wrestler who competes in a Cruiserweight division. The term was first coined in United States in 1996 by World Championship Wrestling. Prior to this, the terms \"Light Heavyweight\" and \"Junior Heavyweight\" were more commonly in use. A cruiserweight division is traditionally open to wrestlers weighing 220 lb (100 kg) or less. The older term junior heavyweight is still favored in Japan, where many titles for lighter-weight competitors are called junior heavyweight titles. Prominent titles include New Japan Pro Wrestling's IWGP, Pro Wrestling Noah's GHC, and All Japan Pro Wrestling's World championships.\n\nThe weight limit used by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Japanese promotions is \"up to 220 lbs\" (100 kg), while WWE currently uses 205 lb (93 kg) as its weight limit. Due to the scripted nature of professional wrestling and that the billed weight of wrestlers can be changed, weight classes usually are not strictly enforced as they are in professional boxing and mixed martial arts. New Japan and Noah also have junior heavyweight tag team titles, for teams composed of junior heavyweights. WCW tested such a format with their own title shortly before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation. In 2016, WWE relaunched its Cruiserweight championship using a 205 lb weight limit, and also introduced a dedicated weekly program, \"205 Live\", focusing exclusively on cruiserweights.\n\nCruiserweight divisions and championships have risen to much greater prominence in wrestling promotions in Japan and Mexico than the United States. While there have been various wrestling companies over the years that have promoted cruiserweight/junior heavyweight titles and divisions in the U.S., they have had comparatively little prominence when compared to World Heavyweight champions. \n\nCruiserweight wrestlers are generally shorter and possess less muscle bulk than heavyweights, a build which lends itself to a high-flying wrestling style. While there are many cruiserweights who specialize in alternate wrestling styles, cruiserweights are strongly associated with moves performed from the top rope and moves requiring a degree of speed, agility, balance and torque. Cruiserweight wrestling is often associated with lucha libre, where similar moves and match pacing are used, but Mexico uses a different weight class system and the actual term \"cruiserweight\" (\"crucero\", in Spanish) is rarely used in favor of Light-Heavyweight (\"peso semicompleto\" in Spanish). Cruiserweight wrestlers tend to be wrestlers of average human height and weight.\n\nThe high spots often performed by cruiserweights are visually impressive but carry a varying degree of risk. Cruiserweight matches are not limited to such moves and due to the greater speed and agility of the wrestlers can involve more technical grappling than that seen in heavyweight divisions. A match with little to no transition between the spots is known as a spotfest. While spotfests do occur featuring heavyweights, the term is typically more used for cruiserweights, arguably because many of the fast-paced exchanges do not lend themselves as well to ring psychology as the more deliberately paced power moves and holds common in a heavyweight match. Some fans and wrestlers alike use the term \"spotmonkey\" to describe wrestlers whose matches consist primarily of high spots. In the United States, the term is generally meant as an insult and derogatory criticism, suggesting that the wrestlers have to rely on risky spots to get a reaction from fans due to a lack of charisma, personality and understanding of psychology.\n\nChampionships contested by cruiserweights cannot be held by wrestlers who are not cruiserweights, but cruiserweights are normally eligible to compete for heavyweight championships (e.g. Rey Mysterio winning the World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestlemania 22 despite being just under 200 lbs).\n\nThe term was popularized in World Championship Wrestling, when WCW President Eric Bischoff in 1996 re-established the light-heavyweight division as the cruiserweight division and reactivated the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship as the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Bischoff renamed the division because he felt that \"light-heavyweight\" was a pejorative term. During Bischoff's stay in the company, the smaller wrestlers gradually became less important. As a result, in the declining years of WCW, the cruiserweights were seen more as comic relief to the heavyweight wrestlers. As one of the top wrestlers in the division, Rey Mysterio would go on to voice his disdain in regards to Eric's business sentiment:\n\nAfter the World Wrestling Federation acquired the intellectual property of WCW in 2001, the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship was abandoned in favor of the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, and the title was renamed the WWF Cruiserweight Championship (and then WWE); however, the title was eventually retired, with Hornswoggle serving as the last champion before being stripped of the title for his own safety. Prior to acquiring WCW, the WWF sanctioned two cruiserweight titles of its own. In 1965, while operating under the name of the World Wide Wrestling Federation, the WWWF Junior Heavyweight Championship was created. Initially, the title was used from September 1965 until sometime in 1972. During this period, the title was held four times by Johnny De Fazio and was vacated after his retirement in 1972. The championship was reactivated in January 1978 with the first new champion being Carlos Jose Estrada. By this time, the company had renamed itself the World Wrestling Federation and engaged in a cross promotional agreement with New Japan Pro Wrestling. Three days after Estrada won the vacant title, he was defeated by Tatsumi Fujinami. Going forward, the title was almost exclusively used by New Japan while the WWF retained ownership. The title was vacated and retired for the final time on October 31, 1985 as a result of New Japan and the WWF ending their working relationship.\n\nAnother cruiserweight championship sanctioned by the WWF existed simultaneously alongside the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship. In early 1981, the company created the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, though unlike the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship, the Light Heavyweight Championship was used primarily in Mexico due to a working agreement with the Mexican promotion Universal Wrestling Association. New Japan Pro Wrestling also recognized the championship and the title was used as part of several cross promotional cards between New Japan and the UWA. The WWF's working agreement with the UWA came to an end in 1995 and the title was returned to the WWF by 1997. The WWF did not sanction the reign of any of the previous champions, adopting a revisionist history tactic with the company claiming that the title was created in 1997. The title remained activated from December 7, 1997 until it was retired in late 2001 when the WWF replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship with the WWF Cruiserweight Championship, later rebranded with the company's new \"WWE\" moniker.\n\nNeither the Light Heavyweight or Cruiserweight Championship were particularly prominent in the company; however, over the years the notion of lighter wrestlers becoming main event stars has become more accepted in WWE due to many of the top talents over the past 15 years arguably falling into the cruiserweight category. As a result, a very substantial portion of WWE's roster are billed at, slightly less, or slightly more than 220 lbs. Many lighter wrestlers have achieved main event status within WWE and, over the years, have won several world heavyweight championships. For instance, the billed weight of former WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan is 210 lbs. Other lighter wrestlers who have risen to prominence as main eventers and world heavyweight champions include Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Dolph Ziggler, Christian, Rey Mysterio, Jeff Hardy, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, CM Punk, Seth Rollins, Finn Balor, A.J. Styles, and Kofi Kingston.\n\nIn 2016, WWE began to re-launch its cruiserweight division by producing the Cruiserweight Classic—a 32-man tournament with participants billed as being under , the lower limit of cruiserweight in MMA. The Cruiserweight Classic was won by T.J. Perkins, who became inaugural holder of the new WWE Cruiserweight Championship. The new championship was initially part of the Raw brand, and does not share the same title history as the previous Cruiserweight Championship that was retired in 2007. In November 2016, WWE Network introduced a new weekly program known as \"205 Live\", exclusively featuring cruiserweight performers. The championship was defended on both \"Raw\" and \"205 Live\" until 2018, when it became exclusive to the newly-created 205 Live brand. In late-2019, WWE began to merge 205 Live into the NXT brand and creative, including renaming the championship the NXT Cruiserweight Championship, and allowing NXT cruiserweights to appear on \"205 Live\" and vice versa.\n\nIn 2002, TNA established the \"X Division\"—a blanket branding for matches held with no upper or lower weight limits, and an associated X Division Championship. Rather than emphasize weight, X Division placed a focus on crossover between traditional wrestling styles with faster-paced, high-flying moves associated with cruiserweights. Despite this, almost all of the X Division champions have been high-flyers, with Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Abyss and Lashley being notable exceptions. In August 2011, the division was given a weight limit until they went back being an openweight division. In 2013, the weight limit returned, only for it to be repealed again when the new rules were rejected by fans.\n\nDue to their initial affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance, many NWA territories have started sanctioning their own X Division championships, while some of them even replaced the territories' cruiserweight belts.\n\nThe following is a list of all titles equivalent to a cruiser weight championship. Title names vary, but include cruiserweight, lightweight, midweight, middleweight, flyweight, welterweight, featherweight, X Division, and junior heavyweight in their name. It is worth noting that each of these class listings are separate in boxing and amateur wrestling, but are almost interchangeable in professional wrestling.\n\n\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Contested under 225 lb weight limit from March to October 2012; no official weight limit before or since that period, though in practice most champions tend to be cruiserweights.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Contested under 205 lb weight limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Carroll does not describe her physically in much detail, although as stated in Chapter 9, \"Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was \"very\" ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.\" Her hideous appearance and short stature is strongly established in the popular imagination thanks to John Tenniel's illustrations and from context it is clear that Alice finds her quite unattractive.\n\nThe Duchess is an antagonist of The Queen of Hearts. In her first appearance, the Duchess seems nearly as unpleasant as the Queen herself, but later on treats Alice with friendliness and respect.\n\nAccording to Martin Gardner in \"The Annotated Alice\", John Tenniel's drawings of the Duchess were inspired by Quentin Matsys's \"The Ugly Duchess\" (c. 1513) in the National Gallery. It has been said that the painting is a portrait of Margaret, Countess of Tyrol, who had the reputation of being the ugliest woman who ever existed. The painting, however, was done 200 years after her death.\n\nThe Duchess lives in Wonderland in a small palace just outside the Caterpillar's forest. She employs a footman, whom Alice thinks resembles a frog, and a Cook, who is addicted to pepper and who throws crockery and kitchen utensils over her shoulder with no concern for those who might be hit. The footman enjoys staring at the sky for days on end, oblivious to most people in or out of the house. The Duchess also has a child and a cat (the Cheshire Cat).\nLewis Carroll is not explicit about her physical attributes, but Tenniel's drawings illustrate an ugly and grotesque woman with an extremely large head. Her character is strongly voluble; at times she even seems to have a double personality. When she first meets Alice in her kitchen, she shows herself to be nervous, aggressive.\n\nShe recites one of the better-known rhymes in the book, when she advocates beating a child for sneezing:\n\n\"Speak roughly to your little boyand beat him when he sneezeshe only does it to annoybecause he knows it teases.I speak severely to my boyI beat him when he sneezesfor he can thoroughly enjoythe pepper when he pleases\"\n\nAs the Cook has absolutely saturated the kitchen with pepper and the baby sneezes constantly, one can only conclude he has probably suffered quite a bit at his mother's hands. Taking pity on the child, Alice spirits him away, only to find that he has transformed into a pig. It is never explained why this happens, but Alice looks on the bright side, concluding that while the baby wasn't a very attractive baby, it makes for a good-looking pig.\n\nOf the Duchess' household, the Cat appears to be by far the most balanced and sensible, although it states that—like everyone else in Wonderland—it is mad. How the Cat came to live with the Duchess is, like so many other matters in Wonderland, a mystery. Later, when the Cat meets up with Alice, it appears it has left the Duchess for good.\n\nWhen Alice meets the Duchess for the second time at the Queen's croquet party, the Duchess is much more chatty and almost flirtatious, seemingly determined to charm the young girl for reasons unknown. She repeatedly places her chin firmly on Alice's shoulder, which Alice finds disturbing as well as uncomfortable, as the Duchess has a very sharp, pointy chin. (In Kurt Vonnegut's novel \"Breakfast of Champions\" he also has a character do this, and Vonnegut breaks the fourth wall to tell readers that it is a direct homage to this famous scene with the Duchess.) Even so, Alice begins to suspect that the Duchess might actually have a pleasant personality after all, and that her earlier ruthlessness was caused by the pepper. In any case, the Duchess has no concern for her baby now that he's become a pig.\n\nThe Duchess is often seen as a child's-eye-view of emotionally volatile and mysterious adults, switching back and forth between dark moods and condescending affection at unpredictable times.\n\nThe Duchess' Cook lives in the Duchess' Palace, obsessed with pepper and thus throws it all over the place, causing the Baby and Duchess to sneeze constantly. She also smashes plates everywhere with crockery and kitchen utensils.\n\nIn the 2010 Tim Burton film, Thackery Earwicket (March Hare) shares many of The Cook's characteristics such as enjoying smashing plates and throwing pepper.\n\n"}
{"id": "2051173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051173", "title": "West Side Line", "text": "West Side Line\n\nThe West Side Line, also called the West Side Freight Line, is a railroad line on the west side of the New York City borough of Manhattan. North of Penn Station, from 34th Street, the line is used by Amtrak passenger service heading north via Albany to Toronto; Montreal; Niagara Falls and Buffalo, New York; Rutland, Vermont; and Chicago. South of Penn Station, a elevated section of the line abandoned since 1980 has been transformed into an elevated park called the High Line. The south section of the park from Gansevoort Street to 20th Street opened in 2009 and the second section up to 30th Street opened in 2011, while the final section to 34th Street opened in 2014.\n\nThe West Side Line was built by the Hudson River Railroad, which completed the to Peekskill on September 29, 1849, opened to Poughkeepsie by the end of that year, and extended to Albany in 1851. The city terminus was at the junction of Chambers and Hudson Streets; the track was laid along Hudson, Canal, and West Streets, to Tenth Avenue, which it followed to the upper city station at 34th Street. Over this part of the right-of-way, the rails were laid at grade along the streets, and since by the corporation regulations locomotives were not allowed, the cars were drawn by a dummy engine, which, according to an 1851 description, consumed its own smoke. While passing through the city the train of cars was preceded by a man on horseback known as a \"West Side cowboy\" or \"Tenth Avenue cowboy\" who gave notice of its approach by blowing a horn.\n\nAt 34th Street the right-of-way curved into Eleventh Avenue, the dummy engine was detached, and the regular locomotive took the train. As far as 60th Street, the track was at street level. The first cut was at Fort Washington Point. The railroad crossed Spuyten Duyvil Creek on a drawbridge; a fatal wreck occurred there January 13, 1882 when the Atlantic Express, stopped on the line, was rear-ended by a local train, telescoping the last two palace cars, where the stoves and lamps were upset and ignited the woodwork and upholstery.\n\nIn 1867 the New York Central Railroad and Hudson River Railroad were united by Cornelius Vanderbilt, being merged in 1869 to form the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. The railroad acquired the former Episcopal church's St. John's Park property and built a large freight depot at Beach and Varick streets which opened in 1868. The tracks south to Chambers Street were then removed. In 1871, the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad (Hudson Line) opened, and most passenger trains were rerouted into the new Grand Central Depot via that line along the northeast bank of the Harlem River and the New York and Harlem Railroad (Harlem Line), also part of the New York Central system. The old line south of Spuyten Duyvil remained for freight to the docks along Manhattan's west side and minimal passenger service to the West Side station on Chambers Street (used until 1916).\n\nAs the city grew, congestion worsened on the west side. Eventually plans were drawn up for a grade-separated line. The West Side Elevated Highway was built with the line's grade separation in the 1930s. Work on the highway – named for Manhattan Borough President Julius Miller, who championed it – began in 1925, and the first section was dedicated June 28, 1934. This included a new elevated eight-track freight terminal at St. John's Park, located several blocks north of the old one, with a south edge at Spring Street. North of there, an elevated structure (the present-day High Line) carried two tracks north on the west side of Washington Street, curving onto the east side of Tenth Avenue at 14th Street, then crossing Tenth Avenue at 17th Street and heading north along its west side. Just south of the Pennsylvania Station rail yard at 31st–33rd Streets, the line turned west on the north side of 30th Street, then north just east of the West Side Highway. The northernmost bridge crossed 34th Street, and a ramp took it back to Eleventh Avenue south of 35th Street. The elevated line was built through the second or third floors of several buildings along the route; others were served directly by elevated sidings.\n\nIn 1937 the tracks along Eleventh Avenue were bypassed by a below-grade line, passing under the 35th Street intersection and running north just west of Tenth Avenue before slowly curving northwest, passing under Eleventh Avenue at 59th Street and rejoining the original alignment.\nAround the same time, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses covered the line from 72nd Street north to 120th Street with an expansion of Riverside Park. His project, called the \"West Side Improvement\", was twice as expensive as the Hoover Dam and created the Henry Hudson Parkway, as well as a railroad tunnel through the park. The large 60th Street Yard served as the dividing point between the two-track realignment and a wider four-track line to the north. North of 123rd Street, the line became elevated between the Henry Hudson Parkway and Riverside Drive before returning to the surface and crossing under the Parkway to its west side near 159th Street. It continues along the shore of the Hudson River to the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, a swing bridge across the Harlem Ship Canal (Spuyten Duyvil Creek), before merging with the Hudson Line just north of the bridge.\n\nIn addition to serving the industrial and dock areas of the Lower West Side, the line was the primary route for produce and meat into New York, serving warehouses in the West Village, Chelsea, and the Meatpacking District, as well as serving the James Farley Post Office and private freight services.\n\nThe New York Central Railroad was merged into Penn Central in 1968 and Conrail in 1976. Conrail continued to operate freight along the West Side Line until the 1980s.\n\nDonald Trump optioned the 60th Street Yard in 1974. Riverside South, the development project he ultimately began there, was then the city's biggest private residential development; it faced opposition from many people living on the Upper West Side. To obtain approval of his project, Trump agreed to substantially reduce the size of his ambitions, build Riverside Park South on of the yard, and donate the park and the right-of-way for a relocated highway to the city.\n\nThe line north of 31st Street was acquired by Amtrak. The southernmost part of the High Line (south of Bank Street) had been removed in the 1960s; the structure from Bank to Gansevoort Streets was removed some 20 years later. The northernmost block of the High Line viaduct, between 34th and 35th Streets, was rerouted to the south of 34th Street in the 1980s because the ramp to 35th Street was demolished as part of the Javits Center's construction. However, the realigned ramp was never used. By mid-2005, the rest of the High Line was owned by CSX, which acquired it after the 1999 breakup of Conrail.\n\nThe Empire Connection allows Amtrak's passenger trains traveling on the Empire Corridor from Albany in upstate New York, and beyond, to enter Penn Station. Before its construction, Empire Service trains came into Grand Central Terminal, requiring passengers bound for Northeast Corridor trains to transfer to Penn Station via shuttle bus, taxicab, subway or on foot. This was a legacy of the fact that the Empire Service lines had previously been part of the New York Central Railroad, who built and owner Grand Central, while Penn Station was owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The two stations have never been connected, even after the PRR and New York Central merged as Penn Central in 1968 and after Amtrak took over intercity rail service in 1971.\n\nWhen the West Side Yard for the Long Island Rail Road was built on the west side of Manhattan in 1986, a tunnel was built under it connecting Penn Station to the West Side Line just west of Eleventh Avenue, near the Javits Center. The project severed the southernmost part of the West Side Line, the High Line viaduct, from the rest of the West Side Line. When additional funding later became available, one track along the northern part of the West Side Line was rebuilt for passenger service and named the Empire Connection. A short section of single track into Penn Station was electrified using third rail and overhead catenary, since diesel locomotives are not allowed in Penn Station's tunnels. North of 41st Street, the single track expands into two tracks and electrification on the line ends. A wye was constructed next to Track 2 (the westernmost track) to allow diesels to turn around. South of 49th Street, there is a crossover from Track 1 (the easternmost track) to Track 2, and another siding splits off Track 2 at 49th Street. The Empire Connection was double-tracked north of 39th Street to south of the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge in the mid-1990s.\n\nOn April 7, 1991, all of Amtrak's trains departing for or arriving from Albany and points north began using the Empire Connection into Penn Station, ending service to Grand Central. Transportation planners had long envisioned consolidating all intercity service to New York at Penn Station, but those efforts never got beyond the planning stages until the 1980s. Besides being more convenient for passengers, many of whom had balked at taking the train to New York City due to the difficulty of transferring between stations, this saved Amtrak the expense of operating two stations in New York City. Additionally, Amtrak had to pay $600,000 per year to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of Grand Central, to use that station's tracks.\n\nUnder the Penn Station Access project, Metro-North Railroad is studying ways it could also serve Penn Station. One alternative being studied would run some Hudson Line commuter trains into Penn Station via the Empire Connection, possibly with new station stops at West 125th and West 62nd Streets.\n\nIn the early 1980s, as the connections to Penn Station were created, the line south of 34th Street was disconnected from the rest of the U.S. railway system. This portion of the line, entirely on an elevated viaduct, stood dormant for over thirty years. This viaduct, now called the High Line, has been turned into an elevated park which opened in phases from June 2009 to fall 2014.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

His father's family had been landowners, originally at Bitton in Gloucestershire, since the 1100s. Around 1595 he married Elizabeth, daughter of landowner Sir Walter Rice of Newton House, Llandeilo, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Mansell of Margam. This made him a nephew of the prominent naval officer Sir Robert Mansell, from whose patronage he benefited for the rest of his career.\nIn April 1612 he was given command of two navy ships, \"Resolution\" and \"Discovery\", to lead an expedition in search of the North-West Passage. Sailing from England about the beginning of May 1612, they reached the mouth of a river which he named the Nelson after the ship's master, who had died. They wintered at what is now known as Port Nelson and the next year headed north to search for the Northwest Passage. They lost the \"Resolution\" to sea ice and continued on to 65° North. He discovered and named Mansel Island and returned to England in September 1613. He is credited with exploring and securing the west coast of Hudson Bay for his country, naming the area New Wales. The region would again be visited twelve years later in 1631 by Captains Thomas James and Luke Foxe. Supposedly, upon discovering a cross erected by Button at Port Nelson, Captain Foxe christened the shore north of the Nelson River as New North Wales and all the lands south as New South Wales. Button and his men were some of the first recorded Europeans to explore the area now known as Manitoba and his discovery meant that others followed after him, using his landmarks, his stories, and his detailed notes. The first maps of areas near Hudson Bay were struck from his explorations and from those of his predecessor, Henry Hudson.\n\nOn his return, he was appointed Admiral of the Irish Coasts in command of the Irish Squadron and on 30 August 1616 was knighted by the Lord Deputy of Ireland. Despite his standing in the Navy, his subsequent career was marked by prolonged quarrels with the Admiralty, wrongs being committed on both sides, resulting in the end with him in ill-health being stripped of his post as Admiral and left effectively bankrupt. He was buried on 8 April 1634 at the church of St Margaret's, Westminster, survived by his wife and five of their seven children. He left no will and his Welsh lands passed to his eldest son, Miles, who had to mortgage them to meet his father's debts. After waiting three years, his widow received 650 pounds (equivalent to about 98,000 pounds in 2015) from the government in settlement of pay and expenses he was owed.\n\n"}
{"id": "2051191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051191", "title": "Hale Barns", "text": "Hale Barns\n\nHale Barns is a village near Altrincham in the borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. Hale Barns lies about south-west of Manchester city centre, 2 miles west of Manchester Airport and close to the River Bollin. At the 2011 census, the village had a population of 9,736.\n\nIn the medieval period, Hale Barns was an outlying area of the township of Hale, but a growth in prosperity led to it becoming a separate settlement. The village gets its name from the tithe barn that used to stand there. Before the industrial revolution, Hale Barns was an agricultural village, but since then evolved into a commuter settlement. St Ambrose College Roman Catholic boys' grammar school is in Hale Barns and the village is also home to Ringway golf club. Cotteril Clough in Hale Barns is an ancient and diverse woodland and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nWhat were thought to be fragments of Roman pottery tiles were found in Hale Barns in the 1880s near the site of what is now St Ambrose College. The artefacts were lost before their antiquity could be confirmed, but led local historian W. Thompson Wakin to suggest there was probably a Roman villa in the area.\n\nThe first reference to Hale is contained within the Domesday Book, at the time 'Hale Barns' was just an outlying hamlet contained within the manor of Hale. According to the Domesday Book, the manor of Hale was owned by a Saxon thegn Aelfward, who was replaced by the Norman, Hamon de Massey who also gained possession of Dunham and Bowdon and would remain barons of the area until the 14th century. The manor was considered prosperous in comparison to other manors in the north west of England.\n\nThe settlements of Hale and Hale Barns are closely linked; what would later become Hale Barns spent most of the medieval period as an extension of the more dominant Hale. During this era the land around Hale and Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns – rather than Hale – is in a document from 1616.\n\nThe English Civil War affected all of England; even families were split over Royalist or Parliamentarian loyalties. Little is recorded over the divisions within Hale Barns, but Hale and Hale Barns did emerge from the Civil War more or less untouched by events – though there was a heavy tax to pay to support the Parliamentarian army they avoided much of the requisitioning of supplies and animals for passing armies. None of the Royalists in Hale and Hale Barns had their lands confiscated or was forced to pay fines.\nHaving long been agricultural land, in the 18th century the town was divided up into five farms: Tanyard, Partington, Oakfield, Broadoak, and Elm. Hale Chapel was established in Hale Barns by Nonconformists in 1723 on what is now Chapel Lane. It underwent alterations around 1880. The chapel is the earliest place of worship in either Hale or Hale Barns and is a Grade II* listed building, one of only nine in Trafford. It also houses an eighteenth-century pulpit and nineteenth-century stained glass. In 1740, a school was founded by the Unitarian minister of Hale – a time when education was a rare commodity – and can be seen on a map of 1800 along with a tithe barn, two inns, five farms, four cottages, the school house and school rooms.\n\nIn the late 19th century a building called \"Manor House\" was built on the site of the old Tanyard farm, for the purpose of the owner's retirement. In 2006 a timber-framed barn built around 1701 – originally belonging to the Tanyard Farm and later converted to stables for Manor House – was torn down due to lack of funds to maintain the building. The Grade II listed building – known as \"Manor House Stables\" – was the last timber-framed building in Hale Barns.\n\nDuring the 20th century, urbanisation affected Hale Barns, turning the place from an agricultural village into the commuter settlement it is today, focused around The Square – a shopping precinct. Its main A538 road – Hale Road – runs through the centre of Hale Barns and leads towards Manchester Airport and Wilmslow.\n\nThe name Hale, which occurs throughout Britain, derives from the Anglo-Saxon \"halh\" meaning a nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area which has natural features that would provide shelter. \"Barns\" comes from the Old Tithe Barn.\n\nHale Barns is part of Trafford Metropolitan Borough of Greater Manchester. Up until local government reforms in 1974, Hale Barns formed part of the administrative county of Cheshire. The Hale Barns ward has three out of sixty-three seats on Trafford Council, and at the 2012 local election all three seats were held by the Conservatives. Since 1997, Hale Barns has formed part of the Altrincham and Sale West Constituency, before that it was encompassed by the Altrincham and Sale constituency. Since the formation of the Altrincham and Sale West constituency in 1997 it had been represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP, Sir Graham Brady.\n\nHale Barns is located at (53.3676, −2.318), to the south of Manchester city centre. It is just east of Hale and south east of Altrincham. The town is bounded by the River Bollin to the south, the M56 to the east and the residential areas of Altrincham to the west and Newall Green to the north. The ward profile produced by Trafford MBC describes its location and economic nature as follows.\n\n\"Hale Barns lies at the southern tip of the Borough (of Trafford) ... The Ward contains a large amount of agricultural land including two private golf courses. There is also a number of private sports clubs within the Ward providing facilities for tennis, bowling and football. It is generally considered to be an affluent Ward in the top 10% wealthiest areas in England.\"\n\nThe climate of Hale Barns – and Greater Manchester as a whole – is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom; whereas annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine is slightly below the average for the UK.\n\nAt the 2001 UK census, the village of Hale Barns had a total population of 9,143 and 3732 households. Of those households, 44% were married couples living together, 5% were co-habiting couples and 6% were lone parents. The town had a high percentage of households made up of married couples (44%) compared to the figure for the rest of Trafford (37%) and England (also 37%). The average household size was 2.45. For every 100 females, there were 93.9 males.\n\nThe ethnicity of the Hale Barns is 91.9% white, 1.1% mixed race, 0.4% black, 5.4% non-Chinese Asian, and 1.2% Chinese. The age distribution was 6% aged 0–4 years, 15% aged 5–15 years, 4% aged 16–19 years, 27% aged 20–44 years, 27% aged 45–64 years and 22% aged 65 years and over. The town had a high percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%.\n\nThe Trafford MBC Ward Profile for the Hale Barns ward describes it as being\n\"Diverse in nature and home to a large Jewish and Muslim community groups.\"\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the religious make up of Hale Barns is 70.4% Christian, 7.9% Jewish, 4.1% Muslim, 1.5% Hindu, 0.3% Buddhist and 0.1% Sikh. 9.5% were recorded as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 6.2% did not state their religion. Hale Barns is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury. and the Church of England Diocese of Chester. Places of worship include Holy Angels' Church a large Roman Catholic Church linked to St Ambrose College which is situated in Wicker Lane at the junction with Hale Road at the western end of the village centre; All Saints' Church belongs to the Church of England and was built 1967 on the site.\n\nHale and District Synagogue serves Ashkenazi Jews across Hale and Hale Barns and is situated on Shay Lane in Hale Barns. It was rebuilt on its previous site in 2003; the modern structure has a synagogue, nursery, function suite and dedicated study room Beit HaMidrash. It is also the site of the South Manchester Mikveh with a utensil mikveh that is adjuncted to the main mikveh building.\n\nThere is also a newly built synagogue for the Sephardic community called Sha'are Rachamim. South Manchester has been home to Sephardic Jews and a Western Sephardic community since the early twentieth century. This new building is for a community established in Didsbury in 1904, before moving synagogue to Withington in 1927. At that time the area also saw the establishment of an Eastern Sephardic community, Shaare Zedek. The two communities merged under the name Shaare Hayim at the end of the century, and alternate between and combine the various Sephardic traditions and melodies, now housed together in the new purpose built facility.\n\nBecause of its small size, Hale Barns has few schools. Amongst them are St Ambrose College which provides education for 11- to 18-year-olds and Elmridge Primary.\n\n\nElmridge Primary School is a co-educational day school. It had 240 pupils in the 2011/12 school year.\n\n\nSt. Ambrose College is a Catholic Boy's Secondary School situated adjacent to Holy Angels Church and Hale Road, near the centre of Hale Barns village. The Christian Brothers came to England from Guernsey during the Second World War and remained to establish the college in 1946. The college celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2006. The school is a specialist Maths and Computing College.\n\nIn 2005 around 800 pupils attended the school. The College was awarded funding in the summer of 2006 for rebuilding on the current site as part of the Building Schools for the Future Programme. In 2006, 98.3% of pupils achieved at least 5 A*-C grades at GCSE compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%; 97.5% of its pupils gained at least 5 A*-C grades at GCSE including English and maths, ranking the school 4th out of Trafford's 19 secondary schools.\n\nIn December 2012, the college was implicated in a child sex abuse case involving teaching staff carrying out alleged acts of abuse both on and off school grounds, although no current staff are said to be involved.\nMore than fifty former pupils contacted police, either as victims of, or witnesses to, sexual abuse. The alleged sexual abuse, including molestation of children while corporal punishment was administered, stemmed from 1962 onwards and continued over four decades.\n\nAccording to Trafford MBC, Hale Barns is in the top 10% wealthiest areas in England. At the 2001 UK census, the Hale Barns ward had a possible workforce of approximately 6,449 people. The economic activity of residents in the Hale Barns electoral ward was 36% in full-time employment, 12% in part-time employment, 28% self-employed, 1.5% unemployed, 1.7% students with jobs, 4.7% students without jobs, 18.7% retired, 7.3% looking after home or family, 2.6% permanently sick or disabled and 2.2% economically inactive for other reasons. Hale Barns has a very high rate of self-employment (28%) compared with rest of Trafford (16%) and England (17%). Hale Barns also has low rates of unemployment (1.5%) compared with Trafford (2.7%) and England (3.3%). The Office for National Statistics estimated that during the period of April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in Hale Barns was £660 (£34,320 per year).\n\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents in Hale Barns was 22.9% property and business services, 15.7% retail and wholesale, 12.1% health and social work, 11.0% manufacturing, 9.4% education, 6.8% transport and communications, 4.7% finance, 4.5% construction, 3.9% hotels and restaurants, 3.2% public administration and defence, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.5% agriculture, and 4.6% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the town's relatively high percentage of workers in property and business services.\n\nA shopping centre was built in Hale Barns in the 1960s called \"The Square Shopping Centre\". The site was being considered for redevelopment and proposals were subjected to consultation in 2005. In 2007 the Council and Developer participated in a Planning Inquiry after the council refused planning permission for the proposed redevelopment. However, in 2013, the council agreed, and the new shopping Centre, containing a Booths and a Costa Coffee, is now open.\nThere are a number of private sports clubs within the Hale Barns providing facilities for tennis, bowling and football. This includes the home of Hale Barns Cricket Club.\n\n\nHalecroft Park is near the centre of Hale Barns and was crowned North West region winner in the prestigious 'Britain's Best Park' competition. Designed by Edgar Wood, the ornamental gardens of Halecroft Park were created in 1891 as part of Halecroft House. The park was winner of the Green Flag Award 3 years running (2003–2006) for setting a standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales.\n\n\nPrivate members tennis club with 5 astroturf courts, one floodlit, established in 1924 at The Pavilion, Chapel Lane.\n\n\nCovering 18 holes and 6,482 yards, Ringway Golf Club was designed by Harry Colt in 1909 and further developed by James Braid.\n\nRingway & Hale Barns WI\n\nFounded in 1957, Ringway & Hale Barns WI has around 25 members. Meetings are normally held on the fourth Thursday of the month at the All Saints Church Hall, Hale Road, WA15 8SP, starting at 7.30 pm. Visitors and new members are always welcome.\n\n\nCotteril Clough is a Site of Special Scientific Interest situated close to the River Bollin. It has been designated due to its ancient woodland which is among the most diverse in Greater Manchester. It is managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust.\n\n\n"}

He fought in the American Revolution and later served as United States Representative, 26th Governor of Georgia, and United States Senator. Milledge was a founder of Athens, Georgia, and the University of Georgia.\n\nJohn Milledge was born in Savannah, the grandson of an original settler of Georgia. He was tutored privately and studied law. After being admitted to the bar, he opened a law practice in Savannah. At the onset of the Revolutionary War, Milledge was part of a group that took colonial governor Sir James Wright as a prisoner in 1775. He also took part in a raid of Savannah's royal armory to procure gunpowder for the revolutionary cause. When the British captured Savannah, Milledge escaped to South Carolina, where American patriots nearly hanged him as a spy. He participated in the Siege of Savannah in an attempt to drive the British forces out. In 1778, he served as an aide to Governor John Houstoun in an abortive campaign against the British in East Florida. In 1781, as a colonel in the Georgia militia, he helped to recapture Augusta.\n\nMilledge's political career began in 1779, when he was elected to the patriot general assembly. After serving as the attorney general of Georgia, Milledge was a member of the Georgia General Assembly. While in the General Assembly, he spoke out forcefully against the Yazoo Land Acts. In 1792, the House of Representatives declared the seat of Anthony Wayne vacant due to disputes over his residency. Milledge was elected to the Second Congress to fill this vacancy and served from November 22, 1792, to March 3, 1793. Later, Milledge would be elected to the Fourth and Fifth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1795 to March 3, 1799. In 1801, he was again elected to Congress, this time as a Democratic-Republican, and served from March 4, 1801, until he resigned in May 1802 to become Governor of Georgia.\n\nMilledge was Governor of Georgia from 1802 to 1806. As governor, he created Georgia's first land lottery to combat corruption in the distribution of former Creek lands to settlers. He also reorganized the state militia, and built a road from Georgia to Tennessee passing through Cherokee lands.\n\nIn 1803, Milledgeville, Georgia, state capital from 1804 to 1868, was named in his honor.\n\nIn 1806, he was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Jackson. He was a loyal and enthusiastic supporter of the policies of President Thomas Jefferson. In the 10th United States Congress, he was named President pro tempore of the Senate. He served as a Senator from June 19, 1806, until November 14, 1809, when he resigned.\n\nWhile serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Milledge was named to a commission to establish a site for the state \nUniversity of Georgia (incorporated January 27, 1785). On July 25, 1801 Milledge bought with his own money some land on the Oconee River for the school, and named the surrounding area Athens, in honor of the city of Plato's Academy.\n\nJohn Milledge Hall (circa 1921 as a male dormitory) at the University of Georgia, now houses the Division of Academic Enhancement and the Regents' Center for Learning Disorders.\n\nAfter retiring from the United States Senate, Milledge returned home, to live out his final years at his plantation near Augusta, Georgia. He died there, February 9, 1818, and was buried in Summerville Cemetery in that same city.\n\nMilledge Avenue in Athens is named for him. Milledge Road in Augusta is also named for him.\n\nJohn Milledge Academy in Milledgeville is named for John Milledge.\n\n"}

It is found in dry pastures across much of Europe and central and northern Asia mostly on lime.\n\nThe genus name comes from Latin \"filum\" (\"thread\") and \"pendulus\" (\"hanging\") in reference to the root tubers that hang from the roots in some species. Specific epithet means common. The common English name \"dropwort\" comes from the tubers that hang like drops from the root.\n\nThe crushed leaves and roots have a scent of the oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate).\n\nIt has finely-cut, radical leaves, fern-like in appearance which form a basal rosette, and an erect stem tall bearing a loose terminal inflorescence of small creamy white flowers. The flowers appear in dense clusters from late spring to mid summer atop sparsely leafed stems about 30 cm tall.\n\nThis plant prefers full sun to partial shade. It is more tolerant of dry conditions than most other members of its genus. It is a perennial of chalk and limestone downs and on heaths on other basic rocks.\n\nPropagation is by seed and the division of the creeping roots. The tuberous roots and young leaves can be cooked as a vegetable or eaten raw as a salad. The taste is bitter sweet. Mature leaves smell of oil of wintergreen when crushed, due to the release of methyl salicylate.\n"}

The village is a dispersed cluster on the North Downs centred less than one mile inside of the M25 motorway. The village hosts the Walton Heath Golf Club, whose former members include King Edward VIII, Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George.\n\nThe M25 motorway, less than a mile from the centre, roughly marks the northern boundary of the Surrey Hills AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty); it contains the village among others and orbits London. The village except for one street is surrounded by Green Belt including farmland and protected heathland managed by the Banstead Common Conservators. Along its green buffers it borders to the north-east its post town, Tadworth and Kingswood, Headley and Box Hill. Tadworth railway station is the nearest station about from its centre which provides a commuter line into London Bridge Station. Its normal broad definition, the former civil parish, which resembles its ecclesiastical parish of ancient foundation, is in the Tadworth and Walton Ward of Reigate and Banstead Council. Across the motorway — within its long-established bounds — is the Headquarters of Pfizer UK at the business park known as The Hermitage.\nWalton-on-the-Hill has a large pond, a green, a primary school, an independent preparatory school for girls, convenience/repair shops and public houses.\n\nThe village is home to Walton Heath Golf Club, whose former members include King Edward VIII, Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George.\n\nThe Romans are known to have settled here in the 1st century AD: a substantial villa has been excavated in Sandlands Road, and is believed to have been inhabited until around 400 AD. Roman finds have been discovered here and in the neighbouring village of Headley.\n\nWalton-on-the-Hill lay within the Copthorne hundred, an administrative division devised by the Saxons.\n\nWalton-on-the-Hill was called \"Waltone\" in Domesday Book of 1086. It was held by John from Richard Fitz Gilbert. Its Domesday assets were: 2 hides and 1 virgate. It had 5½ ploughs, 1 house in Southwark. It rendered £6. There is an early post-conquest motte within the grounds of Walton Place, the remains of a timber castle.\nThe name Walton comes from settlement/farmstead of Wealas – Anglo-Saxon (Old English) for \"Celtic-speaking tribes\" or by derivation, \"strangers/foreigners\", see later form Welsh people and related old-fashioned phrases.\n\nA legal record of 1418 mentioning \"'Wauton Athill\" may refer to the village.\n\nThis is a scheduled ancient monument built at a date in period from the 11th to 13th centuries, covering a small area in Walton Place by the public road, standing 2.4 metres above the land to all sides. The manor of Walton was held by Richard de Tonbridge soon after the Norman Conquest and later by Gilbert de Clare (or Fitz Richard), both of whom are known to be prolific castle builders, but it was also owned by the Carew family in the early 17th century at which time the manor house was extensively rebuilt, who English Heritage believe therefore slightly altered it as a garden feature.\n\nThe church of St Peter partially dates to the 12th century; one of its oldest features is an 800-year-old font, constructed in lead, although this is thought to have originally stood in a chapel alongside the village's manor house, which is equally Grade II* listed. The interior of the church features examples of 16th-century artwork and stained glass. Another old church font was set up as a mounting stone outside the nearby public house.\n\nThe house has features from the 14th century onwards, though was remodelled in the 16th century and the late 19th century and has been much reduced. Some of the tilework is in the technique of Norman Shaw.\n\nLocal oral history has it that the manor house was visited by Henry VIII, and his wife Anne of Cleves is also thought to have stayed here.\n\nPharmaceutical company Pfizer's offices were built on the site of the Hermitage country house at Walton Oaks. A separate entrance leads to the remaining Hermitage Lodge and farm cottages. Local planning guidance issued in 2001 notes that at Walton Oaks the 1920 formal gardens, pond and temple by the architect Morley Horder and the adjoining rhododendron walks are of interest. The Victorian sunken garden and Georgian parkland trees of the Hermitage within the Walton Oaks site are also of interest.\n\nThere is a wide variety of housing, in size, type and age. The earliest buildings include Walton Manor with its 14th-century foundations and a number of 16th- and 17th-century properties in Walton Street and Deans Lane.\n\nCloser to the centre are smaller Victorian houses, while further out and especially to the south of the village are larger detached houses on private roads. Many of these were built in the early to mid-20th century and include designs by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and his followers. Prime Minister David Lloyd George owned one such property, Pinfold Manor on Nursery Road. On 19 February 1913, Pinfold Manor was bombed by the Women's Social and Political Union, a militant suffragette group led by Emmeline Pankhurst. The house was repaired and still stands today. \n\nIn the centre of the village are more recent developments of flats, including retirement flats. Bramley School, an independent day school for girls aged three to eleven was located in the village. but closed in 2017.\n\nSt Cross was a large building to the north of the village which was formerly a boys' school. From 1948 it was a British Transport Police Training Centre with a police dog training school.

It has religious significance, and has a cross at its top.\n\nThe last name Matteis is an Italian surname that is quite common in some Italian regions like Campania in Southern Italy, Lazio in Central Italy, and Piemonte in Northern Italy while it is less common in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna (Central Italy) and in Lombardia (Northern Italy).\n\nThe Matteis surname can be found in 48 Italian towns, whereas De Matteis which has the same origin is much more common and is present in 464 towns all over Italy, though it originates in Puglia (Southern Italy).\n\nAs for the origin of Matteis, it derives from the Latin name Mattheus (Matteo in Italian, Matthew in English) used in the ablative plural Mattheis and then Matteis in Italian or De Matteis meaning literally “belonging to the family of Matteo” as both Matteis and De Matteis which end in the Latin ablative “–eis” mean that someone was son/daughter of a certain Matteo which was the ancestor of this family.\n\nThe name Matteis can be found in other parts of Europe, including Germany and England. This is probably due to migration out of Italy. Matteis families in Germany most likely are a result of the Matteis families in the Piemonte region of Italy moving North. Some Matteis families can be found in England and other parts of Europe. For example, the violinist Nicola Matteis traveled to London in the early 1670s. Still, most families can be found in Italy, where the name originated.\n\n\"Parentalia, inquam, unde Idololatriae malum caput extulit erroris.

Initially, Khatami had considered not running for reelection. But, after months of his supporters and party members pleading with him, he finally decided to declare his candidacy two months before the start of the election. Central to Khatami's campaign were the issues of economic revival, job growth, and democratic reform. Khatami also sought to restore the austerity of the Iranian Revolution.

Until the late 19th century the town was known as Toscanella.\n\nAccording to the legend, Tuscania was founded by Aeneas' son, Ascanius, where he had found twelve dog pups (whence the Etruscan name \"Tus\"-\"Cana\", \"cana\" being similar to Latin \"canis\" for \"dog\"). Another legend attributes the foundation to one Tusco, son of Hercules and Araxes.\n\nEvidence of human presence in the area dates from the Neolithic age, but probably the city proper was founded in the 7th century BC when the acropolis on St. Peter's Hill was surrounded by a line of walls. Villages existed in the vicinity. In the following years its strategic position gave Tuscania a leading role in the Etruscan world. After the defeat of the coastal cities by the Greeks (4th century BC), Tuscania also became a maritime trade centre through the port of \"Regas\" (next to today's Montalto di Castro).\nThere is no record of Tuscania being involved in the battles that led to the Roman conquest of the Etruscan northern Lazio (280 BC), as the city probably entered into the Roman orbit peacefully. The agricultural development and construction of the Via Clodia further boosted the economic situation of the city. It became a \"municipium\" in 88 BCE.\n\nIn the 5th century AD (or earlier, depending on the source), Tuscania became one of the first bishopric sees in Italy.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it fell to the Lombards in 569 or 574. In 781 it became part of the Papal States. In 967–1066 it was a fief of the Anguillara family and then of the marquises of Tuscany. In 1081 it was besieged by Emperor Henry IV.\nIn the following century it became a free commune with authority over a wide territory including numerous castles. The inner struggles within Tuscania led to a loss of prestige, in favour of the nearby Viterbo, which was made a diocese in 1192, formally on split-off territory, but virtually achieved a transfer by immediate, constant personal union under Viterbo's bishops until the 1896 former merger of the Tuscania bishopric (as it had been renamed in 1911) into the Viterbo diocese. In 1222 St. Francis of Assisi sojourned in the city.\nDuring the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines throughout the Holy Roman Empire, it was captured by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen on March 2, 1240, and provided with a line of walls.\n\nA failed military expedition against Pope Boniface VIII (early 14th century), led to the submission to Rome, with the pejorative name of Tuscanella. In 1348–49 a bubonic plague struck Tuscania very hard. Shortly thereafter, in 1354, Cardinal Gil Alvarez De Albornoz definitively returned the town to the Papal States.\n\nIn 1421 it became a county under the condottiero Angelo Broglio da Lavello.\nIn 1495 it was ravaged by the French troops of King Charles VIII during his march towards the Kingdom of Naples, much thanks to the destruction of the walls ordered by Cardinal Giovanni Vitelleschi in reply to the continual internecine struggles and public riots. Thereafter the city experienced a long decline which lasted until the annexation to the new unified Kingdom of Italy in 1870.\n\nIn the 19th century the local Campanari family spearheaded the exploration of Etruscan tombs. They organized the first Etruscan exhibition in London. Many of the valuable discoveries ended up in various European museums, as well as Tuscania's own Archeological Museum.\n\nOn February 6, 1971 an earthquake caused 31 deaths. The town has been meticulously restored since, and the historic quarter is substantial, completely surrounded by the medieval city walls that offer excellent views over the surrounding countryside and the church of St Peter.\n\nThe main attraction of the city is the Church of San Pietro, built in Lombard-Romanesque style, begun in the 8th century and renovated in the 11th-12th centuries. The interior has a nave and two aisles divided by low columns and pilasters incorporating half-columns, with antique and mediaeval capitals.\nOther sights include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2051275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051275", "title": "Bago, Negros Occidental", "text": "Bago, Negros Occidental\n\n', officially the ', (; ) or simply Bago City, is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated some south of the provincial capital Bacolod, Bago City comprises 6.63% of the population of the entire Negros Occidental, making it the third most populous city in the province. It sets a land area of 389 square kilometres, which is 5% of the entire Negros Occidental and 10% of the total land area of component cities.\n\nIt is also tagged as the “Home of Historical and Natural Treasures”, owing to its contribution to the history of the province of Negros Occidental and country, and its scenery and flora and fauna making it an eco-tourism destination. It is also known as the “Boxing Capital of the Philippines” title, owing to the great names it produced in boxing. It is also home to the only three known populations of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin in the entire Philippines. The other two populations are in Guimaras and Palawan. All of which are designated as critically endangered populations.\n\nThe community was named after a large tree called \"“Bágo”\" (gnetum gnemon) under which a native prince Mapagic died according to the writings of a Spanish historian, Diego de Povedano. Another version, however, noted that the name came from the shrub, \"bago-bago\" that grew abundantly in the riverbanks. Around the 17th and 18th Centuries, settlers from Molo, Iloilo formed a little village at the mouth of Bago River, presently a rich source of sand and gravel. The village grew into a large settlement prompting its elders to pass a petition for its conversion into a town or \"pueblo\", which was granted in 1800.\n\nIts history has its beginning on September 6, 1571 when the Spanish Adelantado, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, allotted the community to a Spaniard named Juan Gutierrez Cortes as his \"\"encomienda\"\". At that time, the community was still composed of small clusters of settlements along the banks of a big river which later became known as the Bago River. The \"\"encomiendero\"\", since then, administered to the spiritual and socio-economic needs of the natives in the settlements until June, 1578; however, a year before that, this community was placed under the evangelical visitations of Father Geronimo Marin, an Augustinian priest who had taken charge of the Christianization of the natives of Binalbagan since the year 1572. Father Marin, upon his arrival in the community, celebrated the feast of St. John the Baptist, who would later be accepted as the patron saint of the place. Following the traditions and practices of the Spanish missionaries and historians in recording the founding of a \"\"pueblo\"\" or town that usually coincides with the feast day of a saint and since the feast day of St. John the Baptist, falls on June 24 of each year, it follows thereof that Bago was founded on June 24, 1575. History only records 1575 as the year when Bago was founded so that the exact month and day can only be deduced from such traditional practices of the Spaniards. Manila, Cebu and Binalbagan also predicted the dates of their founding on the same historical situations; hence, the logical conclusion is that Bago City was officially founded on the month, day and year heretofore mentioned.\n\nAs regards on how the community acquired its name, according to the manuscript of a Spanish historian, Diego Lope de Povedano, which is available in the library of the University of San Carlos, Cebu City, the community was named after a large tree called \"\"Bago\"\" under which, a native prince by the name of Mapagic died.\n\nAnother historical version is that the place got its name from a shrub called \"\"bago-bago\"\" which was then growing luxuriantly along the river banks.\n\nFrom the year 1575 up to the close of the 16th century, no historical account was written about the community. Bago came into the historical scene again when, at early part of the 17th century, a group of settlers settled along the banks of Bago River. The arrival of these settlers merged into a sizable village capable of self- governance. In later years, the descendants of these settlers petitioned the Spanish authorities to declare their village a \"pueblo\" or town and to name it \"Bago\". Among the petitioners were Manuel Sitchon, Gregorio Varela, Paulino Torres, Jacinto Araneta, Clemente Celis, Mariano Gonzaga and Fernando Villanueva, whose forebears hailed from the town of Molo, lloilo. The said petition was finally granted by the Spanish authorities in the year 1800; thus, Bago officially attained the status of a \"pueblo\" or town in that same year.\n\nBetween the years 1800 and 1898, the inhabitants of Bago are among those who suffered tremendously under the Spanish tyranny, injustice and oppression. This social condition finally led to a great revolt on November 5, 1898 when on this day, General Juan Anacleto Araneta rallied his people in the struggle for freedom. This historic event was chronicled in a historical marker found in the city public plaza of Bago which bears the following inscriptions:\n\nRepublica de Negros\n\nTogether with General Aniceto Lacson who led the forces in Talisay, he was able to force the capitulation of the Spanish garrison at Bacolod thus putting an end to the Spanish sovereignty in the province. Forthwith, a revolutionary government was established with General Juan A. Araneta as the Acting Governor. The Municipality of Bago, an election was held and Ramon del Castillo became the first elected municipal president who served in such capacity from the year 1898 up to the year 1900.\n\nIn April, 1901, the Americans came and established a civil government in the province of Negros Occidental which completely abolished the revolutionary government of General Araneta. Bago as one of the towns that were placed under the control of the Americans; however, they allowed the municipality to be governed by Filipino officials.\n\nWhen the Japanese forces invaded the Philippines, the civil government of Bago was dissolved. The Japanese occupation forces tried to establish a provisional government but the local people refused to cooperate. When the joint American and Filipino forces including recognized guerrillas liberated the town on March 29, 1945, it was completely destroyed but rehabilitation work was immediately started.\n\nBago City was finally granted its cityhood on February 19, 1966, by virtue of Republic Act. No. 4382 with Manuel Y. Torres as the hold-over City Mayor until 1998.\n\nLegal limitations on the number of successive terms disqualified Mayor Manuel Y. Torres in running again as city mayor and in the 1998 local elections, his wife, Janet e.Torres run as candidate for mayor and won. Mayor Janet served Bago City as city mayor for three consecutive terms.\n\nPresently, the City of Bago is under the leadership of Mayor Nicholas Yulo.\n\nOn July 27, 2018 the city of Bago was awarded at Gawad Kalasag 2018 City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management as 1st Placer under Independent Component City Category.\n\nBago City has a total land area of 38,941 hectares, 3,651 ha. of which belongs to Mt.

Cadiz traces its beginnings to the establishment of a traditional settlement in a place known as Cadiz Viejo, near the banks of the Hitalon River. Historical records showed that in 1861, the Spaniards came and named the settlement Cadiz because of its northern location which reminded them of the seaport by the same name in Spain.\n\nCadiz became a municipality independent from Saravia (now E.B. Magalona) in 1878. Its first appointed Gobernadorcillo was Antonio Cabahug, married to Capitana Francisca Cito. The outbreak of the Spanish–American War saw Cadiz take part in the insurrection. Her sons and daughters, headed by Francisco Abelarde, took up arms against their Spanish masters.\n\nDuring the short-lived government of the cantonal state of the Federal Republica de Negros, Jose Lopez Vito was elected its president. At the onset of American rule, Cadiz was on its way to prosperity with the operation of two lumber companies in the area. The war years stopped these economic activities and brought much suffering to the people of Cadiz. The resistance movement and the local forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units put up the civil government in the mountains to deal with civilian affairs. In the post-war election of 1952, Joaquin Ledesma was elected mayor.\n\nIn July 1967, Cadiz was inaugurated as a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 4894 which was passed by Congress on June 17, 1967.

A brief sample of the constructed language is found in an addendum to More's book, written by his friend Peter Giles. Pretending to be factual, the book does not name the creator of the language; both More and Giles have been alternately credited, with Giles often thought to have designed the alphabet.\n\nAlthough some words in Utopian show different forms corresponding to different cases in the Latin translation, there is no evidence of a consistent relationship between form and meaning, as can be seen from the following comparison of the nominal, pronominal, and adjectival case forms:\n\nThere are only four verbs in the Utopian poem, and these also show no evidence of a correspondence between form and function:\n\nUtopian has its own 22-letter alphabet, with letters based on the shapes of the circle, square, and triangle. These correspond almost exactly to the 23-letter Roman alphabet used in the 16th century, lacking only \"z\". The letters f, k, q, and x only appear in the alphabet, not in the Utopian text.\n\nThe only extant text in Utopian is a quatrain written by Peter Giles in an addendum to \"Utopia\":\n\nIt is translated literally into Latin as:\n\nThis, in turn, is translated into English as follows:\n\nArmed with these translations, it is possible to deduce the following vocabulary:\n\nIn accordance with 16th-century typographical custom, the letters v and u marked a distinction in position, not sound; v was used at the beginnings of words and u elsewhere, but the same letters could represent the sounds of either u or v. Analysis of the metre of the verse shows, however, that the reader was expected to read Vtopos as \"Utopos\", voluala as \"volvala\", and lauoluola as \"lavolvola\".\n\nMore's text also contains Utopian \"native\" terms for Utopian concepts.\n\n"}

{"id": "2051288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051288", "title": "Cauayan, Negros Occidental", "text": "Cauayan, Negros Occidental\n\n', officially the ' (; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nCauayan is about from the provincial capital of Bacolod City and is known for its sandy beaches and pristine waters, limestone and dried fish products. With a population of 102,165 inhabitants, it is the most-populated out of the 19 municipalities in Negros Occidental.\n\nLong before the Spaniards came to Negros, this town was a wilderness and primitive people depended on hunting and fishing for a living. The town was covered with bamboo thickets called \"Kawayan\" in the local dialect, hence the name \"Cauayan\".\n\nIn 1822, Cauayan was formally founded by Don Vicente Paulo Decena, believed to have come from Cebu. He was enticed into Cauayan by the legendary beauty of a native girl who subsequently became his wife, and Don Vicente Paulo Decena's family is still living in Cauayan and it is making its progress with their help.\n\nDuring the Spanish era, a seat for the municipal government was sought. Guiljungan, Cauayan and Isio were candidates but Isio prevailed as it was more populated. It got the honor of being the center of government although gobernadorcillos were accorded to Cauayan and Guiljungan.\n\nNot much progress happened to the town at that time since the Spanish rulers were reluctant to educate their subjects. Even when they built schools, only a few privileged were admitted to them. There were no roads and most people were required to render forced labor.\n\nAll these changed when the Americans came in 1904. The tribunal in Isio was shifted to Cauayan and this fostered development. The natives were taught modern ways to raise crops, and schoolhouses, roads and bridges were constructed. Not even the Japanese occupation could disrupt the development of the town since then.\n\nLocated on the southern portion of the province, Cauayan is bounded on the east by the municipality of Ilog; on the south by the municipality of Candoni; on the west by the mining city of Sipalay and on the north by the Panay Gulf with its bountiful fishing grounds.\n\nThe municipality of Cauayan has a rugged topography. Mt. Malipantao, considered the highest peak in the province, separates the municipality from the town of Candoni and the city of Sipalay. Portion of the ranges are the remaining thick forest that needs protection where the watershed is located. The remaining portions of the municipality are slightly rolling to moderate large areas of flat lands center on the different barrios, which is much suited to agriculture.\n\nThe municipality consists mainly of the following slope distribution:\n\nFrom gently sloping at 0-3 percent or equivalent to 5,369.42 hectares to moderately sloping at 3-8 percent or a total of 1,059.40 hectares to rolling lands with slopes ranging from 8-18 percent which covers to about 1,716.94 hectares. A bigger portion is moderately steep with a slope distribution ranging from 18-30 percent having a total area of 19,419.42 hectares. However, large areas are steep and mountains with a slope of 30-50 percent, which accounts to 21,181.92 hectares, and to very steep hills and mountains with a slope of over 50 percent, which covers to about 3,246.90 hectares. Moderately large areas of flat land center on the different barrios. However, the southern part of the municipality is hilly. The Poblacion and the 12 barangays along the seashore are approximately 0-3 degrees above sea level.\n\nThe Municipality of Cauayan is made up of 25 barangays, categorized into the Coastal and the Upland Barangays.\n\nTourism has recently picked up in the Cauayan Municipality, with its fine white sand beaches and diverse marine and wildlife.\n\nPunta Bulata White Beach Resort, the most developed resort in the area, with an AA accreditation from the Department of Tourism, has seen tourists from all parts of the world who come to relax, bask in the tropical atmosphere and enjoy the marine life that is among the best in the country.\n\nDanjugan Island Marine Reserve is a wildlife sanctuary in Barangay Bulata is also one of the most recognized dive spots in the region. Once featured on the cover of Mabuhay Magazine, this island has one of the most diverse and highly dense coral life in the world, comparable to the Great Barrier Reef. Visitors may go for day-trips to the island with pre-arranged visits by contacting Danjugan Island or through Punta Bulata Resort.\n\nThe Lubay-lubay Festival and Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul is held annually on January 25.\n\nThe main concern of the Local Government Unit of Cauayan is the provision of adequate health facilities and services to its constituents. The Rural Health Unit in the Poblacion is supported by 24 Barangay Health Stations and 22 sub-stations located in the different barangays. Complementing the health services is the newly operated Cauayan District Hospital managed by the Local Government Unit located in Barangay Isio. Services offered include medical consultation, maternal and child care, immunization, control of diarrheal diseases, control of acute respiratory infection, family planning, nutrition, tuberculosis control, leprosy control, dental health, rabies control, malaria control, sexually transmitted disease control, AIDS prevention, cancer control, dengue control, cardiovascular disease prevention and control, prevention of blindness, environmental sanitation and care of the elderly.\n\nThe Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office is charged with the function of accelerating delivery of social services in the municipality. The target outreach for welfare services is generally classified as follows: family heads, children, out-of-school youths, disabled, special groups, distressed families and rebel returnees.\n\nSocial services are rendered to Family Heads and Other Needy Adults (FHONA), needy children, youth, disabled/elderly, women, and the distressed. Social programs include Self-Employment Assistance Program, day care and supplemental feeding, Emergency Assistance, Self-Employment Assistance, Relief Assistance, and Responsible Parenthood/Pre-Marriage Counseling. Cauayan also offers social services like Child Abuse, Youthful Offenders, Peer Group Services, Organization of Elderly Groups, Organization of Barangay Council for Protection of Children, and Organization of Barangay Disaster Coordinating Council.\n\nThe municipality police force has a total strength of 28 members who maintain the peace and order and assist with emergencies. It is complemented by the 4th Mobile Coy PNP or Provincial Mobile Group (PMG) in maintaining peace and order especially in the campaign against subversives and lawless elements in the town and nearby municipalities. This is further augmented by the 61st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army based in Barangay Tiling.\n\nThe municipality can be reached through public utility buses and jeeps plying the route Bacolod-Cauayan-Sipalay-Hinoba-an with terminals in Bacolod City and sub-terminals in Kabankalan City on a scheduled basis. Transportation facilities plying the route from the Kabankalan to the different barangays and vice versa are public utility jeeps with terminals in other growth centers aside from Poblacion. There are about 525 units of public tricycles being utilized for short distance travel.\n\nThe municipality has a total road length of 298 kilometers. Of this, barangay roads constitute 70.57 percent or an aggregate of 210.29 kilometers. Most of the barangay roads are still unpaved with a total of 192.98 kilometers categorized under the gravel road surface. Only 2.31 kilometers and three kilometers are of concrete and asphalt, respectively. Ranked next is the national road with a total of 64 kilometers or about 21.5 percent. Of the total, 62 kilometers are concrete asphalt and the remaining two kilometers as concrete road surface. The provincial roads, on the other hand, comprise 20.5 kilometers or equivalent to only 6.9 percent of the total road length where 17 kilometers are still classified under the gravel road surface. The municipal roads represent about 1.1 percent or a total of 3.21 kilometers; they are all of concrete surface and basically service the urban center with a total projected population of 7,096.\n\nThe municipality has no land line telephone connections. The only available facilities are the two telephone franchise holders or public calling offices: Philippine Long Distance Telephone Office (PLDT-PCO) and Bayan Telephone Services.\n\nMailing services are mainly handled by the Bureau of Posts which is headed by a postmaster and two postmen. Other telecommunication services are the municipal radio station and the PC/PNP radio station with their citizens band radio operated by the office of the mayor and the PC/PNP, respectively. The former is engaged in communication services to and from the provincial offices and other municipal offices, while the latter specializes in communication services directly related to peace and order radio messages.\n\nOne of the major sources of power is the Negros Occidental Electric Cooperative (NOCECO), which started providing electric power in September 1982. It only covers six barangays; however, with an increasing population, the demand for electric power is also increasing. As a result, out of 25 barangays, 23 are already energized. The remaining two barangays settled down to kerosene, which is still widely used by the remaining 73 percent of the total number of potential consumers who are not served by the electric cooperative.\n\nThere are two levels of water supply in the municipality. Level I refers to point sources of water such as wells, springs and rain collectors. Level II refers to communal faucet systems. The municipality is deficient in the point of piped potable water available for residential and commercial purposes.\n\nThere are 18 existing waterworks system under the Level II water system found in 18 barangays with one faucet in every cluster of houses, or a total of 386 faucets. Except for Barangay Inayawan, which is operated by the cooperative, the rest are managed by the Barangay Council. Since the municipality is still generally rural, the local waterworks system uses communal faucets where houses are densely clustered enough to justify a piped distribution system providing a number of households with faucets. In other barangays, household consumers pay a flat rate at a minimum of P10.00 per month while others operate their water system for free.\n\nThe municipality is divided into two school districts, Cauayan I and Cauayan II, which offer complete elementary and secondary education. It also offers non-formal education to out-of-school youths. There are in the municipality 62 elementary schools. 31 have complete elementary education and the remaining 30 schools only cater to primary education. From these 62 elementary schools, 21 are located along the highway, some are near the seacoast, and the rest are widely scattered in the mountainous area of the municipality.\n\nFor secondary education, there are seven main national high schools and three private secondary schools. Among the excelling schools are Guiljungan National High School, Tuyom National High School, Eva J Montilla National High School and Camalandaan National High School, which cater quality education. Students have competitively participated in divisional and regional conferences from these schools and honorarily brag awards.\n\nTo further provide the educational and/or tertiary needs of the Cauayanons, through the municipal government's Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Negros Occidental Agriculture College (NOAC), now Negros Occidental State College of Agriculture (NESCA) - Cauayan Campus was officially opened last June 8, 1999.\n\n"}

{"id": "2051293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051293", "title": "Escalante, Negros Occidental", "text": "Escalante, Negros Occidental\n\n', officially the ', or simply referred to as City, is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nVirtually nothing is known of Escalante during the pre-Hispanic era. But archaeological findings in October 1975 and May 1976 made by a team of Anthropology students led by Professor Lionel Chiong of Silliman University reveal an early record of men who inhabited not only the present city but also the island of Negros during the pre-Spanish time. The findings were recovered in nine (9) graves in what seemed to be an ancient burial ground in Barangay Japitan, a coastal barangay lying along the Tañon Strait, facing the island of Cebu, some 17 kilometers from the city proper. The artifacts consisted of celadon plate and bowls, stoneware bowls and jars, a Sung Dynasty (960-1280 A.D.) jarlet, gold beads, iron implements, daggers and a hunting knife with an ivory bone handle.\n\nObviously buried with the dead, the plate, bowls, jars and iron implements were found alongside the skeletal remains, the daggers and hunting knives on top of the breast section and the gold beads inside the skulls in-between the upper and lower jaws. When carbon-14 tested, these findings together with the human skeletal remains were found to date as far back as the 12th century A.D. All this proved that present-day Escalante was inhabited by settlers with a relatively developed culture who were engaged in some form of trade and commerce with the outside world, such as the Chinese and Japanese traders who could have brought the jarlet, stoneware and celadon pieces during the Ages of Contacts and Trade with the East (11th & 12th centuries A.D.)\n\nThe northeastern part of Negros Island was \"one of the most cultivated regions\" in the mid-19th century.\n\nOn November 28, 1856, Governor-General Manuel Crespo issued a decree creating the towns of Escalante and Saravia. The decree ordered \"that the two towns in question would be separated immediately from their mother town, Silay,\" although the spiritual separation of the two \"would await the building of churches and convents in Saravia and Escalante.\" The latter had its seat of government in the barrio of Nueva Sevilla (Barangay Old Poblacion).\n\nThe Parish of Escalante was finally established on May 22, 1860 with Fr. Cipriano Navarro, OAR, as the first Parish Priest. Fr. Navarro, in a report to the Recollect Provincial in 1861, wrote that the inhabitants of his Parish and its 14 barrios lying along the northeast portion of the island from Calatrava to Himogaan, \"speak the Cebuano dialect and all, or the majority, came from Cebu, with the exception of those from Barrio Marianas (Himogaan) . . . who came from the district of Iloilo and speak the Hiligaynon dialect.\"\n\nIn 1859, a politico-Military Command was established in Bacolod under Governor Emilio E. Saravia with six towns under its jurisdiction: Escalante, Guihulngan, Jinuboan, Jimalalud, Tayasan, and Ayungon. Two more were added, Arguelles (Sagay) and Calatrava when these were created into separate towns on July 3, 1863. This ended with the division of Negros into two provinces in 1889.\n\nSchools for boys and girls were established in the late 1860s. By 1869 a school for boys and another for girls were already operating in the town. By 1890, these schools were among the very few managed by Normal School graduates.\n\nAs early as 1871, Escalante was a major link between Bacolod and Cebu. A mail service route, Bacolod-Escalante-Tutuban-Toledo, Cebu was already exclusively in use by May 1871. In 1875 a mail boat belonging to Emerenciano Amante, the Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) of Escalante, transported mail between Toledo and Escalante every week.\n\nA telegraphic station was established in 1894. The telegraphic cable was extended later on to Tuburan, Cebu and was operational by October 1897.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town lived from subsistence agriculture. They produced among others, rice, corn, buri, edible root crops, and tobacco. Their second most important economic activity was fishing.\n\nTobacco was grown commercially but its production decreased when monopoly was established starting from the time of Don Emilio Saravia (1855–1857), the first politico-military of the Negros Island. In its stead, sugarcane was gradually being grown. It was not clear when the first sugar mill was established in town. But by 1891, Escalante had already 6 steam-engine sugar mills; 36 powered by horses; and 11 by carabaos. Approximately 848 hectares were planted to sugarcane..\n\nThe American period covering some 45 years (December, 1898 to July 3, 1946, except for a few years under the Japanese occupation) saw marked changes in the socio-cultural, economic and political complexion of the area and its people. To capture the hearts and minds of the inhabitants without the use of guns and cannons, the Americans opened the first free elementary school at Old Poblacion in the early 1900s.\n\nA Gabaldon-type elementary school building was constructed at Old Poblacion during the term of Mayor Fernando Lucot (1912–1918). The municipal hall and the town plaza were constructed and developed during the time of Francisco Ferrer, Sr. Also at this time, the first municipal school site where the first elementary school was located, was formally acquired, and the installation of the Rizal Monument at the public plaza completed. The municipal portal and Rizal Monument was built on Sept. 15, 1955. The bandstand and skating rink was constructed on September 28, 1935.\n\nIn 1942, the occupation by the Japanese Imperial forces entered the towns in Escalante. The establishment of the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and the 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active again on October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946 and military stationed in the town municipality of Escalante during the Japanese Occupation.\n\nIn 1945, local Filipino soldiers of the 7th, 72nd, 75th and 76th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated the towns in Escalante, Negros Occidental and helping Negrosanon guerrilla fighters defeats and attacking Japanese Imperial forces and ended of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1941, Victor Bedonia succeeded Francisco Ferrer Sr. as mayor, and was supported by the local guerillas. The siege of all Filipino troops of the Philippine Army and Constabulary units was found liberated in the town municipality on 1945 against the Japanese. He served until 1948. The Japanese however installed Enrique Ballesteros as mayor until the end of the war.\n\nTwo (2) years after liberation, Escalante was divided into two (2) municipalities. President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order 141 dated May 19, 1948 \"Organizing certain barrios of the Municipality of Escalante, Province of Negros Occidental, into an independent municipality under the name Toboso\", to take effect July 1, 1948. Victor Bedonia who was then the incumbent mayor of Escalante opted to become the first mayor of the newly created town of Toboso. Pedro Benignos took over until 1950. In 1951, Evaristo Sanz took over and was replaced thereafter by Amando Tambo. It was during Mayor Tambo’s time when the seat of government, by virtue of Executive Order No. 301 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia on May 30, 1958, was transferred from Barangay Old Poblacion to its present site at Barangay Balintawak.\n\nThe first high school, the Escalante National High School, was donated by Manuel A. Lopez in 1946 and established in 1948. A decade later, in 1961, the Mount Carmel College was established by the Order of the Carmelites. Aside from the churches in the Municipality of Toboso, in Escalante and in Brgy Old. Poblacion, it also erected the Magdalen Hospital which was run by the Sisters of Julie Postel. This hospital is now called the Dr. Vicente Gustilo District Hospital, under the management of the Provincial Government. This placed the new town in an enviable position, not only being a center of higher education and quality medical care in this part of Negros.\n\nThis brought about profound changes in the socio-cultural, economic and political life of the town as it provided the much-needed opportunity for children of poor families in the area to acquire college education. Other public schools were opened up later on, such that there are now 27 public elementary schools, 6 national public high schools and 3 extension high schools.\n\nDuring this time, a modern public market, new municipal building, and the 50,000-gallon reservoir was erected under the mayor Braulio P. Lumayno. The Martial Law Years was seemingly quiet. However, the uneven land distribution, marginal food production, and the excesses of the political system created so much discontent especially in the sugarcane farms. This was one of the reasons why the BAYAN-led \"Welgang Bayan\" which ended in the Escalante massacre. Twenty-one rallyists who were determined to paralyze traffic, died on the spot on the streets of Escalante when the militia of then-strongman Congressman Armando Gustilo, who was bent on dispersing the rally, fired their guns on rallyists. This event was one of the important factors for the downfall of the Marcos regime.\n\nWith the installation of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Mrs. Evelyn L. Hinolan was selected as OIC Mayor. Then BAYAN Chairman Rolando Ponsica, who was one of the persecuted during the Martial Law years, easily became the mayor in 1988.\n\nAfter 143 years of existence as a municipality, under the leadership of Mayor Santiago G. Barcelona, Jr., Escalante was now qualified to become a city. On July 24, 1998, the Sangguniang Bayan of Escalante passed Resolution No. 98-79 \"requesting the Congressman Julio A. Ledesma IV of the 1st District of Negros Occidental to file a bill in Congress creating / converting the Municipality of Escalante into a new City of Escalante.\" Six days later, Congressman Ledesma filed House Bill No. 1514 \"An act converting the Municipality of Escalante into a component city to be known as the City of Escalante.\" In spite of a moratorium on the creation of cities imposed by the Malacañang in 1999.\n\nCongress went ahead with its enactment. After conducting a public hearing right here in the town on November 27, 1999, Congress passed the substitute bill, House Bill No. 8882, on second reading on December 9, 1999. More than a week later, it passed the bill on third and final reading.\n\nA similar bill, Senate Bill No. 1786, was filed by Sen. Serge Osmeña III in the House of the Senate on October 22, 1999. Senate Bill No. 2245 (in substitution of Senate Bill No. 1786) was passed on third and final reading on February 8, 2001, the last session of the 11th Congress.\n\nBoth bills became Republic Act No. 9014, \"An act converting the Municipality of Escalante, Province of Negros Occidental into a component city to be known as the City of Escalante.\" It was signed into law on February 28, 2001 by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and was ratified in a plebiscite held on March 31, 2001. Of 14,723 who actually voted, 14,075 voted \"YES\" and only 648 voted \"NO\".\n\nEscalante has a total land area of . It is located on the northeastern tip of Negros Occidental, facing the island of Cebu. It is from San Carlos City and from Bacolod City, the provincial capital. It is bounded on the north and west by the city of Sagay, on the south by the town of Toboso and on the east by the Tañon Strait.\n\nOutside the city center of Escalante, there is a separate region of low rolling hills, especially going to its upland barangays towards Mt. Lunay. The hill land section is the remnant of past volcanism and probably, represents either dormant volcanic cinder cones or outliers of a once more extensive volcanic formation. Local residents in the upland barangays of Escalante at the foot of Mt. Lunay testify to period rumblings of a volcano generally believed 'to be dead'. An indicator of the dormant character of Mt. Lunay is the existence to this day of a sulphur spring at its foot. Often, the slopes of these hills as in Barangay Binaguiohan are quite steep. However, the steepness of the slope has not stopped Escalantehanons in cultivation of the hillside.\n\nThe diversity of plants in the coastal environment of Escalante is one of the richest in Occidental Negros. Its coasts comprise two surviving ecosystems: the mangrove, consisting of trees and shrubs that occupies the landward portion of its coastal areas; the seagrass, or grasslike plants, that thrive on it shallow nearshore area. In a limited coastal zone, remnants of a third ecosystem, coral reef may be found but in residual, degraded form. The marine waters of Escalante are generally warm throughout the year, except for early mornings of the cool months of December, January and February. Salinity of its waters is within reasonable amount, at 28-36 parts per thousand.\n\nThe atmospheric conditions influencing the climate of Escalante as a whole are the same conditions operative in Negros Island. During the summer months (April to December) an air stream is directed from the south. This air current follows a counterclockwise path as it approaches the low-pressure center of the Asian continent, and reaches the Philippines from a southwestern direction as the southwestern monsoon or \"habagat\". During the period from November to January, Negros has relatively cool weather as the Asian continent cools more rapidly than the surrounding seas, resulting in high-pressure centers leading to winds being deflected in a clockwise fashion.\n\nThis period is known as the northeastern monsoon or \"amihan\". From March to April the northeastern wind system dominates. The cool season in Escalante is from December through March. It is also the time when low tides called \"aya-ay\" prevail, making beachcombing of its shores more pleasurable. The latter part of March through June is when the highest temperatures prevail. But being largely coastal, Escalante enjoys a constant flow of refreshing sea breeze.\n\nEscalante City is politically subdivided into 21 barangays. The following table shows its corresponding population, area, and distance from the city proper.\n\nThe city has grown at a respectably fast rate, averaging 1.63% in the ten years (2000 thru 2010). The May 2010 Census on Population showed that population increased to 93,005 persons. This means that on average that population grew by 1.63% annually since 2000. This is only about 3.20% of the province’s population which includes Bacolod City or 3.88% without it. At this rate, the city’s population is expected to double by year 2053.\n\nThe average household for 2000 was 4.89 persons per household, which is lower than the 5.0 national, 5.1 regional and the 5.24 provincial averages. NSO estimates there were 92,035 persons in 2007 in 18,644 households. This means, the average households size increased to 4.94.\n\nAs of December 2009, the average age is 24 years old.\n\nEscalante has the highest population density (persons/square kilometer) in 2007, among the provinces's cities at 736.3, second only to the provincial capital, Bacolod City.

It is the only city in the 5th District of Negros Occidental.\n\nThe term \"\"Himamaylan\"\" is a portmanteau of the two Hiligaynon words \"hima\" and \"babaylan\". It is alleged that the settlement's early Malay inhabitants suffered from a foot malady called \"hima\", and their employment of witch doctors called \"babaylan\" caused the Spanish occupiers to call them \"Himamaylan\".\n\nIn 1795, Himamaylan became the capital of Negros.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the southernmost town of the province. It is bounded on the north by Sipalay City and Candoni; on the south by Basay, Negros Oriental; on the east by the town of Ilog; and on the west by the Sulu Sea. The total land area of Hinoba-an is 421.50 square kilometers.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Minagahat language\", the indigenous language of Southern Negros as listed by the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino. The language is vital to the culture and arts of the people.\n\nFormerly a part of Cauayan, Hinoba-an was inhabited by natives called \"Magabat\". When immigrants from Panay came and settled in the coastal areas, the settlers began to group in the area where the town is now located. Traders visited to barter products like clothing made in Miag-ao, Tigbauan and Guimbal in Iloilo.\n\nSpanish authorities did not occupy Hinoba-an during their time in the province since the area was still a jungle. It was visited only by people from Cauayan and the neighboring towns for hunting purposes, hence no important events were recorded about the coming of the Spaniards in the town until the early 20th century.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Don Estanislao Bilbao, a Basque émigré and patriarch of the Bilbao clan---one of the area's prominent families, begun a decades-long process of settling an area south of where Hinoba-an would come to be. In a few years, a significant plot of land had been rehabilitated to which thousands of germinating coconut husks were planted in precise rows. Maturing and bearing crop in under a decade, once coastal wilderness was transformed into copra producing land. Paddy fields were likewise developed further inland close to irrigation sources.\n\nThe subsequent grant of landownership, along with the total absence of government due to the area's remoteness, it became the basis for Don Estanislao's provisional administration of the people and the place. He became the area's primary, if not for a time, sole employer. As a matter of moral imperative and practical necessity, he also became the de facto Judge and Sheriff, adjudicating upon and enforcing common law.\n\nThrough his marriage to Felicidad Rivas—a patrician heiress to a similarly homesteaded parcel of land nearby, Don Estanislao doubled the size of the holding. Hand-in-hand with Dona Felicidad, they lorded over a highly productive agricultural expanse that, from points north to south, ostensibly stretched for miles on end. The couple's lifelong beneficence and philanthropy endeared them to the local populace making the Bilbao name well-respected and well-loved. Generations of offspring have since reaped the fruits of their enduring legacy. A few have gone on to build legacies of their own. Sons Joaquin and Francisco, and daughter-in-law Teresa, have each been elected town's mayor. Today, the Bilbao's have governed the municipality for a collective span of over thirty years.\n\nWhen the Americans landed in Negros during World War II, Hinoba-an became a historical point of entry by the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces. Col. Salvador Abcede, district commander of the 7th military district, established his island headquarters in this town during the Japanese occupation.\n\nCol. Jesús A. Villamor, aboard submarine USS Gudgeon (SS-211), landed at Ubong Point and occupied Ubong Cave as command post supply food and arms to guerillas.\n\nAfter Liberation, Hinoba-an was rehabilitated by some of its pioneering residents. More settlements were established, schools were built, trails developed for the people's convenience in going to places and in transporting their local produce to nearby towns and villages. There was also a huge influx of Cebuano-speaking people during this time.\n\nHinoban-ons predominantly speaks Cebuano and Ilonggo, and are used interchangeably everyday, making Hinoba-an one of the few bilingual municipalities in Negros Occidental (the other bilingual areas in Negros Occidental are Sipalay City, Kabankalan City, San Carlos City and Calatrava). Tagalog and English are also understood to some extent.\n\nHinoba-an is politically subdivided into 13 barangays, two of which comprise the town proper (or poblacion):\n\nSalvacion Cave along the vicinity of pebbled beaches of Barangay Talacagay has a natural covered pools ideal for bathing.\n\nUbong Cave is where the late Col. Jesús A. Villamor, hero of World War II landed bringing firearms for the Philippine guerillas aboard the US Navy Submarine in 1942, establishing the first radio contact with General Douglas MacArthur based in Australia at that time.\n\n\n"}

In the mid-11th century, the book passed to Gertrude, wife of Iziaslav of Kiev. She included her prayer book as part of the codex and commissioned its illuminations, which curiously blend Byzantine and Romanesque traditions.\n\nIn the 12th century, the codex was in the possession of the Andechs-Merania family, and was given to Elizabeth of Hungary either by her mother, Gertrude of Merania, or by her aunt, Saint Hedwig of Andechs. According to a 16th-century note on folio 8r, Saint Elizabeth gave the codex to the cathedral of Cividale in 1229.\n\nThe book features a large picture of Apostle Peter venerated by Gertrude and her son Yaropolk, whose Christian name was Peter. It is known that Yaropolk was the first to build a church to St Peter in Kiev and that he placed an image of that saint on his coins. In 1075 he was sent by his dethroned father to Rome in order to secure the Pope's support in recompense for bringing Russ (Ruth) under the patronage of St Peter (\"patrocinium beati Petri\").

In terms of land area, Kabankalan City is the largest city in the province of Negros Occidental and is the second largest city in the entire Negros Island next to Bayawan City with a total area of 697.35 km\n\nThe city hosts three major festivals: the \"Kabankalan Sinulog\" every third Sunday of January (celebrated together with Cebu City), \"Udyakan sa Kabankalan\" and the \"Charter Anniversary\". Kabankalan is also known for its \"Mag-aso Falls\" and the \"Balicaocao Resort\". Also located in the city is the main campus of the Central Philippines State University (CPSU).\n\nKabankalan City won the major award as the \"Best Performing City\" in Region VI in the 2011 Regional Search for Excellence in Local Governance (EXCEL). The award was given during the Pagdayaw 2011 program held at the Iloilo Grand Hotel in December 2011.\n\nAccording to historians, the first inhabitants of Kabankalan were people who came from neighboring towns. They derived the name Kabankalan from the word “Bangkal”, a species of a tree that is abundant in the place. The settlers established the Barangay form of government, with which every group has its own leader, called the Capitan.\n\nIn early years, Kabankalan started as a barrio of Ilog, a neighboring town of the city today. When Kabankalan turned into a town in 1903, its first town president was Capitan Lorenzo Zayco. But in mid-1907, a group of rebels called ″Pulahanes” led by Papa Isio, raided the town and burned down all the houses. However, the people of Kabankalan quickly recovered and rebuilt the town from the destruction caused by the dissidents.\n\nDuring the Spanish regime, Spaniards taught the people the Spanish language and introduced to them the Roman Catholic religion. When the Americans came, they introduced the democratic form of government. During this time, a lot of improvements came to the town and new modern techniques of farming were introduced by the Americans to the local farmers that improved their products.\n\nAfter the American regime, the Japanese occupied the town of Kabankalan. During this time, a recognized guerrilla unit and the local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military were formed to oppose the foreign aggression and many people fled to the mountains to avoid the Japanese military abuse. When the Americans returned to the island to aid Filipino soldiers under the Commonwealth Army and Constabulary and the recognized guerrillas, they helped the people be freed from the Japanese occupation.\n\nAfter the second World War, the town progressed and started to regain its economy. The establishment of two sugar mills in the 1960s and early 1970s gave the town a boost into the list of the top improving towns of Negros.\n\nThe town of Kabankalan was declared by then President Fidel V. Ramos as a chartered city on August 2, 1997, under Republic Act No. 8297.\n\nKabankalan occupies the central portion of the Southern Negros Island and its geographically located at 10° north and 122° east. It is bounded on the north by the City of Himamaylan, on the northwest by Panay Gulf, on the southwest by the Municipality of Ilog and on the southeast by the Province of Negros Oriental. It is 90 kilometers away from Bacolod City and 100 kilometers from Dumaguete City and the southern most town of Hinoba-an. With an area of 697.95 square kilometers, it is the largest city in Negros Occidental and the second largest in the whole Negros Island, after Bayawan City (which has an area of 699.08 square kilometers).\n\nKabankalan is over an hour's drive south of Bacolod City by private car while public utility vehicles reach the place in about two hours. The city, which serves as the hub of economic activities in southern Negros, is also the take-off point for various destinations down south, and links the province to Dumaguete City, capital of Negros Oriental, via the Kabankalan-Mabinay Highway. Its location roughly halfway between Bacolod and Dumaguete made it to supposedly host the regional center of the then Negros Island Region, along with neighbouring Mabinay to its southeast in Negros Oriental. Once completed, the Kabankalan City Domestic Airport will be the second active airport in the province (after the Bacolod-Silay International Airport).\n\nKabankalan has Type 3 climate condition which means dry season is from December to May while the rainy season is from June to November.

Due to its geographical area of usage, the \"Karol-an language\" is classified as a vulnerable language, making its conservation a top priority, as it is vital to the culture and arts of Kabankalan natives.\n\nKabankalan City, along with the cities of Sipalay and San Carlos and the municipalities of Hinoba-an and Calatrava, are the only places in Negros Occidental who are bilingual speakers, as the people in those areas can speak and understand both Cebuano (Bisaya) and Hiligaynon (Ilonggo) at the same time, due to the influx of Cebuano-speaking settlers in those areas.\n\n"}
{"id": "2051304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051304", "title": "La Carlota, Negros Occidental", "text": "La Carlota, Negros Occidental\n\n', (Hiligaynon: \"Dakbanwa sang La Carlota;\" Cebuano: \"Dakbayan sa La Carlota;\" Filipino: \"Lungsod ng La Carlota;\" Spanish: \"Ciudad de La Carlota\") officially the ', or simply referred to as City, is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people making it the least populous city in the province. \n\nUntil two years after its foundation in 1871, it was known as Simancas, a barrio under the jurisdiction of the neighboring town of San Enrique, which was led by a Spaniard who was married to a woman named Carlota. Legend has it that she was well-loved by the natives for her social works so that they named their settlement after her when it was created as a municipality near the end of the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines. In line with the Spanish practice of adding an article before a proper noun, “La Carlota” became its official name. On June 19, 1965, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4585, La Carlota was granted a city charter, becoming one of the two landlocked cities in Negros Island, the other being neighbouring Canlaon City in Negros Oriental.\n\nIn 2011, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) awarded the city with a \"seal of good housekeeping\" for its efforts in advancing accountability and transparency in local governance. In the same year, it was also named as one of the top-performing local government units in the Philippines, ranking eighth in the component cities category. On December 29, 2011, the city was nominated for excellence in local governance, an honor given by the provincial government under its Pagpasidungog Awards .\n\nThroughout much of its early history, agriculture was the main source of livelihood for the native settlers of Simancas. The original inhabitants grew rice for their own consumption and latter ones cultivated tobacco for export during the Spanish colonial era. Early settlers were drawn to Candaguit River from where Simancas expanded. In 1856 historians began mentioning the village of Mampunay in their accounts of the settlement's history. The local parish priest of San Enrique at the time designated Simancas as a barrio.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines in 1565, Simancas was led by Mangkas, a negrito warrior. He lived around the area of what is today known as Canman-ug Creek. People looked up to him for his bravery in warding off hostile forces and for keeping the peace. Legend says that because the people revered him, they named their children after him. With many inhabitants named Mangkas, the settlement eventually became known as Simancas. \n\nThe Spanish began establishing their administration over the Philippine archipelago since the late 16th century. \n\nIn 1856, the barrio of Simancas was placed under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Valladolid. On July 23, 1864, however, the settlements of San Enrique, Pontevedra and Simancas were formed into a new municipality known as San Enrique. On October 15, 1869, the King of Spain issued a royal decree elevating Pontevedra into a parish and Simancas into a town. In 1871, King Carlos of Spain issued another royal decree changing the name of Simancas to La Carlota \n\nThe decree was issued upon the request of Spanish \"Carlistas\", or the followers of King Carlos of Spain. On December 4, 1876, a royal order was issued making La Carlota a parish.\n\nBy the 1890s, La Carlota's agricultural advances had become a model for farms throughout Negros. During this period, the sugar planters of La Carlota formed \"Circulo de Agricultores\", the first organization on the island to undertake an anti-locust campaign. When the Philippine revolution broke out in 1898, the planters actively participated in the fight for independence from Spain.\n\nThe 1890s were important years in the history not only of La Carlota but of the whole island. It was during this decade when the \"levantamiento\" or uprising against Spain started and ended with the capitulation of the Spanish authorities in Bacolod, the capital of the province, to the revolutionary forces in 1898. The division of Negros island into two distinct provinces (Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental) took place in 1890 at the start of this historic decade. La Carlota as well saw a flowering of culture during this decade, which ushered in what many consider as its golden literary age. Near the end of that decade was born in La Carlota one of its most famous children in the literary field: Adelina Gurrea. She later gained world prominence as a journalist, poet and novelist in Spain where she espoused women's causes in her writings.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1906, La Carlota figured prominently in the anti-American resistance movement on Negros. It produced some of the best-known \"Babaylan\" leaders, chief among whom was Papa Isio. He led the struggle against the American occupation that replaced the Spanish regime as a result of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War and ceded control of the Philippines to the United States. \"Babaylans \" or \"entrencirados \" conducted guerrilla warfare against the American forces in the towns of La Carlota, Isabela, Kabankalan and La Castellana. \nThe American period saw the construction of a Gabaldon-type school building in 1908. The Central Azucarera de La Carlota, considered as the biggest sugar mill tandem in Asia, was constructed by the Elizalde family in 1918.\n\nThe period from 1918 through the 1980s saw further expansion in La Carlota in terms of infrastructure. The Presidencia Building, the seat of the local government, was constructed in 1934, and since then has become a landmark in the city center. In 1948 the La Carlota City High School building was constructed. Two years later, it hosted the first-ever carnival to be held on the island. La Carlota has produced three world boxing champions: Pancho Villa, world flyweight champion from 1923 to 1925; Small Montana, world flyweight crown holder from 1935 to 1938; and Little Dado (Eleuterio Zapanta), world bantamweight champion in 1940 and world flyweight champion in 1941.\n\nThe creation of La Carlota as a chartered city occurred on June 19, 1965 by virtue of Republic Act No. 4585. In 1967, La Carlota City College was established, becoming the only community college in the province at that point in time to be operated by a local government unit. From its humble beginnings as a small settlement, La Carlota has evolved into one of the major sugar-producing cities in the Philippines.\n\nLa Carlota City is geographically located at the north-central portion of Negros Occidental. It is bordered in the north by Bago City, in the east by Kanlaon Volcano and Canlaon City of Negros Oriental, in the southeast by the town of La Castellana, in the southwest by Pontevedra and in the west by San Enrique. It has a total land area of , most of it devoted to agriculture.\n\nThe city enjoys two distinct seasons like the rest of the Philippines: The dry season from January through May and the wet season from June through December.\n\nLa Carlota City is politically subdivided into 14 barangays (villages), three urban and eleven rural areas. The urban barangays are Barangay I, Barangay II and Barangay III, which are all situated in the city proper. The farthest from the city is Barangay Yubo, which is 17.9 kilometers from the urban core. The city's barangays are as follows:\n\nThe first recorded census, conducted in 1903, pegged the population at 3,097. The 1995 Philippine Statistics Authority survey recorded a population of 56,414. Two years later, the population grew to 57,982, increasing to 62,094 in 2002. By then population density was 4.5 persons per hectare. Of the 14 barangays or villages, Barangay II has the biggest population with 9,221 and Barangay Yubo has the smallest with 1,962.\n\nAbout 96% of the people use a local Negrense variant of Hiligaynon as their main language of communication, while the remaining 04% of the population use Cebuano. English, and sometimes Filipino, are generally understood and spoken by a large segment of the city's population, especially amongst the well-educated peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After recovering from initial shock, the Japanese infantry began pouring in from every direction of the barangay.\n\nIn 1951, the barrios of Magallon, Odiong and Guinpanaan, then belonging to the town of Isabela, were separated to form the town of Magallon. The boundary between the two towns were as surveyed by the Bureau of lands in accordance with Resolution No. 1. of the joint session of the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental and the Municipal Council of Isabela dated November 15, 1949, and subsequently concurred to by Resolution No. 79 of the Municipal Council of Isabela dated December 26, 1949.\n\nIn 1957, the town was renamed to Moises Padilla, a public figure who was tortured and killed for political reasons by assassins of former Governor Rafael Lacson in Negros Island.

{"id": "2051318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051318", "title": "Bramber", "text": "Bramber\n\nBramber is a former manor, village and civil parish in the Horsham District of West Sussex, England. It has a ruined mediaeval castle which was the \"caput\" of a large feudal barony. Bramber is located on the northern edge of the South Downs and on the west side of the River Adur. Nearby are the communities of Steyning to the west and Upper Beeding to the east, and the other side of the river. The closest historical connection, however, is with the village of Botolphs to the south.\n\nThe ecclesiastical parishes of Bramber and Botolphs were united possibly as early as 1526, but certainly by 1534 with the priest living at Botolphs. Later the priest's official residence became the imposing Bramber mansion and landmark now called \"Burletts\" and located on Clays Hill. The union of the civil parish councils followed 400 years later in 1933.\n\nBramber was the \"caput\" of a large feudal barony held from the 11th to 14th centuries by the Braose family which was noted for its impact on the medieval history of the southern Welsh Marches. On a small hill stand the remains of Bramber Castle, a Norman castle built by the family.\n\nBramber Parish Church of St Nicholas was originally built as the castle chapel and is the only part of the castle site not in ruins. The church attracts large numbers of tourists, and is the oldest post-Conquest Norman church in Sussex. Bramber Castle originally protected the Rape of Bramber, the historic sub-division of the county of Sussex.\n\nThe feudal barons of Bramber were as follows:\n\nAfter this time the honour of Bramber was held by the Dukes of Norfolk.\n\nAnother historic building in Bramber is St Mary's House, a late 15th-century timber-framed house on a site associated with the Knights Templar. The present building was constructed in about 1470 by William of Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester and founder of Magdalen College, Oxford. The house has beautiful gardens with topiary figures, and a quite large secret garden at the back. The house is open to the public in season, and there is a tearoom in the grounds. The house has a music room which has two 14th-century ornately carved stone chantry tombs serving as fireplaces, and is regularly used for concerts and recitals.\n\nOriginally it was a monastic hostel for pilgrims and monks who collected the tolls at Bramber bridge, a bridge over the River Adur, incorporating a Chapel dedicated to St Mary the Virgin on its central span, though now reduced to a flat bridge of just a few feet over a tributary of the river, following silting, and a change of course. This should not be confused with the nearby Beeding Bridge, a hump-back bridge which now spans the main course of the river. King Charles II is claimed to have stayed at St Mary's House during his escape to France after defeat at the Battle of Worcester.\n\nThe Monarch's Way long-distance footpath, following Charles' supposed route to Shoreham-by-Sea, crosses the Adur at Bramber. The house has been used in a number of television productions including an episode of \"Doctor Who\" where the TARDIS landed inside. Its owners since 1984 are Peter Thorogood and Roger Linton.\n\nJust outside Bramber, in the direction of Botolphs village, formerly stood a medieval hospital and nunnery, caring for sufferers of leprosy, and dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene. Although long since closed, this part of Bramber is still known as the \"Maudlin District\", spelt following a phonetic pronunciation of the saint's name. Maudlyn House stands on the site of the hospital, and nearby roads include Maudlin Lane, Maudlyn Park, Maudlyn Parkway, and Maudlyn Close.\n\nHistorically, Bramber returned two members (MPs) to the unreformed House of Commons. Amongst the most famous politicians to serve as Member for Bramber was William Wilberforce, the anti-slavery campaigner, and independent Tory politician.\n\nTaxidermist Walter Potter was a native of Bramber, and is buried in its churchyard. His museum of taxidermist's tableaux was once much visited. The museum building still stands, part having been incorporated into an Indian restaurant, and part having become garages for houses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2051322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051322", "title": "Sagay, Negros Occidental", "text": "Sagay, Negros Occidental\n\n', officially the ', or simply referred to as City, is a 2nd class in the Philippines, in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSagay can be identified in the map of Negros Occidental because of its \"ice-cream cone\" shape sliced from the northern tip of Negros. It is bounded in the north by Asuncion Pass and the Visayan Sea; the City of Talisay and Municipality of Calatrava in the south; cities of Cadiz and Silay in the west and the City of Escalante and Municipality of Toboso in the east.\n\nThe name of the city comes from the semi-spherical shell called \"sigay\", which can be found in the area.\n\nSagay City was originally called Arguelles Nicolai when Teniente Francisco Rodriguez and Basilio Cordova founded it in 1860 in the mouth of the Bulanon River. Later, by the order of the Spanish governor the town was transferred to Pueblo de Magallanes (now known as Old Sagay) in honor of Fernando Magallanes.\n\nHaving the status of a pueblo, Sagay was entitled to have a \"Capitan del Pueblo,\" the highest town official during the time. The first to be appointed to this position by the Spanish Governor was Elulalio Rodriguez. Gregorio Parreño, and Peter Parker later succeeded him.\n\nDuring the Philippine Revolution, Sagay contributed its share to what proved to be a successful national struggle for independence. The hard-won First Philippine Republic was however short-lived when the country passed to the hands of another colonial power, the United States of America in 1898.\n\nIn 1906, during the administration of the second President Benjie Adolfo, the name of the town was officially changed to Sagay. The name was taken from the semi-spherical shell called \"sigay\", which can be found in the area. The American influence seeped into every aspect of Sagay's life, politically and culturally. At this period of Sagay's history, land transportation began to supplant sea travel, but the seaside community continued to flourish. The first public schools conducted in English were established. Mr. Cornelio Pascual, Sr. was the first English Teacher assigned in Vito. American missionaries were sent to tutor more Filipino English teachers.\n\nMeanwhile, sometime in 1907, the Insular Lumber Company, reputed to be the biggest hardwood lumber mill in the world, was established in what is now called Barangay Fabrica. Though measures to prevent the destruction of Sagay's rich forest were made, reforestation programs failed. Later, the old forest areas were converted mostly into sugarcane fields and some into cornfields. With the exhaustion of the forest resources of Sagay, the ILCO – Philippines was phased out in 1975 and later transferred to Hinoba-an.\n\nA major industrial development gave Sagay another big step forward: the establishment of Lopez Sugar Corporation in the 1920s. Also during these years, sugar, copra, lumber and fishing became the important source of income for the inhabitants. The economic growth of Sagay brought about influx of migrants from Iloilo, Guimaras, Cebu and Bohol. This trend made Sagay a melting pot of ethnically-different but equally-hardworking Cebuanos and Ilonggos. With these developments, business and industry flourished. Leading both sectors were big businessmen and industrialists like the Lopezes, the Cuaycongs, the Jisons, the Gamboas, and the Vasquezes. The sugar boom brought the \"old families\" into the industry like the Pueys, the Nichols, the Katalbases, and the Tupases, which branched out to the Marañons, the de la Pazes, the Ibrados and the Libo-ons.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, two Civil Governments existed in Sagay. Under the Japanese national government of Jose Laurel, Sr., Vicente Katalbas was appointed mayor, while the resistance government of the province, headed by Alfredo Montelibano, Sr. as governor, appointed Tomas Londres as Mayor whose seat of government was in the mountain areas of Sitio Balibag, Lopez Jaena. Their term however, abruptly ended when the combined Filipino and American forces liberated the province from the Japanese at the early part of 1945. When Sergio Osmeña, Sr., as vice-president to Manuel L. Quezon who died during the war, took over the helm of the national government, Teodoro Lopez, Sr. was appointed Mayor of Sagay. During his short term, Teodoro Lopez, Sr. concentrated in rebuilding the administrative machinery of the local government.\n\nSeveral hundreds of thousands of Filipino soldiers and officers of the 7th, 72nd and 75th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated and re-occupied the town of Sagay by attacking and driving off Japanese troops in 1945.\n\nThe factories were destroyed and the economy was in shambles. A Eusebio Lopez Memorial School Building in Barangay Paraiso served as the incarceration area for captured Filipino soldiers and American pilots and soldiers. It also served as the headquarters of Fourth Flight Division of the Japanese Imperial Air Force whose airfield was located in Pula-Bunglas area in Barangay Malubon. During the last days of the war, the Fourth Flight Division of the Japanese Imperial Airforce organized kamikaze or suicide units to be stationed here and in Bacolod. Known later as the Third Regiment Suicide Corps, it was headed by Major Tsuneharu Sirai with Capt. Tetsuzu Kimura as his Chief Staff Officer. Of its 59 pilots and crews, 30 were killed in the Battle of Leyte Gulf which they played a major role as kamikaze pilots. The Pula – Bunglas area of Barangay Malubon served as the Japanese landing field for the Fourth Flight Division. It was also a site where the local soldiers, guerrillas and civilians, after Japanese spies identified them as guerrilla members or collaborators, were forced to dig holes and consequently executed and buried. Old residents believe that almost 1,542 people were buried here.\n\nBarrio 3 Wharf, Fabrica served as the transport point of processed lumber destined to Japan from Insular Lumber Company and also a docking area of Japanese supply ship during the war-torn years. The Iglanggam Bridge at Barangay Tadlong served as the dumping site of executed local soldiers, guerrillas and civilians. This is also known as the site where confiscated money, especially silver Peso coins encased in concrete blocks, were dumped by the retreating Japanese soldiers.\n\nBalibag Hill, Lopez Jaena was the place where the set of resistance government of Free Sagay under Mayor Tomas Londres (appointed by Island Governor Alfredo Montelibano, Sr.) was established. It was also known as tabo-an or market place during the war and in 1944, a group of Japanese soldiers killed about 27 homeguards or \"toltog\" guerrillas. After the mass killing, the Japanese soldiers set the whole area on fire, burning the shanties and the dead. The Japanese \"puppet\" government under Vicente Lacson Katalbas was established at the Big House, Central Lopez, Paraiso. A Japanese barracks and checkpoint was established. A Japanese anti-aircraft still can be found inside the ground of the house.\n\nAt Barangay Poblacion II, Japanese zero fighters left bullet holes when they intended to destroy the water supply of the people during the last days of the war. Holes from 60mm machine-guns left an indelible mark on the water tank.\n\nA training site of USAFFE (United States Army Forces in the Far East), under the supervision of Lt. Dominador Gaerland, was established at Tangnonon, Barangay Fabrica at the ancestral home of Lopez Kabayao.\n\nOn July 26, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States of America ordered a national mobilization in the Philippines and on August 23, 1942, the first group of reservist in Negros were called on duty by virtue of Philippine Army HQ order of August 4 and they were trained here. The first group reported in the said mobilization camp constituted the 71st Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe first election held right after the Second World War made Jose B. Puey, Sr. and Amalio Cueva, Sr. Mayor and Vice Mayor respectively. However, shortly after, Mayor Jose B. Puey, Sr. was appointed member of the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental thus Vice Mayor Amalio Cueva, Sr. took over the Municipal leadership and through his initiative, the seat of government was transferred to its present site, Dalusan. Incidentally, the transfer signaled the diminishing importance of sea travel and the takeover of overland transportation as the conveyor of progress and development. Old Sagay (the previous seat of government) is an old coastal center of population while Dalusan is a late highway occurrence. The transfer was made possible partly through land donations for the town site by Doña Rosario Cooper and the heirs of the late Clayton Nichols. Schools, markets and commercial establishments were soon established. Jose B. Puey, Sr. remained Provincial Board Member until his election as congressman for the first District of Negros Occidental in 1953.\n\nIn the late 1950s, two Sagaynon politicians were in the forefront of Negros politics, Jose B. Puey, Sr. (Congressman from 1953 to 1957) and Alfredo E. Marañon, Sr. (Board Member from 1956 to 1959). This meant that provincial and national aid were extended to Sagay. More roads and school buildings were constructed, thousands of hectares of logged off area of the Insular Lumber Company were planted with coconut trees and sugarcane. Sherman Hill, near Barangay Bato was discovered to contain rich deposits of the highest silica. The growing markets for sea products brought about unprecedented boom in the fishing industry for which the coastal waters of Sagay proved to equal the demand. The municipal population rose to more than 60,000 and the revenue increased. After Mayor Amalio Cueva, came Tereso Canoy, Bruno Cueva, Sr. and Quintin Katalbas.\n\nIn 1963, Jose H. Puey, Jr. was elected mayor of Sagay. The income continued to rise. More schools were built and more roads, linking the barangays to the town capital, were constructed. The inefficient electrical system was updated, fire fighting equipment and the police units were modernized. It was during this time that Alfredo Marañon Sr. began entertaining the idea of putting up another sugar mill in Sagay which farmers can partly own. He campaigned for support, but there was too much opposition even from some of his close friends. Nevertheless, his idea became a reality when in 1967, shortly after his death, Sagay Central Inc. was born. Mr. Marañon's dream was made real through the help of President Ferdinand E. Marcos and the then Philippine National Bank President Roberto S. Benedicto who both shared his vision for Sagay. With the new sugar mill at Barangay Bato, new areas were opened and planted with sugarcane. Today the new sugar mill factory is benefiting hundreds of small farmers.\n\nThe then Mayor, Congressman and now Governor of Negros Occidental Alfredo G. Marañon, Jr. assumed the political leadership of Sagay in 1972. Under his administration, Sagay acquired a new town hall, a municipal gymnasium, a livestock auction market, public markets for a number of barangays and municipal wharves in barangays Vito and Old Sagay. He caused the organization of Sagay Water District in 1978. He effected the purchase of a municipal subdivision for the municipal employees in 1979. These achievements by themselves have helped make Sagay a first-class C municipality (the highest in the entire Negros). The then Mayor Alfredo G. Marañon, Jr.'s successful negotiation of the sponsorship contract with the German District of Osterholz is his most important achievement.\n\nIt had been a long time aspiration to get Sagay city status. The leadership of Mayor Joseph G. Marañon and Vice Mayor Fortunato S. Javelosa inspired the authorship of Congressman Alfredo G. Marañon of House Bill No. 6543, \"An Act Converting the Municipality of Sagay into a component city of Negros Occidental\" during the 10th Congress. Passing through the legislation process, a public hearing was held in Sagay City on February 22, 1996. On May 3, 1996, Sen. Raul Roco sponsored the Senate Bill No. 1191, the Senate version of the cityhood. On June 11, 1996, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed into law RA8192, now the charter of Sagay City. On June 10, 1996, the residents voted and ratified RA8192 and made Sagay, officially Sagay City.\n\nSagay City is politically subdivided into 25 Barangay.\n\nAndres Bonifacio became a barrio in the late 60s; once called Sitio Maasin. It was the largest sitio of Barrio Vito and contributed a huge income because of its lime quarries and vast land area. The separation of Andres Bonifacio from Vito was materialized through land donation of the barrio and school sites by the family of the late Carlos and Elea Canoy-Esperancilla. It was Mrs. Elea Canoy Esperancilla who suggested to name the new barrio Andres Bonifacio to give honor to the great Filipino hero. Today, Andres Bonifacio is a fast moving barangay when it comes to development and progress. It is also noted for its natural and man-made caves\nSometime in 1929, Bato, then a forestall land with few inhabitants was a place of gathering of people living in the hinterlands. There used to be a place called “tabu”, where people from the hinterlands meet for recreation like cockfighting (“tari”) or horse fighting in a clearing area near the Himoga-an River where a big rock (“bato”) was a landmark. The place was also used by the people during “tabu”, a day set by them for marketing or bartering their products. For the few residents of the place, this clearing also served as a place of recreation. For people who visited the place for recreation or for economic reasons, they named the place Bato because of the big rock.\nThe place Baviera was once covered with thick forest where wild pigs and other wild animals abound in this area. It is located in the southwestern part at the foot of Shermanhill. Before the Second World War, tall big trees were cut down by workers of the Insular Lumber Co. for it was under the concession with the Philippine Government. After leaving the area, sometime in 1932, a businessman by the name of FaustoBaviera cleared the area by making kaingins and planted the place with root crops, rice, cassava and others. Being a businessman he likewise gathered products like rattan, hagnaya and balao and sold these products in BrgyParaiso, a progressive barangay of Sagay.\nDuring the pre-Spanish time, unnamed village was inhabited by various non-Christian tribes who were independent of and hostile towards each other. The known history of Barangay Bulanon started sometime in the year 1880 when the Spanish conquestadores first founded a settlement of non-Christian Filipinos near the twin big rivers. The village was originally named Arguelles after father Arguelles, the founder of the said settlement. The place later became the first pueblo.\nBarangay Cpo. Himoga-an got its name from the visayan word “campo” which means “Camp” of the Insular Lumber Co. (ILCO) personnel, where housing, a canteen, bodega and locomotive water tank were constructed while Himoga-an was taken from the name of the river traversing the place was located. Literally, Cpo. Himoga-an is a camp of laborer residents. In 1935, after the camp was completed, a civic- minded citizen named Simeon Templado, convinced all parents in the camp to have a school for their children, and a school building was constructed by way of self-help cooperation. Later, they organized the Parent-Teacher Association in which Mr. Templado became president. With his leadership, the PTA passed a resolution requesting the local government of Sagay to release a donation of four (4) hectares of land for the school site and public plaza. The resolution was indorsed by the local government of Sagay to the Bureau of Land which later approved the proposal and survey was then conducted. Upon completion of the survey, another PTA resolution was passed requesting for the declaration of Cpo. Himoga-an as one of the barrios of Sagay. After several months, the Municipality of Sagay approved the proposal and declared Cpo. Himoga-an as a new barrio of Sagay.\nIn the year 1957, Rt. Rv. Dr. Roberto G. Mahilum, who was called Master and Father and Founder of a Trinitian Religious Organization, legally known as the ALAPH DIVINE TEMPLE, duly established and organized in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, teaching the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, ventured himself together with a group of his adherents and settled in the vicinity of Barangay Cpo. Santiago which they called Colonia Divina. On May 2, 1963 through Mun. Res. #59 of the Municipal Council of Sagay, petitioned the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental to declare Colonia Divina as Chartered Barrio. Then, on July 19, 1963 Colonia Divina became a Chartered Barrio as per Resolution #614 of the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental.\nThe name FABRICA refers to lumber factory or sawmill. It was told, that when a group of visiting Americans/ Europeans asked about the place the local residents just answered “Pabrica” referring to the mill itself (not knowing exactly what was being asked). However, with their American accent instead of Pabrica they pronounced it “FABRICA” since then the place bears that name.\nThe recorded history of Barangay General Luna started in 1929, when the Insular Lumber Company began its logging operation in the area. The inhabitants followed to clear the area and began cultivating the land with rice and corn. The families with big clearings are the Duncaras and the Piccios. They donated portion of their cleared land to the government for the barrio and the school site, Later they named the new barangay after General Luna, one of our great Filipino heroes.\nBarangay Lopez Jaena is located in the eastern part of the City of Sagay, Negros Occidental. The history of the barangay dates back in 1902, which started as a very small settlement. Missionaries from foreign lands came and found out that this place was scarcely populated. The place was covered with big trees or forest. Among the first residents was Pedro Paculba and was considered as the most respected person in this place. He named this place “Lopez Jaena” in honor of Graciano Lopez Jaena, an Ilonggo hero who was recognized for his great contribution to the history of our country. The Missionaries brought about changes especially in the educational and religious aspect in the life of the people. At that time the head of the people was called “ Cabeza del Barrio “. Education had given them opportunities in finding means to improve their ways of living. School was established and the first teachers were mostly Missionaries. All of the leaders have contributed their part in transforming this place into a big settlement. There was intermingling of dialects. Many have established permanent dwellings in this place. This barangay was also awarded the cleanest barrio in Sagay, under the leadership of the late Mr. Felix Rodillado, who at that time was the Barrio Lieutenant or Teniente del Barrio.\nThe term “Malubon” is an ethnic Negrito term which connotes a white plain area suited to rice farming. As part and parcel of the lumber concession of the defunct Insular Lumber Company (ILCO), Malubon was a heavily forested area. After the rapid cutting of the forest trees, ILCO moved to the upland areas which are still forested leaving Malubon as agricultural area which has become very attractive for settlers and homesteaders. Sometime in the years 1939–40, Malubon was officially organized as a distinct barrio separated from Fabrica. School was opened to accommodate the educational needs of its children.\nMany years ago, there was a small settlement located in the rolling hills of the Municipality of Sagay. The place was covered with thick vegetation and trees and people come to visit the place and later decided to dwell. These people who first migrated called the place SAPLAD. Later on, through the efforts of a civic-spirited group, a school was built which encouraged more people to settle and owned lands. One of the first settlers was Crispin Maquiling, member of the Philippine Constabulary and who later became the barrio lieutenant. His leadership was looked upon by the people, being their good leader that they decided to name the place Maquiling in his honor. Today, the place continues to flourish as Sagay progresses to become a fully developed city in Negros Occidental.\nSometime in the year 1880, the first known settlers in the island were the Abong brothers led by Eusebio Abong popularly known as Kapitan Sebio. They were grown fishermen from Sicogon Island, Carles Iloilo. At that time, the whole island had no name to call on. Kapitan Sebio together with his brothers Francisco and Atong cleared the island and utilized the area as pasture of their herbs. They divided area among themselves the island for them to settle and the most frequent place for gathering is the place of Atong which they called it Cangatong, a Cebuano word which means “it's Atong's place.” Cangatong is a place where a big Mocaboc tree grows that most transient fishermen usually took their siesta time. The said Mocaboc tree is a kind of mangrove that was very famous at that time as medicinal tree. Then, it was Francisco who suggested to name the island Mocaboc after the tree considering the abundance of the species in the island. However, the Spanish authorities cannot\npronounce Mocaboc properly so they inserted the syllable “lo” making it Molocaboc. From that time on, the place bore the name Molocaboc and is now noted for various species of mangroves lining its coast and of bubble shell deposit\nThe recorded history of Sagay dates back to the 1860 era when Teniente Francisco Rodriguez and Basilio Cordova founded a small settlement in the mouth of a river known as BulanonRiver. The settlement was then called Arguelles. In due time the settlement prospered and became the town proper. Arguelles was the center of commerce and trade in the area for about ten years from the time of its founding. In 1870, the Spanish Governor ordered the transfer of the town site to a bigger and more progressive community, also near the sea. The place was christened “Pueblo de Magallanes, the present site of Barangay Old Sagay. After World War II, the seat of government was transferred to the present Poblacion site, Dalusan but the barangay retained its name as Sagay with the prefix old referring to the old settlement in the coastal area\n\nSagay City's inhabitants are known to speak a mixture of Hiligaynon and Cebuano.\n\nThe elected mayor in 2007 Elections is Alfredo Marañon Jr. with his vice mayor elect Leo Rafael Cueva. In 2012 election, Leo Rafael Cueva elected as Mayor with his vice mayor Kent Javelosa. The Mayor is Alfredo D. Marañon, III son of the Governor Marañon, Jr with Vice – Mayor Narciso L.

It consolidated all the remote barangays of San Carlos City and the towns of Calatrava and Murcia which were apparently neglected due to inaccessibility. The town is named after the former Vice Governor Salvador V.

Due to its high altitude like Baguio City, the town can support crops that grow in temperate areas, making it ideal for a multitude of farming businesses. Tourism is on the rise for the town especially when travellers head out into the heart of the province. Also located in the municipality are the Choco Hills, similar to Bohol's Chocolate Hills.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality's status was elevated into a city on July 1, 1960, per Republic Act No. 2643, approved on June 18, 1960, and Presidential Proclamation No. 685 s. 1960.\n\nSan Carlos City was formerly named \"Nabingkalan\", deriving its name from \"Nabingka\", a beautiful daughter of a chieftain of the Negrito settlement in the area, who ruled the barrio during the early part in the 17th century. She was famous for her loveliness and mental and physical prowess. After her death, the people mourned for two years, and to perpetuate her memory, named the barrio Nabingkalan. The settlement was later bought by Carlos Apurado from Badian, Cebu, who, with the help of fellow pioneers, developed the settlement into a thriving Christian village. Fragments of written history show that in 1856, the Island of Buglas (Negros), as a politico-military province under Spain, was divided into two provinces, West Negros under Iloilo and East Negros under Cebu. The barrio of Nabingkalan under Calatrava, was under the jurisdiction of Iloilo. Señor Don Emilio Saravia, the first political-military governor in the island during the Spanish era, renamed the place and established it as a \"pueblo\".\n\nWhen this mission was created in 1895, it belonged to the municipality of Calatraba, although it is true, that since 1891 a Religious was destined for it.The state of those years gives us the very small number of inhabitants that comprised it, which is that of 1,100 souls, who rather inhabited the mountainous p art than that of the p lay a, where the current village is. Fr. Pedro Chivite was assigned to the service of that mission. Vacant this mission during the Revolution, for the year 1904 Father Eusebio Valderrama took care of it. This with the help of the PP. Ángel Quintana, Juan Lorenzo and Vicente Vázquez attended to all the towns of that coast, from Guinjulngan to Escalante. Since that date, it is still administered by our Fathers. But in what was a bad, poor and depopulated village in 97, today it is one of the most important towns in the rich Province of Negros Occidental. of San Carlos today amounts, according to approximate calculation, to 30,000 souls. That extensive plot of land previously uncultivated today is painstakingly worked. A Spaniard who observed the fertility of that land began by raising a small sugarcane farm; and seeing the good results obtained, others were added, those fields were cultivated, modern machines were installed and, thus, what was once a wasteland, today is one of the most productive villages in Negros. In 1889 there were only four estates, in 1897 they amounted to 16 and today they are some more, property in their majority of Spanish art.\n\nThen in 1856 Negros was raised to the category of a politico-military province, Don Emilio Saravia being the first politico-military governor. It was during the governorship of Saravia that several towns of Occidental Negros, like San Isido, San Carlos,and Calatrava were established.\n\nSan Carlos prospered through the years, however, the village lost its \"pueblo\" category, and in 1890, when Negros Island was divided into Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental, San Carlos was recorded as an \"arrabal\" or barrio of Calatrava (Hilub-ang). \n\nDuring the first years of the American occupation of the Philippines, the economic and social pace of the activities of the people were gauged on the movements of the big landholders and Spaniards in the lowlands. In 1903, the political arena was a hot place, it being the first taste of the Filipinos to elect their own leaders. In 1912, when a sugar central was constructed, the economic life of the people was greatly enhanced. The political activities, however, was closely woven with that of Calatrava, until 1925, when Calatrava was organized into a municipality.\n\nSan Carlos Milling Company of San Carlos, Negros, have erected the first and only modern sugar mills in the Philippines, and they have gone into cane cultivation and sugar manufacture in a scientific way. The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons of cane per day, which means about 125 tons of centrifugal sugar. It was completed at the end of 1913 at a cost of about one million dollars, and the first cane ground was from the 1914 crop.\n\nIn 1920, Municipality of San Carlos comprised barrios Antabayan, Cubay, Euzcasa, Looc, Malalamban, San Juan, Santa Filomena, Sitio Banatic, Tigbon, Varconia.\n\nThe municipality of San Carlos shall consist of its present territory and that of the municipality of Calatrava, with the seat of the municipal government at the present municipality of San Carlos (Act No. 716, Enacted, April 2, 1903\n\nThe First World War encouraged the people of San Carlos to produce more sugar-producing crops. After the armistice in 1917, the planters who produced more sugar had their wealth greatly increased because of the new price of sugar never before enjoyed by the planters. During World War I, many sons of San Carlos volunteered to fight for the United States, but a few months later, were sent back home because of the armistice.\n\nSan Carlos was actively involved on the war efforts against Imperial Japan during The Second World War (World War II). A month after the surrender of Negros to the Japanese Imperial Forces, the Guerrilla Movement began in San Carlos and Calatrava. As early as June 15, 1942, Guerilla Units under the leadership of Capt. Eugenio Antonio,Jr., Lt. Leonardo Marane and Lt. Alfredo Valdivia assisted by the Philippine Commonwealth Military Troops began operations against the enemy. Pitched battles were fought within the environs of the \"poblacion\". Despite the presence of the U.S. forces under Maj. Edward McClenahan, separate Guerrilla Units were scattered in the area under different Commanders as they were not able to establish a formal chain-of-command among the different Guerilla Factions effectively.\n\nUpon the return of some local USAFFE officers to San Carlos, the guerrilla movement was formally organized into fighting units under USAFFE Capts. Catalino D. Rivera, Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Loreto Y. Apuhin, together with Lts. Florencio C. Yap and Andres L. Arrogante, the bands of roving guerrillas in San Carlos were consolidated under one command. Young men in their early teens (just barely enough to carry rifles) joined the ranks and fought bravely face-to-face against the Japanese.\n\nIn March 1945, the Philippine Commonwealth forces under the 7th, 71st and 72nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and local guerrilla units under the command of Col. Ernesto S. Mata, attacked the Japanese garrison in the compound of San Carlos Milling Company and succeeded in driving away the Japanese Army, at the cost of the life of Lt. Alfredo Valdivia.\n\nIn October 10, 1945, President Sergio Osmeña appointed Eugenio Antonio as Acting Mayor of San Carlos and Anacleto Facturan as Acting Vice Mayor.\n\nThe first post-war election found the town with a Liberal government. In 1953, the Nacionalista wrested the power from the Liberals.\n\nBy Virtue of Republic Act No. 2643, the Municipality of San Carlos was converted into the City of San Carlos on July 1, 1960. The city inherited from the municipality numerous improvements, introduced by the last municipal administration under Mayor Sofronio Carmona.\n\nLocated along the northeastern coast touching the Tañon Strait, San Carlos City is located at the crossroads of Bacolod and Dumaguete, the two major cities of the Negros Island Region. The city is also used as a departure point to Cebu City as well. It has a coastline, of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by the island of Refugio, also known as Sipaway. Due to these aspects, the Philippine Ports Authority has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two RO-RO vessels and the extension of the length of the port to .\n\nSan Carlos City has two pronounced seasons, wet and dry. The rainy season is from May to January with heavy rains occurring during the months of August and September. Dry season lasts from February to April. December and January are the coldest months while April is the hottest.\n\nSan Carlos City is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n\nCebuano is the major language of San Carlos City, closely followed by Hiligaynon (also known as Ilonggo). Both languages are understood and used in both, the urban and rural areas. English and to some extent Tagalog, are also spoken and understood, especially in the urban areas.\n\nLocated in the city is San Carlos Solar Energy, owner of the SaCaSol I solar installation located in the north of the city, currently the largest operational solar plant in the Philippines.\n\n\nFrom 1899 to the last days of the administration of the municipality of San Carlos, the following persons have served as \"presidentes\" and mayors:\n\n\n\n\nThe Pintaflores Festival was born out of the city's search for a cultural identity and tradition. In 1992 after successfully holding two activities with the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival and the Dances of Flowers as highlights of the city fiesta, the idea of blending the two concepts to come up with a presentation that could be considered the city's very own started what today is one of the most popular street dancing festivals in the region, the present-day \"Pintaflores Festival\".\n\n\"Pintaflores\" is coined from the words \"pintados\" (\"painted ones\"), the concept behind the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival, and \"flores\", the Spanish word for \"flowers\" that dominated the theme of the Dances of Flowers. The \"Pintaflores\" street dancing and ritual competition highlights the annual Pintaflores Festival every November 3–5.\n\nIt features rhythmic dances and dance dramas of life and death and the triumph of good against evil that depict the people's thanksgiving and merriment, abundant blessings and success. As part of the \"Pintados\" tradition, the faces, arms, bodies and legs of the dancers are painted with flowers to express gratitude to man and his environment.\n\nThe street dancing is culminated by a dance ritual performed at the City auditorium. Different dance steps and musical accompaniment add to the thrill of the competition. The human flower formation is another impressive part of the dance ritual which are products of the ingenuity and skill of the choreographers and dancers.\n\nColegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos high school students, bested seasoned contestants to land third place in the free interpretation category in the heavily competed Sinulog festival in Cebu City in January 1993. In April of the same year, the group won the championship in Panaad Sa Negros '93, to province-wide cultural festival in Negros Occidental.\n\nRepresented by Barangays II and Quezon, the Pintaflores street dancing contingent emerged first prize in Panaad Sa Negros in 1996. The same group with the participation of Barangay Ermita secured again the championship in Panaad Sa Negros 1997 and the fifth prize in Sinulog festival '98.\n\nIn Panaad sa Negros '98, the Pintaflores group composed of dancers from Barangays Punao and Palampas and the City Hospital graced the fiesta presentation as guest performers. In Panaad '99 the Pintaflores represented this time by elementary school children, once again proved its unbeatable streak by emerging champions, consequently reaping the Hall of Fame award for topping the fiesta presentation event in four consecutive years.\n\nHaving established a name in street dancing, Pintaflores danced performers in such places as Iloilo City (1996) and Roxas City (1997) as among the best of the best in the region, and in Canlaon City and Victorias in 1999 as the best in the province.\n\nPintaflores has evolved as a new breed of dancers emerged with the launching of Pintaflores Bata or Pinta Bata in 1996. A street dancing and ritual competition among elementary school children. Pinta Bata thrills one with the children's pleasing gracefulness and versatility that promises a crop of excellent dancers in the years to come.\n\nAfter five years and many awards, including the Hall of Fame awards in street dancing in the Panaad sa Negros, the word Pintaflores, like \"Daan Sa Kaunlaran\" and Homelot program, now has become another byword of the creativity of San Carloseños.\n\nPedicabs and Motorized tricycles are common mode of transport within the city. Buses and jeepneys provide service for inter-town travel. Local outriggers and pumpboats provide inter-island travel to and from Sipaway Island. \n\nThe city is one of the termini of the Negros Occidental Eco-Tourism Highway, numbered as N69 in the Philippine highway system. At the other end is the city of Bacolod, about 2 hours away.\n\n\nAnother historical milestone in the life of the city is the cabinet meeting of President Fidel V. Ramos in the city on August 27, 1996 making San Carlos the first component city to be made the venue of a Presidential cabinet meeting. Award-winning actress Assunta de Rossi graced the city when she married congressman Jules Ledesma. Boxer Gerry Peñalosa hails from the city. Romeo Villalva Tabuena, an artist included in the \"Who's Who\" in American arts, and has had works featured in publications like the “American Artists”, “Diplomat”, “Literary Review” and the “Reporter”, also has family roots from San Carlos. Elizabeth Ramsey, a comedian and the mother of singer Jaya, and Dr. Gerry H. Tan, Chairman on the Division of Endocrinology at Cebu Doctors’ College of Medicine - Cebu Doctors University Hospital from 1999 to present, also hails from the city. Reiven Bulado, an actor who played \"Ibo\" on an MMFF film Panaghoy sa Suba was born in San Carlos and studied highschool at \"Colegio de Santo Tomas – Recoletos\".\n\n"}

It is the fourth track from their fifth studio album, \"Americana\" (1998), and was released as the first single from the album. It achieved significant pop and rock and alternative radio play and popularity, peaking at number 53 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was a major success internationally, reaching number one in 10 countries, including Australia, where it stayed at number one for six weeks and was certified quadruple platinum. The song is a mocking portrayal of a white man who likes to act like an African-American stereotype.\n\nThe song appears as the seventh track on their \"Greatest Hits\" (2005).\n\nBeginning with a sample of the pseudo-German nonsense phrase \"Gunter glieben glauchen globen\" from Def Leppard's song \"Rock of Ages\", chanted as a replacement for the traditional \"1, 2, 3, 4\" to start the recording, the song ridicules a \"wannabe gangsta\" who is immersed in hip-hop culture not because he truly loves or understands it, but because it is trendy, makes him feel tough (\"\"Friends say he's tryin' too hard, and he's not quite hip\"/\"But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip\"\"), and because he believes it attracts women (\"\"and all the girlies say I'm pretty fly, for a white guy\"\").\n\nAs summed up by Dexter Holland, the people described in the lyrics \"are from, like, Omaha, Nebraska, regular white-bread boys, but who act like they're from Compton. It's so fake and obvious that they're trying to have an identity.\" Holland detailed that he meets many teenagers like those in his native Orange County, \"going to the mall, where they buy FUBU, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ice Cube's latest record.\" Given rap culture is the starting point, Holland clarified that it was not an attack on African-Americans, but \"poseurs of any kind\", but without wanting \"to be preachy about it... We're getting amusement out of it more than anything else.\"\n\nThe video, directed by McG, begins with the \"white guy\" and some girls singing the opening lines, and Offspring guitarist Noodles walking on the pavement with his guitar, playing the introductory riff. The \"white guy\" drives through town in his lowrider and tries to act cool in front of African-Americans, playing with his car's hydraulic system and interrupting a break dance session to dance himself. He is then carried by a group of girls to a pool party and thrown into the pool. He jumps out of the pool and finds some bikini clad dancers in front of him. These scenes are cut with the band playing. The video ends with the \"white guy\" returning home and scaring his little sister, who is wearing a fairy costume, because of his dishevelled appearance.\n\nAccording to Dexter Holland, the band wanted Seth Green to play the \"white guy\" but he was unavailable. After seeing an audition tape with \"five unknowns\", they settled on Guy Cohen, who went on to cameo in the \"Why Don't You Get a Job?\" video and occasionally appear at Offspring concerts.\n\nCassette single and 7\" black vinyl\nInitial pressing\nAustralia CD Maxi\nItaly 12\" black vinyl\nPromo 12\" black vinyl\nPromo CD\nThe music video also appears on the \"Complete Music Video Collection\" DVD. It was released in 2005. The DVD also contains a storyboard version of the video (in which the storyboard plays over top of the music video.)\n\nThe song was released as downloadable content for the video game \"Rock Band\". The song was released in the first \"Offspring pack\" which was released on October 7, 2008 along with \"Gone Away\" and \"Self Esteem\".\n\nThe song was released on the \"\" spinoff track list on December 22, 2009.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is part of the metropolitan area called Metro Bacolod, which includes the cities of Bacolod (the metropolitan center) and Talisay. It has a sizable commercial and fishing port and is the site of the new Bacolod-Silay International Airport, which replaced the old Bacolod City Domestic Airport.\n\nSilay is often referred to as the \"Paris of Negros\" due to its artists, cultural shows and large collection of perfectly preserved heritage houses. More than thirty of these houses have been declared by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines as part of the Silay National Historical Landmark. In 2015, the city celebrated its 58th charter anniversary.\n\nThe appellation \"Silay\" is derived from the name of a native tree which grew abundantly in the area. The kansilay is the city's official tree.\n\nA local legend tells of how Silay City got its name. It is said that in the days of the datus and rajahs, there once lived a princess named Kansilay. An attack on the settlement by pirates was thwarted when the princess bravely led the people in the village's defense. The fight was furious and the princess fought like a seasoned warrior. Murals that used to grace some of the city's public buildings depict her as a fierce fighter wielding a huge \"talibong\", a short native single-edged sword. The pirates were routed, but at the cost of the princess' life. Her paramour arrived in time to see her die. In grief, the people lovingly buried her. To their surprise, a tree grew right over her grave, the first Kansilay tree, a final gift from the brave princess.\n\nSilay was first settled in 1565 under the name \"\"Carobcob\"\", which means \"to scratch\" in Kinaray-a; residents of the settlement relied upon harvesting \"tuway\" clams, which involved \"scratching\" (or raking) the sands for the mollusks at low tide, as a means of livelihood. In early writings, the settlement was also referred to as \"\"Calubcub\"\", \"\"Caracol\"\" and \"\"Caraco\"\". The last two variations mean \"snail\" or a \"spiral\" in Spanish. \"Carobcob\" was built near the mouth of a creek; nothing is left of the village today. \"Carobcob\" was granted as an encomienda to Cristobal Nuñez Paroja, one of the seventeen soldiers of Miguel López de Legazpi on January 25, 1571.\n\nIn the second half of the century, Moro slave raiders escalated their incursions on the large island, forcing the \"Corregidor\" of Negros to adopt the policy of flight rather than resistance. People left their homes sometime in 1760 and settled in a new location between two small rivers, Matagoy and Panaogao. A \"paloisades\" or \"estacada\" (Spanish for \"palisade\" or \"stockade\") was constructed to protect the populace from Moro raiders. The place is now known as Sitio Estaca, its name derived from the Spanish word \"estacada\".\n\nIn 1760 Silay was recognized as a town being referred to in a letter from Governor Juan Jose de Mijares (1772–1775) mentioning Silay as a leading town in the north. In 1776, the bishop of Cebu considered Silay as the center of the parish. In 1760, it became a \"pueblo\" or town. By 1896, it had become a leading sugar-producing area because of the \"Horno Economico\" (sugar mill) built in 1846 by a Frenchman who became a permanent resident of Silay, Yves Leopold Germain Gaston.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Revolution of 1896 came a division between the sugarcane planters of Silay and the clergy. Some planters and clergy supported the rebels while others were against the revolution. On November 5 of 1898, at about 2:00 in the afternoon, residents of Silay gathered in the street corner now known as \"Cinco de Noviembre\" Street and from there they proceeded to the Spanish garrison near the Catholic Church. The encounter was bloodless. The Spanish civil guard commander, Lt. Maximiano Correa, refused to surrender. After negotiations with the revolutionaries mediated by Juan Viaplana, a local Spaniard, the Spanish garrison did surrender. A Philippine flag was raised for the first time at the Silay plaza later that afternoon. Leandro Locsin became temporary president after the signing of the terms of surrender. Timoteo Unson and the group of Silay residents then marched south to join forces with some residents of Talisay for an attack on Bacolod, the capital.\n\nOn the slopes of Mt. Silay lies Patag, the site of Imperial Japan's last stand in Negros during World War II. In 1945, U.S. military forces landed in the island. The occupying forces of the Nagano Detachment of the Imperial Japanese Army retreated to Silay and proceeded up Mt. Silay to Patag. There, they established a defensive position. Military forces of the Philippine Commonwealth and soldiers of the U.S. 40th Infantry Division proceeded up the slopes of Mt. Silay with help from Filipino soldiers of the 7th, 72nd and 75th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Negrense guerrilla fighters and defeated the Japanese defenders. Today, the site is marked by a monument dedicated to the efforts which led to the liberation of the island of Negros.\n\nSilay City had been known in the past as the \"Paris of Negros\" and the \"cultural and intellectual hub of Negros\" due to the residents' love for knowledge and works of art, and its collection of heritage mansions built during the height of the Philippine sugar industry's success, of which Negros was the very center. Most notable among these houses is Balay Negrense, the mansion of the son of the first Negrense sugar baron, Yves Leopold Germain Gaston and the Hofileña Ancestral House built by Manuel Severino Hofileña for his wife, former Miss Silay Gilda Ledesma Hojilla.\n\nSilay became a chartered city on June 12, 1957 by virtue of Republic Act 1621.\n\nOn June 7, 2003, Silay City became the first local government unit in the Republic of the Philippines to hold a referendum through a People's Initiative approving the 2003 annual executive budget. \n\nToday, Silay City is listed by the Department of Tourism as one of its 25 tourist destinations in the Philippines. It is considered the seat of arts, culture and ecotourism in the Negros Island Region.\n\nSilay is politically sub-divided into 16 barangays.\n\nIn 2016, the city of Silay created an event called \"Photowalk\", which amateurs take pictures around the city with a provided theme and create their own story out of their pictures. Years after, the city changed it to a film-making contest named as \"Cine Kahirup\".Through this, Silay City showcases the talents of young film-makers by making a short film. The said event was founded by Mr. Neil Solomon Locsin, one of the cultural advisers of the city. Film-makers make their own stories, which the committee chooses the top 15 scripts and gives financial budget to those chosen production teams. The chosen production teams have only one month to finish their films. The committee invites professional judges to critique all films. \n\nSilay City's Charter Day Anniversary Celebration marks the signing of Republic Act 1621, An Act Creating the City of Silay, which was passed by the Senate of the Republic of the Philippines on May 9, 1957 and approved by President Carlos P. Garcia on June 12, 1957. Every 12th day of June, the Silay City celebrate their annual festival called \"Hugyaw Kansilay Festival\". The theme was derived from the story of Kansilay, which is also the origin of the city's name. The festival reflects the growth of Silay; from a lowly pueblo to a city that can hold its own among the country's best. The city's festival dance depicts the setting, characters, plot, sub-plots, conflict, climax and the story of the Legend of Kansilay. \n\nThe Bacolod-Silay International Airport, serves the whole Metro Bacolod area and surrounding places. The P4.37-billion airport is capable of handling all-weather and night-landing operations. Its 2,000-meter (6,600 ft.) long and 45-meter (148 ft.) wide primary runway, and 678-meter by 23-meter taxiways can accommodate Airbus A320 family-size aircraft, and the Boeing 737, while the apron can hold five aircraft at any one time. The runway runs in a direction of 03°/21°. Provisions for a expansion of the present runway in order to accommodate even larger airplanes like the Airbus A330, Airbus A340 and Boeing 747 are now in place. The airport is expected to be the primary entrance by air to Negros Island Region.\n\nSilay is 50 minutes by air from Manila, 30 minutes by air from Cebu, 1 hour by air from Cagayan de Oro and 37.2 minutes by air from General Santos. Commercial airlines operating in the Bacolod-Silay International Airport are Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific Air, PAL Express, Zest Airways and South East Asian Airlines.\nIn Silay City, there are 31 schools that are officially listed by the city's Department of Education. \n\n\n\n\nSilay City has been twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSipalay history can be traced back to the undated time of early settlements of the natives \"Tumandok\" who discovered the lowland plains very fertile, arable and fully vegetated by trees. the areas was well dissected by river tributaries which accounted for the fertility of the lowland.\n\nDuring the Spanish era, the area was further discovered and developed by sailing adventurers from the neighboring island of Panay, being the group who resented the Kintos System enacted by the ruling Spaniards by then.\n\nGrowth and development flourished as Chinese merchants came to barter their wares with staple food, particularly rice, which was commonly called by the settlers as \"paray\" and by the Chinese, due to the difficulty of pronouncing r, as \"palay\" which was the word to have been popularly associated with the place. Thus the area came to be known as Sipalay.\n\nAt the advent of the American regime, Sipalay was a full pledge barrio of the Municipality of Cauayan. In the early 1920s the political structure was already in place.\n\nDuring the World War II, Sipalay was made an emergency town and after the war, late President Elpidio Quirino signed Executive Order No. 185 proclaiming Sipalay as a town. The official inauguration of the town was on December 20, 1948. The conversion of Sipalay into a component city of the Province of Negros Occidental followed in 2001.\n\nSipalay's distance from Bacolod City is 175 kilometers, almost a four-hour drive by public utility vehicle and over three hours by private car. Public utility vehicles plying the southern Negros route pass by this city. Those coming from Negros Oriental can either exit through Kabankalan City via Mabinay or through Dumaguete City via Hinoba-an.\n\nSipalay City is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\nMajor languages are Hiligaynon, followed by Cebuano with English and Tagalog being used as second languages.\n\nAirline company Air Juan offers services from Cebu, Iloilo and Puerto Princesa via the Sipalay Airport.\n\nThe city is known for its tourist destinations. An example of it is the now-defunct \"Maricalum Mining Corporation\" which happens to be one of the largest mining companies in the country. It now has a park dedicated for viewing the whole mine from atop.\n\nIt also boasts beautiful pristine beaches being a seaside city.

In 1788, families of Malay descent settled in the pristine part of Negros Island and named it Minuluan. Unknown to many, the sugar industry in province has its very roots in Talisay. The enterprising Recollect priest led by Fray Fernando Cuenca, spurred the economic development of this once sleepy Sitio through the planting of sugarcane in vast tracts of land we call ‘haciendas’.\n\nThe seedlings, brought from Spain, thrived well in the rich, loamy soil. Fray Cuenca improved sugar production of the crude wooden mills with the invention of ‘Molino de Agua’. The Spanish colonizers became guardians of our economic, socio-political and spiritual lives, and with more of the Minuluan population embracing the Catholic faith, the Sitio was decreed a town on September 10, 1850, with San Nicolas de Tolentino as its patron saint. It was renamed Talisay after the tree that grew in abundance along the mouth of the Matab-ang River.\n\nTo accommodate the growing population, three more barrios were established – Dos Hermanas and San Fernando in the northern part and Concepcion in the South.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Talisay became a significant player in revolt against Spain through the leadership of General Aniceto Lacson. The wily general and erstwhile Katipunero of the North teamed up with General Araneta from the South during the victorious Cinco de Noviembre uprising in 1898 that saw the Spaniards capitulating without bloodshed. The intervening years saw Talisay growing and methamorphosing into the budding city that is today-full of promise and potential. On February 11, 1998, Talisay through the effort of its local official led by the Mayor Amelo Lizares was finally elevated into a city.\n\nTalisay City is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\n\nTalisay is also known for its 2 major tertiary institutions: The Technological University of the Philippines – Visayas and Carlos Hilado Memorial State College, Main Campus.\n\nIn 2016, business process outsourcing (BPO) company iQor opens its call/contact center in Talisay, the first BPO company in the city.\n\n\n"}

During the Spanish era, Valladolid was considered one of the most prosperous towns of Negros Occidental. The size of the convent and church built by the Recollect Missionaries in 1851 were proofs of this status considering that the church authorities were powerful in running the affairs of the government.\n\nValladolid was established in 1860. The influx of settlers from the neighboring islands of Guimaras, Panay and Cebu prompted the then Governor Saravia to create an additional town which is now Pulupandan. The settlers made this town a landing area in coming to Negros, brought about by the introduction of sugar which resulted in the economic growth and prosperity of the island. The town is known as the Rice Granary of Negros Occidental with 90 percent of its arable land planted to palay. It produce more than half a million cavans of rice every year. It also produces vegetables, fruits and the diwal or angel wings shell, a seasonal delicacy.\n\nThe Aetas were the original inhabitants of Valladolid. They were ultimately forced to move to the uplands when the early settlers and colonizers came to stay. Significant events in the province during the early founding years as well as major upheavals during and after the revolutionary period brought profound changes in the municipality.\n\nBy and large, Valladolid has its place in the historical set-up of the province of Negros Occidental socially, spiritually, economically and politically. It is also the bulwark of Filipinistas Aglipayan in Negros. This dominant sect caused the defeat of the fiery Manuel L. Quezon in the hands of the Aglipayans in the presidential election of 1935 during the Commonwealth era.\n\nPasundayag Festival is a thanksgiving and celebration of good harvest. It is a farmers festival in honor of the town’s patroness, Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe featuring street dancing competition, arena festival dance showdown and merry making.\n\nIn 1957, Sitio Paloma was converted into a barrio.\n\nValladolid is located on the south-western coast of the Province of Negros Occidental. It is approximately south of Bacolod City, a 35-minute drive by private car or 45 minutes by public utility vehicles via the main highway.\n\nValladolid is bounded on the north by the town of Pulupandan, on the south by the municipality of San Enrique, on the west by the Guimaras Strait and on the east by the city of La Carlota.

{"id": "2051344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051344", "title": "Infant communion", "text": "Infant communion\n\nInfant communion, also known as paedocommunion, refers to the practice of giving the Eucharist, often in the form of consecrated wine mingled with consecrated bread, to young children. This practice is standard in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches; here, communion is given at the Divine Liturgy to all baptized and chrismated church members regardless of age. Infant communion is less common in most other Christian denominations, including the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church.\n\nSupport for infant communion is drawn from several gospel verses, including Matthew 19:14 and Mark 10:14. Among the Church Fathers, Cyprian, Augustine, and Leo the Great explicitly favored infant communion.\n\nIn the Early Church, everyone who attended the Liturgy of the Faithful was expected to receive communion; catechumens and penitents were not present for the Consecration. The Early Church permitted and encouraged parents to present their children to receive communion. The Apostolic Constitutions (fourth century) instruct that children are to receive communion after the various orders of clergy and consecrated laity and before the general congregation.\n\nWith no practical difficulties or theological qualms with giving communion to young children, this practice continues in the Eastern Orthodox Church to this day.\n\nThe practice of allowing young children to receive communion has fallen into disfavor in the Latin-Rite of the Catholic Church. Latin-Rite Catholics generally refrain from infant communion and instead have a special ceremony when the child receives his or her First Communion, usually around the age of seven or eight years old. This is in accordance with the Code of Canon Law (followed in the Roman Rite), which states:\nThe reason given for the non-necessity of infant communion was articulated by the Council of Trent:\nThus, the Council declared:\nFormerly, the Eastern Churches in full communion with the Roman Pope were generally required to conform to Western Church practice, in violation of the far more ancient practice of the Eastern Churches. However, the Second Vatican Council's decree \"Orientalium Ecclesiarum\", although not specifically addressing infant communion, states that the Council \"\"confirms and approves the ancient discipline of the sacraments existing in the Oriental Churches, as also the ritual practices connected with their celebration and administration and ardently desires that this should be re-established if circumstances warrant it\"\" (Section 12).\n\nThis has led some of these Churches to restore the ancient practice of permitting infant communion.\n\nThe \"Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches\" (followed by the Eastern Catholic Churches) permits infant communion: \"\"With respect to the participation of infants in the Divine Eucharist after baptism and chrismation with holy myron, the prescriptions of the liturgical books of each Church sui iuris are to be observed with the suitable due precautions.\"\" (Canon 710)\n\nFor details on infant communion in the Eastern Catholic Churches, see the next section on the Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, any person of any age receives communion as soon as possible after baptism and chrismation, usually at the next Divine Liturgy. Young children are not usually required to fast or go to confession before communion until they are old enough to be aware of their sins, usually eight to nine years old.\n\nIn the Orthodox practice, the consecrated bread and wine are placed together in the chalice, and the priest administers communion with a small spoon. Infants typically receive a small amount of consecrated Blood of Christ (wine) which mingles with the Body (bread) of Christ; older children receive the consecrated Body of Christ (bread) as well. There is no theological (or epistemological) reason for withholding the bread from infants, merely the practical concern of not giving solid food to those not ready for it.\n\nInfant communion is not the norm in the Lutheran Church. At most churches in the ELCA (as well as nearly 25% in the LCMS), First Communion instruction is provided to baptized children generally between the ages of 6–8 and, after a relatively short period of catechetical instruction, the children are admitted to partake of the Eucharist. In some LCMS churches, however, the person must have receive Confirmation before receiving the Eucharist. As a whole, the ELCA teaches that the gift of communion is given at baptism; it is just that some more conservative churches choose to keep a tradition that children should be more aware of what communion means before they partake. Young children can receive holy communion in the ELCA and some European Lutheran bodies along with those who haven't received the catechetical instruction (or Confirmation) may be brought to the communion distribution by their parents to be blessed by the pastor.\n\nThe Evangelical Catholic Church, a Lutheran theology-based independent denomination, differs from most Lutherans and embraces the practice of infant communion.\n\nMartin Luther's \"Table Talk\" recorded his thoughts on the subject:\nPractice varies widely throughout the Anglican Communion and among those Anglican churches that are not affiliated with the Anglican Communion. Open communion is practiced in some churches. The Church of England at the moment requires that people be \"ready and desirous\" of confirmation before receiving communion. However, there have been experiments with communion before confirmation in some of its dioceses. The Church of England also allows baptised regular communicants from other Trinitarian churches to receive communion when visiting a CofE church. This permission would seem, therefore, to extend to infants in the practice of receiving in their own churches; but in many of the world's Anglican churches the invitation so extended includes a specific reference to \"adult\" visitors.\n\nMany Mainline Protestants practice open communion, in which the bread and wine/juice is offered to the people without discrimination of age or denominational status. In these churches, while the very young often commune, it is unusual for infants to receive the Eucharist.\n\nDenominations which practice closed communion generally deny the Eucharist to those not members of their congregation or denomination, regardless of age.\n\nIn churches where membership is often not permitted until the teenage years (for example, the Amish), infant communion is very rare.\n\nIn recent years, the Eastern practice of paedocommunion has gained considerable attention in the West, including among some conservative Protestants. \n\nNotable conservative Protestants in favor of the practice are Curtis Crenshaw, Reggie Kidd, Peter Leithart, Jeffrey Meyers, Robert S. Rayburn, R. C. Sproul, Jr., Gregg Strawbridge, Ray Sutton, Douglas Wilson, Rousas John Rushdoony, James B. Jordan, Gary North, Steve Wilkins and N. T. Wright. \n\nThe Federation of Reformed Churches practices paedocommunion in all its churches as does some congregations within the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches. The Christian Reformed Church and the Reformed Episcopal Church, a conservative Anglican denomination, also are tolerant of the practice, and many conservative Presbyterians favor paedocommunion as well. In the Presbyterian Church in America, doctrinal acceptance of paedocommunion is tolerated though the practice itself is not allowed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2051345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051345", "title": "Vulture fund", "text": "Vulture fund\n\nA vulture fund is a hedge fund, private equity fund or distressed debt fund, that invests in debt considered to be very weak or in default, known as distressed securities. Investors in the fund profit by buying debt at a discounted price on a secondary market and then using numerous methods to gain a larger amount than the purchasing price. Debtors include companies, countries, and individuals.\n\nVulture funds have had success in bringing attachment and recovery actions against sovereign debtor governments, usually settling with them before realizing the attachments in forced sales. Settlements typically are made at a discount in hard or local currency or in the form of new debt issuance. In one instance involving Peru, such a seizure threatened payments to other creditors of the sovereign obliger.\n\nSovereign debt collection was rare until the 1950s when sovereign immunity of government issuers started to become restricted. This trend developed from the long history of sovereign defaulting on commercial creditors with impunity. Accordingly, sovereign debt collection actions began in the 1950s. One example was the freezing of Brazil's gold reserves held by the Federal Reserve.\n\nInvestment in sovereign debt with the intent to recover was also restricted due to the laws of champerty and maintenance and by the fact that most sovereign debt was syndicated. Under the Doctrines of Champerty, it was illegal in England and the United States to purchase a debt with the sole intent of litigating it. The distinction was made that if the debt was purchased to effect a recovery or facilitate investment, the doctrine was not a bar. Most jurisdictions have now eliminated the doctrine as archaic.\n\nSimilarly, sovereign debt owed to commercial creditors in the late 1980s was principally held by bank syndicates. This was the result of the petrodollar crisis of the 1970s when oil earnings were recycled into bank loans. The syndication of debt among banks made recovery impractical, as a fund intending to litigate had to buy out the entire syndicate of holders or risk having the proceeds of litigation attached pursuant to sharing clauses in the loan agreements.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, debt rescheduling efforts in Latin America created many new and easily traded instruments such as Brady bonds that brought new players into the market, including banks and hedge funds. The original creditors then wrote down their positions and sold the debt into the secondary market, which is a market consisting of banks and investment funds focused on buying at discounts to achieve above market returns on their investment.\n\nIn this process, much debt was repurchased and converted into local currency by the sovereign country issuers in official debt conversion programs designed to attract investment, and in severely indebted countries through World Bank funded buy-backs. The result is that the old syndicates were broken up and many unreconstructed syndicate \"tails\" were available for purchase at discounts exceeding 80% of the principal face value. That pricing encouraged funds to invest in recovery actions, which would not otherwise make financial sense due to their length and cost.\n\nBusinesses that need more capital than their founders can raise by personal contacts are enabled by this legal method of attracting investors to buy a portion of the business. Owners would invest capital and obtain common stock or equity in exchange for invested cash or other property like machines, factories, warehouses, patents or other interests. Then the owners would raise additional capital by borrowing from lenders in capital markets by selling bonds. In corporation law, the owners of these bonds come first in line for repayment so that if there is not sufficient funds to repay the bondholders, the stockholders get wiped out. The bondholders step into the shoes of the former shareholders. The shareholders own nothing because they, the owners, could not fully repay all the contractual promises, or loans. So like a bank (the mortgagee) that has lent money to a home buyer (the mortgagor) takes possession of the security (the home) when mortgage payments are not made (i.e. foreclosure), the bondholders of a corporation take possession of the business from the former owners (the shareholders) when the corporation falls into bankruptcy. Thus, when shareholders cannot repay bondholders, in principle, bondholders become the new shareholders. In practice, however, it is more complicated.\n\nIn the financial markets, the bonds of troubled public companies trade in a manner similar to common stock of solvent companies.\n\nThe term \"vulture fund\" is a metaphor which is used to compare these particular hedge funds to the behaviour of vulture birds “preying” on debtors in financial distress by purchasing the now-cheap credit on a secondary market to make a large monetary gain, in many cases leaving the debtor in a worse state. The term is often used to criticize the fund for strategically profiting from debtors that are in financial distress, and thus is frequently considered derogatory. However financiers dealing with vulture funds argue that \"their lawsuits force accountability for national borrowing, without which credit markets would shrivel, and that their pursuit of unpaid commercial debt uncovers public corruption.\" A related term is \"vulture investing\", where certain stocks in near bankrupt companies are purchased upon anticipation of asset divestiture or successful reorganization.\n\nThe term has gained wide acceptance from governments, newspapers, academics and international organizations such as the World Bank, Group of 77, Organisation of American States and Council on Foreign Relations, among others.\n\nIn 2009, bipartisan legislation in the US Congress was introduced aimed to prevent vulture funds from profiting on defaulted sovereign debt by capping the amount of profit that a secondary creditor can win through litigation based on those debts. The Stop VULTURE Funds Act was introduced, but not passed, in the United States. A non-profit financial reform organization, Jubilee USA Network, supported the legislation citing the impact that vulture funds have on poor countries. Similar legislation was passed in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Australia. The States of Guernsey debated legislation in 2012.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund and World Bank noted that vulture funds endanger the gains made by debt relief to poorest countries. \"The Bank has already delivered more than $40 billion in debt relief to 30 of these countries...thanks to this, countries like Ghana can provide micro-credit to farmers, build classrooms for their children, and fund water and sanitation projects for the poor,\" wrote World Bank Vice President Danny Leipziger in 2007. \"Yet the activities of vulture funds threaten to undermine such efforts... the strategies adopted by vulture funds divert much needed debt relief away from the poorest countries on earth and into the bank accounts of the wealthy.\"\n\nThe conduct of the vulture funds blocking payments to other creditors to Argentina was denounced by the Organisation of American States, with the exception of the United States and Canada. The G77+China also criticised the funds and stated: \"Some recent examples of the actions by vulture funds before international courts show their highly speculative nature. These funds pose a danger for all the future process of debt swaps, for developing countries and for developed nations as well\".\n\nThe US-based Council on Foreign Relations questioned the US Supreme Court for rejecting Argentina's appeal in its legal dispute with the so-called vulture funds. The organization claimed that such actions make it \"more difficult for countries to free themselves from the burden of over-indebtedness\" and are \" very bad for international capital markets\", as well as being a huge blow to national sovereignty. The organization described Thomas Griesa's ruling against Argentina in favour of vulture funds as \"punishing the innocent\" and \"turning the natural order of debt on its head\".\n\nIn 2002, the British Chancellor (and later Prime Minister) Gordon Brown told the United Nations that when vulture funds purchase debt at a reduced price, and make a profit from suing the debtor country to recover the full amount owed, the outcome is \"morally outrageous\". Legislation passed in 2010 removed the ability of vulture funds to use UK courts to enforce contested debts.\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the United Nations General Assembly voted to support a new bankruptcy process for sovereign nations, which would promote debt restructuring by excluding so-called \"vulture funds\" from the process. The vote was 124-11 in favor, with 41 abstentions. The United States voted against the measure.\n\nIn October 2016, the Irish State closed tax loopholes that U.S. distressed debt funds (labeled \"vulture funds\" in the Irish media), advised by IFSC tax-law firms (e.g. Matheson), had exploited to avoid Irish taxes (capital gain, withholding tax and VAT/duty) on over €80 billion of Irish distressed assets. The affair caused a national scandal in Ireland, and led to public backlash against the activities of US distressed debt funds, and particularly when it was discovered that they had used children's charities controlled by Irish tax-law firms to mask their Section 110 SPV tax vehicles.\n\nThe Irish State did not prosecute the \"vulture funds\" for tax avoidance, and in February 2018 the Central Bank of Ireland created a new structure the L-QIAIF, which does not file public accounts, which was how the scandal was uncovered, into which the \"vulture funds\" transferred over €55 billion of assets (one-quarter of Irish 2018 GNI*). On 28 December 2018, the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, praised the activity of \"vulture funds\" in Ireland to the \"Irish Times\" newspaper.\n\n\n"}

Players are rated even if their monsters die in the attack and can achieve a high score for what they accomplished before expiring.\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1982 in \"The Dragon\" #65 by Bruce Humphrey. Humphrey concluded that \"The game system isn't perfect, from the player/monster point of view,\" but \"The game is satisfying, however, from a fun-to-play standpoint, and that counts more.\" Jerry Pournelle stated that he was \"particularly partial\" to \"Crush\" in \"BYTE\" in 1983. He called it \"my all-time favorite\" in 1984, writing \"there's something exceedingly attractive about burning down and stomping the Pentagon flat, and in general making an even bigger mess of Washington than the politicians have\".\n\nSteve Loniewski reviewed \"Crush, Crumble and Chomp\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #14 and commented that \"\"Crush, Crumble and Chomp\" is a fine, well thought-out game that ought to keep our subdued destructive impulses at bay for one more evening.\"\n\n\nEpyx released a similar game in 1986: \"The Movie Monster Game\".\n"}

At this time, Kasr El Aini hospital had no department of obstetrics and gynaecology, and the only case of labour that he attended \"ended fatally for both mother and child\".\n\nIn June 1902, when Mahfouz was about to take his final year exams, there was an outbreak of cholera in Egypt and medical students were recruited to help combat the epidemic. The medical school was closed and exams postponed. Mahfouz was initially assigned to the Cairo railway station, to examine suspected cholera patients coming from Upper Egypt. Mahfouz paid a visit to the Health Department Director General and demanded to be sent to Mousha, a village in Upper Egypt near Assiut which was particularly hard-hit by the deadly disease and where a doctor had just succumbed to the same disease he had been sent to fight. In Mousha, young Mahfouz traced the cholera deaths to an infected well in a farmer's house. Within a week of the discovery of the well, the Mousha cholera epidemic had come to an end and so a nineteen-year-old medical student succeeded where a body of the ablest and most experienced British Public Health Department experts had failed. Mahfouz subsequently had similar success in fighting cholera in Deirout in Upper Egypt, as well as in and Alexandria.\n\nMahfouz qualified as a doctor in December 1902, coming top of his year. In 1904 and after a two-year spell at Suez hospital, he was appointed as an anaesthetist at Kasr El Aini hospital. As there was no such thing as a department of obstetrics or gynaecology at Kasr El Aini hospital, Mahfouz started a weekly gynaecological outpatient clinic. This turned out to be such a success that two whole wards were soon dedicated to obstetrical and gynaecological patients, and so the first department of obstetrics and gynaecology in Egypt came into existence. Mahfouz acquired much experience in dealing with difficult labour, partly from an agreement that he had struck with the medical officers who delivered women in their homes: whenever they faced a difficult labour, the medical officers would call Mahfouz into attendance. For his part, he would attend to the patient's house and help them deal with the most complicated cases without charging a fee. During the fifteen years to come, Mahfouz attended about two thousand women with difficult labour in their own homes. During this time, he recalls sleeping no more than two nights a week in the comfort of his own home.\nOne of the children that Naguib Mahfouz delivered after a difficult labour, was named after him in 1911. This child later became the laureate of the Nobel prize in literature, the famous novelist Naguib Mahfouz.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz was appointed as Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Kasr El Aini Hospital in January 1929, a post he occupied until he reached the age of retirement in January 1942. His term of service at Kasr El Aini was extended by five years at the unanimous request of his colleagues at the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Mahfouz was also obstetrician and gynaecologist to the Egyptian Royal Family. His pioneering work on the surgical repair of urinary and faecal fistulae brought him and Kasr El Aini hospital international acclaim. The leading lights in his speciality came all the way to Egypt to watch him repair fistulae at Kasr El Aini and the Coptic Hospital, and he was invited to lecture and show films of his operations at the Universities of London, Oxford, Edinburgh, Geneva, and Lausanne to name a few.\n\nThe absence of a maternity unit at Kasr El Aini hospital was great handicap to Naguib Mahfouz's work . Thanks to his efforts and unrelenting campaigning, the first maternity centre in Egypt came into existence at Kasr El Aini. Mahfouz reorganised the School of nursing and midwifery and taught general nursing and midwifery to its pupils for over thirty years. No less than one thousand midwives graduated under him. His two books on nursing and midwifery were used by the students for many years. In 1919, he started a pioneering scheme whereby midwives trained to the highest standards were allowed to deliver women in their own homes, a year before a similar program was started in England. In 1919, Mahfouz introduced the first antenatal clinics in Egypt, at the Kasr El Aini maternity hospital and in centres that he had opened in Cairo's deprived areas. Following this, he established a child welfare section at Kasr El Aini hospital, the first of its kind in Egypt. Many mother and child welfare centres were then built throughout the country.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz launched his Museum of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1928. By 1930, he had managed to collect three thousand of the rarest specimens in obstetrics and gynaecology obtained from his operations. He offered the museum which housed them and which was later named after him in 1932, as a gift to the Kasr El Aini Medical School. In 1945, the museum was described by the then President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of England, Sir Eardley Holland, as \"a remarkable collection\" and \" a wonderful monument to the name of its founder\". Mahfouz provided specimens to the museums of each of the universities of Ein Shams, Alexandria, Assiut and Khartoum. The Naguib Mahfouz Museum of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Kasr El Aini Medical School was renovated and relaunched in 2018.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz was a prolific author on a wide variety of subjects ranging from urinary and faecal fistulae, spinal analgesia, fibroids, ectopic pregnancy, gynaecological malignancies, pelvic infections and caesarean sections. One of his greatest achievements was the Atlas of Mahfouz's Obstetric and Gynaecological Museum, which he published in three volumes in 1949. The atlas contained pictures and slides of all the specimens found at the Mahfouz Museum of obstetrics and gynaecology. The atlas was described by Sir Eardley Holland as \"no doubt the best book that has appeared in obstetrics and gynaecology\". Other books include the celebrated History of Medical Education in Egypt which he wrote in 1935. He also wrote Principles of Gynaecology and the Art of Obstetrics, both in Arabic.\n\nIn 1919, Naguib Mahfouz was granted the Order of the Nile. In 1935, he was elected Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of England, an honour only bestowed on five eminent doctors at any one time. In 1937, he became a Fellow of each of the Royal College of Physicians of England and of the Academy of Medicine of New York. During the same year, he was granted the title of \"pasha\", the highest honour bestowed on a civilian in Egypt. In 1943, the Royal College of Surgeons of England elected Sir Winston Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek and Professor Naguib Mahfouz as Honorary Fellows of the College, the highest honour the Royal College can bestow. As Mahfouz could not make it to London because of lack of transport during World War II, the Royal College of Surgeons Council unusually enough conferred the degree on Naguib Mahfouz in Cairo. On 1 July 1947, the Royal Society of Medicine of England bestowed its Honorary Fellowship upon Professor Naguib Mahfouz together with Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of Penicillin, and an atomic scientist. During the same year, Mahfouz was also granted the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Edinburgh. Naguib Mahfouz was granted the Medal of Education as well as the King Farouk's Prize for Medical Sciences in 1951. In 1956, The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists invited Mahfouz to deliver the Fletcher Shaw Memorial Lecture, an honour only conferred on Fellows of the College \"whose research would have contributed to noticeable progress in obstetrics and gynaecology\". So many applications to attend came in, that the venue of the lecture had to be moved from the College's lecture hall to the Royal Society of Medicine in London. In 1960, President Gamal Abdel Nasser granted Mahfouz the First Class Order of Merit and the State Prize of Distinction for Science. President Anwar Sadat subsequently granted him the highest accolade post-humously.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz was married to Fayka Azmi in 1911. They had a son and four daughters. He died at the age of 92 on 25 July 1974.\n\n\n"}

Never financially stable, less than a year after it was created it was bankrupt and sold off its lines piecemeal to other railroads in 1989.\n\nThe Chicago and Alton Railroad (C&A) had built and operated lines from Chicago, Illinois to Springfield, Illinois, from Springfield to Roodhouse, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri, and from Roodhouse to Kansas City, Missouri and St. Louis, until that railroad was merged into the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad (GM&O (reporting mark GMO)) in 1947. The GM&O itself was merged into the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (ICG) in 1972. When the ICG began spinning off its redundant lines, the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway (CM&W (reporting mark CMNW)) purchased the lines from the ICG on April 28, 1987. The line struggled financially, leading to deferred maintenance on the track, and the company was bankrupt within the year.\n\nVenango River was formed by former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe managers to purchase the legendary South Shore Line from the Chessie System. The South Shore acquisition met with modest success, but whether the success correlated with management skill is still up for debate. The Chessie had all but neglected the railroad, making success easy to come by. Further, the Chessie equipped the South Shore with ten new locomotives ideal for shortline railroading, leading to low maintenance costs. Flush with success, Venango River purchased the CM&W from ICG with the South Shore as guarantor of the loans at Citibank. President John Darling had grand dreams of serving three steel mills belonging to National Steel, one in Detroit, one in Burns Harbor (on CSS), and one near St. Louis (on CM&W).\n\nCollective insight suggests Venango River overpaid for the railroad, and could not service the debt with revenues. While South Shore revenues were directed toward servicing CM&W debt for a time, when the state of Indiana failed to adequately subsidize South Shore's passenger trains, the house of cards fell. The affair was not helped by the dilapidated ex-Western Pacific EMD GP40 locomotives acquired for CM&W (only a few were repainted for CM&W). The Chicago-St. Louis line was acquired at bankruptcy sale by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and, as a result of the UP buyout, is now part of Union Pacific. The Kansas City-St. Louis (along with Roodhouse-Springfield) line was purchased by Gateway Western Railway, eventually coming under Kansas City Southern control.\n\n"}

{"id": "2051395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051395", "title": "The Hallelujah Trail", "text": "The Hallelujah Trail\n\nThe Hallelujah Trail is a 1965 American Western mockumentary spoof directed by John Sturges, with top-billed stars Burt Lancaster, Lee Remick, Jim Hutton and Pamela Tiffin. Based on the book of the same title (originally released as \"The Hallelujah Train\") by Bill Guilick in 1963.\n\nThe film was one of several large-scale widescreen, long-form \"epic\" comedies produced in the 1960s, much like \"The Great Race\" and \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", combined with the epic grandeur of the Western genre. Its running time is 2 hours, 45 minutes. The film is part of a group, which were filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 and presented in selected theaters via the oversized Super Cinerama process. Stuntman Bill Williams was killed on November 13, 1964 while performing a stunt involving a wagon going over a cliff. The scene was kept in the movie.\n\nOn October 19, 1968, three years and four months after its release, the film had its television premiere in a three-hour timeslot on \"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\".\n\nIn the year 1867, signs that the approaching winter will be a hard one produce agitation in the burgeoning mining town of Denver, as the hard-drinking citizenry fear a shortage of whiskey. Taking advice from Oracle Jones (Donald Pleasence), a local guide and seer (but only when under the influence of alcohol), the populace arrange for a mass shipment, forty wagons full of whiskey, with the Wallingham Freighting Company. The wagon train heads out, under the direction of company owner Frank Wallingham (Brian Keith), who describes himself as a \"taxpayer and a good Republican\".\n\nThis cargo becomes the target for several diverse groups, each with their own leaders and plans. Young Capt. Paul Slater (Jim Hutton) of the United States Cavalry is assigned by Fort Russell commander Col. Thaddeus Gearhart (Burt Lancaster) to escort the Wallingham Wagon Train, and merely wishes to carry out his orders. A group of Irish teamsters, hired as wagon drivers, wishes to strike unless whiskey rations are distributed. Crusading temperance leader Cora Templeton Massingale (Lee Remick) and her followers, informed of the alcoholic cargo, wish to intercept the train and destroy its contents; the group is escorted by a second cavalry division under the command of a reluctant Col. Gearhart.\n\nGearhart's daughter (Pamela Tiffin) is engaged to Slater and entranced by Mrs. Massingale's message. Despite their extremely different personalities and inability to see eye to eye, the weatherbeaten Gearhart and beautiful Cora Massingale fall in love. Beneath her composure and grace, even her occasional ribbing against him, Cora is infatuated with Gearhart from the moment he rides into the fort and spends much of the film trying subtly to win his affection.\n\nOther interested parties include Sioux Indians, led by chiefs Five Barrels (Robert J. Wilke) and Walks-Stooped-Over (Martin Landau), and a Denver citizens' militia, led by Clayton Howell (Dub Taylor) and guided by Oracle, concerned about obtaining their precious supply of drinkables. Inevitably, the various groups converge, and the ensuing property struggle is played out through a series of comic set pieces and several diplomatic overtures by an increasingly weary Gearhart. Highlights include a massive shoot-out between the concerned parties within a blinding sandstorm, a hostage situation when the Indians capture the Temperance members in order to reinforce their demands for alcoholic drink, and Massingale tricking Wallingham into riding his entire wagon train into a quicksand bog, where the wagons and their cargo sink into the pits. The participants disperse, mostly disappointed; however, for Colonel Gearhart and Captain Slater the story ends with a double wedding, for Wallingham and Oracle with a lifetime supply of whiskey when buoyancy causes the barrels to erupt from the quicksand, and for the winter of 1867 to actually become one of the mildest ever.\n\n\n\n\nThe film is presented in a pseudo-documentary style, with a tongue-in-cheek narrator (unbilled John Dehner) providing historical background and context, and periodically interrupting the story to point out animated charts illustrating strategic positions of various groups.\n\n\"The land at first — mountains… thrust forth from the molten darkness of the earth. Mountain and valley… the virgin West. High plateau… and red rock of sandstone — wilderness West. Prairie land… rolling on and on… to the end of sight. Oh, pioneer West! What fervent dreams lay half-buried in this land of promise — dreams crushed by a cruel nature — or the lance of an Indian warrior.\n\nEvery page in history must have its beginning… and ours takes us to the year eighteen sixty-seven. An Army that had fought in the War Between the States — that had bravely battled in many an Indian campaign — now patrolled the West in a time of peace… with ever-present thoughts of home. The Indian was back on the reservation… where the Peace Commission of eighteen sixty-seven had met with various warlike tribes and secured certain promises from them… in return, papers were given the Indians certifying them to be good citizens who would obey the laws of the land. Many gifts were distributed… beads… pieces of cloth… ammunition… and war surplus rifles. Naturally, these rifles were quite unfamiliar to the Indians… and, of course, it was understood, these weapons were to be used solely for the purpose of hunting game.\n\nThe leaves turned early in that year. It could be a long, hard winter. The signs were everywhere — in the high country, the morning frost would sometimes last until afternoon. Buffalo were feeding ravenously. Beaver were damming and storing with strange vigor. Horses and dogs were becoming shaggy-haired as never before. And it could be sensed in the booming, bustling mining town of Denver. Most historians agree that the events leading to the Battle of Whiskey Hills and the subsequent disaster at Quicksand Bottoms began here in Denver at a miners' meeting. Such meetings were frequent and held, usually, as part of the political fabric of the town. But the meeting of November fourth had a marked air of grim foreboding...\"\n\n\"Companies A and B of the Cavalry escorted the ex-temperance marchers back to their husbands and hungry children at Fort Russell. It is to be assumed, some time passed before the Indians were able to regain their customary composure. But it is known that the exploits of their journey became tribal legend… to be told over and over again, from generation to generation… with slight revisions. The Denver free militia dissolved… never to march again. And, of course, the strike of the Irish teamsters failed… and the Wallingham freighting company went bankrupt, having no visible assets...\n\nSo ended the great disaster at Quicksand Bottoms. Oh, yes… Mrs. Massingale… Cora Templeton Massingale retired from all active participation in temperance movements. A military wedding was held at Fort Russell. As it turned out… it was a double wedding. A homestead claim was filed by Mister Jones and Mister Wallingham on a piece of land encompassing the entire Quicksand Bottoms area…\n\nIt's not to be denied that there were occasional re-emergences of whisky kegs, which kept Mister Jones and Mister Wallingham… ehh… ehhh… quite… content for a number of years… and, in spite of all predictions, shaggy hair and busy beaver to the contrary, the winter of eighteen sixty-seven turned out to be the driest and warmest on record... Such was the year… oh, pioneer West… and the days of the Hallelujah Trail…\"\n\n\"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" (2013 edition) gives \"The Hallelujah Trail\" 2½ stars (out of 4) describing Lee Remick's character as a \"rambunctious temperance leader\" and concluding the write-up with \"amiable but lumbering Western satire goes on and on\". The capsule review also mentions that the film \"includes an overture, intermission/entr'acte, exit music\". \"Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV\" (1972–73 edition) had a much lower opinion, giving it its lowest rating of 1 star (out of 4) and deciding that there is \"[V]ery little to cheer about in this muddled western saga, as director John Sturges and the stars stumble down a long — almost three hours — and banal path that has been explored much more satisfactorily by countless film makers in the past\". Describing the plot as \"clumsy\" and singling out \"thirsty Hollywood-caricature Indians\", the review concludes that \"Lancaster looks understandably bored to death, and Lee Remick is miscast and wasted\". By the time of the 1986–87 edition, Scheuer slightly ups the rating to 1½ stars and shortens the capsule to a single sentence which calls it a \"clumsy comedy\" and mentions the \"thirsty Indians\".\n\nAs in \"Maltin\", \"The Motion Picture Guide\" (1987 edition) assigned 2½ stars (out of 5), concluding that \"[B]asically, this is one-joke plot with a few vignettes and gags strung on along the way. The whole thing is held together by an understated narration by Dehner, which itself is fairly clever. Still, the depiction of the Indians in this film is more than a little unsettling.\"\n\nTwo additional guides rank the production slightly higher and lower — Mick Martin's and Marsha Porter's \"DVD & Video Guide\" (2007 edition) dispenses 3 stars (out of 5), reminding that \"[T]hose who fondly remember television's \"F Troop\" should adore this cavalry comedy\", concluding that it is \"[O]verlong, but fun nonetheless\", while \"Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever\" (2011 edition) throws it only two bones (out of possible four), mentioning Lee Remick's \"bevy of ladies against liquor\" standing \"between the shipment and the would-be whistle whetters\" and concluding that it is a \"[L]imp Western satire directed by Preston Sturges' brother [\"Videohound\" is incorrect — the two directors were not related], who fared much better when he kept a straight face (he also directed \"The Great Escape\")\".\n\nAmong British references, Leslie Halliwell, in his \"Film and Video Guide\" (5th edition, 1985), gave no stars (Halliwell's top rating is 4), dismissing it as an \"[A]bsurdly inflated, prolonged, uninventive comedy western with poor narrative grip; all dressed up and nowhere to go\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2051423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051423", "title": "Cannabis cultivation", "text": "Cannabis cultivation\n\nThis article presents common techniques and facts regarding the cultivation of cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of its infructescences (\"buds\" or \"flowers\"). Cultivation techniques for other purposes (such as hemp production) differ.\n\nCannabis belongs to the genus \"Cannabis\" in the family Cannabaceae may include three species, \"Cannabis\", \"Cannabis saliva\", and \"Cannabis ruderalis\", (APG II system) or one variable species. It is typically a dioecious (each individual is either male or female) annual plant.\n\n\"C. sativa\" and \"C. sativa\" generally grow tall, with some varieties reaching 4 metres, or 13 feet. Female plants produce tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (up to 31% by weight) as the season changes from summer to autumn. \"C. ruderalis\" is very short, produces only trace amounts of THC, but is very rich in cannabidiol (CBD), which may be 40% of the cannabinoids in a plant and is an antagonist to THC, and it flowers independently of the photoperiod and according to age. However, commercial cross-bred hybrids containing both ruderalis, indica and/or sativa genes exist (usually called autoflowering).\n\nCannabis needs certain conditions to flourish.\n\nSoil is required, except for cannabis grown with hydroponics or aeroponics\nThe optimal day temperature range for cannabis is . Temperatures above 31 °C (88 °F) and below 15.5 °C (60 °F) seem to decrease THC potency and slow growth. At 13 °C (55 °F) the plant undergoes a mild shock, though some strains withstand frost temporarily.\n\nLight can be natural (outdoor growing) or artificial (indoor growing).\n\nUnder artificial light, the plant typically remains under a regime of 16–24 hours of light and 0–8 hours of darkness from the germination until flowering, with longer light periods being conducive to vegetative growth, and longer dark periods being conducive to flowering. However, generally cannabis only requires thirteen hours of continuous light to remain in the vegetative stage. The 'Gas Lantern Routine' is an alternate lighting schedule that has proven to be successful for growing cannabis, while saving a significant amount of energy. For optimal health, cannabis plants require a period of light and a period of dark. It has been suggested that, when subjected to a regimen of constant light without a dark period, cannabis begins to show signs of decreased photosynthetic response, lack of vigor, and an overall decrease in vascular development. Typically, flowering is induced by providing at least 12 hours per day of complete darkness. Flowering in cannabis is triggered by a hormonal reaction within the plant that is initiated by an increase in length of its dark cycle, i.e. the plant needs sufficient prolonged darkness for bract/bracteole (flowering) to begin. Some Indica varieties require as little as 8 hours of dark to begin flowering, whereas some Sativa varieties require up to 13 hours.\n\nWatering frequency and amount is determined by many factors, including temperature and light, the age, size and stage of growth of the plant and the medium's ability to retain water. A conspicuous sign of water problems is the wilting of leaves. Giving too much water can kill cannabis plants if the growing medium gets over-saturated. This is mainly due to oxygen not being able to enter the root system. Anaerobic bacteria start to accumulate due to waterlogged, stale conditions. They begin to consume plant roots, beneficial(aerobic) bacteria, as well as nutrients and fertilizer. When using soil as a growth medium, the soil should be allowed to dry adequately before re-watering.\n\nHumidity is an important part of plant growth. Dry conditions slow the rate of photosynthesis. Ideal levels of humidity for optimal growth are 40%RH-60%RH.\n\nNutrients are taken up from the soil by roots. Nutrient soil amendments (fertilizers) are added when the soil nutrients are depleted. Fertilizers can be chemical or organic, liquid or powder, and usually contain a mixture of ingredients. Commercial fertilizers indicate the levels of NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In general, cannabis needs more N than P and K during all life phases. The presence of secondary nutrients (calcium, magnesium, sulfur) is recommended. Micronutrients (e.g. iron, boron, chlorine, manganese, copper, zinc, molybdenum) rarely manifest as deficiencies.\n\nBecause cannabis' nutrient needs vary widely depending on the variety, they are usually determined by trial and error and fertilizers are applied sparingly to avoid burning the plant.\n\nGermination is the process in which the seeds sprout and the root emerges. In cannabis, it takes from 12 hours to 8 days. Warmth, darkness, and moisture initiate metabolic processes such as the activation of hormones that trigger the expansion of the embryo within the seed. Then the seed coat cracks open and a small embryonic root emerges and begins growing downward (because of gravitropism), if placed in a proper growing medium. Soon (after 2–4 days) the root is anchored and two circular embryonic leaves (cotyledons) emerge in search of light and the remains of the seed shell are pushed away. This marks the beginning of the seedling stage.\n\nGermination is initiated by soaking seeds either between wet paper towels, in a cup of water at room temperature, in wet peat pellets, or directly in potting soil. Peat pellets are often used as a germinating medium because the saturated pellets with their seedlings can be planted directly into the intended growing medium with a minimum of shock to the plant.\n\nThe seedling stage begins when the seed coat splits open and exposes the root and round “seed leaves” or cotyledons. It lasts from 1 to 4 weeks and is the period of greatest vulnerability in the life cycle of the plant, requiring moderate humidity levels, medium to high light intensity, and adequate but not excessive soil moisture. \n\nMost indoor growers use compact fluorescent or T5 fluorescent lights during this stage as they produce little heat. HPS and MH lights produce large amounts of radiant heat and increase the rate of transpiration in the plant which can quickly dry out seedlings with their small root systems.\n\nDuration: 1–2 months indoors. In this stage the plant needs a significant amount of light and nutrients, depending on the genetics of the particular plant. It continues to grow vertically and produce new leaves. The sex is starting to reveal itself, which is a sign that the next stage begins. Concurrently the root system expands downwards in search of more water and food.\n\nWhen the plant possesses seven sets of true leaves and the 8th is barely visible in the center of the growth tip, or shoot apical meristem (SAM), the plant has entered the vegetative phase of growth. During the vegetative phase, the plant directs its energy resources primarily to the growth of leaves, stems, and roots. A strong root system is required for strong floral development. A plant needs 1 or 2 months to mature before blooming. The plant is ready when it has revealed its sex. Plant size is a good indicator of sex. Females tend to be shorter and branchier due to their raceme type inflorescence than males, whose flowers grow in panicles. The males are then usually culled when they are identified, so that the females will not be pollinated, thus producing parthenocarpic fruits (popularly called \"sinsemilla\", meaning \"without seed\").\n\nDuring the vegetative phase, cultivators generally employ an 18- to 24-hour photoperiod because the plants grow more quickly if they receive more light, although a warmer and cooler period are required for optimal health. Although no dark period is required, there is debate among cultivators as to whether a dark period is beneficial, and many continue to employ a dark period. Energy savings often support using a dark period, as plants undergo late day decline and therefore lighting during the late night hours is less effective.\n\nThe amount of time to grow a cannabis plant indoors in the vegetative stage depends on the size of the flower, the light used, the size of the space, and how many plants are intended to flower at once, and how big the strain gets in \"the stretch\" (i.e., the first two weeks of flowering).\n\nCannabis cultivators employ fertilizers high in nitrogen and potassium during the vegetative stage, as well as a complete micro nutrient fertilizer. The strength of the fertilizer is gradually increased as the plants grow and become more hardy.\n\nAdvanced cultivation methods include:\n\nThe emphasis on advanced cultivation techniques, as well as the availability of hybrid strains (with names like \"Northern Lights\", \"Master Kush\", \"NYC Diesel\"), is believed to be a factor in the increase in the overall quality and variety of commercially available cannabis over the past few decades. The Internet in particular has brought together widely diverse genetics from around the world through trading and purchasing. However, well-grown heirloom strains (e.g. island sweet skunk, fruity Thai etc.) are used to produce 1 gram per watt (g/W) harvest.\n\nAlso called the \"stretch\", this takes one day to two weeks. Most plants spend 10–14 days in this period after switching the light cycle to 12 hours of darkness. Plant development increases dramatically, with the plant doubling or more in size. (See reproductive development below.) Production of more branches and nodes occurs during this stage, as the structure for flowering grows. The plant starts to develop bracts/bracteoles where the branches meet the stem (nodes). Pre-flowering indicates the plant is ready to flower.\n\nThe flowering phase varies from about 6 to 22 weeks for pure indicas with their shorter flowering time than pure sativas. Mixed indica/sativa strains have an intermediate flowering time. The sex is clearly revealed in the first phase, the actual flowering. Males produce little ball-like flowers clustered together like grapes called panicles. Most plants (except auto flowering strains that flower independently of photoperiod) begin to flower under diminishing light. In nature, cannabis plants sense the forthcoming winter as the Earth revolves about the Sun and daylight reduces in duration (see also season). The next phase consists in the fruition (or fruiting): the females inflorescences that were not pollinated (i.e.: fertilized by male pollen) start to produce infructescences that contain sticky white resin-containing glands (or trichomes) in a final attempt for pollination by windborne male pollen. The trichomes produce resins that contain the largest amounts of THC and CBN, the two main psychoactive substances. Fertilized females continue to produce resinous trichomes but more plant energy is consumed by the production of seeds, which can be half the mass of a fertilized bract; thus, to maximize resin per gram, infertile cultivation is preferred.\n\nInflorescence that produce no seeds are called \"sin semilla\" (which translates to \"without seeds\" in Spanish, and is often misspelled as one word). Potent sin semilla is especially important to medical users, to minimize the amount of cannabis they must consume to be afforded relief. Cannabis with seeds is generally considered to be of inferior quality and/or grown with inferior technique.\nCannabis grown is induced into flowering by decreasing its photoperiod to at least 10 hours of darkness per day. In order to initiate a flowering response, the number of hours of darkness must exceed a critical point. Generally the more hours of darkness each day, the shorter the overall flowering period but the lower the yield. Conversely, the fewer hours of darkness each day, the longer the overall flowering period and the higher the yield. Traditionally, most growers change their plants lighting cycle to 12 hours on and 12 hours off since this works as a happy medium to which most strains respond well. This change in photoperiod mimics the plant's natural outdoor cycle, with up to 18 hours of light per day in the summer and down to less than 12 hours of light in fall and winter. Some 'semi-autoflowering' strains that have been bred exclusively for outdoor use, particularly in outdoor climates such as that of the UK, will start flowering with as much as 16–17 hours of light per day. Usually they can start flowering in July and finish far earlier than other strains, particularly those that haven't been bred as outdoor strains. Semi-autoflowering strains can be harvested before the weather in northern latitudes becomes very wet and cold (generally October), whereas other strains are just finishing flowering, and may suffer from botrytis (grey mold) caused by wet weather. Alternatively growers may artificially induce the flowering period during the warmer months by blacking out the plants for 12 hours a day i.e. by covering the plants with black plastic for example, which excludes all light during this period so the plant can flower even during long days.\n\nAlthough the flowering hormone in most plants (including cannabis) is present during all phases of growth, it is inhibited by exposure to light. To induce flowering, the plant must be subject to at least 8 hours of darkness per day; this number is very strain-specific and most growers use 12 hours of darkness.\n\nFlowers from certain plants (e.g. cannabis) are called bract/bracteole, and are (with cannabis) the most prized part of the plant. During the late period, the bract/bracteole are easily visible to the naked eye. Bract/bracteole development begins approximately 1–2 weeks after the photoperiod is reduced. In the first weeks of flowering a plant usually doubles in size and can triple. Bract/bracteole development ends around 5 weeks into flowering and is followed by a period of bract/bracteole “swelling”. During this time the buds greatly increase in weight and size.\n\nCannabis can be grown outdoors, either on natural soil or in pots of pre-made or commercial soil. Some strains perform better than others in outdoor settings, an attribute that depends on different conditions, variables and aspects. Outdoor marijuana strains, like most other strains, can be bought in numerous locations and over a hundred different cannabis strains that are bred for outdoor growing exist—many of these outdoor cannabis seeds are simply copies of other pre-existent strains or seeds with different names and descriptions.\n\nTo generate optimum quantities of THC-containing resin, the plant needs a fertile soil and long hours of daylight. This means THC production for outdoor growth occurs optimally anywhere within 35° of the equator. Typical growing regions include Mexico, Nepal, Northern India, many parts of Africa, Afghanistan, the United States and Australia.\n\nIn most places of the subtropics, cannabis is germinated from late spring to early summer and harvested from late summer to early autumn.\nOutdoor cultivation is common in both rural and urban areas. Outdoor cultivators tend to grow indica-based strains because of its heavy yields, quick maturing time, and short stature. Some growers prefer sativa because of its clear-headed (cerebral) high, better response to sunlight, and lower odor emissions. Growers cultivate on their own property or practice guerrilla farming i.e. to plant cannabis in remote areas such as forest clearings or mountain cliffs which they rarely visit. However, such a method is prone to theft – so much so that some ingenious growers even attach pots to trees to decrease this possibility. Guerrilla growing has given birth to the activist movement Operation Overgrow, where the plant is grown with the explicit purpose of introducing the cannabis plant into the natural ecosystem.\n\nFor outdoor cultivation, growers choose areas that receive twelve hours or more of sunlight a day. In the Northern Hemisphere, growers typically plant seeds in mid-April, late May, or early June to provide plants a full four to nine months of growth. Harvest is usually between mid-September and early October. In North America, northern locations are preferred (North Coast of California and British Columbia being particularly notable), but southern locations (such as Maui, Hawaii) are also known to be good producers.\n\nWhere local laws do not permit growing cannabis, cultivators sometimes grow in forests or rugged and rural areas where the local population is unlikely to find the crop. Cannabis is also grown hidden by a crop that is taller, such as maize. This is reported by the United States government to be common in the midwestern states. Bamboo and elderberry are also used as camouflage companion plants.\n\nSome government agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), have claimed that in State and National Parks people have been injured by cannabis farmers protecting their crops using booby traps; no arrests or convictions for this had been made .\n\nCannabis can be grown indoors in a soil-like medium under artificial light, adding fertilizer when the plants are given water. Cultivating cannabis indoors is more complicated and expensive than growing outdoors, but it allows the cultivator complete control over the growing environment. Plants of any type can be grown faster indoors than out due to 24-hour light, additional atmospheric CO, and controlled humidity which allows freer CO respiration.\n\nPlants can also be grown indoors through the use of hydroponics.\n\nTo grow plants indoors, a growing medium (e.g. soil or growing substrate), water, nutrients, light and air need to be supplied to the plant (with the exception of aeroponic cultivation, in which case a growing medium is not required).\n\nThere are several different plant grow lights available. Currently the best source of light for cannabis remains to be metal halide or ceramic metal halide in the range of 3-4000k. Cannabis plants also require both dark and light photoperiods, so the lights need a timer to switch them on and off at set intervals. The optimum photoperiod depends on each plant (some prefer long days and short nights and others preferring the opposite, or something in between).\n\nRecent advancements in LED technology have allowed for diodes that emit enough energy for cannabis cultivation. These diodes can emit light in a specific nanometer range, allowing for total control over the spectrum of the light. LEDs are able to produce all of their light in the photosynthetically active range (PAR) of the spectrum.\n\nReflectors are often used in the lamps to maximize light efficiency. At a medium growing density of 15 plants and 430 watts per square meter, electricity costs are not insignificant. Plants or lights are moved as close together as possible so that they receive equal lighting and that all light coming from the lamps falls upon the plants. Maximum efficiency can be obtained by creating a slightly concave canopy such that the periphery and centre of the canopy are both at the optimum distance from the light source. Often, the distance between lamp and plant is in the range of with high pressure sodium lamps, to with other lamps, such as compact, large and high-output fluorescent lamps. With proper cooling any light type can be moved extremely close to plants to combat the inverse square law, but there are reasons to keep some distance from the canopy regardless of heat concerns; excessive light can cause bleaching of the plant material and the total canopy area contacted by light is decreased as the source is moved closer. Maximum efficiency should be obtained by maximizing the average light intensity (measured in PAR watts) per square foot times the number of square feet of plant matter contacted. Some cannabis cultivators cover the walls of their grow-room with some type of reflective material (often Mylar or Visqueen), or alternatively, white paint to maximize efficiency.\n\nOne commonly used covering is PVC plastic sheeting that is white on one side and black on the other. The plastic is installed with the white side facing into the room to reflect light, and the black facing the wall, to reduce fungus and mold growth. Another common covering is flat white paint, with a high titanium dioxide content to maximize reflectivity. Some growers consider Mylar sheeting to be very effective when it lines grow room walls, along with Astrofoil (which also reflects heat), and Foylon (a foil-laminated, reinforced fabric).\n\nWhen growing indoors, the cultivator should maintain as close to an ideal atmosphere inside the grow-room as possible. The air temperature should be maintained within a specific range, typically with deviations no larger than 10 °C (18 °F) with a cooler night and warmer day. Adequate levels of CO must be maintained for the plants to grow efficiently. It is also important to promote vigorous air circulation within the grow room, which is usually accomplished by mounting an extraction fan and one or more oscillating fans.\n\nAssuming adequate light and nutrients are available to plants, the limiting factor in plant growth is the level of carbon dioxide (CO). Ways of increasing carbon dioxide levels in the grow-room include: bottled carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide generators, a milk jug and yeast solution (in which yeast grows in a container thereby emitting CO), a baking soda and vinegar mixture in a container, or dry ice.\n\nCertain plants (e.g. most strains of cannabis) emit a distinctive odor during their reproductive phase. This presents difficulties to those who are cultivating in places where it is illegal, or for growers who may prefer discretion for other reasons. The most common way of eliminating odor is by pulling odorous air through a carbon filter. Many cultivators simply attach a large carbon filter to their air extraction system, thereby filtering any smell before the air is expelled from the grow-room. Another way of eliminating odor is by installing an ozone generator in the extraction ducting. The air is forced past the ozone generator by the extraction fan, and the odorous air is neutralized as it mixes with the ozone; however the cultivator must ensure that the air is thoroughly mixed before it is expelled outside, lest some odor escape. Care must be taken to prevent excessive ozone concentrations in the garden itself, or where it might be inhaled by the grower or his/her family. Ozone itself has a distinctive smell and is harmful to living things, although the molecule breaks down quickly (20 minutes to an hour) in atmospheric conditions.\n\nIndoors there are numerous configurations that people utilize to grow quality cannabis. Some growers will convert an entire room or closet, making it devoted to growing cannabis. A relatively new configuration involves the use of grow tents. These are plastic or metal framed tents which are covered in a strong flexible reflective plastic and have light proof zipper doors. Tents come in all sizes and many already have holes for exhaust fans/ducting as well as mounts for HID lamps.\n\nSome growers will construct grow cabinets made out of an old refrigerator, cabinet, dresser drawer or similar.\n\nIndoor growing has become increasingly common over the past decade because of the increased availability of equipment, seeds and instructions on how to cultivate. So-called grow-ops (growing operations, often located in grow houses) are seen by many marijuana enthusiasts as a much cheaper way to gain a steady, higher-quality supply of cannabis. On a larger scale they have proven a viable commercial venture, with some law enforcement agencies finding grow-ops large enough to yield several kilograms of cannabis. More expansive grow-ops are generally more susceptible to detection than smaller operations.\n\nIn the UK, so much cannabis is grown in illegal facilities that the UK is an exporter of cannabis. After cannabis as a drug was rescheduled as a Class B drug in 2008 (see below), more people started reporting on their suspicions of illegal operations and in 2009-2010 almost 7000 illegal facilities were found by police in one year. Vietnamese teenagers are trafficked to the United Kingdom and forced to work in these facilities. When police raid them, trafficked victims are typically sent to prison.\n\nBecause individual grow light power generally ranges from 250 watts to 1000 watts or more and because the lights remain lit for a long time each day, differences in utility bill costs are a significant security issue. Power companies inform law enforcement if they see a significant increase in power usage relative to a household's previous electricity costs or if power is being stolen by bypassing the meter. Employing energy saving methods is a common way to alleviate this, for instance; switching off light bulbs when leaving rooms, purchasing energy efficient appliances, using TVs or computers less, buying lower power light bulbs and so forth.\n\nSome plants (e.g. cultivars of \"C. sativa\" subsp. \"indica\"), can give off strong odors as they grow, resulting in detection of illegal growing operations. Growers frequently use carbon scrubbers and ventilation to control odors. This typically involves forcing air from the grow room through a device containing activated carbon, then venting it outdoors. Others use an ozone generator. Ozone reacts with odor molecules in the air, permanently eliminating them. However, ozone can build up to levels that may be hazardous both for grower and plant. As a last resort, keeping windows firmly shut and using strong air fresheners can control smells. Checking outside to see if any smells are emanating from indoors is often a necessary precaution, as many growers become acclimated to the smell, and fail to realize just how pervasive the odor may be. Many store plants in more isolated areas such as a basement or attic to prevent smell detection. Another less common solution is to simply grow a strain with a weaker odor.\n\nStoring plants and lights away from windows and areas that visitor may see is also common, as is keeping the plants in an attic or basement. Some growers, finding this impractical, may cover windows with light-resistant materials. This can solve the problem of escaping bright light but may arouse suspicion amongst neighbors and local residents.\n\nMany cultivators face the risk of fire. Fires normally originate from faulty electrical equipment or wiring. Shoddy fixtures and sockets, improperly grounded equipment, and overloaded circuit breakers are some of the most prevalent causes. Because of the large amount of electricity needed for large-scale cultivation, old or damaged wiring is prone to melt and short. Some commercial growers steal power to hide electricity use, and many do not ensure that their wiring is safe. Many growers adapt light cycles so that the lights are on when they are home and off when they are away.\n\nAnother fire hazard is plants making contact with hot HID bulbs. Growers using fluorescent bulbs with reasonable air circulation do not have this problem. Word of mouth can be as much a threat to growers as any of the above issues. Often, a few sentences of conversation overheard can result in a tip-off and thus speedy detection. It is for this reason that many growers are reluctant to talk about their cultivation.\n\nFor houses used as grow-ops, the interiors may have received significant structural, electrical and heating system modifications not in accordance with applicable building, natural gas and electrical codes, such as overloaded existing electrical system or a bypass circuit to avoid paying for the electricity required to power the high intensity light bulbs and fans, disconnected furnace venting, or holes in floors and walls for increased airflow. These changes replicate warm, humid climates where hybrid plants flourish and produce high potency cannabis. Such modifications may result in considerable structural damage. Cultivation over a period of time may lead to moisture and toxic mold.\n\nOne of the largest such examples was masterminded by a Markham, Ontario real estate agent, John Trac, who turned 54 rented houses into grow-ops; he was convicted and imprisoned.\n\nContractor and television presenter Mike Holmes said that while houses formerly used for growing cannabis could be bought very cheaply from banks or other owners, repairs and remediation could cost around $100,000 CAD, which may exceed price savings. Holmes noted that in one of his past jobs on Holmes on Homes, he and his crew gutted the entire house after discovering it was a grow-op.\n\nIn some municipalities, after the police raid a grow-op house they are required to contact the municipality to ensure that it is put back in good condition before being offered for sale, while real estate agents and sellers may be required by law to disclose that the home had been a grow-op. Home inspectors routinely fail to detect tell-tale signs that a house had been used as a grow-op.\n\nThere may be different goals when harvesting a plant:\n\nA typical indicator that a plant is ready to be harvested for smoking, is when most trichomes have turned cloudy and 5% to 15% of the trichomes have turned a reddish brown/amber.\n\nIn general, harvesting consists of drying and curing. Curing is an oxidization and polymerization process which takes place in sealed containers of cannabis, over time.\n\n\nRipeness is defined as the point where THC and other cannabinoid production has reached maximum levels, but before cannabinoids have begun to degrade/breakdown. This is seen under a 30x-60x microscope by examining the trichomes on the flowers. When trichomes are undeveloped they are completely clear. They turn white/cloudy which is when trichomes have max levels of cannabinoids. Eventually trichomes start turning amber/purple/red, which is when cannabinoid content has started to degrade. Harvesting before most trichomes have turned white may reduce the overall potency and efficacy time. Harvesting too late (past 15% amber) produces more of a sleepiness effect as the THC degrades to CBN.\n\nSome growers use a brix to measure \"sugar\" content.\n\nThe plants are dried at room temperature in a dark space. It is actually optimal to keep the temperature between because many terpenoids (molecules that are partially responsible for the psychoactive effects but also largely responsible for the odor of the plant) evaporate at temperatures beyond . This process can take from a few days to two weeks, depending on the size and density of the buds and the relative humidity of the air. Humidity should be kept between 45% and 55% humidity. Higher humidity will create a mold and mildew risk, while lower humidity will cause the material to dry too quickly. If the plant material dries too quickly, some of the chlorophyll will fail to be converted to a different chemical form which will result in a sub-optimal taste and a harsher smoke when combusted and inhaled. Stable temperature preserves cannabinoids well. Some believe flowers should be hung by their stalks, allowing the internal fluids of the plant to remain in the flowers. Others believe the cut stem is simply a handy non-sticky place from which to hang the plant. Roots are removed, and when the stems in the middle of the largest buds can be snapped easily, the plant is considered dry enough to be cured. Drying is done in a dark place, as THC resins deteriorate if exposed to light and the degradation product CBN forms, significantly altering the cannabinoid profile of the dried flowers.\n\nDrying the harvest is generally not considered risky by novice indoor growers of cannabis who would like to assume that they have gotten safely to the end of their \"grow\" by the time they are harvesting their plants. However, generally speaking most will underestimate the sheer scale of odor produced during the cropping, moving and hanging plants to dry. Indoor growers in areas where cultivation is illegal may consider this an obstacle in their overall efforts as the first three days of drying produces very large amounts of discernible odor (organic molecules) which the grower himself/herself may be desensitised to. These will be evaporating and likely discernible to others anywhere in the vicinity of the general area. In populated areas consideration of containment & concentration (i.e. filters) of odor molecules may be employed to reduce risk. In less populated areas with good air movement dissolution and dispersal techniques for odor management may be employed i.e. ventilation from high points such as a chimney or roof vents. Whatever method is to be employed, novice growers in illegal areas would do well to not underestimate the sheer volume of organic molecules being dissipated into the air when harvesting.\n\nCannabis is fully dry for \"curing\" when the moisture level reaches 55%-65% RH. A simple way to check this is by closing the cannabis up in an airtight glass container with a hygrometer. The container is stored for 12 hours at 22 °C (72 °F) and the hygrometer checked. 65% and above readings mean the jar needs to be opened for a few hours and then closed up, to allow more moisture to escape. The jar is again checked after 12 hours and the process repeated until a steady 55% is reached.\n\nOnce cannabis is dried to 62%, it is sealed in airtight jars to 'cure.' The minimum time for a cure is 30 days. Some growers even cure as long as six months, while others do not cure at all. As with tobacco, curing can make the cannabis more pleasant to smoke. For the same reasons as when drying, curing jars are stored in a cool, dark place.\n\nBrick weed is a curing and packaging method of cannabis cultivation that consists in drying the bud for a short period, if at all, and pressing it with a hydraulic press, compacting the whole plant (bud, stems and seeds) into a brick, hence the name brick weed. This method is mainly used in the top cannabis producing countries like Mexico and Paraguay where it is largely exported. Brick weed has a low THC level and less potent aroma and taste.\n\nOutdoor growers are likely to confront issues regarding pests. In any case (indoor or outdoor), experienced growers recommend caution when using chemical pesticides, for they may have toxic effects on the environment, the plants themselves and in turn cannabis consumers. As a general rule, experts mandate the deployment of pesticides clearly marked as \"safe to use on food crops.\" However, the EPA has not registered any pesticides for use on cannabis, making the use of any pesticide on cannabis federally illegal. Substances proven to induce little or no harm include:\n\n\nSubstances used on cannabis but not proven to induce little or no harm include:\n\nIndoor growers also have problems with pests, usually caused by the grower or a pet bringing them in from the outdoors. If caught too late, eradication of many destructive insect species indoors may be impossible until all infected plants are removed from the space and sterilization methods employed.\n\nThe modification of a plant's growth habit is called training. Indoor cultivators employ many training techniques to encourage shorter plants and denser canopy growth. For example, unless the crop is too large to be extensively pruned, cultivators remove adventitious growth shoots, often called suckers, that are near the bottom of the plant and/or receive little light and will produce poor quality buds. Some cultivators employ plant training techniques to increase yields indoors:\n\nTopping is the removal of the top of the apical meristem (dominant central stem), called the apex or terminal bud, to transfer apical dominance (the tendency for the apex to grow more rapidly than the rest of the plant) to the shoots emanating from the two nodes immediately beneath the pruning cut. This process can be repeated on one or both of the two new meristems, when they become apically dominant, with the same results. This process can actually be repeated nigh infinitely, but over-diffusion of apical dominance produces smaller, lower quality buds, so it is usually done no more than a few times. Topping also causes more rapid growth of all of the branches below the cut while the plant heals.\n\nPinching (also called \"FIMing\") is similar to topping in that it causes lower branches to grow more rapidly, but the apical meristem maintain apical dominance, which is especially useful if the plant has already been topped. Pinching is performed by firmly pinching the apical meristem(s) so as to substantially damage vascular and structural cells but without totally breaking the stem. This causes lower limbs to grow more rapidly while the pinched tissue heals, after which time the stem resumes apical dominance.\n\nLST stands for \"L\"ow \"S\"tress \"T\"raining and is another form of supercropping, many times referred to as LST super-cropping. This technique involves bending and tying the plants branches to manipulate the plant into a more preferred growth shape. This method of training works very well for indoor growers who need to illuminate their plants using overhead lights. Since light intensity greatly diminishes with increased distance (Inverse-square law), LST'ing can be used to keep all growth tips (meristems) at the same distance from the light and can achieve optimal light exposure. LST can be used in conjunction with topping, since topping increases axial growth (side shoots). Topping is often done a few weeks before beginning LST'ing. The training works by changing the distribution of hormones—more specifically auxins—in the plant. LST'ing resembles the training of grape vines into their support lattices. Outdoor gardeners also employ training techniques to keep their plants from becoming too vertical.\n\nIn contrast to the \"Screen of Green\" method, \"Sea of Green\" (or SOG) growing depends on the high density of plants (as high as 60 per square metre or 6 per square foot) to create uniformity in the crop. In this technique, which is often grown in hydroponic media, only the colas of the plants are harvested. Containers are used to enforce the geometric distribution of flowers and plant material, as well as their exposure to lighting and atmosphere. Sea of green is popular with commercial cultivators, as it minimizes the amount of time a plant spends in vegetative stage, and allows very efficient light distribution, keeping the plants much closer to the lights than when grown to full size.\n\nSCROG, short for SCReen Of Green, is an advanced training technique for cultivating cannabis, mainly indoors. Closely resembles SOG (or Sea Of Green) with the difference being that SCROG uses extensive training to produce the same field of bud effect with only one plant. Medical growers may find this a helpful technique to maximize harvest if they are only allowed a certain number of plants. A screen such as chicken wire is hung over plants so that the tips of branches are kept at the same level. This allows even light distribution to all of the nodes/bud sites. Once the flowering stage begins, the flower tips reach through the wire and are at relatively equal distances from the light source.\n\nVegetative state:\nThe plant should remain in the vegetative state until 70 to 80 percent of the net is full. As a branch reaches 7.5 to 10 centimetres (3–4 in) above the wire it is pulled back under the wire and so trained to grow horizontally until flowering. Because of the amount of plant required to fill the net, the vegetative period may require longer than normal to be ready for flowering.\n\nTiming:\nTiming is vital to the success of a SCROG grow. If the net is not full at harvest, valuable space has been wasted. If the net is too full then the buds will be too crowded to develop properly. Knowing how a plant grows can help to visualize when to flower for maximum effect.\n\nHydroponic cultivation generally occurs in greenhouses or indoors, although there is no practical obstacle to growing outdoors. In general, it consists of a non-soil medium exposed to a nutrient and water flow.\nThere are many types of hydroponic systems. If the nutrient solution floods the loose growing medium and recedes for aeration, this is an \"ebb and flow\" or \"flood and drain\" system. Systems that gradually drip solution onto the medium are \"drip systems\". Systems that intermittently spray roots floating in air are called \"aeroponic systems\". If aerated water runs down a channel lined with a film of rooting medium, this is a \"nutrient film technique\" system. A series of tubes intermittently running high flow nutrient solution into the tops of growing containers use a \"top feed system\". Aquaponics, another growing method that is gaining popularity, employs the use of fish water and recirculates that water from the fish holding tank to the growing bed.\n\nHydroponic systems greatly increase aeration of plant roots, and increase control of nutrient uptake. Hydroponic systems are decidedly more difficult to operate for the amateur or hobby grower, as over-fertilization is common, because there is no soil to act as a nutrient buffer. For this reason, many growers now use coconut fiber as a soil-less medium because of its high drainage and buffering capabilities that make it almost impossible to over-fertilize. Additionally, if a hydroponic system fails, the crop has a high probability of dying as the roots rapidly dry out (this is especially true of aeroponic systems).\n\nThere is now a new breed of hydroponic configurations such as the Omega Garden, the B-Pod and the EcoSystem Vertical Growing System that use circular designs to maximize efficiency. This consists of plants being placed or, in the case of the Omega Garden, revolving around a central light that makes maximum use of the light output.\n\nAn important factor while cultivating photoperiod independent (non-autoflowering) cannabis is selecting the best genetics for one's crop. This is frequently done by selecting one or more known strains, or strains with preferred genetics, and then growing a number plants to find which exhibit the characteristics most desirable. These genetics should typically yield at least 1 gram per watt per month of flower.\n\nPlant characteristics generally selected for include:\n\nAutoflowering cannabis strains, also known as day-neutral cannabis are a relatively new development for the home cultivator. These autoflower strains are usually crosses that contain high percentages of well known photoperiod strains and \"Cannabis ruderalis\" with its autoflowering characteristics. The plant produced from an autoflowering seeds will transition from a very short vegetative period, usually 2 to 3 weeks from germination, into flowering regardless of photoperiod. The result is that no separate vegetative and flowering lighting environment are needed. Flowering is dependent on the plants age not the time of year or ratio of light to dark hours. Autoflowers will finish from seed in 12/12, 18/6, 20/4 or even 24/0 lighting.\n\nThe first autoflowering cannabis seed on the market was the Lowryder #1. This was a hybrid between a cannabis ruderalis called William's Wonder and a Northern Lights #2. The genetics of the ruderalis was still highly present which made for a very low yield and little psychoactive effect.\n\nAfter many years of autoflower inbreeding seed makers have now come up with autoflowering strains that can produce yields close to the regular strains and still are flowering independent from the light cycle. The first autoflowering strains came from breeder STICH but now almost all major seed companies have their strains of super autoflowers that can grow up to 2 meters and produce yields up to 900 g/m of growth.\n\nInstability of gender is a desirable trait in the wild, where reproduction is the most urgent goal. In cultivation, gender predictability is more helpful, because female plants that have not been pollinated are the most productive of the psychotropic material. It is possible to use a combination of cloning and \"shocking\" of plants to get them to produce feminized seeds that reliably produce female offspring. A clone retains the same sex throughout its life, so the clone of a female plant is also female.\n\nEnvironmental stresses sometimes create pollen bearing male flowers on female plants—known as hermaphroditism or 'hermying'.\n\nA method used by organic growers and promulgated by the cannabis breeder Soma, is called 'Rodelization', or letting un-pollinated female plants live several weeks longer than the normal harvest time. In such plants a hermaphroditic trait self-expresses in an effort to continue the genetic line.\n\nSome vendors of feminized seeds assert that hermaphroditic \"parents\" do not create reliable feminized seeds, since the offspring may retain the tendency of hermaphrodytism. Others believe that this method utilizing auto-hermaphroditic traits is offset by grower observations that the tendency to auto-switch sex is no greater in plants grown from seeds made this way, than occurs naturally.\n\nColloidal silver (commonly abbreviated CS) suppresses ethylene production in bud sites, stimulating male characteristics. Spraying selected leaves, branches and – in cases where a large amount of seed is desired – whole plants with colloidal silver solution has become a preferred method of obtaining feminized seeds. Most plants treated with CS will turn intersex within 2 weeks of triweekly treatment, producing viable pollen within 4. Gibberellic acid has also been used for the same purpose, but it is harder to acquire than colloidal silver and can be difficult to dissolve into solution. One method of obtaining colloidal silver utilizes a small direct current power supply and two pieces of solid silver jeweler's wire, or silver coin.\n\nSome cultivators claim that the genes responsible for hermaphroditism are present and may be expressed under stress from any of the above methods and that once expressed, this characteristic passes to seeds regardless of what activated it. This view, in large part, is incorrect, as a random half of the genes present in each of the parental plants passes to the next generation, regardless of whether the genes that contribute to hermaphroditism were induced by stressors or not. This widely accepted Mendelian model of inheritance (Mendelian inheritance) does allow for genetic mutations that have occurred in the germline (Germline) of an organism to be passed on to any offspring, but this process applies to all DNA sequences, not just those contributing to hermaphroditism. The inheritance of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism) that are not directly coded in the DNA sequence (Epigenetics) has recently received much attention in the area of genetic research and could possibly explain any anecdotal evidence for increased hermaphroditism in the offspring of plants induced to a hermaphroditic state. However, a more likely explanation is that by propagating plants easily induced to hermaphroditism by environmental stressors, the frequency of genetic elements contributing to this trait is increased by artificial selection following traditional genetic models of inheritance. Some theories suggest it is possible to selectively breed hermaphroditic cannabis to express the female flowering before the male flowering occurs, though this kind of selective breeding is beyond the capabilities of most cultivators.\n\nWhen crossing two strains of cannabis (or two of any plant), the resultant hybrid may possess what is called \"hybrid vigor\". In general, this produces a plant that is healthier, stronger, or quicker growing than its predecessors. Sometimes, in the case of a plant that has been brought back from fruiting (fruition, as mentioned above), it may be beneficial to cross it back with another (close) relative, in the hopes that it becomes invigorated.\n\nCaution should be exercised, as one does not always attain a beneficial cross with hybridizing.\n\nLike most plants, cannabis has the potential for vegetative propagation, with the most common and simple method being cutting. Cutting is characterized as a cloning method, since the derived plants have identical DNA to the \"mother plants\".\n\nUnder appropriate environmental conditions, a cut part of the cannabis plant, typically from the main stem or a lateral branch, has the ability to produce roots and develop into a whole new plant (the clone), genetically identical to the mother. In cannabis, the production of roots may take anywhere from 5 to 21 days.\n\nThe oldest method of cannabis propagation is water cloning. Used for nearly as long as agriculture has been a part of human development, one simply sticks the cut end of clone (cutting) into a small body of water like a glass or bowl and waits. Water cloning can take longer to show roots, but is a truly natural way to propagate any plant that is able.\n\nMarijuana growers often root clones in peat pellets (compressed peat moss) or in rock wool. Another technique that has become popular for rooting clones is aeroponic cloning.\n\nThe main steps of hormonal cannabis cutting are as follows:\n\n\nPrior to the establishment of the first legal cannabis market in Colorado, United States, growers of the plant in the American State of Washington experimented with the use of cannabis waste for pig food. In early 2013, potent cannabis waste products were mixed into the feed of four pigs during the last four months of their lives, resulting in a weight increase of to that was registered before the pigs were sent to slaughter in March 2013. Washington State's draft regulations prescribe that cannabis waste must be \"rendered unusable prior to leaving a licensed producer or processor's facility,\" and adds that mixing it with food waste is acceptable. The European Food Safety Authority reported in 2011 that \"no studies concerning tolerance or effects of graded levels of THC in food-producing animals have been found in literature.\" The agency also noted that \"no data are available concerning the likely transfer of THC ... to animal tissues and eggs following repeated administration.\"\n\n\n"}

One of the original characters created for the series, Andy made his first appearance one month after the show first broadcast, in the 10th episode on 21 March 1985. Portrayed as altruistic and middle-classed, Andy and his girlfriend Debbie were an attempt to represent gentrification of the East End. Despite Davidson claiming that there had been plans for his character, Andy is the first regular character in \"EastEnders\" to be killed off. Davidson claimed this was due to an altercation between himself and Executive Producer and show creator, Julia Smith. His death scene aired in August 1986.\n\nNurse Andy O'Brien moves to Albert Square in March 1985 along with his girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy and Debbie are decidedly 'middle class', in contrast to the working class locals who inhabit the Square. Andy and Debbie have a rocky relationship. Andy wants to settle down and start a family but Debbie is not so keen and she soon attracts the attention of policeman Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding). Debbie obviously enjoys being pursued by Roy so they agree to have an open relationship. The pair continue to live together, which is not ideal for Andy, as he still has feelings for Debbie and regularly gets jealous when he sees her with other men.\n\nAndy wants to make a difference in Walford, so he occupies himself with altruistic activities, like campaigning against the demolition of the Square, and racism. When he discovers Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) is illiterate, he starts teaching her to read. This backfires when Mary decides that she is in love with him, forcing him to reject her advances. Mary is not impressed at all, and ends her reading lessons.\n\nAndy later begins an affair with the alcoholic landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). However, Angie's husband, Den (Leslie Grantham), catches them in bed together, and furiously chases a half-naked Andy into the street, which prompts a feud between the pair. It soon emerges that Angie is using Andy to make Den jealous, so their affair is short-lived and Andy soon regrets getting involved in their volatile relationship. Upon seeing that Andy is in such demand with the ladies, Debbie has a change of heart and she and Andy get back together and are soon engaged. Their happiness is short-lived as in 1986, 37-year-old Andy is mowed down by a lorry after running into the road to save a child from being hit. He is killed instantly. True to form, Andy is even altruistic in death, as his organ donor card ensures that someone gets his kidneys. Shortly before his death he has had an argument with Debbie which she finishes by telling him to \"drop dead\", which ironically, he does.\n\nAndy O'Brien was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Andy along with his girlfriend Debbie Wilkins were an attempt by Holland and Smith to represent the influx of middle-classed people that were opting to move to the usually working-class areas of the East End of London. Gentrification of the East End was on the increase in the 1980s, and in Holland's experience, the new, wealthier residents were never welcomed or truly accepted within the community, and this was what he hoped to convey on-screen with these two characters.\n\nAndy's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\".\n\nHolland required the character of Andy to be somewhere between a wimp and macho; to be on an equal footing with his partner and to represent newish thinking about the male role and equal opportunities. Ross Davidson, a sporty working-class Scot was eventually cast, although Holland and Smith felt he came across as a male chauvinist.\n\nAccording to Smith and Holland, Andy and Debbie were created to represent a young couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, but it was decided that the formula did not work and both characters were eventually written out of the show. Andy ended up being the first main character to be killed off in 1986, just over a year after the show began. During this time, rumours began to circulate in the British press that Ross Davidson was dropped because Julia Smith disapproved of the off-screen relationship he was having with Shirley Cheriton, the actress who played Debbie. This was denied by Smith in \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\".\n\nIn 1994, Davidson gave his own account of why Andy was written out of the serial to the American-based fan newspaper, \"Walford Gazette\". He stated that hostility arose between him and Smith following the recording of an \"EastEnders\" LP of cockney songs. The producer of that LP thought it would be a great idea if Davidson and Cheriton (known to be dating in real life) were to make a record of their own. Cheriton refused but Davidson accepted and took on the producer as his manager. BBC Records were not pleased and following an altercation between the head of BBC Records and the producer, Davidson had an altercation with Julia Smith, who Davidson claimed had never been happy that he and Cheriton were dating in the first place. Davidson comments, \"I made the mistake of telling off Julia Smith. She was a bit rude to me and I unfortunately reacted like a Celt.\" Their argument escalated until Smith threatened to write Andy out of \"EastEnders\", and Davidson's angry response was to tell her to kill his character off if she intended to write him out. Andy was subsequently killed in a motor accident shortly after. Davidson commented, \"I would have like to have stayed another 6 months to a year, but like a lot of their characters, it was time to move on.\"\n\nAccording to Davidson, the decision to kill Andy led to various script changes as he claims that it had been the original plan for Andy to marry Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), whom he had a brief affair with on-screen. He also claimed that Andy would have left the nursing profession to run The Dagmar winebar, which was instead given to a different character, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde).\n"}

Previously, he was a founder of social networking tool Broadband Mechanics, as well as Macromind, the company that became Macromedia.\n\nCanter grew up in a political environment. His father was a Democratic politician and organizer of a meat packers union in Chicago, and a mentor to political consultant David Axelrod. His grandfather, Harry Canter, was leader of the Communist Party of Massachusetts, a translator for the Soviet Union, and later, a publisher of communism-related books as well as a leftist weekly, the Chicago Star, that he bought from Frank Marshall Davis. Canter recalls marching with Martin Luther King, Jr. and being heavily involved in Chicago political campaigns as a child.\n\nA singer in childhood, Canter enrolled in Oberlin College intending to become an opera singer, and was exposed there to synthesizers, computer music, and building and coding computers.\n\nAfter college, Canter travelled to New York City to help his friends build a music studio called \"Noise New York.\" During this time Canter learned about laserdiscs, laser light shows, NAPLPS, pro audio and video equipment, and a then-new technology called videodiscs. Canter has also worked as a taxi driver.\n\nCanter dropped out of graduate school to work for Bally-Midway, programming music and graphics for video games. He coded one of the earliest pieces of licensed music content (\"Peter Gunn\" for Spyhunter).\n\nCanter co-founded MacroMind in 1984, the company that later became Macromedia, and began developing for the newly launched Apple Macintosh. Canter launched MacroMind with the idea of it being a \"software rock and roll band\", and the company created the first multimedia player, the first cross-platform authoring system and the world's leading multimedia platform. Partly due to his work with the company, Canter is considered one of the founders of multimedia. In the 1990s, he was the chairman of virtual technology company Canter Technology.\n\nAt MacroMind, Canter was involved in one of the first known cases of a virus being distributed via commercial software. According to the March 16, 1988 edition of the \"Toronto Star\", several MacroMind products shipped with virus infected media. Analysis later revealed that Canter's computer was infected with the virus while he was working on training material for the software products. MacroMind and Canter moved to San Francisco, California, where the company received venture capital funding and was the third software-related investment of the firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. To speed growth, Macromind engaged in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, renaming itself Macromedia in 1991.\n\nAfter being forced out of Macromedia in 1991, Canter embarked on a number of online projects, including an online interactive band (the Mediaband), an online video series (the \"Marc Canter Show\"), and an online restaurant operating system, Mediabar. It was designed to be a waterhole for shared music experiences. Through the 1990s, Canter was a \"fixture of the local tech scene\", described as a technology provocateur and advocate, part of a social and business technology community that included Robert Scoble, Ron Conway, Dave Winer, Sean Parker, Mark Pincus, and Michael Arrington, among others. He was a major proponent of the CD-ROM being a vehicle for interactive video, serendipitously around the time Windows 95 operating system was released.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Canter was involved in various startups in the formulative stages of product development and design. He was an early participant in Tribe.net and helped develop its \"tribes\" system, and early social network 'groups' technology. He consulted for Ruckus Network and Visual Media. Broadband Mechanics has also collaborated with Avid Technology.\n\nCanter and JD Lasica founded a video sharing website, Ourmedia in March 2005. Canter was founder and CEO of Broadband Mechanics, a digital lifestyle aggregator (DLA) company. Broadband Mechanics built tools and environments, including \"People Aggregator\", to enable online communities.\n\nBurnt out on venture-funded companies, and described as having burned all of his bridges in Silicon Valley, Canter and his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 2009. Intending to get out of the technology business. There, he became involved in economic development projects involving teaching multimedia coding skills to unemployed workers. Canter later returned to San Francisco.\n\nIn 2014, Canter launched Thingface, an authoring tool for developers to create Internet of things-related mobile applications. The company was later renamed Interface.\n\nIn 2015 Canter, along with four other executives, cofounded Cola, a company that launched a messaging application designed to serve as a platform for messaging-based mobile applications. Canter described the company as \"Slack for the rest of us.\"\n\nIn 2017 Canter was accused of sexual harassment. In a reply Canter apologized for using a sexual innuendo to end the relationship. He also apologized for inappropriately propositioning danah boyd for a threesome with his wife early in her career, considering his reputation in Silicon Valley. In August 2017 an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times by Melissa Batchelor Warnke called Canter's response \"clunky and tone-deaf\". Canter claimed the piece is slanderous though subsequently apologized in his own blog for the claims raised.\n\nTwo women detailed allegations of unwanted advances from Marc Canter, the co-founder of Macromedia, including Cathy Kobre who claimed Canter had said she could only remain at the company if she had sex with him. Another, Wendy Dent, said she received harassing sexual messages related to how she dressed, including \"Know what I’m thinking? Why am I sending you this — in private?” and he called her a \"sorceress casting a spell\". Dent's accusations were challenged and contextualized.\n\nCanter is a contributor to many open standards efforts and advocates for end-user controlled digital identities and content - being a co-founder of the \"Identity Gang\", and a co-signer of the Social Web Users' Bill of Rights.

Theo Epstein commented that Riske was traded because the Red Sox had too many right-handed relievers, and needed a left-hander like Lopez.

Some of the surrounding facilities included Bowlanes, A&R Course, Horse and Rider, an Exhibition hall, and a half price shoe store. At one time up to three major chain stores such as JC Penney (which J.C. Penney himself opened), Sanger-Harris, and Montgomery Ward were part of the complex. The attached Woolworths was also quite popular due to its sizable inventory and food court.\n\nThis once-popular spot in Mesquite housed department stores, retail shops, an early form of arcade, and even a movie theater (which has since been demolished). Even after Town East Mall had long since become the new \"hotspot\" for local and national retailers, the mall stayed active for several years with privately owned shops targeting urban young. Montgomery Ward, the last remaining anchor store, was closed after going bankrupt in 2001, thus sealing the mall's eventual demise.\n\nThe exterior of the mall can be seen in the 1985 film \"True Stories\" as the site of the fashion show. The interior of the mall shown is actually NorthPark Center in Dallas.\n\nIn September 2005, Big Town Mall was designated a staging point for the victims of Hurricane Katrina coming to Dallas for shelter and relief. From there, they traveled along I-30 to I-35 to settle in Reunion Arena and the Dallas Convention Center where they were housed until able to return to their homes in Louisiana. The mall's parking space was utilized as a first stop for evacuees – where authorities searched for weapons, screened them for medical conditions, gave them a light snack and passed them along to any number of shelters in Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving, Grand Prairie and even Oklahoma City.\n\nIn early 2006 the decision was made to tear down the mall and neighboring farmer's market. The demolition project started on the week of May 22, 2006, and was completed in September of that year. The Exhibition Hall is still in use with exhibitions such as gun and boat shows each weekend. As of February 2008, the City of Mesquite is working with a developer to build a sports and entertainment complex at the former mall site. The new complex will incorporate the mall's surviving structures.\n\nIt was announced in 2009 that the Big Town Bowl Lanes would close, leaving the Exhibition Hall the last operating structure on the property.\n\nAs of September 13, 2011, the Big Town Bowling Lanes were demolished. The only remaining structure on the property is the Exhibition Hall. The Exhibition Hall was remodeled in 2013 to retain current use for shows and conventions. In 2016, the site was purchased by FedEx to develop a major distribution hub.\n\n"}

Monis was also the first Jew to receive a college degree in the American colonies. His conversion to Christianity made him a figure of some controversy to both Jews and Christians.\n\nMonis was born into a family of former Portuguese conversos in Italy or the Barbary States, and was educated at Jewish academies in Livorno, Italy and Amsterdam. Monis read for Jewish congregations in Jamaica and New York, and in roughly 1715, opened a small store in New York City, where he also began a second career teaching Hebrew to Jews and Christians, as well as a pastime of conducting discussions of theological topics, such as Kabbalah and the Holy Trinity with leading Christian authorities. On February 28 of the following year, Monis was declared a freeman of the city. Around 1720, he left the established Jewish community of New York and moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where very few Jews lived at the time.\n\nAt Harvard University in Cambridge Monis received his M.A. in 1720, marking the first time a Jew had received a college degree in the American colonies and to receive an Honorary degree. As part of his graduation, Monis wrote a Hebrew grammar, entitled \"A Grammar of the Hebrew Tongue\", and in 1720 submitted a handwritten copy to the Harvard Corporation for its \"judicious perusal.\"\n\nAccording to the general assumption that a scholar should be able to study the Bible in its original languages, all upperclassmen at Harvard were required to study Hebrew. A similar policy was to be instituted at Yale by Ezra Stiles later in the century. This was regarded as a difficult and unpleasant course, one reason for this being that there was no textbook available. On April 30, 1722, the corporation voted \"That Mr. Judah Monis be approved instructor of the Hebrew Language,\" the first such position in America. He was also granted a salary of 50 pounds a year for two years. However, at that time, Harvard required all faculty to be professing Christians, and so Monis, the descendant of conversos, converted to Christianity a month before beginning his Harvard career. He was baptized in private in Harvard's College Hall and later in public. After the second baptism, Monis gave a speech in which he proved that Jesus Christ was the Messiah.\n\nThis conversion was widely criticized by both the Jewish and Christian communities; Jews expressed anger and sorrow, while Christians questioned Monis' sincerity. Monis wrote three books defending the religious reasons behind his conversion, but Cambridge First Church records speculate disapprovingly on his secret observance of the Jewish Sabbath on Saturdays. Both Church and Harvard records frequently refer to Monis as \"the converted Jew\", \"the converted rabbi\", and \"the Christianized Jew\".\n\nIn 1723, Harvard stated that it was \"greatly pleased with [Monis'] assiduity and faithfulness to his instruction\", and raised his salary to 80 pounds per year, but in 1724, transferred the responsibility for undergraduate Hebrew teaching to other tutors, with Monis responsible only for teaching graduate students and the tutors. He married Abigail Marret in First church, Cambridge on January 18, 1724. Marret was the daughter of a Cambridge hardware store owner, and Monis had met her several years previously while Monis worked there.\n\nMonis continued to use his handwritten grammar manual, but the unavailability of any Hebrew type for printing presses required that each student copy the entire text by hand, an unpopular job which took up to a month. Monis finally persuaded Harvard to import Hebrew type from London, and in 1735, with a loan from Harvard, Bostonian Jonas Green published a thousand copies of the textbook, the first Hebrew textbook printed in North America. Monis sold the books himself out of his Cambridge home, and it was a required text for all Harvard students for the ensuing 25 years. The American Jewish Historical Society possesses two copies of the printed books, as well as one of the handwritten copies.\n\nMonis' duties at Harvard continued to diminish, until by 1760 he was teaching only one class per week, at which point he retired, citing his declining health. His wife Abigail had also died that same year before his retirement. He died four years later in Cambridge and is buried in a churchyard in Northborough, Massachusetts, under a tombstone bearing the image of a grafted tree to symbolize his conversion, with an inscription reading in part:\n\n"}

Dickson, published in 1967 by Dell Publishing company. It is also the title of a novella which appeared in the October, 1964 issue of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" magazine. The shorter work constitutes about one third of the novel.\n\nIt is part of Dickson's Childe Cycle series, in which mankind has reached the stars and divided into specialized splinter groups. It takes place at roughly the same time as\" Dorsai!\", and a few characters appear in both books. Themes from the rest of the cycle are echoed here, particularly the actions of a key person, like Paul Formain, Cletus Grahame and Donal Graeme in the other novels, who can drastically affect history due to his ability to analyze and influence the behavior of others. Unlike the other protagonists, however, Tam Olyn is no hero.\n\nIn the late 23rd century, humanity has settled fifteen younger worlds around nine stars, including Earth's solar system. Although Old Earth remains populated by the traditional variety of \"full-spectrum\" people, the younger worlds have developed \"splinter\" cultures, taking very divergent paths and developing specialized cultures. Most notable of these are: the Exotics, philosophers, mystics and psychologists; the Friendlies, puritan faith-holders who supplement the meager production of their rocky worlds by hiring out as mercenaries; and the Dorsai, true professional soldiers, highly skilled and expertly trained. Other worlds have specialized in different ways, in the sciences, mining, agriculture or commerce.\n\nThe primary medium of interplanetary trade is in personal service contracts. The worlds are divided into the \"loose\" worlds, where individuals maintain some control over their contracts, and the \"tight\" worlds, where personal contracts may be bought and sold regardless of the wishes of the individual worker.\n\nThe title refers to a hymn sung by soldiers of the Friendly worlds. The first lines are \"Soldier, ask not, now or ever, where to war your banners go\".\n\nTam Olyn is an ambitious, vain, angry young man. Orphaned at a young age, and raised by a nihilist uncle, he cares little for others, with the possible exception of his younger sister, Eileen. Following his graduation from school, he is ready to launch his career as a journalist among the stars.\n\nIn a prelude to the main events of the novel, he and Eileen visit the Final Encyclopedia, a centuries-long project to try to collect and catalog all knowledge. While standing at the center of the index room, Tam is identified as a one-in-a-billion person who can actually hear the voices of humanity while there. The dying director of the Encyclopedia wants him to stay on and succeed him, but an Exotic, Padma from the planet Mara, reads him as having no identity with others, no empathy, no soul. He cannot help the Encyclopedia.\n\nHis sister has become engaged to Jamethon Black, a young mercenary from the Friendly world of Harmony. Despite the fact that Black seems a very decent young man, Tam callously manipulates his sister into breaking the engagement.\n\nShortly, he leaves Earth, beginning his profession as a newsman. In the following five years, he advances in his profession, while his sister emigrates to Cassida, and marries a young engineer there.\n\nWhile covering a war on New Earth, he finds his sister's husband, who has been drafted, and attempts to keep him out of harm's way by using him as an assistant. The plan backfires. His brother-in-law, along with several other prisoners, is slaughtered by a fanatic Friendly soldier, in violation of the laws of war. Despite the fanatic's execution for his war crime, Tam chooses to blame the entire Friendly culture, and sets out to destroy them.\n\nUnfortunately, Tam has the ability to analyze people and situations, and manipulate them expertly. Padma observes his actions, and tries to put a brake on his behavior, but he will not be stopped. By manipulating events, he creates a situation for the Friendlies that may result in their destruction as a viable culture.\n\nIn the culmination of events, he arrives to cover a war on the planet of St. Marie, a small agrarian world in the same system as Mara and Kultis, the Exotic planets. (At this point, the novella's narrative commences). On one side are the mercenary forces hired by the Exotics, led by the identical Dorsai twin brothers, Ian and Kensie Graeme. The twins, who appear in a number of other stories, are opposites in every way. Kensie is warm, friendly, loved by all, and a great leader of men. Ian is cold as ice, analytical, and a great tactician. He is respected and feared.\n\nOn the other side are a group of Friendlies who had been misled into supporting an abortive local revolution. The Friendlies are led by Jamethon Black, whose engagement Tam had broken years earlier. The Friendlies are hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered. Tam has manipulated the situation so that not only will the Friendlies lose, but their ability to hire out their soldiers will be crippled, possibly leading to the end of their viability as a culture. He believes he can link the Friendlies to assassins hired locally, against all the accepted rules of war. He tries to recruit Kensie Graeme in a scheme to expose this, but Kensie refuses and insists on prosecuting the campaign his own way.\n\nPadma is also on St. Marie. He continues to try to dissuade Tam from his quest. He explains that people from the Splinter cultures are not insane fanatics as Tam sees them, but rather a new kind of human where all the components of the human spirit are unified in a single direction. He gives Tam a copy of a secret communication between Jamethon's superiors that appears to abandon hope of them winning, and leave them to be destroyed, and further to conceal this from the troops. Tam shows this to Jamethon, who interprets it a completely different way based on his faith.\n\nThe result is a shootout between Kensie Graeme, Jamethon and a few of his lieutenants at a parley meeting in a field, with Tam as a witness. Kensie kills all the attackers despite being outnumbered and surprised, since he was expecting to discuss surrender. This leaves the Friendly forces leaderless, giving them no option but to lay down their arms.\n\nIn the end, he is thwarted only by the faith of Black, and the honor and courage of the Graeme brothers, despite the incredible cost to them. The best qualities of the splinter cultures defeat the worst qualities of Tam Olyn. Padma tells Tam that his attempt to sway Jamethon actually solved his dilemma. By rejecting what he saw as the Devil's Choice of surrendering to save his own life, Jamethon saw a way to end the conflict by sacrificing himself in a futile attempt to assassinate a vastly superior Dorsai officer. Padma gave Tam the secret document knowing that this would be the outcome.\n\nAs Padma explains to him, had Tam succeeded, not only would a necessary component of the human spirit have been lost, but the entire balance of power among the worlds would have been horribly upset. Eventually, Padma manages to break through his shell, allowing Tam to grow into more of a human being, and take his place at the Final Encyclopedia. Tam, for his part, realizes that his lust for revenge was partly to cover his shame over his fear and cowardice on New Earth.\n\nA key event in the aftermath, barely mentioned in this book, is the assassination of Kensie Graeme by agents of the original rebellion, and the manner in which his brother's honor prevents the bloodbath which could have resulted at the hands of Kensie's angry troops. These events occur after Tam has left the planet. The story is told in great detail in the short story, \"Brothers\". Padma tells Tam that his intervention has resulted in Ian Graeme transforming into an individual of unknown potential for the future. In the third novel of the trilogy, \"Dorsai!\", Ian is instrumental in leading the invasion and conquest of William of Ceta's home planet.\n\n\n"}

He also had a concurrent career as a footballer and had a long tenure with Brentford F.C.. He was born in Turnham Green and died in Tooting Bec. A right-handed batsman who occasionally bowled off breaks, Hendren was one of the most prolific batsmen of the inter-war period, averaging 47.63 in his 51 Test matches and 50.80 in all his first-class matches. He has the third highest first-class run aggregate of 57,611 runs (after Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley), and his total of 170 centuries ranks second only to Hobbs, who was a personal friend. Hendren was a noted wit, a keen practical joker and had a talent for mimicry.\n\nHendren joined the Lord's groundstaff at the age of 16, and made his first-class debut for Middlesex in 1907, though the game was abandoned after the first day when spectators caused damage to the pitch and he did not get to bat. He played nine games the following year and gradually established himself in the team, but it was 1911 before he made his first hundred, and until World War I forced the suspension of the County Championship he never managed to average 40 in a season. Hendren joined the 1st Sportsmens' Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers as a private in September 1914, before being transferred to work at a munitions factory in Royal Leamington Spa. He rejoined the Royal Fusiliers towards the end of the war.\n\nReturning to cricket in 1919 Hendren scored 1,655 runs and averaged over 60, as he was to do the following year as well. He was a strong player of fast bowling. He was made a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1920 and was picked for the 1920/21 Ashes tour, making his Test debut at Sydney and making 58 in the second innings despite Australia's huge 377-run victory. He scored two further Test fifties in the series and retained his place for the 1921 series against the same opponents, but failed completely in his four innings, totalling only 17 runs.\n\n1923 was a productive year for Hendren, as he scored 3,010 runs in the season including 13 centuries; he was recalled to the England side the following year and averaged 132.66 against South Africa. Further success was to follow as he averaged over 56 in every year from 1922 to 1928. In both 1927 and 1928 he again made 13 hundreds, in the latter year recording his highest season's aggregate of 3,311 runs.\n\nIn 1929/30, Hendren went on tour with England to the West Indies: his 693 series runs came at an average of 115.50 and included his highest Test score, 205 not out at Port of Spain; his first-class average for the tour as a whole was 135.76. He made six consecutive Test 50s (77, 205 not out, 56, 123, 61 and 55) a new England record, since equalled by Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington and Alastair Cook. Returning to England, he managed a top score of only 72 against the Australians, but in 1933 he topped 3,000 runs for the third and final time at the age of 44 and made his highest score of 301 not out.\n\nIn 1933 he invented a sort of helmet. Against the West Indies at Lord's he appeared wearing a rubber hat or cap with three peaks, two of which fitted over the sides of his head. Although a competent hooker of fast bowling he felt he needed extra protection to face bowlers such as Martindale and Constantine.\n\nHe played his final Test match in 1934/1935 at Kingston, Jamaica, the game in which George Headley made 270 not out to win the series for the West Indians, but continued to play well in domestic cricket for a few years more. Hendren's final season in the game was 1937, and fittingly he made a century in his last County Championship match, the local derby with Surrey. He did, however, appear for \"England Past and Present\" against Sir PF Warner's XI at Folkestone in September 1938, aged 49, but was caught by the 20-year-old Denis Compton for a duck in what was to be his very last first-class innings.\n\nIn 1919 he played in a Victory International for England. In retirement, he coached cricket at Harrow School (succeeding Wilfred Rhodes) and Sussex, and later acted as scorer for Middlesex (1952–1960). His health failed and he died in hospital from Alzheimer's disease at the Whittington Hospital Tooting Bec, London, at the age of 73. Seven years after his death, Hendren was the subject of a biography, titled \"'Patsy' Hendren – The Cricketer and His Times\".\n\nHendren began his football career with local team Sandersons in 1906, before having spells with QPR and Brentford in the Southern League. He was sold by Brentford to Manchester City in 1908 and appeared twice for them in the Football League First Division before moving on to Coventry City of the Southern League in October 1909. A successful first season saw Hendren make 29 appearances scoring 13 goals, but he was only to make 4 appearances in the 1910-11 season.\n\nAged 22 Hendren returned to Brentford for the 1911-12 season Maintaining both cricket and football careers meant that Hendren sometimes missed the opening games of the season during this second stint with the club, although during the 1920-21 season he made only 2 appearances due to the 1920-21 Australian Tour and made no appearances in the 1924-25 season for the same reason. He was chosen to represent the Southern League XI against the Football League XI during the 1913-14 season. Brentford rose from the Southern League to the Football League during Hendren's 15 year period with the club, and he retired from football to commit himself to cricket aged 38 having made 432 appearances in total for the club, scoring 74 goals. He was posthumously inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nHendren made one appearance for England in the unofficial Victory International against Wales in October 1919. \nPatsy's brother Denis Hendren played 9 first-class games for Middlesex. A second brother, John, was killed at Delville Wood in July 1916 while serving with the Royal Fusiliers. Hendren was a Catholic.\n\nBrentford\n\n"}

It was released in Japan on 16 October 1997 and the rest of the world on 28 October 1997. It was their first studio album since \"Painkiller\" in 1990 and the first of two studio albums the band recorded without Rob Halford and with vocalist Tim \"Ripper\" Owens.\n\nThe lyrics dealt with harsher themes than previous releases, including the eponymous mechanized demon which disembowels its prey, and the end of the world in the song \"Cathedral Spires.\" The guitars were also tuned down as low as C# and C, making a shift from the speed metal and traditional heavy metal elements of \"Painkiller\" to a more thrash/groove metal-oriented sound.\n\n\"Brain Dead\" is written from the perspective of a man who, after a tragedy, has lost the ability to move and speak and is therefore trapped in his mind, having been placed on life support. The footnote in the CD booklet for this song reads \"We all have sympathy for those left to care and despair for victims of tragedy but what of the victim himself—trapped inside his body a coffin—unable to move a muscle or blink an eye but aware of the living hell he's enduring and unable to bring it to an end—a man not even a shadow of his former self—a man who wants to be remembered for what he was—not forgotten because of what he has become.\"\n\nReaction to the album was divided among those who enjoyed it on its own terms, those who liked the music but would prefer if Halford had sung it, and those who disliked it on all counts. Glenn Tipton defended the musical changes: \"You must remember that two albums went missing between 1990 and \"Jugulator\". To us, it's not the huge leap some people see it as.\" Tim \"Ripper\" Owens opines that \"Jugulator\" is a better album than 2008's \"Nostradamus\".\n\n\"Some people felt there wasn't enough melody on \"Jugulator\",\" remarked Tipton, \"but we just weren't feeling very melodic at the time.\"\n\nIn 2018, Tim \"Ripper\" Owens pledged to re-record this album and its follow-up Demolition as he feels that his era of the band has \"been erased\".\n\nA music video was shot for the song \"Burn in Hell\", though over two minutes of the song was removed in the final video. \"Jugulator\" and \"Blood Stained\" were also included on Judas Priest's box set Metalogy.\n\n\"Bullet Train\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998.\n\nJudas Priest\n\nProduction\n"}

As fluid containing particles or cells is drawn through each microchannel, each particle causes a brief change to the electrical resistance of the liquid. The counter detects these changes in electrical resistance.\n\nThe \"Coulter principle\" states that particles pulled through an orifice, concurrent with an electric current, produce a change in impedance that is proportional to the volume of the particle traversing the orifice. This pulse in impedance originates from the displacement of electrolyte caused by the particle. The Coulter principle was named for its inventor, Wallace H. Coulter. The principle has found commercial success in the medical industry, particularly in hematology, where it can be applied to count and size the various cells that make up whole blood.\n\nCells, being poorly conductive particles, alter the effective cross-section of the conductive microchannel. If these particles are less conductive than the surrounding liquid medium, the electrical resistance across the channel increases, causing the electric current passing across the channel to briefly decrease. By monitoring such pulses in electric current, the number of particles for a given volume of fluid can be counted. The size of the electric current change is related to the size of the particle, enabling a particle size distribution to be measured, which can be correlated to mobility, surface charge, and concentration of the particles.\n\nThe Coulter counter is a vital constituent of today's hospital laboratory. Its primary function being the quick and accurate analysis of complete blood counts (often referred to as CBC). The CBC is used to determine the number or proportion of white and red blood cells in the body. Previously, this procedure involved preparing a blood cell stain and manually counting each type of cell under a microscope, a process that typically took a half-hour.\n\nCoulter counters have a wide variety of applications including paint, ceramics, glass, molten metals and food manufacture. They are also routinely employed for quality control.\n\nA Coulter counter played an important role in the development of the first ever cell sorter, and was involved in the early days of the development of flow cytometry. Even today, some flow cytometers utilize the Coulter principle to provide highly accurate information about cell size and count.\n\nMany investigators have designed a variety of devices based on the Coulter principle, and generated peer-reviewed publications featuring data generated by these devices. A few of these devices have also been commercialized. All implementations of the Coulter principle feature trade offs between sensitivity, noise shielding, solvent compatibility, speed of measurement, sample volume, dynamic range, and reliability of device manufacture.\n\nWallace H Coulter discovered the Coulter principle in the late 1940s (though a patent was not awarded until October 20, 1953). Coulter was influenced by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These events motivated Coulter to simplify and improve blood cell analysis so that large populations could be screened rapidly, as would be necessary in the event of a nuclear war. Partial funding of the project came from a grant award from the Office of Naval Research.\n\n\"Coulter principle\" refers to the use of an electric field for counting and sizing dilute suspensions of particles in conducting liquids. Wallace H. Coulter was awarded US Patent #2,656,508, \"Means for Counting Particles Suspended in a Fluid\". The Coulter principle is most commonly employed in a Coulter counter, which is an analytical instrument designed for a specific task such as counting cells. However, there are numerous other ways to implement the Coulter principle. Several of these have been attempted, some with commercial success, and some purely for academic research. To date, the most commercially successful application of the Coulter principle is in hematology, where it is used to obtain information about patients’ blood cells.\nThe Coulter principle relies on the fact that particles moving in an electric field cause measurable disturbances in that field. The magnitudes of these disturbances are proportional to the size of the particles in the field. Coulter identified several requirements necessary for practical application of this phenomenon. First, the particles should be suspended in a conducting liquid. Second, the electrical field should be physically constricted so that the movement of particles in the field causes detectable changes in the current. Finally, the particles should be dilute enough so that only one at a time passes through the physical constriction, preventing an artifact known as coincidence.\n\nWhile the Coulter principle can be implemented in a variety of designs, there are two that have become the most commercially relevant. These include an aperture format and a flow cell format. The Figure above shows several other geometries that Coulter patented.\n\nThe aperture format is used in most commercial Coulter counters. In this set up, an orifice of defined size is created in a jewel disk using special manufacturing processes. The resulting aperture is then embedded in the wall of a glass tube. The product of this process is commonly referred to as an aperture tube. While in use, the aperture tube is placed in a liquid so that the jewel disk is completely submerged and the tube can fill with liquid. Electrodes are positioned both inside and outside the aperture tube, which allows current to flow through the aperture. A pump is used to create a vacuum at the top of the tube, which draws the liquid through the aperture. Samples to be analyzed are then slowly added to the conducting liquid surrounding the aperture tube. At the start of the experiment, the electric field is turned on and the pump begins to draw the dilute suspension through the aperture. The resulting data are collected by recording the electrical pulses generated as the particles traverse the aperture.\n\nWhile the basic physical set-up of the aperture format is consistent in every Coulter counter, the amount and quality of data varies greatly as a function of the signal processing circuitry implemented. For example, amplifiers with lower noise thresholds and greater dynamic range can increase the sensitivity of the system. Similarly, digital pulse height analyzers with variable bin widths provide much higher resolution data as opposed to analog analyzers with fixed bins. Further, combining a COULTER COUNTER® with a digital computer allows capture of many electrical pulse characteristics, while analog counters typically store a much more limited amount of information about each pulse.\n\nThe flow cell format is most commonly implemented in hematology instruments, and sometimes flow cytometers. In this format, electrodes are embedded at either end of a flow channel and the electric field is applied through the channel. This format has several advantages as opposed to the aperture format. This arrangement allows for continuous sample analysis whereas the aperture format is single-batch format. Further, the use of a flow cell lends itself to addition of a sheath flow, which keeps particles centered in the middle of the flow channel. This allows measurements to be performed simultaneously, such as probing the object with a laser. The major disadvantages of the flow cell format are that it is much more expensive to manufacture and is typically fixed to one channel width, whereas the aperture format offers a wide variety of aperture sizes.\n\nThe Coulter principle has been applied to lab-on-a-chip approaches to particle detection, using microfluidics approaches that allow much smaller pores to be fabricated than can easily be achieved using the bulk methods used to fabricate traditional Coulter counters. These approaches, known by the generic phrase Microfluidic Resistive Pulse Sensing, have allowed the extension of the Coulter principle to the deep sub-micron range, allowing for example the direct detection of virus particles in fluid. Saleh and Sohn, and Fraikin et al.,\n\nAnomalous electrical pulses can be generated if the concentration of sample is so high that multiple particles enter the aperture simultaneously. This situation is known as coincidence. This occurs because there is no way to ensure that a single large pulse is the result of a single large particle or multiple small particles entering the aperture at once. To prevent this situation, samples must be fairly dilute.\n\nThe shape of the generated electrical pulse varies with the particle path through the aperture. Shoulders and other artifacts can occur because the electric field density varies across the diameter of the aperture. This variance is a result of both the physical constriction of the electric field and also the fact that the liquid velocity varies as a function of radial location in the aperture. In the flow cell format, this effect is minimized since sheath flow ensures each particle travels an almost identical path through the flow cell. In the aperture format, signal processing algorithms can be used to correct for artifacts resulting from particle path.\n\nConductive particles are a common concern for individuals considering the Coulter principle. While this topic raises interesting scientific questions, practically, it rarely affects the results of an experiment. This is because the conductivity difference between most conductive materials and ions in liquid (referred to as the discharge potential) is so great that most conductive materials act as insulators in a Coulter counter. The voltage necessary to break down this potential barrier is referred to as the breakdown voltage. For those highly conductive materials that present a problem, the voltage used during a Coulter experiment should be reduced below the breakdown potential (which can be determined empirically).\n\nThe Coulter principle measures the volume of an object, since the disturbance in the electric field is proportional to the volume of electrolyte displaced from the aperture. This leads to some confusion amongst those who are used to optical measurements from microscopes or other systems that only view two dimensions and also show the boundaries of an object. The Coulter principle, on the other hand measures three dimensions and the volume displaced by an object. It is most useful to think of sponges; even though a wet sponge may appear very large, it will displace significantly less liquid than a solid brick of the same dimensions.\n\nThe Coulter counter as invented by Wallace Coulter applies a direct current (DC) in order to count particles (cells), and produces electrical pulses of amplitude dependent on the size of cells. The cells can be modeled as electrical insulators surrounded by a conductive liquid which block a portion of the electrical path thus increasing the measured resistance momentarily. This is the most common measuring system using the Coulter principle.\n\nSubsequent inventions were able to extend the information obtained by using alternating current (AC) in order to probe the complex electrical impedance of the cells rather than just their size. The cell may then be approximately modeled as an insulating cell membrane, surrounding the cell's cytoplasm which is conductive. The thinness of the cell membrane creates an electrical capacitance between the cytoplasm and the electrolyte surrounding the cell. The electrical impedance may then be measured at one or another AC frequency. At low frequencies (well below 1 MHz) the impedance is similar to the DC resistance. However higher frequencies, in the MHz range, probe the thickness of the cell membrane (which determines its capacitance). At much higher frequencies (well above 10 MHz) however, the impedance of the membrane capacitance drops to the point where the larger contribution to the measured impedance is from the cytoplasm itself (the membrane is essentially \"shorted out\"). Using different frequencies the apparatus thus becomes much more than a counter of cells, also being sensitive to the internal structure and composition of the cells.\n\nThe most successful and important application of the Coulter principle is in the characterization of human blood cells. The technique has been used to diagnose a variety of diseases, and is the standard method for obtaining red blood cell counts (RBCs) and white blood cell counts (WBCs) as well as several other common parameters. When combined with other technologies such as fluorescence tagging and light scattering, the Coulter principle can help produce a detailed profile of patients’ blood cells.\n\nIn addition to clinical counting of blood cells (cell diameters of ~6-10 micrometres, typically), the Coulter principle has established itself as the most reliable laboratory method for counting a wide variety of cells, ranging from bacteria (< 1 micrometre in size), fat cells (~400 micrometre), plant cell aggregates (>~1200 micrometre), and stem cell embryoid bodies (~900 micrometre). \n\nThe Coulter principle has proved useful for applications well beyond cellular studies. The fact that it individually measures particles, is independent of any optical properties, is extremely sensitive, and is very reproducible has appeal to a wide variety of fields. Consequently, the Coulter principle has been adapted to the nanoscale to produce nanoparticle characterization techniques known as Microfluidic Resistive Pulse Sensing as well as one commercial venture which sells a technique it terms Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing, or TRPS. TRPS enables high-fidelity analysis of a diverse set of nanoparticles, including (but not limited to): functionalized drug delivery nanoparticles, Virus-like particles (VLPs), liposomes, exosomes, polymeric nanoparticles, microbubbles.\n\n\n"}

He retired from international duty in 2006.\n\nBorn in Harrogate, England, O'Brien began his footballing career at St John Fisher Catholic High School, Harrogate, under the stewardship of his manager, Max Mills. He joined Leeds United's academy and played in the same youth side as Harry Kewell and Jonathan Woodgate, however O'Brien was released by Leeds at the age of 14. His talent as a defender was spotted by Bradford City and joined their junior ranks in 1994. He made his senior debut in October 1996 against Queens Park Rangers. He soon became a regular in the Bradford City first team, and helped the Bantams to promotion to the FA Premier League during the 1998–99 season.\n\nHe was a regular in the Bradford City side during its two years in the Premier League, forming a partnership with club captain David Wetherall in central defence. In 2000–01, City were in financial difficulties and facing relegation when Newcastle United bid for O'Brien. After 133 league appearances he moved to St James' Park in March 2001 for a club record £2 million fee, equalling the same fee Des Hamilton had also left Bradford City to Newcastle.\n\nHe quickly became a central figure in the Magpies defence, making more than 170 league and cup appearances in the ensuing four years. His performances also earned O'Brien a call-up to the Republic of Ireland national football team. One of his first games saw him score an equaliser in a north-east derby with Sunderland, while in his first full season the club secured a place in the Champions League qualifiers. The following season the club bought defenders Titus Bramble during the summer and Jonathan Woodgate in the January transfer window and it looked like O'Brien would be third choice but over the following year manager Bobby Robson settled on O'Brien and Woodgate as his central defensive partnership.\n\nDespite several years as a solid defender at Newcastle, O'Brien suffered from poor form in the latter part of the 2004–05 campaign, as Newcastle finished a disappointing 14th in the Premiership. However, his reputation was such that Portsmouth paid £2 million to bring him to Fratton Park.\n\nO'Brien was Alain Perrin's first signing for Portsmouth. Although he started the season poorly, his form improved as the campaign wore on. However injury forced him to miss the conclusion of his first season. He fell down the Portsmouth first-team list with the arrival of Sol Campbell and the good form of club captain Linvoy Primus.\n\nThere were rumours that Sunderland's Irish boss Roy Keane would sign the centre back. This came after Keane signed many Irish players to represent Sunderland. Instead he signed for Bolton on 13 August 2007.\n\nO'Brien quickly settled at the Reebok Stadium and impressed the fans in his first few appearances as part of the Wanderers squad including a dominating performance in the UEFA Cup tie against FK Rabotnicki and in the Premier League against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nO'Brien after captaining the team in a Uefa Cup game against Sporting Lisbon he said that he is having the time of his life at Bolton.\n\nIn May 2008, his efforts were recognised by Wanderers supporters when he was named as \"The Bolton News\" Player of the Season following a poll held by the newspaper.\n\nOn 7 October 2008, O'Brien signed an extension to his contract at Bolton until 2011 and once again reaffirmed his happiness at the Reebok Stadium.\n\nOn 11 April 2009, O'Brien scored his first goal in four and a half years, and his first goal for Bolton, against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. After being a regular starter under Gary Megson, O'Brien found himself on the substitutes bench when Owen Coyle took over, with Gary Cahill and Zat Knight the preferred central defender partnership. After Middlesbrough offered to loan O'Brien from Bolton, Owen Coyle rejected the loan move preferring to keep O'Brien as backup\n\nDuring the 2010–11 season, O'Brien picked up a hamstring injury for Bolton in the Premier League game against Aston Villa. O'Brien joined Leeds United on an initial one month's loan on 29 October 2010. Manager Simon Grayson said of the move \"Andy has had a fantastic career, and has great experience. He's a leader and will be a valuable member of the squad for the next [month].\" The move saw O'Brien re-join the club he started his career at, he was released by Leeds 17 years earlier as a 14-year-old. O'Brien was given squad number 40 and made his debut for against Scunthorpe United. In November 2010, O'Brien revealed that he would be interested in possibly making his loan move to Leeds permanent. O'Brien scored his first goal for Leeds with a header against Hull City. On 24 November, the loan was extended until 4 January 2011.\n\nAfter a two-game spell on the sidelines with injury, O'Brien returned to Leeds' starting lineup against Leicester City. O'Brien scored two own goals against his former club Portsmouth. On 30 December, manager Simon Grayson confirmed he wanted to sign O'Brien permanently. O'Brien was also subject of interest from Cardiff City.\n\nOn 1 January 2011, O'Brien signed a permanent deal with Leeds United on a -year contract, which took effect after his loan deal came to an end on 4 January 2011. He turned down a lucrative offer from Cardiff City, opting to move permanently to Leeds. On 8 January, O'Brien put in an impressive performance to help earn Leeds a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, Leeds were 1–0 up when Robert Snodgrass scored a second half penalty, Arsenal equalised in the 90th minute when Cesc Fàbregas scored a penalty. O'Brien picked up an injury in the FA Cup replay against Arsenal and subsequently missed the game against his former club Portsmouth. O'Brien scored his second goal for Leeds in the 3–2 loss against Millwall.\n\nAfter picking up a hip injury during the 2011–12 pre-season he missed all the pre-season games, to return against his former club Newcastle United. Then stepped up his recovery against Leicester City in a behind closed doors friendly. The summer also saw O'Brien take the number 5 shirt after previously occupying the number 40 shirt. O'Brien started for Leeds the opening day of the season as they crashed to a 3–1 defeat against Southampton, with O'Brien at fault for the second goal when his backwards header was converted by Adam Lallana. He was given a torrid time against his former club Bradford City and was substituted to loud jeers in the second half with Leeds 2–1 down. Leeds went on to win the game 3–2. O'Brien dropped out of the Leeds squad for the following game on 13 August against Middlesbrough in a match Leeds lost 1–0.\n\nAfter nearly three months out of the side, O'Brien returned to the Leeds team due to the suspension and injury of Tom Lees and Darren O'Dea and helped Leeds keep a clean sheet against Leicester City on 6 November. O'Brien was linked with a loan move to West Ham during November, however manager Simon Grayson revealed he wasn't looking to send O'Brien out on loan.\n\nAfter Leeds 2–1 win against Burnley on 19 November, manager Simon Grayson revealed post match, that O'Brien had come to him the day before the game and refused to play for Leeds ever again. Grayson subsequently stated that O'Brien's career at Leeds was now over due to his refusal to play, however, it later emerged O'Brien's refusal to play was down to the fact he was at time suffering from depression and was \"not in the right state of mind\" when he stated he would no longer play for Leeds. After manager Simon Grayson was sacked, O'Brien played his first game for Leeds as a substitute against Coventry City.\n\nHe was transfer listed by Neil Warnock at the end of the 2011–12 season and told to find a new club. On 4 May 2012, O'Brien lost his squad number, when the number 5 shirt previously occupied by him was given to new signing Jason Pearce.\n\nOn 1 August 2012, O'Brien moved to Canadian MLS club Vancouver Whitecaps FC on a free transfer from Leeds United. Having signed a two-year contract, he made his debut on 8 August against Real Salt Lake. In his second MLS season, having already made 25 appearances in his first year of service, it was announced that he had signed a one-year extension with the Whitecaps. After the conclusion of the 2014 campaign, O'Brien entered into contract talks with the Whitecaps, but the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. After 50 appearances for the club, it was announced that Whitecaps were \"moving in a different direction,\" and thanked O'Brien publicly on Twitter.\n\nO'Brien has dual British-Irish citizenship, and despite representing England at under 18 and under 21 level, he elected to represent the Republic of Ireland at under 21 and senior level. O'Brien's performances for Newcastle led to him being called up to the Republic of Ireland national football team, earning his first cap against Estonia in Tallinn in 2001. He later became a regular in the Irish squad, and was included as part of their 2002 World Cup squad. He scored his first, and ultimately only, goal for Ireland to give his country a 1–0 win against Portugal on 9 February 2005.\n\nAfter being picked for the squad to face Brazil on 6 February 2008, he did not report for training on 3 February 2008 and Ireland caretaker manager Don Givens received a message from O'Brien announcing his retirement from international football. He played 26 games for Ireland, with his last coming against Cyprus on 7 October 2006.\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\n\n"}

Together they use Tracey's inventions for all kinds of purposes, like school competitions or simply for fun. Tracey lives in a house and Shamus on the fifteenth floor of a tall apartment building. Shamus loves gardening organically and Tracey loves inventing devices and contraptions. Tracey uses a caravan in her backyard for inventing. The caravan, white with a horizontal thick red stripe, has an antenna, and a computer and many devices and parts within. Tracey's younger sister, Megan, often annoys Tracey to the extent that she will invent something to stop this annoyance. The antagonists are the McConnolly brothers, who go to Tracey's school. They often are rivals of McBean though lacking much intelligence and often are either culprits or annoy Tracey and Shamus is some manner.

It was inaugurated in 1993.\n\nThe Promenade plantée is an extensive green belt that follows the old Vincennes railway line. Beginning just east of the Opéra Bastille with the elevated Viaduc des Arts, it follows a path eastward that ends at a spiral staircase leading to the boulevard Périphérique beltway. At its west end near the Bastille, the parkway rises 10 m above the surrounding area and forms the Viaduc des Arts, over a line of shops featuring high quality and expensive arts and crafts. The shops are located in the arches of the former elevated railway viaduct, with the parkway being supported atop the viaduct. This portion of the parkway runs parallel to the avenue Daumesnil. The parkway intersects the Jardin de Reuilly near the rue Montgallet and descends to street level. At that point, it becomes a grassy mall and then follows the old railway direction below street level towards the east, passing through several tunnels. As it reaches the rue du Sahel, it splits, with one portion continuing to the beltway, and the other terminating in the square Charles-Péguy along the former path of a branch line that once linked to the Petite Ceinture railway.\n\nThe elevated part of the route, on the viaduct, has some enclosed sections, as when it passes between modern buildings, and some open sections with expansive views. In addition to the Jardin de Reuilly and the square Charles-Péguy, the Promenade Plantée also includes the Jardin de la gare de Reuilly, with its preserved but unused railway station, and the square Hector-Malot. Other abandoned railways have been converted into parks and parkways, but the Promenade Plantée was the first green space constructed on an elevated viaduct.\n\nThe western portion of the parkway may be accessed via stairways and elevators leading up to the elevated viaduct. This portion is reserved for pedestrians. The eastern portion of the parkway is accessible via ramps and stairways and is open to both pedestrians and cyclists. The west end can be reached from Bastille by walking 300 m south on Rue de Lyon, then left on Avenue Daumesnil. The staircase entrance is immediately on the left where Avenue Daumesnil enters rue de Lyon.\n\nThe Promenade Plantée is built on the former tracks of the Vincennes railway line, which beginning in 1859 linked the Bastille station to Verneuil-l'Étang, passing through Vincennes. It ceased operation on December 14, 1969; part of the line beyond Vincennes was integrated into Line A of the RER, while the Paris-Vincennes section was completely abandoned.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the area was renovated. In 1984, the Bastille station was demolished to make way for the Opéra Bastille. The Reuilly area was designed in 1986; it incorporates the old commercial rail depot of Reuilly into a group of park areas. The Promenade Plantée was put into place at the same time in order to reuse the rest of the abandoned line between the Bastille and the old Montempoivre gate to the city. Landscape architect Jacques Vergely and architect Philippe Mathieux designed the parkway, which was inaugurated in 1993. The arcades of the Viaduc des Arts were renovated in 1989 by architect Patrick Berger, as was the new square Charles-Péguy.\n\nParis' parkway was the only elevated park in the world for some years, until the first phase of the High Line, a similar park on an old railway-viaduct in the West Side of Manhattan New York City, was completed in 2009. The second phase was completed in 2011, bringing the total length of the High Line to 1 mile; the third phase opened in September 2014, completing the park. Chicago has recently opened the nearly 3-mile Bloomingdale Trail, which will run through several city neighborhoods and allow bicycles.\n\nThe Promenade Plantée appears in the film \"Before Sunset,\" directed by Richard Linklater in 2004 with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. It is also mentioned in the science fiction novel \"Olympos,\" by Dan Simmons.\n\n\n"}

The members of the act were the singer Nicole Heiland and the rappers Dean \"Dirty-D\" Burke and Patrice \"Lady Scar\" Gansau. Their music is written and produced by Mike Michaels, Mark \"MM\" Dollar and Mark Tabak, who are also behind the artists and bands such as Music Instructor, The Boyz and Ayman. Dean Burke has also worked with Music Instructor and Lunatics. Highland as an act; however, existed only for a few years. The lyrics of the tracks were written by Hardy Krech, Mark Nissen and Toni Berardi. The project was produced by Hardy Krech and Mark Nissen (Elephant Music) and co-produced by Triple M. and Andreas Pohle.\n\nTheir first single, \"Bella Stella\", the refrain of which was performed in Italian by Nicole Heiland and the raps performed by Dean Burke and Patrice \"Lady Scar\" Gansau in English, was released in late 1999, which eventually became a hit entering the top-10 both in Germany and Austria, also reaching number 12 in Switzerland. In 2000, they released the album also entitled \"Bella Stella\", which peaked at number 52 in Germany and number 87 in Switzerland. Three more singles were released: \"Se Tu Vuoi\", which structure-wise followed the same technique as its predecessor peaking at number 20 on the German single chart and number 12 on the Swiss chart, their third single \"Solo Tu\" charted moderately reaching number 47 in Germany and 62 in Switzerland, this single; however, differed from the former two singles. It was a pleasant europop dance track with only Nicole Heiland's refrain performed in Italian as usual and the spoken/singing produced in English by Patrice \"Lady Scar\" Gansau. The fourth single \"Veni Vidi Vici\" (which sounded very much like the first two singles) consisted (on the album version) out of only female rap produced by Gansau and the refrain performed in Italian by Heiland, while the radio version and extended mix also contained male rap produced by Dean Burke. The track managed to chart only in Germany eventually peaking at 59 position on the single chart.\n\nIn 2001, Highland also released the single \"Magic Fortuna\", which was based on \"O Fortuna\", a movement from Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\". The song comprised Eurodance tunes as well as Heiland's vocals (in Latin) performed along with other male-vocals in the background. The single peaked at number 33 in Germany and charted moderately in other German-speaking countries peaking at number 80 in Switzerland and 66 in Austria.\n\nThe act released their second album \"Dimmi Perché\" in 2008. It featured remastered versions of some of their previous hits, this time without the rap performances, and eight new songs.

{"id": "2051536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051536", "title": "Corona (optical phenomenon)", "text": "Corona (optical phenomenon)\n\nIn meteorology, a corona (plural \"coronae\") is an optical phenomenon produced by the diffraction of sunlight or moonlight (or, occasionally, bright starlight or planetlight) by individual small water droplets and sometimes tiny ice crystals of a cloud or on a foggy glass surface. In its full form, a corona consists of several concentric, pastel-colored rings around the celestial object and a central bright area called \"aureole\". The aureole is often (especially in case of the Moon) the only visible part of the corona and has the appearance of a bluish-white disk which fades to reddish-brown towards the edge. The angular diameter of a corona depends on the sizes of the water droplets involved; smaller droplets produce larger coronae. For the same reason, the corona is the most pronounced when the size of the droplets is most uniform. Coronae differ from halos in that the latter are formed by refraction (rather than diffraction) from comparatively large rather than small ice crystals.\n\nPollen suspended in the air can also cause diffraction of sunlight that produces coronae. Because pollen grains are not always spherical, the resulting pollen coronae often have characteristic elliptic shape and brighter spots in them. They can be seen during blooming season where there is significant source of pollen like forests. They are more easily seen during sunset or sunrise as there is less sun glare and the light path through pollen laden atmosphere is longer.\n\n"}

{"id": "2051540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051540", "title": "Flashback (narrative)", "text": "Flashback (narrative)\n\nA flashback (sometimes called an analepsis) is an interjected scene that takes the narrative back in time from the current point in the story. Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened before the story's primary sequence of events to fill in crucial backstory. In the opposite direction, a flashforward (or prolepsis) reveals events that will occur in the future. Both flashback and flashforward are used to cohere a story, develop a character, or add structure to the narrative. In literature, internal analepsis is a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative; external analepsis is a flashback to a time before the narrative started.\n\nIn film, flashbacks depict the subjective experience of a character by showing a memory of a previous event and they are often used to \"resolve an enigma\". Flashbacks are important in film noir and melodrama films. In movies and television, several camera techniques, editing approaches and special effects have evolved to alert the viewer that the action shown is a flashback or flashforward; for example, the edges of the picture may be deliberately blurred, photography may be jarring or choppy, or unusual coloration or sepia tone, or monochrome when most of the story is in full color, may be used. The scene may fade or dissolve, often with the camera focused on the face of the character and there is typically a voice-over by a narrator (who is often, but not always, the character who is experiencing the memory).\n\nAn early example of analepsis is in the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", where the main story is narrated through a frame story set at a later time. Another ancient example occurs in the \"Odyssey\", in which the tale of Odysseus' wanderings is told in flashback by Odysseus to a listener. Another early use of this device in a murder mystery was in \"The Three Apples\", an \"Arabian Nights\" tale. The story begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder in a series of flashbacks leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story. Flashbacks are also employed in several other \"Arabian Nights\" tales such as \"Sinbad the Sailor\" and \"The City of Brass\".\n\nAnalepsis was used extensively by author Ford Madox Ford, and by poet, author, historian and mythologist Robert Graves. The 1927 book \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" by Thornton Wilder is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks of events leading up to the disaster. Analepsis is also used in \"Night\" by Elie Wiesel. If flashbacks are extensive and in chronological order, one can say that these form the present of the story, while the rest of the story consists of flash forwards. If flashbacks are presented in non-chronological order, the time at which the story takes place can be ambiguous: An example of such an occurrence is in \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" where the narrative jumps back and forth in time, so there is no actual present time line. \"Os Lusíadas\" is a story about voyage of Vasco da Gama to India and back. The narration starts when they were arriving Africa but it quickly flashes back to the beginning of the story which is when they were leaving Portugal.\n\nThe \"Harry Potter\" series employs a magical device called a Pensieve, which changes the nature of flashbacks from a mere narrative device to an event directly experienced by the characters, who are thus able to provide commentary.\n\nThe creator of the flashback technique in cinema was \"Histoire d’un crime\" directed by Ferdinand Zecca in 1901. Flashbacks were first employed during the sound era in Rouben Mamoulian's 1931 film \"City Streets\", but were rare until about 1939 when, in William Wyler's \"Wuthering Heights\" as in Emily Brontë's original novel, the housekeeper Ellen narrates the main story to overnight visitor Mr. Lockwood, who has witnessed Heathcliff's frantic pursuit of what is apparently a ghost. More famously, also in 1939, Marcel Carné's movie \"Le Jour Se Lève\" is told almost entirely through flashback: the story starts with the murder of a man in a hotel. While the murderer, played by Jean Gabin, is surrounded by the police, several flashbacks tell the story of why he killed the man at the beginning of the movie.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a flashback is in the Orson Welles' film \"Citizen Kane\" (1941). The protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, dies at the beginning, uttering the word \"Rosebud\". The remainder of the film is framed by a reporter's interviewing Kane's friends and associates, in a futile effort to discover what the word meant to Kane. As the interviews proceed, pieces of Kane's life unfold in flashback, but Welles' use of such unconventional flashbacks was thought to have been influenced by William K. Howard's \"The Power and the Glory\". Lubitsch used a flashback in \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1943) which tells the story of Henry Van Cleve. Though usually used to clarify plot or backstory, flashbacks can also act as an unreliable narrator. The multiple and contradictory staged reconstructions of a crime in Errol Morris's 1988 documentary \"The Thin Blue Line\" are presented as flashbacks based on divergent testimony. Akira Kurosawa's 1950 \"Rashomon\" does this in the most celebrated fictional use of contested multiple testimonies.\n\nSometimes a flashback is inserted into a film even though there was none in the original source from which the film was adapted. The 1956 film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's stage musical \"Carousel\" used a flashback device which somewhat takes the impact away from a very dramatic plot development later in the film. This was done because the plot of \"Carousel\" was then considered unusually strong for a film musical. In the film version of \"Camelot\" (1967), according to Alan Jay Lerner, a flashback was added not to soften the blow of a later plot development but because the stage show had been criticized for shifting too abruptly in tone from near-comedy to tragedy.\n\nIn Billy Wilder's film noir \"Double Indemnity\" (1944), a flashback from the main character is used to provide a confession to his fraudulent and criminal activities.\n\nA good example of both flashback and flashforward is the first scene of \"La Jetée\" (1962). As we learn a few minutes later, what we are seeing in that scene is a flashback to the past, since the present of the film's diegesis is a time directly following World War III. However, as we learn at the very end of the film, that scene also doubles as a prolepsis, since the dying man the boy is seeing is, in fact, himself. In other words, he is proleptically seeing his own death. We thus have an analepsis and prolepsis in the very same scene.\n\nOccasionally, a story may contain a flashback within a flashback, with the earliest known example appearing in Jacques Feyder's \"L'Atlantide\". \"Little Annie Rooney\" (1925) contains a flashback scene in a Chinese laundry, with a flashback within that flashback in the corner of the screen. In John Ford's \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962), the main action of the film is told in flashback, with the scene of Liberty Valance's murder occurring as a flashback within that flashback. Other examples that contains flashbacks within flashbacks are the 1968 Japanese film \"Lone Wolf Isazo\" and 2004's \"The Phantom of the Opera\", where almost the entire film (set in 1870) is told as a flashback from 1919 (in black-and-white) and contains other flashbacks; for example, Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a freak show. An extremely convoluted story may contain flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, as in \"Six Degrees of Separation\", \"Passage to Marseille\", and \"The Locket\". \n\nThis technique is a hallmark of Kannada movie director Upendra. He has employed this technique in his movies - \"Om\" (1995), \"A\"(1998) and the futuristic flick \"Super\" (2010) - set in 2030 containing multiple flashbacks ranging from 2010 to 2015 depicting a Utopian India.\n\nSatyajit Ray experimented with flashbacks in \"The Adversary\" (Pratidwandi, 1972), pioneering the technique of photo-negative flashbacks.He also uses flashbacks in other films such as Nayak(1966), Kapurush- O - Mahapurush ( 1965) , Aranyer Din Ratri(1970), Jalsaghar(1959).In fact , in Nayak , the entire film proceeds in a non linear narrative which explores the Hero( Arindam' s) past through seven flashbacks and two dreams .He also uses extensive flashbacks in the Kanchenjunga(1962).\n\nQuentin Tarantino makes extensive use of the flashback and flashforward in many of his films. In \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992), for example, scenes of the story present are intercut with various flashbacks to give each character's backstory and motivation additional context. In \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), which uses a highly nonlinear narrative, traditional flashback is also used in the sequence titled \"The Gold Watch\". Other films, such as his two-part \"Kill Bill\" (Part I 2003, Part II 2004), also feature a narrative that bounces between present time and flashbacks.\n\nThe television series Quantico, \"Kung Fu\", \"Psych\", \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"Grounded for Life\", \"Once Upon a Time,\" and \"I Didn't Do It\" use flashbacks in every episode. Flashbacks were also a predominant feature of the television shows \"Lost\", \"Arrow\", \"Orange Is the New Black\", \"13 Reasons Why\", \"Elite\" and \"Quicksand\". Many detective shows routinely use flashback in the last act to reveal the culprit's plot, e.g. \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"Banacek,\" \"Columbo.\"\n\n"}

He was Senior Research Officer for the famous Robbins Committee on Higher Education. This committee's report led to the massive expansion of UK university education in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nFollowing research on happiness begun in the 1970s by economists such as Richard Easterlin at the University of Southern California, he has written about the economics of happiness, with one theme being the importance of non-income variables on aggregate happiness, including mental health.\n\nHis main current interest is how better mental health could improve our social and economic life. His work on mental health, including publishing The Depression Report in 2006, led to the establishment of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme in England. He is co-editor of the World Happiness Report, with John F. Helliwell and Jeffrey Sachs.\n\nPeter Richard Grenville Layard is the son of John Layard. He was educated at Eton, where he was a King's scholar; at King's College, Cambridge (he is a member of the semi-secretive Cambridge Apostles society); and at the London School of Economics.\n\nLayard assisted Claus Moser on the Robbins enquiry, and later developed a reputation in the economics of education (with Mark Blaug at LSE), and labour economics (in particular with Stephen Nickell). He advocated many of the policies which characterised the New Labour government, particularly the New Deal, partly by founding the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. One approach he took is based on the idea of welfare-to-work, where social welfare payments are structured in a way that encourages (or forces) recipients back into the job market.\n\nAs well as academic positions, Layard worked as an advisor for numerous organisations, including government institutions in the United Kingdom and Russia.\n\nIn 1990 he was founder-director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. where he is presently programme director.\n\nLayard became active in the study of what has since come to be known as happiness economics. This branch of economic analysis starts from the argument that income is a bad approximation for happiness. Based on modern happiness research, he cites three factors that economists fail to take into consideration:\n\n\nFrom these observations, Layard concludes that taxes serve another purpose besides paying for public services (usually for public goods) and redistributing income. The third purpose is to counteract the cognitive bias that causes people to work more than is good for their happiness. That is, taxes should help citizens preserve a healthy work-life balance.\n\nIn 2005 Layard published the book \"Happiness: Lessons from a New Science\", in which he emphasised the importance of non-income variables on aggregate happiness. His book summarises the prior empirical findings produced by economists such as Richard Easterlin, David G Blanchflower, Andrew E Clark, Rafael Di Tella, Robert MacCulloch, and Andrew Oswald. In particular he stressed the role of mental health and argued that psychological treatments ought to be much more widely available.\n\nSubsequent books have included \"Happiness: Lessons from a new science\" (2011), \"The Origins of Happiness\" (2018), and \"Can We Be Happier?: Evidence and Ethics\" (2020).\n\nIn 2012 he co-edited, with Jeffrey Sachs and John Helliwell, the World Happiness Report, and has been involved in subsequent years.\n\nLayard's mental health work\nresulted in the development of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), an initiative to improve access to psychological therapies in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn 2014, with the clinical psychologist David M Clark, he published the book \"Thrive: The Power of Evidence-Based Psychological Therapies\", in which the authors demonstrate the potential value of the wider availability of modern talking therapies, and include a chapter on mental illness prevention.\n\nLayard has shown that mental illness is the main cause of unhappiness.\n\nIn 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025.\n\nRecent research on happiness questioning part of Baron Layard's thesis and suggesting that people do obtain happiness from increased income forms part of ongoing investigations into the Easterlin Paradox.\n\nLayard was made a Labour life peer in the House of Lords on 3 May 2000 as Baron Layard, of Highgate in the London Borough of Haringey.\n\nIn 1991, he married Molly Christine Meacher, who was formerly married to Michael Meacher. Molly, styled Lady Layard between 2000 and 2006, was herself created a life peer in 2006 as Baroness Meacher. They are one of the few couples to both hold titles in their own right.\n\nLayard has said he was strongly Christian at school, lost his faith at university, and in his later years 'has to be believe there is some purpose in the universe... which gives me comfort.'\n\nIn 2003, Layard was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In 2016, he was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences (FAcSS).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2051564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2051564", "title": "Deathlands", "text": "Deathlands\n\nDeathlands is a series of novels published by Gold Eagle Publishing. The first novel \"Pilgrimage to Hell\" was first published in 1986. This series of novels was first written by Christopher Lowder, under the pen name \"Jack Adrian\". Mr. Lowder became ill after developing the plot and writing most of the book. Laurence James, under the pen name \"James Axler\" then finished the story.\n\nThe series exists in both an episodic style and a series format. Some of the novels can be read out of order yet others are dependent on the previous release. There are also a few trilogy sets within the series.\n\nOn the morning of January 20, 2001 the climax of the Cold War set the post-apocalyptic stage for the series. The end game began with a pre-emptive strike on Washington. Underground nuclear bombs were detonated from within the basement of the Soviet embassy, by an elite group of Spetsnaz operatives, destroying the central command structure and political system of the United States. For an indefinite period of time a nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union devastated both countries and subsequently the entire planet (but little details are known outside both countries). All manner of genetic contagions were released infecting the survivors of the firestorm with horrible illnesses. The remaining survivors lived harshly during a time of prolonged nuclear winter known as 'Skydark'. The geography, climate, and ecosystems of the world had changed dramatically. What was left of the United States came to be known as the Deathlands.\n\n100 years later civilization begins again: brutal, short lived, morally confused and crazed from mutation. Between the many hot spots are small plague pits ruled by power hungry individuals who have no limits in order to establish their rule and expand their influence. These individuals are known as the Barons. Their rabble pits are known as Villes and Baronies. Civilization unknowingly resembles the Dark Ages. Trading resumes between the villes: Jack (a regional currency), Jolt (a hallucinogenic mixture of Mescaline and Heroin) and slaves are the primary forms of currency. Life is a strange mixture of ancient history and limited technology that is scrapped from the 20th century. Military technology is the most prized possession of all; success is often measured by the number of bullets he or she possesses. A man named Ryan Cawdor leads a group of companions across the deathlands. Ryan has extremely secret knowledge of the 20th century. The understanding of hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that contains Teleportation technology. He and his companions guard this knowledge with their lives. The technology is called MAT-TRANS.\n\nEach novel usually begins with the companions arriving at a frequently unknown redoubt by MAT-TRANS. If the situation is impossible or hostile the companions can use the \"last destination\" feature of the transporter to return to the sending location. If the redoubt is unknown then the companions usually explore, looking for weapons and supplies which they rarely find. Sometimes they are lucky and find a working shower or stored food which they always utilize or take. The story picks up speed once the characters leave the redoubt and explore the surrounding countryside. Frequently the companions are captured or forced into a confrontation with the local barons. Each novel reveals a little of the characters' history, motivations and the regional location where they arrived.\n\n\nOver the course of the series, Ryan Cawdor and his band have fought and defeated countless power-mad villains, and most died within one book. Many villains were Barons- rulers of small dictatorships scattered across The Deathlands (notably, Barons are also the primary antagonists of the sequel series Outlanders, except there are now only a small number of technologically adept superhuman barons instead of the hundreds of lesser kingpins). Another notable group are the mutants- humanoid beings that have adapted and gained inhuman powers, psionic and otherwise, due to radiation exposure and natural selection. There are a few notable villains in this list, which include:\n\n\nThe series had begun as a joint project by Christopher Lowder (pen name \"Jack Adrian\") and Laurence James (pen name \"James Axler\"), with the first book called \"Pilgrimage To Hell\". Laurence James then solely wrote the Deathlands series up to and including \"Eclipse at Noon\". However, due to failing health he was forced to leave the series in 1995. Prior to his death in February 2000, James wrote one last novel, \"Crucible of Time\", which was released in 1998. All other Deathlands novels have been written by a number of other authors, including Mark Ellis who produced the first post-Laurence James entry, \"Stoneface\". Gold Eagle is owned by Harlequin. In 2014, Harlequin was purchased by HarperCollins. It was decided that Gold Eagle would be shut down. After December 2015, Deathlands novels stopped being produced following the company's closure, with the rights transferred to Graphic Audio and all subsequent sequels being in an exclusive audio drama format. Below is a list of the books in the Deathlands series.\n\nGold Eagle novels\nPost-shutdown titles (audiobook exclusives)\n\nFollowing the closure of Gold Eagle Publishing in 2015, Graphic Audio, the primary provider of audiobook adaptations of the Deathlands franchise, acquired the rights to produce more content for the series. All titles produced in-house by Graphic Audio are exclusively in a narrated audio drama format.\n\n\"Deathlands\" also made it to film in 2003 as a low-budget telefilm that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. \"\" starred Vincent Spano and Traci Lords. Ryan, Krysty, J.B., and Jak were featured characters in the movie. Cannies, Sec Men, War Wag, and a Redoubt were depicted in the movie. The characters of Doc Tanner and Lori Quint were absent.\n\nMany of the \"Deathlands\" and \"Outlanders\" novels have been adapted to the Graphic Audio audio book format. The Deathands Saga was initially produced by Random House Audio, though the Saga was never completed. Currently these titles are produced by The Cutting Corporation and are called Graphic Audio. They are primarily targeted at long-distance drivers. With an average running time of nearly 8 hours, each of the books is a definite favorite of many OTR (over-the-road) truck drivers. The Cutting Corporation sets the \"Deathlands\" and \"Outlanders\" audio books apart from others by using a multicast. Each character has their own voice, and so makes it easy to picture the events from the book actually taking place. Music and background sound effects also accompany the sound track, setting their productions apart from most normal audio-books. The \"Deathlands\" Graphic Audio series currently has plans to continue the series after the events of the books end, the first completely original story releasing in Fall 2016.\n\nCreated in 1996 by Mark Ellis, \"Outlanders\" is the official spin-off series from \"Deathlands\", although it established an identity distinct from Deathlands with the first novel, \"Exile To Hell\". Outlanders provided a more expansive and complete backstory for the \"Axlerverse\" and the causes for the nuclear holocaust rather than relying on the \"US vs. USSR\" template.\n\n"}
