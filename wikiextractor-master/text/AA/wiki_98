In January 2016, Ferrari officially split off from its former parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nEnzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena. The Scuderia bought, prepared and fielded racing cars for gentleman drivers. It rapidly became a technical-racing outpost of Alfa Romeo and effectively took over as its official racing department in 1933 when Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team. \nThe Scuderia was then supplied with Alfa Romeo P3 \"monopostos\" and fielded many famous drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. The Ferrari's \"monopostos\" were now sporting the Prancing Horse shield on the engine cover. In 1935 the Ferrari's workshop designed and built its first race car, the Alfa Romeo Bimotore, taking the first steps on the route to become a car manufacturer. Moreover, during 1937 the first examples of Alfetta 158 were assembled in Modena under Enzo Ferrari's supervision. In 1938 Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again in-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milano and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department. At the same time the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded.\n\nOn September 6, 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision that he won't use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years. A few days later he founded \"Auto Avio Costruzioni\", headquartered in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari in Modena. The new company ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft parts but in 1940 Ferrari did in fact build two examples of a race car – the Auto Avio Costruzioni 815, based on a Fiat 508C platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia, but due to World War II it saw little competition. In 1943 the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. During the war the company's focus was mostly on fabricating grinding machines which were copies of original German tooling machines. The factory was bombed by the Allies between 1944 and 1945, but it was quickly rebuilt. In late 1945, after the war ended, Ferrari commissioned Gioacchino Colombo the design of a new V12 engine. In December 1946 Ferrari released to the press the specifications and drawings of his new car.\n\nThe first Ferrari-badged car was the 1947 125 Sport, powered by a 1.5 L V12 engine. On March 12, Enzo Ferrari took the car out for its first test-drive on the open roads. Two examples debuted on May 11, 1947 at the Piacenza racing circuit, driven by Franco Cortese and Nino Farina. This was the first time a Ferrari-badged car was entered in a race.\nIn 1950, Ferrari fielded racing cars in the Monaco Grand Prix, the first World Championship event held there. José Froilán González won the first Grand Prix for Ferrari in 1951, and Alberto Ascari secured Ferrari's first World title in 1952, a task he would repeat the following season. In 1957 the company changed its name to \"Auto Costruzioni Ferrari\". The same year, the Dino marque was introduced.\n\nEnzo Ferrari's strong personality had served his company and racing team, \"Scuderia Ferrari\", well for decades. Internal tensions reached boiling point in November 1961. Long-time sales manager Girolamo Gardini had long chafed at the involvement of Enzo's wife, Laura, in the company. The two frequently argued, and their dispute became a crisis for the company when Gardini, together with manager Romolo Tavoni, chief engineer Carlo Chiti, experimental sports car development chief Giotto Bizzarrini, made an ultimatum to Ferrari, demanding the removal of his wife from the company in a letter.\n\nAs a result, Ferrari called a meeting where Gardini, Tavoni, Chiti, Bizzarrini and a number of others who stood by them were ousted. All were tremendous losses to the company, and many thought this might be the end of Ferrari. Indeed, the defectors immediately formed a new company, ATS, to directly compete with Ferrari on the street and the track, and took with them \"Scuderia Serenissima\", one of Ferrari's best racing customers.\n\nThis \"great walkout\" came at an especially difficult time for Ferrari. At the urging of Chiti, the company was developing a new 250-based model to defend its honor against the Jaguar E-Type. Development of this car, the 250 GTO, was at a critical point, with the chassis development and styling left incomplete. Even if the car could be finished, it was unclear if it could be raced successfully without Tavoni and his lieutenants.\n\nInto this void stepped young engineer Mauro Forghieri and long-time racing bodyman Sergio Scaglietti. Forghieri successfully honed the GTO's handling and Scaglietti designed an all-new body for the car. The GTO went to Sebring with driver Phil Hill and placed first in class. It continued winning through 1962, brushing aside the challenge from Jaguar and becoming one of the most famous sports cars in history.\n\nThis shakeup, and Forghieri's engineering talent, made the 1960s even more successful for Ferrari than the previous decade. The mid-engined Dino racers laid the foundation for Forghieri's dominant 250-powered 250 P. On the street, the Dino road cars sold strongly, and legendary models like the 275 and Daytona were on the way.\n\nThe big V8-powered Shelby Cobra challenged the Ferraris in the early 1960s. By mid the 1960s, Ford tried to buy Ferrari but no agreement was reached. Instead, the Ford GT40 ended the dominance of Ferrari Prototypes at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966 when GT-40 Mark IIs finished 1-2-3. Dominated Le Mans again in 1967 in the Mark IV.\n\nAfter the performance of the big V8-powered Ford at the 1967 Le Mans, the FIA banned prototypes over 3000cc, which also affected the 330Ps. The change was announced in late 1967 and came in effect for 1968; for that season, the \"Scuderia\" did not take part in sports car racing in protest.\n\nThese years saw a new challenger. Formerly competing with smaller cars only, the Germans entered the new 3 litre sports car prototype class in 1968 with the Porsche 908, while Ferrari raced the Ferrari 312P in only few events in 1969. In March, the presentation of the 5 litre Porsche 917, built in advance in 25 exemplars, had surprised also Ferrari, which answered later that year with the production of 25 Ferrari 512S, funded from the money gained by the FIAT deal. At that time, Porsche had almost a full season of experience with their new car, and took the World Sportscar Championship where Ferrari was only 4th.\n\nThe 1970 season saw epic battles between the two teams and the many cars they entered, yet Porsche won every event except Sebring, where the victorious car and its drivers Ignazio Giunti/Nino Vaccarella/Mario Andretti had their origins in Italy. Ferrari decided to give up the 512 in 1971 in order to prepare the new 312PB for the 1972 season, when only 3 litre class would be allowed. In addition to Porsche, the old national rival with its Alfa Romeo T33/3 also had won two races in 1971, and thus was ranked second in the World Championship, above Ferrari.\n\nEarly in 1969, Fiat S.p.A. took a 50% stake in Ferrari. An immediate result was an increase in available investment funds, and work started at once on a factory extension intended to transfer production from Fiat's Turin plant of the Ferrari engined Fiat Dino. New model investment further up in the Ferrari range also received a boost.\n\nLess positive was the effect on industrial relations at Ferrari's Maranello plant. In June a visiting journalist witnessed a group of workers suddenly running out of a workshop in response to the blast of a whistle: this was part of an industrial stoppage originating at the main Fiat plant in Turin, and contrasted with the relatively smooth state of production that the writer had witnessed at competitor plants nearby.\n\nWhile increased Fiat influence was quickly felt in the development, production and marketing of road cars, the racing department remained initially little touched by Fiat's new status within the company as chief investor.\n\nThe 312PB dominated the World Sportscar Championship in 1972 against a rival Alfa Romeo, as the Porsche factory did not compete after the rule changes, and Matra focused on Le Mans only. In their home race, the French won, as Ferrari did not enter in 1972 due insufficient reliability over 24 hours, in order not to blemish their otherwise perfect record in that season.\n\nIn 1973, though, the Matra team also challenged for the championship which Ferrari eventually lost with two wins, compared to Matra's five, while Alfa Romeo had not entered that year. In addition, Ferrari was now forced to race also at Le Mans, despite concerns that even the modified engine would not last. Yet, one car survived and scored an unexpected and honourable 2nd place.\n\nFerrari then retired from Sports car racing to focus on the railing F1 effort.\n\nFerrari enjoyed a successful spell in Formula 1 in the 1970s, with Niki Lauda winning the World Championship in 1975 and 1977, and Jody Scheckter in 1979. In the 1980s, however, the team entered a period of crisis, culminating with the death of Gilles Villeneuve in Belgium in 1982 and a nearly-fatal accident for Didier Pironi in Germany the very same year.\n\nEnzo Ferrari died in 1988, at the age of 90. The last new model he commissioned was the specialist F40. Fiat increased its stake in Ferrari to 90% after buying the shares of its founder. Former Sporting Director Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was appointed President in 1991.\n\nThe hiring of Jean Todt as Sporting director in 1993 and Michael Schumacher in 1996 triggered a comeback of the F1 team, with three wins in 1996, and close yet eventually losing challenges to the driver's championship in the years 1997 to 1999.\n\nIn an unprecedented and record-setting fashion, Schumacher and Ferrari dominated F1 winning the World Driver's championship from 2000 through 2004 and the Constructors' Championship from 1999 through 2004.\n\nIn June 2002 Fiat sold 34% of Ferrari to a Mediobanca-led consortium of banks for €775.2 million. The consortium comprised Commerzbank (who got a 10% stake for €228 million), Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (1.5%) and Compagnie Monégasque de Banque (1%). Mediobanca retained a 21.5% stake.\nIn July 2005 Mediobanca sold 5% of Ferrari to Mubadala Development Company, an investment company wholly owned by the Government of Abu Dhabi. The deal saw Mubadala pay €114 million to purchase the five percent stake.\n\nIn October 2006 Fiat bought back the 29% stake still owned by the consortium, paying €892 million. At the time of the transaction, Mediobanca owned an 11.7% stake, Commerzbank the 8.5%, ABN AMRO the 7,5% and Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna the 1,3%.\n\nIn November 2010 Fiat paid €122 million to buy back the last 5% stake owned by Mubadala Development. With this transaction, Fiat's stake in the luxury Italian car maker returned to 90%.\n\nIn October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its intentions to separate Ferrari from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.\n\nThe separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established \"Ferrari N.V.\" as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of a 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Through the remainings steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with a 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.\n\nOn January 3, 2016, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Ferrari N.V. announced the completion of separation of the Ferrari business from the FCA group on the same day, with trading on the Mercato Telematico Azionario set to begin on January 4, 2016, under the RACE ticker symbol and the ISIN code NL0011585146.\n\nFerrari celebrated the 70th anniversary of its foundation in 2017.\n\nFerrari celebrated the 90th anniversary of its Scuderia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1911382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911382", "title": "Yamaha XS 650", "text": "Yamaha XS 650\n\nThe Yamaha XS650 is a mid-size motorcycle made by Yamaha Motor Company. The standard model was introduced in October 1969,and produced through 1979. The \"Special\" cruiser model was introduced in 1978 and produced through 1985. The XS650 began with the 1955 Hosk SOHC 500 twin. After about 10 years of producing 500 twin, Hosk engineers designed a 650 cc twin. Later the Hosk company was acquired by Showa Corporation, and in 1960 Yamaha had bought Showa with Hosk's early design of 650 cc twin. \n\nWhen the Yamaha XS 650 was launched in October 1969 it had one of the most advanced engines in its class of large parallel twin motorcycles. The engine and gearbox are unit construction with the crankcase split horizontally for ease of assembly whereas almost all contemporaries in its class in 1969 are either unit construction with a vertically split crankcase or pre-unit construction with separate engine and gearbox. The XS650's engine was used in AMA Professional Dirt Track Racing by national champion Kenny Roberts. In 1969 only the Laverda 750S, and the Honda CB350, also launched that year, matched the XS 650's modernity of unit construction and SOHC valve operation.\n\nThe 1970 model was designated the XS-1. Subsequent Yamaha Xs650 models were XS-1B (1971), XS-2 (1972), then TX650/XS2B (1973), TX650-A (1974), XS650B (1975), XS650C (1976), XS-D (1977), XS-E (1978), XS-F (1979). 1979 was the last year of the so-called \"Standards\" (an unofficial term commonly used to differentiate it from the \"Special,\" which has pullback bars, a teardrop tank, and other differences in appearance). The Es and Fs also came in Special form: XS-SE (S for Special) and XS-SF. From then on they were Specials only to XS-SG, XS-SH, XS-SJ, XS-SK. There was a Special II (Two) model designation in 1978 (unknown) in 1979 (XS-SF-II), 1980 (XS-G), 1981 (XS-H) which were models with fewer chrome parts decals instead of plated plastic on the side covers as well as drum rear brake and wire wheels versus disc rear brake or cast wheels. The Special II was offered until 1985, the last year for the XS 650.\n\nThe first two model years (XS-1 and XS-1B) were kick start only, with an electric starter added from the 1972 model year on. This had a compression release added to the front left exhaust tappet cover resulting in a square versus triangular cover found on the other exhaust and intake covers. Upon removal of the compression release mechanism in 1974 due to updated starter, the square cover at the left exhaust valve was continued.\n\nBrake modification notes:\n\nHandling differences on swapping rear wheels:-\n\nPrior to the XS-B model, the bike had a reputation for speed wobbles but adjustments to the 1975 setup overcame these.\n\n1976 models had the front brake caliper moved to the right fork leg, behind the fork as opposed to in front of the fork. This placed the brake caliper nearer the steering pivot center-line, requiring slightly less effort to steer.\n\nMid-'77 the front forks had a major redesign: fork tube diameter increased from 34 to and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size). The entire fork assembly (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the brake caliper changed from a dual piston cast iron design for the fork to a aluminum single piston floating caliper for the forks. The brake caliper mounting lugs on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the and forks so the calipers can't be swapped.\n\nThe XS 650 was produced until 1985. The last model year was 1983 in the United States, with Canada, Europe and other markets continuing into 1984 and 1985. However, many US models remained unsold for some years due to overproduction and an economic recession and brand new 1982 and 1983 models could still be purchased in 1987 at some dealerships.\n\nLike the contemporaries in its class the XS 650 has a 360° crank angle. This provides an even firing interval between the two cylinders, but also generates some vibration caused by the two pistons rising and falling together. This vibration is particularly noticeable at idle. Because of a long-acknowledged vibration issue, starting with the 1974 models, vibration damping modifications were made to the engine and handlebar mountings. \n\nThe XS 650s valves are operated by a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) whereas almost all contemporaries in its class have pushrod valvegear .\n\nThe 360 degrees crankshaft uses three roller bearings and a ball bearing. The camshaft uses four ball bearings, and rolling bearings are used throughout the rest of the engine. Connecting rods turn on needle bearings. Since the engine is SOHC, there are no pushrods to operate the valves. The camshaft gets its drive from a single-row chain running from the center of the crankshaft. Chain tension is maintained by a spring-loaded guide, which also takes up unnecessary slack. The initial intake valve timing was changed in 1973 (EPA mandated) from a longer duration to a milder duration, this and other changes stifled the later models somewhat, the compression ratio also became lower over the years to match the milder cam timing, the flywheel is lighter than British contemporaries, this has the effect that the engine tends to pick up revs more rapidly when the throttle is opened quickly.\n\nDuring the later developments of the engine compression ratios were lowered, then raised. Pistons were lightened 20 percent along with connecting rods to reduce the reciprocating mass inside the engine. Aluminum pistons are slightly domed with valve pockets. Pistons have three rings installed, two compression and one oil control ring.\n\nHorizontal split of the crankcases offers the advantages of oil tightness through the elimination of vertical joints and one-step access to both the lower end and the gearbox. Oil pressure is provided by the trochoidal pump, driven by a steel spur gear off the crankshaft. The main bearings, transmission main shaft, clutch bushing, shifter fork guide bar, and rocker arms are lubricated by pressurized oil, whereas the rest of the engine is lubricated by “oil splash, this includes the big ends .”\n\nPre-1980 models use the twin constant velocity Mikuni carburetors that can be tuned by moving the needle clip position, or by replacing jets. In the carburetors the velocity of the fuel mixture through the venturi, regulated by the opening of the butterfly valves and engine speed, causes a pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the carburetor pistons. This pressure difference raises and lowers the carburetor slides, increasing or decreasing engine output accordingly.\n\nPost-1979 models use smaller Mikuni CV carbs with needles that seem to be listed in parts menus as being 'fixed' position,(in other words a needle that may only have one clip position). The pilot and main jets can be changed for different sizes. If the CV carb needles only have one fixed clip position.\n\nThe models up to 1979 use points ignition. Two sets of points are located on the upper left of the cylinder head. On the right side cylinder head, an advance mechanism is located. An advance mechanism is used to retard the timing for easy starting and smooth idle. Post-1979 models use electronic ignition systems. \n\n\"Cycle World\" tested the XS650 in March 1979. It ran the standing-start quarter mile 13.86 seconds with a terminal speed of . The motorcycle's average fuel economy was \n\n"}

{"id": "1911413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911413", "title": "Fatherland Party (Norway)", "text": "Fatherland Party (Norway)\n\nThe Fatherland Party (, FLP) was a political party in Norway, which was founded by former local Progress Party politician Harald Trefall in 1990. Primarily based in Western Norway, the party supported nationalist positions such as opposition to immigration and the European Union. It got two representatives elected to public office in the 1991 local elections, in a county and municipal council respectively. The party never won representation since, and was dissolved in 2008 after years of electoral inactivity.\n\nThe FLP was founded on 17 May 1990 by Harald Trefall, a member of \"Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring\" (FMI) and former Bergen city councillor for the Progress Party. He became noted in the late 1980s for his opposition to immigration, and was the first candidate for the Stop Immigration party in Hordaland in 1989. In one of the earliest notable acts by the party, it put an ad in the Christian newspaper \"Dagen\", where it called for Christians to fight together with the party to stop Norway from becoming \"a Muslim country\". In its first election, the 1991 local elections, it won one representative in the Karmøy municipal council, and one representative in the Hordaland county council. The party won 0.5% of the vote in the 1993 parliamentary election, and combined with Stop Immigration more than 15,000 votes. Trefall stepped down as leader of the party in 1994 after \"six years of resistance struggle against immigration,\" although he would remain chairman of the party's so-called Council.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino, it was revealed that Øystein Hedstrøm, Member of Parliament and Spokesperson on Immigration Issues for the Progress Party, had held long-term contacts with the FLP. There had also allegedly been talks of a joint list between the parties for the upcoming election, talks which nevertheless never went through. When opinion polls had shown that the FLP could win one or two local seats in Bergen, local politicians from all the other represented parties in the city (except the Progress Party) issued a public \"warning\" against the party. In the 1995 local elections, the FLP failed to defend its elected representatives, nor to win any new ones. In Oslo, the party cooperated with the Stop Immigration party in the \"Fellesliste mot fremmedinnvandring\", to no success. When it was revealed that Jack Erik Kjuus succeeded his Stop Immigration party with the White Electoral Alliance and introduced a far more radical program, the FLP immediately distanced itself from the new program and broke all cooperation with Kjuus and his group. From 1997 to 1999, the FLP was part of the Nordic NordNat organisation, which included the Sweden Democrats.\n\nIn the 1997 parliamentary election, the party was reduced to 0.1% of the national vote, and was even more marginalised in the 1999 local elections. It gained competition from the new Norwegian People's Party (NFP) for the 2001 parliamentary election, which left its support split between the two parties. The NFP had planned to merge with the FLP the year before, but according to the former party's leader Oddbjørn Jonstad, Trefall had made organisational demands he refused to agree on. The FLP did not contest the 2005 parliamentary election, while many of its members, including its deputy chairman, rather ran for the Democrats.\n\nThe FLP was a self-described nationalist party, that wanted to \"preserve the national interests of Norway, and defend and develop the Christian heritage (by a democratic foundation).\" The party wanted Norway to remain a Norwegian nation-state, and opposed membership of the European Union as well as mass immigration, claiming both to be unconstitutional. The party also claimed that the \"forced introduction\" of a multicultural society was a violation of the human rights of the Norwegian people in terms with the international conventions of the United Nations. The party sought a global community of independent people in their own native countries, claiming a world community of independent nations to be \"the best foundation for world peace.\" The party also wanted to strengthen the family, improve conditions for the elderly, keep a strong defence and law and order.\n\nWhile the party was accused by some of being \"neo-Nazi\" and \"racist\", many of its members where in fact former members of the Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. They included Erik Gjems-Onstad who was part of \"Kompani Linge\", and Oslo candidates Jan Høeg who was part of Milorg and Arvid Austad who participated in the execution squads against convicted Nazi traitors (including Vidkun Quisling) in the legal purge after the war. Austad expanded on his position in 1999, by stating that he saw \"clear parallels\" between the Nazi invasion of Norway and \"today's great immigration of Muslims.\"\n\nIn school elections the party generally had a greater approval rating than in ordinary ones, with its strongest county-wide result in Sogn og Fjordane in 1995 when it got 6.2% of the votes. The best country-wide school election was in 1993 when it won 2.5% of the national vote. In the 1991 school elections the party received up to 30% of the votes in certain vocational upper secondary schools in Rogaland. In 1993, it received 41% of the vote at an upper secondary school in Valdres.\n\n\n"}

Computer-aided design also known as CAD was originally the type of program that architects used, but since CAD could not offer all the tools that architects needed to complete a project, CAAD developed as a distinct class of software.\n\nAll CAD and CAAD systems employ a database with geometric and other properties of objects; they all have some kind of graphic user interface to manipulate a visual representation rather than the database; and they are all more or less concerned with assembling designs from standard and non-standard pieces. Currently, the main distinction which causes one to speak of CAAD rather than CAD lies in the domain knowledge (architecture-specific objects, techniques, data, and process support) embedded in the system. A CAAD system differs from other CAD systems in two respects:\n\nIn a more general sense, CAAD also refers to the use of any computational technique in the field of architectural design other than by means of architecture-specific software. For example, software which is specifically developed for the computer animation industry (e.g. Maya and 3DStudio Max), is also used in architectural design. These programs can produce photo realistic 3d renders and animations. Nowadays real-time rendering is being popular thanks to the developments in graphic cards. The exact distinction of what properly belongs to CAAD is not always clear. Specialized software, for example for calculating structures by means of the finite element method, is used in architectural design and in that sense may fall under CAAD. On the other hand, such software is seldom used to create new designs.\n\nIn 1974 Caad became a current word and was a common topic of commercial modernization.\n\nCAAD has two types of structures in its program. The first system is surface structure which provides a graphics medium to represent three-dimensional objects using two-dimensional representations. Also algorithms that allow the generation of patterns and their analysis using programmed criteria, and data banks that store information about the problem at hand and the standards and regulations that applies to it. The second system is deep structure which means that the operations performed by the computer have natural limitations. Computer hardware and machine languages that are supported by these make it easy to perform arithmetical operations quickly and accurately. Also an almost illogical number of layers of symbolic processing can be built enabling the functionalities that are found at the surface.\n\nAnother advantage to CAAD is the two way mapping of activities and functionalities.NOS. The two instances of mapping are indicated to be between the surface structures (TM1) and the deep structures (TM2). These mappings are abstractions that are introduced in order to discuss the process of design and deployment of CAAD systems. In designing the systems the system developers usually consider TM1. Here a one-to-one mapping is the typical statement, which is to develop a computer based functionality that maps as closely as possible into a corresponding manual design activity, for example, drafting of stairs, checking spatial conflict between building systems, and generating perspectives from orthogonal views.\nThe architectural design processes tend to integrate models isolated so far. Many different kinds of expert knowledge, tools, visualization techniques, and media are to be combined. The design process covers the complete life cycle of the building. The areas that are covered are construction, operations, reorganization, as well as destruction. Considering the shared use of digital design tools and the exchange of information and knowledge between designers and across different projects, we speak of a design continuum.\n\nAn architect's work involves mostly visually represented data. Problems are often outlined and dealt with in a graphical approach. Only this form of expression serves as a basis for work and discussion. Therefore, the designer should have maximum visual control over the processes taking place within the design continuum. Further questions occur about navigation, associative information access, programming and communication within very large data sets. \n\n\nSeveral organisations are active in education and research in CAAD:\n"}

Bruno Taut's best-known building, the prismatic dome of the Glass Pavilion of which only black and white images survive today, was in reality a brightly colored landmark. Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer designed a model factory for the exhibition. The Belgian architect Henri van de Velde designed a model theatre. Berlin-based Margarete Knuppelholz-Roeser designed the controversial Haus Der Frau.\n\nThe exhibition happened mainly on the initiative of the later German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, then a 36-year-old aspiring inventor, Werkbund member and local politician at Cologne. The city spent the luxurious sum of 5 million Goldmarks (equivalent to million €) on the event. Planning began in earnest in 1912, and construction work started in early 1914. The exhibition was opened to the public by Van de Velde on May 15th, 1914. Scheduled to last until the end of October, it was prematurely shut down on August 8th, in reaction to the outbreak of World War I a week earlier; the exhibition buildings were dismantled shortly afterwards.\n\nThere were two more Werkbund Exhibitions after the war. The second was the Stuttgart Exhibition of 1927, which included the Weissenhof Estate. At that time, the third Werkbund Exhibition had been tentatively scheduled for 1937, but the plan was shelved in 1932 because of the Great Depression and could not be taken up again since the Nazis opposed and ultimately outlawed the Werkbund. It finally took place on a reduced scale in 1949, back in Cologne, and turned out to be the last Werkbund Exhibition.\n\n"}

{"id": "1911454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911454", "title": "Urban debate league", "text": "Urban debate league\n\nAn urban debate league (UDL) is a group of high school policy debate teams from urban high schools in the United States. UDLs are generally located in large cities throughout the United States and work predominantly with minority students.\n\nThere were various initiatives surrounding debate in urban areas in the early 1980s in Atlanta, Detroit, and Philadelphia.\n\nThe 1960s saw a rapid expansion of interscholastic forensics - competitive speech and debate. Rapid growth by the National Forensic League and the forensic community as a whole was matched by a growing number of metropolitan leagues intended to increase tournament opportunities in areas where a number of speech and debate programs existed. The Philadelphia Senior High School Debate League was started in the School District in the mid-1960s. By 1965, a large Metro Forensic League which included speech, theater, and debate competition developed in Nashville, Tennessee. Many of those programs simply merged into the overall forensics community, but some continued to flourish as specialized, localized communities. By the early 1980s, approximately 30 Philadelphia teams were meeting once a week after school at Olney High School doing Policy Debate. The league became the Philadelphia Scholastic Debate League in 2007 with the support of the After School Activities Partnerships (ASAP) and switched to Public Forum debate in 2008.\n\nIn the 1980s, the face of high school debate began to change. A growing awareness of the unequal access to debate spurred some individuals to focus on the need to expand access to disadvantaged groups in urban areas. Traditionally left out by financial constraints, many inner-city school students were completely excluded. The Detroit Public Debate League began in 1984 as an after-school partnership between the Detroit Gifted and Talented Program and Wayne State University Director of Debate George Ziegelmueller. While developed as a \"gifted\" program, it was open to all Detroit communities and brought many socio-economically disadvantaged students into the activity. In Atlanta, the Urban Debate League was born as a graduate school research paper in 1983 that explored the hypothesis that debate might be a tool to level the playing field in education, and that words might be used to reduce violence in America’s cities. The initial Atlanta UDL was formed as a partnership between the Barkley Forum of Emory University and the Atlanta Public Schools. The concept took root and flourished, and by 1985, it was a fully established league.\n\nEarly program support for urban debate initiatives was granted through the National Forensic League and Phillips Petroleum by the early 1990s. Significant seed funding was then provided by the Open Society Institute (OSI) in the Spring of 1997 to take the initiative national, and OSI chose the Atlanta Urban Debate League model as the template to model in other cities. As a result, Atlanta has traditionally been thought to be the basis for the urban debate network. By 2010, more than 40,000 urban public school students had competed in UDL tournaments, coming from over 400 high schools. The once predominantly white, suburban activity has changed to more accurately reflect American society. And the tireless efforts of the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues, the Associated Leaders of Urban Debate, and the National Debate Project continue to promote, support, and assess this important educational reform movement.\n\nThe most crucial component in making the Urban Debate League a national education reform movement was seed funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. In the spring of 1997, OSI launched its High School Debate Grantmaking Program, the purpose of which was to support initiatives that seek to institutionalize competitive debate opportunities in high schools in traditionally underserved communities. OSI already had a tradition of supporting high school debate through its network of foundations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where OSI had demonstrated that participation in debate fostered the skills that empower young people to actively participate as citizens of open society.\n\nAfter the successful establishment at a successful Urban Debate League in New York City based on the Atlanta model, OSI continued its support for the Atlanta and New York City leagues. By 2000, OSI had provided seed and support funding for leagues in Detroit, Tuscaloosa, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, the San Francisco Bay area, Baltimore, Providence, and Southern California. Before ending the program, they had provided funding for the establishment of UDLs, adding Los Angeles, and Newark. All of those leagues are still operating in 2010, and continue to serve students and provide educational opportunities that would otherwise not exist. That continued operation shows that the OSI initiative has been a great success in creating a program that would be able to gain public and private support in order to continue even when the initial OSI grants ended.\n\nThe contributions of OSI and other funders has led multiple other donors to bring to fruition Urban Debate Leagues in their own cities. For instance, Friends of the Miami Dade Urban Debate League—a group of individuals, corporations, and foundations—established an Urban Debate League in Miami in 2005. In 2006, a league formed in Boston. Since that time, it has received support from The Boston Public Schools, the Boston Foundation, The Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family Foundation, Social Venture Partners, Edvestors, The Mentor Network, The Harbus Foundation, the GMA Foundation, and the A.C. Ratshesky Foundation. Also, the Einhorn Charitable Trust provided funding to found a UDL in Milwaukee in 2006. As of October 2008, the Milwaukee program is no longer administered through or associated with Marquette University. In 2007, the Dallas Urban Debate Alliance brought debate to the Dallas Independent School District. In 2008, a group of former high school and college debaters founded the Houston Urban Debate League to bring debate to at risk students in Houston. The Houston Independent School Board partnered with that group to support the start up of a 15 school league for the 2008-2009 school year. Also in 2008, a former parochial high school debater with the assistance of the NAUDL formed the Memphis Urban Debate League Advisory Board and partnered with Memphis City Schools to establish a 15 school league for the 2008-2009 school year (www.memphisdebate.org). The Community Education Initiative is leading an effort to establish a new UDL in Nashville for the 2010-2011 school year. The league being formed represents a collaboration between the Community Education Initiative, the Metro Nashville Public Schools, the Metro Forensic League, the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues, and the National Debate Project. All over the country, funders, universities, and individuals who are called to make a difference in their communities are partnering to bring the benefits of debate to disenfranchised youth.\n\nin 2015, a new Urban Debate League was formed in Washington D.C. (WUDL) to further expand the network.\n\nWith the growth of Urban Debate Leagues across the country, there are several national entities that are committed to reaching as many students as possible with the power of debate. In 2002 the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues was created to provide national leadership of the Urban Debate Network.\n\nThe National Debate Project (NDP)—a consortium of Emory University, Georgia State University, Tennessee State University, Clark Atlanta University, and New York University—works in the field of education reform, and promotes debate as a tool for empowering urban and rural youth living in America’s most socio-economically challenged communities. In 2003 urban debate moved into national prominence with an article in \"U.S. News & World Report\" and a feature story on \"60 Minutes\" about the Baltimore Urban Debate League. The sudden attention and the reduction of OSI support led to the formation of the National Debate Project in Atlanta and domestic activities by the International Debate Education Association (IDEA). At about this time Urban Debate Leagues began to develop their connections with the growing after-school programs movement: in 2004 and 2005 the NAUDL was invited to make presentations at the National Institute for Out of School Time and the Alliance for Excellent Education annual conferences.\n\nIn 2005, the Associated Leaders of Urban Debate (ALOUD) was formed, led by New York University (NYU) President John Sexton and Pitney Bowes CEO Michael Critelli.\n\nMajor press coverage of the Urban Debate League movement and NDP projects has been featured in the \"New York Times\", \"U.S. News and World Report\", \"Seattle Times\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"Baltimore Sun\", \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", \"Teacher Magazine\", \"Chronicle for Higher Education\", \"Christian Science Monitor\", the White House official website, and on CBS' \"60 Minutes\".\n\nThe goal of the OSI's Urban Debate Program was to offer initial support to fund debate programs within urban communities, develop local stakeholders (e.g., university partners, community funders and school system support) and then to exit the equation. The concept was once local actors see the value of the program, sustaining investment in debate would become easier. Today, Urban Debate Leagues are funded primarily by one of three local institutions: urban public school systems, non-profit organizations dedicated to establishing a local UDL, or university debate programs engaged in community outreach.\n\nMost UDLs function in their own unique way, and use different teaching methods to familiarize urban students with the format and application of policy debate. Most urban debate leagues recruit and train urban educators as coaches, though many also use university debaters or former debaters within the community to serve as assistant coaches. While all UDLs attempt to recruit volunteer support (e.g., tournament judges, tournament tab room coordinators, and lecturers at debate workshops for students), certain core costs of a UDL must be funded in order for the program to be sustainable including coach stipends, debate materials, and transportation to tournaments.\n\nLocal debate programs have spawned other methods to integrate debate into their communities. Urban debate has expanded to include debate across the curriculum (as a classroom learning tool), public debates (partnering with community-based organizations), debates in prisons, and middle school competitions.\n\nUDLs have demonstrated a very high level of cost-effectiveness, averaging less than $650 per student for a year's involvement in a program that researchers and media observers have widely recognized as unusually intensive in its academic focus, relative to other after-school programs.\n\n"}

The party's political goal is to empower citizens to govern themselves by converting the provincial government into a republic with an upper house made up of citizen selected at random and based on merit. The party was formed in 2001 by Andrew Hokhold, a dentist and inventor living in the Vernon/Armstrong area. Hokhold was the party's only candidate in the 2001 election, coming in last place in the Okanagan-Vernon riding. Two candidates, Hokhold and White Rock resident Tibor Tusnady, ran in the 2005 election, both coming in last place, in the Shuswap and Okanagan-Vernon riding, respectively. While the party has only nominated three candidates over the course of three elections, it has accumulated assets worth over a million dollars.\n\nThe party's goal is to empower citizens to govern themselves. To that end, their objective is to restructure the provincial government. The party advocates for a republican form of government with an upper house (like a senate) consisting of random and merit-based selections of citizens. This upper house would be given more power than the lower Legislative Assembly to pass legislation and run the government. Party founder Andrew Hokhold stated that the existing electoral system is systemically biased in favour of individuals with \"big egos\" while \"more passive people — who represent the majority — get crushed by the campaign process or simply refuse to run for office\".\n\nIn both the 2001 and 2005 elections the only expenditures by candidates reported to Elections BC were the $100 nomination deposit. The party claimed $5 in expenditures during the 2001 election and no expenses during the 2005 election. Regardless of the low expenditures on elections, the party had accumulated over a million dollars in assets.\n\nIn the 2001 provincial election the party consisted of four members and only had one candidate, Hokhold who stood in the Okanagan-Vernon riding. Hokhold came in last place in the riding with 82 votes (0.33%), losing to BC Liberal Party candidate Tom Christensen.\n\nIn the 2005 provincial election, the party nominated candidates in two ridings. Andrew Hokhold stood in the Shuswap riding but got only 42 votes (0.18%), coming in last place, losing to BC Liberal George Abbott. In Okanagan-Vernon, the BC Patriot Party candidate was Tibor Lesley Tusnady, who was also the party leader and a White Rock resident.

This would provide a continuously navigable sea route around the Indian Peninsula. The channel would be dredged in the Sethusamudram sea between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, passing through the limestone shoals of Adam's Bridge (also known as Rama's Bridge, Ram Sethu and Ramar Palam (Tamil: இராமர் பாலம் Rāmar pālam)).\n\nThe project involves digging a long deepwater channel linking the shallow Palk Strait with the Gulf of Mannar. Conceived in 1860 by Alfred Dundas Taylor, it recently received approval of the Indian government.\n\nThe proposed route through the shoals of Adam's Bridge is opposed by some groups on religious, environmental and economical grounds. Five alternative routes were considered that avoid damage to the shoals. The most recent plan is to dig the channel roughly in the middle of the straits to provide the shortest course and the course requiring least maintenance. This plan avoids the demolition of Ram Setu.\n\nBecause of its shallow waters, Sethusamudramthe sea separating Sri Lanka from Indiapresents a hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait. Though trade across the India-Sri Lanka divide has been active since at least the first millennium BCE, it has been limited to small boats and dinghies. Larger oceangoing vessels coming from the West have had to navigate around Sri Lanka to reach India' eastern coast. Eminent British geographer Major James Rennell surveyed the region in late 18th century; he suggested that a \"navigable passage could be maintained by dredging of the Ramisseram [sic]\". Little notice was given to his proposal, perhaps because it came from \"so young and an unknown officer\", and the idea was only revived 60 years later. Efforts were made in 1838 to dredge the canal, but the passage did not remain navigable for any vessels except those with a shallow draft.\n\nThe project was possibly conceived in 1860 by Commander A. D. Taylor of the Indian Marines, and has been reviewed many times without a decision being made. It has been part of the election manifestos of all political parties during elections. The Government of India appointed the Sethu Samudram Project Committee in 1955headed by Dr. A. Ramasamy Mudaliarwhich was charged with examining the desirability of the project. After evaluating the costs and benefits, this committee found the project feasible and viable. However it strongly recommended an overland passage instead of a channel cutting through Rama's Bridge. A land passage would have several advantages, such as avoiding shifting sandbanks and navigational hazards. Several reviews of the proposals followed until the United Progressive Alliance Government of India headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced the inauguration of the project on 2 July 2005.\n\nIn 2008, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appointed Rajendra K. Pachauri as the head of a six-member committee to look at an alternative alignment avoiding the sensitive Ramar Sethu stretch. In 2013, the committee released its report calling the project \"unviable both from the economic as well as ecological angles\". The Indian government rejected the committee's report and decided to go ahead with the project in its current form.<ref name=\"Singh/IndiaToday\"></ref>\n\nSome naval hydrographers and experts suggest that the project is unlikely to be financially viable or serve ships in any significant way. The time savings for ships sailing from Kanyakumari or Tuticorin is between 10 and 30 hours. Ships from destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Mauritius and Europe, would save an average of 8 hours using the canal. At the present tariff rates, ships from Africa and Europe will lose on every voyage because the savings in time for these ships are considerably lower than what is calculated in the DPR. This loss is significant because 65% of the canal's projected users are from Africa and Europe. If tariffs are lowered to a point where ships from Africa and Europe will not lose money from using the canal, the IRR of the project falls to 2.6%.<ref name=\"John/EPW\"></ref> This is a level at which even public infrastructure projects are rejected by the government.\n\nThe canal is designed for ships of 30,000 metric tonnes and lighter. Most new ships weighing more than 60,000 tonnes and tankers weighing above 150,000 tonnes cannot use this canal. \n\nAxis Bank Ltd. was appointed \"loan arranger\" for the project in 2005.Since its inception in 2004, costs have risen to at least , interest rates have risen and old loan terms have lapsed. The loan sanctions, valid only up to , lapsed. To secure more money, Sethusamudram Corp. Ltd would have to draw up new reports, sit with parliamentary committees and receive fresh approval. The project cost which originally were will grow by almost , a shipping ministry source said.\n\nThe project would disturb the ecological balance and destroy corals and kill marine life. The area is an important fishing ground for Tamil Nadu and the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park is in the vicinity of the proposed project. Opposition to the canal's planned route has come from local fishermen who are demanding alternative channels, which are available. They say the planned route would destroy marine life and corals and would impact the trade in conch shells that is worth almost a year. Deposits of thorium, important for nuclear fuel requirements, would also be affected. Opponents also say that the dumping of dredged material from the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar in deeper waters would \"endanger those areas, which are rich reserves containing 400 endangered species, including whales, sea turtles, dugongs and dolphins\".<ref name=\"Ramesh/Guardian\"></ref>\n\nTsunami expert Professor Tad Murtywho advised the Government of India on the tsunami warning systemhas said that the planned route may result in increased impact from tsunami waves. He wrote, \"During the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, the southern part of Kerala was generally spared from a major tsunami, mainly because the tsunami waves from Sumatra region travelling south of the Sri Lankan island, partially diffracted northward and affected the central part of the Kerala coast. Since the tsunami is a long gravity wave (similar to tides and storm surges) during the diffraction process, the rather wide turn it has to take spared the south Kerala coast. On the other hand, deepening the Sethu Canal might provide a more direct route for the tsunami and this could impact south Kerala.\" <ref name=\"Vijay/Rediff\"></ref>\n\nOn 21 April 2010, the Supreme Court of India decided to delay the project to until an Environmental impact analysis on the feasibility of a route through Dhanuskodi instead of Rama's Bridge had been carried out.\n\nOpposition to the project also came from certain Hindu groups that see 'Rama’s Bridge' as the remains of a bridge built by the King Lord Rama.<ref name=\"Mendis/SLG\"></ref>\n\n"}

Potter was initially depicted as a supervillain and one of the first enemies of the superhero Daredevil. In civilian life, he is a costume designer at the Spotlight Costume Shop in New York City. He eventually reforms and became one of the staunchest supporters of Daredevil.\n\nPotter was portrayed by Matt Gerald in the Marvel Netflix TV series \"Daredevil\" set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nGladiator first appeared in \"Daredevil\" #18 (July 1966), and was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.\n\nMelvin Potter was a costume designer who had the deluded belief that he was far better than any superhero. In order to prove his point, he designed a suit of battle armor for himself, complete with deadly wrist blades, and became known as the Gladiator. He battled Daredevil in his first criminal outing, and then met the Masked Marauder, another enemy of Daredevil's. Gladiator later appeared in Europe, where he fought Daredevil again, and was then invited to join the Maggia. He joined Electro's Emissaries of Evil to attack Daredevil again. Later, Gladiator aided Whitney Frost in a raid of Stark Enterprises, where he first fought Iron Man.\n\nGladiator later battled Daredevil again. Some time later, he fought Daredevil aboard an airplane in flight. He later allied with the Death-Stalker, and later still allied with the Beetle. While under control of the Purple Man, he attacked Daredevil. Gladiator had one last battle against Daredevil before deciding to reform. He began undergoing therapy from Betsy Beatty, whom he later married.\n\nNow reformed, the Gladiator later allied with Daredevil and Elektra against the Hand. Donning his Gladiator costume again, Potter met Spider-Man.\n\nPotter was pressured into producing a Daredevil costume for a madman in the employ of the crime lord known as the Kingpin, but Murdock comes to tell him to play along. Potter later donned his Gladiator costume again to discourage a youth from a life of crime.\n\nHe was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor Alexander Bont, who claimed that Potter had a four-year-old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help. Gladiator brought Murdock to Bont, who attempted to kill Murdock and assume his old mantle but instead died of a drug-induced heart attack. The Gladiator was defeated by the new White Tiger, and went back to prison.\n\nGladiator is accused of murdering two fellow inmates and Matt Murdock's law firm is defending him. Murdock's super-senses indicate that he is telling the truth when he claims he is innocent. However, at the end of the issue, taunted by another inmate, Gladiator snaps his handcuffs and brutally assaults the inmate and a corrections officer, only to surrender to another officer and claim once again that he didn't do it. Later, after being broken out of an armored car, Melvin beats a confused Daredevil and moves to the sewers, heading for his Gladiator costume. Gladiator then goes on a rampage in Chinatown killing innocent people and then attacking Matt and Milla in a restaurant. After being knocked out, Matt reawakens in a police car to hear a voice that Gladiator will murder his wife. Matt finds the Gladiator and Milla, rescues Milla, and defeats the Gladiator. Melvin realizes what he has done and attempts suicide, but is saved by Daredevil. Potter is taken back to prison, and is heavily sedated after repeatedly banging his head against the wall. It is revealed that Mr. Fear had secretly administered chemicals to Potter that caused him to go irreversibly insane with rage.\n\nGladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is a superb martial arts fighter and is very physically powerful. He wore a thick metal armor with a helmet and metallic gauntlets, and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling, jagged circular sawblades made of titanium, one mounted on each gauntlet. Small rotors in the gauntlets cause the blades to rotate at high speeds, and the whirling blades could also be detached to serve as short-range missile weapons.\n\nIn civilian life, Potter is an accomplished clothing designer, proficient in drafting, design and sewing.\n\nIn the alternate time of the 2005 \"House of M\" storyline, Gladiator appears as an assassin of the Kingpin.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel universe version of Gladiator is an enemy of Spider-Man, and a crazed madman obsessed with \"the emperor\".\n\n\n\n"}

A Lorentz scalar may be generated from e.g., the scalar product of vectors, or from contracting tensors of the theory. While the components of vectors and tensors are in general altered under Lorentz transformations, Lorentz scalars remain unchanged.\n\nA Lorentz scalar is not always immediately seen to be an invariant scalar in the mathematical sense, but the resulting scalar value is invariant under any basis transformation applied to the vector space, on which the considered theory is based. A simple Lorentz scalar in Minkowski spacetime is the \"spacetime distance\" (\"length\" of their difference) of two fixed events in spacetime. While the \"position\"-4-vectors of the events change between different inertial frames, their spacetime distance remains invariant under the corresponding Lorentz transformation. Other examples of Lorentz scalars are the \"length\" of 4-velocities (see below), or the Ricci curvature in a point in spacetime from General relativity, which is a contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor there.\n\nIn special relativity the location of a particle in 4-dimensional spacetime is given by \n\nwhere formula_2 is the position in 3-dimensional space of the particle, formula_3 is the velocity in 3-dimensional space and formula_4 is the speed of light.\n\nThe \"length\" of the vector is a Lorentz scalar and is given by\n\nwhere formula_6 is the proper time as measured by a clock in the rest frame of the particle and the Minkowski metric is given by\n\nThis is a time-like metric.\n\nOften the alternate signature of the Minkowski metric is used in which the signs of the ones are reversed.\n\nThis is a space-like metric.\n\nIn the Minkowski metric the space-like interval formula_9 is defined as\n\nWe use the space-like Minkowski metric in the rest of this article.\n\nThe velocity in spacetime is defined as\n\nwhere\n\nThe 4-acceleration is always perpendicular to the 4-velocity\n\nTherefore, we can regard acceleration in spacetime as simply a rotation of the 4-velocity. The inner product of the acceleration and the velocity is a Lorentz scalar and is zero. This rotation is simply an expression of energy conservation:\n\nwhere formula_15 is the energy of a particle and formula_16 is the 3-force on the particle.\n\nThe 4-momentum of a particle is\n\nwhere formula_18 is the particle rest mass, formula_19 is the momentum in 3-space, and\n\nis the energy of the particle.\n\nConsider a second particle with 4-velocity formula_21 and a 3-velocity formula_22. In the rest frame of the second particle the inner product of formula_21 with formula_24 is proportional to the energy of the first particle\n\nwhere the subscript 1 indicates the first particle.\n\nSince the relationship is true in the rest frame of the second particle, it is true in any reference frame. formula_26, the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle, is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore,\n\nin any inertial reference frame, where formula_28 is still the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle .\n\nIn the rest frame of the particle the inner product of the momentum is\n\nTherefore, the rest mass (m) is a Lorentz scalar. The relationship remains true independent of the frame in which the inner product is calculated.\nIn many cases the rest mass is written as formula_30 to avoid confusion with the relativistic mass, which is formula_31\n\nNote that\n\nThe square of the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the particle as measured in the frame of the second particle is a Lorentz scalar.\n\nThe 3-speed, in the frame of the second particle, can be constructed from two Lorentz scalars\n\nScalars may also be constructed from the tensors and vectors, from the contraction of tensors (such as formula_34), or combinations of contractions of tensors and vectors (such as formula_35).\n\n"}

It is addressed to Catullus' dead brother or, strictly speaking, to the \"mute ashes\" which are the only remaining evidence of his brother's body. \n\nThe tone is grief-stricken and tender, with Catullus trying to give the best gift he had to bestow (a poem) on his brother, who was taken prematurely. The last words, \"Hail and Farewell\" (in Latin, \"ave atque vale\"), are among Catullus' most famous; an alternative modern translation might be \"I salute you...and goodbye\".\n\nThe meter is elegiac couplet, which was usually employed in love poetry, such as Catullus' addresses to Lesbia. However, the elegiac couplet was originally used by ancient Greek poets to express grief and lamentation, making it an entirely suitable form to express Catullus' mourning.\n\nThis is one of three poems in which Catullus tries to cope with the loss of his brother. The other poems are Catullus 65 and 68B. The cause of his brother's death is unknown; he apparently died before 57 BC in Bithynia, a northwest region of modern-day Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy.\n\nIn addition to its inclusion among the many translations of Catullus' collected poems, \"Carmen\" 101 is featured in \"Nox\" (2010), a book by Canadian poet and classicist Anne Carson that comes in an accordion format within a box. \"Nox\" concerns the death of Carson's own brother, to which the poem of Catullus offers a parallel. Carson provides the Latin text of 101, word-by-word annotations, and \"a close and almost awkward translation.\" \n\nThe poem was also adapted in 1803 by the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo as the sonnet In morte del fratello Giovanni, (\"Un dì, s'io non andrò sempre fuggendo/di gente in gente...\") which commemorates the death of the poet's brother, Giovanni Foscolo.\n\nThis poem, as translated by Aubrey Beardsley, was set by the composer Ned Rorem under the title \"Catullus: On the Burial of his Brother\".\nThe Austrian music group Dargaard have also performed this poem in song on their album \"Rise and Fall\", naming it \"Ave Atque Vale\". Composer Frank Brickle set it for voice and two guitars in tribute to his mentor, Milton Babbitt.\n\nThe Norwegian band Tristania used \"ut te postremo donarem mortis\" in the choir of the song \"Angina\" from the album \"Beyond the Veil\" (1999). The band is famous for using the Latin choirs in their songs.\n\n\n\n"}

It has no representation at local or national level. Founded in 1991 as the Christian Principles Party, it stood candidates in the 1991 local elections, it was reformed as the Christian Centrist Party and ran candidates in the 1992 general election receiving 0.2% of first preference votes. It was renamed in 1994 to incorporate the word \"Solidarity\" following a mutual pledge of support between the party and the conservative advocacy group, Family Solidarity. Its first candidate was Catherine Kelly, contesting the 1994 Cork South-Central by-election, who received 1,704 (4.0%) first preference votes. The CSP took part in the 1997 general election and has contested each General Election, and a number of other by-elections since then. It also fielded candidates in Local and European Parliament elections since its foundation.\n\nIn the 2013 Meath East by-election the CSP supported the Direct Democracy Ireland candidate Ben Gilroy taking out newspaper adverts to support him, previously some CSP candidates included DDI on their election literature.\n\nIn 2013 the party lobbied the Standards in Public Office to Committee against the mandatory requirement for political parties accounts to be audited by an external body, claiming this would be a very high expense for a small party, where as parties represented in the Dáil have access to public funds for this.\nIn January 2014 the party's entry in the official register of political parties was cancelled,\n\nIn 2015, The Christian Solidarity party was registered as a third party with the Standards in Public Office, to receive donations for political purposes.\n\nIt advocates an orthodox version of Catholic social teaching, and its main proposals are based upon traditional, and unequivocal, anti-abortion natalism. The party promotes traditional family values and campaigns against marriage and adoption by same-sex couples.\nThe Party made written and oral submissions to various Oireachtas committees regarding proposed legislation on such family and social issues, as well as on other issues such as Seanad reform. The party describes itself as follows:\n\nThe party also campaigned against the announced closure of Ireland's embassy to the Vatican in 2011 and held a small demonstration outside of Leinster House.\n\nRichard Greene, its former leader, stepped down on 13 December 2012. Gerard Casey, who was the founder and led the party initially, is no longer active. Paul O'Loughlin, was leader and Dublin Central candidate. O'Loughlin's predecessor was Cathal Loftus. Daire Fitzgerald replaced Paul O'Loughlin on 21 November 2016.\n\n\nAlthough not on the official list of parties, the then party leader Commandant Cathal Ashbourne Loftus ran as a \"non-party\" candidate in the 2014 local elections in the Ashbourne ward, using the Christian Solidarity logo on his election leaflets.\n\nThe party nominated eight candidates in the 2011 general election five in Dublin and one each in Limerick, Meath and Cork.\n\nAt the party's election launch news conference conducted by then leader, Richard Greene stated that the party \"will campaign on a pro-life and what it calls a 'Euro-Realist' platform and that it will oppose making the poor pay for the economic crisis.\"\n\nThe party's Meath West candidate, Manus MacMeanmain (who polled 0.6% of first preference votes) was reportedly unhappy that the Christian Solidarity Party's logo was not present on the ballot paper, and claimed that the image that was used looked like \"a bunch of nuts\".\n\nThe party polled 0.1% of the votes and no deposits were saved.\n\nFor the 2009 local elections, they fielded candidates in 13 constituencies.

Paul O'Loughlin, the party's best-performing candidate, who had recently appeared on the party's party election broadcast, scored just 260 votes in Dublin Central, with 0.75% of the vote. The party as a whole scored 0.06% of the total national vote. The party candidates included:\n\nNone were elected.\n\nIn the 2004 European Parliament election, the CSP announced it had no plans to run, but later announced Barry Despard as a candidate. He came ninth of twelve candidates in the Dublin constituency with 5,352 first-preference votes, or 1.3% of the valid poll.\n\nIn the 2002 general election, the CSP ran 19 candidates, between the ages of 22 and 82.

No candidates were elected. All lost their deposits.\n\n\n\nThe Christian Solidarity Party campaigned against both Lisbon Treaty referendums. The party also made submissions to the Oireachtas committee on Ireland's future in Europe after the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty by the first vote. Some members participated in the Cóir campaign and in other anti-Lisbon treaty campaigns.\n\nThe Christian Solidarity Party campaigned, along with a number of other conservative groupings and individuals, for a No vote in the November 2012 Children's Rights Referendum.\n\nThe party claimed that the constitutional amendment would give too much power and responsibility to the State with regard to children, with Richard Greene stating that \"[t]he real agenda is to dismantle parents’ authority to protect their children, especially teenagers, and to increase State control...it could see the law deciding, for example, how far parents may monitor text messages or internet use to protect their children from bullying\".\n\nChristian Solidarity/Comhar Críostaí was registered as \"approved body\" to monitor postal voting and vote counting, with Cathal 'Ashbourne' Loftus designated as its officer, for the 2015 Same-sex marriage referendum.\n\nThe party and its members campaigned to retain the 8th amendment in the 2018 abortion referendum.\n\n"}

When the high-society organised the first Vienna ball in the Vilnius City Hall, he organised a party for the poor people in the square just outside the building. The Vienna ball did not take place the following year, which many people regarded as a victory for Šustauskas, as the idea became unpopular among members of high society.\n\nThese events raised the popularity of the Lithuanian Liberty Union, as many poorer people already saw high society as a den for corrupt thieves; the ideology which was propagated during communism, and was supported by several scandals in the 90s. The fact that Šustauskas sold his car and invested much of his own funds into these parties for poor people also helped his popularity. However, his and Liberty Union's popularity distribution over Lithuania was very uneven: it was most popular in Šustauskas's hometown Kaunas, but was lacking elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe Lithuanian Liberty Union gained a majority in Kaunas city municipality council, and Šustauskas became mayor of Kaunas. Later he was elected to the parliament of one of the electoral districts of Kaunas city. After this his popularity dwindled, as little was achieved, and there were several scandals concerning one member of his party, Enrikas Daktaras, son of Henrikas Daktaras (godfather of local mafia). Enrikas Daktaras was supposedly close to Šustauskas himself and was arrested for drug smuggling. Šustauskas also allegedly had problems with alcohol. He was not elected to parliament in 2004 elections and the Lithuanian Liberty Union lost the influence in Kaunas which it had held previously.\n\nVytautas Šustauskas is also known to have made several controversial statements, which caused him to be considered a Nazi by some; however he stated himself to be leftist. Although these quotes were said during heated television discussions, they attributed to the demise of politician, both by lowering his ratings and also causing an impeachment process to be initiated against him in parliament.

The Toledo Franchise was the first IHL franchise to be granted outside of the Windsor-Detroit area, for the cost of $1000 to Virgil Gladeaux of Toledo. The Mercurys existed 15 seasons in total from 1947 to 1962 with some minor naming variations. Toledo was successful on the ice, being the first IHL team to win multiple Turner Cup championships, and the first to do so consecutively. \n\nThe Mercurys won the Turner during their first year of operation in the 1947–48 season. Toledo defeated the Windsor Hettche Spitfires four games to one in the IHL championship series. Team coach and manager Andy Mulligan had signed nine players from his native Manitoba to build the team, including team captain and right-winger Max Labovitch, center Barney O'Connell and left wing Jake Kernahan . The Mercurys later won the United States Amateur hockey title, defeating the Elveth Rangers in two games, and the New York Rovers in three games. \n\nIn the 1948–49 season, the team played in both the north and south division of the IHL, because the team owners wanted to play more games. The Mercurys of the north division won the J. P. McGuire Trophy that year by capturing the IHL North title. In a rematch of the previous season's IHL championship, Windsor defeated Toledo four games to three.\n\nFor the 1949–50 season, the team was known as the Toledo Buckeyes while playing in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. They were sponsored by the former Buckeye Brewing Company in Toledo. The team returned to the IHL in 1950 known again as the Mercurys. Toledo won consecutive Turner Cups in 1950–51 and 1951–52 defeating the Grand Rapids Rockets in the finals both seasons.\n\nIn the 1955–56 season, the Mercurys played some home games in Marion, Ohio at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, hence being known as the Toledo-Marion Mercurys.

Her name was originally given as \"Isabel Dare\", but the collected edition of her first appearance said her surname was \"Kane\". According to editor Tom Brevoort, this change was deliberate; he even stated that \"Dare was a mistake in the first place,\" as the character was intended to be Captain Terror's granddaughter from her first appearance.\n\nYet more Smashers, operating directly under Imperial control, appear in the 'Infinity' crossover.\n\nThe title of Smasher has been used by three different humanoid aliens who served in the Shi'ar Imperial Guard.\n\nThe first Smasher was Vril Rokk, who had a long, distinguished service with the Guard. He was also romantically linked with fellow Guardsman Plutonia.\n\nIn \"Untold Tales of Captain Marvel\" — which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men — Smasher, the Guard, Marvel and the Kree all meet. A small division of the Guard, Deathbolt, Smasher, Fang and Oracle had been selected to guard the personage of Deathbird, the current ruler of the Shi'ar empire. They allied, then fought with the Kree after the latter came to their assistance against a murderous attack from the Skrulls. They later are involved with a confrontation against the Brood.\n\nWhen Cassandra Nova was decimating the Shi'ar empire, Smasher was one of the few entities that managed to personally protect the empress Lilandra. Under protest, Smasher is ordered to travel to Earth to warn the X-Men about the threat Nova posed. He crash lands in a field full of cows. He does not make it to the mansion until well after the Imperial Guard, brainwashed by Nova, were attempting to kill the X-Men. His presence manages to convince the Guard to fight against Nova, although he and the others were swiftly defeated by her.\n\nSmasher is later killed by Vulcan, a powerful mutant who attempts to conquer the Shi'ar empire.\n\nVril Rokk is soon replaced with another Smasher, Salac Tuur. The new Smasher was among the Imperial Guardsmen who attacked the Kree homeworld during the wedding of Crystal and Ronan the Accuser. During the battle, Smasher was slain by the Inhuman Karnak.\n\nThe uniform and title of Smasher has since been passed onto an unidentified member of the original's race. However, the newest version of Smasher was killed by Gladiator during a raid performed by Starjammers and Guardians of the Galaxy. The Strontian praetor killed Smasher as a sign of defecting to Lilandra.\n\nA new Smasher appears in the \"Marvel NOW!\" relaunch as part of Captain America's new Avengers line-up. She joins the Avengers to help fight Ex Nihilo on Mars. She is revealed to be Isabel \"Izzy\" Kane, a college student and astronomer from Iowa. After finding a pair of high-tech goggles that had been left behind in a cornfield by Vril Rokk when he crashed to the Earth to warn the X-Men about Cassandra Nova, Izzy becomes the new Smasher and Earth's first member of the Imperial Guard. Izzy is introduced to Captain America by her grandfather Dan Kane, an acquaintance from World War II.\n\nAs part of the Avengers, Izzy meets the Guardians of the Galaxy when their ship is ambushed and crashes into a mall's parking lot.\n\nWhen the source of mysterious seismic events was revealed to be A.I.M. Island, Smasher went to investigate along with Cannonball and Sunspot. When they arrived to the location, they were captured by A.I.M. Troopers. Smasher was chosen by Andrew Forson and Jude the Entropic Man to become his Messenger for the secret of the universe, that \"Everything dies.\" Smasher is made to do so by Andrew Forson.\n\nShe is later seen eight months in the future as seen in the \"Time Runs Out\" storyline having started a family with teammate Sam Guthrie. She later rejoins with an Avengers team headed by Roberto DaCosta and Thor. Their goal is to find the threat causing the slow death of the multiverse and to kill it. This brings Smasher in direct opposition with Captain America's group.\n\nSometime later, Smasher is seen with Cannonball and their son on another planet discussing about their future together, which leads to Cannonball deciding to quit the U.S.Avengers so that he could be with his family full time.\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Smasher arrives on Earth and tells Sunspot that Cannonball, who was believed to be dead, is alive on another planet.\n\nA new Smasher not affiliated with the Imperial Guard was introduced in \"Monsters Unleashed\". This version is a creation of Kid Kaiju that is composed of him and his five monsters Slizzik, Hi-Vo, Aegis, Scragg and Mekara. They come together to battle the Leviathon Mother when the Leviathon Tide invaded Earth.\n\nLike his predecessors, Smasher could naturally absorb cosmic radiation from his environment in order to increase his strength to superhuman levels.\n\nSmasher wore special goggles called \"exospex\" that enabled him to \"download\" additional superhuman powers. Via the exospex, he could obtain \"penta-vision\" (a form of X-ray vision), superhuman durability, even greater physical strength, and the ability to travel into hyperspace (\"4-space\"). Smasher was only capable of downloading one superpower at a time.\n\nSmasher wore small anti-gravity \"flight patches\" that enabled him to fly. Flight patches are standard issue for Imperial Guardsmen who lack the power of flight.\n\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the DC Comics' team Legion of Super-Heroes. Dave Cockrum (co-creator of the Guard) also had a long run as artist on the \"Legion\". Smasher is based on LSH member Ultra Boy.\n\nIn the alternate future of \"X-Men: The End\", Smasher is a veteran Guardian who is on duty when the plans of the series' main villain is revealed. He attacks with a small group of other Guardians. They are all slain, as a result, with Smasher's neck being snapped.\n\nSmasher also appears in \"Star Trek/X-Men\" #1 (December 1996). He and several other members of the Imperial Guard assist Deathbird in a mission.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1911565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911565", "title": "Cassandra Lang", "text": "Cassandra Lang\n\nCassandra \"Cassie\" Lang is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The daughter of Scott Lang, the character first appeared in \"Marvel Premiere\" #47 (April 1979) as Cassie Lang, in \"Young Avengers\" #6 (May 2006) as Stature and in \"Astonishing Ant-Man\" #6 (May 2016) as Stinger. A member of the Young Avengers and The Initiative, she has the same powers as her father, the ability to shrink and grow in size; however, she manifested her powers much later than her first exposure to Pym Particles.\n\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, the character was portrayed by Abby Ryder Fortson in \"Ant-Man\" (2015) and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018), and now by Emma Fuhrmann in \"\" (2019).\n\nCreated by David Michelinie and John Byrne, Cassie Lang first appeared in \"Marvel Premiere\" #47 (April 1979). She first appeared as Stature in \"Young Avengers\" #6 (May 2006), and adopted the identity of Stinger in \"The Astonishing Ant-Man\" #6 (May 2016).\n\nCassie Lang is introduced to the Marvel Universe as the ill daughter of Scott Lang. Her congenital heart condition forces her father to steal Hank Pym's Ant-Man equipment and Pym Particles, which he uses to rescue Doctor Sondheim, the only doctor able to cure Cassie's condition, from Cross Technological Enterprises.\n\nAfter the divorce of her parents, Cassie lives for most of her childhood with her father, whom she loves and admires greatly. Although Scott tries his best to keep his superhero life secret, Cassie gradually finds out that he is Ant-Man, and secretly experiments with his Pym Particle supplies on her own. She is fascinated by her father's life as a superhero, and generally has a good relationship with her father's colleagues; when she was younger, she even called Tony Stark \"Uncle Tony\". However, her mother and stepfather fear that his life with the Avengers is unsafe for a child, and they claim custody over Cassie.\n\nScott's time as an engineer for the Fantastic Four brings Cassie to the team's then-headquarters of Four Freedoms Plaza. In the spectacular environment Cassie calls home, she forges a strong friendship with the former ward of Doctor Doom, Kristoff Vernard. During the time they share a home with the Fantastic Four, Cassie helps Kristoff adjust to life outside of Doom's castle, and she develops a crush on him. It is also during this time that she meets her father in his Ant-Man identity, and confesses that she had known about it for a long time.\n\nAfter the Fantastic Four go missing and Cassie's father finds himself without a job, Scott takes employment at Oracle, Inc. with the Heroes for Hire (H4H). While working with the Heroes for Hire, Cassie has further adventures, accidentally activating the Super-Adaptoid and receiving horrifying visions of things to come. The H4H easily defeated Super-Adaptoid, and Cassie's participation in these dark events help her father and his allies defeat Master of the World in a battle for the fate of the Earth. All of these adventures give Cassie a taste for the action-filled life of a superhero, but it causes her mother to take sole custody from Scott.\n\nAs a result of Cassie being kept away from her father Scott, she grows more and more bitter toward her mother, and even more so toward her stepfather Blake Burdick. As a police officer, he cannot stand the world of superheroes the young girl loves, and he unsuccessfully tries to keep Cassie and Scott apart. For years, Cassie visits her father whenever possible, much to her mother and stepfather's chagrin, until the events of \"Avengers Disassembled\", when Scott is killed due to the actions of an insane Scarlet Witch.\n\nCassie retreats into herself, blaming Blake for being unable to understand her as her father always did. Blake tries unsuccessfully to be a caring stepfather, despite being sometimes distant toward her, seeing his stepdaughter as a \"less than brilliant\" girl. Some time after her father's death, and after another confrontation with her mother and stepfather, Cassie decides to run away to Los Angeles to join the Runaways, but after seeing the \"Young Avengers\" on television just before leaving, she subsequently changes her plans, as she later tells Jessica Jones.\n\nIron Lad, a younger version of classic Avengers foe Kang the Conqueror, desperate for help against his future self after learning what he will become, uses the Vision's database to track and recruit young superpowered individuals connected to the Avengers' history; however, Cassie Lang is not one of the individuals on the list. Wishing to join the Young Avengers, she and Kate Bishop meet the young heroes at the Avengers Mansion; when they refuse to let them join or to let her take her father's gear, she angrily rebukes them, only to discover much to her own shock that by doing so she had increased her size. She later confesses that she had repeatedly stolen Pym particles from her father for years, but until then it seemed they never had any effect on her. Cassie later displays the ability to also shrink.\n\nIron Lad assures her that if Vision had known she had developed powers, she would have been part of his plans for the Young Avengers, thus accepting her as a teammate; she then takes part in the battle against Kang, which ends in the villain's defeat. However, as the altered timeline causes several of them to disappear, Iron Lad realizes that he must return to his own time and accept the fact that he will become Kang, much to Cassie's sorrow, as she had fallen in love with him.\n\nWhile Captain America and Iron Man order the team to disband, both Cassie and Kate refuse and convince the others to keep the team active; after initially considering Ant-Girl or Giant-Girl, she ultimately adopts the codename Stature, along with a new costume based on her father's. Despite this, she feels guilty when overhearing her mother and stepfather discussing the possibility of her being a member of the team, also showing that rage or guilt make her respectively grow or shrink, metaphorically reflecting her being a \"shrinking violet\" about her family issues. After deciding to continue her life as a superhero, Cassie overhears her stepfather talking to her mother. They suspect that she is secretly Stature, but refuse to believe it. Later, Jessica Jones talks to Cassie's mother and confirms Cassie's dual identity. Cassie's mother is overwhelmed by this news and begs Jessica not to tell her husband about this due to his hatred of superheroes; she also worries that although Cassie was cured of her heart condition, her heart might not be able to handle the strain of continuous size-changing.\n\nWhen Jessica Jones asks Cassie if there isn't even a small part of her wishing for a normal life, Cassie replies, \"Ms. Jones, my dad was Ant-Man. I never had a normal life.\" \n\nIn the \"Civil War\" limited series, Cassie, along with her fellow Young Avengers, join Captain America's resistance to the Superhero Registration Act; she and the rest of her team stay at a safe house, while Nick Fury arranges new secret identities for them. During this time, she participates in a rescue effort, which turns out to be a trap laid by Iron Man: during the subsequent battle, Goliath is killed by a clone of Thor and her teammate Wiccan is captured. Afterwards, Cassie opts to leave Captain America's side and to register, citing her reasons as wishing to fight villains rather than cops and other heroes.\n\nCassie Lang joins the Initiative, as a trainee. Along with fellow Initiative members Dusk, Tigra, Silverclaw, and Araña, she is ensnared by the Puppet Master. Although she (along with the others) is mentally controlled into fighting Ms. Marvel, she is eventually freed from the mind control.\n\nHer time at Camp Hammond brings her in to contact with her father's successor as Ant-Man: Eric O'Grady. O'Grady makes several disparaging remarks about her father, not realizing that she is within earshot; this causes a literally giant-sized brawl between the two as both grow to their giant forms. After O'Grady picks up a bus and hits Lang with it, Henry Pym intervenes. Taskmaster breaks up the fight by attacking their now giant-sized Achilles tendons, bringing all three crashing to the ground.\n\nLater, the Vision visits Cassie, disguising himself as Tony Stark in order to take her out on a date. After fighting off an attempt by A.I.M. to steal the Vision, he confesses that because he was programmed based on Iron Lad's mental patterns, he shares Iron Lad's attraction to her, and hopes that she can love him; Cassie is unsure, but does not reject him, telling him to give her time to sort things out.\n\nCassie accidentally injures her stepfather Blake while stopping the Growing Man. Her guilt causes her to continue shrinking down, and the other Young Avengers attempt to snap her out of it before she shrinks into non-existence. With the help of Patriot, she comes to terms with the responsibilities and risks of her position as part of the Young Avengers and the Initiative, reasoning that Blake also faces the risks as a policeman.\n\nStature fights against the Skrull invasion of Manhattan as part of the Initiative. She grows larger than the Skrull Yellowjacket and punches him out.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Skrull invasion, Cassie Lang leaves the Initiative at the start of the \"Dark Reign\" storyline and rejoins the Young Avengers. Cassie and Vision (now seemingly in a relationship) fly to the Avengers Mansion ruins, having been summoned by Wiccan with warnings of a great magical threat. After finding their teammates turned to stone, they encounter the Scarlet Witch transporting them away to be a part of the Mighty Avengers, led by Hank Pym. Despite her evident and vocal distrust of Scarlet Witch, whom she holds responsible for her father's death, she remains on the team. During a confrontation with the Fantastic Four for a device of the late Bill Foster, she refuses to participate in the attack and instead warns them about what was really happening, citing her reluctance to fight those she feels are like family to her. Eventually, Cassie's distrust of Scarlet Witch leads her to expose her as Loki in disguise. While part of the team, Lang also fights a demi-god at Mount Wundagore and a homicidal ancient Inhuman.\n\nNorman Osborn later mounts a full-scale attack on Asgard. Teaming up with the rest of the Mighty Avengers one last time, Cassie and Vision help stop the Thunderbolts from delivering Odin's Spear (an Asgardian weapon of virtually limitless power) to the Iron Patriot; in the battle, she also fights the new Ant-Man again.\n\nAt some point, Cassie applies for a babysitter job with Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, though more in the hope of eventually finding her way into the ranks of the New Avengers rather than any dedication to babysitting itself; she is dismissed in favor of Squirrel Girl.\n\nWhen Wiccan's uncontrolled magical energy nearly kills several members of the Sons of the Serpent, the Avengers begin to fear that he might become another Scarlet Witch; they explain to the Young Avengers how the Scarlet Witch went insane after the loss of her twin boys, resulting in the death of the original Vision and Scott Lang, and rendering nearly all of the world's mutants powerless. When Wiccan feels unsure about what to do, Cassie suggests that they try to find the Scarlet Witch, believing that if they can show her that her children are alive, she may be able to reverse everything she has done, including her father's death.\n\nDuring the team's search in Latveria, Cassie is reunited with Iron Lad, and, when he takes the team back to the period of Avengers Disassembled, she is able to bring her father forward in time to the present, avoiding his original death from the attack by Jack of Hearts. After she manifests her powers in front of him, Scott tells her he's proud of her.\n\nAfter the Scarlet Witch is found, Dr. Doom steals her reality warping powers and fights the combined forces of the Avengers and X-Men. As Doom seemingly kills her father (who actually managed to shrink down and escape with minor wounds), a distraught Cassie charges the super-powered dictator, gaining time for Scarlet Witch and Wiccan to prepare a joint spell to remove his new powers; however, Doom retaliates by blasting Cassie with an explosive spell, killing her. Although Iron Lad offers to take her into the future to save her, his offer is rejected by the other Young Avengers, as it is more in line with what Kang would do than what an Avenger should do. While contemplating rebuilding the Vision (who Iron Lad destroyed in rage when he protested against his plans to save Cassie), the Young Avengers realize that they would have to tell a restored Vision about Cassie's death, and thus decide not to follow through with the rebuilding. Kate expresses her desire to believe that Vision and Cassie are somehow together in the afterlife. The team disbands and a statue of Cassie and the Vision's is built in their honor in the gardens of the mansion.\n\nBentley 23 (a clone of Wizard) of the Future Foundation later postulates that, due to the unstable nature of Pym Particles, Cassie's body could conceivably regenerate into an ionic form similar to the resurrection of Wonder Man; he suggests digging up the corpse to check, stating that he is sure his classmates are thinking the same thing.\n\nDuring the \"AXIS\" storyline, Doctor Doom is transformed into a more heroic, altruistic form as a result of the battle with the Red Skull that involved a spell that inverted heroes and villains' personalities. Seeking redemption for his past crimes, but only able to draw on enough power to alter one key event, Doom chooses to use that power to resurrect Cassie. She is then seen tearfully reuniting with her father and his new girlfriend Darla Deering.\n\nIn the \"Ant-Man\" ongoing series, she is shown living a normal life as a middle-school student. Worried that Scott's lifestyle and actions might attract more danger to her, Cassie's mother decides to relocate to Miami despite Cassie's reluctance. Scott nonetheless decides to relocate there as well to stay near his daughter. She is later kidnapped by Crossfire on behalf of Augustine Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises; Cross believes that Cassie's Pym Particle-irradiated heart can sustain Darren Cross's sickly body. Scott didn't arrive in time to prevent the transplant of Cassie's heart (which caused the revived Darren Cross to shrink uncontrollably) and so Dr. Sondheim was forced to transplant another one in Cassie's body, with Scott slowing down her immune system enough to make sure it is not rejected. While Cassie survived, not knowing herself what had happened to her, Scott was so shaken up by that experience that he decided to leave her, reasoning that he cannot risk to put her in harm's way again and that she deserves a normal and happy life he cannot provide.\n\nA now depowered Cassie struggles with her everyday activities, while feeling frustrated by her current status; feeling resentful over Scott's seeming disappearance, she is later shocked and outraged to find out that he was secretly following her around, watching over her. One day, she is reunited with Kate, who has found out about her resurrection; despite her lack of powers, she follows her friend to a Secret Empire hideout, but almost gets killed, which further fuels her frustration, despite Kate's assurances that she is still special her own way. However, Cassie ultimately decides to turn to the new Power Broker to regain her powers; although he realizes that she has no intention of actually becoming a supervillain, he tells her about Darren Cross having stolen her heart and that her father hid it from her. Power Broker offers a deal, in which he will grant her wish if she infiltrates Cross' base to shut him down; Cassie accepts, and adopts the new codename Stinger. When Scott learns about her disappearance, he rushes to help her, but ends up captured in her place; however, Cassie manages to get his crew to help him escape. In the end, though, because of Darla's show, they end up discovered by the police; to protect his daughter, Scott takes the blame and claims he kidnapped and forced her to help him. Cassie captures Power Broker shortly after her father's arrest. When Cassie finally confesses to her mother what she did, Peggy takes her to the trial, where Darren Cross in the Yellowjacket suit and his henchmen (Crossfire and Egghead) burst into the courtroom to get revenge on Scott. Cassie rushes to help her father, and the two make amends during the fight, which ends with Cassie defeating Cross. Cassie's mother is called as the final prosecution witness, but surprisingly she declares that Scott was innocent, as he always looked after Cassie and has always been her hero, admitting that he took the blame for what she did; this allowed Scott to be acquitted. Afterward, Cassie finally receives her mother's blessing as a superhero, and joins her father as a new crimefighting duo.\n\nCassie Lang has the ability to increase and decrease her size. She can become roughly tall and can shrink to the size of an ant. Her abilities seemed to be fueled by her emotions. She grows when she gets angry and shrinks when she feels guilty. Cassie seems to have become more powerful since first demonstrating her powers, as she has in recent issues surpassed her previous growth limit. At first she struggled to shrink to 6 inches and grow to 10–15 feet. She has been seen growing larger than the Skrull Yellowjacket, who could grow to at least tall. It was established that she and Hank Pym share an upper limit of somewhere around in height, and that, if she keeps her bigger dimensions for too long, Cassie will suffer from strains that will eventually force her to shrink back down.\n\nAs Stinger, she has a helmet similar to that of Ant-Man, which allows her to communicate with and control \"over five thousands species of ants and insects\"; she also sports a suit with bio-synthetic wings that allow her to fly, and that can fire bio-electric blasts from the wrists.\n\nIn MC2, Cassandra Lang is now a doctor and operates under the name Stinger on the group A-Next. Although she is the oldest member of A-Next, in her mid-20s, and the only one on the original team with a professional life and a scientific background, she is still doted on by her father, who constantly worries about her newfound superhero life. She possesses many abilities originally engineered by Henry Pym, including resizing, flying, communication with insects, and firing bioelectric \"stinger\" blasts (as well artificial \"stingers\" sedative darts), all based on her costume and helmet. She does not seem to be capable of increasing her size and strength, unlike her main continuity version.\n\nIn issue 3 of \"Avengers Fairy Tales\", Cassie Lang is portrayed as Alice of \"Alice in Wonderland\". She encounters Wonderland versions of the Young Avengers. At first, her emotions cause her to grow and shrink beyond her control. She also meets Wonderland versions of Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Tigra.\n\n\nCassie Lang, under the codename Stature, went with her team on the search for the Scarlet Witch. In the alternate future timeline glimpsed during the \"Children's Crusade\", Cassie was shown as a member of the future Avengers under the codename Stinger. It was later revealed that it had been Wiccan, now renamed Sorcerer Supreme, posing as Stinger to get Iron Lad to go back in time.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Cassie Lang appears in \"\" initially as Giant-Woman, and later as Stature. A member of the Ultimates Reserves' Giant-Women squad, she was brainwashed by Thor's son Modi to battle Spider-Man but is defeated. Giant-Woman later recovers and rescues the shot down S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier during a skirmish with HYDRA. Monica Chang subsequently offers Giant-Woman a spot on the Ultimates due to the bravery she displayed during the battle with HYDRA. However, Stature later resurfaced as a member of Nick Fury's Howling Commandos, as assistance against the Maker's Dark Ultimates.\n\nCassie Lang appears in \"\", voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey. In the episode \"To Steal an Ant-Man\", she has been captured by Crossfire so that Scott Lang could pay back money that he owes. With help from Hank Pym and the Heroes for Hire, Ant-Man rescued Cassie from Crossfire's henchmen.\n\n\n\n"}

It is named after the botanist John Bellenden Ker Gawler. Located south of Cairns near Babinda, it is adjacent to Mount Bartle Frere, the state's highest peak, part of the Bellenden Ker Range which is also known as the Wooroonooran Range. The two mountains dominate the Josephine Falls section of the Wooroonooran National Park. Both peaks are made of resistant granite and are remnants of an escarpment that has been eroded by the Russell and Mulgrave Rivers.\n\nSeveral television transmitter towers have been built on the mountain. The only access to the television transmitter site and the mountain top weather station is by a privately owned cable car.\n\nIn 1873, Walter Hill, Queensland's first Colonial botanist, undertook an expedition to northern Queensland to collect native plants and included a trip to Mount Bellenden Ker. In the same year Robert Arthur Johnstone climbed the peak while exploring the coastal lands south of Cooktown with George Elphinstone Dalrymple. Another expedition to the summit, led by Archibald Meston (1851-1924), was conducted in early February to early March 1889.\n\nThe mountain lies in the Wooroonooran Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of a range of bird species endemic to Queensland's Wet Tropics.\n\nThe rain gauge at its summit records an annual average rainfall of , making it the wettest meteorological station in Australia. It also holds the record for the highest rainfall in a calendar year of in 2000 and the highest rainfall in Australia for a calendar month of in January 1979.\n\nIn 2006, the mountain received more rainfall – – than any other part of Australia.

{"id": "1911572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911572", "title": "Sausage (band)", "text": "Sausage (band)\n\nSausage was a short-lived alternative/funk rock band featuring a reunion of the 1988 lineup of the San Francisco Bay Area band Primus. They released the album Riddles Are Abound Tonight in April 1994 through the Interscope Records imprint Prawn Song Records.\n\nSausage reunited on December 31, 2019 to perform for the first time in 25 years. \n\nPrimus was formed in 1984 by singer and bassist Les Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth. The two of them played with a number of drummers before eventually settling on Tim \"Curveball\" Wright two years later. At this time, Jay Lane was playing with The Uptones, and later the Freaky Executives, for whom Claypool acted as a roadie. Claypool was a huge fan of Lane's, and when Wright left Primus in the summer of 1988, Lane was asked to suggest his replacement. Lane accepted the position himself, as the Freaky Executives were, in Claypool's words, \"in record company hell. They were somehow getting dicked around by their record company\".\n\nAfter recording a demo together, which they titled \"Sausage\", Lane left Primus at the end of 1988 when \"something good happened\" with the Freaky Executives' record deal. Huth also left shortly after, wishing to dedicate more time to his family as he had just had a son and was expecting another. Claypool continued Primus, replacing Huth and Lane with Larry LaLonde and Tim Alexander, respectively.\n\nIn 1994, Claypool, Huth, and Lane reunited to record the album \"Riddles Are Abound Tonight\" under the name Sausage, inspired by the demo they had recorded together in 1988. The album was released in April 1994 by Prawn Song Records, a vanity label owned by Claypool and subsidiary of Interscope Records, and was supported by a short tour during which the band opened for Helmet and Rollins Band.\n\nIn his review for Allmusic, Bret Love compared the album to Primus' output favourably in some respects, describing Sausage as \"a tighter, more focused groove machine\" with a \"more accessible sound\", but also noted that the lack of \"instrumental virtuosity, strange time signatures, and almost constant left-field changes\" would likely leave Primus fans generally unsatisfied.\n\nA music video was made for the title track, \"Riddles Are Abound Tonight\", co-directed by Claypool and Mark Kohr and filmed at the Oakland Scottish Rite Clinic for Childhood Language Disorders. It shows the band members playing their instruments in close proximity while each wearing a hooded blue leotard featuring a small lightbulb on the end of an antenna, similar to that of an anglerfish. These tops are then revealed to all be connected at the waist and part of a larger sheet of fabric that stretches out to cover the top of a three-tiered scaffold structure surrounded by various lamps and stage lights. Under the sheet, the band are pedalling stationary bicycles that in turn run a vast series of gears powering the lights. The middle layer of the scaffold structure houses a go-go dancer, and below her a woman in a Victorian dress uses sign language while children in similar attire perform a baroque dance around the structure.\n\nOn-set, Kohr described the video as a metaphor; the band representing \"the gods... above the blue sky... pedalling the works of the universe\", their music filtering down through \"the black goddess woman... the personification of the sensuality within the music\" until it reaches \"Mother Earth, communicating the lines of the music to the people... adults, but they're little kids. So basically, we're teaching the kids how to dance.\" Claypool, on the other hand, said \"I just thought it would look cool... like a giant penis, and we were the blue sperm.\"\n\nThe video was featured on \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", during which Butt-Head mockingly referred to the band as \"The Seminifreous Tubloidial Buttnoids\". The music video was later included on Claypool's retrospective DVD \"5 Gallons of Diesel\" alongside a short clip about the making of the video, and live footage of the band performing \"Prelude to Fear\".\n\nIn 1996, Claypool released his debut solo album, \"Highball with the Devil\", featuring Lane playing drums on four tracks. In the summer of 2000, Claypool, Huth and Lane reunited with additional musicians as Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade, releasing the albums \"Live Frogs Set 1\" and \"Live Frogs Set 2\" in 2001. Lane also appears on four tracks of the Frog Brigade's 2002 studio album, \"Purple Onion\", though Huth does not. In 2010, Lane rejoined Primus with Claypool and Larry LaLonde, featuring on the \"June 2010 Rehearsal\" EP and the 2011 studio album \"Green Naugahyde\".\n\nThe band are reuniting for the first time in 25 years on December 31, 2019 to celebrate New Year's Eve. \n\n"}

During the 1950s, Waterfield also worked in the motion picture business, initially as an actor and later as a producer. He remained involved in football as an assistant coach during the 1950s and served as the head coach of the Rams from 1960 to 1962.\n\nWaterfield was born in Elmira, New York, in 1920, the son of Staton \"Jack\" Waterfield (1891–1930) and Frances (Gallagher) Waterfield (1895–1963). In approximately 1921, his family moved to Los Angeles and settled in Van Nuys in the San Fernando Valley. In 1930, when Waterfield was nine years old, his father, who had become the owner and manager of Van Nuys Transfer and Storage Company, died.

Jim Benton caught 10 of Waterfield's passes for an NFL record of 303 receiving yards in a single game.\n\nOn December 16, 1945, in the 1945 NFL Championship Game, Waterfield led the Rams to a 15–14 victory over Sammy Baugh's Washington Redskins in below zero weather in Cleveland. One sports writer opined that Waterfield \"literally\" beat the Redskins \"singlehanded.\" Waterfield was responsible for both Cleveland touchdowns on passes of 37 and 44 yards, and his punts kept the Redskins pinned deep in their territory. Rams owner Dan Reeves announced that, before the game, Waterfield had signed a three-year contract for $20,000 per year, which made him the highest-paid player in pro football.\n\nAfter the season, Waterfield received the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the NFL's Most Valuable Player, outpacing Steve Van Buren by a tally of 65 points to 38. He was also a consensus pick as the first-team quarterback on the 1945 All-Pro Team.\n\nIn January 1946, less than a month after winning Cleveland's first NFL championship, the Rams announced that they would move to Los Angeles for the 1946 NFL season. In their first season in Los Angeles, the Rams compiled a 6–4–1 record and finished in second place in the NFL's Western Division. Waterfield firmly established himself as one of the NFL's multi-talented players. As a passer, he led the NFL in pass attempts (251), completions (127), and passing touchdowns (17) and ranked second with 1,747 passing yards and a 67.6 passer rating. He was also the league's second leading scorer (61 points). He led the NFL with 37 extra points out of 37 attempts and field goal percentage (66.7%) and finished third in the league with an average of 44.7 yards per punt. At the end of the season, he was selected by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press (UP) as the first-team quarterback on the 1946 All-Pro Team.\n\nIn 1947, the Rams dropped to fourth place in the NFL's West Division, and Waterfield did not rank among the league's leaders in any passing category except interceptions. He did, however, lead the NFL with seven field goals and had an 86-yard punt that was the longest in the NFL during the 1947 season. In 1948, the Rams finished in third place in the West. Waterfield ranked among the NFL leaders with 15.6 yards per pass completion (first), 14 passing touchdowns (fourth), and 18 interceptions (third), and for the second year ha had the longest punt in the league, this one measuring 88 yards. On October 4, 1948, Waterfield led the Rams to a 28–28 tie with the NFL champion-to-be Philadelphia Eagles; the Rams trailed, 28–0, in the third quarter, but Waterfield completed 17 of 35 passes for 263 yards and three touchdowns to lead the comeback.\n\nIn his first four NFL seasons, Waterfield also played defense and intercepted 20 passes.\n\nWaterfield and Rams returned to the NFL's elite during the 1949 season. The Rams won the NFL's Western Division championship with an 8–2–2 record and lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1949 NFL Championship Game. In 12 regular season games, Waterfield compiled career highs and ranked among the NFL leaders with 154 completed passes (third), 296 pass attempts (fourth), 2,168 passing yards (second), and 24 interceptions (first). For the third time in his career, he was selected as the quarterback on the 1948 All-Pro Team, receiving first-team honors from the AP and UP.\n\nIn 1950, Waterfield shared the quarterback position with Norm Van Brocklin with each starting six games. Waterfield's 57.3% completion percentage was the best in the NFL for the 1950 season. The 1950 Rams compiled a 9–3, won the National Conference championship, defeated the Chicago Bears in a divisional playoff game, and lost to the Cleveland Browns in the 1950 NFL Championship Game. In the playoff game against the Bears, Waterfield came off the bench suffering from the flu and completed 14 of 21 passes for 280 yards, including touchdown passes of 68, 28, and 22 yards to Tom Fears; Waterfield also kicked a 43–yard field goal and three extra points in the game. After the game, George Halas called the Rams \"the finest passing team I've ever played against.\" On the first play from scrimmage in the 1950 NFL Championship Game, Waterfield threw an 82-yard touchdown pass to Glenn Davis, but the Browns prevailed, 30–28.\n\nDuring the off-season following the 1950 season, Waterfield tried his hand at an acting career. He starred with Johnny Weissmuller in \"Jungle Manhunt\" (also known as \"Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land\"), playing the part of a football player stranded in the jungle.\n\nIn the fall of 1951, Waterfield resumed his role as the Rams' regular starting quarterback, starting 10 of the Rams' 12 games at the position. He led the 1951 Rams to an 8–4 record and the NFL championship. During the 1951 season, Waterfield led the NFL with an 81.8 passer rating, an average of 17.8 yards per completion, and 13 field goals made. He ranked second in the league with 98 points scored. He also had the longest pass in the NFL during the 1951 season, a 91-yard touchdown pass to Elroy Hirsch in a 42–17 victory over the Chicago Bears. At the end of the 1951 season, Waterfield played in his second Pro Bowl and was selected by the UP as the second-team quarterback (behind Otto Graham) on the 1951 All-Pro Team.\n\nIn 1952, Waterfield shared the Rams' quarterback job with Norm Van Brocklin, each starting six games. The Rams compiled a 9–3 and lost a divisional playoff game against the Detroit Lions. He announced his retirement on December 1, 1952, and was honored with Bob Waterfield Day for the Rams' final home game on December 14, 1952. The Rams retired Waterfield's No. 7 jersey and presented Waterfield with gifts in pregame ceremonies.\n\nAt the time of his retirement in December 1952, Waterfield held four NFL career records (315 extra points and 60 field goals), a single-season record with 54 extra points in 1950, and a single-game record with five field goals in a game, and was tied for another single-game record with nine extra points in a game.\n\nDuring eight seasons with the Rams, he led the team to two NFL championships and four divisional championships. He averaged 42.4 yards as a punter, and he completed 814 passes for 11,849 yards and 97 touchdowns.\n\nIn 1954, Waterfield went into business with his wife, Jane Russell, forming Russ-Field Productions to produce motion pictures. Their productions included \"Run for the Sun\" (1956) and \"The King and Four Queens\" (1957).\n\nWaterfield also worked as the Rams' kicking coach in 1954 and again in 1955, working with Rams' linebacker Les Richter on his placekicking. In 1957, he also worked as an assistant coach for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League.\n\nIn June 1958, Waterfield returned to the NFL as an assistant coach for the Rams. He was assigned to develop the team's quarterbacks. He developed Bill Wade into an outstanding quarterback in 1958, but Waterfield left the team after the 1958 season.\n\nSid Gillman resigned as the Rams head coach after the team went 2–10 in 1959. In January 1960, Waterfield signed a five-year contract to take over as the Rams' head coach. After two seasons with four wins each, the third season in 1962 was even less successful and he resigned after the eighth game with just one win. Waterfield's overall record as the Rams' head coach was 9–24–1 (.289). He was later a team scout and a rancher near Van Nuys.\n\nWaterfield received numerous awards and honors for his football career, including the following:\n\nOn April 24, 1943, Waterfield married actress Jane Russell, his sweetheart from Van Nuys High School who had subsequently gained fame as a pin-up girl. The couple eloped to Las Vegas shortly after Waterfield entered the military. They adopted three children, Thomas, Tracy, and Robert John, during the 1950s. Russell filed for divorce in February 1967, and Waterfield counterclaimed accusing Russell of habitual intemperance and excessive drinking. The divorce was granted in July 1968, with custody of the two oldest children being granted to Russell and custody of the youngest to Waterfield. He married Janet Ann Green in 1970.\n\nAfter an extended illness, Waterfield died of respiratory failure on March 25, 1983, at the age of 62, five weeks before his teammate Van Brocklin. He had been in the intensive care unit at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank for two weeks prior to his death.\n"}

{"id": "1911585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911585", "title": "Dungeon (comics)", "text": "Dungeon (comics)\n\nDungeon (French title: Donjon) is a series of comic fantasy comic books created by Joann Sfar and Lewis Trondheim, with contributions from numerous other artists. It was originally published in France by Delcourt as a series of graphic albums; English translations of the first several stories have been released by NBM Publishing, first in a black-and-white periodical version and now as several color graphic novels.\n\nThe series is a parody of sword and sorcery conventions in general, and specifically of the role-playing game \"Dungeons and Dragons\". All of the characters are either anthropomorphic animals or other strange creatures. The \"dungeon\" of the title is, in the original series, a business establishment run by a mild-mannered chicken, where heroes come in search of adventure and treasure and invariably die. The timeline in the main continuity is described as the stages of day; the series that lead up to the dungeon's creation are described in the \"Potron-Minet\" (Dawn) segment, the castle's glory days are described as its Zénith, and its inevitable decay is described in the \"Crépuscule\" (Twilight) stories.\n\nNow mostly available in English, the French \"Donjon\" is an extremely ambitious work consisting of three sub-series and various side projects. \n\nWith art by Christophe Blain and Christophe Gaultier, the five volumes of this series take place in an earlier era, describing events leading up to the creation of the titular dungeon. In English translation, the \"Dawn\" series is called \"Early Years\". \n\nDZ portrays the \"golden age\" of the world of Terra Amata . Albums 1 to 4 are drawn by Trondheim, and from 5 onwards by Boulet.\n\nIn this darker series, of 8 volumes, Herbert the Duck has become the dark overlord of the Dungeon, known as The Great Khan. Marvin the dragon, old and blind, teams with Marvin the Red, a brash rabbit warrior. The first three volumes are drawn by Sfar, the others by various artists.\n\nThe five volumes of \"Dungeon Parade\" take place between volumes 1 and 2 of \"Dungeon Zenith\", starring its protagonists Marvin and Herbert. The artist is Manu Larcenet.\n\n\"Donjon Monstres\" features secondary characters from throughout the story. \"Monstres\" stories can be set anywhere in the timeline, and feature occasional appearances by the major characters. There is a wide variety of artists in the 12 volumes.\n\nThe \"Zenith\" books begin at number 1, while \"Potron-Minet\" begins at -99 and \"Crepuscule\" at 101, implying that the authors intended to produce an unprecedented number of books. \nTrondheim originally stated in interviews that the authors \"weren't crazy\" and wouldn't release 300 books, trusting the reader to fill in the blanks of the missing numbers. However, in later interviews, he hinted that he had changed his mind and was seduced by the idea of creating a long-running and complex series of 300 books, which seemed possible with the collaboration of several different authors.\n\nA third sub-series called \"Donjon Bonus\" exists of different editions (black and white or smaller format omnibuses) and work outside the comics, like the role-playing game \"Clefs en Mains\".\n\nWith the 2014 issuance of the last two volumes of Dungeon Twilight, Trondheim and Sfar emphasized in an interview that the main story was \"completely done\". Trondheim said that new stories were \"very improbable\" due to Sfar's schedule; Sfar left the door open for more stories to be told.\n\nIn 2019, Trondheim and Sfar announced on Instagram that they would return to Dungeon : https://www.instagram.com/p/BtHM0tngrN2/\n\nTwo new series (Donjon Antipodes - 10000 and (Donjon Antipodes + 10000) should see the light of day in 2020 alongside a new Zenith album.\n\nThe following tables show all French paperback collections released so far, with information about English releases. Please note that in the Main Series table the Volume also corresponds to the level of the book. \n\n\nSince the series start, it has grown into quite a large collection of volumes. The place of each book in an orderly timeline is worked out using levels (French: Niveau). The volume number of books in the main series (Dawn, Zenith and Twilight) is also their level. The Monsters and Parade level numbers are written down in the original books on the first page below the page number.\n\n"}

{"id": "1911591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911591", "title": "Alderaan", "text": "Alderaan\n\nAlderaan is a fictional planet featured in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. It is blue-green in appearance, depicted as a terrestrial planet with humanoid inhabitants, and characterized by a peaceful culture. It is the home planet of Princess Leia Organa, one of the lead characters in the film series. In the original 1977 film, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser.\n\nEarly drafts of the \"Star Wars\" story include references to at least two planets which later evolved into the concept of Alderaan. \"Star Wars\" author George Lucas included a planet called Alderaan in early treatments; in \"The Star Wars\" (1973), \"Alderaan\" is a city-planet and the capital planet of the galaxy (prefiguring the planet Coruscant which later featured in the films). The draft script opens with a scene in which an \"eerie blue-green\" planet called \"Aquilae\" is threatened by an armed space fortress.\n\nIn Lucas's 1975 draft, \"Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars\", the capital planet of Alderaan is described as a floating city in the clouds, \"suspended in a sea of cirrus methane\". A planet described in Lucas's draft script as being \"under siege by the Imperial Legions of Alderaan\" and which is later destroyed is named as \"Ogana Major\". Early sketches commissioned by Lucas from conceptual illustrator Ralph McQuarrie show a design which very closely resembles Cloud City, as featured in the later sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back\". In Lucas's third draft, the Imperial City of Alderaan has become the home world of the Sith Lords, and Darth Vader holds Princess Leia captive here. Lucas continued to hone his script, aided by screenwriters Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz; names of planets and characters were revised and the narrative was improved, and by the fourth draft, scenes on the Imperial capital planet had been moved to a space station called the Death Star and the peaceful world destroyed by the Empire had taken the name Alderaan.\n\nThe on-screen depictions of Alderaan in the \"Star Wars\" films are scant; the distant planet is seen momentarily in \"Star Wars\" (1977) prior to its destruction, and in \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005) a short scene shows a city amid a snow-covered, mountainous landscape.\n\nAlderaan was originally featured in the first film, \"Star Wars\", released in 1977. The opening scene depicts the capture of a small spaceship from Alderaan, the \"Tantive IV\", by the Galactic Empire, and introduces the character of Princess Leia Organa, a princess of the Royal House of Alderaan who is played by Carrie Fisher.\n\nAlderaan appears in a later scene in the film, but is only shown on-screen in a distant view from space as the Empire's gigantic space station, the Death Star, moves into orbit around the planet. The battle station's commander, the Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders the Death Star's superweapon to be fired at the planet. Alderaan explodes instantly in a ball of fire. It is later shown that the shattered planet has been reduced to a cloud of asteroids as the \"Millennium Falcon\" spaceship attempts to visit the planet.\n\nThe destruction of Alderaan meant that it was not depicted in subsequent \"Star Wars\" films until the series of prequel films was produced. The planet made its first on-screen appearance since 1977 in \"\" (2005), appearing briefly at the end of the film. The adoptive father of Princess Leia, Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) is seen piloting a starship to the planet's surface, which is shown as a mountainous, alpine region covered in snow. Landing his ship in a citadel among the mountains, he brings the newborn Princess Leia into his royal palace. The backdrop for these scenes was created by compositing landscape footage of Grindelwald in Switzerland with CGI images of the city.\n\nThe planet is not featured in the 2016 film \"Rogue One\", but the character Bail Organa makes an appearance, stating that he will return to Alderaan to wait for his daughter, Leia, to bring the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. This precedes the narrative of the 1977 film, \"A New Hope\".It is assumed he dies when the Death Star destroys the planet.\n\nIn an episode of the animated television series \"\" entitled \"Assassin\", Ahsoka Tano has premonitions of Padmé's death on Alderaan.\n\nThe mercenary Carasynthia \"Cara\" Dune, in \"The Mandalorian\", is a former Republican Shock Trooper from Alderaan, according to Moff Gideon.\n\nThe comic series \"\" (2015) deals with Princess Leia and Evan (a female rebel pilot also native from Alderaan), rescuing survivors from Alderaan's destruction. It also features a brief flashback to Leia's childhood on the planet and her relationship with her adoptive father Senator Bail Organa.\n\nIn \"Star Wars\" #33 (2017), Leia tells Luke that sometimes she can see Alderaan among the stars as, from certain perspectives in the galaxy, its light has not ceased to emit.\n\nAlderaan is mentioned frequently and also serves as a location in several works in the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, the collection of books, comics and other material considered outside official canon, now branded \"Star Wars Legends\". In various stories, Alderaan is presented as the home of the characters Tycho Celchu, and of Ulic Qel Droma who fought in the Great Sith War in 4000 BBY.\n\nThe 1981 NPR/BBC radio drama adaptation of \"Star Wars\" features scenes set on Alderaan, in which Princess Leia discusses her mission to acquire the Death Star plans from agents of the Rebel Alliance with her father, Bail Organa (Prestor Organa). In a later scene, she is confronted by the Imperial commander Lord Tion and accused of treason. It is established that Alderaan has a strict policy against weapons.\n\nIn Michael A. Stackpole's 1998 novel, \"I, Jedi\", Alderaan features as the sanctuary of the Caamasi when their home world of Caamas is devastated by the Galactic Empire.\n\nAlderaan is featured in a 1991 role-playing game, \"Graveyard of Alderaan\" (part of \"\"). It describes how, after the Clone Wars, Alderaan's massive war machine was dismantled, and the weapons were placed aboard an armory warship called \"Another Chance\". The ship was programmed to continually jump through hyperspace until called home by the Alderanian Council. Bill Slavicsek, who wrote the game's sourcebook, later drew from it for his edition of \"A Guide to the Star Wars Universe\".\n\nIn the Dark Horse comic \"Dark Empire\" (1991–1992), New Alderaan is a Rebel Alliance colony planet populated by Alderaanians who were off-world when Alderaan was destroyed. Mon Mothma's daughter lives there.\n\nIn Alan Dean Foster's 1976 , Alderaan is described as a \"small green gem of a world\".\nThe planet appears more substantially in \"Star Wars\" reference guides to fictional locations. According to Kevin J. Anderson's \"The Illustrated Star Wars Universe\" (1995) and Wallace, Kolins and McKinney's \"Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons\" (1998), Alderaan is covered by wild grasslands, plains, forests and mountain ranges. The planet has no ocean, but has a semi-frozen polar sea, and thousands of lakes and rivers. It is rich in biodiversity, populated by a wide variety of flora and fauna, such as the nerf and the thranta.\n\nHuman life on the planet is evidenced by a number of cities, built to harmonize with the natural environment such as on canyon walls, on stilts along the shoreline or under the polar ice. The capital city, Aldera, has been built on a small island in the center of a caldera. The Alderaanian people value arts and education highly, and place high importance on their participation in the Galactic (later Imperial) Senate and the promotion of peace through demilitarization. The largely democratic society is formed as hereditary constitutional monarchy, ruled by the King or Queen of Alderaan from the Royal House of Antilles and later, due to marriage, the House of Organa. The planetary government is the High Council of Alderaan, presided over by a First Chairman and Viceroy.\n\nThe destruction of Alderaan is considered by some as an artistic depiction of the danger of nuclear weapons during the Cold War and some claim it is used as a example of inadequate political and military action leading to negative effects.\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n\n"}

It is sometimes called \"alkathene\" or \"polythene\" when used for HDPE pipes. With a high strength-to-density ratio, HDPE is used in the production of plastic bottles, corrosion-resistant piping, geomembranes and plastic lumber. HDPE is commonly recycled, and has the number \"2\" as its resin identification code.\n\nIn 2007, the global HDPE market reached a volume of more than 30 million tons.\n\nHDPE is known for its high strength-to-density ratio. The density of HDPE can range from 930 to 970 kg/m. Although the density of HDPE is only marginally higher than that of low-density polyethylene, HDPE has little branching, giving it stronger intermolecular forces and tensile strength than LDPE. The difference in strength exceeds the difference in density, giving HDPE a higher specific strength. It is also harder and more opaque and can withstand somewhat higher temperatures (120 °C/248 °F for short periods). High-density polyethylene, unlike polypropylene, cannot withstand normally required autoclaving conditions. The lack of branching is ensured by an appropriate choice of catalyst (e.g., Ziegler–Natta catalysts) and reaction conditions.\n\nHDPE is resistant to many different solvents.\n\nThe physical properties of HDPE can vary depending on the molding process that is used to manufacture a specific sample; to some degree a determining factor are the international standardized testing methods employed to identify these properties for a specific process. For example, in Rotational Molding, to identify the environmental stress crack resistance of a sample, the Notched Constant Tensile Load Test (NCTL) is put to use.\n\nOwing to these desirable properties, pipes constructed out of HDPE are ideally applicable for potable water, and waste water (storm and sewage).\n\nHDPE has a wide variety of applications:\n\nHDPE is also used for cell liners in sanitary landfills, wherein large sheets of HDPE are either extrusion welded or wedge welded to form a homogeneous chemical-resistant barrier, with the intention of preventing the pollution of soil and groundwater by the liquid constituents of solid waste.\n\nHDPE is preferred by the pyrotechnics trade for mortars over steel or PVC tubes, being more durable and safer: HDPE tends to rip or tear in a malfunction instead of shattering and becoming shrapnel like the other materials.\n\nMilk bottles, jugs, and other hollow goods manufactured through blow molding are the most important application area for HDPE, accounting for one-third of worldwide production, or more than 8 million tonnes.\n\nAbove all, China, where beverage bottles made from HDPE were first imported in 2005, is a growing market for rigid HDPE packaging, as a result of its improving standard of living. In India and other highly populated, emerging nations, infrastructure expansion includes the deployment of pipes and cable insulation made from HDPE. The material has benefited from discussions about possible health and environmental problems caused by PVC and polycarbonate associated bisphenol A (BPA), as well as its advantages over glass, metal, and cardboard.\n"}

The first recorded permanent white settler in northern Colorado, he founded the town of Laporte in 1858.\n\nJanis was born in Missouri to a French father and a mulatto mother. As a young man, in his early years Antoine traveled with his father on trading caravans from Missouri to the Green River. In 1836 he may have traveled with his father on a caravan along the Cache la Poudre River valley in present-day Larimer County. It is possible but not established that the river obtained its name during this trip. \n\nIn 1844 he journeyed west on his own, working with brother Nicholas as a scout and interpreter out of Fort Laramie, where he married First Elk Woman of the Oglala Sioux tribe. While returning from a trip to Mexico, he passed through present-day Colorado along the Poudre Valley, arriving at the spot where the Poudre emerges from the foothills. He was particularly taken by the valley, calling it \"the loveliest spot on earth.\" At the time, the area was not open to settlement but was part of the hunting territory of the Arapaho and Cheyenne. Janis staked out a squatter's claim on the river bottom just west of present-day Laporte, in June 1844; with the expectation of returning to homestead there once it was possible to legally file the claim. \n\nThe opening up of the western Nebraska Territory to homesteading allowed Janis to return to the area 1858 with his claim filed. He was accompanied by a party of other homesteaders from Fort Laramie, including John B. Provost, his brothers Francis and Nicholas Janis, Antoine LeBeau, Tood Randall, E.W. Raymond, B. Goodman, Laroque Bosquet (aka: Rock Bush) and Oliver Morrisette. His arrival to the area with his wife came one year before the flood of prospectors in the 1859 Colorado Gold Rush. Janis settled in the area with approximately 150 lodges of Arapaho, who accompanied him to the spot. With the other members of his party, he founded the town of Colona, which later became Laporte, the first white community in Larimer County. The following year he erected a small wooden house on the south side of Poudre River where he kept a grocery and saloon. \n\nHe continued to live in the area until 1878, when a general order from the federal government forced his wife to move to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Janis sold his cabin and accompanied his wife to the reservation, where he died in 1890.\n\nIn 1939, Janis' wooden homestead cabin was moved from Laporte to its present location adjacent to the Fort Collins Museum and Discovery Science Center in Fort Collins. The cabin is part of the museum grounds open to the public and has been partially restored for tours.\n\n"}

It is also one of the oldest karate organizations continuously in operation until the present.\n\nGichin Funakoshi played a major role in introducing karate from Okinawa to Japan, adjusted to reduce injury and merged with approaches for athletic training. On May 27, 1949, some of his senior students including Isao Obata, Masatoshi Nakayama, and Hidetaka Nishiyama, formed a karate organization dedicated to research, promotion, events management, and education: the Japan Karate Association. Funakoshi, then around 80 years old, held a position equivalent to chief instructor emeritus, with Nakayama as the chief instructor.\n\nThe JKA emerged from karate clubs at Japanese universities located in the Tokyo region. Most of these universities, however, distanced themselves from the JKA during the 1950s. Takushoku University always kept strong ties with the JKA, being the \"alma mater\" of many of the senior JKA instructors, such as Nakayama, Nishiyama, Okazaki, Asai, Kanazawa, and Enoeda, who were responsible for the JKA's consolidation during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nGeneral uneasiness on how karate was taught by the JKA instructors and disagreements on Funakoshi's funeral arrangements in 1957 motivated some of the senior karateka connected with Funakoshi, but not associated with the JKA, such as Shigeru Egami, Genshin Hironishi, and Tsutomu Ohshima, to form their own organizations, such as Shotokai and Shotokan Karate of America). They claimed to practice a version of Shotokan karate closer to what Funakoshi taught, as compared to the JKA style. The JKA Shotokan approach is also based on Funakoshi's karate, but with significant adaptations introduced mostly by Nakayama, who was JKA chief instructor until his death in 1987. Under Nakayama's leadership, a generation of respected instructors spread karate worldwide, guided from the JKA headquarters in Tokyo.\n\nNakayama's books, which include \"Dynamic Karate\" and the \"Best Karate\" series, are fundamental reference materials on Shotokan karate as practiced under the JKA. Clive Nicol, in his classic book \"Moving Zen\", describes the karate practice at the JKA's \"honbu dojo\" (headquarters training hall) in Tokyo during the early 1960s, from his unique perspective as a western karate student going from white to black belt in a few years.\n\nThe JKA experienced several divisions from the 1970s onwards. Notable splinter groups formed as follows:\n\n\nDue to these divisions, there is today the notion of a separate JKA karate style—that is, Shotokan karate that follows the JKA tradition to a large extent, but is taught by instructors who are not officially affiliated with JKA (though most of them are former JKA instructors and graduates).\n\nIn 1956, the JKA started its \"kenshusei\" instructor intern training program at the JKA \"honbu dojo\", in Yotsuya, Tokyo, which had been built in 1955. This program was instituted by Masatoshi Nakayama. The training program has promoted the consistency and quality control of JKA training practices over the years, graduating some of the world's most well known \"karateka\" (practitioners of karate), as listed below.\n\nThe following table lists JKA \"kenshusei\" training program graduates in order of year of graduation. The reported rank of graduates no longer with the JKA is that from their current organization. Such rank is not necessarily recognized by the JKA.\n\nThis list is incomplete. For instance, it does not include some members who were expelled or resigned from the JKA see below:\n\n\nThe list at the JKA's website, which includes most members who left or were expelled, may also be incomplete. The JKA has not included some former members who have completed the course and are not currently affiliated with JKA. In addition, during the troubled period between 1990 and 1999 each JKA faction held its own instructors' course. Currently, the JKA does not recognize graduates from the instructors' courses led by the JKS (Japan Karate Shoto Renmei, which also held the name JKA between 1990 and 1999).\n\n\"Karateka\" such as Dave Hazard (UK), Ennio Vezzuli (Brazil), Nigel Jackson (South Africa), Peté Pacheco (Portugal), Malcolm Fisher (Canada), Leon Montoya (Colombia), Richard Amos (UK, US), Pascal Lesage (France) and others, are mentioned in karate forums as having completed the JKA instructors' course (or having had substantial participation in it) but do not appear on the list of graduates as published in 2008 on the JKA's website.\n\nIn addition, the list does not include graduate instructors from the instructor programmes of splinter groups such as JKS and KWF, examples being \nNorio Kawasaki (KWF - Japan) \nMasamichi Otsuka (KWF - Japan)\nYutaka Koike (JKS - Japan) \nYasuhisa Inada (JKS - Japan) \nScott Langley (JKS - Ireland) \nKyle Kamal Helou (JKS - Lebanon) \nTakeo Matsui (JKS- Japan)\nTakuya Makita (JKS - Japan)\n\nAlthough Gichin Funakoshi wrote that there are no contests in Karate, Nakayama Masatoshi teachings led to more scientific and competitive approach to the training and in 1957 the first All Japan Karate Championship was held, and has been held annually since.\n\nIn addition, the JKA has organised a number of international tournaments amongst which the following have been considered to be the JKA's World Championships:\n\n"}

In the past it also operated long-haul flights to destinations including Thailand, India, and Indonesia as well as the Caribbean. Its main base and hub of operations is Stockholm Arlanda Airport, but the airline also operates from Oslo Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Gothenburg Landvetter Airport and Billund Airport. The airline is currently owned by the German corporation DER Touristik which is a part of the REWE Group, and employs approximately 70 pilots and 245 cabin crew to operate their current fleet of Airbus A321neo aircraft.\n\nNovair was established and started operations in November 1997 with services from Stockholm to Phuket, Thailand and the Canary Islands of Spain on behalf of Apollo, a Swedish travel agency. In 1998, the airline began operating three more Lockheed L-1011 TriStar to destinations in the Far East and the Caribbean, and placed an order for three new Boeing 737-800NG to operate destinations in the Mediterranean and Canary Islands. The airline replaced the L-1011 TriStar with two Airbus A330-200 and leased one from Swissair. \n\nAfter the September 11 Attacks, Novair was forced to ground one of its Airbus A330-200 due to lack of demand, and leased out the aircraft to a Libyan company. In 2003, Novair took over the Cuban airline Cubana's flights from Cuba to destinations such as London, Madrid and Paris. The airline also replaced their Boeing fleet with new Airbus A321-200. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Novair were the first Swedish airline to arrive with relief supplies and doctors, and to evacuate tourists. Novair also briefly leased an aircraft to Air Madrid in 2006, however due to their bankruptcy, the aircraft was returned and was instead leased to Kuwait Airways in 2007. When the aircraft was returned from Kuwait, it was parked in Zurich to be stored, thus ending all A330 operations.\n\nIn 2009, Novair became the first and only Scandinavian airline to undertake EU project SESAR, and also participated in the MINT-Project to fly \"green approaches\", also known as continuous descent approaches to reduce fuel burn and noise. Novair also leased an Airbus A330-200 from Orbest and from Air Europa, to be operated with a cockpit crew from respective airline, and a Novair cabin crew. Between 2013 and 2014, Novair leased an Airbus A330-200 from Aer Lingus using the same crew composition, to operate their long-haul destinations.

A veteran of the American Revolution, Haynes was the first black man in the United States to be ordained as a minister.\n\nHaynes was a native of West Hartford, Connecticut, and was the son of an African American man and a white woman. He spent much of his childhood as an indentured servant in the house of a Granville, Massachusetts farmer. A regular churchgoer, he began to preach as a boy. He served in the militia during the American Revolution, including garrison duty at the recently captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. Haynes also became an anti-slavery activist. In addition to arguing against involuntary servitude and preaching against the slave trade, Haynes also advocated against the colonization movement, arguing that people of African descent living in the United States should be entitled to the same rights as other citizens, and that having them resettle in Africa would not be beneficial.\n\nOrdained in the Congregational church in 1785, Haynes pastored a church in Torrington, Connecticut for three years. In 1788, Haynes accepted a call to pastor the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now West Rutland's United Church of Christ), where he remained for the next 30 years. He then moved to a temporary pastorate at Manchester, Vermont, and finally to South Granville, New York, where he was pastor of South Granville Congregational Church.\n\nHaynes died in South Granville in 1833, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville.\n\nHaynes was born on July 18, 1753 in West Hartford, Connecticut, reportedly to a Caucasian mother of some status and an unknown man was African or African-American. The identity of Haynes's mother has long been the subject of debate among historians and theologians. The most prevalent theory is that she was a servant named Lucy or Alice Fitch who worked for the John Haynes family of West Hartford. Another theory suggests that Fitch was a stand-in, willing or unwilling, for his real mother. According to this theory, Haynes's mother was a member of the prominent Goodwin family of Hartford who tried to avoid the scandal associated with giving birth while unmarried by staying with the Haynes family. Both theories suggest that Lucy (or Alice) Fitch was fired by the Haynes family after she attested to or was accused of being the mother. She named her son Haynes, either to give him respectability or to take revenge against the Hayneses for firing her.\n\nAt the age of five months, Lemuel Haynes was given over to indentured servitude to Deacon David Rose, a blind farmer of Granville, Massachusetts. Part of the indenture required Rose to see to Haynes's education, and by accompanying Rose to church, he became exposed to Calvinistic religious doctrine, including the works of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and Philip Doddridge, who all became strong influences on Haynes' religious outlook. According to Haynes, while David Rose fulfilled his indenture obligations to Haynes, Rose's wife Elizabeth (Fowler) Haynes (d. 1775) was especially devoted to his upbringing, to the point of treating him as though he was her own child.\n\nFreed in 1774 when his indenture expired, Haynes joined the minutemen of Granville. In 1775, he marched with his militia company to Roxbury, Massachusetts, following the news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1776, he accompanied them in the garrisoning of the recently captured Fort Ticonderoga. He remained on garrison duty until contracting Typhus, which caused him to return home.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Haynes began to write extensively, criticizing the slave trade and slavery. He continued these activities after the war, and also began to prepare sermons, family prayers and other theological works. The Scripture, abolitionism, and republicanism affected his published writings, in which Haynes argued that slavery denied black people their natural rights to \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness\". Paralleling the recent American experience with oppression to the slave experience, Haynes wrote: \"Liberty is equally as precious to a black man, as it is to a white one, and bondage as equally as intolerable to the one as it is to the other\".\n\nAfter his militia service, Haynes studied theology with members of the clergy in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He received his license to preach in 1780, along with a position as temporary 'supply' to his home congregation in Middle Granville. About the same time, he began his many years of service as a missionary in the wilderness of the New Hampshire Grants, soon to be known as the independent Vermont Republic and finally the American state of Vermont.\n\nHaynes was ordained in 1785 and settled at Hemlock Congregational Church in Torrington, Connecticut. He was the first African American ordained in the United States. On March 28, 1788, Haynes left his pastorate at Torrington to accept a call at the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now West Rutland's United Church of Christ), where he served the mostly white congregation for 30 years.\n\nHaynes continued to write and speak about slavery. His contemporary white republican and abolitionist thinkers did see slavery as a liability to the new country, but most argued for eventual slave expatriation to Africa. The American Colonization Society (founded in 1817) was the largest colonization group. Included among its supporters were people such as James Madison, James Monroe, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. The ACS was strongly supported in Vermont. In contrast, Haynes continued to passionately argue along Calvinist lines that God's providential plan would defeat slavery and lead to the harmonious integration of the races as equals.\n\nAfter asking for and accepting dismissal from West Rutland in 1818, he took a temporary post at Manchester. His final pastorate was in South Granville, New York where he was minister of the South Granville Congregational Church from 1822 to 1833.\n\nHaynes died in South Granville, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville. He had composed his own epitaph, which was included on his gravestone as he had requested.\n\nWhile living in Middle Granville in the early 1780s, Haynes met and married Elizabeth Babbitt (1763-1836), a white schoolteacher. Their children included:\n\nMiddlebury College granted Haynes an honorary master of arts in 1804, the first honorary degree ever bestowed upon an African American.\n\nHistorian John Saillant (2003, p. 3) writes that Haynes's \"faith and social views are better documented than those of any African American born before the luminaries of the mid-nineteenth century.\"\n\nThe Lemuel Haynes House, Hayne's home in South Granville, New York when he was pastor of the South Granville Congregational Church, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. In 2009, it was purchased from Charles Halderman by Bo Young and William Foote, formerly of Brooklyn.\n\n\n"}

Each node of the tree has a one-bit flag denoting \"go left to find a pseudo-LRU element\" or \"go right to find a pseudo-LRU element\". To find a pseudo-LRU element, traverse the tree according to the values of the flags. To update the tree with an access to an item N, traverse the tree to find N and, during the traversal, set the node flags to denote the direction that is opposite to the direction taken.\n\nThis algorithm can be sub-optimal since it is an approximation. For example, in the above diagram with A, C, B, D cache lines, if the access pattern was: C, B, D, A, on an eviction we would chose B instead of C. This is because both A and C are in the same half and accessing A directs the algorithm to the other half that does not contain cache line C.\n\nBit-PLRU stores one status bit for each cache line. These bits are called MRU-bits. Every access to a line sets its MRU-bit to 1, indicating that the\nline was recently used. Whenever the last remaining 0 bit of a set's status bits is\nset to 1, all other bits are reset to 0. At cache misses, the line with lowest index whose MRU-bit is 0 is replaced.\n\n"}

Linola was developed in the early 1990s by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It was developed and released in Australia in 1992 and first commercially grown in 1994. Australian Linola varieties are named after Australian lakes. \n\nThis variety was developed to provide a source of edible linseed oil with a low alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content of approximately 2%, as compared to 50% in the wild type variety. It was done to improve the storage quality of linseed when used as a bulk livestock feed. Linseed's previous main use had been linseed oil for use as a paint ingredient, with the ALA (omega-3 fatty acid) being a quick drying component. With the advent of \"plastic\" water-based paints, the linseed market fell into decline, but when marketed as a stock feed, the omega-3 content also deteriorated quickly in storage. Compared to normal linseed, linola has a lower level of ALA, which increases the oxidative stability of the oil/seed, which means it remains edible much longer when stored. Linola has a correspondingly higher content of the linoleic acid, omega-6 fatty acid, around 65% to 75%. The seed colour was also changed from the wild type dark brown seed to a light yellow seed, which consequently gives an oil of a light colour, easily distinguished from the darker linseed oil. \n\nLinola oil likely has the same functional food and health benefits as linseed oil. Linola is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Linola can specially help against neurodermatitis. (No published scientific evidence was found to support this claim.) \n\nLinola substitutes for flax in cropping rotations; it is claimed to have lower production costs than canola, but brings prices comparable to canola or other edible oils. Linola is produced in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and in the U.S. states of Washington and Idaho. All Canadian cultivars of Linola were deregistered for sale and use as of August 1st, 2013. \n"}

{"id": "1911723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911723", "title": "Telopea speciosissima", "text": "Telopea speciosissima\n\nTelopea speciosissima, commonly known as the New South Wales waratah or simply waratah, is a large shrub in the plant family Proteaceae. It is endemic to New South Wales in Australia and is the floral emblem of that state. No subspecies are recognised, but the closely related \"Telopea aspera\" was only recently classified as a separate species.\n\n\"T. speciosissima\" is a shrub to high and wide, with dark green leaves. Its several stems arise from a pronounced woody base known as a lignotuber. The species is well renowned for its striking large red springtime inflorescences (flowerheads), each including hundreds of individual flowers. These are visited by the eastern pygmy possum (\"Cercartetus nanus\"), birds such as honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and various insects.\n\nThe floral emblem for its home state of New South Wales, \"Telopea speciosissima\" has featured prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with \"T. oreades\" and \"T. mongaensis\" which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.\n\n\"Telopea speciosissima\", the New South Wales waratah, is a large, erect shrub up to in height with one or more stems. Arising vertically or near vertically from a large woody base, or lignotuber, the stems are little branched. In late spring, there is a spurt of new growth after flowering, with new shoots often arising from old flowerheads. The dark green leaves are alternate and usually coarsely-toothed, ranging from in length. Enveloped in leafy bracts, the flowerheads develop over the winter and begin to swell in early spring, before opening to reveal the striking inflorescences. The exact timing varies across New South Wales, but flowering can begin as early as August in the northern parts of its range, and finish in November in the southern, more elevated areas. Spot flowering may also occur around March in autumn. Containing up to 250 individual flowers, the domed flowerheads are crimson in colour and measure in diameter. They are cupped in a whorl of leafy bracts which are long and also red. Variations are not uncommon; some flowerheads may be more globular or cone-shaped than dome-shaped, and the bracts may be whitish or dark red. The tips of the stigmas of some inflorescences may be whitish, contrasting with the red colour of the rest of the flowerhead.\n\nAn individual flowerhead reaches full size about two weeks after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another two weeks before the flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma at the end of the style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.\n\nThe seed pods grow to long. As the pods mature, they range from green, to yellow and finally turn russet red-brown. The pods become leathery before splitting open during early winter. The pods contain winged seeds inside. In the wild, only two or three seed pods develop per flowerhead, but there may be anywhere from 5 to 50 in cultivated plants.\n\n\"Telopea speciosissima\", the New South Wales Waratah, was first described by botanist James Edward Smith in his 1793 book \"A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland\", from \"very fine dried specimens sent by Mr. White\". He gave the species its original binomial name of \"Embothrium speciosissimum\". The specific epithet is derived from the superlative of the Latin word \"speciosus\" \"beautiful\" or \"handsome\", hence \"very-\" or \"most beautiful\". \"Embothrium\" had been a wastebasket taxon at the time, and Robert Brown suggested the genus \"Telopea\" for it in 1809, which was published in 1810. Richard Salisbury had published the name \"Hylogyne speciosa\" in 1809, but Brown's name was nomenclaturally conserved.\n\n\"Telopea speciosissima\" is one of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus \"Telopea\". Its closest relative is the very similar Gibraltar Range waratah (\"T. aspera\") from northern New South Wales, which was only recognised as a separate species in 1995, having previously been considered an unusual northern population of \"T. speciosissima\".\n\nThe genus is classified in the subtribe Embothriinae of the Proteaceae, along with the tree waratahs (\"Alloxylon\") from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and \"Oreocallis\" and the Chilean firetree (\"Embothrium coccineum\") from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance must predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago.\n\nAlthough no subspecies are recognised within \"Telopea speciosissima\" itself, geographical variations within its range have been noted. Forms toward the northern limits of its range have more prominently lobed leaves. A population from Waterfall has darker red, wider inflorescences, and a population at West Head in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park has paler inflorescences. Leaf shape varies widely.\n\nThe common name \"waratah\" was first applied to this species before being generalised to other members of the genus \"Telopea\" and, to a lesser extent, \"Alloxylon\". \"Waratah\" is derived from the Eora Aboriginal people, the original inhabitants of the Sydney area. The Dharawal people of the Illawarra region knew it as \"mooloone\", and \"mewah\" is another aboriginal name. A former common name from around 1900 is \"native tulip\", possibly derived from \"Telopea\".\n\nThe species is found in New South Wales (Australia) from the Watagan Mountains southward to Ulladulla, with a relatively widespread distribution in the Central Coast region. It usually occurs as an understory shrub in open forest on sandy soils in areas with moderately high rainfall, receiving on average around a year. Dappled shade from eucalyptus (\"Eucalyptus\") trees reduces sunlight by around 30%. Much of its range occurs in the Sydney Basin, an area with one of the highest human populations and most intense development in Australia. The impact of habitat fragmentation and decreased fire interval (time between bushfires) on the gene pool of \"Telopea speciosissima\", which relies on outcrossing, is unclear. Although largely protected within National Parks and conservation reserves in the Sydney area, most populations are small, numbering under 200 plants, and are often located near urban developments.\n\n\"Telopea speciosissima\" is a pyrogenic-flowering species, relying on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, it is one of the slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (\"Banksia\") and wattles (\"Acacia\"). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.\nThe prominent position and striking colour of \"Telopea speciosissima\" and many of its relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae both in Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. Honeyeaters, in particular the New Holland honeyeater (\"Phylidonyris novaehollandiae\") and the crescent honeyeater (\"P. pyrrhopterus\"), are frequent visitors. However, a field study conducted at Barren Grounds showed New Holland honeyeaters to carry relatively little pollen. The eastern pygmy possum (\"Cercartetus nanus\") also forages among the flowerheads.\n\nThe New South Wales waratah had been considered to be protandrous (that is, with male parts concluding sexual activity before female parts become receptive on the same plant), but analysis of the timing of pollen viability and stigma receptivity has shown significant overlaps. The species has been shown to be self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination with plants of other genotypes to reproduce successfully.\n\nThe New South Wales waratah was a popular garden plant at the beginning of the 20th century. It had been introduced early (1789) into the United Kingdom, and was reported flowering for the first time in 1809 at Springwell, the villa of one E. J. A. Woodford Esq. The Royal Horticultural Society awarded it an Award of Merit in 1914, and a First Class Certificate in 1922.\n\nInitially, waratahs were picked from the bushland for market, but by the early 20th century, a few plantsmen grew concerned at the development of urban areas at the expense of bush, particularly areas noted for wildflowers. Percy Parry of Floralands in Kariong developed the idea of \"Preservation by Cultivation\" and investigated the commercial cultivation of waratahs and other native plants. Meanwhile, the New South Wales Government was looking to curb flower and plant collecting from the wild, and considered prohibition in 1944, but after witnessing the ability of Parry to manage and develop cultivation, introduced compulsory licences for wildflower collecting the following year. With his wife Olive, Percy promoted and developed knowledge over fifty years and received the Order of Australia medal in 1981. Following on from the Parrys were Howard Gay and Arch Dennis, who pioneered growing waratahs at Monbulk in the Dandenong Ranges in the 1940s, Sid Cadwell and Frank Stone, who did likewise in Dural and the Blue Mountains respectively. The growing movement for cultivating and preserving native plants led to the establishment of the Society for Growing Australian Plants in 1957, and the waratah was featured heavily in the first edition of its journal \"Australian Plants\".\n\nToday, New South Wales waratahs are grown commercially in Australia north of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. They are also grown commercially in New Zealand and in Israel, and also in Hawaii, where they have been grown since 1961. One major challenge in commercial production is that in any one location the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. The vase life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water.\n\nAlthough they grow naturally on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates the plants and promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.\n\nSeveral species of fungi infect the roots of waratahs, causing significant plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part or all of the plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\", which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. \"Rhizoctonia solani\" can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. \"Cylindrocarpon scoparium\" and \"C. destructans\" (now \"Nectria radicicola\") are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi are less likely to be the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.\n\nThe larvae of the Macadamia leafminer (\"Acrocercops chionosema\"), a moth, burrow along and disfigure the waratah's leaves, and are mainly a problem in lowering the value of cut flower crops. More problematic is the larger caterpillar of another moth, the Macadamia twig girdler Macadamia twig girdler (\"Xylorycta luteotactella\") which can burrow into and disfigure the developing flowerhead.\n\nA number of natural variants of \"Telopea speciosissima\" have been selected for cultivation as follows:\n\n\nIn addition, a number of interspecific \"Telopea\" hybrids have also been produced. These have been bred or used as more frost- or shade-tolerant plants in cooler climates such as Canberra, Melbourne or elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales waratah featured prominently in the folklore of the Darug and Tharawal people in the Sydney basin and Gandangara people to the southwest. A dreamtime legend from the Eora tells of a female wonga pigeon searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. A hawk attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles in the bush her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the Burragorang Valley tells of a beautiful maiden named Krubi, who wore a red cloak of rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the gang-gang cockatoo. She fell in love with a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering.\n\nThe striking form of the New South Wales waratah became a popular motif in Australian art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and was incorporated in art nouveau designs of the time. Matchboxes, paperweights and especially tins have been decorated with the flower. Arnott's often used the waratah as an alternative to their parrot logo on biscuit and cake tins from the early 1900s. Shelleys soft drinks, established in 1893 in Broken Hill, also displayed it on their label. The French artist Lucien Henry, who had settled in Sydney in 1879, was a strong proponent of a definitive Australian art style incorporating local flora, particularly the waratah. His most famous surviving work is a triptych stained glass window of Oceania flanked by numerous waratahs overlooking the Centennial Hall in Sydney Town Hall.\n\nIn 1925, artist Margaret Preston produced a hand-coloured woodcut depicting waratahs. The species also appeared on an Australian 3 shilling stamp in 1959 designed by botanical illustrator Margaret Jones and a 30c stamp in 1968.\n\nThe Sydney suburb of Telopea takes its name from the Waratah, as does the Newcastle suburb of Waratah and the Super Rugby team, the Sydney-based NSW Waratahs.\n\nAfter Australian federation in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle \"Acacia pycnantha\", and debate raged between proponents of the two flowers. The economist and botanist R. T. Baker proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence of its flowers. He was nicknamed the \"Commander in Chief of the Waratah Armed Forces\". The South Australian \"Evening News\" also supported the bid, but to no avail.\n\nDecades later, in 1962, \"Telopea speciosissima\" was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of New South Wales by the then-governor Sir Eric Woodward, after being used informally for many years. The species has also been adopted by others, including the New South Wales Waratahs rugby union team since the 1880s, and the former department store Grace Bros in a stylised form for their logo\nin the 1980s. Contemporary clothing designers Jenny Kee and Linda Jackson produced waratah-inspired fabric designs in the 1970s and 1980s during a resurgence of Australian motifs.\n\nFrom 1956 the annual Waratah Festival was held in Sydney, run by the Sydney Committee. It took place from late October to early November, coinciding with the blooming of the waratahs. It was an important cultural event which included a parade, a popular art competition, beauty contests, exhibitions and performances. A highlight was the Lord Mayor's reception at the Sydney Town Hall for which the floral displays were made of hundreds of waratahs culled by Park Rangers from the national parks.\n\nIn 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, Nathan Rees, commissioned a state logo based on the floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather than the New South Wales Waratah.\n\n\n"}

The concept takes its origin from Marcus Garvey's 1924 poem \"Hail, United States of Africa\".\n\nThe idea of a multinational unifying African state has been compared to various medieval African empires, including the Ethiopian Empire, the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, the Songhai Empire, the Benin Empire, the Kanem Empire, and other historic nation states. During the late 19th and early 20th century the majority of African land was controlled by various European empires, with the British controlling around 30 per cent of the African population at its peak.\n\nThe term \"United States of Africa\" was mentioned first by Marcus Garvey in his poem \"Hail, United States of Africa\" in 1924. Garvey's ideas and formation systems deeply influenced former Africa leaders and the rebirth of the African Union. \n\nIn February 2009, upon being elected chairman of the 53-nation African Union in Ethiopia, Gaddafi told the assembled African leaders: \"I shall continue to insist that our sovereign countries work to achieve the United States of Africa.\" The BBC reported that Gaddafi had proposed \"a single African military force, a single currency and a single passport for Africans to move freely around the continent\". Other African leaders stated they would study the proposal's implications, and re-discuss it in May 2009.\n\nThe focus for developing the United States of Africa so far has been on building subdivisions of Africa - the proposed East African Federation can be seen as an example of this. Former President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, had indicated that the United States of Africa could exist from as early as 2017. The African Union, by contrast, has set itself the task of building a \"united and integrated\" Africa by 2025. Gaddafi had also indicated that the proposed federation may extend as far west as the Caribbean: Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and other islands featuring a large African diaspora, may be invited to join.\n\nGaddafi also received criticism for his involvement in the movement, and lack of support for the idea from among other African leaders. A week before Gaddafi's death during the Libyan Civil War, South African President Jacob Zuma expressed relief at the regime's downfall, complaining that Gaddafi had been \"intimidating\" many African heads of state and government in an effort to gain influence throughout the continent and suggesting that the African Union will function better without Gaddafi and his repeated proposals for a unitary African government.\n\nGaddafi was ultimately killed during the Battle of Sirte in October 2011. While some regard the project to have died with him, Robert Mugabe expressed interest in reviving the project. Following the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état, Mugabe resigned as President. On 6 September 2019, Mugabe died.\n\nThe nations of Eritrea, Ghana, Senegal, and Zimbabwe, have supported an African federation. Others such as South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria have been more skeptical, feeling that the continent is not ready for integration. North African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, and post-revolution Libya who have traditionally identified more with rival ideologies like Arab nationalism, Berberism and Islamism have shown less interest in the idea.\n\nSupport appears to be inversely proportional to a nation's power and influence. Doubts have been raised about whether the goal of a unified Africa can ever be achieved while ongoing problems of conflict and poverty persist throughout the continent.\n\nThe proposed federation would have the largest total territory of any state, exceeding the Russian Federation. It would also be the third most populous state after China and India, and with a population speaking an estimated 2,000 languages.\n\nIn the fictional \"Star Trek\" universe, the United States of Africa exist as part of the United Earth Government. Commander Uhura and Lieutenant Commander La Forge originate from Kenya and Somalia respectively, both within the United States of Africa.\n\nIn the fictional \"Halo\" universe, the United States of Africa exist as a nation of the United Earth Government, within the United Nations Space Command.\n\nArthur C. Clarke's 1987 science fiction novel \"\" features the formation of a United States of Southern Africa.\n\nThe 2006 French-Beninese film \"Africa Paradis\" is set in the United States of Africa in the year 2033.\n\nThe 1990s cartoon \"Bots Master\" has a United States of Africa, and its President is one of the few people who believes that Ziv \"ZZ\" Zulander is not a terrorist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1911744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911744", "title": "Dead man zone", "text": "Dead man zone\n\nThe dead man zone is the area directly around a bushfire that is likely to burn within five minutes given the current wind conditions or an anticipated change in wind direction. The distance this zone extends from the firefront is highly dependent on terrain, windspeed, fuel type and composition, relative humidity and ambient temperature, and can range from under 100 m to well over 1 km.\n\nThe term \"dead man zone\" was coined by members of the CSIRO research team in Australia who were investigating the spread of bushfires (Project Vesta). Project Vesta, headed by scientist Phil Cheney, found that when the wind changes direction, the line of fire will move out at its maximum rate of spread almost immediately, and that that speed was nearly three times what was previously thought.\nProject Vesta's research into bushfire behaviour makes up the majority of what is known about bushfires today.\n\nOutcomes from Project Vesta have been integrated into firefighter training in Australia, and are beginning to appear in the United States.\n\nFirefighters try to stay out of the dead man zone at all times, working from safe points such as burnt ground or a large area of non-burnable ground, such as a cricket or Australian rules football oval, or a large car park. This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. (Were they to attack fires at the head of the fire, they risk having spot fires start behind them. They would also risk changes in wind behaviour accelerating the spread of the fire.) \n\nThe result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone, and that they should always keep 250 litres of water in their truck for personal safety. This is now a standard operating procedure in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Country Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Australia.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation, as part of a duopoly with MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WDCA (channel 20). The two stations share studios and transmitter facilities on Wisconsin Avenue in the Friendship Heights neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of Washington.\n\nOn cable, WTTG is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 25 in Washington, D.C. (cable channel 5 is occupied by an alternate feed of MASN) and channel 5 in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs, and on Cox Communications, RCN and Verizon FiOS channel 5.\n\nThe station's signal is rebroadcast on a low-powered digital translator station, W24ES-D, in Moorefield, West Virginia (which is owned by Valley TV Cooperative, Inc.).\n\nThe station traces its history to May 19, 1945, when television set and equipment manufacturer Allen B. DuMont founded W3XWT, the second experimental station in the nation's capital (after NBC's W3XNB, forerunner to WRC-TV). Later in 1945, DuMont Laboratories began a series of experimental coaxial cable hookups between W3XWT and its other television station, WABD (now WNYW) in New York City. These hookups were the beginning of the DuMont Television Network, the world's first licensed commercial television network. DuMont began regular network service in 1946. Almost a year later on January 3, 1947, W3XWT received a commercial license – the first in the nation's capital – as WTTG. The station was named for Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr., the DuMont Network's chief engineer and a close friend of Dr. DuMont.\n\nLike WABD and DuMont's other owned-and-operated station, WDTV in Pittsburgh, WTTG was far more successful than the network as a whole. In 1956, after DuMont shut down network operations, WTTG and WABD became independent stations and were spun off from DuMont Laboratories as the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation (WDTV was sold to Westinghouse Electric Corporation the previous year; it is now CBS owned-and-operated station KDKA-TV). DuMont later changed its name to Metropolitan Broadcasting in order to distance itself from its former parent company.\n\nIn 1958 Washington investor John Kluge bought controlling interest in Metropolitan Broadcasting from Paramount Pictures and installed himself as its chairman. He changed the company's name to Metromedia in 1961. Goldsmith sat on Metromedia's board of directors for over a quarter-century. Channel 5 gained a sister station on radio when Metromedia purchased WASH (97.1 FM) in 1968. At first, WTTG ran on a low budget. However, in the late 1960s, it benefited from Metromedia's aggressiveness in acquiring top syndicated programming, giving it a significant leg up on WDCA, which signed on in 1966.\n\nBy the 1970s WTTG was one of the leading independent stations in the country, running a broad lineup of cartoons, off-network sitcoms, first-run syndicated shows, older movies, local newscasts and locally produced programs. During this time period, and well into the early 1990s, WTTG was the flagship station for the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team as well as Big East Conference men's basketball. Its main claim to fame was \"Panorama\", an afternoon talk show hosted by Maury Povich and John Willis.\n\nWhen cable television began in the 1970s, WTTG became a regional superstation. At one point it appeared on every cable provider in Maryland and Virginia, as well as most of Delaware and in parts of West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nMetromedia owned the station until 1986 when Rupert Murdoch, after buying 20th Century Fox, purchased the Metromedia television stations to form the nucleus of the Fox network. WTTG became one of Fox's six original owned-and-operated stations when the network launched on October 9, 1986, all the while retaining consistently high ratings, a rarity for a Fox station in its early years of operation at the time, and continuing to easily out-rate WDCA and new competitor WCQR (channel 50, now WDCW). Initially, its programming was similar to what it had run as a true independent station, since Fox only programmed for a few hours on weekends in its early years (the network would not have a full seven-day schedule worth of programs until 1993).\n\nAs channel 5 transitioned to an O&O and more independent stations signed on, it lost much of its cable audience. Though not distributed as widely as it once was, it is still available on several cable providers in Maryland and Virginia outside the D.C. metro area. For instance, it is still carried on cable in Charlottesville, Virginia, even though the city has had its own Fox affiliate, WAHU-CD, since 2005; both stations are carried on basic cable in the Charlottesville area. It also served as the default Fox affiliate for Salisbury, Maryland until the debut of new default Fox affiliate, \"Fox21 Delmarva\", a subchannel of WBOC-TV, on August 21, 2006.\n\nDuring the 1990s the station added more syndicated talk shows and reality shows. It continued to air afternoon cartoons from Fox Kids until the fall of 2001, when the block moved to WDCA (only to be reduced to just Saturdays nationwide in 2002); WTTG reacquired Fox children's programming from WDCA later on in 2003, under the banners of FoxBox and 4Kids TV, and aired that block until it ended in December 2008. On October 29, 2001, Fox bought WDCA from Viacom's Paramount Stations Group, creating a duopoly with WTTG. The station continued to run top rated off-network sitcoms in the evenings.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2006 WTTG utilized the \"X-2 Package\" for its theme music, but switched to the \"O&O Package\" in 2006, which they still use today.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC (affiliated network of WJLA-TV, channel 7), announced its intent to buy WTTG's parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $66.1 billion; the sale, which closed on March 20, 2019, excluded WTTG and sister station WDCA as well as the Fox network, the MyNetworkTV programming service, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and the Fox Television Stations unit, which were all transferred to the newly-formed Fox Corporation.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWTTG shut down its analog signal over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 36. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 5.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, the FCC announced that sister station WDCA was a winner in the 2016–17 spectrum reallocation auction and in return receive $118,834,183 for the frequency. WDCA was scheduled to stop broadcasting its own signal over channel 35 no later than January 23, 2018, and continue over-the-air coverage by sharing WTTG's channel 36. The channel-sharing arrangement required WDCA and WTTG to drop one or more of their combined five subchannels; WDCA obtained a three-month extension from the original off-air deadline in order to avoid doing so for as long as possible. The deadline was later extended by 90 additional days, to July 22, 2018, which was the longest delay allowed by FCC rules; WDCA moved channels on July 18.\n\nWTTG clears the entire Fox schedule (including prime time, Saturday morning, sports programming, and Sunday news program \"Fox News Sunday\"). Syndicated programming currently on WTTG includes \"TMZ on TV\", \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"Extra\" and \"Judge Judy\" and among others.\n\nWTTG has been the primary station for the Washington Redskins since 1994, when Fox obtained the rights to air NFL games in which a team from the National Football Conference (which the Redskins are part of) played a road game. WTTG airs all Sunday afternoon Redskins games, unless the game is instead covered by the NFL's contract with CBS (in which case WUSA airs the game). This relationship is limited to network coverage of regular season and postseason games, since WRC-TV and NBC Sports Washington are the official broadcast partners for the team's ancillary programming; beginning in 2018, with Fox's purchase of the package, all \"Thursday Night Football\" games are aired on WTTG. Prior to 1994, when the Fox network established its sports division, WTTG aired the Redskins' preseason games and training camp scrimmages during the majority of the 1980s into the early 1990s. Since the league suspended its blackout policy in 2015, WTTG has never blacked out the team's home games, despite the team's issues since the mid-2010s with maintaining sellouts at FedExField.\n\nThe station also airs Washington Nationals games when they are featured on Fox's Major League Baseball telecasts, including the team's victory over the Houston Astros in the 2019 World Series, which marked the Fall Classic's return to the nation's capital after 86 years. Additionally, Channel 5 carries any Maryland Terrapins football and men's basketball games selected for broadcast by Fox through its agreement with the Big Ten Conference, plus Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball via the Big East Conference.\n\nIn 2004, the inner operations of WTTG during the station's first years under News Corporation's ownership were scrutinized in Robert Greenwald's documentary \"\". The documentary, through a panel of former WTTG journalists and staffers, claimed that following Rupert Murdoch's acquisition, WTTG's news reporting became biased and sensationalist. The former WTTG employees claimed that they were ordered \"from the top\" to air an uncut tribute to Ronald Reagan from the 1988 Republican National Convention; they were told to run a piece that \"rehashed the whole matter of [Senator Ted Kennedy's deadly car accident at] Chappaquiddick\" which had \"zero news value\"; and there was an obsessive attitude over airing stories related to wedge issues such as race relations and AIDS.\n\nWTTG attracted controversy over its chief investigative reporter Emily J. Miller, who aired segments critical of gun control without divulging her involvement in gun rights activism. As a result, WTTG added disclosures to Miller's segments informing viewers that she was \"a proponent for Second Amendment rights.\" Miller had claimed that her pro-gun views resulted from being the victim of a home invasion, but \"Washington Post\" blogger Erik Wemple discovered that her account was largely fabricated. Critics also highlighted missteps in Miller's reporting, including an incident where she confused the photographs of two black men and misidentified one of them as a convicted sex offender. Miller left WTTG at the conclusion of her contract in March 2016.\n\nIn May 2017, WTTG was criticized for its coverage of the murder of Seth Rich, and in particular for giving credence to unproven accusations that Rich leaked documents from the Democratic National Committee. This WTTG story proved to be inaccurate. The story was picked up by WTTG's sister network, Fox News, a day after the story broke, and subsequently Fox retracted it.\n\nAs of July 2019, WTTG broadcasts 72 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 12½ hours each weekday, 4½ hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays). The Sunday morning news show \"Fox 5 News on the Hill\" airs in the final half hour of \"Fox 5 Morning News Sunday\" at 8:30 a.m.\n\nOn September 4, 2006, WTTG began simulcasting its weekday morning and nightly 10 p.m. newscasts on then-Baltimore sister station WUTB (now owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group partner company Deerfield Media), under the banner of \"My 24 News\". Management at both stations cited the decision to simulcast as a by-product of cross-regional news interests and increasing overlap between the Baltimore and Washington media markets. In October 2006, while WTTG aired Fox Sports' coverage of the 2006 Major League Baseball postseason, the first half-hour of the 10:00 p.m. newscast was broadcast by sister station WDCA under the title \"Fox 5 News at Ten: Special Edition\"; this also occurred in 2007, with the WDCA broadcast of the program being titled \"My 20 News at 10\".\n\nOn July 2, 2007, WTTG discontinued its noon newscast and replaced it with an hour-long newscast at 11:00 a.m., titled \"Fox 5 News Midday\". On September 10, 2007, the station reformatted its 6:00 p.m. newscast into an early evening edition of \"NewsEdge\"; the addition of \"NewsEdge\" at 6:00 p.m. was due in part to the success of its current 11:00 p.m. counterpart. On January 14, 2009, WTTG and WRC-TV entered into a Local News Service agreement in which the two stations pool video and share news helicopter footage.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, starting with its 6:00 p.m. newscast, WTTG became the third television station in the Washington, D.C. market (behind CBS affiliate WUSA and ABC affiliate WJLA-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 14, 2009, WTTG expanded its weekday morning newscast to five hours by adding another hour at 9:00 a.m.; in turn, its hour-long 11:00 a.m. midday newscast was discontinued. In early 2010, WTTG became the second station in the market (behind WUSA) to expand its weekday morning newscast to 4:30 a.m.\n\nIn late August 2013, WTTG began using the AFD #10 broadcast flag to present their newscasts in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable television through television sets; with the move, it became the second station in the Washington, D.C. market (behind WUSA) to broadcast to utilize the AFD #10 flag.\n\nOn June 16, 2014, WTTG expanded its weekday morning newscasts with the addition of an hour-long block at 10:00 a.m. This was followed on July 12 by the addition of a two-hour Saturday morning newscast from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. and the July 13 expansion of its existing Sunday morning newscast to two hours from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m.\n\nOn June 5, 2017, WTTG added an additional half-hour to its late-night news block, titled \"The Final 5\". This makes WTTG among the very few stations to extend their late newscast to midnight and one of three Fox affiliates (Kansas City's WDAF and Atlanta's WAGA-TV are the others) to air a two-hour late-night news block. On July 17 of the same year, WTTG began producing its primetime nightly newscasts for sister station WDCA titled \"Fox 5 News on the Plus\" (but are titled on-air as \"Fox 5 News at 8pm\"). The weeknight editions, which are run for a half-hour from 8:00 to 8:30 p.m. and from 9:00 to 9:30 p.m. were originally anchored by the 10:00 p.m. team of Tony Perkins, Shawn Yancy and meteorologist Sue Palka, while the weekend editions are run from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Saturday and from 7:00 to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nOn July 8, 2019, WTTG become the third station in the Washington media market to debut an hour-long 4:00 p.m. newscast after WJLA-TV and WRC-TV (WUSA was the first station in the market to debut an hour-long 4:00 p.m. newscast in 1989; however, it was also the first to cancel the 4:00 p.m. newscast, which happened in 2000).\n\n\n\n"}

The main three interactions (dipolar, chemical shift anisotropy, quadrupolar) often lead to very broad and featureless lines. However, these three interactions in solids are orientation-dependent and can be averaged by MAS. The nuclear dipole-dipole interaction, between magnetic moments of nuclei averages to zero only at the magic angle, θ . The chemical shift anisotropy, a nuclear-electron interaction, averages to a non-zero value. The quadrupolar interaction is only partially averaged by MAS leaving a residual secondary quadrupolar interaction. In liquids, e.g. a solution of an organic compound, most of these interactions will average out because of the rapid time-averaged molecular motion that occurs. This orientation averaging in solution is mimicked by MAS of a solid. This causes the signal to become much narrower, giving rise to the isotropic value (which is of interest for structural determination of solid materials and compounds) and spinning sidebands which occur at multiples of the spinning speed and can be used to determine the chemical shift anisotropy of the nuclei.\nThe physical spinning of the sample is achieved via an air turbine mechanism. These turbines (or rotors) come in a variety of diameters (outside diameter), from 0.70–15.0 mm, and are usually spun on air or nitrogen gas. The rotors are made from a number of different materials such as ceramics e.g. zirconia, silicon nitride or polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyoxymethylene (POM). The cylindrical rotors are axially symmetric about the axis of rotation. Samples are packed into the rotors and these are then sealed with a single or double end cap. These caps are made from number of different materials e.g. Kel-F, Vespel, zirconia or boron nitride depending on the application required.\n\nMagic-angle spinning was first described in 1958 by Edward Raymond Andrew, A. Bradbury, and R. G. Eades and independently in 1959 by I. J. Lowe. The name \"magic-angle spinning\" was coined in 1960 by Cornelis J. Gorter at the AMPERE congress in Pisa.\n\nHRMAS is usually applied to solutions and gels where there is some internal molecular motion, but the dipole-dipole interactions are insufficiently averaged by such motion. Under these conditions, HRMAS can dramatically average out the dipole-dipole broadening and result in spectra similar to high resolution NMR. This permits the kind of quantitative analysis of components practiced in solution NMR, e.g.\n\nBy combining cross polarization with MAS, high resolution spectra can be obtained for rigid solids.\n\nUse of Magic Angle Spinning has been extended from solid-state to liquid (solution) NMR.\n"}

It is the junction between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. It is a plane synovial joint.\n\nThe joint is stabilized by three ligaments:\n\nSuperior Acromioclavicular Ligament\nThis ligament is a quadrilateral band, covering the superior part of the articulation, and extending between the upper part of the lateral end of the clavicle and the adjoining part of the upper surface of the acromion.\n\nIt is composed of parallel fibers, which interlace with the aponeuroses of the Trapezius and Deltoideus; below, it is in contact with the articular disk when this is present.\n\nInferior Acromioclavicular Ligament\nThis ligament is somewhat thinner than the preceding; it covers the under part of the articulation, and is attached to the adjoining surfaces of the two bones.\n\nIt is in relation, above, in rare cases with the articular disk; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus\n\nThe Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong triangular band, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion.\n\nIt is attached, by its apex, to the summit of the acromion just in front of the articular surface for the clavicle; and by its broad base to the whole length of the lateral border of the coracoid process.\n\nThis ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms a vault for the protection of the head of the humerus.\n\nIt is in relation, above, with the clavicle and under surface of the Deltoideus; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus, a bursa being interposed.\n\nIts lateral border is continuous with a dense lamina that passes beneath the Deltoideus upon the tendons of the Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus.\n\nThe ligament is sometimes described as consisting of two marginal bands and a thinner intervening portion, the two bands being attached respectively to the apex and the base of the coracoid process, and joining together at the acromion.\n\nWhen the Pectoralis minor is inserted, as occasionally is the case, into the capsule of the shoulder-joint instead of into the coracoid process, it passes between these two bands, and the intervening portion of the ligament is then deficient.\n\nThe Coracoclavicular Ligament serves to connect the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula.\n\nIt does not properly belong to the acromioclavicular joint articulation, but is usually described with it, since it forms a most efficient means of retaining the clavicle in contact with the acromion. It consists of two fasciculi, called the trapezoid ligament and conoid ligament.\n\nThese ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius and Deltoideus; behind, with the Trapezius.\n\nAn X-ray study of 100 shoulders in US soldiers found considerable variation in the size and shape of the joint. The articular surfaces were notably different in size and form. On some they are separated by a meniscus attached to the superior\nacromioclavicular ligament. This meniscus may be a blade of fibrocartilage that extends nearly halfway into the joint or it may form a complete disc that divides the joint into two parts. In other joints no synovial joint is present with the joint being made by a pad of fibrous tissue attached to the outer end of the clavicle, and no articular cavity.\n\nThe acromioclavicular joint provides the ability to raise the arm above the head. This joint functions as a pivot point (although technically it is a gliding synovial joint), acting like a strut to help with movement of the scapula resulting in a greater degree of arm rotation.\n\nA common injury to the AC joint is dislocation, often called AC separation or shoulder separation. This is not the same as a \"shoulder dislocation,\" which refers to dislocation of the glenohumeral joint.\n\nAcromioclavicular joint dislocation is particularly common in collision sports such as ice hockey, football, Judo, rugby and aussie rules, and is also a problem for those who participate in swimming, horseback riding, mountain biking, biking, snow skiing and skateboarding. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on the tip of the shoulder or FOOSH (Fall On OutStretched Hand).\n\nAcromioclavicular joint dislocations are graded from I to VI. Grading is based upon the degree of separation of the acromion from the clavicle with weight applied to the arm. Grade I is slight displacement of the joint, and a badly stretched or partially torn AC ligament. It has the normal separation of <4 mm. Grade II is a partial dislocation of the AC joint with a complete disruption tear of the AC joint and a partial disruption of coracoclavicular ligament. The AC gap is >5 mm. Grades I and II never require surgery and heal by themselves, though physical therapy may be required. Grade III is complete disruption of AC and CC ligaments. On plain film the inferior aspect of the clavicle will be above the superior aspect of the acromion. This can also be assessed with an MRI scan, which will also demonstrate disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments (the degree depending on the severity of AC joint disruption) as well as tearing of the joint capsule. The joint will be very tender and swollen on examination. Grade III separations most often do not require surgery and shoulder function should return to normal after 16–20 weeks. However, there will be some physical deformity of the shoulder with a noticeable bump resulting from the dislocation of the clavicle. Grades IV-VI are complications on a 'standard' dislocation involving a displacement of the clavicle, and will almost always require surgery. Dynamic US is critical to detect mild (grade I) dislocations, especially because they may present as a normal joint in static images. Doppler US may also be used to increase diagnostic confidence to detect low-grade injuries because it depicts reparative process to injured ligament.\n\nOsteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is not uncommon. It may be caused by a prior trauma (secondary osteoarthritis) or occur as a chronic degenerative disorder often co-existing with subacromial impingement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1911810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911810", "title": "Language model", "text": "Language model\n\nA statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given such a sequence, say of length , it assigns a probability formula_1 to the whole sequence.\n\nThe language model provides context to distinguish between words and phrases that sound similar. For example, in American English, the phrases \"recognize speech\" and \"wreck a nice beach\" sound similar, but mean different things.\n\nData sparsity is a major problem in building language models. Most possible word sequences are not observed in training. One solution is to make the assumption that the probability of a word only depends on the previous \"n\" words. This is known as an \"n\"-gram model or unigram model when \"n\" = 1. The unigram model is also known as the bag of words model.\n\nEstimating the relative likelihood of different phrases is useful in many natural language processing applications, especially those that generate text as an output. Language modeling is used in speech recognition, machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, Optical Character Recognition, handwriting recognition, information retrieval and other applications.\n\nIn speech recognition, sounds are matched with word sequences. Ambiguities are easier to resolve when evidence from the language model is integrated with a pronunciation model and an acoustic model.\n\nLanguage models are used in information retrieval in the query likelihood model. There, a separate language model is associated with each document in a collection. Documents are ranked based on the probability of the query \"Q\" in the document's language model formula_2: formula_3. Commonly, the unigram language model is used for this purpose.\n\nA unigram model can be treated as the combination of several one-state finite automata. It splits the probabilities of different terms in a context, e.g. from formula_4 to formula_5.\n\nIn this model, the probability of each word only depends on that word's own probability in the document, so we only have one-state finite automata as units. The automaton itself has a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary of the model, summing to 1. The following is an illustration of a unigram model of a document.\n\nThe probability generated for a specific query is calculated as\n\nDifferent documents have unigram models, with different hit probabilities of words in it. The probability distributions from different documents are used to generate hit probabilities for each query. Documents can be ranked for a query according to the probabilities. Example of unigram models of two documents:\nIn information retrieval contexts, unigram language models are often smoothed to avoid instances where \"P\"(term) = 0. A common approach is to generate a maximum-likelihood model for the entire collection and linearly interpolate the collection model with a maximum-likelihood model for each document to smooth the model.\n\nIn an \"n\"-gram model, the probability formula_1 of observing the sentence formula_9 is approximated as\n\nIt is assumed that the probability of observing the \"i\" word \"w\" in the context history of the preceding \"i\" − 1 words can be approximated by the probability of observing it in the shortened context history of the preceding \"n\" − 1 words (\"n\" order Markov property).\n\nThe conditional probability can be calculated from \"n\"-gram model frequency counts:\n\nThe terms bigram and trigram language models denote \"n\"-gram models with \"n\" = 2 and \"n\" = 3, respectively.\n\nTypically, the \"n\"-gram model probabilities are not derived directly from frequency counts, because models derived this way have severe problems when confronted with any \"n\"-grams that have not been explicitly seen before. Instead, some form of smoothing is necessary, assigning some of the total probability mass to unseen words or \"n\"-grams. Various methods are used, from simple \"add-one\" smoothing (assign a count of 1 to unseen \"n\"-grams, as an uninformative prior) to more sophisticated models, such as Good-Turing discounting or back-off models.\n\nBidirectional representations condition on both pre- and post- context (e.g., words) in all layers.\n\nIn a bigram (\"n\" = 2) language model, the probability of the sentence \"I saw the red house\" is approximated as\n\nwhereas in a trigram (\"n\" = 3) language model, the approximation is\n\nNote that the context of the first \"n\" – 1 \"n\"-grams is filled with start-of-sentence markers, typically denoted <nowiki></nowiki>.\n\nAdditionally, without an end-of-sentence marker, the probability of an ungrammatical sequence \"*I saw the\" would always be higher than that of the longer sentence \"I saw the red house.\"\n\nMaximum entropy language models encode the relationship between a word and the n-gram history using feature functions. The equation is formula_14 where \nformula_15 is the partition function, formula_16 is the parameter vector, and formula_17 is the feature function. In the simplest case, the feature function is just an indicator of the presence of a certain n-gram. It is helpful to use a prior on formula_16 or some form of regularization.\n\nThe log-bilinear model is another example of an exponential language model.\n\nNeural language models (or \"continuous space language models\") use continuous representations or embeddings of words to make their predictions. These models make use of Neural networks.\n\nContinuous space embeddings help to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in language modeling: as language models are trained on larger and larger texts, the number of unique words (the vocabulary) increases. The number of possible sequences of words increases exponentially with the size of the vocabulary, causing a data sparsity problem because of the exponentially many sequences. Thus, statistics are needed to properly estimate probabilities. Neural networks avoid this problem by representing words in a distributed way, as non-linear combinations of weights in a neural net. An alternate description is that a neural net approximates the language function. The neural net architecture might be feed-forward or recurrent, and while the former is simpler the latter is more common.\n\nTypically, neural net language models are constructed and trained as probabilistic classifiers that learn to predict a probability distribution\n\nI.e., the network is trained to predict a probability distribution over the vocabulary, given some linguistic context. This is done using standard neural net training algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation. The context might be a fixed-size window of previous words, so that the network predicts\n\nfrom a feature vector representing the previous words. Another option is to use \"future\" words as well as \"past\" words as features, so that the estimated probability is\n\nThis is called a bag-of-words model. When the feature vectors for the words in the context are combined by a continuous operation, this model is referred to as the continuous bag-of-words architecture (CBOW).\n\nA third option that trains slower than the CBOW but performs slightly better is to invert the previous problem and make a neural network learn the context, given a word. More formally, given a sequence of training words formula_22, one maximizes the average log-probability\n\nwhere , the size of the training context, can be a function of the center word formula_24. This is called a skip-gram language model. Bag-of-words and skip-gram models are the basis of the word2vec program.\n\nInstead of using neural net language models to produce actual probabilities, it is common to instead use the distributed representation encoded in the networks' \"hidden\" layers as representations of words; each word is then mapped onto an -dimensional real vector called the word embedding, where is the size of the layer just before the output layer. The representations in skip-gram models have the distinct characteristic that they model semantic relations between words as linear combinations, capturing a form of compositionality. For example, in some such models, if is the function that maps a word to its -d vector representation, then\n\nwhere ≈ is made precise by stipulating that its right-hand side must be the nearest neighbor of the value of the left-hand side.\n\nA positional language model assesses the probability of given words occurring close to one another in a text, not necessarily immediately adjacent.

The station is owned by Howard University, a historically black college, and is sister to commercial urban contemporary radio station WHUR (96.3 FM). WHUT-TV's studios are located on the Howard University campus, and its transmitter is located in the Tenleytown neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of Washington.\n\nChannel 32 was founded on September 29, 1980 as WHMM-TV. The station was the first African-American owned and operated public educational station in the United States. In 1998, the station changed its call sign to WHUT, standing for Howard University Television, the station's branding.\n\nSince its founding, WHUT has won 11 Emmys and 8 Communications Excellence to Black Audiences Awards. Despite this success, budget cuts have forced the station to roll back programming hours in recent years. As of October 21, 2007, digital channel 33 was on the air with a simulcast of the programming on analog channel 32. By November 21, 2007, the station had corrected an earlier problem with the lack of PSIP data so that digital receivers could lock on to it. Today, WHUT airs a variety of standard PBS programming, as well as programs produced by Howard University, and international programs focusing on regions such as the Caribbean and Africa.\n\nSoon after the start of preparations for the 2016-17 spectrum reallocation auction, Howard University announced that it was considering the sale of WHUT-TV's channel 33 allocation in the auction in order to alleviate longstanding financial issues at the university. The station was entered into the auction when it began in March 2016. Because of WHUT-TV's status as the only black-owned public television station in the United States, the decision attracted sustained opposition from faculty and community members who feared the loss of a rare minority voice in public media. Howard announced WHUT-TV was withdrawn from the auction on February 16, 2017; the official reason was that the station's asking price had become low enough through the reverse auction process that it was apparent selling would not produce sufficient proceeds to justify ending operations.\n\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\nIn July 2009, Washington, D.C. TV stations became a test market for Mobile DTV, and WHUT was one of the participating stations.\n\nWHUT-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 32, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 33. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 32.\n\nWHUT-TV commenced ATSC-M/H (Mobile DTV) broadcasting on February 27, 2011. WHUT-TV is the last remaining Washington-market broadcaster to broadcast an M/H signal. The signal nominally contains a feed of its main programming in standard definition on 32.1 and an audio feed of WAMU on 32.2, although neither stream contains audio or video data.\n\n"}

During the night, eight homeless people, including six minors, were killed by a group of men beside the Candelária Church. Several of the men were members of the police and were tried for the killings, but only two were convicted.\n\nThe Candelária Church is a famous historic Roman Catholic church in central Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The church itself and the buildings around it in Pius X Square became known as a popular location for possibly hundreds of Rio de Janeiro's street children to form a makeshift home at night. The church's personnel provides food, shelter, education and religious advice to as many of these children as possible. Many of the homeless children are involved with the illegal drug trade and prostitution, and because many of these children also live around the church during the day, police keep a constant watch on the church's surroundings. In the early 1990s, the area around the Candelária Church developed a high crime rate as street children increasingly began to commit criminal activities such as pickpocketing and robbery.\n\nAccording to survivors, on the morning of July 22, 1993, the day before the massacre, a group of children threw stones at police cars, with some of the policemen allegedly saying \"don't worry, we will get you soon!\" to threaten them. As the children from the Candelária Church area were usually only given warnings by policemen, the young perpetrators left without worrying too much about the threat. At midnight, several Chevrolet Chevette cars with covered license plates came to a halt in front of the Candelária Church, and the occupants began shooting at the group of roughly seventy street children sleeping in the vicinity of the church.\n\n\nSix children and two adults were killed and numerous others were wounded outside the Candelária Church. Subsequently, during the investigations the shots were found to be fired by policemen, and fifty officers were accused of the massacre. One of them, Mauricio da Conceição, died during a shootout as he was about to be arrested in 1994. Two others, Marcos Emmanuel and Nelson Cunha, were handed sentences equivalent to life sentences. However, they could potentially avoid the imprisonment, as Brazilian law says that anyone who gets a sentence of twenty or more years in jail, automatically qualifies for a second trial. One of the children that survived that attack was supposedly shot several times before he could testify against policemen that were to go to trial, and ended up fleeing from Brazil in order to save his life.\n\nThe international community severely condemned the attack, and many in Brazil asked for the prosecution of those who shot the Candelária Church children.\n\nThe event also was mentioned in the song \"The Candelaria Massacre\" recorded by a Brazilian death metal band Lacerated And Carbonized (from the 2013's album \"The Core of Disruption\").\n\nA social worker who later tracked the fate of these homeless survivors of the Candelária massacre found out that eventually 39 of them were either killed by police or by elements of street life, and discusses this in \"Bus 174\", centered around the Nascimento incident.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a nominal duopoly with Hagerstown, Maryland-licensed independent station WDVM-TV (channel 25); however, the two stations maintain separate operations. WDCW's studios are located on Wisconsin Avenue in the Glover Park section of Washington, and it shares transmitter facilities with Arlington, Virginia-licensed Univision-owned station WFDC-DT (channel 14) in the Tenleytown section of Washington's northwest quadrant.\n\nOn cable, WDCW is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 23 in Washington, D.C. and Montgomery County, Maryland, Xfinity channel 11 in Reston, Virginia, and channel 3 on most other systems in the market. The station is carried on satellite provider DirecTV (as standard definition only \"CW-E\") to serve the few areas of the eastern United States where a CW affiliate is not receivable over-the-air or through cable, and on JetBlue's LiveTV in-flight entertainment system via DirecTV (the other network stations featured on JetBlue are predominantly from New York City).\n\nChannel 50, Inc. was issued a construction permit for station WGSP-TV in 1967. Plans to commence operation in the summer of 1971 were scuttled by the sudden death of Channel 50's principal owner, former \"American Forum of the Air\" host Ted Granik, on September 21, 1970. Granik's will did not leave any funding for WGSP-TV, forcing it to declare bankruptcy. Channel 50, Inc. was then involved in a protracted legal battle over a sale to Washington resident and former WBNB-TV owner Ted Ledbetter – held up by the Federal Communications Commission due to questions about his financial backing – and subsequent permission to become Washington's one allowable subscription television station, which was also sought by WDCA (channel 20).\n\nAfter both hearings went in Ledbetter's favor in July 1980, channel 50 signed on under the callsign WCQR on April 1, 1981. Beginning on November 1, WCQR aired the subscription television service SuperTV at night and live pictures of Washington, D.C. from above its broadcast tower during the daytime. Early in the day, WCQR also ran some basic computer still images with music called \"Morning Muse\". The live pictures were soon replaced with programming from the Financial News Network. Hill Broadcasting purchased both Channel 50 and WHLL-TV (now Univision affiliate WUNI) in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1985. On July 1, the call letters were changed to WFTY, in reference to its channel FifTY allocation. It then became a full-time independent station in early 1986. Initially, the station ran a lineup of classic off-network sitcoms, dramas, cartoons, movies and some religious programs. WFTY also picked up the ABC soap opera \"Ryan's Hope\" after WJLA-TV (Channel 7) dropped it in 1986, with Channel 50 running the final years of the program.\n\nThe station was airing mostly religious programs, infomercials, low-budget (but copyrighted) movies, and a few off-network dramas by 1988. Ratings were very low, in addition to the programming costs. WFTY did pick up a few cartoons for the weekday 7 to 9 a.m. slot in June 1990 when Fox owned-and-operated station WTTG (channel 5) dropped its children's block in favor of launching a weekday morning newscast. In 1993, WFTY (along with WHLL) were purchased by the Jasas Corporation. In the fall of that year, WFTY added more cartoons, barter sitcoms, some low-priced syndicated shows, and cut back on paid programming.\n\nWFTY joined The WB on February 20, 1995, six weeks after the network started broadcasting. WJAL (channel 68) in Hagerstown, Maryland was the network's charter affiliate in the Washington market; as WJAL's signal did not reach the core metropolitan area, both stations aired WB programming. As the network provided only a single block on Wednesdays from 8 to 10 p.m. at the time, WFTY ran WB programs on six consecutive weeknights in order to catch up and begin airing the schedule in pattern on March 1. On September 6, the station's call letters were changed to WBDC-TV to reflect its network status, with the callsign being a portmanteau of WB and Washington DC. In 1996, the Tribune Company (which had a minority ownership interest in The WB) began managing the station and purchased the station outright from the Jasas Corporation in 1999.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that The WB and UPN would shut down that September and be replaced by a new network that would include some of the two networks' higher-rated programs called The CW. WBDC was named as the D.C. area's CW affiliate as Tribune signed a 10-year affiliation agreement for 16 of the company's 19 WB stations. On May 1, WBDC's call letters were changed to the current WDCW to reflect the pending switch. On July 20, 2006, the station began to run on-air promotions that featured a new logo and branding as \"The CW Washington\". WDCW joined The CW when the network launched nationwide on September 18, 2006.\n\nIn August 2008, WDCW began to be branded on-air as \"DC50\" reducing the promotion of The CW to just the tagline; this was followed on August 14 with the introduction of a new logo; this branding change came as Tribune's CW-affiliated stations began to de-emphasize references to the network in their branding. On-air, the station used \"DC 50\" as their branding and at some points \"Home of The CW\" as their slogan while \"The CW Washington\" branding continued to be used on the station's website. In press releases seen online, WDCW was also using the \"Home of The CW\" slogan. The slogan began being used on-air and online on August 22, 2008. The CW logo returned to the station's branding in 2010, changing it to \"DC50 The CW.\" In July 2014, the station was rebranded as \"DCW Television,\" and introduced a new logo.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Three weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The termination of the Sinclair sale agreement places uncertainty for the future of Fox's purchases of KSTU and the other six Tribune stations included in that deal, which were predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned Hagerstown, Maryland-based independent station WDVM-TV (channel 25) since December 2003—announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019, forming a nominal duopoly with WDVM-TV; however, Nexstar plans to keep their operations separate due to WDVM-TV serving a smaller portion of the viewing area while WDCW serves the entire viewing area.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWDCW stopped transmitting on its analog signal, over UHF channel 50, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 51 to channel 50 for post-transition operations.\n\nIn April 2017, Tribune sold WDCW's broadcast spectrum to the FCC for $122 million as part of the commission's 2016–17 spectrum reallocation reverse auction. On August 31, 2017, it was announced that WDCW had entered into a channel sharing agreement with Univision owned-and-operated station WFDC-DT. WDCW ended broadcasts over its own channel 50 and began sharing WFDC's channel 15 on January 23, 2018.\n\nIn addition to The CW's program schedule, syndicated programming broadcast by WDCW includes \"The Jerry Springer Show\", \"The Steve Wilkos Show\", \"Maury\" and \"2 Broke Girls\", among others.\n\nAs an independent station, the station carried a 7:30 p.m. newscast produced by NBC owned-and-operated station WRC-TV, titled \"7:30 News Headlines\", which launched on January 14, 1991; the newscast suffered low ratings during its run and ended almost ten months later on October 25, 1991.\n\nThe station began to produce a weekly news program in Washington, D.C. and neighboring parts of Maryland and Virginia known as the \"Inner Loop\" from 2005 to 2007 in conjunction with George Washington University and Montgomery College. The \"Inner Loop\" eventually evolved into \"Weekend News with Chris Core\" which was produced at the Tribune National Media Center in Downtown Washington from 2007 to 2010. Since 2010 the station has been broadcasting the Emmy-nominated \"NewsPlus with Mark Segraves\", a half-hour locally produced program that airs Sunday mornings. Hosted by investigative reporter Mark Segraves, the 30-minute program features local investigative reports and interviews with regional and national newsmakers.\n\nOn April 16, 2016, WDCW began airing a nightly half-hour 10pm newscast produced by Tribune sister station WTVR-TV, the CBS affiliate for Richmond, Virginia. WTVR's Candace Burns solo anchored the weeknight newscasts, along with chief meteorologist Zach Daniel and sports director Lane Casadonte. Saturday evenings were anchored by Angie Miles, meteorologist Mike Goldberg, and Sean Robertson on sports. Tracy Sears handled anchor duties on Sunday nights, with Goldberg and Robertson on weather and sports, respectively. On September 6, 2018, Tribune announced that the newscast would be cancelled effective September 28.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, DCW Television created HealthyDC, a station-wide initiative intended to create awareness and educate the DMV to become healthier and happier.\n\nIn 2009 DCW Television celebrated Black History month in February with a series of locally produced programming in a \"Living Black History Campaign\". This included two syndicated specials, as well as multiple vignettes / features that included such notables as Aretha Franklin, Oscar winner Mo'Nique, Arsenio Hall and many others. DCW Television had broadcast two locally produced specials that focused on historic events which impacted the immediate Metro DC community.\n\n\"Direct Access with Big Tigger\" (2009-2013) was a locally produced entertainment program, hosted by television and radio personality Darian \"Big Tigger\" Morgan, highlighting entertainment, sports, music and D.C. area nightlife; the half-hour show aired original episodes on Fridays at 12 a.m and encore episodes Sundays at 10 p.m.\n\n\"SportsWeek\" (2010-2013) was a weekly sports talk program hosted by former Washington Redskins linebacker LaVar Arrington; the program aired Saturday afternoons at 1:30 p.m., with encores on Sundays at 12:30 p.m.\n\n\"The Dream Began Here\", DCW Television's 2012 \"Living Black History Special\", won Outstanding Documentary: Historical. From the first African-Americans to pioneer the Civil Rights Movement, to our first African-American president, the documentary explored the evolving roles African Americans had within the White House, the city of Washington, D.C., and our surrounding areas.\n\nThe WDCW documentary, \"Hattie's Lost Legacy\" was presented the \"Outstanding Documentary/Local Market\" National Gracie award by the Alliance for Women in the Media in 2012. \"Hattie's Lost Legacy\" recounted the story of Oscar Winner Hattie McDaniel's life, focusing on the disappearance of her historic Oscar from Howard University in Washington, DC. \"Hattie's Lost Legacy\" premiered in February 2011 as part of DC50's \"Living Black History\" local programming campaign. \"Hattie's Lost Legacy\" was also a 2012 finalist in the National Association of Black Journalists television awards in the documentary category and was nominated for a Washington Regional Emmy in the Documentary/Historic category.\n\nDCW Television was awarded the prestigious \"Salute to Excellence Award\" by the National Association of Black Journalists for the 2010 local documentary, \"Howard Theatre: A Century in Song\".\n\n\"Direct Access with Big Tigger\" received an Emmy in the \"Outstanding Local Program – Entertainment Category\" in 2012.\n\nDCW Television won an Outstanding Public Service Announcement for 2012 DCW Television's \"Trot for Hunger\" PSA promoting the Annual Thanksgiving 5K Race to support the local charity So Others Might Eat (SOME). DCW Television has supported SOME's Trot for Hunger for 13 years and has seen the event, which supports DC's homeless, grow from 300 runners in 2001 to 13,000 in 2013.\n\n"}

The dam is located in the range immediately west of Cairns.\n\nOriginally Cairns' water needs were met with water drawn from Freshwater Creek and Behana Creek. It was evident to even the earliest settlers that a larger source of water would need to be secured as Cairns grew.\n\nWith this in mind, one of the city's engineers, F Morris, explored the Lamb Range to the west of the city to find a place to build a dam. In 1935 he found a site at Copperlode falls, near the headwaters of Freshwater Creek, that he thought would be suitable. Many years later, after a series of surveys confirmed the site's suitability, the Queensland Government approved the site for construction of an earth and rock fill dam.\n\nThe State Government originally set aside A$3 million for the dam, but by the time the dam was completed on 25 March 1976, the total cost had risen to approximately $6.5 million. The reservoir holds 45,000 megalitres of water (in comparison to Lake Tinaroo's 407,000 megalitres).\n\nThe reservoir is named Lake Morris after Cairns City engineer Frank Roland Morris who discovered its site, but the dam itself is named after the waterfalls it replaced - Copperlode Falls.\n\nDaily updates on water levels can be found at http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/water-waste-roads/water/water-sources-supply via a link to \"CRC Water Summary Report\".

Although he had chosen music over his interest in film, his experience aided him in directing his own music videos for dEUS, and he made a short film in 1996 titled \"Turnpike\". He also directed videos for other Belgian musicians including Axelle Red and Hooverphonic among others.\n\nHe is of Norwegian descent from his father's side.\n\nIn the summer of 2002 shooting started in Antwerp for his first feature film \"Any Way the Wind Blows\" which was released in Belgian cinemas in the summer of 2003. In February 2004, he released \"The Body Gave You Everything\", the debut album by Magnus, his dance-oriented project with techno producer CJ Bolland.\n\nBarman has since explored the other side of the camera as well. He agreed to a \"leading role\" allowing directors, Manu Riche and Renaat Lambeet to film a documentary derived by Barman's everyday life, entitled \"Tempo of a Restless Soul\". After showing at the Ghent Film Festival one reviewer from \"Flanders Today\" ranked the film with a split score. He feels the film should receive three of five stars for fans only, and two stars for others. Deus fans already familiar with Barman, he pointed out, may be interested in the backstage, personal nature of the man due to the everyday \"fly on the wall\" view of the film. However, he cautioned, it might be confusing to find the semi-retiring rock frontman behind scenes.\n\nBarman is now again playing with Deus. In 2006, Barman was one of the driving forces behind the 0110 concerts.\n\nThe singer got involved in polemics in Belgium, when after expressing strong opposition towards male sexual harassment on Belgian national tv, a Dutch lady referred to meeting him some 15 years ago, where Barman insisted her to give him a blowjob in order to have access to a cafe toilet. Barman excused himself for this.\n\n"}

He joined the Warsaw Cadet Corps in 1810. In 1812 he stood guard on the Hotel Angielski in Warsaw when Napoleon stayed there incognito, during his escape from Moscow. In 1823 he became adjutant to Wincenty Krasiński a former officer in Napoleon's Army who at the time was with the Royal Regiment of Grenadier Guards. Through Krasiński's connections he got access to the Palace's art galleries, gaining exposure to military paintings particularly those of Horace Vernet. He also gained access to Poland's leading artistic and intellectual circles meeting such luminaries as Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Woronicz, Koźmian, Franciszek Salezy Dmochowski, Antoni Edward Odyniec, and Morawski. During this period he started painting pictures with military themes, particularly battles from the Kościuszko Uprising and the Napoleonic wars including those in which Krasiński was involved in during the Peninsular War.

Toklas is a 1968 romantic comedy film starring Peter Sellers, directed by Hy Averback with music by Harpers Bizarre. The film is set in the counterculture of the 1960s. The cast includes David Arkin, Jo Van Fleet, Leigh Taylor-Young (in her film debut) and a cameo by the script's co-writer Paul Mazursky. The title refers to the writer Alice B. Toklas, whose 1954 autobiographical cookbook had a recipe for cannabis brownies.\n\nAttorney Harold Fine (Sellers) is forced into setting a date for marriage by his secretary/fiancée Joyce. Because of a fender bender, he ends up driving a hippie vehicle, a psychedelically-painted station wagon. At the funeral of his family's butcher he encounters his brother, Herbie, a hippie living in Venice Beach. Herbie's girlfriend, an attractive flower power hippie girl named Nancy (Leigh Taylor-Young), takes a liking to Harold and makes him pot brownies. However, she departs without telling him, and not knowing what they are he eats them and feeds them to his father, mother, and fiancée, who dissolve in laughter and silliness. Harold considers the \"trip\" a revelation, and begins renouncing aspects of his \"straight\" life. He tells his fiancée \"no\" at the chuppah, starts living with Nancy, and tries to find himself with the aid of a guru, whose name is Guru. Ultimately he discovers the hippie lifestyle is as unfulfilling and unsatisfying as his old lifestyle—Nancy says that monogamy \"isn't hip\"—and once more decides to marry Joyce. At the last minute, he again leaves her at the altar and runs out of the wedding onto a city street saying he doesn't know for sure what he is looking for but, \"there's got to be something beautiful out there.\"\n\n\nVincent Canby in \"The New York Times\" called it \"a very derivative comedy,\" with Peter Sellers \"sometimes funny (as he tries to spread love among the police) but quite often grotesque (in some embarrassingly intimate bed scenes)\"; whereas \"Variety\" was more positive: \"Film blasts off into orbit via top-notch acting and direction. Sellers’ performance – both in scenes which spotlight his character as well as ensemble sequences in which everyone is balanced nicely – is an outstanding blend of warmth, sensitivity, disillusion and optimism\"; while Roger Ebert found some of the movie \"good and pretty close to the mark, and Sellers is very funny,\" he disliked the film's stereotyped view of hippiedom, concluding \"If they'd dropped Sellers into a real hippie culture, we might really have had a movie here.\"\n\n\"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas\" was released to DVD by Warner Home Video June 20, 2006, as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and years later in 2011 as a DVD-on-demand title via Warner Archive.\n\n\n"}

There is some evidence that a team played in Bedwas as early as 1885, though official recognition of Bedwas RFC is placed at 1889.\n\nBedwas RFC was a founding member of both the Junior Monmouthshire League (1903) and the Rhymney Valley League (1906), and in 1910 applied for and succeeded in joining the Welsh Rugby Union. At the outbreak of World War I (1914) rugby ceased in most of South Wales and this was true of Bedwas. After the war a period of rebuilding occurred with the club based initially at the Church Inn before moving to Bridge End Inn during the 1920–21 season. During this period Bedwas RFC enjoyed connections with local colliery owner and airline magnate Sir Samuel Instone.\n\n1926 saw a great economic depression in South Wales and as local young men left to find work in more prosperous areas, rugby in Bedwas waned.\n\nPost World War II saw a rebuilding of rugby in Bedwas and in 1947 the club acquired Bridge field and an ex-Ministry of Works long hut which became the club house. In 1960 the club formed a youth team. Bedwas also have a very successful seconds side which remains undefeated in the 2007–08 season.\n\nIn 2007, Bedwas were the only club in the Welsh Premier League to be threatened with relegation due to them initially failing a facilities review conducted by the WRU.\n\nThe following players have represented Bedwas and have been capped at international level.\n\n"}

In addition, Frank appeared in numerous theater productions, including \"Hang on to Me\" at the Guthrie Theater, which was directed by Peter Sellers, as well as many productions in Los Angeles, mostly at the Taper. He created the Struggling Actor's Coloring Book and dozens of paintings, which are now in private collections. He was noted by colleagues for his intelligence and endless wit.\n\nFrank played infamous lawyer and informal powerbroker Roy Cohn in the first ever performance of Tony Kushner's play \"Angels in America\". Cohn, who in real life, also died from AIDS-related complications.\n\nBy 1993, Frank had already gone public with his affliction with AIDS. He continued working heavily in television as long as his health allowed. In the wake of his public disclosure, Frank was asked to guest-star in a very special and true-to-life role in the fourth season \"Life Goes On\" episode \"Bedfellows\".

{"id": "1911924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911924", "title": "Mark Walters", "text": "Mark Walters\n\nMark Everton Walters (born 2 June 1964) is an English former professional footballer who played as a Midfielder from 1981 to 2002.\n\nHe notably played for Liverpool, Rangers and Aston Villa, and later went on to play for Stoke City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers. He was capped once by England.\n\nWalters began his career as an apprentice at Aston Villa on leaving school in the summer of 1980, turning the professional a year later – just after Villa's Football League First Division title triumph – and made his competitive debut on 28 April 1982 in a 4–1 league defeat at home to Leeds United, two months after the departure of manager Ron Saunders – who had given Walters his first professional contract – and the promotion of assistant Tony Barton to the manager's seat. Walters was not included in Villa's squad for the final of the European Cup on 26 May 1982, which they won 1–0 against Bayern Munich, the West German champions. Walters, still only 18, made 22 league appearances in the 1982–83 campaign as Villa finished sixth. He scored once that season. He was firmly established as a regular player in the 1983–84 season, appearing 37 times in the league and scoring eight goals, though Villa had a disappointing season and finished 10th, with Tony Barton being sacked at the end of the season and replaced by Graham Turner.\n\nWalters, now highly rated as one of the country's most promising young players, remained in favour under Graham Turner, but Villa were in deep trouble throughout the 1985–86 season, finishing 16th and only avoiding relegation thanks to a late run of good form. Walters was restricted to 21 league games due to injury problems in 1986–87 as Villa were relegated in bottom place. Turner had been sacked in September and replaced by Billy McNeill, who in turn lost his job after relegation to be succeeded by Graham Taylor. Walters appeared in the first 24 games of Villa's ultimately successful quest to regain First Division status, scoring seven goals.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Scottish club Rangers signed several English players, including internationals Terry Butcher, Trevor Steven, Gary Stevens, Chris Woods and Ray Wilkins. English clubs were banned from European competition, which meant that Rangers, who were managed by former Liverpool star Graeme Souness, were finding it easier to attract English players. Walters moved to Rangers for ₤500,000 on New Year's Eve 1987. Previously, black players had been a rarity in Scottish football. Queen's Park and Hearts had black players in the 19th Century and Gil Heron played for Celtic in 1951. Rangers had also previously signed a black player, Walter Tull, but he died during the First World War before he could appear for Rangers.\n\nWalters made his Rangers debut on 2 January 1988 in the Old Firm derby match with Celtic at Parkhead, a game which Rangers lost 2–0. The Celtic support subjected Walters to monkey noises and the throwing of bananas and other fruit. Rangers banned one of their own supporters after an incident during Walters' home debut. Walters himself later stated that his worst experience in Scotland was at Heart of Midlothian's Tynecastle, where the abuse was compounded by object-throwing. The abuse at Tynecastle was widely covered in the Scottish media, with commentator Archie Macpherson criticising it during the highlights package on \"Sportscene\". Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer apologised to Walters.\n\nWhilst at Ibrox, Walters was part of the side that won the Scottish Premier Division in 1989, 1990 and 1991 and the Scottish League Cup in 1988 and 1990, thus enjoying the most successful spell of his career in terms of trophies won.\n\nLiverpool paid £1.25 million for Walters' services and he made his debut four days after signing, when he came on as a 65th-minute substitute for Steve McMahon in a 2–1 league win over Oldham Athletic at Anfield on 17 August 1991. His first goal for the club was an 88th-minute penalty in a 2–1 league win over Notts County at Meadow Lane on 7 September 1991.\n\nHis best display all season was in a match against Auxerre at Anfield in the Uefa Cup. Liverpool trailed 2–0 from the away leg but won their home match 3–0 with Walters netting a late winner after tormenting the French defence all night long. He remained a regular in the side and helped Liverpool to the 1992 FA Cup Final, although he was an unused substitute as his teammates beat 2nd Division Sunderland 2–0. However, he appeared in just 25 out of 42 league appearances for the Reds that season, scoring three goals as they finished sixth – the first time since 1981 that they had finished lower than champions or runners-up.\n\nWalters scored Liverpool's first FA Premier League goal when he equalised in a 2–1 win over Sheffield United in August 1992. That same season he was also the first Liverpool player to score a Premiership hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Coventry City. He was their second highest scorer behind Ian Rush that season, scoring 11 goals in 34 league games, though the Reds finished sixth again. He lost his regular place in central midfield to youngster Jamie Redknapp in the 1993–94 season and never regained it. When Liverpool beat Bolton Wanderers 2–1 in the 1995 League Cup final, again an unused substitute, Walters was being used less as Roy Evans was employing three centre-halves with Rob Jones and Stig Inge Bjørnebye as wing-backs and three midfielders – Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and John Barnes.\n\nHe had already been sent out on loan to Stoke City (9 games, 2 goals) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (11 games, 3 goals) during the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, and thus it was not surprising that, after not appearing at all during the first half of the 1995–96 season, Walters was allowed to leave, joining Southampton on 18 January 1996 on a free transfer.\n\nWalters was signed by David Merrington in January 1996 to assist in the Saints' desperate fight against relegation from the Premiership. He made his debut as a substitute against Middlesbrough on 20 January 1996 and made a total of five league and four FA Cup appearances (with the Saints reaching the quarter-finals of the competition), but struggled to make any real impression with the side. His final appearance was in a dreadful match away to Queens Park Rangers, which Saints lost 3–0 meekly surrendering in a shoddy second half. At the end of the season, with Saints' Premiership status secured for another season, Walters was released, moving on to Swindon Town, as Graeme Souness – the man who signed him for Liverpool five years earlier – was arriving at Southampton to succeed the sacked Merrington.\n\nWalters joined Swindon Town on a free on 31 July 1996 and made his debut on 17 August in the 2–0 defeat to Norwich City at Carrow Road. His first goal for the Robins came via a 26th-minute penalty during the 2–1 league win over Tranmere Rovers on 14 September 1996.\n\nAt the County Ground, Walters was \"sometimes brilliant, but at other times could be very frustrating\". He never really featured in manager Jimmy Quinn's plans, and was eventually released to Bristol Rovers on a free transfer during the administration period, when it was decided Town could no longer afford his wages. Walters played a total of 126 matches for Swindon in which he scored 28 goals before he was released on 17 November 1999.\n\nHaving been told that he was no longer required by Swindon the 35-year-old joined Ian Holloway's Bristol Rovers side on a free transfer. He spent three years at the Memorial Stadium playing 96 times and scoring 14 goals before he finally retired on 26 April 2002, five weeks before his 38th birthday. The penultimate season of his career saw Rovers slip into Division Three, and they struggled at this level too, finishing the season just one place – though many points – above relegated Halifax Town.\n\nWalters represented England at schoolboy and under 21 levels before he earning his only full cap under Graham Taylor whilst he was with Rangers. It came on 3 June 1991 in the 1–0 friendly victory over New Zealand in Auckland.\n\nWalters joined Coventry Preparatory School as a Saturday morning football coach for the four- to 11-year–olds in February 2003; he then became a member of staff in January 2006, coaching years three to eight and is also head coach of the under-14s at Aston Villa's academy. Walters is also heavily involved with groups aiming to eliminate racism in football. Walters went back to school and obtained teaching qualifications. He is Head of Languages at Aston Villa's academy.\n\nAlthough now retired, Walters still plays in the Sky Sports masters football competitions for Rangers. He is also one of three honorary members of the Rangers Supporters Trust, along with Johnny Hubbard and Billy Simpson.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The series is notable for being the last in a series of three comedies by co-writer David Croft to use many of the same actors, starting with \"Hi-de-Hi!\" and followed by \"You Rang, M'Lord?\" and was also the last full series written by David Croft.\n\n\"Oh, Doctor Beeching!\" focuses on the small fictional branch line railway station of Hatley, which is threatened with closure under the Beeching Axe. The programme was filmed on the Severn Valley Railway. Arley SVR station in Upper Arley was used as Hatley station.\n\nSet in 1963, at a rural branch line railway station called Hatley, Jack Skinner (Paul Shane) the porter is acting stationmaster until a replacement is found. Jack deeply loves his wife May (played by Sherrie Hewson in the pilot episode, with her scenes re-recorded by Julia Deakin when repeated as the first episode of the regular series) who runs the station buffet, but is prone to becoming very jealous of her around other men. Without a station master the station has become rather disorganised: for instance the eternally miserable signalman Harry Lambert (Stephen Lewis), is so underworked that he is running several sidelines from his signalbox – including hair-cutting, selling fruit and vegetables, repairing bicycles and taking bets – seeing his signalling duties as an unwelcome distraction; he frequently speaks of \"ruddy trains\". The station is part run by the eccentric and easily flustered booking clerk Ethel Schumann (Su Pollard), who is always on the lookout for a new man in her life and whose son Wilfred (Paul Aspden), the product of a relationship with a now deceased American soldier during the war, is the station dogsbody. Wilfred often comes across as stupid, but sometimes displays signs that he is brighter than he appears – for instance in the episode \"The Van\", he finds Arnold's missing wife Jessica.\n\nAlso present are Vera Plumtree (Barbara New), who has no particular role, but seems to do various jobs around the station and acts as Mr Parkin's housekeeper. Her late husband used to work on the railway, as she frequently reminds the other members of staff; her catchphrase is \"he was an engine driver you know\". She very often muddles her words and seems to be fond of Harry (who always ignores her advances) and Gloria (Lindsay Grimshaw), Jack and May's pretty teenage daughter, who loves wearing short skirts, much to the chagrin of her father. She shows an interest in men, but Jack is over-protective and will not let any man take her out. Several other members of railway staff appear, including an older engine driver Arnold Thomas (Ivor Roberts); his inexperienced fireman Ralph (Perry Benson), who is training to be a driver; and the flirtatious guard, Percy (Terry John), with whom Ethel appears to be quite besotted at times. He returns her advances, but seems to prefer Gloria's friend, Amy Matlock (Tara Daniels), who appears in most episodes, albeit usually briefly. Richard Spendlove, one of the writers and the co-creator, also appeared in several episodes as Mr Orkindale, the district inspector.\n\nSoon the new stationmaster arrives in the guise of Cecil Parkin (Jeffrey Holland), a stern, well spoken man. He is amazed to learn that the café is run by May (then called Blanchflower), with whom he had a passionate fling during the war before she married Jack – although we later learn that she was seeing both of them at the same time. Although Jack is in the dark as to May and Cecil's history, he takes an instant dislike to the new stationmaster. A running subplot to the series is the question of whether Gloria is actually Jack's daughter, or the result of May's fling with Cecil (although in the second series episode \"Father's Day\", it is generally concluded that Jack is her father). Meanwhile, at the end of the episode a newspaper article is found threatening the station with closure under the Beeching Axe, which begins the series.\n\nA running gag in the series is Vera almost finding out about Cecil and May's relationship. Mr Parkin steals every moment he possibly can with May, often sneaking into the kitchen near the beginning of the day, before anyone else has arrived and Vera catching them almost every time.\n\nThe series ran for two series, although the final episode did not conclude by answering whether the station was going to be closed, as it was unknown at the time of production whether a third series would be produced or not. The series was axed due to unsatisfactory viewing figures, later blamed on the BBC for constantly altering the time of broadcasting as one episode was broadcast in August due to the broadcast of the 1997 Athletics World Championship in Athens on 3 and 10 August, \"The Great Antiques Hunt\" broadcast on 24 August and the wall to wall coverage of the Death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on 31 August.\n\nCecil Parkin (Jeffrey Holland) Stationmaster – the new stationmaster at Hatley who appears midway through the first episode. He is a perfectionist and is determined to make the station the best on the line. On the surface, he seems refined, but it turns out that he knows the station's buffet manager because they had a passionate affair, which was going on behind her boyfriend (later husband) Jack Skinner's back. He still has lecherous thoughts about her and in several episodes he tries his best to get her to leave Jack. The station staff react to him in different ways – most are tolerant of him, but Jack and Harry, the signalman, take an intense dislike to him, which only slightly mellows as the series goes on.\n\nJack Skinner (Paul Shane) Head Porter and Deputy Stationmaster – He is deeply in love with his beautiful wife, May, but gets very jealous whenever she comes into close contact with other men, especially Cecil. He heartily dislikes Cecil and shows it. He is an ex-soldier with a limp from a wound he supposedly received during the war - only in Episode 9 we learn that his leg was wounded when he was thrown out of a pub and the landlord's wife slammed the door on his foot, not during a battle, although Ethel changed the story to him jumping on a German tank to shove a land mine down it and a big German trapped his foot in the door.\n\nEthel Schumann (Su Pollard) Ticket Clerk – She is scatter-brained and sometimes muddles her words. She often gets frustrated with Jack for his jealousy of May. She is also a flirt – she has a son from her marriage to a now deceased American soldier named Earl, whom she frequently refers to in the earlier episodes. She is desperate for another boyfriend and frequently makes advances to the station's guard, Percy, who appreciates her advances, but seems more interested in the regular commuter, Amy. She is the only one who knows of Cecil and May's war-time fling once May tells her.\n\nHarry Lambert (Stephen Lewis) Signalman – He is eternally miserable, with Stephen Lewis portraying the character very much like \"Blakey\" in \"On the Buses\". He never smiles and often sees the down side of things, never being seen happy. He hates his job, often calling the trains \"ruddy\". Because trains come through Hatley only a few times a day, he operates numerous sidelines from his box: growing vegetables, mending bikes and clocks, rearing farm animals (pigs, turkeys and chickens) for the staff's dinners, giving haircuts and taking bets. They are all illegal, yet all the staff, including Gloria know about them, are customers and keep their mouths shut. Cecil does not know, as he would make it stop. There is a recurring gag, where Harry will say, \"if they poke their noses around, they will get the flat end o' my tongue\", that person comes and he starts sucking up to them. He often resists Vera's advances.\n\nMay Skinner (née Blanchflower) (Julia Deakin) Buffet Manageress – She had a passionate affair with Cecil Parkin before she married Jack, which ended when Cecil was called up to serve in the Army. She appears to genuinely love Jack, but she seems to still have buried feelings for Cecil. She frequently resists Cecil's advances, but occasionally relents, even letting him kiss her in Episode 10, but states that it must never happen again. In early episodes it is hinted that Cecil is the father of her daughter, Gloria, but this is proved to be false in Episode 11.\n\nVera Plumtree (Barbara New) Cleaner – She helps the staff by cleaning their homes and washing linen for them. She has a lot in common with Ethel: she muddles her words and frequently talks about her unnamed late husband, who was an engine driver. She is fond of Harry, but he is not interested in her.\n\nWilfred Schumann (Paul Aspden, credited as Paul Aspen) Porter – Ethel's son. Most of the time he comes across as extremely stupid. He is often verbally abused and hit around the head by Jack. Wilfred joins the Army in one episode so as to allow Ethel to elope with her new American airmen boyfriend, but she ends the relationship. Wilfred was born in 1946, making him 17.\n\nGloria Skinner (Lindsay Grimshaw) – Jack and May's daughter. A rebellious teenager, very fond of short skirts and the company of older men. She has a crush on Cecil Parkin, the new station master and Percy, the guard. Jack is over-protective however and will let no man in the station take Gloria out. Gloria was born in February 1945, making her 18.\n\nPercy (Terry John) Guard – the main station flirt. He flirts with every woman he comes into contact with, except Vera. But he seems to prefer Amy above others: he takes her out on several dates during the series, often leaving Ethel in the lurch. We learn in Episode 14 that he keeps promising to take Ethel out, but never does.\n\nArnold Thomas (Ivor Roberts) Train Driver – An older train-driver. He is the star of the penultimate episode, where he goes to great lengths to make sure he is not sacked. He has a wife called Jessica, who appears to be forgetful. He alludes to her in almost every episode, but she only appears briefly in an uncredited role in Episode 13. The actress was Ivor Roberts' real life wife also.\n\nRalph (Perry Benson) Fireman and Trainee Driver – Works with Arnold – the two often engage in comic banter. Ralph can be as daft as Wilfred and is slow at learning to drive – but he drives the train perfectly in the final episode. One episode centres around him – in Episode 14 he threatens to go on strike. It is also revealed that he has a crush on Gloria.\n\nAmy (Tara Daniels), best school friend of Gloria's, she appears in most of the episodes. She is often the object of Percy's desires.\n\nMr Orkindale (Richard Spendlove) District Inspector – Senior to Parkin, calls staff by Christian names and fancies May. Dislikes Mr Parkin as much as everyone else and in Episode 17 cheats him out of a place on the bowls club outing just so he can have a few extra drinks.\n\nOther actors who had previously collaborated with David Croft made guest appearances. A former \"Hi-De-Hi!\" regular Felix Bowness made a number of appearances as train guard Bernie Bleasdale. Windsor Davies appeared in the final episode as the Mayor of Clumberfield, when the station staff re-enacted the station's opening for its 100th anniversary. James Pertwee, son of the actor Bill Pertwee, made an appearance as a photographer in this final episode also. \nSally Grace appeared in Episode 7 as Mr Parkin's fiancée, Edna. Hugh Lloyd made an appearance in one episode as a chauffeur.\n\nThe LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 No 46521 from the Severn Valley Railway was used on the film set and carried the name \"Blossom\". At the time of filming the engine normally resided on the Severn Valley Railway. Blossom was subsequently sold to the Loughborough Standard Locomotive Group, which is based at the Great Central Railway. The engine was on loan to different railways before having an overhaul, after which it returned to service with a main line 'ticket'.\n\nThe title was a reference to the music hall song and Will Hay film \"Oh, Mr Porter!\" and a modified version was sung as the end titles by actress Su Pollard:\n\nThe first series was released on VHS and DVD in 2004 and the second series on DVD only, in 2005. The packaging of the first series was slightly misleading by stating that it \"included the pilot\", but it really contained the revised first episode and not the original version of the pilot.\nOnly series one was ever released on VHS.\n\nA complete box set containing both series and all 19 episodes (also including the original pilot) was made available, distributed by Acorn Media UK in 2009. It was later discontinued but it was made available again in 2017.\n\n"}

It has been confused with \"B. smithi\"; both have been called Mexican redknee tarantulas. Many earlier sources referring to \"B. smithi\" either do not distinguish between the two species or relate to \"B. hamorii\". \"B. hamorii\" is a terrestrial tarantula native to the western faces of the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges in the Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco, and Michoacán. The species is a large spider, adult females having a total body length over and males having legs up to long. Mexican redknee tarantulas are a popular choice for enthusiasts. Like most tarantulas, it has a long lifespan.\n\n\"Brachypelma hamorii\" is a large spider. A sample of seven females had a total body length (excluding chelicerae and spinnerets) in the range . A sample of 11 males was slightly smaller, with a total body length in the range . Although males have slightly shorter bodies, they have longer legs. The fourth leg is the longest, measuring in the type male and in a female. The legs and palps are black to reddish black with three distinctly colored rings, deep orange on the part of the patellae closest to the body with pale orange–yellow further away, pale orange–yellow on the lower part of the tibiae, and yellowish-white at the end of the metatarsi. Adult males have light greyish-red around the border of the carapace with a darker reddish-black marking from the middle of the carapace to the front of the head; the upper surface of the abdomen is black. Adult females vary more in carapace color and pattern. The carapace may be mainly black with a brownish-pink border, or the dark area may be broken up into a \"starburst\" pattern with pale orange–yellow elsewhere.\n\n\"Brachypelma hamorii\" was initially misidentified as the very similar \"B. smithi\", a species originally described in 1897. In 1968, the holotype of \"B. smithi\" was found to be an immature male, and in 1994, A. M. Smith redescribed \"B. smithi\" using two adult specimens. The specimens cannot now be found, but his description makes it clear that they actually belonged to what is now \"B. hamorii\", not \"B. smithi\". \"B. hamorii\" was first described by Marc Tesmoingt, Frédéric Cleton and Jean Verdez in 1997. They stated that it was close to \"B. smithi\", but could be distinguished by a number of characteristics, including the spermathecae of the females. However, following Smith's description, \"B. hamorii\" continued to be misidentified as \"B. smithi\" until the situation was clarified by J. Mendoza and O. Francke in 2017.\n\nThe two species have very similar color patterns. When viewed from above, the chelicerae of \"B. hamorii\" have two brownish-pink bands on a greyish background, not visible on all individuals. \"B. smithi\" lacks these bands. Mature males of the two species can be distinguished by the shape of the palpal bulb. When viewed retrolaterally, the palpal bulb of \"B. hamorii\" is narrower and less straight than the broad, spoon-shaped one of \"B. smithi\". It also has a narrower keel at the apex. In mature females of \"B. hamorii\", the baseplate of the spermatheca is elliptical, rather than divided and subtriangular as in \"B. smithi\"; also, the ventral face of the spermatheca is smooth rather than striated.\n\nDNA barcoding has been applied to Mexican species of \"Brachypelma\". In this approach, a portion of about 650 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I is used, primarily to identify existing species, but also sometimes to support a separation between species. In 2017, Mendoza and Francke showed that although \"B. hamorii\" and \"B. smithi\" are similar in external appearance, they are clearly distinguished by their DNA barcodes.\n\n\"B. hamorii\" grows very slowly and matures relatively late. The females of this species can live up to 30 years, but the males tend to live for only 5 years or so.\n\nLike all tarantulas, \"B. hamorii\" is an arthropod, and must go through a molting process to grow. Molting serves several purposes, such as renewing the tarantula's outer cover (shell) and replacing missing appendages. As tarantulas grow, they regularly molt (shed their skin), on multiple occasions during the year, depending on the tarantula's age. Since the exoskeleton cannot stretch, it must be replaced by a new one from beneath for the tarantula to grow. A tarantula may also regenerate lost appendages gradually, with each succeeding molt. Prior to molting, the spider becomes sluggish and stops eating to conserve as much energy as possible. Its abdomen darkens; this is the new exoskeleton beneath. Normally, the spider turns on its back to molt and stays in that position for several hours, as it pushes fluids just beneath its old exoskeleton and wiggles its limbs to loosen off the old and reveal the new exoskeleton. Once this has been accomplished, the tarantula does not eat for several days to weeks, and not uncommonly for up to a month after a molt, as its fangs are still soft; the fangs are also part of the exoskeleton and are shed with the rest of the skin. The whole process can take several hours and sheaths the tarantula with a moist, new skin in place of an old, faded one.\n\nLike most New World tarantulas, they kick urticating hairs from their abdomens and their back legs if disturbed, rather than bite. They are only slightly venomous to humans and are considered extremely docile, though, as with all tarantulas, their large fangs can cause very painful puncture wounds, which can lead to secondary bacterial infection if not properly treated and allergies may intensify with any bite.\n\n\"B. hamorii\" and the very similar \"B. smithi\" are found along the Pacific Coast of Mexico on opposite sides of the Balsas River basin as it opens onto the Pacific. \"B. hamorii\" is found to the north, in the states of Colima, Jalisco, and Michoacán. The natural habitat of the species is in hilly deciduous tropical forests. It constructs or extends burrows under logs, rocks, and tree roots, among thorny shrubs and tall grass.\n\nTheir burrows were described in 1999 by a source that did not distinguish between \"B. hamorii\" and \"B. smithi\". The deep burrows keep them protected from predators, such as the white-nosed coati, and enable them to ambush passing prey. The females spend the majority of their lives in their burrows, which are typically located in, or not far from, vegetation, and consist of a single entrance with a tunnel leading to one or two chambers. The entrance is just slightly larger than the body size of the spider. The tunnel, usually about three times the tarantula's leg span in length, leads to a chamber that is large enough for the spider to safely molt. Further down the burrow, via a shorter tunnel, a larger chamber is located where the spider rests and eats its prey. When the tarantula needs privacy, e.g. when molting or laying eggs, the entrance is sealed with silk, sometimes supplemented with soil and leaves.\n\nIn 1985, \"B. smithi\" (then not distinguished from \"B. hamorii\") was placed on CITES Appendix II. Wild-caught specimens shipped for the Chinese market were decreasing in size. The smaller sizes were suspected to be a consequence of a declining population due to excessive export. Exporting is not the only threat, though; some local people have reportedly made a habit of killing these spiders in a nearly systematic way using pesticides, pouring gasoline into burrows, or simply killing migrating spiders on sight. The reasons for these actions seem to be an irrational fear based on myth surrounding \"B. hamorii\" and related species. Thus, whether the listing strengthened the wild population or not remains uncertain. The species has been bred successfully in captivity. In 1994, all remaining \"Brachypelma\" species were added to Appendix II. Large numbers of Mexican redknee tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico. At least 3,000 specimens of Mexican tarantulas were reported to have been sent to the United States or Europe a few years prior to 2017, most of which were Mexican redknee tarantulas.\n\n"}

This is the lowest of the 4 possible ratings.\n\nThere are approximately 680 pupils in attendance at the school including those in the sixth form. The school was officially opened in March 1962 (although pupils had been attending since the previous September) to move the Tyn-y-Wern Secondary School from Trethomas. Originally, the school was a community school under Monmouthshire County Council but when county boundaries were revised in 1973, it became one of 46 comprehensive schools in Mid Glamorgan.\n\nAs a result of local Government reorganisation in 1996, it became one of 16 comprehensive schools in Caerphilly County Borough. From September 2007, as the result of closure of two of the secondary schools in the Borough (Bedwellty in 2005 and St Ilan in 2007), it became one of 14 secondary schools.\n\nThe school serves the community to the east of the River Rhymney. This is made up of the villages of Bedwas, Trethomas, Graig-y-Rhacca and Machen. The school has five feeder schools in its designated catchment area (including Plasyfelin from September 2007) but, in addition, approximately 10% of the pupils come to Bedwas High School from outside the catchment area.\n\nBedwas High School is an English-medium 11 to 18 mixed comprehensive school situated to the east of Caerphilly. The school serves the communities from the villages of Bedwas, Trethomas, Graig-y-Rhacca and Machen. The number of pupils has increased from 694 at the time of the last inspection to the current 752. Around 26% of pupils are entitled to free school meals, which is higher than the national average of 17.4%, and 41% of pupils live in 20% most deprived areas of Wales.\n\nThe pupils entering the school represent the full range of ability and around 22% have a special educational need. This figure is higher than the national average of 18.6%. Around 3% of pupils have statements of special educational needs. This compares with 2.6% for Wales as a whole. A very few pupils receive support to learn English as an additional language and a very few pupils come from minority-ethnic backgrounds. A very small number of the pupils speak Welsh as their first language. The headteacher has been in post since September 2008. Following the retirement of the school's deputy headteacher Mrs Sue Rivers, the school appointed a new deputy headteacher, Mr Tom Stancombe, in September 2012.\n\nIn March 2019, the school came out of special measures, which followed the 2017 Esytn inspection, and moved into monitoring.\n\n"}

It was superseded by the Mark 46 torpedo, beginning in the late 1960s. The Royal Australian Navy, however, continued to use it alongside its successor for a number of years, because the Mark 44 was thought to have superior performance in certain shallow-water conditions.\n\nIt has been deployed by many navies and air forces including the USN, Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Air Force from various launch vehicles. These include long-range maritime patrol aircraft, e.g. P-3 Orion, RAF Nimrod, Canadair Argus, LAMPS and other embarked naval helicopters, ASROC missiles, Ikara missiles.\n\nDuring the 1950s the US Navy ordered development of a new generation of lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes. Two programs were started, the EX-2A at the Naval Ordnance Test Station Pasadena (NOTS-Pasadena) and the EX-2B at General Electric Ordnance Department, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The EX-2A was to have its counter-rotating propeller driven directly by an electric motor, while the EX-2B was to use a gas turbine connected to a gearbox.\n\nAfter an accident with the proposed fuel for the EX-2B (Propyl Nitrate) the US Navy ordered the halting of its use. This resulted in the EX-2B development team shifting to an electric motor using the design for a jet engine starter motor as the basis to give the high torque and RPM the counter-rotating gearbox needed. The shroud design around the control surfaces of the EX-2B was also redesigned, as it was discovered that having the shroud around the control surfaces themselves reduced their effectiveness, as a result the length of the shroud was reduced.\n\nAfter several evaluations the EX-2B was selected and designated the Mark 44 Mod 0. After some fine tuning of the design, an enhanced version the Mark 44 Mod 1 entered United States service in 1956. However shortly after the torpedo entered service it became apparent that newer Soviet submarines were both faster and deeper diving, and could potentially both outrun and out-dive the Mk.44 which was designed to attack targets with a maximum speed of only 17 knots. To address this an operational requirement was issued in 1960 resulting in the acceptance into service of the Mk.46 torpedo in 1963, when it began to replace the Mk.44 in U.S. service.\n\nA number of upgrade packages have been offered for the torpedo, a 1986 Honeywell kit replaced the magnetostrictive transducers with ceramic transducers in a planar array, and the replacement of the analogue guidance electronics with a digital system. The overall effect of these changes was to triple the searched volume of the torpedo by increasing detection range by 75% and reducing the minimum shallow water search depth by 47%. With this modification the torpedo is known in South Korea as the KT44.\n\nA South African package offered an extensive upgrade, replacing the warhead with a 45 kilogram shaped charge device capable of penetrating 40 millimeters of steel behind a 1.5 meter water filled double hull. The package also included a comprehensive digital electronics upgrade tripling the target acquisition range to 1,000 meters in ideal conditions, and containing a number of counter-counter measures along with a variety of attack modes.\n\nThe torpedo is, however, coming to the end of its usable life as the batteries have expired in many of the torpedoes. The New Zealand navy retired its Mark 44s in 1993 because it decided against renewing the batteries.\n\nThe Mark 44 is a modular design, consisting of four main sections. The blunt nose contains the active sonar seeker with the 75-pound (34 kg) high-explosive warhead immediately behind it. The second section contains the guidance and gyroscopes. The third contains the 24 kilowatt seawater battery which uses silver chloride and magnesium electrodes with seawater acting as the electrolyte. Finally is the propulsion section which houses the electric motor, four rectangular control fins and two contra-rotating propellers.\n\nThe vacuum tube-based guidance system is more sophisticated than earlier torpedoes, using pre-launch settings enabling an initial search depth of 50, 150, 250, 450, 650 or 900 feet as well as a search floor at 150, 250, 450, 650 or 900 feet as well as a maximum dive/climb angle of 4.5, 6 or 7 degrees. On impacting the water the torpedo either runs out for 1,000 yards or performs a dive at a 30-degree angle to the search depth.

Introduced by the German firm Flettner, servo tabs were formerly known as Flettner tabs. Servo tabs are not true servomechanisms, as they do not employ negative feedback to keep the control surfaces in a desired position; they only provide a mechanical advantage to the pilot.\n\nA servo tab moves in the direction opposite to the desired movement of the control surface. It deflects airflow, generating force on the whole control surface in the desired direction.\nThe tab has a leverage advantage, being located well aft of the control surface hinge line, and thus its airflow deflection moves the control surface in the opposite direction, overcoming the resistance generated by the airflow deflection of the control surface. This has the effect of reducing the control force required from the pilot to move the controls.\n\nIn some large aircraft, the servo tab is the only control that is connected to the pilot's stick or wheel, as in the Bristol Britannia and its Canadian derivatives. The pilot moves the wheel, which moves the servo tab; the servo tab with its mechanical advantage moves the elevator or aileron, which is otherwise free-floating. With the \"geared spring tab\" variant, a pilot is able \"to maneuver a vehicle weighing as much as 300,000 pounds flying at an airspeed of 300 miles per hour or more\".\n\nAn anti-servo tab, or anti-balance tab, works in the opposite way to a servo tab. It deploys in the same direction as the control surface, making the movement of the control surface more difficult and requires more force applied to the controls by the pilot. This may seem counter-productive, but it is commonly used on aircraft where the controls are too light or the aircraft requires additional stability in that axis of movement. The anti-servo tab serves mainly to make the controls heavier in feel to the pilot and also to increase stability. An anti-servo tab also functions as a trim device to relieve control pressure and maintain the stabilator in the desired position.\n\n\n"}

It is unusual for its experimental style, expanding even further on the jazz fusion sound of Mitchell's \"Hejira\" from the year before. Mitchell has stated that, close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, she allowed this album to be looser than anything she'd done previously.\n\n\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\" was released in December 1977 to mixed reviews, but managed to peak at #25 on the \"Billboard\" charts and attained gold record status within three months.\n\nMuch of the album is experimental, but especially so are: \"Overture,\" played with six simultaneous guitars, some in different tunings from others, with vocal echo effects; \"The Tenth World,\" an extended-length instrumental of Latin percussion; and \"Dreamland,\" which features only percussion and voices (including Chaka Khan).\n\nMost experimental of all is \"Paprika Plains,\" a 16-minute song played on improvised piano and arranged with a full orchestra; it takes up all of Side 2. In it, Mitchell narrates a first-person description of a late-night gathering in a bar frequented by Indigenous peoples of Canada, touching on themes of hopelessness and alcoholism. At one point in the narrative, the narrator leaves the setting to watch the rain and enters into a dreamstate, and the lyrics – printed in the liner notes but not sung – become a mixture of references to innocent childhood memories, a nuclear explosion and an expressionless tribe gazing upon the dreamer. The narrator returns inside after the rain passes. In speaking to Anthony Fawcett about working on \"Paprika Plains,\" Mitchell said:\n\n\"The Improvisational, the spontaneous aspect of this creative process – still as a poet – is to set words to the music, which is a hammer and chisel process. Sometimes it flows, but a lot of times it's blocked by concept. And if you're writing free consciousness – which I do once in a while just to remind myself that I can, you know, because I'm fitting little pieces of this puzzle together – the end result must flow as if it was spoken for the first time.\"\n\nTwo of the album's tracks had previously been released: \"Jericho\" by Mitchell on her 1974 live album \"Miles of Aisles\" and \"Dreamland\" by Roger McGuinn on his 1976 album \"Cardiff Rose\".\n\n\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\" attracted contributions from prominent jazz musicians, including four current members of Weather Report – Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Manolo Badrena, and Alex Acuña.\n\nThe album jacket is a photomontage and includes three photographs of Mitchell. In the foreground she is in blackface as her \"reputed alter ego, a black hipster named Art Nouveau.\"\n\nMusicians\n\nProduction\n"}

{"id": "1911992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911992", "title": "State highways in Oregon", "text": "State highways in Oregon\n\nThe state highway system of the U.S. state of Oregon is a network of highways that are owned and maintained by the Highway Division of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT).\n\nThe state highway system consists of about 8,000 miles (13,000 km) of state highways (roadways owned and maintained by ODOT), with about 7,400 miles (12,000 km) when minor connections and frontage roads are removed. This is about 9% of the total road mileage in the state, including Oregon's portion of the Interstate Highway System (729.57 mi/1,174.13 km) and many other highways ranging from statewide to local importance. Transfers of highways between the state and county or local maintenance require the approval of the Oregon Transportation Commission (OTC), a five-member governor-appointed authority that meets monthly. These transfers often result in discontinuous highways, where a local government maintains part or all of a main road within its boundaries.\n\nTwo separate numbering systems are used; routes (e.g. Interstate 84, U.S. Route 26, and Oregon Route 140) are those used by the general public, and their shields are posted on guide signs and maps. These comprise the Interstate highways, U.S. Routes, and Oregon Routes (e.g. OR 201). Highways, on the other hand, are used internally by ODOT; they are named and numbered (e.g. Pacific Highway No. 1, Willamette Highway No. 18). The two systems, while largely overlapping, are not congruent. Many \"routes\" are signed on streets which are maintained by counties and cities, and thus are not part of the state \"highway\" system at all, e.g. OR 8, whose eastern- and westernmost portions, Canyon Road and Gales Creek Road, are not actually state highways. On the other hand, some state \"highways\" are not signed as \"routes\" at all; Beaverton-Tualatin Highway No. 141 has an official route designation (OR 141), but remains entirely unsigned. Signed routes may comprise several highways; for instance, OR 47 is overlaid on Mist-Clatskanie Hwy No. 110, Nehalem Hwy No. 102, and Tualatin Valley Highway No. 29. Likewise, highways may consist of several routes; Tualatin Valley Hwy No. 29 comprises parts of OR 8 and OR 47. Every highway is fully state-maintained, and every route is at least partially state-maintained.\n\nThe OTC designates the paths of these routes as they follow state highways and local roads; any U.S. Route or Interstate numbers must also be approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Route signs are maintained by the same agency as the roads they are posted along. If a local government maintains a numbered route, it signs an agreement with the state to keep the signs posted, thus keeping a continuous route for the benefit of travelers.\n\nThe initial primary state highway system was designated in 1917, initially consisting of 36 named and numbered highways, including some designated earlier that year by the Oregon State Legislature and others added to the network by the Oregon State Highway Commission, the predecessor to the OTC. The first signed routes were the U.S. Routes, in 1926. It was not until 1932 that Oregon Routes were numbered by the OTC and marked by the Oregon State Highway Department; every primary state highway that was not already part of a U.S. Route received a route number at that time. Starting in late 1931, the state took over maintenance of many county \"market roads\", which became secondary state highways with three-digit numbers; some of these were assigned route numbers in 1935, but many others remained unsigned.\n\nThe primary, two-digit route numbers were laid out in a grid system, similar to the Interstate Highway System. Odd-numbered routes were north-south and increased in number bearing west, ranging from OR 3 in Wallowa County to OR 53 in Clatsop and Tillamook counties. Even-numbered routes were east-west and increased in number bearing south, ranging from OR 6 in Tillamook and Washington counties to OR 70 in Klamath County. East-west highways in eastern Oregon were given route numbers between OR 74 and OR 86, again increasing in number to the south. Despite this pattern, the internally used highway numbers for primary highways remained ad-hoc. A few route numbers were added after the 1930s, and broke these patterns for continuity reasons: OR 99, OR 126, OR 138, and OR 140.\n\nSecondary route numbers, three digits starting with 2, were laid out to generally increase bearing west. They ranged from OR 201 in Malheur County to OR 240 in Yamhill County. The internally used highway numbers for secondary highways were also three digit numbers, but were designated by county, from No. 10X in Clatsop County, No. 11X in Columbia County, No. 12X in Multnomah County, etc., until No. 45X in Malheur County. In 2002 and 2003, ODOT decided to assign route numbers to most of the previously unsigned secondary highways. Typically, these new route numbers were identical to the old highway numbers, and range from OR 103 to OR 454. In cases where the highway number was already in use by a different route, the first digit of the new route number was changed to 5 (e.g. Cape Arago Hwy No. 240, designated OR 540 in 2003). Most of these new route numbers are unsigned as of 2015.\n\nTwo state highways lack route numbers: Century Drive Hwy No. 372 and Midland Hwy No. 420.\n\nThe following highways were constructed and/or planned, and then subsequently demolished or cancelled. In some cases, the cancellation resulted from freeway revolts.\n\nThese projects represent proposed new major routes within the state of Oregon. Improvements to existing facilities are not included in this list.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1911995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911995", "title": "Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital", "text": "Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital\n\nThe Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital is a children's hospital located within the grounds of the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton on the south coast of England. It provides outpatient services, inpatient facilities, intensive care and a 24-hour emergency care service for children referred by GPs and other specialists. It is managed by the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust.\n\nThe hospital originally stood on Dyke Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton. Local architect Thomas Lainson's red-brick and terracotta building, in the Queen Anne style, was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1881. It remained in use for more than a century before being replaced by a new building at the main Royal Sussex County Hospital site. The new facility opened in June 2007, and has won architectural awards for its innovative design.\n\nThe future of the Dyke Road site has been uncertain since the move to the new premises was first considered in 2001; Lainson's buildings and their later additions were threatened with demolition until 2009, when a developer was refused planning permission to replace the hospital with flats. Brighton & Hove City Council's latest planning briefs state that any redevelopment of the site should incorporate Lainson's original building.\n\nHospitals dedicated to the treatment of children have existed in England since the mid-19th century: the first opened in Liverpool in 1851. By this time, Brighton was a rapidly growing town with a history of proactively establishing social, educational and medical institutions. In response to a meeting at Brighton Town Hall on 23 June 1868, local doctor R.P.B. Taaffe founded the town's first children's hospital, the Brighton Hospital for Sick Children, at 178 Western Road on 3 August of that year. Two years later, it moved to the former Church Hill School, a disused building on Dyke Road; Bishop of Chichester Richard Durnford conducted the reopening ceremony on 14 July 1871. Although this had 20 beds in the main ward, an eight-bed ward for bone disorders and an isolation ward for infectious diseases, within ten years it was felt necessary to move to another larger building.\n\nThomas Lainson, who entered practice in the early 1860s, was a prolific and eclectic local architect. By 1880, his works included residential terraces in the Italianate style, places of worship in diverse styles (Romanesque Revival and Neo-Byzantine), a High Gothic working men's club and an Italianate villa. His buildings often incorporated multicoloured brick and dressings of terracotta. In about 1881, he went into partnership with two of his sons, Thomas J. and Arthur, who worked together as \"Lainson & Sons\".\n\nLainson won the commission for the new hospital in 1880 by submitting a design for a Queen Anne style building of red brick and terracotta. His sons joined him in designing and building it; this lasted until 1881 and cost £10,500 (£ in ), and the hospital was formally opened on 21 July 1881. The Prince and Princess of Wales and their daughters Princess Louise, Princess Victoria and Princess Maud were in attendance; Dr Taaffe changed the name of the hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children in honour of the Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark). The new building stood at the junction of Dyke Road and Clifton Hill in the Montpelier area of Brighton.\n\nThe building was added to many times; none of these changes were by Lainson & Sons. Nurses' quarters were built in 1896; a two-storey extension, with isolation and outpatient facilities, opened in 1904, increasing the capacity to 114 patients; additional wings were added in 1928 and 1945 (the latter opened by Princess Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth II); and the nurses' quarters became another ward in 1966.\n\nThe first proposal to relocate the hospital came in 2001, when the Secretary of State for Health Alan Milburn allocated £28 million to move its services to the Royal Sussex County Hospital site in Eastern Road in the Kemptown area. The money was part of a £1,100-million hospital-building programme which the Labour government intended to fund through the use of public–private partnerships. The scheme was put on hold for nearly a year until February 2002, when the government confirmed that £25 million was available and permitted the NHS trust responsible for the Royal Alexandra (at the time, the Brighton Health Care NHS Trust) to seek a private finance partner. In August 2002, the trust put the contract for the new hospital's design and construction out to competitive tender. Applications were received from 26 companies; the trust selected a shortlist of four from these in October 2002. Architecture firm Building Design Partnership and the European division of Japanese company Kajima were selected for the design and construction processes respectively.\n\nDetails of the new building were announced in January 2004—at which point it was also stated that Lainson's buildings on the Dyke Road site would be demolished. Three operating theatres, an intensive care unit, X-ray facilities and 100 beds were planned. Meanwhile, developers expressed interest in the Dyke Road site, hoping to acquire and demolish the hospital and redevelop the prime central location with flats. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey paid £10 million for the site in December 2006, and planned to build a mixture of houses and flats (including some affordable housing); they submitted a planning application for a 149-unit development incorporating a doctor's surgery, but Brighton & Hove City Council refused planning permission in December 2008 and again (on appeal) in June 2009. The planning officer who made the decision stated that the proposed development was too large in scale for the site, affected nearby open space and appeared \"bulky [and] overbearing\". The majority of local residents wanted the old buildings to be retained, according to a locally produced survey earlier in 2006, and a residents' association applied to English Heritage for the granting of listed status, which would have given protection against demolition and significant alteration. This was not granted, because Lainson's original building had been altered so much that its original architectural character had been lost, but its situation within the Montpelier and Clifton Hill conservation area still gave some protection. (The Council's Conservation Area Character Statement of 2005 stated that the hospital was \"an important part of Brighton life and a well known local landmark\".) In March 2010, the council published a planning statement which required the main building (Lainson's original) to be retained as part of any future redevelopment of the site. Later buildings, such as the former nurses' accommodation, were not covered by this. Taylor Wimpey submitted new plans to retain Lainson's main building but use most of the site for housing. These were approved by Brighton and Hove City Council in February 2011. Work could not start, though, until the council reached agreement with the company over £350,000 of funding towards educational and transport improvements. Several months later, when development had still taken place, the building was falling into decay and was reportedly close to collapse, as squatters and thieves regularly broke in to occupy the building and strip lead from the roof. This prompted the council to serve notice on Taylor Wimpey to tidy the site, make it secure and improve the appearance of the buildings.\n\nConstruction of the new hospital started in July 2004 and cost £36 million. The new building opened in June 2007, and the Dyke Road site was officially closed on 22 June 2007. To make way for the new facilities, the Royal Sussex County Hospital's renal unit had to be demolished; it was rebuilt on top of the multi-storey car park. On 31 January 2012, comedian Steve Coogan opened a paediatric accident and emergency unit—Southeast England's first such department dedicated to children. The accident and emergency department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital had previously treated both adults and children.\n\nThe new hospital won an award for the \"Operational Project with the Best Design\" at the Public Private Finance Awards in 2008, and won the 2008 Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award—a government award sponsored by the Office of Government Commerce and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. Judges considered that the design was cleverly executed on a difficult site, and incorporated elements appropriate to its seaside setting.\n\nAs of 2020, the Royal Alexandra Hospital is one of seven children's hospitals in Great Britain.\n\nThomas Lainson's building of 1880–81 was in a Shavian interpretation of the Queen Anne style, which he and his sons used again in later buildings in the area (such as the Belgrave Hotel of 1882 and in their work on the Vallance Estate in Hove in the early 1890s). The three-storey building is mostly of red brick with some terracotta dressings. Lainson made extensive use of ornate decorative mouldings on the east-facing main façade, which is not symmetrical and has a Dutch gable. Another decorative feature was a cartouche which commemorated the Royal Family members present at the opening. The south-facing secondary façade has conventional gables, large chimneys and a pair of cupola-topped turrets at one end. Another local firm, Clayton & Black, added a colonnade on this side in 1906. In 1927, the north side was extended in a style which matched Lainson's work: W.H. Overton's design included gables with half-timbering and tile-hanging. The 1904 extension, consisting of isolation facilities and outpatients' accommodation, was in the Vernacular/Domestic style with half-timbered gables with jettying, prominent mullions and transoms to the bay windows, and a small tower.\n\nThe new hospital, designed by Building Design Partnership, is in the form of an ark, and has a \"nautical theme\" appropriate to the seafront location. The exterior has curved corners and is clad in white precast concrete, intended to evoke the painted stucco which is closely associated with Brighton's seafront Regency architecture. The fenestration is irregular: many windows are at a low level to improve visibility for children. The building has a naturally lit central atrium.\n\nSince 1954, the hospital's patron has been Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy (styled Princess Alexandra of Kent until 1963).\n\n\n\n"}

When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer invited him to Hollywood as a director, he arrived with his new discovery Greta Gustafsson, whose screen name Greta Garbo is believed to have been his suggestion.\n\nAfter frequent disagreements with studio executives at MGM and Paramount Pictures, Stiller returned to Sweden, where he died soon afterwards. \n\nMoshe Stiller was born in Helsingfors (now Helsinki). His family was of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, having lived in Russia and Poland before settling in Finland, these countries being part of the Russian Empire. When he was four, his mother committed suicide, after which he was raised by family friends. From an early age, Stiller was interested in acting. His talents did not go unnoticed, and soon Stiller was offered the opportunity to practice and display his acting skills in the theaters of Helsingfors and Åbo in Finland.\n\nDrafted into the army of Czar Nicholas II — Finland was at the time an autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, part of Russia — rather than report for duty he fled the country for exile, and settled in Sweden. He became a Swedish citizen in 1921.\n\nBy 1912, Stiller had become involved with Sweden's rapidly developing silent film industry. He began by writing scripts, acting and directing in short films but within a few years gave up acting to devote his time to writing and directing. He was soon directing feature-length productions, and his 1918 work \"Thomas Graals bästa barn\" (\"Thomas Graal's First Child\"), starring Karin Molander, and with Victor Sjöström in the leading role, received much acclaim.\n\nBy 1920, having directed more than 35 films, including \"Sir Arne's Treasure\" and \"Erotikon\", Stiller was a leading figure in Swedish filmmaking. He also directed \"The Blizzard\" starring a young Einar Hanson and based on the Selma Lagerlöf novel \"En herrgårdssägen\".\n\nAt the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, he met a young actress named Greta Gustafsson whom he cast in an important but secondary role in his film, \"Gösta Berlings saga\" (\"The Atonement of Gosta Berling\"), and who some have said gave her the stage name Greta Garbo. For Stiller, the screen presence of the 18-year-old actress led to him bringing her and Hanson to the United States after he accepted an offer from Louis B. Mayer to direct for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIn Hollywood, Mauritz Stiller was assigned to direct \"The Temptress\" (1926), Garbo's second film with MGM, but he could not deal with the studio structure. After repeated arguments with MGM executives, he was replaced on the film by Fred Niblo, and his contract with the studio terminated. Stiller immediately was hired by Paramount Pictures, where he made three successful films, but he was let go a second time while directing his fourth film because of his continuing disagreements with studio bosses.\n\nMauritz Stiller returned to Sweden in 1927 and died the following year from pleurisy at the age of 45. He was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.\n\nStiller's contribution to the motion picture industry was recognized in 1960 with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1713 Vine Street. Originally his star was listed erroneously as \"Maurice Diller\" and wasn't corrected until the late 1980s. In Kristianstad, a monument was erected in his honor.\n\n"}

Interstate and U.S. Highways are continuous with surrounding states, while state highways are not (though Oklahoma and another state's department of transportation may coordinate numbering).\n\nThe majority of the numbered highways within Oklahoma are maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT). The only exceptions are sections of Interstate 44 (I-44) and U.S. Highway 412 (US-412), which run along turnpikes maintained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA). (I-44 runs along the H.E. Bailey, Turner, and Will Rogers turnpikes; US-412 is signed along the Cimarron and Cherokee turnpikes.)\n\nIndividual counties may establish a numbering system to apply to roads that they maintain. These highways are not listed here.\n\nOklahoma's state highways serve as the second-lowest tier on the Oklahoma road system. They are marked with a number contained inside an outline of the state, having been formerly marked inside a white circle in a black box until January 2006.\n\nSH-81 has not been issued for a state highway so that is not confused with US Highways and Interstates bearing the same number designation. SH-35 has been issued, but it is only for a short spur, far from I-35. SH-60, SH-62, SH-69, and SH-75 were once assigned but these designation have since been revoked. Other two-digit highways that have yet to be assigned include: SH-12, SH-13, SH-21, SH-41, SH-57, SH-61, SH-68, and SH-90. SH-40 was once issued, but was absorbed into U.S. Highway 177; see SH-40A. SH-41, which was an east-west route across west-central Oklahoma that began at the intersection of S.W. 29th and May Avenue in Oklahoma City and veered southwest to Mustang, Union City and Minco before continuing west through Binger, Eakly, Cordell and Sayre and then crossing the Texas border near Sweetwater, was redesignated as SH-152 over its entire length in 1955. Across the Texas Panhandle, the highway continues as TX-152 to Dumas, Texas. SH-61 had a strange east-west route across south-central Oklahoma that started at SH-13 (Now SH-3W). Where it headed south, passing through Vanoss and then to Roff, where it turned east to Fittstown. It then headed south with SH-99 until turning east again. The road turned north in Jessie. It went north until it turned back east north of Stonewall It turned east again until it ended on SH-48 in Luna.\n\nMany Oklahoma state highways have short spur routes connecting them to towns which lie off of the main route. Many times, these bear the same number as the parent highway, with a letter suffix. Some state highway spurs and loops from US highways have designations that are drawn from the parent US Highway designation.\n\nAs higher-level roads replaced sections of some routes, those sections sometimes had their designation revoked. This led to some highways being fragmented, missing one or more sections in the middle of the road. There are also a few unrelated highways that are designated in completely different parts of the state with the same number.\n\n"}

The show addresses a wide range of issues from news, politics, arts and culture, health, technology, environmental, and business topics, to many others.\n\nIt is distributed to over 290 public radio stations across the United States by NPR. \"On Point\" averages more than two million podcast downloads a month.\n\nThe show was originally created by Graham Griffith, and first broadcast on September 17, 2001, to provide special coverage in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The show's popularity led to it becoming a standalone program, first broadcasting under the \"On Point\" name on 4 February 2002.\n\nTom Ashbrook was the long-running host from 2002 to 2017. Prior to that he was a foreign editor at \"Boston Globe\". \n\nAshbrook hosted most weeks during his time with the show, but went on medical leave in November 2007, to undergo heart bypass surgery. He resumed full-time broadcasting January 2, when he discussed his medical journey in a show with his doctors and nurses.\n\nOn November 5, 2014, Ashbrook announced a period of personal leave to care for his wife, Danielle, who had been suffering from cancer. She died the next day, November 6, 2014, at age 60. After nearly two months away, Ashbrook returned to \"On Point\" on January 2, 2015.\n\nAshbrook was put on leave from \"On Point\" at the beginning of December of 2017, when a group of current and former WBUR employees alleged he created a \"toxic and emotionally unsafe work environment\" for staff through bullying and publicly humiliating colleagues. Specific allegations filed by initially 11 (and later \"at least 23\" ) staffers included \"Tirades directed at young women in the studio, name-calling, belittling critiques of show ideas during meetings, 'creepy' sex talk, inappropriate touching, hugs and back or neck rubs after a dressing down.\". Ashbrook denies the allegations. In 2018 the program commenced being hosted by fill-in hosts including Ray Suarez and Jane Clayson.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, WBUR announced they had dismissed Ashbrook as a result of the complaints of the work environment.\n\nOn July 25, 2018, WBUR's Meghna Chakrabarti (host of the local program \"Radio Boston\") and David Folkenflik (NPR's media correspondent) were announced as the new hosts of the program starting August 20. Chakrabarti will host Mondays through Thursdays while Folkenflik will host Fridays and remain as NPR's media correspondent.\n\nThe show traveled to Shanghai, People's Republic of China, to broadcast a week of programming from April 14 to 18, 2008. Topics ranged from the Beijing Olympics to Chinese cinema. Among the guests were leading China analysts, officials and journalists. A new website was launched to coincide with the trip.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2008 presidential campaign, the show interviewed Barack Obama, John McCain, Mike Huckabee, John Edwards, Ron Paul, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd and Sam Brownback. Election commentators included Donna Brazile, Tom Brokaw, Bob Shrum, Dana Milbank, Tony Fabrizio, Joe Klein, EJ Dionne, Pat Buchanan, Peter Hart, and Hendrik Hertzberg. The show traveled to both the Democratic and Republican conventions, broadcasting live in the morning and at night.\n\n\"On Point\" is broadcast live from Boston, Massachusetts on WBUR FM (90.9 MHz) from 10 a.m. to 12 noon ET, occupying the former time slot of \"The Connection\", and repeated from 7 to 9 p.m. Most frequently, each two-hour broadcast is divided into two separate hour-long standalone segments, with the first hour tending to be more serious and news driven, and the second often focusing on an entertainment figure or cultural phenomenon. The host interviews guests who are experts on topics being discussed, and listeners are invited to call in discuss their thoughts.\n\nThe first hour segment of Friday's show almost always consists of an analysis of the previous week's news headlines. The Friday news analysis segments usually feature senior editor of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and historian Jack Beatty as a news analyst, as well as, typically, two or three other guest commentators.\n\nJane Clayson, former CBS morning anchor and correspondent, is commonly the show's fill-in host; NPR's Jacki Lyden, John Harwood, Anthony Brooks, Jessica Yellin, James Hattori, and Ray Suarez have also hosted.\n\nIt is led by senior producer Karen Shiffman and directed by Eileen Imada.\n\nThe \"On Point\" theme music, \"Everything Is Alright\", comes from the Four Tet album \"Pause\".\n\n"}

They are often grown as an ornamental in front yards, parks, gardens, buildings etc. due to their bright yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. They are also known as Golden wonder tree, American cassia, Popcorn tree, Cassia excelsa, Golden shower tree or Archibald's cassia.\n\nThe plant has become an invasive alien specie in parts of Africa such as Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda after it was introduce for resources such as firewood as well as to help combat deteriorating ecosystems affected by deforestation and desertification. Currently, \"S. spectabilis\" is overtaking native tree species of forestry ecosystems around the world because of its ability to grow quickly. . \n\n\"S. spectabilis\" was long placed in \"Cassia\", or in the non-monophyletic \"Cathartocarpus\" assemblage, or separated - together with its relative \"Senna peralteana\" - in \"Pseudocassia\". In addition, it has been variously treated under a range of taxa, some of which were also used for related plants:\n\n\nIn addition, one or two varieties of this species are recognized:\nThe taxonomic tree of \"Senna spectabillis\":\n\n\n\"S. spectabilis\" has a few medicinal properties. The plant can be used as a treatment for ringworm and skin diseases. After extracting a leaf on alcohol there was significant antifungal activity, which suggests it can be used with infections caused by Candida albicans. The plant is effective against food borne pathogen B. \"Senna spectabilis\" also produces several substances that we deem necessary for metabolism, in which they are also used as a medicine or pharmaceutical drug. Pharmaceuticals that can produce piperidine alkaloids, pentacyclic terpenoids, and anthraquinones. It is also used in both eastern and western traditional medicine treating several different diseases and symptoms. \n\n\"Senna spectabilis\" is also used as a medicinal plant in Cameroon by traditional healers to treat epilepsy, constipation, insomnia, and anxiety. In a recent study, the anticonvulsant effects of \"Senna sepctabilis\" was observed on mice undergoing seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES), pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and pilocarpine (PC). It was discovered that the mice undergoing PTZ induced seizures were protected 100% of the time when administered the lowest plant dose. In another experiment on differing doses, the plant offered protection up to 75% of the time on antagonized seizures induced by PC. The study concluded that Senna spectabilis contains anticonvulsant activity, most likely acting on the GABA complex receptor. \n\nOther non medical related uses, \"S. spectabilis\" is used in agroforestry as a shade tree. The species is useful for fodder, mulch, fuelwood, and as a source of honey. The heartwood is brown and the sapwood is white-ish. The wood is heavy, soft, and hard, when kept dry can be resistant to termites. For this reason \"S. spectabilis\" is often used for economic reasons. The wood is used for tool handles, boxes, furniture, lumber and other construction materials. The wood is also used as fuel wood and to make charcoal.\n\nAlso, \"S. spectabillis\" was introduced to Africa as an ornamental and a boundary marker. It's not highly valued but it does produce good quality firewood.\nSenna spectabillis can invade disturbed forests, forest egdes, and gaps where it can establish and suppress the regeneration of native species. \n\n\"Senna spectabilis\" is a shrub or deciduous tree that can grow anywhere from 15-20 ft in height and 15-20 ft in width. \"S. spectabilis\" have a rounded vase-shaped crown, which is dense and symmetrical. Senna Spectabilis is pollinated by bees and has a very fast growth rate. \n\nFoliage\n\nA rounded, evergreen foliage, arranged alternatively. The leaf type is odd-pinnately compound with pinnate leaf venation and 4-15 pairs of leaflets each growing up to be 7.5 cm. The leaves are green and yellow in color and remains as so year around. The leaf blades grow between 2-4 inches long and experience a circadian rhythm or nyctinasty, closing at night and opening at dawn. \n\nFlower and fruit \n\nBright yellow inflorescence 10-50 cm long containing a corolla 3.5-4 cm in diameter with five unequal petals. The flowers are very showy producing elongated pod shaped fruits about 6-12 inches in length. The fruit is a dry dehiscent, black/brownish in color containing numerous flat brown seeds, 0.5 cm in diameter. \n\nTrunk and branches \n\nMultiple trunks with diameters of up to about 30 cm. The branches are droopy with smooth grey bark having horizontal markings. As the plant matures it develops many warts and broad vertical bands of lenticels . In the first year of development the stem is finely hairy.\n\n\"S. spectabilis\" ' is native from South America first found in eastern tropical Brazil and coastal Ecuador, eventually migrating throughout Central America as well as the West Indies in forests from up to 2000 m of altitude.\n' Their habitats include rain forest, semi-deciduous and dry forest, montane forest, and dry valleys. The plant requires full sunlight and well-drained soil to grow. \"S. spectabilis\" can flourish in a variety of different soils from moist, clay, sand, loam, slightly alkaline, and acidic soils even in poor black cotton soils. However it has difficulties adapting to soils with high aerosol salt concentrations. There are no known diseases that affects the plant. Today the specie can be found all around the world due to its invasive nature. This specie is present in the following countries: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 January 2020 The Hindu \n\n"}

This species is sometimes called the Guyana pinktoe, common pinktoe, or South American pinktoe.\n\nThe mature pinktoe tarantula has a dark-colored body and pinkish feet, hence its name. Juvenile specimens, however, have pinkish bodies and dark-colored feet. Pinktoe tarantulas undergo a reversal in their coloration as they approach adulthood at 4–5 years. They are sit-and-wait predators, with limited activity.\n\nBeing arboreal species, they require a relatively tall habitat with plenty of climbing space in captivity. They require a lot of moisture, along with ample ventilation to prevent molds from developing.\n\nThey have a short lifespan and usually live between 7-9 years. \n\nThey are known to lure in their victims through the process of stationization, the act of remaining in a trance-like state until moment of attack. A full grown pinktoe tarantula can grow up to six inches in length. Their first reaction when threatened is usually to run or leap away, but they may react defensively if provoked (as with any theraphosid). Their venom is considered mild, even compared to other new-world tarantulas.\n\nAlthough this species is often rumoured to be communal, housing them in groups will almost inevitably lead to cannibalism over time.\n\n"}
{"id": "1912076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912076", "title": "Polygonal modeling", "text": "Polygonal modeling\n\nIn 3D computer graphics, polygonal modeling is an approach for modeling objects by representing or approximating their surfaces using polygon meshes. Polygonal modeling is well suited to scanline rendering and is therefore the method of choice for real-time computer graphics. Alternate methods of representing 3D objects include NURBS surfaces, subdivision surfaces, and equation-based representations used in ray tracers.\n\nThe basic object used in mesh modeling is a vertex, a point in three-dimensional space. Two vertices connected by a straight line become an edge. Three vertices, connected to each other by three edges, define a triangle, which is the simplest polygon in Euclidean space. More complex polygons can be created out of multiple triangles, or as a single object with more than 3 vertices. Four sided polygons (generally referred to as quads) and triangles are the most common shapes used in polygonal modeling. A group of polygons, connected to each other by shared vertices, is generally referred to as an element. Each of the polygons making up an element is called a face.\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, any three non-collinear points determine a plane. For this reason, triangles always inhabit a single plane. This is not necessarily true of more complex polygons, however. The flat nature of triangles makes it simple to determine their surface normal, a three-dimensional vector perpendicular to the triangle's surface. Surface normals are useful for determining light transport in ray tracing, and are a key component of the popular Phong shading model. Some rendering systems use vertex normals instead of face normals to create a better-looking lighting system at the cost of more processing. Note that every triangle has two face normals, which point to opposite directions from each other. In many systems only one of these normals is considered valid – the other side of the polygon is referred to as a backface, and can be made visible or invisible depending on the programmer’s desires.\n\nMany modeling programs do not strictly enforce geometric theory; for example, it is possible for two vertices to have two distinct edges connecting them, occupying exactly the same spatial location. It is also possible for two vertices to exist at the same spatial coordinates, or two faces to exist at the same location. Situations such as these are usually not desired and many packages support an auto-cleanup function. If auto-cleanup is not present, however, they must be deleted manually.\n\nA group of polygons which are connected by shared vertices is referred to as a mesh. In order for a mesh to appear attractive when rendered, it is desirable that it be non-self-intersecting, meaning that no edge passes through a polygon. Another way of looking at this is that the mesh cannot pierce itself. It is also desirable that the mesh not contain any errors such as doubled vertices, edges, or faces. For some purposes it is important that the mesh be a manifold – that is, that it does not contain holes or singularities (locations where two distinct sections of the mesh are connected by a single vertex).\n\nAlthough it is possible to construct a mesh by manually specifying vertices and faces, it is much more common to build meshes using a variety of tools. A wide variety of 3D graphics software packages are available for use in constructing polygon meshes.\n\nOne of the more popular methods of constructing meshes is box modeling, which uses two simple tools:\n\n\nA second common modeling method is sometimes referred to as inflation modeling or extrusion modeling. In this method, the user creates a 2D shape which traces the outline of an object from a photograph or a drawing. The user then uses a second image of the subject from a different angle and extrudes the 2D shape into 3D, again following the shape’s outline. This method is especially common for creating faces and heads. In general, the artist will model half of the head and then duplicate the vertices, invert their location relative to some plane, and connect the two pieces together. This ensures that the model will be symmetrical.\n\nAnother common method of creating a polygonal mesh is by connecting together various primitives, which are predefined polygonal meshes created by the modeling environment. Common primitives include:\n\nFinally, some specialized methods of constructing high or low detail meshes exist. Sketch based modeling is a user-friendly interface for constructing low-detail models quickly, while 3D scanners can be used to create high detail meshes based on existing real-world objects in almost automatic way. These devices are very expensive, and are generally only used by researchers and industry professionals but can generate high accuracy sub-millimetric digital representations.\n\nThere is a very large number of operations which may be performed on polygonal meshes. Some of these roughly correspond to real-world manipulations of 3D objects, while others do not. Polygonal mesh operations include:\n\n\nOnce a polygonal mesh has been constructed, further steps must be taken before it is useful for games, animation, etc. The model must be texture mapped to add colors and texture to the surface and it must be given a skeleton for animation. Meshes can also be assigned weights and centers of gravity for use in physical simulation.\n\nTo display a model on a computer screen outside of the modeling environment, it is necessary to store that model in one of the file formats listed below, and then use or write a program capable of loading from that format. The two main methods of displaying 3D polygon models are OpenGL and Direct3D. Both of these methods can be used with or without a 3D accelerated graphics card.\n\nThere are many disadvantages to representing an object using polygons. Polygons are incapable of accurately representing curved surfaces, so a large number of them must be used to approximate curves in a visually appealing manner. The use of complex models has a cost in lowered speed. In scanline conversion, each polygon must be converted and displayed, regardless of size, and there are frequently a large number of models on the screen at any given time. Often, programmers must use multiple models at varying levels of detail to represent the same object in order to cut down on the number of polygons being rendered.\n\nThe main advantage of polygons is that they are faster than other representations. While a modern graphics card can show a highly detailed scene at a frame rate of 60 frames per second or higher, surface modelers, the main way of displaying non-polygonal models, are incapable of achieving an interactive frame rate (10 frame/s or higher) with a similar amount of detail. With sprites, another alternative to polygons, every required pose must be created individually, while a single polygonal model can perform any movement if the appropriate motion data is applied, and can be viewed from any angle.\n\nA variety of formats are available for storing 3D polygon data. The most popular are:\n\n\n"}

She is best known for being the co-creator (along with Tony Holland) of the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", also working as a director and the first producer of the series.\n\nLondon-born Smith became involved in television production when she directed the series \"Suspense\" in 1962. She went on to direct popular BBC shows such as \"Z Cars\" (in 1962) and \"Doctor Who\" (in 1966), for which she directed the stories \"The Smugglers\" and \"The Underwater Menace\". In 1967 she directed an adaptation of \"The Railway Children\" with Jenny Agutter that was successful enough for it to lead to the fondly remembered 1970 film in which Agutter reprised her role of Roberta.\n\nWhile working on \"Z Cars\" she had met Tony Holland, who was a writer for the show. The two of them became an established producer/script-editor team and went on to work for the BBC's long-running hospital drama \"Angels\" (1975) from 1979 to 1983.\n\nIn 1983 the BBC contacted Smith and Holland to create a new popular bi-weekly serial drama. Two ideas were given to them, one about a caravan site, the other about a shopping arcade. Neither of them liked either of the ideas and demanded to be able to create something about what they \"knew\"—in the words of Smith—\"London - today!\"\n\nTogether they came up with the idea of a serial set in the East End of London in a Victorian Square. When casting for the show, Smith had the guideline 'Only genuine Eastenders need apply'; it was this that gave her the idea for the name of the show, which would be called \"EastEnders\" after other names were rejected. Originally the show was to be called \"Eastenders\", but Jonathan Powell, then Head of Drama at the BBC who had commissioned the show, made the tentative suggestion that the second \"e\" didn't look good on paper, and said that perhaps it should be capitalized. It was, for which Smith later said \"...we were eternally grateful to him!\"\n\nTraditionally, the end music to \"EastEnders\" begins with dramatic drums, but occasionally, especially when a character departs, a piano introduction is used. This is called Julia's Theme, after Julia Smith.\n\nHer final contribution to EastEnders, along with that of fellow creator Tony Holland, came in early 1989, amid a dispute with BBC bosses as to whether the character of Den Watts (played by Leslie Grantham) could ever return to the show after being shot and supposedly killed. The character would ultimately return to the series, having apparently survived the shooting, but Smith would not live to see this happen.\n\nAfter the success of \"EastEnders\", Smith and Holland collaborated again on the ill-fated BBC soap opera \"Eldorado\". Holland created the series — based on an original idea by Verity Lambert—and Smith was producer. Eldorado was produced by Lambert through her own company \"Cinema Verity Productions\". The BBC obviously hoped that, after \"EastEnders\", Smith and Holland could make drama gold again; however, the series was cancelled by the new controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob. Smith was blamed for the programme's shortcomings and was fired, which left her bitter towards the BBC, who she believed had not given \"Eldorado\" a chance to establish itself. Corinne Hollingworth took over as series producer after Smith left the show, but the series was ended after only one year.\n\nFollowing the demise of \"Eldorado\", Smith retired from television work. She died of cancer in Kensington and Chelsea, London, in 1997. Several stalwart cast members of \"EastEnders\", including Wendy Richard, attended her funeral.\n"}

His first wife died in 1862, leaving four young children.\n\nDoran was elected county treasurer of Le Sueur County on the Democratic ticket in 1862, serving four successive terms. In 1864, he married his second wife, Catherine O'Grady. Nine children were born of this marriage.\n\nIn 1870, Doran was elected state senator from Le Sueur County and served several terms. In 1870 he moved from Kilkenny township to Le Sueur, Minnesota, and entered the banking business. In 1875, he went into the milling business at Le Sueur. Late in the 1870s, he entered into partnership in a banking and brokerage business in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHe lived in Le Sueur until 1888, when he sold out his local interests, and moved to St. Paul, where he continued with his banking concerns.\n\nDoran was chairman of the Minnesota Democratic State Central Committee on numerous occasions and was chairman of the National Democratic Committee from 1888 to 1896, when he resigned over differences with his party on bimetallism. He was a close political and personal friend of Grover Cleveland, who gave him the principal credit for procuring his third presidential nomination in 1892.\n\nDoran died in St. Paul in 1915. He is the namesake of the city of Doran, Minnesota.\n\n"}

Planning for a class of vessels to replace the fifteen s began in 1993 as a joint project with the Royal Malaysian Navy, but was cancelled when Malaysia pulled out of the process. The project was reopened in 1999 under the designation SEA 1444, with the RAN as the sole participant. Of the seven proposals tendered, the Austal/Defence Maritime Services (DMS) proposal for twelve vessels based on an enlarged was selected. Two additional boats were ordered in 2005 to provide a dedicated patrol force for the North West Shelf Venture.\n\nAll fourteen vessels were constructed by Austal at Henderson, Western Australia. The first vessel, , was commissioned into the RAN in June 2005, and the last, , entered service in February 2008. The \"Armidale\"-class ships are operated by the Australian Patrol Boat Group, and based in Cairns and Darwin. They are primarily tasked with border protection, fisheries patrols, and the interception of unauthorised arrivals by sea. The \"Armidale\"s are longer and heavier than their \"Fremantle\"-class predecessors, with improved seakeeping ability and increased range, allowing them to reach Australia's offshore territories. The ships are multi-crewed, with three ship's companies available for every two vessels, allowing the patrol boats to spend more time at sea without cutting into sailors' rest or training time.\n\nDuring their early service life, there were problems with the fuel systems across the class, and a 20-bunk auxiliary accommodation compartment has been banned from use after toxic fumes were found in the compartment on multiple occasions. The high operational tempo from the Operation Resolute and Operation Sovereign Borders border protection and asylum seeker interception operations, combined with design flaws and poor maintenance, resulted in the ships suffering from hull fracturing around the engineering spaces, mechanical defects, and corrosion issues. DMS's contract to provide in-service support will be terminated in 2017, and the patrol boats are undergoing a major refit in Singapore to reinforce the hull. Two s have been chartered to supplement naval patrol boat availability during the refit cycle, and plans to replace the \"Armidale\"s with an enlarged class of offshore combatant vessel have been accelerated to bring them into service by the early 2020s.\n\nAfter extensive damage from an onboard fire, was decommissioned at the end of 2014. A fictional \"Armidale\"-class boat, HMAS \"Hammersley\", appears in the Australian military drama series \"Sea Patrol\" from the second season onwards, with filming occurring aboard multiple ships of the class.\n\nPlanning for the \"Armidale\" class began in 1993, as a plan to replace the , which was due for retirement in 1998. This evolved into a joint program with Malaysia to construct an offshore patrol craft. When Malaysia pulled out, the plan was scrapped, and the \"Fremantle\"s underwent a life-extending refit. The cost of maintaining the aging vessels prompted the Department of Defence to create the Replacement Patrol Boat program, which received the procurement project designation SEA 1444.\n\nSEA 1444 marked several departures from the department's standard acquisition requirements. Instead of specifying a number of vessels, the coverage of 3,000 ship-days per year (with 1,800 to be spent on border protection operations, and a surge capability of 3,600 days) was given, with the producer to determine how many ships were needed to meet this. The ships had to meet specific performance parameters, such as the ability to conduct boarding operations in conditions up to Sea State 4, and to maintain surveillance capability up to Sea State 5. The producer was also required in the contract to provide support and maintenance for the ships, for fifteen years after construction completed.\n\nNine companies expressed interest in the project; of these, seven had the required capability to build the ships. These seven were narrowed down to three based on each tender's merit, competitiveness with the other tenders, and successful meeting of Australian industry involvement targets for both construction and long-term support. Austal and Defence Maritime Services (DMS) partnered to offer twelve ships based on an expanded version of the latter's , in use with the Australian Customs Service. The companies submitted two proposals for a vessel, one with a steel hull, and one with an aluminium hull; the latter offering a 21% reduction in fuel consumption. Australian Defence Industries (ADI) tendered a design based on the Royal Danish Navy's . The vessel was to be built with a glass-reinforced plastic hull, similar to ADI's s. The Tenix proposal was a variant of a search and rescue vessel constructed for the Philippine Coast Guard. The tender was awarded to the Austal/DMS partnership in December 2003. The contract was valued at $553 million, with each ship costing between $24 million and $28 million to construct.\n\nDuring the 2004 federal election, the Howard government promised to acquire two more patrol boats to provide a dedicated patrol force for the North West Shelf Venture located off the north-west coast of Australia. These were ordered in 2005. The order was placed in June 2006.\n\nAll fourteen boats were constructed by Austal at its shipyard in Henderson, Western Australia. Lead ship was commissioned into the RAN in June 2005. Two other patrol boats were delivered to the RAN in 2005, six in 2006, and five in 2007, with the final ship in the class, , delivered in October 2007 and commissioned in February 2008. At one stage, six vessels were being constructed simultaneously.\nEach patrol boat has a length of , a beam of , a draught of , and a standard displacement of 300 tons. The hull is of the semi-displacement vee type, and is fabricated from aluminum alloy. The ship is designed to a combination of Det Norske Veritas standards for high-speed light craft and RAN requirements: much effort went into avoiding attempts to overengineer the \"Armidale\"s or turn them into 'miniature warships'.\n\nThe \"Armidale\"s can travel at a maximum speed of , and are driven by two propeller shafts, each connected to an MTU 4000 16V diesel engine, providing . The ships have a range of at , allowing them to patrol the waters around the distant territories of Australia, including the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. The \"Armidale\" class has demonstrated an improved seakeeping ability over the preceding \"Fremantle\" class: the \"Armidale\"s are longer, 85 tons heavier, and have hydraulic stabiliser fins and trim tabs incorporated into the design, allowing them to survive conditions up to Sea State 9. The vessels are designed for standard patrols of 21 days, with a maximum endurance of 42 days.\n\nThe main armament of the \"Armidale\" class is a Rafael Typhoon stabilised gun mount fitted with an M242 Bushmaster autocannon. This cannon has a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute, and is controlled remotely from the bridge. Two machine guns are also carried.\n\nBoarding operations are performed by two , waterjet propelled rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIB), which carry ten people (a fully equipped, eight-strong boarding party, and two boat crew). The RHIBs are larger and more powerful than the single RHIB aboard a \"Fremantle\", are capable of operating independently of their mothership, and carry their own communications, navigation, and safety equipment. Each RHIB has a dedicated cradle and davit, the boats can be launched and recovered easily, and a centralised 'dressing room' incorporated into the ship's design has streamlined the deployment and return of personnel.\n\nThe patrol boats are fitted with a Bridgemaster E surface search and navigational radar, a Toplite electro-optical detection system, and a Warrlock direction finding system. A Prism III radar warning system was fitted to the last two boats during construction, and refitted to the rest. Tenders for a Naval Unmanned Aerial System (NUAS) capability for the \"Armidale\" class were requested in mid-2014.\n\nEach patrol boat has a standard ship's company of 21 personnel, with a maximum of 29 (not including use of the austere compartment). Unlike the \"Fremantle\"-class patrol boats, the \"Armidale\"s do not have a permanently assigned ship's company. Instead, there are 21 crews established for the 14 \"Armidale\"-class patrol boats, which are divided up into four divisions: \"Attack\", \"Assail\", \"Ardent\", and \"Aware\". The first three of the Divisions are assigned six crews for four ships, while \"Aware\" has three crews for two ships. The ships are continually manned, with two out of three crews actively deployed while the third undergoes leave or training, or prepares to transfer into a ship: a handover can be accomplished in less than six hours. The intention of multi-crewing is to allow the ships to spend more time at sea, without compromising sailors' rest time or training requirements.\nJunior sailors are housed in four-berth cabins, as opposed to the central sixteen-berth mess deck of the \"Fremantle\"s, while senior sailors and commissioned officers either have individual or share two-berth cabins. Personnel have access to e-mail and satellite television, and the galley is better equipped than that on a \"Fremantle\"-class vessel and better suited to use in heavy seas. The comfort of personnel is also significantly improved over the \"Fremantle\"s, with air conditioning throughout the entire ship (excluding engine and machinery compartments).\n\nThe introduction of the class into service has not been without problems. Since June 2005, all active \"Armidale\"s have undergone operating restrictions on two occasions, both due to water contamination of the main fuel systems. The first occurrence, in September 2006, led to the suspension of operations by the patrol boats for a month, and the engineering controls were redesigned. The problem occurred again in January 2007, and led to an 'operational pause' while Austal redesigned the fuel system, engineering procedures were altered, and fuel quality criteria were tightened. The five ships yet to be completed were fitted with the modified fuel system during construction, while the active ships were refitted over the course of 2007. As of December 2007, no further fuel problems have occurred.\n\nA 20-berth auxiliary accommodation compartment (the 'austere' compartment) was included in the design, for the transportation of soldiers, illegal fishermen, or unauthorised arrivals; in the latter two cases, the compartment could be secured from the outside. However, a malfunction in the sewage treatment facilities aboard in August 2006 pumped hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide into the compartment, non-fatally poisoning four sailors working inside. Use of the compartment as accommodation was banned across the class, and is still in effect as of January 2014. In 2010, allegations were made to \"The Australian\" that a sailor working in the austere compartment on a different vessel had been gassed with hydrogen sulphide, and carbon monoxide was regularly detected in the enclosed space. Following publication of the allegations, Chief of Navy Russ Crane claimed that there was no record of the alleged gassing incident, and while there were ongoing incidents of poisonous gasses detected in the compartment, the sensors were set to trigger well below dangerous levels, and modifications were being made to the sewerage and ventilation systems.\n\nIn 2014, the navy reported the recurrence of hull cracking around the engine spaces, which has been attributed to a combination of design issues related to the aluminium hull, and the high tempo of operations. By 2015, several patrol boats were confined to port because of structural, mechanical, and corrosion issues. In response, the Department of Defence threatened to cancel DMS' maintenance contract based on the company's poor performance in maintaining the \"Armidale\"s (but did not go ahead due to the political repercussions from potentially losing local jobs). Defence and Serco (the parent company of DMS) later agreed to end the contract in 2017, with the Australian government to tender for a new in-service support contract during 2016. The patrol boat fleet began a mid-life refit program in October 2015, in order to extend hull life until a replacement class of larger vessels enters service from 2022. Patrol boats are being refitted two at a time in Singapore, with the RAN chartering the s \"Cape Byron\" and \"Cape Nelson\" from mid-2015 until the end of 2016 to supplement naval patrol boat availability. During work on the first two patrol boats, the estimated cost of work-per-vessel doubled to A$7 million.\n\nThe \"Armidale\"-class ships are operated by the Australian Patrol Boat Group and are primarily tasked with border protection and fisheries patrols. As of 2009, up to seven \"Armidale\"-class boats are assigned to patrols of Australian waters at any given time as part of Operation Resolute (and later Operation Sovereign Borders), with an increase to nine of the fourteen vessels when required. \"Ardent\" Division and four ships are based at in Cairns, while the other three divisions and ten ships are located at in Darwin. Up to two ships (typically HMA Ships and , plus \"Aware\" Division) can be forward-based at Dampier, Western Australia, facilitating patrols of the oil and gas producing facilities located off the north-west coast of Australia.\n\nAt the start of 2014, the long transit differences and near-constant deployment of the patrol boats for Operation Resolute was impacting on the ability to keep the vessels properly maintained.\n\nIn August 2014, a fire broke out aboard while undergoing refit work at a civilian shipyard in Hemmant, Queensland. The patrol boat was extensively damaged, and was decommissioned on 18 December.\n\nIn November 2017 the RAN began deploying \"Armidale\"-class patrol boats to the Philippines. The boats have been used to conduct counter-terrorism patrols in the Sulu Sea with the Philippine Navy.\n\nFrom the second season onwards of \"Sea Patrol\", an Australian military drama series, the fictional \"Armidale\"-class patrol boat HMAS \"Hammersley\" (pennant number 82) is used as the main setting. In 2008, two ships were conflated to represent \"Hammersley\": 42 of the 86 days of filming were spent aboard , with later pick-up filming aboard .\n\n\"\", the 2009 Department of Defence white paper, proposed replacing the \"Armidale\"s, along with the RAN's mine warfare and hydrographic vessels, with a single class of multi-role offshore combatant vessels (OCVs). These vessels, with a theoretical maximum displacement up to 2,000 tonnes, would use a modular mission payload system to change between roles as required, and would be equipped for helicopter or unmanned aerial vehicle operations. The 2013 white paper postponed the multi-role OCV as a long-term project.\n\nThe 2013 white paper proposed that an existing OCV design be sourced as a short-term replacement for the \"Armidale\" class. Procurement project SEA 1179 is undertaking several studies towards the replacement of the \"Armidale\"s. A design is yet to be selected as of 2015, but the replacement OCV will be larger than the \"Armidales\", providing improved seakeeping and endurance. Construction is predicted to start in 2018, with entry into service from 2022. A hull remediation program was implemented to extend the lifespans of the patrol boats to this point.\n\nBooks\n\nJournal and news articles\n\nPress releases\n\nWebsites\n\n"}

He was the head of the AUVA-Hospital in Vienna, Brigittenau, that was later named after him: Lorenz-Böhler-Unfallkrankenhaus. This hospital was an international model during his time as the leading surgeon there. \n\nIn radiology, the measurement of \"Böhler's angle\" on a foot X-ray can help detect fractures of the calcaneus.\n\nAt the early age of 5 Böhler – son of a family of craftspeople – knew he wanted to become a surgeon.\nWhen he was a little boy he used to anatomize small birds and squirrels. On 6 December 1896 an X-ray of a hand by Wilhelm Röntgen was published in \"Das interessante Blatt\" magazine. Lorenz Böhler saw it, cut it out and stuck it on his reading book.\nIn 1896 he attended the fürsterzbischöfliche Knabenseminar in Brixen. After two years he left that school and attended secondary school in Bregenz, where he had to repeat the third grade. He graduated in 1905.\nHe started his studies in medicine in 1905 at the University of Vienna.\nIn 1910 he met his wife—a nurse—at Bregenz's hospital where he was working as a trainee.\nOn 1 July 1911 Böhler became Doctor of Medicine at Vienna's University.\n\nFor a short time (1911—and then again in 1919, 1920) Lorenz Böhler was working at the clinic of surgeon Julius Hochenegg, who was his Professor at University. Hochenegg was one of the first doctors who had a department for accident surgery in his clinic.\n\nSince September 1911 Böhler worked as a physician on a ship for a few months, until he started to work at the garrison's hospital at Ragusa, where he became a k. u. k. substitute medical assistant. There he mostly did bacteriological work.\nIn Autumn 1912 he became an assistant doctor at the hospital in Brixen and in April 1913 he became assistant doctor in Tetschen an der Elbe.\n\nIn 1914 Lorenz Böhler went to an international surgeons congress in New York City. On his way to the congress he met Belgian doctor Albin Lambotte, who told him about surgical methods of fracture treatment.\nAfterwards Böhler spent some time at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, where he met Charles Horace Mayo. Mayo told him about the centres of fracture treatment at London and Liverpool. There was nothing like this in the German-speaking part of Europe. Mayo gave Böhler a commendatory letter for Arbuthnot Lane in London, who was one of the leading European doctors in surgical fracture treatment, but the breakout of World War I made it impossible for Böhler to visit Lane.\n\nShortly after conscription Böhler wanted to work as a surgeon and so he did: From 1914–1916 he was working as a surgeon at the Divisions-Sanitäts-Anstalt Nr. 8 der Tiroler Kaiserjäger and in August 1916 he became the leading surgeon at a military hospital for minor casualties in Bozen.\n\nThough he wasn't allowed to treat shot fractures he managed to get soldiers with broken bones and was able to treat them very successfully so he finally was allowed to treat them and the military hospital was expanded to a special station for bone fractures and renamed \"Spezialabteilung für Knochenschussbrüche und Gelenkschüsse\". There Lorenz Böhler was able to realize some of his most groundbreaking ideas: everything got specialized and standardized, records were kept for later (statistic) analyses, the most important information got written on the plaster and the patients got sorted according to their kind of physical injury, and those who were able to do some kind of work had to help at the military hospital.\n\nBöhler had seen the chaos in other military hospitals where patients were lying higgledy-piggledy which of course caused difficulties in treating them.\n\nFor a short time in 1918 Böhler was in Italian war captivity and had to work as an advisory surgeon for Italian military hospitals.\n\nBack in Austria Böhler wanted to establish special stations for casualty treatments. Therefore, he approached the Arbeiterunfallversicherungsanstalt (AUVA) (labourer's accident insurance) in Vienna and tried to explain the (both medical and economic) advantages which it would have if the AUVA would have an own specialized hospital. Though the AUVA agreed with Böhler the project wasn't realized until 1925. The AUVA-hospital opened on 1 December 1925 in Vienna Webergasse 2–6. Böhler (meanwhile he was working as a surgeon in Bozen and Brixen) became the head of the hospital.\n\nBöhler's reputation as a surgeon increased, especially abroad, while some of his colleagues in Vienna rejected him. \nEncouraged by the \"American Medical Association of Vienna\" (A.M.A.) he wrote the first edition of his book on bone fractures and modern techniques to deal with them called \"Treatment of fractures\" – which became his classic work – in 1929. \nOn 29 March 1930 Böhler was promoted to professor at the University of Vienna. There he was teaching surgery and accident treatment. On 3 August 1936 he became an associate Professor.\n\nLittle is known about Lorenz Böhler's life during the Second World War. On 25 May 1938 he became a member of the NSDAP (No. 6.361.999). In the summer of 1939 he was one of the 13 physicians of Vienna's University (7 professors and 6 private lecturers) who signed a protest letter against the suggested move of the A.M.A. from Vienna to London claiming \"... that we the undersigned, know of not one case of persecution of a professor for his racial or religious adherence. ... It could rather be said that by the removal of certain influences a trend of charlatanism, which was beginning to damage the reputation of the Vienna medical clinics in the eyes of serious medical men, was eliminated\".\n\nDuring World War II Böhler was \"inter alia\" working as an advisory surgeon for the Wehrmacht and at the Rudolfspital in Vienna, where he was the head of the surgery department and of a specialized military hospital for bone fractures.\n\nBöhler was one of the scientists who continued a successful career as Professor (in 1954 he became a professor) and physician (publishing many medical papers), despite his membership in the Nazi Party. He remained the head of the AUVA-hospital Until 1963. His son Jörg Böhler, also a surgeon, was the head of the AUVA-hospital from 1970 to 1983.\n\nBöhler's aim was to: \n\nThis should be achieved by:\n\nBöhler rejected the methods of treatment which had been popular at this time: electricity, hot air and massage.\n\n\nIn 1940 Böhler was elected a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. The new building for the Accident Hospital opened in 1972, and was named after him (Emergency Hospital Vienna Lorenz Böhler). A street in Vienna's 20th District (Brigittenau) was also named for him.\n\nHe been an honorary member of 33 worldwide associations.\n\nIt is said that Lorenz Böhler published more than 400 scientific papers\n\nHis magnum opus \"Treatment of Fractures\" (1929) wasn't a big success at first. Medical specialist printers refused to publish it, so Böhler asked the bookseller Wilhelm Maudrich (jun.) to help him. Böhler had to pay the printing cost and finally the book – though it was criticized by some of Böhlers colleagues – became a top seller. Wilhelm Maudrich then became a medical specialist printer Verlag Maudrich. \nIt was translated into eight languages: English, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Hungarian, Polish and Chinese.\nThe book originally had 176 pages. In 1957 it had already been 2.500 pages. Lorenz Böhler constantly worked on it, updated and expanded it.\n\nSome of his other publications:\n\n\n"}

The church was later vandalized by anti-Proposition 8 protesters, although many churchgoers were opposed to the ballot initiative.\n\nFor many years, Most Holy Redemer was the home of Father William Young, one of the very few priests in the Bay Area qualified to celebrate the Tridentine Mass. Father Young celebrated this weekdays at Most Holy Redeemer, and each Sunday at St. Vincent's Holy Rosary Chapel in Marinwood.\n\nIn the 1980s, the neighborhood was deteriorating and the parish with it. Property values fell and a largely gay population moved in. Seeing the change in the neighborhood, Archbishop John R. Quinn appointed Fr. Tony McGuire as pastor of the church in 1983. McGuire brought together the largely older women who made up most of the remaining congregation and the few gay men who joined the parish. Together they began an outreach to the new gay population of the neighborhood.\n\nAs the AIDS epidemic hit the gay community, the parish began providing services to those in need. The parish paired parishioners with people suffering from AIDS in the neighborhood to give them rides to the doctors, help around he house, or to meet other needs. The older women in the parish were instrumental in this ministry. It became a place \"that helped save souls and helped save lives.\"\n\nIn 1986, a scroll was begun with the names of parishioners who had died of AIDS. Framed photos of some of them line the church.

{"id": "1912130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912130", "title": "Grim Reaper (band)", "text": "Grim Reaper (band)\n\nGrim Reaper are a British heavy metal band from the new wave of British heavy metal era. The band was formed in 1979 in Droitwich, England, by guitarist Nick Bowcott.\n\nThe band formed in Worcestershire and initially featured Paul de Mercado on vocals. Their first album demo tape was called \"Bleed 'Em Dry\" and had an album's worth of material. After developing a following in the north west and Yorkshire they caught the attention of \"Heavy Metal\" records, who added a re-recorded version of \"The Reaper\" from the demo. A positive write up in the Kerrang! 'Armed and Dangerous' section preceded a breakup of the initial lineup, with only Nick Bowcott remaining. He recruited Dave Wanklin on bass, Lee Harris on Drums and most importantly, Steve Grimmett on vocals. This lineup won a 1982 Battle of the Bands competition featuring over 100 bands, winning studio time to demo new material. Grimmett was then the unofficial vocalist for Cheltenham's Chateaux, who were signed to Darryl Johnston's Ebony Records label, so he handed them the Grim Reaper demo tape and the band was signed. Their debut album was \"See You in Hell\". The album was released in 1984 and was distributed worldwide through RCA Records. \n\nGrim Reaper soon became readily identifiable with Bowcott's guitar work and lead vocalist Steve Grimmett's head voice vocals. Their successful world tour included a support show at Texxas Jam playing to over 20,000 people. Their 1985 follow-up, \"Fear No Evil\", showed improvement on the production front and also enjoyed moderate success in both the United States and Europe.\n\nLegal battles with Ebony Records delayed the release of the band's third album \"Rock You to Hell\" by almost two years. The album was released directly through RCA Records in 1987. However, by this time Grim Reaper's melodic heavy metal sound had fallen out of favor as much of the metal market moved toward heavier fare like thrash metal and speed metal. Even the major label distribution and popular video for the title track could not save the band. With the production of their fourth studio album (reportedly to be called \"Nothing Whatsoever to Do with Hell\") about to start, another round of legal action from Ebony Records effectively dealt the death blow to Grim Reaper, subsequently disbanding in 1988.\n\nGrimmett went on to front Onslaught and Lionsheart, as well as perform on several tribute albums. Bowcott became a freelance music writer, and later staff contributor, for publications like Circus and Guitar World. Bowcott also worked with Marshall Amplification's United States division. He also played in the band Barfly who recorded an album with Jack Ponti producing and Michael Wagener mixing for RCA records.\n\nIn 2006, Eddie Trunk announced on Metal Mania that the band has reformed. The \"original\" lineup of Grim Reaper (without Nick Bowcott) played the Keep It True VI festival in Lauda-Königshoffen on 8 April 2006. The band played the annual MetalBrew festival in London's Mill Hill on Saturday 18 July 2009. Later they were scheduled to play at the Play it Loud IV in Bologna, Italy, in September 2009. The festival was then cancelled when the promoter forfeited, but the band (urged on by a crowd of fans who had already bought tickets) managed to play the date along with a number of originally billed acts (as a single-day event instead of a weekend-spanning one).\n\nThe band made a successful appearance at the British Steel festival in Bolognia Italy in November 2010 at the Estragon venue on a bill that included other classic bands of the NWoBHM era - Diamond Head, Girlschool, Demon and Angelwitch. They also played at the Academy Birmingham with the band Jameson Raid.\n\nThe current line-up continues to tour the UK and Europe. They did a short tour of Greece and Cyprus in November 2011 and released the Limited Edition \"Live in Europe 2011\".

{"id": "1912132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912132", "title": "Bari people", "text": "Bari people\n\nThe Bari are a tribe of Karo, Nilotic people inhabiting South Sudan. They are known as the Duor by other communities occupying the savanna lands of the White Nile. The Bari speak the Bari language as a mother tongue, which belongs to the Nilotic family.\n\nThe Bari of the Nile are sedentary agro-pastoralist. They exploit the savanna lands along the river Nile, and up to 40 miles east and west of the Nile. The Bari economy is based on subsistence mixed farming; their domestic livestock (small and large) are mainly raised for supplementing food, but mostly as a socio-economic and financial investment. Notably, livestock are exchanged as gifts in marriages, and other social functions or sacrificed in celebrations, and funerals; and whenever the need arises they are sold for cash.\n\nThe Bari are consistently under pressure: now from modern urbanization annexing their green lands and infusing different cultures into their lifestyles; and historically the Baris have been devastated by slave traders, and forced by Belgians (especially from the Lado Enclave) into labor camps and used as porters to carry ivory tusks to the Atlantic coast. The two Sudanese Civil Wars (1955–1973; 1983–2005) have also affected the Bari social, economic and financial dynamics.\n\nWar (intertribal or resisting foreigners) is not alien to Bari history. Generally, the Bari have co-existed well with the neighboring ethnic groups, but have had to pick up arms to defend their land against slave traders, and plundering warriors. There is documentation of Bari resistance against invasion by Dinka, Azande (Zande), and numerous encounters with Turkish slave traders.\n\nTraditionally the Baris believe in one almighty God and existence of powerful spirits (good and evil). Today the Bari's demography is made up of Christians (Catholics and Protestants), Muslims, and followers of traditional religions (not organized).\n\nIn the past it was a fashion among the Bari to undergo initiation ceremonies. Both boys and girls subjected themselves to removal of lower front teeth. The girls, in addition got tattoos: around the belly area, the flank, the back, and the face (on the temple) in the form of arrow shapes, or simple flowers.\n\nAlong the banks of the Nile, in the heart of the Bari land, lies the historical villages of Mongalla, Lado, Gondokoro (Kondokoro), and Rejaf (Rageef). The capital city of South Sudan, the town of Juba, is also in the Bari land, situated ten miles to the south of Gondokoro, and seven miles to the north of Rejaf.\n\nBased on Bari folklore, the Bari people settled in their current lands prior to the end of the grand trans-migration in Africa. By the time the Luo ethnic groups invaded and migrated through the Bari lands about 1650, the Bari were already sedentary agro-pastoralists, living, and trading with the neighboring ethnic groups.\n\nThe second Expedition to discover the source of the White Nile entered the Bari lands on 24 January 1841. Unfortunately with this progress in the quest for knowledge, came undesirable invaders in the form of European and Turkish traders looking for slaves and ivory. This was the first time Bari encountered Europeans travellers. The Bari were lucky in this encounter, as the Turkish army assigned to protect the Nile explorers behaved, unlike the brutality they unleashed on the ethnic groups (Mondari, Dinka, Shilluk) to the north of the Bari, Pojulu, Kakwa to the South and Kuku to the South-East. However, subsequent expeditions were different.\n\nThe third expedition (1841–42) to discover the source of the White Nile also discovered that Ivory was abundant in the Bari area. From thence onwards, the rush for ivory tusks in the White Nile valley escalated. Initially, both European and Arab traders began sponsoring trips to Gondokoro for ivory. And for a decade the Bari freely sold ivory tusks and other artefacts to the traders without intimidation, and no incidents of slavery was reported by that point in time.\n\nIn April 1854, the peaceful relationship between the traders/explorers and the Bari came to an end when a Turkish trader, without provocation, fired his guns into a crowd of Bari at Gondokoro. Accordingly, the Bari mounted a counterattack that was devastating to both sides. Subsequent to this the Bari became defensive and less friendly, and the traders (mostly Arabs, and Turks) resorted to violent means to procure ivory tusks, but also started taking people (young men and women) as slaves. Girls were raped, or taken as wives by force. Some of the merchants even built fortified depots near Gondokoro where people were kept awaiting shipment down the White Nile.\n\nDiaries of European missionaries in the region, indicate that in the market of Cairo (Egypt), the number of slaves to be sold to Europe from the White Nile area increased from 6,000 between 1858 and 1862, to approximately 12,000-15,000 per annum. These numbers reflected mostly, Bari, Dinka, and Mundari; but also included people of other ethnic groups neighboring the Bari, and beyond were hunting for elephant tusks was intense during that time. By 1863 when Sir Samuel White Baker arrived at Gondokoro, also on an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile, boats of buccaneers (even one flying an American flag) were anchoring at Gondokoro, with the sole purpose of picking up slaves to the new world. By 1865 about 3000 slaves at any one time could be found waiting at Gondokoro to be carried down the Nile.\n\nBaker returned in 1869 with the express purpose of stamping out the slave trade. By this time, the Bari people and land were already devastated. Bari folklore tells us of how long ago the land flanking the Nile was full of strings of villages spread out to the horizon, as far as the eye could see. Baker concurs, in his book \"Ismailia\" (1874), that this had been so when he first visited the area. However he describes how, by the time of his next expedition, the slave traders had reduced the Bari villages to a miserable few. Neither could he obtain co-operation from the Bari, who had been persuaded by Abou Saood, the chief slaver of Agad and Company, who had a government monopoly for trade and slaving, that it was in their best interests to help the slavers and hinder Baker.\n\nEver since then, recovery has been difficult, considering also the fact that the civil wars in 1955-1973; and 1983-2005 have further taken their toll on the Bari.\n\nIn the past, it was not uncommon for the Bari to use intermarriage to form bonds between two families. Although these arrangements were sometimes made when the children were very young, the bride price was not necessarily paid until the betrothed children reached marrying age. Today, marriage among the Bari more often involves a period of courtship followed by consent of the families involved.\n\nAfter a period of courtship, the male suitor usually declares his intent to marry (\"nyara\" in Bari) by presenting himself at the house of the girl's parents, accompanied by a few close relatives and friends. Before the wedding ceremony (\"budu\", typically several months later), the families meet in the bride's parents' house to negotiate the bride price that the bridegroom is obligated to offer; the parents of the bride and bridegroom are never directly involved in these negotiations, though they may be involved indirectly and behind the scenes. Because the Bari have long been agro-pastoralists, the bride price is traditionally paid in the form of live animals. A typical bride price might be composed of two dozen cattle and 40 head of sheep and goats. When the use of animals is too difficult, such as in the case of drought or natural disaster, bride prices in the form of cash may also be acceptable. Behaviors considered disrespectful may increase the bride price during negotiations (though it is also possible for civil courts to get involved); these can include premarital sex, eloping, and aggression towards in-laws. Once the negotiations are successful, both families bless the marriage and commence in a feast that involves drinking and dancing. After the feast, the bridegroom returns home alone, but after about two weeks, the bride arrives to take charge of her house.\n\nFor Bari who have converted to Christianity, an additional step occurs wherein the marriage also receives a church blessing. Ideally, this would occur before the husband and wife begin living together. However, because of the financial burden of having both a Bari traditional wedding feast \"and\" a Christian wedding ceremony, the trend has been to first have the traditional feast and then put off the Christian wedding for a year or longer while the couple saves up money for the occasion. This can be problematic when couples do not also wait to have children, which may be perceived as producing children out of wedlock. While the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) declaration opened the door for adaptation of some African traditional practices into the church, this has not yet led to the formation of a single wedding ceremony for Bari Christians.\n\nThe Bari people speak the Bari language as a mother tongue. It belongs to the Eastern Nilotic subdivision of the Nilo-Saharan family.\n\nBari is a tone language. It has vowel harmony, subject-verb-object word order, and agglutinative verbal morphology with some suppletion.\n\n"}

Established by an occupation of militants in the late 1970s, it is a rare case in which an indigenous people reclaiming land from the United States succeeded. Issues of sovereignty and governmental relations have not been settled.\n\nIn May 1974 traditionalist Mohawks repossessed land near Old Forge, New York, occupying Moss Lake, a girls' camp. They claimed the land under the concept that it had been part of their historic territory in the area, and that New York had made an illegal treaty in 1797 when purchasing land from their leader Joseph Brant.\n\nThese Mohawk had left the Akwesasne, Kahnawake, and other reservations to rebuild traditional lives. The land dispute (as Altona residents and government objected to the Mohawk claim of sovereignty) has not been fully settled. The action was related to rising Native American activism, and specific land claims being filed against New York State by separate nations of the Iroquois. As allies of the defeated British, they had been forced to cede their historic lands to the state after the American Revolution, but the US Senate had never ratified the treaty, making it invalid under the constitution. Some believe that the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua give the Iroquois nations continuing rights to land in the present-day state. The Oneida won a lands claim case, and others continued in negotiation in the late 20th century.\n\nAt the same time, the founding of Ganienkeh was related to Mohawk local issues, as some families wanted to leave the reservation environment. They found it had problems with alcohol and substance abuse, among other issues.\n\nThe three-year armed occupation of the camp ended in 1977 after nearly 200 negotiation sessions with New York state leaders. The Mohawk agreed to move to the territory at Miner Lake, which was offered by New York State through an intermediary trust. Unlike at the ten reservations within the borders of the state, in which federally recognized tribes have a relation with the federal government and the state has no authority over them, the jurisdictional relationships between the tribe and New York have not been defined at this territory. By 1990, the Mohawk still prohibited outsiders from entering the territory.\n\nThis became the settlement of Ganienkeh, with originally about 25 families, about from the Canada–US border. The local townspeople helped supply them with food and other necessities during the first winter. The Mohawk established a \"permanent nonreservation settlement\" and claimed sovereign status. \"Ganienkeh's founding was a rare case of Indigenous people reclaiming land from the United States.\"\n\nGanienkeh spokespeople state it is the only \"Kanienkehaka\" (Mohawk Nation) community that functions solely under the original \"Kaianerehkowa\" (the Constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy) without influence or interference of the United States or Canadian governments. The people claim that the Two Row Wampum (\"Guswhenta\") guarantees Ganienkeh the right to exist as a sovereign entity within the international community. They note that as a sovereign people they may not be taxed by New York or the federal government.\n\nIn 1990 Ganienkeh introduced tax-free bingo, and its 1500-person hall is often filled to capacity. This activity has generated income which the community has invested in economic development projects. (See below.) They also sell cigarettes tax free, thus underselling local retailers.\nThey established the Ganienkeh Holistic Center, which provides classes and education to everyone in the larger community. They also opened the nine-hole Ganienkeh Golf Course, available to players for a fee.\n\nThese businesses are communally operated for the benefit of the Territory. Through regular convened community meetings, every resident of Ganienkeh may participate in the day-to-day government of the community. Ganienkeh is a dry community, prohibiting all recreational drugs and alcohol.\n\n\n"}

The Egyptians attacked the settlement several times throughout May 19 and May 20, but failed to capture it. A final attack was launched on May 23, in which the Egyptians succeeded in capturing part of Yad Mordechai, following which the Israeli defenders withdrew. Yad Mordechai finally fell to the Egyptians on May 24 after hours of bombardment of the vacated kibbutz.\n\nThe kibbutz residents, aided by twenty Hagannah fighters, imposed a five-day delay on the Egyptians. This gave Israeli forces time to prepare for the Egyptians' northward advance, and they succeeded in halting the Egyptian advance at Ad Halom less than a week later.\n\nYad Mordechai is a small kibbutz in southern Israel, founded in the 1930s and renamed in 1943 after Mordechaj Anielewicz, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The kibbutz, perched on a hill, dominated the coastal road midway between Gaza and Majdal (today Ashkelon).\n\nEgypt had dispatched an expeditionary force of around 10,000 men under the command of Major General Ahmad Ali al-Mwawi to Palestine in April 1948. Mwawi had separated his forces into two parts, one to march towards Jerusalem, the other to advance up the coast to Tel Aviv. \nThe Egyptians had bypassed several settlements along their route of advance, but on reaching Yad Mordechai on May 16, Mwawi decided that the settlement was too large and well defended to be simply bypassed. The Egyptians had the benefit of armor, artillery and air support. They also mustered 2,500 soldiers for the assault, far outnumbering the commune's 130 defenders.\n\nAn assembly of the kibbutz members decided on the evacuation of the women and children. On the night of May 18–19, a small Israeli armored column reached the kibbutz and extracted its 92 children. Left behind were 110 members (twenty of them women) and two squads of Palmachniks, equipped with light weapons, a medium machine gun and a PIAT hand-held anti-tank weapon.\n\nThe Egyptians prepared for their assault for two days. Just after dawn on May 19, two battalions of infantry and one armored battalion attacked the village with artillery support. The Egyptians succeeded in breaching the perimeter fence, but after three hours of heavy fighting, were repulsed, leaving behind dozens of dead; the kibbutz suffered five dead and eleven wounded. Cairo radio announced prematurely that the settlement had fallen. The following day the Egyptians launched several more attacks (four according to Pollack, seven according to Morris), all of which were repulsed. Thirteen more Israelis died and twenty were wounded; dozens of Egyptians died as well. That night the Palmach sent in a platoon of reinforcements, including six deserters from the British military, with another PIAT and three machine guns. The Egyptians were hampered by the ineffectiveness of their artillery, and the difficulty in coordinating infantry and armor.\n\nAfter the attacks on May 20, the Egyptians reorganized as Mwawi improved the coordination between his forces. The Egyptians spent May 21–22 shelling the kibbutz. The Egyptian air force prevented a relief column from reaching the site. The settlement's buildings were leveled and the defenders had become \"inhabitants of caves and tunnels\". By May 22, with dozens of wounded, the defenders were pleading for permission to withdraw. The final Egyptian attack on May 23 saw the armor providing much better support for the infantry, and the Egyptians occupied a part of the settlement. At night, the Israeli defenders, exhausted from the fighting and low on ammunition, withdrew from the settlement. The Israeli withdrawal was unknown to the Egyptians and the following day, they opened up with a four-hour artillery barrage on the now empty kibbutz. Following the barrage, they occupied the settlement, ending the battle.\n\nThe Israeli delaying action at Yad Mordechai bought the newly established Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) time to organize a defensive line against the northward Egyptian drive toward Tel Aviv. On November 5, in the days following Operation Yoav, Israeli forces retook the ruins of the kibbutz.\n\n"}

It tolerates a tropical lowland climate better than its relatives \"Annona reticulata\" and \"Annona cherimola\" (whose fruits often share the same name) helping make it the most widely cultivated of these species.\n\"Annona squamosa\" is a small, semi-(or late) deciduous,\nmuch branched shrub or small tree to tall\nsimilar to soursop (\"Annona muricata\").\n\nThe fruit of \"A. squamosa\" (sugar-apple) has sweet whitish pulp, and is popular in tropical markets.\n\n\n\n\n\"Annona squamosa\" is native to the tropical Americas and West Indies, but the exact origin is unknown. It is now the most widely cultivated of all the species of \"Annona\", being grown for its fruit throughout the tropics and warmer subtropics, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan; it was introduced to southern Asia before 1590. It is naturalized as far north as southern Florida in the United States and as south as Bahia in Brazil, Bangladesh, and is an invasive species in some areas.\n\n\n\nLike most species of \"Annona\", it requires a tropical or subtropical climate with summer temperatures from to , and mean winter temperatures above . It is sensitive to cold and frost, being defoliated below and killed by temperatures of a couple of degrees below freezing. It is only moderately drought-tolerant, requiring at least 700 mm of annual rainfall, and will not produce fruit well during droughts.\n\nIt will grow from sea level to and does well in hot dry climates, differing in its tolerance of lowland tropics from many of the other fruit bearers in the \"Annona\" family.\n\nIt is quite a prolific bearer, and it will produce fruit in as little as two to three years. A five-year-old tree can produce as many as 50 sugar apples. Poor fruit production has been reported in Florida because there are few natural pollinators (honeybees have a difficult time penetrating the tightly closed female flowers); however, hand pollination with a natural fiber brush is effective in increasing yield. Natural pollinators include beetles (coleoptera) of the families Nitidulidae, Staphylinidae, Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae and Scarabeidae.\n\nIn the Philippines, the fruit is commonly eaten by the Philippine fruit bat (\"kabag\" or \"kabog\"), which then spreads the seeds from island to island.\n\nIt is a host plant for larvae of the butterfly \"Graphium agamemnon\" (tailed jay).\n\nIn traditional Indian, Thai, and American medicine, the leaves are used in a decoction to treat dysentery and urinary tract infection.<ref name=\" doi10.1016/j.hermed.2016.10.003\"></ref> In traditional Indian medicine, they are also crushed and applied to wounds. In Mexico, the leaves are rubbed on floors and put in hens' nests to repel lice.\n\nThe diterpenoid alkaloid atisine is the most abundant alkaloid in the root. Other constituents of \"Annona squamosa\" include the alkaloids oxophoebine, reticuline, isocorydine, and methylcorydaldine, and the flavonoid quercetin-3-O-glucoside.\n\nBayer AG has patented the extraction process and molecular identity of the annonaceous acetogenin annonin, as well as its use as a biopesticide. Other acetogenins have been isolated from the seeds, bark, and leaves.\n\n"}

A distinguished staff officer and an ardent Venizelist and anti-royalist, Pangalos played a leading role in the September 1922 revolt that deposed King Constantine I and in the establishment of the Second Hellenic Republic. In June 1925 Pangalos staged a bloodless coup, and his assumption of power was recognized by the National Assembly which named him Prime Minister. As a \"constitutional dictator\" he ruled the country until his overthrow in August 1926. From April 1926 until his deposition, he also occupied the office of President of the Republic.\n\nPangalos withdrew from public life for a while, but remained active in the Venizelist military circles. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, Pangalos and military officers close to him played a role in the establishment of the Security Battalions and was widely suspected of collaboration with the Germans. Cleared by a postwar court, he ran unsuccessfully for political office and died in 1952.\n\nPangalos was born on the island of Salamis on 11/23 January 1878. His mother was descendant of the local Arvanite fighter of the Greek Revolution, Giannakis Meletis (Hatzimeletis), while his paternal side came from an aristocratic family of Kea island.\n\nHe graduated from the Greek Army Academy on 16/29 July 1900 as an Infantry Second Lieutenant, and continued his studies in Paris, France.\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 he served as a staff officer in the 6th Infantry Division. He was head of the forces that entered Sidirokastro (Demir Hisar) during the second Balkan war.\n\nIn 1916 he joined Eleftherios Venizelos' Provisional Government of National Defence against King Constantine I, and was tasked with recruiting the 9th Cretan Regiment for the new government. He did not have a chance to lead it to battle though, because when King Constantine abdicated and Venizelos took over the governance of all of Greece in June 1917, he was appointed chief of the personnel department in the Ministry of Military Affairs. In early 1918 he went to the front as Chief of Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in the Strymon sector of the Macedonian front. In late 1918 he was appointed chief of staff of the General Headquarters, holding the post until the electoral victory of the pro-royalist and anti-Venizelist United Opposition in November 1920, when he was dismissed from the army.\n\nIn 1922, Pangalos supported the 11 September 1922 Revolution, led by Nikolaos Plastiras, which abolished the monarchy and declared the Second Hellenic Republic, and played a major role in the rapid establishment of the regime in Athens, while Plastiras and the army were still sailing from Chios. His first job was to prosecute a number of prominent pro-monarchist government leaders by military court in what became known as the Trial of the Six. On 14/27 November he was named Minister for Military Affairs and tasked with reorganizing the Greek army in Macedonia and Thrace, as the war with Turkey was not over, and an attack in the region was feared to be imminent. The reorganization of the \"Army of Evros\", which he commanded from mid-December, was so successful that the Greek High Command prepared for a possible advance into Eastern Thrace in the face of the Turkish demands in the Lausanne peace talks. The military threat posed by Pangalos' army helped the Turks back down, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed.\n\nA staunch nationalist, Pangalos objected to the terms of the treaty, and declared that his troops would attack Turkey nonetheless in order to block the deal. He was forced to resign, but his stance made him popular with the many segments of Greek society that objected to the treaty. During the period of political instability that followed, Pangalos jumped into the fray, gaining and losing a number of ministerial positions as governments came and went.\n\nHe assisted in the suppression of the failed Leonardopoulos–Gargalidis coup d'état attempt in October 1923, and was elected to Parliament for Thessaloniki in December. He was appointed Minister for Public Order in the cabinet of Alexandros Papanastasiou on 31 March 1924, holding the post until 18 June, when he became once more Minister for Military Affairs, retaining the post until the cabinet's resignation on 25 July 1924.\n\nOn June 24, 1925, officers loyal to Pangalos, fearing that the political instability was putting the country at risk, overthrew the government in a coup and forced President Pavlos Kountouriotis to appoint Pangalos as Prime Minister. Pangalos immediately abolished the young republic and began to prosecute anyone who could possibly challenge his authority, including his old chief, Plastiras. Freedom of the press was abolished, and a number of repressive laws were enacted (including a law dictating the length of women's skirts - no more than 30 cm above the ground), while Pangalos awarded himself the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. Pangalos declared a state of emergency on 3 January 1926 and assumed dictatorial powers. In April 1926, he had himself elected president as well in a rigged election. On the economic front Pangalos attempted to devalue the currency by ordering paper notes cut in half.\n\nHis political and diplomatic inability however became soon apparent. He conceded too many rights to Yugoslav commerce in Thessaloniki, but worst of all, he embroiled Greece in the so-called War of the Stray Dog, harming Greece's already strained international relations. Soon, many of the officers that had helped him come to power decided that he had to be removed. Regarding relations with Turkey, he still was not agreed with the treaty of Lausanne and tried to form an alliance with fascist Italy in a war against Turkey, with no success.\n\nOn 29 August 1926, a counter-coup led by General Georgios Kondylis deposed him, and Kountouriotis returned as president, while Pangalos was imprisoned for two years in the Izzeddin Fortress.\n\nIn 1930, Pangalos was sent to prison for a building scandal. He remained in prison for two years and was released during a period when a number of amnesties were given by Venizélos. He never regained the popular support he had before the coup, and never again played a role in Greek politics. After Greece fell to the Germans in 1941, Pangalos and other Venizelist officers moved to support the new collaborationist regime. He also played an important role, albeit from behind the stage, in the establishment of the Security Battalions, which he hoped to use against both the Communist-dominated National Liberation Front and against a possible return of King George II and the royal government from exile. Ambitious, tough and able, Pangalos was also widely distrusted for his rashness, megalomania and for being generally \"half mad\". Through Pangalos did not formally take a position with the Security Battalions, but he ensured his followers were given key positions in the Security Battalions. Pangalos was especially close to SS-\"Standartenführer\" Walter Blume, who was regarded as the most extreme and violent of all the SS leaders in Greece. Blume intrigued in the summer of 1944 to have Pangalos appointed prime minister of the puppet Hellenic State to replace Ioannis Rallis, who was very close to a nervous breakdown by that point. He was accused of collaboration, but was cleared of all charges in September 1945. He unsuccessfully ran for parliament in 1950 and died in Kifissia two years later.\n\nHis grandson, also named Theodoros Pangalos, served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Greece. He is a member of the PASOK socialist party.\n\nTheodoros Pangalos is mentioned in the song \"Stin epohi tou Pangalou\" (In the times of Pangalos, ) by Giorgos Mitsakis, originally sung by George Dalaras.\n\n"}

Its name roughly translated into English as \"the Consultative Council\". The lower house of parliament is the House of Representatives. The council was abolished by the 2014 constitution.\n\nThe Shura Council was created in 1980 through a Constitutional Amendment. The Council was composed of 264 members of which 176 members were directly elected and 88 were appointed by the President of the Republic for six-year terms. Membership was rotating, with one half of the Council renewed every three years.\n\nA legal challenge concerning the constitutionality of the Shura Council was to have been considered on 2 December 2012 by the High Constitutional Court, but the court postponed the verdict in response to protests. Mohamed Morsi's constitutional declaration issued in November 2012 bars the Shura Council from being dissolved by the judiciary. The constitutional declaration issued by Morsi in December 2012 allowed the Shura Council to be dissolved by the judiciary. The High Constitutional Court referred the lawsuit to the State Commissioners' Board, which is the advisory board of the High Constitutional Court, on 15 January 2013. The board of commissioners will review the lawsuit on 10 February 2013; after lawyers give the required documents, the board will create a report on the constitutionality of the election law. The report was received 22 April 2013. The formation of the Shura Council was ruled unconstitutional on 2 June 2013. As of early July 2013, 30 members of the Shura Council have resigned. The Shura Council was dissolved on 5 July 2013.\n\nThe Shura Council comprised 264 members, two-thirds (176) of whom were elected by direct ballot, and the remaining third appointed by the President of the Republic. Half of all members were required to be farmers or workers.\n\nThe term membership of the Shura Council was six years. However, renewed election and appointment of 50% of the total number of members was required every three years, and re-election and re-appointment was possible for those members whose terms were expiring. The Constitution provided many guarantees to protect the Council, including:\n\nIn accordance with the law, any candidate wishing to be elected to the Shura Council shall meet the following conditions: \n\nThe Shura Council member is elected by the absolute majority of valid votes cast in the elections.\n\nAlthough the powers of the Shura Council were not as extensive or effective as the People’s Assembly, its jurisdiction as provided by Articles (194) and (195) of the Constitutions of 1971 and 2012 covers the studying and proposing of what is deemed necessary to preserve the principles of the 23 July revolution and the 15 May 1971 Corrective Revolution.\nThe Shura Council consulted on the following (Article 195):\n\nThe council must \"ratify\":\nIn case of disagreements with the People’s Assembly, a combined committee is formed composed of both chambers’ chairmen and seven members from each chamber.

However, the formation of political parties based on religion is prohibited by the Constitution. Opposition and political pressure groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, are active in Egypt and make their views public, and they are represented at various levels in the political system.\n\nThe November 2000 parliamentary elections are generally regarded to have been more transparent and better executed than past elections. This is due to the new law put into force establishing universal judicial monitoring of polling stations. On the other hand, opposition parties continue to lodge credible complaints about electoral manipulation by the government. There are significant restrictions on the political process and freedom of expression for non-governmental organizations, including professional syndicates and organizations promoting respect for human rights.\n\nNote that, prior to the 2011–2012 elections, the Council and Assembly had both been dissolved by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.\n\nOn 19 August 2008, a huge fire seriously damaged most of the 19th-century palace that houses the Shura Council in Cairo. At least thirteen people were hurt in the fire, which destroyed the parliamentary archive room and several meeting chambers.\n\nAccording to the Egyptian Channel 1, 99% of the documents were destroyed in the fire. \n\nOn 21 November 2009, President Mubarak inaugurated the new Shura Council Building, which was renovated by Al Mokaweloon Al Arab.\n\n\n"}

They have a population of 13,271.\n\nLying within the historic boundaries of County Durham, the villages are first recorded in print in 1170. Their names evolved from the words \"Bold\" or \"Botl\", meaning a building, and \"dun\", meaning a hill.\n\nIn 1866, work began sinking a pit that began producing coal in 1869, and was then known as Boldon New Winning. The village that developed nearby in the 1870s became known as Boldon Colliery. When the mine was deepened and extended in the 1910s, further housing to accommodate the workforce was built to the south of the pit in an area known as Boldon New Town.\n\nUntil 1974 the area was administered as an urban district of County Durham, but since then has been part of the borough of South Tyneside.\n\nIn 1976, the Boldon Colliery Band appeared in episode 13 of the television series \"When the Boat Comes In\". The mine closed in 1982 but more jobs became available when an Asda supermarket opened in 1987. Recent developments include Boldon Business Park. Boldon Colliery also has its own multi-screen cinema operated by Cineworld. The main secondary school in the area is Boldon School, a specialist sports college.\n\nThe Boldons form part of the suburban fringe of South Tyneside and are completely surrounded by green belt.\n\nThere are conservation areas within the historic village centres of East and West Boldon. East Boldon is considered the more affluent sought after area of the Boldons. With a reputation competing with nearby Cleadon, East Boldon attracts a young professional family market and residents to this day have created a very much desired family, village environment. The three schools are very much sought after, they provide nursery, infants and juniors, who work together via the PTA. The village has its own community Facebook page and Friends of East Boldon Parks hold annual community events such as party in the park and Halloween trails etc. The East Boldon Scouts is one of the largest in the UK with over 200 attendees. House prices are higher than national average and sell quickly due to their desirability.\n\nDespite the relatively small geographical area, there are a significant number of older buildings considered as being of architectural merit including churches, public houses and former country houses, as well as modern additions. St. Nicholas Church in West Boldon is a Grade I listed building; much of the stonework dates from the thirteenth century, but the foundation of the building dates from the Saxon period.\n\nThe area includes a wide range of housing styles, from Edwardian villas to Victorian terraces, post-war housing to more recent smaller-scale developments. The first street built in Boldon Colliery was Cross Row (also known as Sinkers Row) which was constructed to house the men who were initially employed to sink the shaft. Several years later, other major housing projects were started and terraced housing such as that at Arnold Street and Charles Street were built.\n\nAfter the colliery was closed the former industrial land lay derelict for many years. In 2000, Colliery Wood was created with over 2,500 trees planted. The wood is popular with the local community and provides a habitat for animals such as pheasants, squirrels, woodpeckers and otters. Colliery Wood provides six new paths, which are also suitable for cycling and link to East Boldon, and Brockley Whins and Whiteleas in nearby South Shields.\n\nBoldon Flats is another site important for nature conservation, which contains an area of damp pasture. The flats are flooded from each October to March and attract a wide array of bird life and a large population of common frogs.\n\nWest Boldon Lodge, constructed by the National Grid, is situated amongst a range of habitat, including wetland, grassland and woodland. Locally rare orchids are present at one site.\n\nThe River Don traverses Boldon and is the last stronghold of water voles in South Tyneside.\n\nRecent/proposed projects include:\n\nThe new £17.5 million Boldon School opened on 6 November 2006. It has been funded by a private finance initiative and was constructed by Gleeson Building Company as well as other small businesses. The new school boasts a £750,000 theatre, top-of-the-range arts facilities, a four-lane 25 metre swimming pool and other new sports facilities such as five-a-side football pitches gymnasium. Computerised technology has been incorporated into the school's meals service, with school pupils using an electronic card system to purchase meals.\n\nThe recently built Quadrus Centre at Boldon Business Park houses entrepreneurial businesses and acts as a gateway to South Tyneside on the main A19 trunk road. The building features a modern design within its lakeside setting. The building is illuminated at night in a range of colours and has won many awards for its iconic design.\n\nBoldon has produced many notable sports personalities, one of which was former Newcastle United footballer Wes Saunders. Charlton Athletic goalkeeper Sam Bartram, their record appearance holder, who played 800 games for the London club, was signed from Boldon Villa in September 1934 and played in four successive Wembley cup finals from 1944 to 1947. Full back Jack Shreeve moved from the Villa to Charlton in 1935 and was a colleague of Bartram's in their 1947 FA Cup winning team. A Sam Bartram Memorial Cup competition was introduced at Boldon in February 2008 aimed at inspiring current footballing youngsters in the Boldon area.\nNotable sportsmen from Boldon are cricketers Simon Brown and current England rugby youth player Robert Bell, Darlington Striker Shaun Reay and Spennymoor Town Midfielder Jamie Chandler.\n\nThere are private tennis and golf clubs at Dipe Lane as well as other pursuits on offer within local schools, community centres and parks.\n\nBoldon School is now a sports college and holds host to a variety of different sports and events. It is the only school in South Tyneside with a sports college status.\n\nThe Jarrow Roofing Boldon Community Association F.C. was founded in 1987 and plays at The Boldon C.A. Sports Ground.\n\nEast Boldon and Cleadon was previously the only ward in South Tyneside to elect three Conservative councillors. However, in the 2011 Local Elections Labour candidate Joan Atkinson unseated the sitting Conservative councillor, reducing the number of Conservatives on South Tyneside Council to one. Boldon Colliery usually elects three Labour councillors.\n\nThe Boldons are within the Jarrow constituency, which also includes Jarrow, Hebburn and parts of east Gateshead. The local MP is Stephen Hepburn of the Labour Party.\n\nIn the earlier part of the 20th century, a famous son of the community was the Labour politician Jack Lawson.\n\n\n"}

It is located east of the CBD, and borders Belmont, Cannon Hill, Hemmant, and Manly West.\n\nThe suburb has some older style homes built in the post war period – weatherboard and chamferboard post war cottages in particular. Most of the new estates are made up of typically low set and high set brick and tile homes. Previously the land that is now being developed into residential zones was devoted to small farmlets and semi-industrial developments.\n\nThe recent developments, which occurred in the last five years, are increasing the population and the median house prices of the suburb.\n\nAlso nearby is the Murarrie railway station that runs west to the City and east to Manly and the bay. There are also several bus routes from Tingalpa to neighbouring suburbs.\n\nThe origin of Tingalpa's name is uncertain. It may be named after Tingalpa Creek, which lies east, or be derived from the Turrubal words \"tangul\" (meaning 'plant for stupefying fish') and \"pa\" (meaning 'place').\n\nTingalpa Creek was surveyed in 1841 and named Tingulpa, probably derived from an Aboriginal expression referring to a fat kangaroo.\n\nIn 1863, a township site was surveyed on the west side of Tingalpa Creek, where Old Cleveland Road crossed the creek. It was never built on and was known as Old Tingalpa. In 1943, this location was formally abolished. In 1860s a new site was settled called New Tingalpa, away to the north-west.\n\nIn 1867, a post office was opened. In the same year a local architect, Richard Suter designed the Gothic Anglican Christ Church, which was built in 1868. The church and burial ground located on Wynnum Road, east of Bulimba Creek. Both the church and its burial ground are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\n\nThe Royal Mail Hotel was licensed in 1870. This hotel is now named the Tingalpa Hotel.\n\nThe Tingalpa primary school was opened in 1873.\n\nTingalpa Cemetery had its first burial in 1875. In 1913 it was renamed Hemmant Cemetery. Lawn cemeteries were added from 1952. In 2001 a crematorium opened at the cemetery. Despite the name change, as at 2020, it is within the boundaries of Tingalpa and not Hemmant ().\n\nIn 1880, a local government division was established for the Tingalpa area. The boundaries of this area were \"south-east from the intersection of the Pacific Highway and the Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road, crossing the Tingalpa Creek and ending at Redland Bay.\" The headquarters of the local government were located at Mount Cotton.\n\nThe Wynnum and Manly Road are where the above facilities are roughly located. In 1919, the diggers's war memorial was erected, making this location more prominent. In 1925, the west part of the Shire of Tingalpa become part of the Greater City of Brisbane. In 1949 the rest of the shire was joined with the Shire of Cleveland, becoming Shire of Redland (now City of Redland). In the 1949 Queensland Post Office Directory there were eight poultry farms and there are fewer dairymen. There was also two motor garages and the Pacific Cafe on Wynnum Road. In 1998, Christ Church, Tingalpa and its burial ground were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\n\nBy 1980 the population of Tingalpa had nearly tripled from 1400 people in 1954.\nThe recorded 8,539 residents in Tingalpa, of whom 50.5% were female and 49.5% were male. The median age of the population was 35; 2 years younger than the Australian average. 72.1% of people living in Tingalpa were born in Australia, with the next most common countries of birth being New Zealand (6.9%), England (3.8%), the Philippines (1.4%), Fiji (0.9%), and India (0.8%). 84.5% of people spoke English as their first language, while the other most common responses were Hindi (1%), Greek (0.9%), Tagalog (0.7%), Cantonese (0.7%), and Spanish (0.6%).\n\nTingalpa has one primary school, Tingalpa State School, a government co-educational primary (P-6) school. In 2015, the school had an enrolment of 328 children with 26 teachers (22 full-time equivalent).\n\nOn the first of August 1870 the Board of Education received a letter from Mr. W. Wood, a local farmer in the Tingalpa shire about the necessity of having a school for the district. Funds were raised by the community to buy the original 2 acres and also to build a temporary school located at 1546 Wynnum Road.\n\nOn the 1 August 1873, the Tingalpa school was opened. Mr. Bernard McGouran was the first Head teacher. The school started with 50 pupils on the roll, by June 1874 there were 99 students. The primary reason for enrolling in the early years was to learn to speak English, as the most commonly use language was the local Aboriginal dialect.\n\nTingalpa features a large amount of parks and bushland. Well known Meadowlands Park and Minnippi Park are located less than four minutes drive from Tingalpa. Bulimba Creek passes through these parks on its way to the Brisbane River. Moreton Bay Sports Club is also located at Carmichael Park next to the creek. The venue hosts cricket and Brisbane Premier League matches with 2001 and 2010 grand final winners, and 2011 League Champions Wolves FC. Kianawah Park is the oldest park in the suburb and has extensive facilities.\n\nTingalpa has bike paths going through their parks and these are part of the extensive bike paths that are throughout Brisbane.\n\nTingalpa has two small local shopping centres: Twin Parks Shopping Centre located on Wynnum Road, Tingalpa - and one located on Belmont Road, Belmont. There are two large shopping centres within a 10-minute drive; Wynnum Plaza has Kmart, Coles, Woolworths, Dan Murphys, Fitness First and 59 Specialty stores whilst Carindale Shopping Centre features Myer, David Jones and a large selection of specialty shops.\nBoth the Twin Parks and the Cannon Hill shopping centres are only basic centres.\n\nIn 2011, one of the first Masters Home Improvement retail outlets in Queensland opened in Tingalpa and was located at the intersection of Wynnym Road and New Cleveland Road up until its closure in December 2016.\n\n"}

It is also one of the least known works of Shigeru Miyamoto. The game was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in all major regions throughout 2012.\n\nIn the game, Muddy has to move a black ball to a gate at the end of the screen in order to get to the next screen. He can push, pull, and throw the black ball. Muddy can also dig into soft ground to find underground paths around obstacles. Choosing where to dig is a crucial element of the game's various puzzles, as creating holes in the wrong areas could hinder the player's efforts to advance. Dropping the ball into a hole would cause it to return to its starting point. Given the nature of Muddy's ability to move the ball, digging holes in the wrong places could make reaching the gate with the ball completely impossible, requiring Muddy to leave the screen and then return to try again. Along the way, there are many obstacles, such as moving enemies, pipes, barrels, weights, and bosses.\n\nPlayers play as a mole named Muddy Mole (known in Japan as , whose wife and children have been kidnapped by the farmer, Jinbe. Muddy must find and rescue his wife and seven children by navigating his way through the seven worlds of Jinbe Land; avoiding enemies, solving puzzles, stealing cabbages, and defeating the boss of each world. Freeing his loved ones one by one before coming face-to-face with Jinbe himself.\n\nJinbe, a cabbage farmer and ruler of Jinbe Land, serves as the main antagonist to Muddy. He is depicted with a Mario-esque appearance and stature, wearing red overalls and a green shirt. His face is obscured by a full beard and he is seen wearing a brimmed gardener's hat.\n\nJinbe Land is home to a wide variety of enemies sent by Jinbe to intercept Muddy before rescuing his family. These enemies include Yoshi-like dinosaurs as well as two unnamed \"plumber sons\" that Muddy must defeat later in the game. It is unknown if Mole Mania is canonically in the same universe as Mario. It has been speculated that Jinbe and Mario are related in some way.\n\nJason Cipriano of MTV praised the games' short and to-the-point puzzles. \"1UP.com\" had compared the game to \"Adventures of Lolo\" when it comes to gameplay.\n\n"}

It consists of Interstates, U.S. highways, state highways, and secondary roads, totaling approximately .\n\nSouth Carolina Highways has had three major highway marker changes over its existence. The first signs used by the state featured an all white square with a black outline of the geographic state of South Carolina with black numbers located in the center. In 1948, a more simple design was established; still using a white square with just the numbers and the initials \"S.C.\" at the top; a variant wider side was used for three-digit numbers. In the 1960s-1970s, an alternate was also used, which was a white square with \"S. CAROLINA\" partitioned at the top and number below.\n\nOn June 19, 2007, the South Carolina Department of Transportation Commission approved the change to the signs marking the primary state highways from the black-and-white to the blue-and-white design, which features an outline of the state, the palmetto tree and crescent symbol from the state flag, and the words \"SOUTH CAROLINA\" spelled out along on the top of the highway shield. South Carolina uses a wide shield for all routes, regardless of number of digits.\n\nSouth Carolina utilizes a numbering system to keep track of all non-interstate and primary highways that are maintained by SCDOT. First appearing in 1947 (when a huge amount of highways were cancelled or truncated), the \"state highway secondary system\" carries the number of the county followed by a unique number for the particular road. An example is S-11-154, which defines a secondary road in Cherokee County (11) with a road number of 154 (Whelchel Road). The counties are numbered in alphabetical order, with Abbeville as 1 and York as 46. Secondary road signs may either be integrated with a street name sign or appear separate as a black rectangle with white lettering.\n\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division a.k.a.

It is a dioecious, perennial, herbaceous climbing plant which sends up new shoots in early spring and dies back to a cold-hardy rhizome in autumn.\n\nHops are described as bine plants rather than vine because, unlike vines, they have stiff downward facing hairs that provide stability and allow them to climb. These shoots allow \"H. lupulus\" to grow anywhere from . Hops have fragrant, wind-pollinated flowers that attract butterflies.\n\nThe female cone shaped fruits from \"H. lupulus\" are used by breweries to preserve and flavor beer, and so \"H. lupulus\" is widely cultivated for use by the brewing industry. The fragrant flower cones, known as hops, impart a bitter flavor, and also have aromatic and preservative qualities. \"H. lupulus\" contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins, and resin.\n\nThe genus name \"Humulus\" is a Medieval name that was at some point Latinized after being borrowed from a Germanic source exhibiting the h•m•l consonant cluster, as in Middle Low German \"homele\". According to Soviet Iranist V. Abaev this could be a word of Sarmatian origin which is presented in modern Ossetian language () and derives from proto-Iranian \"hauma-arayka\", an \"Aryan haoma\". From Sarmatian dialects this word spread across Eurasia, thus creating a group of related words in Turkic, Finno-Ugric, Slavic and Germanic languages (see , Chuvash \"хăмла\", Finnish \"humala\", Hungarian \"komló\", Mordovian \"комла\", Avar \"хомеллег\").\n\nThe specific epithet, \"lupulus,\" is Latin for small wolf. The name refers to the plant's tendency to strangle other plants, mainly osiers or basket willows (\"Salix viminalis\"), like a wolf does a sheep. Hops could be seen growing over these willows so often that it was named the willow-wolf.\n\nThe English word \"hop\" is derived from the Middle Dutch word , also meaning \"Humulus lupulus\".\n\n\"H. lupulus\" can grow to be 10 meters tall and because it is a perennial herbaceous plant it goes through several growing seasons sometimes living up to 20 years. \"H. lupulus\" has simple leaves that can be opposite or alternate with 3-5 lobes. The staminate flowers do not have petals, while the pistillate flowers’ petals completely cover the fruit. The cones found on female plants are called strobili. The fruit of \"H. lupulus\" is an achene, meaning that the fruit is dry but does not split open at maturity. The achene is surrounded by tepals and lupulin secreting glands are concentrated on the fruit.\n\n\"H. lupulus\" grows best in the latitude range of 38°-51° in full sun with moderate amounts of rainfall. It uses the longer summer days as a cue for when to flower, which is usually around July/ August.\n\n\"H. lupulus\" can cause dermatitis to some who handle them. It is thought that about 1 in 30 people are affected by this.\n\nThe five varieties of this species (\"Humulus lupulus\") are:\n\nMany cultivated varieties are found in the list of hop varieties. A yellow-leafed ornamental cultivar, \"Humulus lupulus\" 'Aureus', is cultivated for garden use. It is also known as golden hop, and holds the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (AGM).\n\n\"H. lupulus\" is first mentioned in 768 CE when King Pepin donated hops to a monastery in Paris. Cultivation was first recorded in 859 CE, in documents from a monastery in Freising, Germany.\n\nThe chemical compounds found in \"H. lupulus\" are main components in flavoring and bittering beer. Some other compounds help with creating foam in beer. Chemicals such as linalool and aldehydes contribute to the flavor of beer. The main components of bitterness in beer are iso-alpha acids, with many other compounds contributing to the overall bitterness of beer. Until the Middle Ages, \"Myrica gale\" was the most common plant used for brewing beer. \"H. lupulus\" took off as a flavoring agent for beer because it contains preserving agents, making the beer viable for longer.\n\n\n\n\"H. lupulus\" was voted the county flower of Kent in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.\n\n\n"}

Barnes (born May 30, 1974) is the singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter for the indie rock group of Montreal, part of the Elephant 6 Collective. Barnes started the band on his own and, although providing several stories as to the origin of the name, is said to have named it after a failed romance with a woman of Montreal, Quebec. The group has recorded fifteen full-length albums, and numerous EPs and 7\" singles. His brother, David Barnes, is an artist and has designed most of the band's artwork for albums since the release of \"The Gay Parade\".\n\nIn 2003, Barnes married Nina Aimee Grøttland, a graphic artist and former Ethnobabes member. They separated in December 2013. They have one daughter, Alabee, born in Oslo on December 29, 2004.\n\nof Montreal consists of various musicians, with Barnes being the only continuous member. The group has recorded sixteen studio albums, beginning with \"Cherry Peel\", and, most recently, \"UR FUN\", which was released on January 17, 2020 on Polyvinyl. While melodic pop has always been Barnes' primary vehicle, his style has managed to transform significantly since the 1997 release of Cherry Peel. The acoustic tendencies of early albums gradually transformed into a more electronic, funk, and overall eclectic sound. One of the features which often appears in Barnes' songwriting is his penchant for composing upbeat melodies to gloomy lyrics and morose subject matter. At different periods in the band's career he has dealt with subjects both personal and fictional. He is a prolific lyricist with a tendency to employ unusual words and phrases and complicated wordplay.\n\nKevin Barnes' writing has encompassed many styles over the years. Of Montreal's first album \"Cherry Peel\" dealt mainly with personal issues of unrequited love, as in the songs \"Baby\" or \"Montreal\", or humorous mundane situations, as in \"Tim I Wish You Were Born a Girl\". His style then shifted to story-telling, often involving dialogues, as in \"Good Morning Mr. Edminton\" from the album \"\", or fictional characters, such as Rose Robert or Jacques Lamure, or even fictional mythological creature, like the Efeblum.\n\nThe albums \"The Gay Parade\", \"\" and the referred \"Coquelicot\" are constructed as concept albums.\n\nBy 2004, though, Barnes was starting to revert to more personal lyrics, even incorporating the names of the people close to him and using them as characters in his own songs:\n\n\nKevin Barnes has fluctuated between writing personal and fictional lyrics over the course of his career, in part because negative reviews his first album received deterred him from writing about himself for a period of time. He explained:\"I think if you only write about yourself and your personal life it feels maybe a bit narcissistic, but I think it’s inevitable that there will always be some aspect of your personal life or your personal emotions coming through, even if you write about something that would seem like fiction.\"His lyrics, though mostly concerned with dark themes, often portray a certain fondness for:\n\nDespite common assumption, Barnes does not use recreational drugs or psychedelics to aid in his writing, composing, or recording.\n\nWith of Montreal, Barnes has always tried to cross the bridge between his love of theater, comedy, and music, often resulting in interludes between songs—skits, slow-motion sword fights and surreal interaction between band members. However, since the release of Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?, Barnes has been performing as his on-stage glam rock alter ego, Georgie Fruit, first mentioned in \"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal.\" Kevin has said that the album shows his transformation to Georgie Fruit, as is evident in the variation in musical style from in album leading up to \"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal\" and the two songs after. He has described Georgie Fruit as a black man in his forties who has undergone multiple sex changes. Georgie, Kevin told Pitchfork Media, was in a funk-rock band called Arousal back in the seventies.\n\nBarnes has performed in unusual circumstances such as on a white horse and while completely nude.\n\n"}
{"id": "1912309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912309", "title": "Modern Woodmen Park", "text": "Modern Woodmen Park\n\nModern Woodmen Park (known previously as John O'Donnell Stadium and Municipal Stadium) is a minor league baseball venue located in Davenport, Iowa, United States. It is home to the Quad Cities River Bandits, a Class-A affiliate of the Houston Astros. Since 1987, St. Ambrose University plays all of its home baseball games there as well. Located on the banks of the Mississippi River, in the shadow of the Centennial Bridge, home run balls to right field often land in the river.\n\nAs night games became more necessary, Davenport teams were playing at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, without lights. The city of Davenport realized a lighted stadium, downtown, on the riverfront, would be ideal. Proposed by the Davenport Levee Commission, Municipal Stadium opened May 26, 1931, within LeClaire Park. The ballpark was built at a cost of $185,000. The first night game was June 4, 1931.\n\nExpansions in the 1940s and in 1962 brought capacity up to 6,200 and 8,500 respectively. It is one of the oldest ballparks still in use in all of the minor leagues, although it underwent a major renovation before the 1989 season, lowering the seating capacity to 5,200 and before the 2004 season that brought the ballpark up to modern professional baseball standards and a seating capacity of 4,024.\n\nOn May 27, 1971, the stadium was renamed John O'Donnell Stadium in honor of the longtime sports editor of the Davenport \"Times-Democrat\", shortly following his death. John O'Donnell Stadium was renamed Modern Woodmen Park on December 12, 2007, after Rock Island-based Modern Woodmen of America purchased the naming rights to the facility. O'Donnell's name remains on the ballpark's press box.\n\nFor many years, Modern Woodmen Park played host to football games in the fall. Both Assumption High School (a private Catholic high school in Davenport) and Saint Ambrose College called the field home until 1987, when both schools began playing at Brady Street Stadium in 1988. The football bleachers and press box along left field were removed in 1989.\n\nRenovations done before the 2004 season included a nine-foot-high berm that provided a lawn seating area for fans. The berm also acted as a flood wall around the entire stadium. Until that point, the facility had no protection from Mississippi River flooding, which caused the team to play home games at other parks during river floods. During the Great Flood of 1993, photos of water creeping across the playing field at the ballpark made national publications and became somewhat of a symbol of the flood. In spring 2019, the surrounding area was flooded but the ballpark remained above water.\n\nAfter the 2007 season, new owners Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt of Main Street Baseball reinvigorated both the ballpark and the franchise. They sold naming rights to Modern Woodmen in a record 20-year deal, changed the name of the franchise back to \"River Bandits\", and made numerous improvements to the ballpark. In 2008, the club added a hot tub deck in right field, as well as a \"tiki village\", featuring three tiki bars, a covered tiki lounge, and a king-sized tiki bed beyond the right field wall. They also excavated a gravel area along the left-field foul line and planted field corn; by mid-season the corn grows high enough so that the home-team players are introduced at the beginning of the game and come running out of the corn field, just like in the movie \"Field of Dreams\".\nFor 2009, Main Street Baseball continued to make improvements, adding a new , HD ribbon board along the right field fence and installing four new concourse-level \"loge boxes\" to accommodate small groups of people. Prior to the 2010 season, the City of Davenport and Main Street Baseball replaced the entire field, to facilitate proper drainage and minimize rain-outs. Other changes for 2010 included a new concession stand on the Picnic Plaza level and a new group terrace next to the Tiki Village beyond the right-center field fence.\nIn 2014, the facility received another addition, as a Ferris wheel was constructed just beyond the left field wall. In 2017, the park added a double-decker carousel purchased from Pier 39 in San Francisco.\n\nFor both the 2008 and 2009 seasons, Modern Woodmen Park won the \"Best Ballpark Improvement\" Award from Ballparkdigest.com, the industry's leading publication.\n\nIn 2013, the park was voted as the top minor-league ballpark in the United States in a \"USA Today\" and 10best.com reader poll. Modern Woodmen Park beat second place Louisville Slugger Field by around 2,000 votes.\n\nIn 2018, Modern Woodmen Park finished third in the \"Best View in the Minors\" competition, finishing behind El Paso's Southwest University Park and Altoona's Peoples Natural Gas Field.\n\nThe River Bandits (then known as the Swing of the Quad Cities) defeated the Burlington Bees, 1–0, in the first game at the renovated Modern Woodmen Park on April 29, 2004.\n\nThe 2006 and 2011 Midwest League All-Star Games were held at Modern Woodmen Park. Previously, the ballpark hosted Midwest League All-Star Games in 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 1982 and 1990, giving the facility a total of eight.\n\nIn summer 2007, portions of the film \"Sugar\" were shot at the park. This included 800–1,000 people a night showing up to be extras.

{"id": "1912337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912337", "title": "Íslendingabók", "text": "Íslendingabók\n\nÍslendingabók (, [ˈiːslɛndɪŋgaˌboːk], \"Book of Icelanders\"; ) is a historical work dealing with early Icelandic history. The author was an Icelandic priest, Ari Þorgilsson, working in the early 12th century. The work originally existed in two different versions but only the younger one has survived. The older contained information on Norwegian kings, made use of by later writers of kings' sagas.\n\nThe priest Jón Erlendsson in Villingaholt (died 1672) in the service of bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson made two copies of Íslendingabók (now AM 113 a fol and AM 113 b fol at the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies), the latter one because the bishop was unhappy with the first version. The original copied from is assumed to have dated to ca. 1200. It was lost in the course of the late 17th century, and when Árni Magnússon looked for it, it had disappeared without a trace.\n\nÍslendingabók is a concise work which relates the major events of Icelandic history in terse prose. While the author is forced to rely almost exclusively on oral history he takes pains to establish the reliability of his sources and mentions several of them by name. He avoids supernatural material and Christian bias. The prologue of the book explicitly states that whatever might be wrong in the account must be corrected to \"that which can be proven to be most true\". Due to these qualities of the work and the early time of its writing, historians consider it the most reliable extant source on early Icelandic history.\n\nApart from a prologue and a genealogy at the end, Íslendingabók is split into ten short chapters.(only 7 listed)\n\nIceland is settled in the days of Harald I of Norway by immigrants from Norway. The first settler, Ingólfur Arnarson, arrives in Reykjavík. When the first settlers arrive Iceland is said to be forested \"from the coast to the mountains\".\n\nWhen Iceland had largely been settled a man named \"Úlfljótr\" becomes the first man to bring laws there from Norway. Another man, \"Grímr Goatshoe\" (or possibly \"Goatbeard\"), investigates all of Iceland before Alþingi can be established. Ari's text is somewhat unclear here. Presumably Grímr explored the country to find a good meeting place.\n\nThe Alþingi is established on Þingvellir, which becomes public property - it was confiscated from a man who had killed a slave. After 60 years the settlement of Iceland is complete. Ulfljótr becomes the first Lawspeaker.\n\nThe wisest men of Iceland notice that the calendar is slowly moving out of sync with the seasons. The problem lies in the fact that the calendar in use had 52 weeks to the year, only 364 days. As people come to the conclusion that something like a day is missing they are still reluctant to use a year which doesn't contain a whole number of weeks. A man named \"Þorsteinn surtr\" comes up with an ingenious solution - a whole week should be added once every seven years. The proposal is enacted into law by the assembly around 955.\n\nThe system of ad hoc local judicial assemblies becomes unwieldy and a need is felt for standardization. A man named \"Þórðr gellir\" describes to Alþingi his recent difficulties in prosecuting a certain case in a local assembly. He suggests that the country should be split into judicial quadrants, each of which should contain three assemblies. Each quadrant, then, should contain a special assembly for appeals. The motion passes with the amendment that the northern quadrant should have four assemblies, since the northerners couldn't agree on any three.\n\nGreenland is discovered and settled from Iceland around 985. Erik the Red gave the country its pleasant name to encourage people to move there. The Norse settlers find remnants of previous human habitation and deduce that the people who lived there were related to the \"skrælingjar\" of Vínland.\n\nKing Olaf I of Norway sends the missionary priest Þangbrandr to Iceland to convert the inhabitants to Christianity. He has some success in baptizing chieftains but also meets opposition and ends up killing two or three men who had composed libellous poetry about him. He returns to Norway after one or two years with a litany of complaints and tells the king that he has little hope that the country can be converted. The king is furious at hearing the news and threatens to hurt or kill Icelanders in Norway. Two of the Icelandic chieftains previously converted by Þangbrandr meet with the king and pledge their aid in converting the country.\n\nIn the summer of 999 or 1000 the issue of religion reaches a crisis point at the Alþingi. The Christian faction and the pagan faction do not want to share the same laws and the Christians choose a new lawspeaker for themselves, \"Hallr á Síðu\". He reaches an agreement with Þorgeirr Ljósvetningagoði, the pagan lawspeaker, that Þorgeirr will find a compromise acceptable to everyone.\n\nÞorgeirr goes to his camp and stays under a skin for the remainder of the day and the following night. The day after he gives a speech at Lögberg. He says that the only way to maintain peace in the country is for everyone to keep to the same laws and the same religion.\n\nBefore reciting the compromise he has come up with Þorgeirr gets his audience to pledge themselves to a solution with one set of laws for all the country. Þorgeirr then decrees that everyone not already baptized must convert to Christianity. Three concessions are made to the pagans.\n\n\nSome years later those concessions are abolished.\n\nThe genealogy at the end of the book was a langfedgatal.\n\nA website named \"islendingabok.is\" contains a full genealogy of 720,000 Icelanders starting with the information contained in Íslendingabók. The genealogy was started by an Icelandic programmer, Fridrik Skúlason using a DOS program called Espólín in 1988. In 1997 Kári Stefánsson and his company deCODE genetics created a website with Skúlason which has been expanded using genetic analysis to cover 95% of the Icelanders who have lived in the last three centuries. It has given rise to a popular app which young Icelanders use to check whether they are related.\n\n"}

Founded in 1886 as the State Normal School for Colored Persons, and becoming a land grant college in 1890, KSU was the second state-supported institution of higher learning in Kentucky. In fall 2016, there was a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,568 and a total graduate enrollment of 168.\n\nKentucky State University was chartered in May 1886 as the State Normal School for Colored Persons, only the second state-supported institution of higher learning in Kentucky. During the euphoria of Frankfort's 1886 centennial celebration, the city donated $1,500 towards the purchase of land for a new college on a bluff overlooking Frankfort.\n\nThe new school formally opened on October 11, 1887, with three teachers, 55 students, and John H. Jackson as president. Recitation Hall (now Jackson Hall), the college's first permanent building, was erected in that year.\n\nKSU became a land-grant college in 1890, and the departments of home economics, agriculture and mechanics were added to the school's curriculum. The school produced its first graduating class of five students in the spring of that year. A high school was organized in 1893. This expansion continued into the 20th century in both name and program. In 1902, the name was changed to Kentucky Normal and Industrial Institute for Colored Persons. The name was changed again in 1926 to Kentucky State Industrial College for Colored Persons.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the high school was discontinued, and in 1938 the school was named the Kentucky State College for Negroes. The term \"for Negroes\" was dropped in 1952. Kentucky State College became a university in 1972, and in 1973 the first graduate students enrolled in its School of Public Affairs.\n\nStudents are divided into five colleges, four associate degrees, 55 undergraduate degrees and six post-graduate programs.\n\n\nThe university also offers five liberal study degrees through the Whitney Young School (WYS) of Honors and Liberal Studies, which consists of a Honors Program, an Integrative Studies Program and an International Studies Program. The degrees include Africana Studies and Liberal Studies.\n\nThe Paul G. Blazer Library, constructed in 1960, houses a collection of more than 700,000 items includes extensive reference, periodical and circulating collections of materials such as books, videos, microforms, sound recordings and others, to aid students in their course work and research. It is named after Paul G. Blazer, a strong supporter of education who was the founder and CEO of Ashland Oil and Refining Company in Ashland, Kentucky.\n\n, Kentucky State University was host to 2,025 undergraduate students and 134 graduate students. African Americans comprised 49% of the undergraduate and 45% of the graduate student body.\n\nKYSU has the world's largest pawpaw (Asimina triloba) research planting. The research program was started in 1990 with the aim of developing pawpaw as a new tree-fruit crop for Kentucky. Pawpaw is the largest native fruit in the United States and has very few diseases compared to other orchard crops. KYSU is the site of the USDA National Clonal Germplasm Repository for asimina species and the pawpaw orchards at KYSU contain over 1,700 trees. Research activities include germplasm collection and variety trials, and efforts are directed towards improving propagation, understanding fruit ripening and storage, and developing orchard management practices. Cultivation is best in hardiness zones 5-9 and trees take 7–8 years from seedling to fruiting. KYSU has created the three cultivars KSU-Atwood, KSU-Benson and KSU-Chappell, with focus on better flavors, higher yields, vigorous plants, and low seed-to-pulp ratios.\n\nKentucky State University teams participate as a member of the Division II Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. The school's mascot are the Thorobreds. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, and indoor and outdoor track and field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, softball and volleyball.\n\nThe Exum Center, the university's athletic and recreational complex, was named after William Exum, the first African-American varsity football player at the University of Wisconsin. Exum was hired as head of KSU's Physical Education department in 1949, and later made head of the Athletics department. He then became manager of the United States Track and Field teams at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. Exum retired from KSU in 1980.\n\n\n"}

The classification of these state highways fall under three primary categories: Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and Vermont routes. Routes in Vermont are abbreviated as \"VT #\" by VTrans and also abbreviated as \"VT Route #\" and \"Route #\" in common usage. A small number of minor state highways, typically bypassing old alignments or short connector routes, are instead assigned names and unsigned four-digit numbers beginning with 9. Most state highways are maintained by VTrans; however, portions of some routes and some entire routes are maintained by local governments, such as towns or cities, instead. These town-maintained routes are internally called \"state-designated town highways\" and are typically designated as \"class 1 town highways\". Many of Vermont's state-numbered highways retain their numbers from when they were part of the New England road marking system of the 1920s; for instance, VT 9 was part of Route 9 of the New England system.\n\nPrior to 1995, Vermont used the standard circular highway shield to sign all of its routes, which had black numerals on a white circle over a black background. In 1995, Vermont introduced a new shield for state-maintained highways—a green shield with the word \"Vermont\" at the top. The circular highway shield continues to be used for locally maintained routes. Some state-maintained routes are still signed with the circular highway shield, but they are being converted to the newer Vermont shield as signs are replaced. Recent guide sign replacement projects along Vermont's Interstate Highways include the newer green shields to indicate Vermont state routes, as the older guide signs used the circular shield.\n\nAccording to Vermont's 2012 Fact Book the state spent $547 million in 2011. Less than half ($206 million) on preservation and maintenance. 28% of the roads remain in \"very poor\" condition. The book estimates $100 million would be required to reduce that to 25%. The VTrans report to the legislature in 2012 appeared to disagree, stating that the goal of 25% in poor condition had been met. The Burlington Free Press conducted a survey on 11% of the roads and found that signage was inadequate, often not warning drivers of dangerous curves; striping was inadequate, having been scraped off by winter snowplowing. Therefore, sides of the road could not be seen at night. Speed limit signs were placed near villages but nowhere else; guardrails were unpredictably placed. A spokesperson for VTrans agreed, citing fiscal restraints. Troopers investigating accidents are not required to record road conditions which may have contributed to an accident.\n\nAll routes in Vermont are designated by the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans). Most are also owned and maintained by VTrans, but some are partially or wholly owned and maintained by the towns it passes through instead. Routes maintained by VTrans are classified by the agency as \"state-maintained highways\" and signed using Vermont's green route shields. Routes maintained by the town are classified as \"town-maintained routes\" and signed using the national circular highway shield.\n\nFive routes in the system have both state- and town-maintained sections. Although maintenance along these routes varies by area, VTrans considers state and town-maintained highways that bear the same signed number as one continuous route.\n\nDesignations shaded in gray are no longer active.\n\nThese roads are maintained by the state but are not assigned signed route numbers. The majority of them are minor connectors between two signed routes, making them similar to New York's reference routes. Unless a town is indicated in the southern or western terminus column, each highway is entirely within the town listed in the northern or eastern Terminus column.\n\n\nhttp://www.vpr.net/news_detail/90914/\n"}

{"id": "1912360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912360", "title": "Face (sociological concept)", "text": "Face (sociological concept)\n\nFace is a class of behaviors and customs operating (active) in different countries and cultures, associated with the morality, honor, and authority of an individual (or group of individuals), and its image in social groups.\n\nAlthough Chinese writer Lin Yutang claimed \"Face cannot be translated or defined\", compare these definitions:\n\n\nFace refers to a sociological concept in general linked to the dignity and prestige that a person has in terms of their social relationships. This idea with different nuances is observed in many societies and cultures such as Chinese, Arabic, Indonesian, Korean, Malaysian, Laotian, Indian, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Thai. Face has more meanings within the context of Chinese culture.\n\nIn China, in particular, the concepts of \"mianzi\", \"lian\", and \"yan\" play an extremely important role in the fabric of society.\n\nIn Chinese culture, \"face\" refers to two distinct concepts, although linked in Chinese social relations. One is \"mianzi\" (), and the other is \"lian\" (), which are used regularly in everyday language although not so much in the formal writings.\n\nTwo influential Chinese authors explained \"face\". The Chinese writer Lu Xun referred to the American missionary Arthur Henderson Smith's (1894:16–18) interpretation.\nThe term \"face\" keeps cropping up in our conversation, and it seems such a simple expression that I doubt whether many people give it much thought. Recently, however, we have heard this word on the lips of foreigners too, who seem to be studying it. They find it extremely hard to understand, but believe that \"face\" is the key to the Chinese spirit and that grasping it will be like grabbing a queue twenty-four years ago [when wearing a queue was compulsory] – everything else will follow. (1934, 1959:129) \nLin Yutang considered the psychology of \"face\".\nInteresting as the Chinese physiological face is, the psychological face makes a still more fascinating study. It is not a face that can be washed or shaved, but a face that can be \"granted\" and \"lost\" and \"fought for\" and \"presented as a gift\". Here we arrive at the most curious point of Chinese social psychology. Abstract and intangible, it is yet the most delicate standard by which Chinese social intercourse is regulated. \n\nMiàn 面 \"face; personal esteem; countenance; surface; side\" occurs in words like:\n\n\nHsien-chin Hu says,\ncan be borrowed, struggled for, added to, padded, — all terms indicating a gradual increase in volume. It is built up through initial high position, wealth, power, ability, through cleverly establishing social ties to a number of prominent people, as well as through avoidance of acts that would cause unfavorable comment. (1944:61) \n\nLiǎn 臉 \"face; countenance; respect; reputation; prestige\" is seen in several \"face\" words:\n\n\nHu (1944:51–52) contrasts \"méiyǒu liǎn\" 沒有臉 (\"without face\") \"audacious; wanton; shameless\" as \"the most severe condemnation that can be made of a person\" and \"bùyào liǎn\" 不要臉 (\"don't want face\") \"shameless; selfishly inconsiderate\" as \"a serious accusation meaning that ego does not care what society thinks of his character, that he is ready to obtain benefits for himself in defiance of moral standards\".\n\nYán 顏 \"face; prestige; reputation; honor\" occurs in the common expression \"diū yán\" 丟顏 and the words:\n\n\nThe English semantic field for \"face\" words meaning \"prestige; honor\" is smaller than the corresponding Chinese field. English face meaning \"prestige; honor, respect, dignity, status, reputation, social acceptance, or good name. The lose verb in lose face means \"fail to maintain\", while the save in save face means \"avoid loss/damage\".\nThe country begins to feel that Government consented to arrangements by which China has lost face; the officials have long been conscious that they are becoming ridiculous in the eyes of the people, seeing that where a foreigner is concerned they can neither enforce a Chinese right, nor redress a Chinese grievance, even on Chinese soil. (1901:225)\n\"Loss of face\" occurs in \"The Times\" (August 3, 1929): \"Each wishes to concede only what can be conceded without loss of 'face.\"\n\n\"\" was coined from \"lose face\" applying the semantic opposition between \"\" and \"\" [tr. Chinese \"保面子／bǎo miànzi／guard/save face\"; when successful, it's called \"保住面子／bǎozhu miànzi / saved/guarded face\"].\n\n\"OED\" defines Save 8 \"To keep, protect or guard (a thing) from damage, loss, or destruction\", and elaborates,\n8f. to save one's face: to avoid being disgraced or humiliated. Similarly, to save (another's) face. Hence save-face adj. = \"face-saving\" ... Originally used by the English community in China, with reference to the continual devices among the Chinese to avoid incurring or inflicting disgrace. The exact phrase appears not to occur in Chinese, but ‘to lose face’ (\"diu lien\"), and ‘for the sake of his face’, are common. Among the English words of Chinese origin, \"lose face\" is an uncommon verb phrase and a unique semantic loan translation. Most Anglo-Chinese borrowings are nouns (Yuan 1981:250), with a few exceptions such as \"to kowtow\", \"to Shanghai\", \"to brainwash\", and \"lose face\". English \"face\" meaning \"prestige; honor\" is the only case of a Chinese semantic loan. Semantic loans extend an indigenous word's meaning in conformity with a foreign model (e.g., French \"realiser\" \"achieve; create; construct\" used in the sense of English \"realize\"). The vast majority of English words from Chinese are ordinary loanwords with regular phonemic adaptation (e.g., \"chop suey\" < Cantonese \"tsap-sui\" \"miscellaneous pieces\"). A few are calques where a borrowing is blended with native elements (e.g., \"chopsticks\" < Pidgin \"chop\" \"quick, fast\" < Cantonese \"kap\" \"quick\" + \"stick\"). \"Face\" meaning \"prestige\" is technically a \"loan synonym\" owing to semantic overlap between the native English meaning \"outward semblance; effrontery\" and the borrowed Chinese meaning \"prestige; dignity\".\n\nWhen \"face\" acquired its Chinese sense of \"prestige; honor\", it filled a lexical gap in the English lexicon. Chan and Kwok write,\nThe Chinese has supplied a specific \"name\" for a \"thing\" embodying qualities not expressed or possibly not fully expressed, by a number of terms in English. The aptness of the figurative extension has probably also played a part (1985:61–62). \nCarr concludes,\nThe nearest English synonyms of the apt figurative \"face\" are \"prestige\", \"honor\", \"respect\", \"dignity\", \"status\", \"reputation\", \"social acceptance\", or \"good name\". explains how \"face\" is a more basic meaning than \"status\", \"dignity\", or \"honor\". \"Prestige\" appears to be semantically closest to \"face\", however a person can be said to have \"face\" but not \"prestige\", or vice versa. Prestige is not necessary; one can easily live without it, but hardly without \"face\".\n\nIn Arabic, the expression \"hafiẓa māʼ al-wajh\" (), which literally translate as \"save the face's water\", is used to mean \"save face\". The entire Arab culture of social and family behavior is based around Islamic concepts of dignity, or \"Face\". For Shia Islam, \"Face\" is based on the social and family ranking system found in the Treatise of Rights, Al-Risalah al-Huquq, Shia Islam's primary source for social behaviors.\n\nIn Persian, expressions like \"Aab ro rizi\" (آبروريزی) literally – \"losing the face's water\", is used to mean \"save face\" and \"Dou roi\" (دورويی) (lit. two-facedness), \"Ro seyahi \"(\"nq\") (lit. Black-facedness) meaning \"ashamed and embarrassed\" and \"Ro sepidi\" (روسپيدی) (lit. White-facedness) meaning \"proud\" (opposite of Ro seyahi) are used. In Iranian culture the meaning of linguistic face is much closer to the meaning of \"Character\". So Persian speakers use some strategies in saving the face or character of each other while they communicate.\n\nAmong South Slavs, especially in Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian, the word \"obraz\" (Cyrillic: образ) is used as a traditional expression for honor and the sociological concept of face. Medieval Slavic documents have shown that the word has been used with various meanings, such as form, image, character, person, symbol, face, figure, statue, idol, guise and mask. The languages also have a derived adjective \"bezobrazan\" (Cyrillic: безобразен) \"without face\", used to associate shame to a person.\n\nThe Thai word for face is หน้า [naa], meaning literally 'face'. There are basically two main ways of expressing loss of face. One, เสียหน้า, [sia naa] translates literally as 'lose face.' Another term, ขายหน้า, or [khai naa], means sale of face – actual connotation is that the person who lost face did so through fault of self or through the thoughtless action of another. As in China and other regions where loss of face is important, the Thai version involves sociodynamic status.\n\nThe Khmer word for face is មុខ [muk], meaning literally 'face'. បាត់​មុខ [bat muk] translates literally as 'lose face'. ទុក​មុខ [tuk muk] translates literally as 'save (i.e. preserve) face'. This concept is understood and treated much the same in Cambodia as elsewhere in Asia.\n\nThe concept of \"face\" or \"chemyon\" ( , ) is extremely important in Korean culture.\n\n\"Face\" is central to sociology and sociolinguistics. Martin C. Yang analyzed eight sociological factors in losing or gaining face: the kinds of equality between the people involved, their ages, personal sensibilities, inequality in social status, social relationship, consciousness of personal prestige, presence of a witness, and the particular social value/sanction involved.\n\nThe sociologist Erving Goffman introduced the concept of \"face\" into social theory with his (1955) article \"On Face-work: An Analysis of Ritual Elements of Social Interaction\" and (1967) book \"Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior\". According to Goffman's dramaturgical perspective, face is a mask that changes depending on the audience and the variety of social interaction. People strive to maintain the face they have created in social situations. They are emotionally attached to their faces, so they feel good when their faces are maintained; loss of face results in emotional pain, so in social interactions people cooperate by using politeness strategies to maintain each other's faces.\n\n\"Face\" is sociologically universal. People \"are human\", Joseph Agassi and I. C. Jarvie (1969:140) believe, \"because they have face to care for – without it they lose human dignity.\" Hu elaborates:\nThe point is that face is distinctively human. Anyone who does not wish to declare his social bankruptcy must show a regard for face: he must claim for himself, and must extend to others, some degree of compliance, respect, and deference in order to maintain a minimum level of effective social functioning. While it is true that the conceptualization of what constitutes face and the rules governing face behavior vary considerably across cultures, the concern for face is invariant. Defined at a high level of generality, the concept of face is a universal.\nThe sociological concept of face has recently been reanalyzed through consideration of the Chinese concepts of face (mianzi and lian) which permits deeper understanding of the various dimensions of experience of face, including moral and social evaluation, and its emotional mechanisms.\n\nAccording to Hu (1944), mianzi stands for 'the kind of prestige that is emphasized...a reputation achieved through getting on in life, through success and ostentation', while face is 'the respect of a group for a man with a good moral reputation: the man who will fulfill his obligations regardless of the hardships involved, who under all circumstances shows himself a decent human being'. The concept seems to relate to two different meanings, from one side Chinese consumers try to increase or maintain their reputation (mianzi) in front of socially and culturally significant others (e.g. friends); on the other hand, they try to defend or save face.\n\nMianzi is not only important to improve the consumer's reputation in front of significant others, but rather it is also associated with feelings of dignity, honor, and pride. In consumer behaviour literature, mianzi has been used to explain Chinese consumer purchasing behaviour and brand choice and considered it as a ‘quality’ owned by some brands. Some consumers tend to favour some brands (and their products and services) because of their capacity to enable them to 'gain' mianzi, which does not mean simply increase their reputation but also to show achievements and communicate these achievements to others in order to be more accepted in social circles, especially upper class circles. Chinese consumers tend to believe that if they buy some brands it is easier to be accepted in the social circles of powerful and wealthy people. Connections are particularly important in Chinese culture as people use social connections to achieve their goals.\n\nHowever, mianzi has also an emotional facet. Consumers feel proud, special, honoured, even more valuable as individuals if they can afford to buy brands that can enhance their mianzi. Therefore, some branded products and services, especially those that require conspicuous consumption (e.g. smartphones, bags, shoes), are chosen because they foster feelings of pride and vanity in the owner.\n\nA brand that enables an individual to achieve such goals in life, in branding literature, it is labelled as 'brand mianzi', which is the capacity of a brand to provide emotions and self-enhancement to its owner.\nScholars have proved that brand mianzi affects consumer purchase intentions and brand equity.\n\nIn summary, mianzi is a cultural concept that relates to the social, emotional and psychological dimension of consumption and has an impact on consumers’ perception of their self and purchase decisions. Purchase and consumption of brands (but also other activities, like choosing a specific university), in Chinese culture, are profoundly affected by mianzi and different brands can be more or less apt to enhance or maintain mianzi, while others can cause a loss of face.\n\nPenelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson (1987) expanded Goffman's theory of face in their politeness theory, which differentiated between positive and negative face.\n\n\nIn human interactions, people are often forced to threaten either an addressee's positive and/or negative face, and so there are various politeness strategies to mitigate those face-threatening acts.\n\nTae-Seop Lim and John Waite Bowers (1991) claim that face is the public image that a person claims for himself. Within this claim there are three dimensions. \"\"Autonomy face\"\" describes a desire to appear independent, in control, and responsible. \"\"Fellowship face\"\" describes a desire to seem cooperative, accepted, and loved. \"\"Competence face\"\" describes a desire to appear intelligent, accomplished, and capable.\n\nOetzel et al. (2000) defined \"facework\" as \"the communicative strategies one uses to enact self-face and to uphold, support, or challenge another person's face\". In terms of interpersonal communication, Facework refers to an individual's identity in a social world and how that identity is created, reinforced, diminished, and maintained in communicative interactions.\n\nFacework represents the transition from the real self of the individual to the image he or she represents to society for the communicative or leadership purposes. This concept is all about presentation of the dignified image which soon will become as an authority for other individuals. Facework is a skill of constantly maintaining the face in order to deserve the respect and honor from it. For instance, Individualistic cultures like United States, Canada, and Germany are standing for the position of protecting the self-face of the individual while collectivist cultures such as China, South Korea, and Japan support the idea of maintaining the other-face for self-dignity and self-respect\n\nThere are also exist other facework strategies not always basing on the culture strategies like face-negotiating, face-constituting, face-compensating, face-honoring, face-saving, face-threatening, face-building, face-protecting, face-depreciating, face-giving, face-restoring, and face-neutral.\n\nFace is central to intercultural communication or cross-cultural communication. Bert Brown explains the importance of both personal and national face in international negotiations:\nAmong the most troublesome kinds of problems that arise in negotiation are the intangible issues related to loss of face. In some instances, protecting against loss of face becomes so central an issue that it swamps the importance of the tangible issues at stake and generates intense conflicts that can impede progress toward agreement and increase substantially the costs of conflict resolution. (1977:275) \n\nIn terms of Edward T. Hall's dichotomy between high context cultures focused upon in-groups and low context cultures focused upon individuals, face-saving is generally viewed as more important in high context cultures such as China or Japan than in low-context ones such as the United States or Germany.\n\nStella Ting-Toomey developed Face Negotiation Theory to explain cultural differences in communication and conflict resolution. Ting-Toomey defines face as\nthe interaction between the degree of threats or considerations one party offers to another party, and the degree of claim for a sense of self-respect (or demand for respect toward one's national image or cultural group) put forth by the other party in a given situation. (1990) \n\nThe psychology of \"face\" is another field of research. Wolfram Eberhard, who analyzed Chinese \"guilt\" and \"sin\" in terms of literary psychology, debunked the persistent myth that \"face\" is peculiar to the Chinese rather than a force in every human society. Eberhard noted\nIt is mainly in the writings of foreigners that we find the stress upon shame in Chinese society; it is they who stated that the Chinese were typically afraid of \"losing their face\". It is they who reported many cases of suicide because of loss of face, or of suicide in order to punish another person after one's death as a ghost, or to cause through suicide endless difficulties or even punishment to the other person. But in the Chinese literature used here, including also the short stories, I did not once find the phrase \"losing face\"; and there was no clear case of suicide because of shame alone. (1967:119–120) \n\nThe Chinese University of Hong Kong social psychologist Michael Harris Bond observed that in Hong Kong,\nGiven the importance of having face and of being related to those who do, there is a plethora of relationship politics in Chinese culture. Name dropping, eagerness to associate with the rich and famous, the use of external status symbols, sensitivity to insult, lavish gift-giving, the use of titles, the sedulous avoidance of criticism, all abound, and require considerable readjustment for someone used to organizing social life by impersonal rules, frankness, and greater equality. (1991:59)\n\n\"Face\" has further applications in political science. For instance, Susan Pharr (1989) stressed the importance of \"losing face\" in Japanese comparative politics.\n\nLinguists have analyzed the semantics of \"face\". Huang (1985, cited above) used prototype semantics to differentiate \"lian\" and \"mianzi\". George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's \"Metaphors We Live By\" (1980:37) emphasizes \"the face for the person\" metonymy. Keith Allan (1986) extended \"face\" into theoretical semantics. He postulated it to be an essential element of all language interchanges, and claimed: \"A satisfactory theory of linguistic meaning cannot ignore questions of face presentation, nor other politeness phenomena that maintain the co-operative nature of language interchange.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The field tensor was first used after the four-dimensional tensor formulation of special relativity was introduced by Hermann Minkowski. The tensor allows related physical laws to be written very concisely.\n\nThe electromagnetic tensor, conventionally labelled \"F\", is defined as the exterior derivative of the electromagnetic four-potential, \"A\", a differential 1-form:\n\nTherefore, \"F\" is a differential 2-form—that is, an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field—on Minkowski space. In component form,\n\nwhere formula_3 is the four-gradient and formula_4 is the four-potential.\n\nSI units for Maxwell's equations and the particle physicist's sign convention for the signature of Minkowski space , will be used throughout this article.\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields can be obtained from the components of the electromagnetic tensor. The relationship is simplest in Cartesian coordinates:\n\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light, and\nwhere formula_7 is the Levi-Civita tensor. This gives the fields in a particular reference frame; if the reference frame is changed, the components of the electromagnetic tensor will transform covariantly, and the fields in the new frame will be given by the new components.\n\nIn contravariant matrix form,\n\nThe covariant form is given by index lowering,\n\nThe Faraday tensor's Hodge dual is \n\nFrom now on in this article, when the electric or magnetic fields are mentioned, a Cartesian coordinate system is assumed, and the electric and magnetic fields are with respect to the coordinate system's reference frame, as in the equations above.\n\nThe matrix form of the field tensor yields the following properties:\n\nThis tensor simplifies and reduces Maxwell's equations as four vector calculus equations into two tensor field equations. In electrostatics and electrodynamics, Gauss's law and Ampère's circuital law are respectively:\n\nand reduce to the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation:\n\nIn magnetostatics and magnetodynamics, Gauss's law for magnetism and Maxwell–Faraday equation are respectively:\n\nwhich reduce to Bianchi identity:\n\nor using the index notation with square brackets for the antisymmetric part of the tensor:\n\nThe field tensor derives its name from the fact that the electromagnetic field is found to obey the tensor transformation law, this general property of physical laws being recognised after the advent of special relativity. This theory stipulated that all the laws of physics should take the same form in all coordinate systems – this led to the introduction of tensors. The tensor formalism also leads to a mathematically simpler presentation of physical laws.\n\nThe inhomogeneous Maxwell equation leads to the continuity equation:\n\nimplying conservation of charge.\n\nMaxwell's laws above can be generalised to curved spacetime by simply replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives:\n\nwhere the semi-colon notation represents a covariant derivative, as opposed to a partial derivative. These equations are sometimes referred to as the curved space Maxwell equations. Again, the second equation implies charge conservation (in curved spacetime):\n\nClassical electromagnetism and Maxwell's equations can be derived from the action:\n\nwhere\n\nThis means the Lagrangian density is\n\nThe two middle terms in the parentheses are the same, as are the two outer terms, so the Lagrangian density is\n\nSubstituting this into the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion for a field:\n\nSo the Euler–Lagrange equation becomes:\n\nThe quantity in parentheses above is just the field tensor, so this finally simplifies to\n\nThat equation is another way of writing the two inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations (namely, Gauss's law and Ampère's circuital law) using the substitutions:\n\nwhere \"i, j, k\" take the values 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe Hamiltonian density can be obtained with the usual relation,\n\nThe Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics extends beyond the classical Lagrangian established in relativity to incorporate the creation and annihilation of photons (and electrons):\n\nwhere the first part in the right hand side, containing the Dirac spinor formula_31, represents the Dirac field. In quantum field theory it is used as the template for the gauge field strength tensor. By being employed in addition to the local interaction Lagrangian it reprises its usual role in QED.\n\n\n"}

It is a large suburb, and adjoins the suburbs of Calamvale, Coopers Plains, Sunnybank, MacGregor, Algester, Acacia Ridge and Runcorn.\n\nSunnybank Hills was originally part of a much larger area known as Coopers Plains. In 1885, the railway line was extended from Yeerongpilly, and names had to be given to the railway stations built along the line. One of the stations was named after a local farm, Sunny Brae, when of land were taken over for the railway. \"Brae\" is the Scottish word for the English word \"bank\", so the area was given boundaries and named Sunnybank. The area of Sunnybank Hills was officially defined in 1971, although it had been unofficially called this for many years.\n\nThe Sunnybank Hills Public Library opened in 1987 with a major refurbishment in 2009.\n\nSunnybank Hills has numerous ridges and hills, with lower wetter areas in the north and east. These form the marshes near Sunnybank and Runcorn railway stations. There are many parks and greenspaces in the area. The soil is fertile and watered by numerous small creeks, including a large one that flows north–south across the suburb, and the suburb borders on the small wildfowl habitat and wetlands of neighbouring Calamvale Creek.\n\nIn the , Sunnybank Hills recorded a population of 16,830 people: 50.4% female and 49.6% male.\n\nThe median age of the Sunnybank Hills population was 34 years, 3 years below the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 16.3% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 12.4% of the population.\n\nSunnybank Hills is a very multicultural suburb. 46.7% of people living in Sunnybank Hills were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were China 10.5%, Taiwan 6.6%, New Zealand 4.3%, India 2.5%, England 2.2%. Just under half (49.7%) of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 17.8% Mandarin, 6.5% Cantonese, 2.3% Vietnamese, 2.2% Korean, 1.2% Greek. According to the , Sunnybank Hills includes the largest communities of both Chinese Australians (5,647 people; 25.4%) and Serbian Australians (178 people; 1.0%) of any suburb in Queensland.\n\nAlmost half (47%) of the family households in the suburb were couples with children, 35% were couples without children, 15% are single-parent households, and 3% are classified as \"other family\". The great majority (85%) of the dwellings in the suburb are stand-alone houses; townhouses account for another 12%. The houses are mainly modern brick and tile houses but there is a sprinkling of post-war weatherboard homes in the area.\n\nThe most common religious affiliation was \"No Religion\" (24.3%); the next most common responses were Catholic 20.1%, Anglican 9.6%, Buddhism 9.0% and Uniting Church 5.5%.\n\nThe Brisbane City Council operates a public library in Sunnybank Hills in the Sunnybank Hills Shopping Centre at the corner of Compton and Calam Roads.\n\nChurches in Sunnybank Hills include the Southside International Church on the corner of Pinelands and Beenleigh Roads, and Sunnybank Hills Uniting Church on the corner of Hellawell Road and Hillcrest Street. \n\nThe suburb is serviced by several shopping centres. These include Shauna Downs on the corner of Wynne Street and Beenleigh Road, Centro Pinelands on Mains Road, and the large Sunnybank Hills Shoppingtown on the corner of Compton & Calam Roads. Sunnybank Hills Shoppingtown features a Woolworths supermarket, Coles supermarket, K Mart, Priceline, Best & Less, The Reject Shop, Lincraft, Aldi, library and 75 specialty stores.\n\nApproximately 25% (ABS 2006 Census) of the population is Asian born, and the cultural scene is brought to life with many Asian restaurants, along with numerous coffee shops and eateries of many cultures. Restaurants in Sunnybank Hills and neighbouring Sunnybank include Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Italian cuisines.\n\nMany bus stops with buses running directly to the city every couple of minutes during peak times (does not require transfer). The suburb is also serviced by the train stations, Sunnybank and Altandi, which provide services to the Brisbane CBD and Beenleigh lines.\n\nThe local school is Sunnybank Hills State School in Symons Road.

The bridge is long and stands above water level.\n\nConstruction of the bridge began in 1938 and it opened on July 12, 1940, as a toll bridge. The bridge cost $1.75 million to construct. It was designed by Ash-Howard-Needles & Tammen and built by the American Bridge Company, McCarthy Improvement Company, and Priester Construction Company. The original toll was $0.10, and eventually rose to $0.50 for automobiles (and as high as $2.00 for semi-trucks). Early in the bridge's history, pedestrians paid a $0.05 walker's fee; this fee ended in 1960. The tolls for motorists ended on May 2, 2003. On that day, a ceremony was held to commemorate the occasion and to honor the toll workers and all of those who had worked for the bridge during the toll era. The bridge had been under the management of Sue Nelson before going toll-free. The Dohrn Transfer Company of Rock Island, the first official toll-paying vehicle to cross the bridge in 1949, was the last official patron of the bridge.\n\nOn September 4, 1988, 128 sodium lamps were installed on the arches, making the bridge a scenic sight at night. River Action Inc. raised funds for the lighting project through their initiative \"Lights! River! Action!\".\n\nOn July 13, 2005, the city of Rock Island transferred ownership of the bridge to the Illinois Department of Transportation after the completion of a project costing over $11 million in structural upgrades to the bridge.\n\nIt was originally going to be named the Galbraith Bridge, after Rock Island's mayor at the time, Robert Galbraith. He suggested it be named the Centennial Bridge, in commemoration of the city of Rock Island's centennial. In 2017, the bridge was officially renamed as the Master Sgt. Stanley Talbot Memorial Bridge.\n\nThe five arches of the bridge are a symbol often used to represent the Quad Cities. The two largest arches symbolize Rock Island and Davenport while the smaller ones represent the other surrounding Quad-Cities (Bettendorf, Moline, and East Moline). Modern Woodmen Park in Davenport is just upriver from the bridge. On the Rock Island side, \"The District,\" the nightlife hub of the Quad Cities, is about one block east of the bridge.\n\n"}

He was the father of Sajida Talfah, Saddam's first wife, and of Adnan Khairallah, defence minister. Saddam made Khairallah Talfah mayor of Baghdad, but was forced to remove him due to Talfah's corruption.\n\nTalfah is the author of \"\".\n\nTalfah was born in 1910 in the village of Al-Awja, 5 km south of Tikrit, and then part of the Baghdad Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nTalfah, a teacher and an Arab nationalist, was a member of the al-Jawwal society and later participated as an Iraqi Army Officer in the Army revolt of 1941 led by Rasheed A'ali Al-Gaylani against the Iraqi Royal institution supported by the occupying British forces. The revolt did not achieve any major changes, with the British dispatching a taskforce which occupied the country and re-installed the ousted pro-British Regent 'Abd al-Ilah. Many Iraqi soldiers who had participated in the revolt were pardoned, largely keeping their ranks and military position. Talfah was expelled from the army and spent six years in prison for his part in the revolt.\n\nHe would later play a role in the founding of the anti-British and Arab nationalist Iraqi Independence Party. He was released from prison in 1947. Following his release he returned to Tikrit, where his nephew Saddam Hussein moved back in with him and began school. Saddam had previously lived with Talfah prior to the 1941 coup and subsequent war, but had moved back in with his parents during Talfah's imprisonment. Unlike Talfah, Saddam's mother and step-father beat him and prevented him from receiving an education.\n\nHe became the Governor of Baghdad in 1958, a member of the Higher Education and Scientific Research Council in 1972, and served as head of the Civil Service Board from 1973 to 1982.\n\nHe became President of the Association of Veteran Warriors جمعية المحاربين القدماء after the Baath party took control of power in 1968.\n\nHe collected a considerable wealth using his influence as a close family member of both Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein. He formed a retail and property organisation widely known as Khairallah Talfah Society جمعية خير الله طلفاح . One of the greatest money generators was buying worthless farmland on cities outskirts where residential land was at very short supply, dividing them into thousands of residential plots, then selling them on at a high profit to people, usually government workers like military, police, teachers, and others.\n\nHe headed the War Veterans Society (Veteran Warriors or more commonly called the Khairallah Talfah Society, جمعية خير الله طلفاح). With the huge shortages of almost all consumer goods that became the new phenomena soon after the Baath Party took power on 17 July 1968, the Khairallah Talfah Society جمعية خير الله طلفاح was importing goods at the heavily subsidised dinar/dollar rates then making considerable profits from selling these goods on to very grateful people.\n\nWhen he became Mayor of Baghdad in early 1970s, he was more preoccupied by \"morality\" and \"righteous behaviour\" than other duties. He ordered the security service and police force to spray paint on legs of any woman wearing short skirts, and tearing the bell-bottom trousers worn by any male or female. These trousers were fashionable at the time. These actions against any \"Westernised\" contemporary trends only lasted for a few weeks and were terminated abruptly, probably when Vice President Saddam Hussein intervened. These \"trendy\" fashions subsequently spread all over the country and had been worn even by Talfah's own sons and daughters.\n\nHe sympathized with the Nazi regime.\n\nHe was quite outspoken and could be quite blunt and sometimes inconsiderate with people he disagreed with. He was known to have been quite opinionated, sharp of tongue, and occasionally obnoxious, though he tried to portray himself as a strict religious figure.\n\nShortly before his death, he had his leg(s) amputated as a result of diabetes. It is widely known that he loved candy and all things sweet, especially Swedish Fish.\n\nHis sons and daughters were known to behave like miniatures of their father. It was alleged that they could be quite unpleasant to people, expecting others to show obedience, deference and acknowledge their superiority.\n\nHis daughter Ilham إلهام (born 1955 and later died of cancer) was schooled in the famously good and strict Christian convent girls' school of Rahibat Al-Taqdomah مدرسة راهبات التقدمة. Ilham was the sister of Sajida (Saddam's wife) and Adnan Khairallah (Defence Minister). All three were the offspring of Talfah's first wife.\n\nThe daughters of President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr were in that school راهبات التقدمة before Ilham. Al-Bakr's daughters were known to have been very well behaved, mingling seamlessly with all others and not showing any of the superiority and arrogance that became the usual behaviour of Khairallah Talfah's daughter Ilham. It is reported that Ilham disagreed with a Kurd girl's opinion in a religious education lesson; then the secret service, sent by her father Talfah the next morning, arrested the young girl who was then reportedly released after a few days but never joined the school again. Ilham was reportedly saying that she had to get her arrested to teach her and any other person who dares to \"behave inappropriately\" a good lesson.\n\nIlham married Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's son, only to divorce from him as soon as Saddam took power from Al-Bakr, allegedly through the influence of her father Talfah. Ilham then married Watban وطبان, Saddam's half brother.\n\nKhairallah Talfah's son Lou'ay لؤي was shot with a hand gun in 1983 while in the resort of Habbaniya. The bullet fractured his femur and an emergency surgery to fix the fracture with a plate and screws was performed in Rasheed Military Hospital in Baghdad on the same night. He made a full recovery after a few weeks' stay in Rasheed Military Hospital Officers' Fracture ward. The surgery was performed by Major General Doctor Moflih Al-Dulaimi اللواء الطبيب مفلح فارس الدليمي اختصاصي جراحة العظام والكسور who happened to have been on-on call that night.

The National Collegiate Championship remains as the NCAA's top-level championship, but Division III members now have their own championship event.\n\nWith the introduction of an official Division III championship, schools in that division are no longer eligible for the National Collegiate Championship. The last exception was Rutgers–Newark, whose men's volleyball program had been a grandfathered scholarship program, and could compete for the National Collegiate Championship through 2014. Rutgers–Newark completed a transition to Division III men's volleyball at the end of that season, and joined the D-III Continental Volleyball Conference effective with the 2015 season.\n\nThere are three general regions for men's volleyball: \"West\", \"Midwest\", and \"East\". Four \"major conferences\", defined here as leagues that include full members of Division I, represent these regions. The three \"traditional\" major conferences are the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA), and Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA). In the 2018 season, the ranks of \"major\" conferences expanded to include the Big West Conference, the first Division I all-sports conference ever to sponsor men's volleyball. As of the next NCAA men's volleyball season in 2021, two Division II conferences will sponsor men's volleyball at the National Collegiate level. Conference Carolinas (CC) was the first NCAA conference ever to sponsor men's volleyball as a scholarship sport, having launched its men's volleyball league in the 2012 season. The 2021 season will be the first the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAC), which will have six men's volleyball members. CC has had an automatic berth in the National Collegiate championship since the 2014 season, and the Big West received an automatic berth upon the creation of its men's volleyball league, while the SIAC will not be eligible for an automatic berth until the 2023 season (assuming that all six inaugural men's volleyball members continue to play in that conference). Members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), a separate athletics governing body whose members are primarily smaller institutions, regularly play matches against NCAA teams.\n\nBecause of the historic lack of an official divisional structure in men's volleyball, all four major conferences have members that normally compete in Division II. Before the creation of the Division III national championship, the EIVA had several Division III members, but all of those schools now compete in D-III men's volleyball. Barring any further changes in conference membership or men's volleyball sponsorship, the Big West will become the first men's volleyball conference to consist entirely of D-I members in the 2021 season, the first after current Big West men's volleyball affiliate UC San Diego starts its transition to Division I and becomes a full Big West member.\n\nThrough the 2013 tournament, each of the three major conferences (MPSF, MIVA and EIVA) received an automatic bid to the Final Four, with one additional at-large bid. The remaining bid was an at-large bid that could be awarded to any team in Division I or II (including Rutgers–Newark). Generally, the best team not receiving an automatic bid (usually from one of the three major conferences) received the at-large bid.\n\nBeginning with the 2014 championship, the field expanded to six teams, with the two new teams being the champion of Conference Carolinas and one extra at-large entry. The new format featured two quarterfinal matches involving the four lowest-seeded teams in the field, with the winners joining the two top seeds in the semifinals. Originally, the quarterfinals were to be played at campus sites, with the Final Four at a separate predetermined site, but it was decided instead to have the entire championship tournament at one site.\n\nWith the Big West Conference adding men's volleyball for the 2018 season and qualifying for an automatic tournament berth, the championship now involves seven teams. The bottom two tournament seeds contest a \"play-in\" match; from that point, the tournament format is identical to the one used from 2014 to 2017.\n\nThe number of Division I schools sponsoring men's volleyball has fluctuated between 20 and 24 teams since 1986. No traditional D-I conferences sponsored men's volleyball until the Big West Conference added the sport for the 2018 season. Of the other three major conferences, the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA) and Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA) are volleyball-specific conferences, while the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) is a multi-sport conference of schools whose primary conferences do not sponsor its ten sports. In addition to the 23 D-I schools, 26 Division II schools competed in D-I volleyball in the coronavirus-shortened 2020 men's volleyball season:\n\nThe Division II Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference will begin men's volleyball competition in the 2021 season with six newly launched teams, all full conference members—Benedict, Central State, Fort Valley State, Kentucky State, Morehouse, and Paine. Additionally, D'Youville, a Division III member which played the 2020 season in its full-time home of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference, will join the National Collegiate division for the 2021 season as it starts a transition to Division II and the East Coast Conference, which sponsors volleyball only for women.\n\nDivision II does not have a separate national championship, and neither Division I nor II has a sufficient number of teams to sponsor a national championship without the other.\n\n†Vacated due to NCAA violations\n\nHistorically, California-based universities have dominated the men's volleyball national championship; Loyola Chicago, Penn State, Ohio State and BYU are the only non-California universities to have won the National Collegiate championship; Hawaii and Lewis also won the championship tournament, but had their victories vacated due to NCAA rules violations. Only seven non-California universities have participated in the National Collegiate championship match (Loyola, BYU, Penn State, Ohio State, IPFW, Hawaii, and Lewis), although other universities such as Princeton and Ball State have participated in the final four. Only four finals have involved two non-California schools: the 2003 final, when Lewis defeated BYU but had its win vacated; the 2015 final, in which Loyola defeated Lewis; and the 2016 and 2017 finals, when Ohio State defeated BYU.\n\nUCLA, Southern California, Penn State, Stanford, and Long Beach State are the only schools in Division I to have won an NCAA national championship in both men and women's volleyball. (But for Hawaii's vacated 2002 title, it would have matched this feat with 3 NCAA and 1 AIAW women's national championships.) In addition, Stanford (1996–97) and Penn State (2007–08) are the only universities whose men and women's volleyball programs won the national championship in the same academic year. The 2016 championship tournament took place from May 3–7 at Rec Hall on the campus of Penn State.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1912395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912395", "title": "Day of Vengeance", "text": "Day of Vengeance\n\nDay of Vengeance is a six-issue comic book limited series written by Bill Willingham, with art by Justiniano and Walden Wong, published in 2005 by DC Comics.\n\n\"Day of Vengeance\" is one of four limited series leading up to DC Comics' \"Infinite Crisis\" event. It focuses on the Spectre and other magical beings of the DC Universe, especially a hastily-formed group known as the Shadowpact. The series has tie-ins to other ongoing DC Comics series, including \"JSA\" #73-75 and #77 and \"Blood of the Demon\" #6-7. It is a prelude to \"Infinite Crisis\" #1.\n\nThe events of this series were preceded by the story arc teaming Superman and Captain Marvel from \"Action Comics\" #826, \"The Adventures of Superman\" #639 and \"Superman\" #216.\n\nJean Loring, ex-wife of Ray Palmer (the Atom) and murderer of Sue Dibny in 2004's seven-issue limited series \"Identity Crisis\", is transformed into a new version of the villainous Eclipso by mysterious forces. Loring escapes from her Arkham Asylum cell to unknown whereabouts. Meanwhile, the Spectre, the vengeful right hand of God, is now without a host since of Hal Jordan. Eclipso persuades the Spectre that magic is evil because it breaks the laws of nature set by God. This logic makes sense to the hostless Spectre, who vows to destroy all magic.\n\nHaving witnessed his attack firsthand, the Enchantress summons the Ragman to the Mist Woods to save her from the Spectre, who has just defeated and killed \"seven hundred combat trained sorcerers\" who were having an informal gathering. As Blackbriar Thorn provides a distraction, they retreat to the Oblivion Bar, a bar between dimensions where magically powered beings meet to trade war stories. The subject of the day at the bar is the Spectre and his attacks on magic across the world. The bartender is Jim Rook (the Nightmaster) and the bouncer is Blue Devil. When the Enchantress proclaims that the magic world needs to make a stand against the Spectre, she gets no agreement, save for Detective Chimp.\n\nDetective Chimp reveals that the Phantom Stranger, one of several \"big-gun\" magicians that the Ragman believes is better suited for this type of fight, has been turned into a mouse, emphasizing the importance of fighting the Spectre. These five are joined by Nightshade as the Shadowpact and they all agree to take the fight to the Spectre. While the mystics plan this attack, the ancient wizard Shazam recruits his champion Captain Marvel in a bid against the Spectre. Also notable is that the other \"big-guns\" mentioned by the patrons in the bar were Doctor Fate and Madame Xanadu. Both have already been disabled by the Spectre, Doctor Fate being imprisoned in the dimension within his helmet and Madame Xanadu having been blinded by the Spectre, disabling her abilities to interpret magic.\n\nThrough the Enchantress, the group, later named the Shadowpact, learn that the Spectre was being seduced and corrupted by Eclipso. They plan what is essentially a suicide mission to find the Spectre (and Eclipso), attack Eclipso with overwhelming surprise and numbers and to kill her, hoping to free the Spectre before he turns on them. As the Enchantress, Blue Devil, Ragman and Nightmaster teleport in, they happen on Captain Marvel fighting a duel of magic vs. spirit, which gives them the time and a chance to try to defeat Eclipso while the Spectre is distracted. Hoping to give Captain Marvel more time to hold off the Spectre (which gives them more time to defeat Eclipso), the Enchantress siphons magical energy first from herself; then from mystics around the world, including heroes such as Alan Scott, Zatanna, the Phantom Stranger (still in mouse form); villains like Blackbriar Thorn; and finally, ordinary mortals with little magic power, adding to Captain Marvel's own magical power. Meanwhile, Detective Chimp and Nightshade work on a backup plan by trying to bring back Black Alice, a girl with the power to steal another's magical abilities for a short period of time, leaving her target powerless. The Shadowpact defeats Eclipso when Blue Devil skewers Eclipso with his Trident of Lucifer, while Captain Marvel gains the upper hand over the Spectre, thanks to the tens of thousands of magic users supporting him. However, the strain of gathering such immense quantities of magic drives the Enchantress temporarily insane, and she releases her link to Captain Marvel to battle her own teammates. Captain Marvel's strength fades, and he is barely defeated by the Spectre. The Spectre, who is now heavily drained, rescues a stunned Eclipso, and Eclipso uses the last of her power to fly both of them away to safety. Blue Devil knocks the Enchantress out, and the Shadowpact return to the Oblivion Bar with Captain Marvel to regroup, surprised to be alive, and amazed to have temporarily beaten back the Spectre.\n\nThe Shadowpact, along with Black Alice, decide on their next plan of attack: they will kill the Spectre and defeat Eclipso before she can complete her war on magic by using Black Alice's ability to steal powers. The plan reaches a snag, however, when a powerless Spectre is revealed to be an empty spirit who cannot be harmed. During her brief possession of the Spectre's powers, Black Alice uses them to help Nightshade send Eclipso into a perpetual orbit around the sun, which weakens her power.\n\nCaptain Marvel, meanwhile, has returned to the Rock of Eternity, where the wizard Shazam reveals that he is ready to face the Spectre. The restored Spectre travels to the Rock of Eternity to battle the wizard Shazam, changing Captain Marvel back into Billy Batson, his alter ego, to keep him out of his way. The Phantom Stranger, returning to his human form, uses his powers to allow the Shadowpact and Black Alice to watch the battle between Shazam and the Spectre from Earth. After it appears that Shazam has beaten his opponent, the Spectre revives himself, drains the wizard of his powers, and kills him. The Rock of Eternity begins to disintegrate, and travels through several dimensions as it does so, eventually appearing in the sky above Gotham City before it explodes into \"a billion pieces\".\n\nThe destruction of the Rock frees an untold number beings of evil magic back into the world, among them the \"living\" embodiments of the Seven Deadly Sins, who were formerly trapped in stone statues in Shazam's throne room. The scarab belonging to the original Blue Beetle, which Shazam had acquired from his successor, Ted Kord, lands in El Paso, Texas. Billy Batson, unable to remember his magic word, is seen falling from the Rock above Gotham City; the scene leads directly into \"Infinite Crisis\" #1. The Shadowpact, meanwhile, agrees to continue the fight, but will do so without Black Alice, who, as she is still a teenager, plans to return home.\n\nIn \"Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special\" #1, Zatanna leads a group of magical heroes to rebuild the Rock of Eternity, as the Shadowpact recover the Seven Deadly Sins of Man. Meanwhile above Earth, Nabu fights the Spectre. The Spectre kills Nabu; however, the severity of this action is noticed by the Presence, who then sends the Spectre into a new host, Crispus Allen, as punishment for his actions.\n\nAfter construction of the Rock is completed, Captain Marvel is told that he must remain in the Rock to keep it, and the forces contained within, stable. Nightshade is captured by Felix Faust on the orders of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The heroes are told by the dying Nabu that the Ninth Age of Magic has ended and that the Tenth Age will soon begin. Before entombing himself into the Rock, Captain Marvel hurls Nabu's helmet from the Rock at the suggestion of Detective Chimp, letting fate decide who will become the next Doctor Fate.\n\nThe series and other comics have been collected into a trade paperback:\n\n\nThe one-shot special was collected in \"Infinite Crisis Companion\" ().\n\nNote that this new definition of magic in DC titles will not be shared with the definition of magic in Vertigo, DC's sister imprint, despite previous crossovers. Grant Morrison has stated that author Michael Moorcock had written the \"Magic Bible\" for DC, describing how magic works and how magical characters interact. A key aspect of this new magic is to show, as with everything else, that there is a cost associated with using magic. \"Infinite Crisis\" #6 features a scene where many mystics and magic beings summon the Spectre at Stonehenge, only to have him kill Star Sapphire before disappearing. The dawning of the Tenth Age of Magic will be featured in the \"Shadowpact\" ongoing series.\n\n"}

{"id": "1912402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912402", "title": "Starz Encore", "text": "Starz Encore\n\nStarz Encore (originally named Encore from its launch in April 1991 until April 2016) is an American premium channel that is owned by Lions Gate Entertainment. Its programming features mainly older and recent theatrically released feature films, although some of its multiplex channels also carry acquired television series. The headquarters of Starz Encore, and its sister channels Starz and MoviePlex, are located at the Meridian International Business Center complex in Meridian, Colorado, United States.\n\n, Starz Encore's programming is available to approximately 39.709 million television households (34.1% of cable, satellite and telco customers) in the United States (38.310 million subscribers or 32.9% of all households with pay television service receive at least Starz Encore's primary channel). This outpaces HBO's 35.8 million pay subscribers (also as of February 2015) to make Starz Encore the largest premium channel by overall reach in the United States.\n\nStarz Encore has a higher subscriber base than its competitors and sister channels because, although Starz and Starz Encore are often sold together in a singular package, some digital cable, telco and satellite providers offer the Starz Encore multiplex separately from Starz as part of an a la carte tier in which it is packaged with other commercial-free and advertiser-supported film-oriented channels (such as Epix, FX Movie Channel and Lifetime Movies). Therefore, Starz Encore subscribers do not necessarily have to subscribe to Starz in order to receive the channel.\n\nEncore launched at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 1, 1991, on four cable systems that were operated by Tele-Communications Inc. (both TCI and Liberty Media, both of which jointly owned Encore initially, were controlled by John Malone). The channel debuted with an introduction by founder John Sie, who served as the president of the network from its launch until 1999 and CEO until his retirement in 2004, which was then followed by Encore's first movie telecast, the 1980 comedy film \"9 to 5\". Encore was the first major U.S. premium channel to debut in almost 11 years, since Cinemax launched on August 1, 1980 – at the time of Encore's launch, Cinemax, HBO, Showtime and The Movie Channel were its only competitors (Encore was the only upstart premium channel that managed to gain any headway with those services; other premium channels that debuted prior to Encore's launch, such as Spotlight and Home Theater Network, were unable to compete with those four channels and would eventually shut down during the prior decade).\n\nInitially, Encore focused on movies released primarily during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with some releases from the 1950s mixed in; the channel was formatted similarly to American Movie Classics at the time, with hosted introductions leading into the movie presentations. Breaks between films on Encore during its early years were quite lively, consisting less of promotions and more of trivia and nostalgia, fitting in with Encore's motto \"The Movies of Your Life.\" The channel even ran an interstitial during breaks within its daytime schedule that informed viewers about programs that were scheduled to air on competing premium channels that evening in prime time. The channel had initially broadcast films from Warner Bros. Pictures (owned by Time Warner, which ironically is the parent company of rival pay services HBO and Cinemax), Columbia Pictures/TriStar Pictures, Orion Pictures, 20th Century Fox, The Samuel Goldwyn Company, Paramount Pictures (which also ironically came under ownership of Showtime and The Movie Channel's then-parent company Viacom in 1994), Turner Entertainment, and MGM/United Artists. The channel was formatted as a \"mini-pay\" service, available to subscribers for a $1 monthly fee.\n\nTCI initially offered Encore as a negative option, in which customers were required to notify TCI if they declined to subscribe to the channel full-time after an introductory offer, or TCI would automatically add on a $1 charge to their monthly bill, which would have then increased to $4.95 per month by May 1992. The negative option fee led to lawsuits filed against TCI by ten states, eventually causing the company to back away from utilizing the billing method for the channel. Many other cable providers were reluctant to offer Encore in its early years due to concerns that it would cannibalize subscriptions of other premium services. However, Sie positioned the channel as such that would bolster the growth of what had been a lagging pay television industry, as premium channels had been seeing a steady decline in subscribers overall since the late 1980s.\n\nAround the time of its launch, there was some debate as to whether Viacom or TCI originally conceived the idea for Encore; Viacom executives insisted that TCI lifted part of the idea from Viacom-owned Showtime Networks (which would launch a similarly formatted mini-pay service, Flix, in August 1992). In a 1991 interview with \"Multichannel News\", John Sie said that TCI brought up the Encore network concept as a way to revitalize Showtime, either by launching a new tertiary pay service from scratch, or overhauling the format of Showtime sister network The Movie Channel. Incidentally, TCI made a failed bid to acquire a 50% ownership stake in Showtime in 1989. Encore had increased its subscriber base to an estimated 7 million subscribers nationwide by 1996.\n\nOn January 1, 1997, Encore launched a new pay service called MoviePlex (originally named \"Encore Plex\" for its first few months on the air) which replaced a Liberty Media-owned network called INTRO Television, that ran blocks of programming from other cable channels. Until it adopted a separate film schedule on August 1, 2011, MoviePlex originally carried programming blocks from Encore's multiplex channels (which differed from that day's actual schedules for each channel to exclude R-rated movies) on a rotating day-to-day schedule. On June 2, 1997, TCI announced a deal in which it would transfer majority ownership of its Encore Media Group subsidiary to sister company Liberty Media, due in part to the significant profit losses incurred by Starz following that channel's launch – TCI retained a minority 20% ownership interest until its 1999 merger with AT&T Corporation, when Liberty Media assumed full ownership of the Encore Media Group. By May 1998, Encore had a subscriber base of 11.4 million homes with cable or satellite television.\n\nAs the channel aged, it adopted a more conventional presentation style: first in 1998, Encore began to carry two exclusive first-run feature film broadcasts each month, then Encore shifted its focus to hit movies as part of a major rebrand of the channel on May 24, 1999, primarily incorporating recent films, but with notable classics mixed in as well. By this point, Encore advertised itself as guaranteeing to air \"a great movie every night\", even setting up a special 1-800 number in which a $2.50 refund would be given to unsatisfied subscribers.\n\nEncore eventually began to be sold as a hybrid service, offered as either a premium channel or a digital basic network depending on the provider, retaining the uncut and commercial-free nature of its programming. Through this change in distribution, the channel was eventually available in 25 million homes nationwide by September 2005. On November 19, 2009, Liberty Media spun off Starz and Encore into a separate public tracking stock called Liberty Starz. On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Liberty Starz into its own separate, publicly traded company. The spin-off of the subsidiary was completed on January 11, 2013, with Liberty Starz changing its name to Starz Inc. as a result.\n\nOn April 5, 2016, Encore and its seven multiplex channels were rebranded as Starz Encore, unifying the network under the brand umbrella of the channel that Encore ironically spun off in September 1994. With the rebranding, Starz Encore also began to carry reruns of Starz original comedy and drama series within its schedule.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock; the acquisition was completed five months later on December 8.\n\nDepending on the service provider, Encore provides up to eighteen multiplex channels – nine 24-hour multiplex channels, eight of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Encore On Demand).\n\nEncore broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Encore channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.\n\nOn February 1, 1994, Encore launched the pay television industry's first \"themed\" multiplex – seven additional channels that each focused on a specific genre. This was initially going to be composed of six channels, but Encore decided to launch its own competitor to HBO and Showtime, called Starz!, after a May 1993 deal in which it acquired the pay television rights to run Universal Studios films released after that year. Starz was the first of the multiplex channels to launch, debuting on February 1, 1994. Three additional multiplex channels launched five months later on July 1, 1994: Love Stories, Mystery, and Westerns; these were followed on September 12, 1994 by the launch of the final three channels: True Stories & Drama (later shortened to True Stories), Action and WAM!: America's Youth Network (later known as WAM!: America's Kidz Network; it also went under the preliminary names \"Arcade\" and \"Tweens\" prior to the launch of the multiplex).\n\nEncore initially utilized a numbering system for each multiplex channel: Love Stories was designated as \"Encore 2\", Westerns was \"Encore 3\", Mystery was \"Encore 4\", Action was \"Encore 5\", True Stories was \"Encore 6\", WAM! was \"Encore 7\" and Starz! was designated \"Encore 8\". Encore eventually abandoned the numbering system for most of its channels in 1996, instead using the tagline \"an encore network\" from then on until the early 2002, in contrast, Starz! continued to use the \"Encore 8\" branding in its main IDs and feature presentation bumpers until 2002, even though that service had been long since separated entirely from the Encore brand by that time, and was given its own slate of multiplex channels.\n\nThe entire multiplex was rebranded to bring the individual channels back in line with the overall Encore brand on March 28, 2005, due to focus tests that revealed that viewers did not know the themed channels were directly related to the service's main channel. All of the multiplex channels had the \"Encore\" brand incorporated into the names of each channel, though three of the Encore multiplex channels underwent more extensive name changes: True Stories rebranded as Encore Drama, Love Stories became Encore Love and WAM!: America's Kidz Network became simply Encore Wam. Additional changes to the Encore multiplex came on August 1, 2011, with the launch of a Spanish-language simulcast of Encore's primary channel called Encore Español, and the respective rebrands and refocusings of Encore Mystery and the teen-targeted Encore Wam into Encore Suspense and Encore Family (the latter channel adopting a format similar to that of sister service Starz Kids & Family), Encore Westerns and Encore Action became the only Encore multiplex channels to retain the naming schemes that were in use since the multiplex's original 1994 launch (prior to the incorporation of the \"Encore\" name in the branding of the multiplex channels).\n\nThree of the Encore channels (two of them being among the channel's six original multiplex services) underwent changes in their programming formats on December 2, 2013 as part of an extensive rebranding of the Encore multiplex. Encore Drama relaunched as Encore Black (adopting the same target audience demographic – African Americans – as sister channel Starz's multiplex service Starz InBlack) and Encore Love was reformatted as Encore Classic (focusing primarily on classic feature films), both channels began incorporating reruns of network television series from the 1970s to the 1990s as part of specialized program blocks alongside feature films from that period. In addition, Encore Español, which originally sought carriage alongside the other multiplex channels, began to be made available as part of the Spanish-language channel tiers offered by most cable and satellite providers and adopted an independent schedule of Spanish-language feature films.\n\nThe multiplex has been given several collective brand names over the years, including the \"Encore Multiplex\", \"Encore Movie Networks\", \"Starz Encore Super Pak\", and \"Starz Super Pak\". As of 2014, the multiplex currently has no \"official\" marketed name, and viewers are simply told they are watching \"one of the seven Encore channels\", though some providers collectively brand the channels as the \"Encore Movie Pak\", while Dish Network uses the \"Starz Moviepack\" as an unofficial name for the entire collection of Starz and Encore channels and select other providers (such as DirecTV) continue to brand the channels as the \"Starz Super Pak\".\n\nStarz Encore HD is a high definition simulcast feed of Starz Encore that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. The main Encore channel originally launched its HD simulcast feed on March 22, 2003; it was shut down after the channel's March 2005 rebrand. The current incarnation of the HD simulcast feed was launched in July 2008. The main Encore HD simulcast is currently carried nationally by all major cable and satellite providers. Encore Action and Encore Drama (now Starz Encore Black) began broadcasting in high definition on August 1, 2011, while Encore Classic and Encore Suspense began their own HD simulcasts on December 2, 2013. It is currently unknown if or when Encore Westerns, Encore Family, and Encore Español will become available in high definition.\n\nStarz Encore operates a subscription video-on-demand television service called Starz Encore On Demand, which is available at no additional charge to new and existing Starz Encore subscribers. Encore On Demand offers program content available in standard or high definition, consisting of theatrically released feature films and original programs, to most cable and satellite providers. The service's rotating program selection incorporates select new titles that are added each Friday, alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.\n\nEncore Play was a website and mobile app that featured original programming and feature film content from Encore available for streaming in standard or high definition. It was available to Encore subscribers of Verizon FIOS, AT&T U-verse, Cox Communications, Xfinity by Comcast and DirecTV until it was merged with Starz.com on April 5, 2016.\n\nThe Encore Play iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch app was first released on October 8, 2012, followed by the release of the app for Android devices on May 7, 2013; an app for the Xbox 360 was released on December 3, 2013 (available for no extra charge to Xbox Live Gold members) and on the Xbox One on August 5, 2014. The Encore Play service, as well as Movieplex's TVEverywhere service Movieplex Play were merged into Starz's streaming app and website on April 5, 2016.\n\nFrom winter of 2015 to April 5, 2016, Encore's east coast linear feed along with much of its movie and TV series catalog had been offered as part of Starz's add-on subscription service, through Amazon Prime The cost was $8.99 per month (after a seven-day free trial) for Amazon Prime subscribers to access the Starz/Encore catalog and live feeds.\n\n, Encore – through Starz – maintains exclusive first-run film licensing agreements with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (since 1994; including content from subsidiaries Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, Disneynature, and Touchstone Pictures since 1997), Sony Pictures Entertainment (since January 2005; including content from subsidiaries Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, Screen Gems, Destination Films, Triumph Films and TriStar Pictures), Anchor Bay Entertainment, and Warren Miller Films (since 1997).\n\nThe first-run film output agreement with Walt Disney Pictures expired in December 2015, with the Netflix streaming service assuming the pay television rights since January 2016 (excluding films released by Touchstone Pictures, which were retained by Starz through a separate contract). The first-run film output agreement with Sony was renewed for nine years on February 11, 2013; the Warren Miller output deal was renewed for ten years on October 19, 2009.\n\nEncore also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have already received broadcast or syndicated television airings – of theatrical films from Warner Bros. Entertainment (including content from subsidiaries New Line Cinema, Turner Entertainment (both for films released prior to 2005), and Castle Rock Entertainment), Universal Studios (including content from subsidiaries Universal Animation Studios and Focus Features, all for films released prior to 2003), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (including content from subsidiaries United Artists, Orion Pictures, and The Samuel Goldwyn Company), Miramax Films (for films released prior to 2009), 20th Century Studios, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks Studios, Hollywood Pictures, Revolution Studios, Overture Films, Yari Film Group and the current network sister company Lions Gate Entertainment (since 2012).\n\nIn January 1997, Encore secured a licensing agreement with Paramount Pictures, broadcasting over 300 titles; Paramount's first contract with Encore expired in December 2005. In March 2013, Encore reassumed sub-run rights to Paramount Pictures' feature film releases. The first film broadcast through this deal was \"Primal Fear\". Additional Paramount Pictures releases were broadcast the following month on Encore, such as \"Racing with the Moon\", \"She's Having a Baby\" and \"Black Rain\". In April 2013, Encore acquired sub-run rights to feature films from DreamWorks Studios. The first film broadcast through this deal was \"In Dreams\".\n\nEncore generally airs older films released between the 1960s to the 1990s, with some newer movie titles (usually broadcast between six and nine months after their premiere on Starz) interspersed throughout the day (mostly on Sunday nights, as of the summer of 2014). The newly released films (previous aired on Starz) premiered on Sunday nights.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Encore (through Starz) had exclusive first-run movie rights with Universal Studios, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, Miramax, New Line Cinema and Carolco Pictures. Between 1995 and 2005, Encore broadcast films from Turner Pictures and New Line Cinema. Encore's contract with Universal Studios expired in late 2002; HBO and Starz shared half of Universal's films in 2003 before the former assumed pay television rights the following year.\n\nEncore aired its first ever slate of original programming in 2011: the miniseries \"Moby Dick\" and \"The Take\", and the biographical documentary \"Method to the Madness of Jerry Lewis\". The following year, Encore broadcast \"Thorne\" in June 2012.\n\nThe Big Miniseries Showcase (originally airing on weeknights, and later seen only on Sunday mornings) is a former weekly programming block that showcased a mix of classic and recent critically acclaimed miniseries. As part of this block, Encore broadcast original miniseries such as \"The Crimson Petal and the White\", \"\", \"Moby Dick\", \"Thorne\" (both of which were already broadcast previously) and \"Hindenburg: The Last Flight\". In addition to showcasing original miniseries, Encore has also aired older miniseries previously seen on network television such as \"The Thorn Birds\", \"North and South\", \"Shogun\", \"Jason and the Argonauts\" and \"Gulliver's Travels\". The block was discontinued on December 29, 2013.\n\nDespite being a premium service, Encore has incorporated acquired programming on several of its multiplex channels. Originally, these were limited to Encore Westerns and Encore Family (as WAM!/Encore Wam), consisting of classic western series from the 1950s to the 1970s on the former, and imported series aimed at children and teenagers on the latter channel (after Encore Wam stopped carrying acquired programming in 2009, sister channel Starz Kids & Family later incorporated some series programming onto its schedule that are aimed at the same target audience as those that were carried by Wam).\n\nCurrently, Starz Encore Westerns carries the classic western series \"Bonanza\", \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Have Gun – Will Travel\". Just prior to its rebranding as Encore Suspense, Encore Mystery eventually added acquired mystery series to its schedule (such as \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\"). With the 2013 rebranding and refocusing of what had been Encore Drama and Encore Love as Encore Black and Encore Classic, both channels added series fitting their respective formats in weekdaily blocks. Encore Black currently carries the classic African American sitcoms \"What's Happening!!\", \"Amen\", \"Diff'rent Strokes\" and \"227\"; while Encore Classic airs the classic sitcoms \"Murphy Brown\" and \"Night Court\"; and crime dramas \"Magnum, P.I.\" and \"The A-Team\". Encore Black began airing \"The Jeffersons\", \"Sanford and Son\", and \"Good Times\" on December 1, 2015. Starz Encore Family airs classic animated children's shows such as \"Garfield and Friends\" and various ex-DIC Entertainment shows like \"Heathcliff\", \"Inspector Gadget\", \"Liberty's Kids\", and \"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\".\n\nThroughout the network's history, Encore's logo has included a starburst mark. In the original logo used from 1991 to 1994, the starburst appeared within the \"O\" in the channel's name, which was rendered in uppercase and similar in design to sister network Starz's 2008 logo design – the mark was then revamped into a box design in 1994. The logo was simplified for the 1999 rebrand, removing the box design and turning the starburst into a line artwork above the \"encore\" logotype; the basic design was carried over in the 2005 revamp. On December 1, 2013, Encore introduced a new text-only logo, dropping the starburst mark included in its branding since its launch. In accordance with the rebrand, feature presentation bumpers were dropped across the Encore channels, with programs prefaced only by a graphic informing viewers of the program airing next.\n\n"}

The PNG government requested the Australian and New Zealand governments to provide a monitoring group to oversee the cease fire on the island. This group was made up of both civilian and defence personnel from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. Both sides of the conflict welcomed the group being on Bougainville. This support remained strong throughout the PMG's deployment. The PMG played a role in facilitating the peace process on 30 April 1998 and took over from the New Zealand Truce Monitoring Group which then departed.\n\nThe Bougainville Peace Agreement decreed that all personnel should be withdrawn from the island by December 2002. However, the group's presence was extended by the applicable governments and withdrew completely by 23 August 2003. A much smaller Bougainville Transition Team (with orange T-shirts) succeeded the PMG but has now also withdrawn. Australian police and civilian advisers have subsequently served on Bougainville as part of Australian government assistance to Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe PMG was unarmed and had no specific legal power (though it did have a mandate under the Lincoln Agreement). It remained definitively neutral at all times. In the early stages of its deployment, it acted primarily as a ceasefire monitoring group and spread information about developments in the peace process. Following the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the PMG focused primarily on facilitating the weapons disposal program, in co-operation with the small UN Observer Mission on Bougainville (UNOMB). There was also some logistical support given to the constitutional consultation and drafting process from 2003.\n\nSupport was provided to the group via use of the Loloho wharf on the eastern side of the island by naval vessels from Australia and New Zealand as well as the Kieta airfield by RNZAF C-130 Hercules and four RNZAF Bell UH-1 Iroquois. Additional helicopters were also UH-1 Iroquois supplied by the Australian Army, which were painted bright red for visibility, were utilised to ferry personnel to inland villages inaccessible by foot or vehicle. Later, air mobility was outsourced to Hevilift, which provided two Bell 212 helicopters. PMG Personnel wore bright yellow shirts and hats so that everyone on the island was aware of their presence.\n\nA Logistics Cell at Loloho also provided such services as catering, dental, medical, vehicle transport and communications to the outer lying sites such as Tonu and Wakunui.\n\n\n\n"}

He also did post-doctoral research in Philosophy of Science at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University and Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.\n\nJaki authored more than two dozen books on the relation between modern science and Christianity. He was Fremantle Lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford (1977), Hoyt Fellow at Yale University (1980) and Farmington Institute Lecturer at Oxford University (1988–1989). He was the Gifford Lecturer at Edinburgh University in 1974–1975 and 1975–1976. In 1987, he was awarded the Templeton Prize for furthering understanding of science and religion.\n\nHe was among the first to claim that Gödel's incompleteness theorem is relevant for theories of everything (TOE) in theoretical physics.

He has risen to fame as one of two lead guitarists in the Chicago-based jam band Umphrey's McGee. He is influenced by a wide range of styles and guitar players such as Joe Pass, Tommy Emmanuel, Chris Poland, Randy Rhoads, George Benson, David Gilmour, Frank Zappa, and Roy Buchanan among others.\n\nCinninger was raised in Niles, Michigan where he says his parents' extensive record collection influenced his eclectic tastes in music. Cinninger began playing in many bands by the age of 12, ranging in styles from jazz fusion to country music. After spending some time in the Berklee School of Music, he took classical guitar lessons from Gerry Zubko in Roseland, South Bend, Indiana. In 1997, he started his own band, Ali Baba's Tahini and regularly played shows alongside of another local band, Umphrey's McGee. Cinninger chose to learn his chops by playing with others rather than attend a college musical curriculum, as many of his friends did. Eventually, Ali Baba's Tahini disbanded in 2000 and Cinninger accepted an offer to join as a full-time member of Umphrey's McGee in 2000. His first show as a member of the band was on September 1, 2000.\n\nSince joining the band, he has, along with founder Brendan Bayliss, become one of the group's main songwriters.\n\nIn 2001, Cinninger released a self-titled solo album released on the Monkey Fuzz Records label. Several of its tracks developed into Umphrey's McGee songs, such as \"Blue Echo,\" \"Utopian Sky\" which became \"Utopian Fir,\" and \"Aster Heights\" which contained parts of \"Roulette\" and \"Last Man Swerving.\"\n\nIn 2004, five years after their initial split, Cinninger reformed Ali Baba's Tahini to record an album in the North Carolina mountains.\n\nJake uses a G&L Comanche, G&L S500, G&L ASAT, a G&L S500 deluxe, G&L Legacy, a Fender Stratocaster, a Babicz Identity Series Jumbo Cutaway Acoustic, and various custom Becker guitars. Jake's current touring rig consists mainly of an orange custom shop G&L Legacy, a red G&L commanche (used when power conditioning on stage requires noiseless pickups), and a custom made 7 string guitar. On tour these guitars are run into a custom schroeder amplification head for clean tones, and a custom OldField head for higher gain tones. He also uses an early '80s Marshall JCM 800, endorses Marshall Vintage Modern amps, OldField amps, and also uses Fuchs Audio Technology, and with Umphrey's McGee endorses Moog synthesizers, Morley effects pedals, Source Audio effect pedals and BBE Sound effects.\n\nJake also incorporates an unusual type of tremolo arm on his G&L guitar. The arm itself is a small piece of metal which is conformed to a specific shape. It is used as a palm rest to actuate the vibrato. This device is called the \"Jake Blade\" and was custom made.\n\nThe \"Jake Blade\" is now available on the Umphrey's Mcgee website in the merchandise section.\n\n\n"}

It is within the locality of Lake Eacham in the Tablelands Region local government area.\n\nLake Eacham (\"Yidyam\") was formed over 9,130 years ago when molten magma from the Earth's mantle rose to the surface and heated the water table. The steam that resulted from the boiling water was trapped underground, until massive explosions signalled its release. Huge cracks appeared in the ground and the trees that once lathed the mountainside were levelled and burnt. Eventually, after the eruptions, groundwater filled the crater and the trees grew back, creating the tranquil lake used today by families and tourists for recreation. There are no streams that flow into or out the lake, water is only lost through soakage and evaporation and only replenished through rainfall, the level can fluctuate up to 4 metres between wet and dry seasons. The nearby Lake Barrine formed in a similar way, over 17,300 years ago.\n\nThe local Ngadjon -jii (Aboriginal peoples), name the lake \"Wiinggina\" and tell a parallel, matching story of the Lakes origins, as follows\n\"\"Two young fellas were trying to spear that wallaby. But they missed and hit a flame tree. That’s a sacred tree. The young fellas not supposed to be out hunting. They weren’t initiated. Their elders told them to stay put, not go out hunting. But they didn’t listen. When they pulled their spear out, part of a grub came out with the spear, which was a witchetty grub. They started cutting down that tree to get more grubs. When they cut down that tree, the ground began to shake. Those two fellas had made Yamini (rainbow serpent) angry. Then the sky turned orange, then all these people back at the camp, the earth went from underneath them, sucked them in, whoosh, they all got drowned. Where they were camped became Bana Wiingina (Lake Eacham).\"\" (Warren Cannendo, Ngadjon-Jii)\nThis story, in all its local versions, is part of an indigenous oral history and mythology believed to be an oral record recalling those volcanic events more than 10,000 years old.\n\nBack in 1886, Lake Eacham (Yidyam) was included within original survey plans subdividing the whole of the Lake Eacham area into farming blocks. By 1888, however, the scenic value of the lake was recognised, and both the lake plus a narrow band of 'shoreline' rainforest were formally proclaimed \"scenic reserve\". For almost 50 years (1888–1936) the Lake was managed, used and enjoyed as a scenic reserve, with, at times, boats and boating; a guest house; speed boats; and watersking.\n\nIn 1934, the Queensland Government declared the lake and immediate surrounds be protected and managed as Lake Eacham National Park. In 1988, UNESCO declared the Wet Tropics of Queensland a World Heritage site with 14 areas protected, two of which were at Lake Barrine and at Lake Eacham. In 1994, the Queensland Government merged Lake Barrine National Park and Lake Eacham National Park to form Crater Lakes National Park.\n\nLake Eacham (\"Yidyam\") is isolated from any other watercourse (making it an enclosed catchment). How any fish arrived there to begin with is a mystery, but somehow, the Lake Eacham rainbowfish (\"Melanotaenia eachamensis\") found its way into the volcanic lake. Unfortunately for the small species, other larger fish were introduced into this closed system and eventually, these larger fish ate the Lake Eacham rainbowfish into extinction - at least as far as the lake was concerned.\n\nAquarists had been collecting the fish from the Lake Eacham National Park (illegally) and were very successful at breeding them. These private collections became the source stock to reintroduce the fish to the lake. However, the cause of the species' initial demise was still living in the lake and proceeded to deplete the entire population of reintroduced stock. Ichthyologists working in the rivers and streams of the Atherton Tableland have found the Lake Eacham rainbowfish in the Tully, Herbert and Johnstone Rivers and Dirran Creek.\n\nIn addition to the rainbowfish, Lake Eacham has two native fish species: The gudgeon \"Mogurnda adspersa\" and the hardyhead \"Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum\". Other fish in the lake are non-native human introductions.\n\nLake Eacham (\"Yidyam\") is the main feature of the 4.89 km² (1,210 acres) Crater Lakes National Park, with a dense rainforest and thousands of small animals. It is therefore a protected area under Queensland State legislation (\"Nature Conservation Act\" 1994), and, as such, the natural and cultural resources most closely associated with the lake are protected and managed by the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe lake has an average depth of 38 metres (125 ft) with a maximum depth of 65.5 metres (215 ft) and is considered by locals as being ideal for swimming, canoeing, bushwalking, and bird watching. No motor boats are allowed on the lake. It features a pontoon great for diving into the deep water. A large grassy area is set aside for recreation. There is a circuit walk around the lake that takes around 45 minutes to complete. There are also a population of turtles that can usually be seen just to the left of the pontoon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1912434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912434", "title": "Cedros Island", "text": "Cedros Island\n\nCedros Island (Isla de Cedros, \"island of cedars\" in Spanish) is an island in the Pacific Ocean belonging to the state of Baja California, Mexico. The dry and rocky island had a population of 1,350 in 2005 and has an area of which includes the area of several small nearby islands. Cedros Island is mountainous, reaching a maximum elevation of . The economy is based on commercial fishing and salt mining. Cedros has a distinctive flora and the traces of some of the earliest human beings in the New World. The ocean around the island is popular with sport fishermen.\n\nThere was human presence of the island already about 11,000 years ago. The American Indian inhabitants when the island was first visited by Spanish explorers in the 16th century called it Huamalgua, the \"Island of Fogs.\" The Indian inhabitants have been given the name Huamalgueños by modern day scholars. They were relocated to the mainland of Baja California by Jesuit missionaries in 1732 and ceased to exist as an identifiable people.\n\nCedros Island is located in Ensenada Municipality, off the west coast of the Mexican state of Baja California, from which it is separated by Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay. It is northwest of Punta Eugenia in Mulegé Municipality - the westernmost point of the state of Baja California Sur mainland. It also lies north of Isla Natividad (off Punta Eugenia, and also part of Mulegé Municipality) from which it is separated by the Canal de Keller, and some from San Diego. The island has an area of , being the fourth-largest island in Mexico (following Tiburón Island, Isla Ángel de la Guarda, and Cozumel).\n\nBetween Cedros Island and Isla Natividad runs the 28th parallel north, which defines the border between the Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. The Islas San Benito, about west and in area, are administratively part of Cedros Island.\n\nThe \"Isla de Cedros\" was named by early Spanish explorers who mistakenly associated the large amounts of redwood and cedar driftwood arriving with the California current for local pines visible on the crest of the island.\n\nCedros Island has a desert climate, BWh in the Köppen climate classification system and BWab (desert, hot summers, warm winters) in the Trewartha climate classification. Most precipitation occurs during the winter.\nThe only weather station on the island is located on the southeastern coast. The northern and western parts of the island are several degrees cooler because the cold waters surrounding the island cause heavy fog and clouds, especially during spring and summer. The condensation from the fog permits lusher vegetation to flourish, similar to the \"fog oases\" (lomas) of the arid Pacific Coast of South America. Precipitation is also greater at the higher elevations of the island, reaching possible annual totals of . Rarely, heavy rains caused by unstable tropical air masses and chubascos cause flooding.\n\nIt constitutes one of the 24 subdivisions (\"delegaciones\") of the municipio of Ensenada. The 2005 census showed a total population of 1,350 persons.\n\nThe borough \"seat\" is Cedros town (\"Pueblo Cedros\"), on the southern east coast. Pueblo Cedros is largely associated with \"Pescadores Nacionales de Abulón\", the lobster and abalone fishing cooperative based on the island. It was founded by fishermen in 1922.\n\nThe second town is Puerto Morro Redondo (in short, El Morro), close to the southeastern point of the island, El Morro. It is a \"company town,\" built by the joint Mexican Government and Mitsubishi Corporation to house the workers of the salt-transshipment facility on the island. Salt from the salt evaporation ponds of Guerrero Negro on the Baja California peninsula is taken by barge to a deepwater salt dock near Puerto Morro Redondo, at the south end of Cedros Island, where it is loaded onto ships for export. There is regularly scheduled air service to the island from Ensenada, departing every Monday and Wednesday, and landing at an airstrip at the south end, adjacent to the \"company town,\" while a road leads to \"Pueblo Cedros\". Open launch rides across the channel between Cedros and the mainland can also be arranged at the Abarrotes Ramales store in Bahia Tortugas, but travellers opting for this transport should be prepared to have a flexible schedule with several extra days in case of inclement weather conditions in the Channel.\n\nThe remaining settlements are smaller. Jerusalem is just west of El Morro, but on the western side of the airport, with regularly arranged residential units. It is frequently considered part of El Morro.\n\nLomas Blancas, a mining town with 17 buildings, is located between Cedros town and El Morro.\n\nSan Agustín, a typical fishing village with about 20 buildings, is located northeast of the southwestern point of the island, Cabo San Agustín.\n\nLa Colorada, on the southwest coast, with about 10 buildings, is north of San Agustín.\n\nWayle, 15 buildings on the western side of the southern bight \"Bahía del Sur\", is northeast of San Agustín.\n\nThe mining town of Punta Norte (about 25 buildings) is located on the northeast coast, southeast of the northern end of the island, which is also called Punta Norte. to the southeast is Los Crestones mine.\n\nList of settlements and locations:\n\nThe long-held theory that the first human beings in the Americas arrived by land through an ice-free corridor in western Canada has been called into question by archaeological discoveries along the Pacific coastlines of North and South America. Many scientists now believe that the earliest inhabitants arrived by boat, and findings on Cedros Island bolster that theory. The Clovis culture, which began about 11,200 BCE, is the earliest universally acknowledged evidence of man in the Americas; but the remains of ancient people dating to earlier than 10,000 BCE have been found on Cedros Island. Cedros Island was attractive to humans because of its rich marine environment and its relative abundance of water compared to most of the desert coastline of Baja California. The early people of Cedros Island fished, gathered shellfish, and hunted seals, sea lions, and seabirds. Ancient spear points and shell fishhooks found on Cedros are similar to those found in a semi-circle of the Pacific coastline from Okinawa to Peru. The fishhooks made of shell found on Cedros Island indicate a marine, sea-going culture some 6,000 years before similar cultures are known to have existed on the coast and islands of California.\n\nThe discovery of earliest fishhooks in the Americas was reported from Cedros Island in 2017. They date to about 11,000 B.P. The people making these fishhooks were fishing for deepwater species, which indicates that they were using boats.\n\nSimilar fishhooks have also been reported from Isla Espíritu Santo, also in Baja California.\n\nIn 1539, when the Spanish expedition led by Francisco de Ulloa landed on the island, it encountered several villages with populations at each estimated in the hundreds. Finding it difficult to reach the remaining Indians on the island, the Jesuit missionaries practiced Indian reductions and brought them all to Misión San Ignacio Kadakaamán, in San Ignacio on the Baja California mainland in 1732.\n\nHunters seeking seals and sea otters worked out the island between 1790 and 1850.\n\nGold and copper mining took place near Punta Norte between 1890 and 1917. The fishing village and cannery at Puerto Cedros were established in 1920. The fishing cooperative was founded in 1943, and the deepwater salt dock at the south end of the island was built in 1966. The island was mapped in detail by Mexican and U.S. geologists during the 1970s.\n\nCedros Island is at most some long in N-S direction and wide in the northern half; the southern end is some wide in a NW-SE direction. The island consists of a variety of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, including part of an ophiolite complex and high-pressure, low temperature blueschists. Most of the rocks are of Mesozoic age, though some late Cenozoic strata crop out near the town in the southeastern corner of the island. Its highest peak, Monte Cedros, has an elevation of .\n\nThe most common vegetation for more than 90 percent of the land on the island is desert scrub of many different species. The lower elevations, especially the south, receive very sparse rainfall. However, the northern and western parts of the island are often shrouded in fog, and some plants have adapted to receiving moisture from fog. The fog plus the slightly greater rainfall at higher elevations has permitted the existence of Monterey pine forests at elevations of to where the influence of the fog is most intense. The pine forests are scattered and only cover 0.46 percent of the total area of the island. The pines grow to a height of up to . California juniper are also found at similar altitudes, covering 0.05 percent of the land area.\n\nAt the highest elevations of the island, above and mixed in with the pine forests, chaparral vegetation is found. The chaparral averages in height and consists of several woody species including Quercus cedrosensis, the Cedar Island live oak. Chaparral covers 2.4 percent of the land area of Cedar Island.\n\nVargas or El Aguaje de Vargas is the most important spring with a flow of 180 drums of 200 lts or 55 US gal (208 l; 46 imp gal) every 12 hours; springs on the island are usually marked by groves of palm trees.\n\nLarge sea lion colonies are found on the rocks on the west side as well as the anchorage on the north end.\n\nThere are feral goats on Cedros. Unlike on other islands in the region (notably Guadalupe Island), they do not seem to have had a significant impact on the island ecosystem. This would be due to the fact that Cedros is on the continental shelf close to the coast and, at least temporarily, it was connected to the mainland during the last ice age when sea levels were lower than today. Then, and as a consequence of this, there are native to Cedros herbivores, which on one hand compete with the goat population for food and presumably have kept it from increasing beyond carrying capacity, and on the other hand forced the native plants to keep their defenses against herbivores, unlike plants on islands without megaherbivores which tend to lack those defenses.\n\nFish are abundant around Cedros Island. California yellowtail, a subspecies of yellowtail amberjack, are very plentiful at this island because of yellowtail breed there. These fish like to live in the kelp beds of the island. Other fish, such as calico bass and sheepshead are also very plentiful at this island.\n\nCedros Island is home to a number of taxa that are endemic to or occur in very few places outside the island. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The lake and surrounds are protected within the Crater Lakes National Park and are accessible via the Gillies Highway.\n\nLake Barrine was formed over 17,000 years ago when a large volcano erupted, leaving a crater that over time filled up with water to create a lake. The crater or maar was formed as a result of a series of volcanic explosions. These explosions were caused by the hot molten rock coming into contact with groundwater. This caused a build-up of steam, gases and pressure which blasted the central core from the volcano. This massive explosion left a huge crater, which filled with rainwater to create Lake Barrine. Local Aboriginals called the lake Barany.\n\nThe largest of the natural volcanic lakes in the area, Lake Barrine is 730 m above sea level. It is about 1 km in diameter, with a shoreline of almost 4.5 km, an average depth of 35 m and a maximum depth of 65 m. No streams or springs feed the crystal clear lake; it is filled only by rainwater. During the wet season a small creek flows out of the lake. It joins Toohey Creek which is a tributary of the Mulgrave River.\n\nThere are walking tracks around the lake and tour operators offer cruises on the lake. Facilities at the lake include picnic grounds, a kiosk and a pre-war tea house which was built in 1926. Visitors may also swim in the lake and partake in birdwatching. Camping and domestic animals are prohibited near the lake.\n\nThe surrounding rainforest contains giant kauri (\"Agathis microstachya\"), red cedar (\"Toona ciliata\") and flowering umbrella trees (\"Schefflera actinophylla\"). Wildlife common in the area include eastern water dragons, giant eels, saw-shelled turtles, scrub pythons (\"Morelia kinghorni\"), pied cormorants, black ducks, plumed whistling ducks, black coot, whistling kites, brahminy kites, black kites, white-breasted sea eagles and dusky moorhens.\n\nDuring World War II the teahouse was used by the Australian Army as a convalescent home.\n\n"}

It is an Aboriginal community about by road from Cairns CBD on Cape Grafton. It is much closer by direct-line distance but is separated from Cairns CBD by the Murray Prior Range and Trinity Inlet, an inlet of the Coral Sea. At the , Yarrabah had a population of 2,559.\n\nGunggay (also known as Gunggandji, Kongandji, Kongkandji, Gungganyji, Idindji and Yidiny) is an Aboriginal language of Far North Queensland. The Gunggay language region of Cape Grafton includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cairns Regional Council and Yarrabah Community Council.\n\nAn Anglican church missionary, Ernest Gribble (1868–1957) in 1892 began to regularly visit an Aboriginal group who inhabited the Yarrabah area living a very traditional lifestyle. These visits by Gribble were to encourage the tribe to move to a mission settlement he was setting up. With the help of the tribe's leader, Menmuny, the tribe moved to the mission now known as Yarrabah Community. The mission was settled in 1893. Over time, many people (including some South Sea Islanders) were relocated from homelands in the surrounding area to Yarrabah.\n\nYarrabah State School was opened on 1 January 1892. In 2017, Yarrabah State School celebrated its 125th anniversary.\n\nIn 1957, the Yarrabah residents staged a strike to protest poor working conditions, inadequate food, health problems and harsh administration. The church expelled the ringleaders and many others left voluntarily, never to return. A few years later, the Government of Queensland assumed control of the mission. As a result, still today most of Yarrabah is Crown Land. Native Title claims here are hard to put forward, due to the very fragmented ethnic composition of this community, with many Aboriginal people in Yarrabah having been settled here from other areas, including interstate.\n\nIn 1965, an advisory council was set up which allowed Aboriginal people to give \"advice\" to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but it had no actual power and the government continued to control all aspects of local people's lives. In 1979, several community members joined a union but were stood down.\n\nEventually, on 27 October 1986, the community received Deed of Grant in Trust land tenure, making it subject to the \"Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984\", which allowed for self-governing Aboriginal Community Councils with a range of powers and controls over the land. With the passage of reforms in 2005, the Council became an \"Aboriginal Shire\" and gained the authority of a legal local government.\n\nFollowing the 2001 Cape York Justice Study findings, Yarrabah became one of many indigenous communities in Queensland to be subject to an alcohol management plan. Restrictions on alcohol possession commenced on 6 February 2004, with a review by 2006. A 2012 survey for another review showed the community was divided on easing restrictions. \n\nOn 23 July 2007, Yarrabah hosted the Cabinet of the Queensland Government in the first ever Cabinet meeting to be held in an indigenous Australian community.\nOn 1 October 2007, the Howard Coalition Government chose Yarrabah as the first recipient of what was said to be a 'landmark housing and welfare reform agreement'.\n\nThe population of community was given to be about 630 indigenous persons in 1952. \n\nAccording to the 2016 Census the town had a population of 2,559 people. However, note that official estimates of population may be undercounts due to both language barriers and the transient nature of residence of the outstations.\n\nOf those, 97.4% identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The median age of Yarrabah residents was 23, compared with 38 nationally. The majority of the Yarrabah workforce was engaged as either labourers or as community and personal service workers, and worked in local government administration or social assistance services. The median individual income was $224 per week compared with $534 per week for the Cairns statistical district.\n\n84.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Kriol at 6.7%. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 84.6% and No Religion 7.4%.\n\nThe Yarrabah community has a state pre-school, primary school and high school, which extends to Year 10 only. The nearest school for students continuing on to senior years (Year 11–12) is located in Gordonvale. Pupils who attend the Gordonvale High School commute to and from it with a free-of-charge school bus, which is the only public transport available for Yarrabah residents. A few decades back a ferry service used to take pupils to and from school in Cairns, before the road to Yarrabah was sealed. This service is no longer in use.\n\nThe Yarrabah community has a public library which serves a number of purposes including access to computers and the Internet, equipment to watch movies on DVD, and educational links including a Homework Centre (a Federal Government initiative) and access to the RATEP (Aboriginal Teacher Education Program) at James Cook University in Townsville for those training to be teachers.\n\nThe Yarrabah community has its own newsletter entitled \"Yarrabah News\", published monthly since the late 1970s.\n\nYarrabah has one small supermarket run by local people, two hot food take-away shops, a local bakery and a drive-in pub, as well as a service station. For most other commercial needs, people need to travel to Gordonvale, Edmonton or Cairns. The road to the community is bitumen sealed and is accessible all year round despite weather conditions.\n\nErgon Energy powers the station and the residences. Ergon Energy power lines power the whole community as far as the Oombunji suburb (5-10 kilometres from the Community). Residents who live further than Oombunji and other places/suburbs in Yarrabah such as Wungu ('sounds of corroboree dance'), Back Beach, Buddabaddoo, King Beach, Turtle Bay and Jilji have to use power generators for electricity. People who live in these outer places/suburbs can also adapt to live without power. The area is subjected to power blackouts especially during the wet season. During the blackouts there are no cooking facilities. Some blackouts have been known to last up to five days.\n\nYarrabah's medical needs are serviced by a multi-disciplinary primary health care centre, which handles emergencies and general practice care, but does not have inpatient facilities. It is staffed 24 hours a day by staff who mostly commute from Cairns.\n\nA police station and a police citizens youth club are also within the township. Issues of concern include violence, alcohol/substance abuse, domestic violence, and high unemployment. Previously youth suicide was higher than surrounding areas.\n\nThe township has had a brass band since 1901 to the 1950s, until resurrected in 2013, making their debut at the inaugural Yarrabah Band Festival. The festival itself is now held annually around October, drawing a crowd of about 4000 persons. \n\nYarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council operates an Indigenous Knowledge Centre library service located at Lot 207 Noble Drive which opened in 2015. The $1.9 million facility was built both for and by the people of Yarrabah, offering learning opportunities even during its construction. Funding for the Centre was secured in 2012 by Treasurer and Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships Curtis Pitt, who officially opened the Yarrabah Knowledge Centre on 19 November. Leeanne Enoch, Minister for Science and Innovation, was also in attendance. \n\nThe Yarrabah Menmuny Museum, opened in 1996, is located in the Jilji suburb. The museum's name comes the local tribe leader of the late 1800s, Menmuny, who was also given the title 'King John' Menmuny, who died circa 1919. A later elder was 'King' Albert Maywee. \n\nYarrabah used to be serviced by the Paradise Bus, which is based in Babinda and privately run. As of 2016 this bus service only provides a regular service along the Bruce Highway, about 30 km from Yarrabah, which joins the community of Gordonvale (south of Cairns), with the suburb of Edmonton and the Cairns CBD.\n\nA ferry service used to be in place at Yarrabah, back in the days when there were no sealed roads to reach Cairns. Locals used to call this ferry a 'flatty'. It used to carry school children back and forth from Yarrabah to the city of Cairns. A project to build a new wharf at Yarrabah is in place, after the Queensland Government allocated 7 million dollars to this purpose. It is expected when this new wharf becomes operational, regular and reliable water transport will be resumed for Yarrabah, which lies only 11 kilometres by sea from the Cairns waterfront. \n\nYouth can be occasionally riding some of the brumbies of the area, without saddles. \n\n"}

The Figge, as it is commonly known, has an encyclopedic collection and serves as the major art museum for the eastern Iowa and western Illinois region. The Figge works closely with several regional universities and colleges (see below) as an art resource and collections hub for a number of higher education programs.\n\nThe museum opened on August 6, 2005, and is the renamed successor to the Davenport Museum of Art, which was opened on October 10, 1928, as the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery. The museum has its roots in the Davenport Art Association, which was founded before February 23, 1878, and was re-located on November 15, 1889, to the Bianca Wheeler art studio. The Figge Art Museum is one of the oldest art institutions in the country and is considered the first municipal art gallery in the United States. The Figge won an AIA award.\n\nThe new building was designed by Stirling Prize-winning Modernist British architect David Chipperfield. It was Chipperfield's first architectural commission in the United States. The Figge Art Museum gets its name from the V.O. and Elizabeth Kahl Figge Foundation, which donated $13 million towards its $47 million construction. The Figge family, a local banking family of Swiss origin, has a long tradition of philanthropy and cultural enrichment.\n\nThe first pieces of its collections were donated by Davenport community leader Charles Ficke (1850–1931), a successful lawyer and former mayor, who collected art from around the world. Robert E. Harsche, then Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, reported that to his knowledge no American public art gallery had \"started out with so large a number of important paintings as a nucleus.\"\n\nThe museum has over 4,000 works of art, ranging from the 16th century to the present, and is best known for its extensive collection of Haitian, Colonial Mexican and Midwestern art, particularly pieces by Thomas Hart Benton, Marvin Cone and Grant Wood, including the only self-portrait Wood ever painted. In 1990, Grant Wood's estate, which included his personal effects and various works of art, became the property of the Figge Art Museum through his sister Nan Wood Graham, the woman portrayed in American Gothic.\n\nThe institution also houses a substantial American collection (including works by Albert Bierstadt, James McNeill Whistler, William Merritt Chase, Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth, Ansel Adams, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns), European art (including work by artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt, Claude Lorrain, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Henry Raeburn, Toulouse-Lautrec and Pierre-Auguste Renoir), and works from East Asia (with pieces by Hokusai, Hiroshige and Kunisada). As owners of Grant Wood's estate, the museum is also home to the Grant Wood Archives, and received substantial support from The Henry Luce Foundation for the conservation of these archives.\n\nThe museum exhibits an important collection of pieces by Frank Lloyd Wright, the American architect and designer from the Midwest.\n\nIts inaugural exhibition, \"The Great American Thing: 1915-1935\" opened September 17, 2005, and featured major works from early American Modernists.\n\nThe Figge Art Museum currently houses the University of Iowa Museum of Art collection, after the University of Iowa's gallery was flooded in 2008. The collection, which totals over 12,000 works, includes significant paintings by American artists such as Jackson Pollock, Stuart Davis, Richard Diebenkorn, Peter Golfinopoulos, Sam Gilliam, Adolph Gottlieb, Joan Mitchell, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt, and Marsden Hartley, as well as European artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Max Beckmann, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Giorgio de Chirico, Lyonel Feininger, Juan Gris, Alexej von Jawlensky, Fernand Léger, Joan Miró, Giorgio Morandi, and Chaim Soutine. The collection also contains significant pieces from sub-Saharan Africa, Pre-Columbian art, a significant collection of European and American prints and drawings, as well as many other areas of the world.\n\nThe Figge Art Museum is home to Western Illinois University's graduate program in Museum Studies, which offers a Master of Arts degree in the various aspects of museum management, such as curatorial design, museum administration and finance, art education, collections management, and marketing/PR.\n\nThe museum is 115,000 square feet (10,683 m²) and has been accredited by the American Alliance of Museums since 1973.\n"}

It was founded by Guy de Montpellier in Provence for the care of the sick by groups of lay people. Pope Innocent III recognised it ca 1161–June 16, 1216. It was originally based in the Santo Spirito in Sassia in Rome. A small female remnant survives in Poland.\n\nThe order was responsible for running hospitals - known as Hospitals of the Holy Ghost - throughout Europe for centuries. At its prime, they numbered many hundreds. The wealth of its endowments made it a repeated target for the unscrupulous. The lay Knights of the Holy Ghost formed on analogy to military orders, but without military function, repeatedly attempted to divert the group's assets to their own use. Several popes made efforts to protect the order as a purely religious body, but Pope Pius V in 1619 re-created the Knights and again diverted the Order's assets into their hands. In 1692 Louis XIV redirected the property in the possession of the Knights for the benefit of his own Order of Our Lady of Carmel, in effect a pension fund for his retired soldiers. \n\nThe remaining religious members of the order were successful in obtaining an edict in 1700 which again confirmed the purely religious nature of the order and regaining the use of the funds for religious and charitable purposes. These now focused on a single institution, the original and by this time large \"Arcispedale di Santo Spirito\" in Sassia, the buildings of which dated from the time of Pope Sixtus IV (1471–84), which at its height was capable of accommodating over 1,000 patients, with additional spaces for contagious and for dangerously insane cases, employing more than 100 medical staff with an international remit. \n\nOver time it became a municipal hospital for the inhabitants of Rome and later became a museum and conference center. The Order in Rome gradually merged into the medical profession, though offshoots of the order survived into the 20th century in France.\n\nThe order was abolished in 1783.\n"}
{"id": "1912480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912480", "title": "Ellsberg paradox", "text": "Ellsberg paradox\n\nThe Ellsberg paradox is a paradox in decision theory in which people's choices violate the postulates of subjective expected utility. It is generally taken to be evidence for ambiguity aversion. The paradox was popularized by Daniel Ellsberg, although a version of it was noted considerably earlier by John Maynard Keynes.\n\nThe basic idea is that people overwhelmingly prefer taking on risk in situations where they know specific odds rather than an alternative risk scenario in which the odds are completely ambiguous—they will always choose a known probability of winning over an unknown probability of winning even if the known probability is low and the unknown probability could be a guarantee of winning. For example, given a choice of risks to take (such as bets), people \"prefer the devil they know\" rather than assuming a risk where odds are difficult or impossible to calculate.\n\nEllsberg proposed two separate thought experiments, the proposed choices of which contradict subjective expected utility. The 2-color problem involves bets on two urns, both of which contain balls of two different colors. The 3-color problem, described below, involves bets on a single urn, which contains balls of three different colors.\n\nConsider an urn containing 30 red balls and 60 other balls that are either black or yellow. It is unknown how many black or how many yellow balls there are, but that the total number of black balls plus the total number of yellow equals 60. The balls are well mixed so that each individual ball is as likely to be drawn as any other. Given a choice between two gambles:\n\nAlso you are given the choice between these two gambles (about a different draw from the same urn):\n\nThis situation poses both \"Knightian uncertainty\" – how many of the non-red balls are yellow and how many are black, which is not quantified – and \"probability\" – whether the ball is red or non-red, which is vs. .\n\nUtility theory models the choice by assuming that in choosing between these gambles, people assume a \"probability\" that the non-red balls are yellow versus black, and then compute the \"expected utility\" of the two gambles.\n\nSince the prizes are the same, it follows that you will \"prefer\" Gamble A to Gamble B if and only if you believe that drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball (according to expected utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will \"prefer\" Gamble C to Gamble D \"if, and only if\", you believe that drawing a red or yellow ball is more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball, then drawing a red or yellow ball is also more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. So, supposing you \"prefer\" Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also \"prefer\" Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you \"prefer\" Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also \"prefer\" Gamble D to Gamble C.\n\nWhen surveyed, however, most people \"strictly prefer\" Gamble A to Gamble B and Gamble D to Gamble C. Therefore, some assumptions of the expected utility theory are violated.\n\nMathematically, the estimated probabilities of each color ball can be represented as: \"R\", \"Y\", and \"B\". If you \"strictly prefer\" Gamble A to Gamble B, by utility theory, it is presumed this preference is reflected by the expected utilities of the two gambles: specifically, it must be the case that\n\nwhere \"U\"( ) is your utility function. If \"U\"($100) > \"U\"($0) (you strictly prefer $100 to nothing), this simplifies to:\n\nIf you also strictly prefer Gamble D to Gamble C, the following inequality is similarly obtained:\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nThis contradiction indicates that your preferences are inconsistent with expected-utility theory.\n\nThe result holds regardless of your utility function. Indeed, the amount of the payoff is likewise irrelevant. Whichever gamble is selected, the prize for winning it is the same, and the cost of losing it is the same (no cost), so ultimately, there are only two outcomes: receive a specific amount of money, or receive nothing. Therefore, it is sufficient to assume that the preference is to receive some money to nothing (and, this assumption is not necessary: in the mathematical treatment above, it was assumed \"U\"($100) > \"U\"($0), but a contradiction can still be obtained for \"U\"($100) < \"U\"($0) and for \"U\"($100) = \"U\"($0)).\n\nIn addition, the result holds regardless of your risk aversion. All the gambles involve risk. By choosing Gamble D, you have a 1 in 3 chance of receiving nothing, and by choosing Gamble A, you have a 2 in 3 chance of receiving nothing. If Gamble A was less risky than Gamble B, it would follow that Gamble C was less risky than Gamble D (and vice versa), so, risk is not averted in this way.\n\nHowever, because the exact chances of winning are known for Gambles A and D, and not known for Gambles B and C, this can be taken as evidence for some sort of ambiguity aversion which cannot be accounted for in expected utility theory. It has been demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs only when the choice set permits comparison of the ambiguous proposition with a less vague proposition (but not when ambiguous propositions are evaluated in isolation).\n\nThere have been various attempts to provide decision-theoretic explanations of Ellsberg's observation. Since the probabilistic information available to the decision-maker is incomplete, these attempts sometimes focus on quantifying the non-probabilistic ambiguity which the decision-maker faces – see Knightian uncertainty. That is, these alternative approaches sometimes suppose that the agent formulates a subjective (though not necessarily Bayesian) probability for possible outcomes.\n\nOne such attempt is based on info-gap decision theory. The agent is told precise probabilities of some outcomes, though the practical meaning of the probability numbers is not entirely clear. For instance, in the gambles discussed above, the probability of a red ball is , which is a precise number. Nonetheless, the agent may not distinguish, intuitively, between this and, say, . No probability information whatsoever is provided regarding other outcomes, so the agent has very unclear subjective impressions of these probabilities.\n\nIn light of the ambiguity in the probabilities of the outcomes, the agent is unable to evaluate a precise expected utility. Consequently, a choice based on \"maximizing\" the expected utility is also impossible. The info-gap approach supposes that the agent implicitly formulates info-gap models for the subjectively uncertain probabilities. The agent then tries to satisfice the expected utility and to maximize the robustness against uncertainty in the imprecise probabilities. This robust-satisficing approach can be developed explicitly to show that the choices of decision-makers should display precisely the preference reversal which Ellsberg observed.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that this type of game triggers a deceit aversion mechanism. Many humans naturally assume in real-world situations that if they are not told the probability of a certain event, it is to deceive them. People make the same decisions in the experiment that they would about related but not identical real-life problems where the experimenter would be likely to be a deceiver acting against the subject's interests. When faced with the choice between a red ball and a black ball, the probability of is compared to the \"lower part\" of the – range (the probability of getting a black ball). The average person expects there to be fewer black balls than yellow balls because in most real-world situations, it would be to the advantage of the experimenter to put fewer black balls in the urn when offering such a gamble. On the other hand, when offered a choice between red and yellow balls and black and yellow balls, people assume that there must be fewer than 30 yellow balls as would be necessary to deceive them. When making the decision, it is quite possible that people simply forget to consider that the experimenter does not have a chance to modify the contents of the urn in between the draws. In real-life situations, even if the urn is not to be modified, people would be afraid of being deceived on that front as well.\n\nA modification of utility theory to incorporate uncertainty as distinct from risk is Choquet expected utility, which also proposes a solution to the paradox.\n\nOther alternative explanations include the competence hypothesis and comparative ignorance hypothesis. These theories attribute the source of the ambiguity aversion to the participant's pre-existing knowledge.\n\n\n"}

In 2009, Albany won its regional National Science Bowl competition, placing fifth nationwide.\n\nIn 2012, the school National Ocean Sciences Bowl team went to Baltimore for Nationals, where they took seventh place. In 2013, the National Ocean Sciences Bowl team went to Milwaukee for Nationals and took fifth place. In 2016, Albany went to North Carolina for Nationals, where it won first place in the 2016 Department of Commerce National Ocean Sciences Bowl competition. In 2018, Albany won the regional NOSB competition, and placed fourth overall in the national finals in Colorado later that year.\n\nAthletic teams of Albany High School belong to the Tri Counties Athletic League (TCAL) in the North Coast Section (NCS) of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), which manages all high school sports teams in California. Fall sports include football, girls' and boys' cross country, girls' volleyball, girls' golf, and girls' tennis. Sports offered during the winter are girls' and boys' soccer, girls' and boys' basketball, and girls' and boys' wrestling. Sports teams offered during the spring include softball, baseball, girls' and boys' track and field, girls' and boys' swimming, boys' golf, and boys' tennis.\n\nAlbany High's soccer team was successful in 2010, with the varsity boys' and girls' teams going undefeated in the winter season of 2010. The girls' volleyball team went to the Northern California State Championships in 2011, but lost. In February 2014, the girls' wrestling team took first place at the CIF State tournament.\n\nIn 1997, Albany High School's main building and gymnasium, both completed in 1934, were deemed to be seismically unsound. They were demolished, and construction began on a new campus. During the four years of construction, between 1997 and 2001, classes were held in portable trailers. The new school building and gymnasium opened in 2001.\n\nDuring the 2004-2005 school year, several security cameras were installed in the building to prevent vandalism.\n\nIn 2004, the school suffered overcrowding due to an overly large freshman class. The large influx of students was caused in part by an Albany Unified School District policy, which allowed students from other cities such as El Cerrito and Richmond to enter Albany schools.\n\nThe school mascot is the cougar and the school colors are red and white.\n\nThe current principal as of the 2017-2018 school year is Alexa Ritchie, who was formerly the principal of Marin Elementary School in the same school district.\n\nAlbany participates in many local competitions, including NAQT, NOSB's Otter Bowl (which they won in 2006 and took fourth in nationwide), and the National Science Bowl, in which they also took fourth place nationwide.\n\nThe school hosts a well-established Model United Nations program. In the 2010-2011 academic year, Albany became home to a forensic (Speech and Debate) team. The Albany High Speech and Debate team is a member of the Golden Gate Speech Association and the National Forensic League. Both programs are established in club format; while other local schools have classes dedicated solely to Model UN and debate, Albany runs both programs as student clubs.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, four Albany High students filed suit against the school arguing that they had been punished unfairly for their involvement with racist harassment on Instagram. The students and their lawyers claimed that the school had violated their First Amendment rights by punishing them for actions that took place outside of school grounds and outside of school hours. The complaints also stated that the students were refused protection by Jeff Anderson as a growing body of students gathered outside of the office where they were meeting for a restorative justice session. As the four students attempted to leave through their peers, two of the students were struck in the head by an enraged demonstrator, while others hid in a locked vehicle for safety, prompting complaints that the school mishandled the situation and allowed an unruly assembly to take place. Many teachers did not take attendance or mark students as absent for attending the unsanctioned assembly. In the interim between the original incident and the lawsuit, principal Jeff Anderson was reassigned within the district, and former principal Ron Rosenbaum took over as interim principal for the remainder of the school year.\n\nOn May 26, Judge James Donato granted an order to halt the expulsion hearing for plaintiff Kevin Chen, which was scheduled for June 1 of that year. The ruling stated, \"The Court is also advised that Chen is a rising senior about to start the college admissions process, and being wrongly expelled would likely cause irreparable harm to his admission prospects.\" \n\nAlbany High changed from a 7-period per day schedule to a block schedule during the 2005–2006 school year. Instead of having seven 57-minute periods per day, the new block schedule consists of two blocks, A and B. Block A, on Tuesday and Thursday, has 94-minute periods for periods 1, 3, 5***, and 7. Block B, on Wednesday and Friday, has 94-minute periods for periods 2, 4, and 6 with an added 40-minute Advisory period between 2nd and 4th period. On Monday, all classes last for 51 minutes. The first class always begins at 8:10 am, except on finals week.\n\nThe entire city of Albany is zoned to this school. The University Village development, a student housing complex of the University of California Berkeley which houses families, is assigned to this school.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1481 he ordered an invasion to the city of Zahara de la Sierra by surprise, killing and enslaving the unarmed Christian Zaharans. This action was taken by Isabella I of Castile as a reason to start the war against Granada.\n\nHe was the father of Muhammad XII (also known as \"Boabdil\"), the last sultan of Granada, by his relative Aixa. He took a captive Christian slave named Isabel de Solís and fell in love with her, renamed after her conversion as his second wife Zoraida or Soraya (Thuraya, \"Star\"), the daughter of Sancho Jiménez de Solís, \"Alcalde\" of La Peña de Martos, he had two sons. There are no other biographical elements on Zoraya: She could have joined him in his exile with her two sons. It seems that after the death of Abu'l-Hasan, Zoraya and her two sons re-converted to Catholicism.

From 2006 when it lost its regional accreditation to 2017 when it regained that accreditation, it operated as a part of El Camino College. Prior to and subsequent to the partnership with El Camino College, the college was operated by the Compton Community College District.\n\nCompton Community College was established in 1927 as a component of the Compton Union High School District. From 1932 to 1949, it operated as a four-year junior college, incorporating the last two years of high school as well as the first two years of college.\n\nIn 1933 the campus was devastated by a major earthquake which struck the region, leaving two buildings standing. Nobody on campus was killed.\n\nIn the 1940s several thousand Compton College students entered the armed forces and during World War II the campus housed a military unit and a defense plant.\n\nIn 1950 voters approved a bond issue separating the college from the high school district. The new college campus was then constructed at the college's present site, 1111 East Artesia Boulevard. Classes began on the new campus in the Fall of 1953.\n\nIn the 1960s the composition of the student body changed dramatically from predominantly Caucasian to overwhelmingly African-American. As a result, it has sometimes been called \"California’s historically black college.\"\n\nIn 1970 the Board of Trustees appointed the institution's first African-American President/Superintendent, Dr. Abel B. Sykes, Jr. Highlights during his 14-year administration included the construction of the first two new campus buildings since 1952: the Jane Astredo Allied Health Building and the Abel B. Sykes, Jr. Child Development Center (named after him in 1995).\n\nThe 1980s was a period of reduced funding and partial retrenchment for the institution, but by the early 1990s the college had once again stabilized. The second major demographic shift occurred in the 1990s, making the campus population 46% African-American and 46% Hispanic (3% White, Non-Hispanic; 3% APISA; 2% Other).\n\nIn 1996 the Board appointed Ulis C. Williams as Interim President/Superintendent and in January, 1997 made this appointment permanent.\n\nIn 2004 the college began experiencing significant turmoil caused by a \"corrupt board and financial insolvency\". \nIn May 2004, the state installed Arthur Tyler, Jr. as Special Trustee to assist the Compton Community College District toward achieving fiscal stability and integrity. Subsequently, in August, the State Chancellor issued another Executive Order (2004-02) authorizing the continuing authority of the Special Trustee to manage the College, and to suspend, for up to one year, the powers of the governing board of the College, or of any members of that board, and to exercise any powers or responsibilities or to take any official action with respect to the management of the College. Interim President/Superintendent, Dr. Rita Cepeda was hired in February, 2005 to assist with the recovery of the College.\n\nThe following year, the Executive Director of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC), Dr. Barbara Beno informed the College of the Commission's decision to terminate the College's accreditation. In July, 2005, the State Chancellor assigned Dr. Jamillah Moore, Senior Vice Chancellor of the California Community Colleges system as the interim President/Superintendent and Dr. Charles Ratliff as the Special Trustee with the impending departure of both Dr. Cepeda and Mr. Tyler. The College began its appeal to the Commission regarding the termination decision.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, a third Special Trustee, Mr. Thomas Henry, was assigned to the College District to continue with the implementation of AB 61 and the development of AB 318 to keep the doors open for students. On June 30, 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 318 (D-Dymally) into law giving the College District $30 million loan for recovery and the opportunity to partner with a college of good standing to offer accredited courses. The bill also gave the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) the responsibilities to conduct a comprehensive assessment and to develop a recovery plan for the College to regain its accreditation.\n\nFive months later, the Special Trustee approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with El Camino College District to solidify the partnerships between the two districts. Under this MOU, the campus became a center of El Camino College. The Office of the President/Superintendent was replaced by the Office of Provost/Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The center is officially established as the Compton Community Educational Center. At midnight, Compton Community College lost its accreditation. Shortly thereafter, the Compton Community Educational Center officially became part of El Camino College with Dr. Doris P. Givens serving as the Provost/CEO. Dr. Lawrence M. Cox became Provost/CEO from 2008 to 2010.\n\nOn June 7, 2017, Compton College was restored to full accreditation. This followed years of rebuilding under president Keith Curry who was provost of the campus while it was partnered with El Camino College.\n\nThe library on campus opened in 2014. Its opening was originally scheduled for 2007. At that time it had a cost of $25 million. The opening was delayed by almost seven years and with an additional $4 million spent due to violations in the building code. For the period it was highly renovated.\n\n\n"}

The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier.

The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977–1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers.\n\nThe ship was ordered as part of a group of eight ships in Fiscal Year 1966. The LST was laid down on 13 April 1968 at San Diego, California, by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company.

And then in 1830, he was with Phillip Parker King on board HMS \"Adventure\" while it surveyed the Straits of Magellan at the tip of South America.\n\nBy 1830, the 1821–1829 Greek War of Independence had ended and the United Kingdom found itself in a 'peace keeping' role about Greece in the Mediterranean once the fighting stopped. Owen Stanley found himself in the middle of these efforts. By 1831, he served as mate on board the Royal Navy's and then with Captain John Franklin on both in the Mediterranean in 1831.\n\nIn 1831, he received promotion to lieutenant and continued to serve in Grecian waters until 1836 on a number of ships. He served on in 1831; in 1831–1832, he served on ; he was aboard in 1832–1834, and finished his 'Greece Assignment' on board in 1834–1836, during which time he spent eighty-four days surveying the Gulf of Corinth in a small boat, which he ended up hauling over the Isthmus to rejoin Mastiff.\n\nIn 1836, with his Mediterranean service now over, he sailed to the Arctic as scientific officer on under George Back. In 1838 he was given command of and sailed to Australia and New Zealand, returning in 1843. While on the 'high seas' two things of some note happened to him: (1) On 26 March 1839, he was promoted to commander; (2) In March 1842, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society \n\nIn 1843–1846 he was assigned shore duty. During that time, on 23 September 1844, he was promoted to captain at the age of 33.\n\nIn December 1846 Stanley sailed from Portsmouth in charge of , with the naturalists Thomas Huxley, John MacGillivray and artist Oswald Walters Brierly on board, accompanied by Charles Bampfield Yule in . In November 1847 he arrived at Port Curtis on the Australian coast, and after surveying the harbour described it as a very good anchorage. In 1848 he continued further north to survey New Guinea, and in June of that year offered protection and assistance to Edmund Kennedy's expedition to the Cape York Peninsula. Owen went on to survey the Louisiade Archipelago but in 1849 fell ill, and died in March 1850 after returning to Sydney.\n\nJohn MacGillivray wrote a two-volume account of the voyage of the Rattlesnake, published in 1852. \nThomas Huxley wrote a diary of the voyage which was published in 1935, edited by his grandson Julian Huxley.\n\nIn memory of his brother, Dean Stanley of Westminster Abbey donated the font in ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch.\n\nThe Owen Stanley Range in New Guinea is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

It is held the first weekend of August, to commemorate the anniversary of Bix's passing on August 6, 1931.\n\nThe musical performances are held in downtown Davenport. Additional events include a Saturday morning tribute at Oakdale Memorial Cemetery. Jazz is played over Bix's grave in the Beiderbecke family plot. This event draws huge crowds annually. Also, on Sunday morning, a jazz liturgy is held at the First Presbyterian Church in Davenport. The church was the Beiderbecke family's home church, where Bix's mother, Agatha, was the church organist. A band from the festival performs at this event.

She is also a singer of Mandopop.\n\nHo studied at Anglican High School and Victoria Junior College. Born in Singapore, she started as a pastor when she was 20 years old with her husband, Kong Hee, founding City Harvest Church. Eight years later she moved to Taiwan, where she became a Mandopop singer.\n\nAs a singer, Ho worked with producers and performers such as Wyclef Jean, Diane Warren, The Underdogs, David Foster and Carole Bayer Sager. Ho is one of the co-founders of City Harvest Church and its community services and is married to Kong Hee. Ho also led City Harvest Church's Creative Department from 1992 until late 2000, when she resigned and relocated to Taiwan, where she would do most of her recordings, to pursue her singing career. At the beginning of her music career, she faced accusations that her dressing and song lyrics were sexually charged and inappropriate for her religious background, and rumours of her using her church's support to aid in album sales. After a series of concerts, she had the opportunity to further develop her career outside of Singapore, focusing on China, Taiwan and the US.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007, Ho, based in Taiwan, released a succession of five Mandarin pop albums through Warner Music Taiwan, that have either reached double or triple platinum status. During this five-year period, Ho worked with composers such as Ma Yufen (马毓芬), the late Ma Zhaojun (马兆骏) F.I.R., Milk, Arys Chien (深白色), Lee Wei Song (李伟菘), and Tan Han Jin (陈奂仁). \"Lonely Travel\" was ranked No. 1 on nine top music charts. Her next album \"Gain\" released in 2006 reached No. 1 position on 10 top music charts. In 2007, Ho released \"Embrace\" which hit No. 1 on 11 top music charts. Her song, \"\"Starting Point\"\", was used as theme song for Singapore TV series \"\"Turning Point\"\" based on real-life inspirational stories, of which Ho was the host.\n\nIn 2003, Ho broke into Hollywood with her debut American single \"\"Where Did Love Go\",\" produced by David Foster and Peter Rafelson. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play \"Breakout\" Chart in December 2003. Subsequently, three of her singles, \"\"One With You\"\", \"\"Without Love\"\" and \"\"Gone\"\" reached No. 1 positions on the Billboard Dance Chart. \"\"Ends Of The Earth\"\" also joined the abovementioned three singles to reach No. 1 positions on the UK MusicWeek Chart. Since 2003, Ho has worked with a number of musicians such as Jimmy Harry, Diane Warren, Tony Moran, Chris Cox, Eric Kupper, Jason Nevins, Moto Blanco and the Underdogs.\n\nIn 2010, Sun Ho was questioned by the Government of Singapore when City Harvest Church came under investigation for alleged misuse of funds.\n\nAfter the City Harvest Church trial began which created an extended scrutiny of Ho's singing career, two suspension orders were imposed against her where \"Ms Ho is not involved even though she is a direct beneficiary\". She resumed her role as the Executive Director of the church in Singapore after they were lifted in May 2013 by the Commissioner of Charities (COC).\n\nOn 19 October 2015, two days before the sentencing of her husband Kong Hee, Ho was ordained by Michael Scales from Nyack College.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the six City Harvest Church leaders were sentenced to between 21 months and eight years' jail on Friday (20 November) for misappropriating S$50 million of church funds as well as criminal breach of trust, and falsification of accounts.\n\nHo's husband, senior pastor Kong Hee, the founder of the church, was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for criminal breach of trust. John Lam, former secretary of the church's management board, was sentenced to three years' jail. Sharon Tan, former finance manager, was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Former board member Chew Eng Han was given a sentence of six years and senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, five years and six months. Serina Wee, former finance manager for the church, was handed a five-year jail term.\n\nThe November 2016 appeal revealed the City Harvest Church leaders spent $24 million on Ms Sun Ho’s musical foray into the United States which included a house in Hollywood that cost $28,000 a month in rent; a whole entourage of staff; a $1.9 million paycheck to rapper Wyclef Jean to produce the \"China Wine\" video; as well as another $500,000 to sweep up her albums when they tanked.\n\nOn 6 November 2003, Ho was among 10 international nominees to be presented \"The Outstanding Young Person of the World 2003\" Award for her social work in Asia. The ceremony was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, under the auspices of JCI (Junior Chamber International). Ho is the fourth Asian celebrity to receive the award after Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nFollowing the conviction of husband Kong Hee in October 2015, the issue of \"love gifts\" from a few churchgoers deposited in a multi-purpose account (MPA) was highlighted. The MPA was set up by Kong and Ho between 2006 and 2010 from which expenses were paid for with church members' donations. \n\nExamples of expenses included more than $300,000 was spent on travel, more than $100,000 on food, more than $100,000 on make-up and medical costs that hit more than $100,000. Ho's earnings of more than $400,000 a year came from these gifts, and Kong admitted in court that donors were oblivious about Ho's earnings. The 2012 Commissioner of Charities (COC) inquiry found that $3 million was purportedly spent by Sun Ho from the MPA between April 2007 and March 2010. Givers to the MPA were not told the Crossover project was in fact funded by illegal bonds and were persuaded to give towards the project's costs. Besides Sun's 'salary' from the MPA of $400,000/year, Sun was receiving an official salary from Xtron at US$10,000/mth and entitled to 25% of project gross income, regardless and before costs.\n\nToday, Sun Ho continues to sit on the Board of City Harvest Church.\n\n"}

Watsons Bay is located 11 km north-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Woollahra.\n\nWatsons Bay sits on the end of the South Head peninsula and takes its name from the sheltered bay and anchorage on its western side, in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). It provides views across the harbour to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Gap is an ocean cliff on the eastern side with views to Manly at North Head and the Pacific Ocean. Vaucluse is the only adjacent suburb, to the south.\n\nThe original inhabitants of the area that is now known as Watsons Bay, were the Cadigal people. The Cadigal referred to the area as Kutti. This indigenous group of people fished and collected shellfish in the waters and bays off South Head. They acquired their resources from Camp Cove and carved rock engravings there, which have since eroded from the cliff faces and rock surfaces that line the coastline.\n\nWatson's Bay was named after Robert Watson (1756–1819), formerly of HMS \"Sirius\", when he had to beach his three vessels at Camp Cove for many years because of their being potentially sold by the Provost Marshal. Watson was appointed harbour pilot and harbourmaster of the port of Sydney in 1811 and the first superintendent of Macquarie Lighthouse in 1816.\n\nThe first grant of was made to Edward Laing in 1793 in the Camp Cove Area. Watsons Bay was an isolated fishing village until development began in the 1860s.\n\nOn the night of 20 August 1857, \"Dunbar\" a sailing ship became shipwrecked against the cliffs below The Gap, with 121 lives lost. The \"Dunbar\" had mistaken the bay of The Gap for the harbour entrance. In 1910, at Jacob’s Ladder, the anchor from the ship was recovered along with other relics and were placed in a museum behind the old Town Hall in Military Road by Vaucluse Council. The anchor was transferred to the cliffs of Gap Park by Ald. Coombes and a memorial was unveiled in August 1930.\n\nToday, The Gap is known as a notorious suicide spot.\n\nThe City to Watson's Bay tram line was extended from Edgecliff to Signal Hill Station, Watson's Bay in 1903 with further extensions to Gap Park in 1909. The latter extension included a new tram terminus adjacent to The Gap and a tram cutting cut into the rock face in Gap Park that ran above and parallel to Gap Road that gradually descended to street level before terminating.\n\nThe line from the city commenced with a loop at the corner of Erskine and Day Streets near Wynyard station. It then proceeded south down Day Street before turning left into King Street passing through Queen's Square at St James station. It then made a right hand turn into College Street, and headed south before turning left into Boomerang Street. The line then continued left into William Street, through King's Cross and then along Bayswater Road and into New South Head Road at Rushcutters Bay. The line then followed the course of New and Old South Head Roads before turning right into Gap Park. After turning right into Gap Park a single track passed through narrow rock cuttings, low cliffs and rugged back-drops, turning its way down to the terminus at Watsons Bay.\n\nThe line had its own depot and city terminus and operated independently, although it was connected to the main Sydney tram network. In 1949, the line from Rose Bay to Watson's Bay closed, but reopened in 1950 due to public protest. In 1950, the line down King Street to Erskine Street closed and a new terminus constructed at Queens Square. The remainder of the line closed in 1960, the tracks were removed and in 1964 the Council re-vegetated the area around the former tramway cutting in gap park with the object of restoring the area.\n\nWhen walking up the steps to The Gap at Watsons Bay, there is flat ground in between two sets of steps. This continues for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way.\n\nThe present-day State Transit route 324 follows the route of the former tram line as far as the point where the tramway turned off Old South Head Road into Gap Park. The bus and tram routes meet again near the terminus in Military Road.\n\nIn 1942, during World War II, the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was constructed on Georges Head and was designed to prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a boom net winch house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay.\n\nOn the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines attempted to enter Sydney Harbour in what became known as the Attack on Sydney Harbour. One of the Japanese midget submarines became entangled in the boom net; and, after unsuccessful attempts to free the submarine, the crew detonated charges within the sub, killing themselves and destroying their sub in the process.\n\nDuring this period, Nielsen Park was used as an anti-aircraft base. The base had its own interim wooden barracks, searchlights and anti-aircraft guns.\n\nIn Gap Park, a gun emplacement for a small calibre gun, which was never installed was also intended for use during World War II.\n\nThe novelist Christina Stead lived in 14 Pacific Street from 1911 to 1928, after which she went overseas. The house is marked with a plaque mounted in the footpath. Stead was the first writer chosen for the Woollahra Council Plaque Scheme, which was inaugurated in 2014.\n\nThe house, known as \"Boongarre\" or \"Boongaree\" was built in the 1870s. It was owned by the Stead family from 1918 to 1980 and is sometimes known as \"Stead House\". It was later acquired by the soccer player Mark Schwarzer. In 2011, Woollahra Council voted to confirm the heritage status of the house. It is now listed on the council's heritage list.\n\nIn the 2016 Census, there were 850 people in Watsons Bay. 64.6% of people were born in Australia and 78.0% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 33.8% and Catholic 19.2%.\n\nWatsons Bay is a mostly residential area with some recreational areas and beaches, including Camp Cove and a legal nude beach located at Lady Bay. Some restaurants, cafes and a hotel are located here. The coastal walk with ocean views of the Gap along South Head make Watsons Bay a popular tourist attraction in Sydney. The Sydney Harbour Pilot Boat Station was located on the bay, and the naval training base HMAS \"Watson\" is located nearby at South Head.\n\nWatsons Bay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nWatsons Bay has a large number of heritage buildings, with the following buildings listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate: Many buildings and structures are also listed as heritage items by Woollahra Council.\n\n\nEvery Man and His Dog is an annual event held in Watsons Bay on Australia Day (January 26), where men and their dogs team up on the same stand-up paddle board and race other dog lovers. Many of the participants dress up in matching dog and owner costumes.\n\nNotable people from or who have lived in Watsons Bay include:\n\n"}

Professionally, he was known as \"Slow Burn\", owing to his ability to portray on screen characters whose anger slowly rises in frustrating situations. Kennedy in many of his roles used exasperated facial expressions, performed very deliberately, to convey his rising anger or \"burn\", often rubbing his hand over his bald head and across his face in an effort to control his temper. One memorable example of his slow-burn comedy technique can be seen in the 1933 Marx Brothers' film \"Duck Soup\" in which he plays a sidewalk lemonade vendor who is harassed and increasingly provoked by Harpo and Chico.\n\nKennedy was born on April 26, 1890, in Monterey County, California, to Canadians Neil Kennedy and Annie Quinn. He attended San Rafael High School before taking up boxing. He was a light-heavyweight and once went 14 rounds with Jack Dempsey. After boxing, he worked as a singer in vaudeville, musical comedy and light opera.\n\nMaking his debut in 1911,Kennedy performed with some of the biggest film comedians in the United States, including Roscoe Arbuckle, Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, Charley Chase, and the \"Our Gang\" series. He was also one of the original Keystone Kops.\nKennedy's burly frame originally suited him for villainous or threatening roles in silent pictures. By the 1920s Kennedy was working for producer Hal Roach, who kept the actor busy playing supporting roles in short comedies. Kennedy starred in one short, \"A Pair of Tights\" (1928), in which he plays a tightwad determined to spend as little as possible on a date. His antics with comedian Stuart Erwin are reminiscent of Roach's Laurel and Hardy comedies, produced concurrently. Roach also used Kennedy as a director on half a dozen two-reeler comedies.\n\nIn 1930, Edgar Kennedy was featured by RKO-Pathe in a pair of short-subject comedies, \"Next Door Neighbors\" and \"Help Wanted, Female\". Kennedy's characterization of a short-tempered householder was so effective that RKO built a series around it. The \"Average Man\" comedies starred Kennedy as a blustery, stubborn guy determined to accomplish a household project or get ahead professionally, despite the meddling of his featherbrained wife (usually Florence Lake), her freeloading brother (originally William Eugene, then Jack Rice) and his dubious mother-in-law (Dot Farley). Kennedy pioneered the kind of domestic situation comedy that later became familiar on television. Each installment would end with Edgar embarrassed, humbled or defeated, looking at the camera and doing his patented slow burn. \"The Edgar Kennedy Series\", with its theme song \"Chopsticks\", became a standard part of the movie-going experience: Kennedy made six \"Average Man\" shorts a year for 17 years. In 1938, Kennedy worked as a straight man for British comedian Will Hay in \"Hey! Hey! USA\".\n\nKennedy became so identified with frustration that practically every studio hired him to play hotheads. He often played dumb cops, detectives, and even a prison warden; sometimes he was a grouchy moving man, truck driver, or blue-collar workman. His character usually lost his temper at least once. In \"Diplomaniacs\", Kennedy presides over an international tribunal, where Wheeler & Woolsey want to do something about world peace. \"Well, ya can't do anything about it \", yells Kennedy, \"this is a \" Kennedy, established as the poster boy for frustration, even starred in an instructional film titled \"The Other Fellow\", in which loudmouthed roadhog Edgar always vents his anger on other drivers (each one played by Kennedy as well), little realizing that, to them, is \"the other fellow.\"\n\nPerhaps his most unusual roles were as a puppeteer in the detective mystery \"The Falcon Strikes Back\" and as a philosophical bartender inspired to create exotic cocktails in Harold Lloyd's last film, \"The Sin of Harold Diddlebock\" (1947). He also played comical detectives opposite two titans of acting: John Barrymore in \"Twentieth Century\" (1934) and Rex Harrison in \"Unfaithfully Yours\" (1948). In the latter film he tells Harrison's character, a symphony conductor, \"Nobody handles Handel like you handle Handel.\"\n\nKennedy died of throat cancer at the Motion Picture Hospital, San Fernando Valley on November 9, 1948. His body was interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, Los Angeles County, California.\n\nAs actor:\n\nAs director:\n\n"}

Hence each\nnon-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes.\n\nThe theorem was proved by using the representation theory of finite groups. Several special cases of it had previously been proved by Burnside, Jordan, and Frobenius. John Thompson pointed out that a proof avoiding the use of representation theory could be extracted from his work on the N-group theorem, and this was done explicitly by for groups of odd order, and by for groups of even order. simplified the proofs.\n\nThis proof is by contradiction. Let \"pq\" be the smallest product of two prime powers, such that there is a non-solvable group \"G\" whose order is equal to this number.\nIf \"G\" had a nontrivial proper normal subgroup \"H\", then (because of the minimality of \"G\"), \"H\" and \"G\"/\"H\" would be solvable, so \"G\" as well, which would contradict our assumption. So \"G\" is simple.\n\nIf \"a\" were zero, \"G\" would be a finite q-group, hence nilpotent, and therefore solvable.\n\nSimilarly, \"G\" cannot be abelian, otherwise it would be nilpotent. As \"G\" is simple, its center must therefore be trivial.\n\nBy the first statement of Sylow's theorem, \"G\" has a subgroup \"S\" of order \"p\". Because \"S\" is a nontrivial \"p\"-group, its center \"Z\"(\"S\") is nontrivial. Fix a nontrivial element formula_2. The number of conjugates of \"g\" is equal to the index of its stabilizer subgroup \"G\", which divides the index \"q\" of \"S\" (because \"S\" is a subgroup of \"G\"). Hence this number is of the form \"q\". Moreover, the integer \"d\" is strictly positive, since \"g\" is nontrivial and therefore not central in \"G\".\n\nLet (\"χ\") be the family of irreducible characters of \"G\" over ℂ (here \"χ\" denotes the trivial character). Because \"g\" is not in the same conjugacy class as 1, the orthogonality relation for the columns of the group's character table gives:\n\nNow the \"χ\"(\"g\") are algebraic integers, because they are sums of roots of unity. If all the nontrivial irreducible characters which don't vanish at \"g\" take a value divisible by \"q\" at 1, we deduce that\n\nis an algebraic integer (since it is a sum of integer multiples of algebraic integers), which is absurd. This proves the statement.\n\nThe set of integer-valued class functions on \"G\", \"Z\"(ℤ[\"G\"]), is a commutative ring, finitely generated over ℤ. All of its elements are thus integral over ℤ, in particular the mapping \"u\" which takes the value 1 on the conjugacy class of g and 0 elsewhere.\n\nThe mapping formula_5 which sends a class function \"f\" to\n\nis a ring homomorphism. Because \"ρ\"(\"s\")\"A\"(\"u\")\"ρ\"(\"s\") = \"A\"(\"u\") for all \"s\", Schur's lemma implies that \"A\"(\"u\") is a homothety λI. Its trace \"nλ\" is equal to\n\nBecause the homothety \"λI\" is the homomorphic image of an integral element, this proves that the complex number \"λ\" = \"q\"\"χ\"(\"g\")/\"n\" is an algebraic integer.\n\nSince \"q\" is relatively prime to \"n\", by Bézout's identity there are two integers \"x\" and \"y\" such that:\n\nBecause a linear combination with integer coefficients of algebraic integers is again an algebraic integer, this proves the statement.\n\nLet \"ζ\" be the complex number \"χ\"(\"g\")/\"n\". It is an algebraic integer, so its norm \"N\"(\"ζ\") (i.e. the product of its conjugates, that is the roots of its minimal polynomial over ℚ) is a nonzero integer. Now \"ζ\" is the average of roots of unity (the eigenvalues of \"ρ\"(\"g\")), hence so are its conjugates, so they all have an absolute value less than or equal to 1. Because the absolute value of their product \"N\"(\"ζ\") is greater than or equal to 1, their absolute value must all be 1, in particular \"ζ\", which means that the eigenvalues of \"ρ\"(\"g\") are all equal, so \"ρ\"(\"g\") is a homothety.\n\nLet \"N\" be the kernel of \"ρ\". The homothety \"ρ\"(\"g\") is central in Im(\"ρ\") (which is canonically isomorphic to \"G\"/\"N\"), whereas \"g\" is not central in \"G\". Consequently, the normal subgroup \"N\" of the simple group \"G\" is nontrivial, hence it is equal to \"G\", which contradicts the fact that ρ is a nontrivial representation.\n\nThis contradiction proves the theorem.\n\n"}

In the latter part of her career she appeared in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, where she frequently played Hardy's shrewish wife.\n\nBusch was born in Melbourne, Victoria to popular Australian vaudeville performers Elizabeth Maria Lay and Frederick William Busch. Her mother had been active since 1883 under the stage names Dora Devere and then Dora Busch; she toured India with Hudson's Surprise Party and toured New Zealand twice. They continued to tour with various companies with short breaks when their two children were born, Dorothy in 1889 (who lived for only 4 months) and Annie May in 1891. Following a concert tour of New Zealand, the family left for the United States via Tahiti. They departed on 8 August 1896 and arrived in San Francisco at the end of 1896 or in early 1897.\n\nWhile her parents were touring the United States, 6-year-old Annie May was placed in a convent school in New Jersey. At the age of 12, she joined her parents as the Busch Devere Trio, which was active from 1903 until 1912. As Mae Busch she performed with her mother in Guy Fletch Bragdon's \"The Fixer\" to good reviews, and in 1911 they featured in Tom Reeves' \"Big Show Burlesque\". Mae's big break came in March 1912 when she replaced Lillian Lorraine as the lead female in \"Over the River\" with Eddie Foy.\n\nMae's first film appearances were in \"The Agitator\" and \"The Water Nymph\", both released in 1912. There is some doubt about Mae being in these films as the production of both films in California appears to clash with commitments in New York. In 1915 she began working at Keystone Studios, where she appeared in comedy two-reelers. Her dalliance with studio chief Mack Sennett famously ended his engagement to actress Mabel Normand—who had actually been Busch's mentor and friend—when Normand walked in on the pair. According to some accounts, Busch, who was known for pinpoint throwing accuracy, inflicted a serious head injury on Normand by striking her with a vase.\n\nAt the pinnacle of her film career, Busch was known as the \"versatile vamp\". She starred in such feature films as \"The Devil's Pass Key\" (1920) and \"Foolish Wives\" (1923), both directed by Erich von Stroheim, and in \"The Unholy Three\" (1925), with Lon Chaney. Her career declined abruptly after 1926, when she walked out on her contract at Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer and suffered a nervous breakdown. Afterwards, she found herself working for less prestigious studios such as Gotham and Tiffany, where she was relegated mostly to supporting roles.\n\nIn 1927, she was offered a leading role in a Hal Roach two-reeler, \"Love 'em and Weep\", which began her long association with Laurel and Hardy. She appeared in 13 of their comedies, often as shrewish, gold-digging floozies (\"Chickens Come Home\", \"Come Clean\"), a volatile wife of Oliver Hardy (\"Sons of the Desert\", \"Their First Mistake\"), or more sympathetic roles (\"Them Thar Hills\", \"Tit for Tat\", \"The Fixer Uppers\"). Her last role in a Laurel and Hardy film was in \"The Bohemian Girl\", again as a combative spouse of Hardy's, released in 1936. Her film roles after 1936 were often uncredited. Overall, she had roles in approximately 130 motion pictures between 1912 and 1946. Jackie Gleason later mentioned her name on his TV show as \"the ever-popular Mae Busch\".\n\nIn 2014, the believed-lost 1919 film which was the first feature to star Harry Houdini, \"The Grim Game\", was discovered and restored by Rick Schmidlin for Turner Classic Movies; it featured Busch.\n\nBusch married three times: to actor Francis McDonald (1915–22); to John Earl Cassell (1926–29); and to civil engineer Thomas C. Tate (1936–her death).\n\nBusch died on 20 April 1946, age 54, at a San Fernando Valley sanitarium where she had been ill for five months with colon cancer. In 1970, her ashes remained unclaimed and a chapter of The Laurel & Hardy Society, the Way Out West Tent, paid for the interment at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.\n\nFor her contributions to the film industry, Busch was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1912671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912671", "title": "Hononegah", "text": "Hononegah\n\nHononegah (c.1814–1847) was the wife of Stephen Mack Jr. an employee for The American Fur Company, a pioneer to the Rock River Valley in northern Illinois and founder of the community of Rockton, Illinois. Hononegah had a strong influence on the Roscoe-Rockton area; the high school of the four towns (the other 2 being Shirland and Harrison) and the main thoroughfare connecting the towns are both named after her.\n\nMost of what is known about Hononegah is printed in Edson I. Carr's history of Rockton, which was published in 1898. Modern scholarship, however, has discovered more about her background, and has cast doubt on several of Carr's claims.\n\nHononegah (from the Winnebago \"hinu\", the designation that she was the eldest daughter of her family, \"ni\", \"water\", and -ga which clarifies it's a name.) was born in the Teejopera (day-jope-ra), or \"Four Lakes Country\", which is modern day Madison, Wisconsin. This is given as her birthplace by N. W. Jipson. She is first seen as living in a village along the Rock River in what is now Ogle County, Illinois, and at the time of her birth, there is no evidence of the Winnebago living in this area until 1824 when Thomas Forsyth reports the existence of twelve to fourteen Winnebago villages located on the Rock River and its tributaries south of Lake Koshkonong.\n\nHononegah was portrayed by Carr as a Pottawatomie princess and a daughter of a chief. Her father, known only by his English name \"Blacksmith\", was at least half Winnebago and part Pottawatomie. Her mother was named Inoquer, and was pure Winnebago. She had one sister, Wehunsegah. After the death of her father and mother, Hononegah and her sister were raised by her uncles Conosaipkah, Estche-eshesheek, and Horohonkak, and her family moved to Illinois to a Winnebago village on the site of modern-day Grand Detour.\n\nMack (1798–1850) arrived in Grand Detour from Detroit, Michigan in 1820 and worked as a clerk in a trading post there. How and when Hononegah met Mack has not survived, only a vague tradition that Mack had become sick from fever and that Hononegah nursed him back to health.\n\nMack became somewhat of an advisor to the local chief, but it is believed he was despised by the inhabitants because he refused to sell alcohol and firearms to the people and hadn't taken one of their own as a wife. Several versions of the story survive, but all versions agree that the inhabitants attempted to murder him. One story indicates that on one occasion Hononegah hid Mack in a barrel, and in another story, Hononegah met Mack in the woods to warn him of a plot to murder him. Mack became so grateful to her that he decided to be her husband. The formalization of their relationship took place in or shortly before February 1829, when Mack bought a French trader's cabin. Mack would have been about 31, while Hononegah was just 15. They may have had a child who died at birth during the course of 1829. Their first surviving child, Rosa, was born November 14, 1830. Eight additional children were born to Stephen Mack and Hononegah: Mary born July 15, 1832; William H. born On September 14,1834; Louisa born May 6, 1836; Thomas H. born Feb. 9, 1838; Henry C. born Dec. 1, 1839; Edward born Dec. 3, 1841; Matilda born Nov. 26, 1843 and Caroline born Oct. 16, 1845. In 1840 Mack and Hononegah were married in Winnebago County, Illinois by William Hulin, Justice of the Peace. At the time Mack was concerned that if he were not legally married to Hononegah that his children would have difficulties inheriting his estate.\n\nTheir problems did not end after their marriage. During the later part of 1829, they were forced to flee Grand Detour. They found their way to a Winnebago village at the present site of Hononegah Forest Preserve between the present Illinois villages of Rockton and Roscoe. The inhabitants pledged to protect them, and there Mack established a new trading post near where Dry Run Creek meets the Rock River.\n\nOn May 9, 1832, Mack and Hononegah were run out of their trading post by Black Hawk's warriors who were sent there to confiscate Mack's supply of gunpowder. At this juncture, there is another romance about how Mack hid out on Webber's Island and that Hononegah brought Mack food and fresh water until Black Hawk's warriors had left, but this story is doubtful. Mack served during the Black Hawk War from Chicago as a guide. After the hostilities ended, Mack and Hononegah returned to their trading post.\n\nOn July 25, 1835, William Talcott and his son Thomas visited Mack at his trading post. It was then that Mack announced his intentions to found a community on the south bluff overlooking the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, which he wanted to call Pecatonic. The following autumn when the Talcotts returned to the area with their families, Mack had relocated at the site of his proposed community.\n\nBy June 1838, Jean Baptiste Beaubien, a veteran trader in Chicago, and John P. Bradstreet had become partners with Mack and began selling lots in Pecatonic. Mack made out very well in the 1837 treaty between the government and the Winnebago, and in 1839 he used some of the money he received to build a two-story frame house with a cellar. This house survives in what is now the Macktown Forest Preserve. The Talcotts lived north of the river where they dug a millrace and built a gristmill. They preferred to call the settlement Rockton, which eventually became the name of the village.\n\nWhat little that is known about Hononegah comes from reminiscences of early settlers of Pecatonic and later collected and published by Edson Carr. She was highly knowledgeable in herbal medicine and was often called upon by everyone when they became sick. She liked designing her own clothes and decorating them with beadwork. Occasionally she outdid the white women with her fashion creations, and there was one dress that was so memorable that a description of it has survived. The settlers saw her wearing a white woman's garb on only one occasion, and she was so uncomfortable that she was never seen wearing white women's clothes again. There are also traditions among some Rockton families that when their ancestors were small boys, they paddled the canoe while Hononegah speared fish. Modern scholarship has succeeded to uncover the truth about her background but has done little to reveal any more about her life and character.\n\nHononegah died on September 8, 1847. In a letter to his sister Lovicy Cooper, dated October 6, 1847, Mack describes her final illness and expresses a deep and heartfelt tribute to her: \n\n\"I have the melancholy duty to inform you that the death published in the paper I sent you was that of my wife. Her health had been failing for several months but was not so as to prevent her from taking the ordinary care of her family until she was attacked by what the doctor called a bilious fever but what I called a lung fever - of this she was sick eight or nine days and died. She was sensible to the last moment and took leave of her children and friends a few hours before she died.\n\n\"You say that by the notice in the paper you perceive she died a Christian.\n\"If I know what a Christian is, she was one, not by profession but by her every act, her every deed proclaimed her a follower of Christ. In her the hungry and the naked have lost a benefactor, the sick a nurse and I have lost a friend who taught me to reverence God by doing good to his creatures.\n\n\"Her funeral proved that I am not the only sufferer by her loss. My house is large, but it was filled to overflowing by mourning friends who assembled to pay the last sad duties to her who had set them the example how to live and how to die.\" Years later William C. Blinn related that after Hononegah's funeral, \"a little knot of neighbors were speaking of the loss. George Stevens, the postmaster, one of the parties, said most impressively, 'The best woman in Winnebago County died last night', the neighbors all nodding in agreement.\"\n\nToday, the spirits of Hononegah and Stephen Mack live on in Rockton and the surrounding communities. There is Hononegah High School, Stephen Mack Middle School, Hononegah and Macktown forest preserves, and various other parks, buildings, and businesses that use the names Macktown or Hononegah. A cheerleader from the high school is designated \"Princess Hononegah\" and performs a dance at most major school sporting events.\n\n"}
{"id": "1912688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912688", "title": "Boresight (firearm)", "text": "Boresight (firearm)\n\nBoresighting is a method of visually pre-aligning a firearm barrel's bore axis with the target, in order to more easily zero the gunsight (optical or iron sights). The process is usually performed on a rifle, and can be accomplished either with the naked eye, or with a specialized device called a boresighter.\n\nOptical boresighting, also referred to as eyeball boresighting, as the name suggests, involves using the naked eye and the bore axis of a firearm to dial in the sights of a firearm. Based on the type of firearm the procedure for optical bore sighting will vary. For AR style rifles the upper receiver can be dropped from the lower receiver and the bolt carrier group (BCG) can be removed exposing a clear line of sight through the barrel. With the upper receiver fixed in place you can then co-witness thorough the barrel and the sights on the top of the rifle, while doing this you can visually align the bore axis with the sights on a desired target. For bolt actions rifles the process is the same aside from the ability to remove different receivers, but the bolt can still be removed to view through the barrel. \n\nOnce you are able to align the bore axis and the sights on the firearm you should then be able to at least get shots on or close to the target. With the rifle reassembled you should be able to put shots down range and make more fine tuned adjustments.\n\nA draw back of using the naked eye to boresight is that it can be difficult due to the tunnel vision and lack of brightness, especially with longer-barreled guns. A more advanced method of boresighting uses a collimator boresighter, an optical attachment similar to a scope sight, which fits onto the muzzle end of the barrel via a bore-diameter arbor and projects a grid pattern onto the sight picture. Using this method, the normal sight (which is fixed to the receiver) and the collimator (which is fixed to the barrel) can be sighted to match. Most collimators have grid patterns for rechecking the zero after the barrel is sighted.\n\nA more modern method of boresighting is to use a laser pointer rather than by visual inspection to illuminate the distant point of aim. This method is preferable because it has less parallax, allows more movement in the gun as the projected laser dot will not move relative to the barrel, and does not require the removing the bolt.\n\nAs laser technology has become less expensive, laser boresighters have become popular for sighting in rifles. One type of laser boresighter is shaped like a cartridge, and when inserted into the chamber projects a laser beam through the barrel onto the target. The user then adjusts the iron sights or the scope reticle are aligned to the projected laser dot. Another type of laser boresighter is more commonly used and is attached to the muzzle of the barrel, either by inserting into the bore (\"arbor\" type) or via a magnet, and is held in alignment with the barrel and projects a laser beam onto the target. Again, the user aligns the sights to the laser dot on the target.\n\nNo matter which method of bore sighting is used, the result is to align the sights to the spot where the barrel is pointing at a particular distance. Because of variations in the trajectory of ammunition and other factors, the bore-sighted rifle will probably not shoot to that exact spot, and live ammunition will need to be fired to further fine-tune the sighting process.\n\nAccuracy is the measure of how well the sighted object is represented. It can be measured from a specific decision-making circumstance, like the orientation of notches of a gun barrel. Alternatively, the device could be designed to accommodate a range of circumstances and still be sufficiently accurate.\n"}

Defiant (released as Damn the Defiant! in the United States) is a British naval war CinemaScope and Technicolor film from 1962 starring Alec Guinness and Dirk Bogarde. It tells the story of a mutiny aboard the fictitious ship of the title at around the time of the Spithead mutiny. It was directed by Lewis Gilbert, with a screenplay by Nigel Kneale from Frank Tilsley's novel \"Mutiny\" (1958). The film had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London's West End on 22 February 1962.\n\nIn 1797, the humane Captain Crawford (Alec Guinness) is in command of the warship HMS \"Defiant\" during the French Revolutionary Wars. He soon finds himself in a battle of wills with his first officer, the sadistic and supercilious first lieutenant, Mr. Scott-Padget (Dirk Bogarde). The lieutenant believes that Crawford is too soft on his crew, and also disagrees with the captain's decision to follow his orders to sail to Corsica despite word that Napoleon has overrun much of Italy. Scott-Padget has powerful family connections, which he has used in the past to \"beach\" two previous commanding officers with whom he disagreed. Knowing that Crawford is helpless to intervene, Scott-Padget subjects the Captain's son, Midshipman Harvey Crawford (David Robinson), to excessive daily punishments so as to gain leverage over the captain.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the crew, led by seaman Vizard (Anthony Quayle), are preparing to mutiny for better conditions, in conjunction with similar efforts throughout the British fleet. They eventually pledge virtually the entire crew.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the \"Defiant\" encounters a French frigate escorting a merchant ship. After a sharp engagement, a boarding party from the \"Defiant\" captures the French frigate, and the merchantman surrenders. Crawford dispatches his son as part of the prize crew tasked to sail the captured merchantman to a British port, thereby placing him out of Scott-Padget's reach. Crawford tells Scott-Padget that bringing his son with him was a mistake, but now he's \"put it right!\" He further vows to take actions that will \"astound\" his second-in-command. Before long, Scott-Padget is confined to quarters as punishment for insubordination. His humiliation is compounded by the requirement that he appear on deck every two hours in full dress uniform, a punishment usually reserved for young midshipmen.\n\nSoon, \"Defiant\" fights and captures a Venetian frigate, taking on many prisoners. Crawford is severely wounded in the action and eventually loses his arm. Discovered among the prisoners is a key aide to Napoleon, from whom the British learn important information about a planned invasion of Britain.\n\nWith Crawford incapacitated, Scott-Padget takes command, but his brutality goads the crew into a premature mutiny. Appealing to their patriotism, Crawford convinces Vizard and the other mutineers to sail for the main British fleet blockading Rochefort to warn them of the impending invasion. Crawford promises to intercede for the crew as best he can, on the condition that none of the officers are harmed.\n\nAs the \"Defiant\" reaches the fleet at Rochefort, they receive word that the main British fleet has already mutinied, with the Admiralty agreeing to most of the sailors' demands. The crew's jubilation at the news is cut short when a hot-headed seaman, Evans, murders Scott-Padget. Realising that they are now all doomed to punishment as mutineers, an enraged Vizard kills Evans. Their only course now is to try to escape with the ship.\n\nJust then, the French fleet sallies out from port, and a French fireship is sighted heading straight for the British flagship. As the only ship under sail, the \"Defiant\" has the unique opportunity to save the flagship. Once again, Crawford appeals to the crew's patriotism, making no promises but convincing them to intercept the fireship. Vizard is killed in the ensuing action, living just long enough to hear a message from the British admiral thanking \"Defiant\" for their gallant actions.

Each consists of three lines, each line either \"broken\" or \"unbroken\", respectively representing yin or yang. Due to their tripartite structure, they are often referred to as Eight Trigrams in English.\n\nThe trigrams are related to Taiji or Taegeuk (in Korean) philosophy, Taijiquan and the Wu Xing, or \"five elements\". The relationships between the trigrams are represented in two arrangements, the \"Primordial\" (), \"Earlier Heaven\" or \"Fu Xi\" bagua (), and the \"Manifested\" (), \"Later Heaven,\" or \"King Wen\" bagua. The trigrams have correspondences in astronomy, astrology, geography, geomancy, anatomy, the family, and elsewhere.\n\nThe ancient Chinese classic, I Ching (Pinyin: Yi Jing), consists of the 64 pairwise permutations of trigrams, referred to as \"hexagrams\", along with commentary on each one.\n\nThere are two possible sources of \"bagua\". The first is from traditional Yin and Yang philosophy. This is explained by Fuxi in the following way:\n\nAnother possible source of \"bagua\" is the following, attributed to King Wen of Zhou Dynasty: \"When the world began, there was heaven and earth. Heaven mated with the earth and gave birth to everything in the world. Heaven is \"Qian\"-gua, and the Earth is \"Kun\"-gua. The remaining six guas are their sons and daughters\".\n\nThe trigrams are related to the five elements of Wu Xing, used by Feng Shui practitioners and in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Those five elements are Water, Wood, Fire, Earth and Metal. The Water (Kan) and Fire (Li) trigrams correspond directly with the Water and Fire elements. The element of Earth corresponds with both the trigrams of Earth (Kun) and Mountain (Gen). The element of Wood corresponds with the trigrams of Wind (Xun) (as a gentle but inexorable force that can erode and penetrate stone) and Thunder (Zhen). The element of Metal corresponds with the trigrams of Heaven (Qian) and Lake (Dui).\n\nThere are eight possible combinations to render the various trigrams ( \"bāguà\"):\nThis is also known as the \"binary sequence\" or Shao Yong sequence. A binary interpretation of each hexagram is made by interpreting yin as \"0\" and yang as \"1\", and reading the leading \"digit\" from the inside of the diagram, so the hexagram \"kūn\" is interpreted as 0, and \"gèn\" as 1. The hexagrams are in binary order when read up from the bottom around on the right, then up again on the left to the top.\n\nCycles of elements in this chart: (Generative/Counter-clockwise), (Destructive/Clockwise)\n\nFire brings water, water feeds wood, wood brings metal, metal brings fire\n\nFire melts metal, metal chops wood, wood drains water, water quenches fire\n\nCycles of elements in this chart: (Generative/Counter-clockwise),(Destructive/Clockwise)\n\nWater feeds wood, wood brings metal, metal brings fire, fire brings water\n\nWater quenches fire, fire melts metal, metal chops wood, wood drains water\n\nThe Bagua is an essential tool in the majority of Feng Shui schools. The Bagua used in Feng shui can appear in two different versions: the \"Earlier Heaven Bagua\", used for burial sites, and the \"Later Heaven Bagua\", used for the residences.\n\nIn Xiantian Bagua, also known as Fu Xi Bagua or Earlier Heaven Bagua, the Heaven is in the higher part and the Earth is in the lower part. The trigram Qian (Heaven) is at the top, the trigram Kun (Earth) is at the bottom (in the past, the South was located at the top in Chinese maps). The trigram Li (Fire) is located on the left and opposite to it is the trigram Kan (Water). Zhen (Thunder) and Xun (Wind) form another pair, while being one opposite the other, the first on the bottom left next to Li while the second is next to Qian on the top right of the Bagua. Gen (Mountain) and Dui (Lake) form the last pair, one opposite the other, both in balance and harmony. The adjustment of the trigrams is symmetrical by forming exact contrary pairs. They symbolize the opposite forces of Yin and Yang and represent an ideal state, when everything is in balance.\n\nThe sequence of the trigrams in Houtian Bagua, also known as the Bagua of King Wen or Later Heaven Bagua, describes the patterns of the environmental changes. Kan is placed downwards and Li at the top, Zhen in the East and Dui in the West. Contrary to the Earlier Heaven Bagua, this one is a dynamic Bagua where energies and the aspects of each trigram flow towards the following. It is the sequence used by the Luo Pan compass which is used in Feng Shui to analyze the movement of the Qi that affects us.\n\nFeng shui was made very popular in the Occident thanks to the Bagua of the eight aspirations. Each trigram corresponds to an aspect of life which, in its turn, corresponds to one of the cardinal directions. Applying feng shui using the Bagua of the eight aspirations (or Bagua map for short) made it possible to simplify feng shui and to bring it within the reach of everyone. Western Bagua focuses more heavily on the power of intention than the traditional forms of feng shui.\n\nMasters of traditional feng shui disregard this approach, for its simplicity, because it does not take into account the forms of the landscape or the temporal influence or the annual cycles. The Bagua of the eight aspirations is divided into two branches: the first, which uses the compass and cardinal directions, and the second, which uses the Bagua by using the main door. It is clear that, not taking into account the cardinal directions, the second is even more simplified.\n\nA bagua map is a tool used in Western forms of feng shui to map a room or location and see how the different sections correspond to different aspects in one's life. These sections are believed to relate to every area or aspect of life and are divided into such categories as: fame, relationships/marriage, children/creativity, helpful people/travel, career, inner knowledge, family/ancestors/health, and wealth/blessings.\n\nIn this system, the map is intended to be used over the land, one's home, office or desk to find areas lacking good chi, and to show where there are negative or missing spaces that may need rectifying or enhancing in life or the environment.\n\nFor example, if the bagua grid is placed over the entire house plan and it shows the toilet, bathroom, laundry, or kitchen in the wealth/blessings area it would be considered that the money coming into that particular environment would disappear very fast, as if to be 'going down the drain.'\n\nThe bagua symbols are in the Miscellaneous Symbols block of Unicode:\n"}

A foot-lambert equals 1/π or 0.3183 candela per square foot, or 3.426 candela per square meter (the corresponding SI unit). The foot-lambert is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777), a Swiss-German mathematician, physicist and astronomer. It is rarely used by electrical and lighting engineers, in favor of the candela per square foot or candela per square meter.\n\nThe luminance of a perfect Lambertian diffuse reflecting surface in foot-lamberts is equal to the incident illuminance in foot-candles. For real diffuse reflectors, the ratio of luminance to illuminance in these units is roughly equal to the reflectance of the surface. Mathematically,\nwhere\n\nThe foot-lambert is used in the motion picture industry for measuring the luminance of images on a projection screen. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) recommended, in SMPTE 196M, a screen luminance of 16 foot-lamberts for commercial movie theaters, when measured \"open-gate\" (i.e. with no film in the projector). (Typical base density of 0.05 yields peak white of about 14 fL.) The current revision of SMPTE 196M specifies 55 candela per square meter (nits). \n\nThe foot-lambert is also used in the flight simulation industry to measure the highlight brightness of visual display systems. The minimum required highlight brightness varies based on the type and level of Flight Simulation Training Device (FSTD), but is generally 3–6 foot-lamberts for most devices qualified under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) regulations.\n\nMilitary specifications for illuminated switches, panels, and displays, such as MIL-PRF-22885 and SAE AS7788, also require luminance measurements in foot-lamberts. Luminance levels can vary from hundreds of foot-lamberts for sunlight readable switch displays per MIL-PRF-22885 to only a few foot-lamberts in night conditions for panels in accordance with SAE AS7788.\n\nOther units of luminance:\n\n"}
{"id": "1912722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912722", "title": "LGBT student movement", "text": "LGBT student movement\n\nThe origin of the LGBT student movement can be linked to other activist movements from the mid-20th century in the United States. The Civil Rights Movement and Second-wave feminist movement were working towards equal rights for other minority groups in the United States. Though the student movement began a few years before the Stonewall riots, the riots helped to spur the student movement to take more action in the US. Despite this, the overall view of these gay liberation student organizations received minimal attention from contemporary LGBT historians. This oversight stems from the idea that the organizations were founded with haste as a result of the riots. Others historians argue that this group gives too much credit to groups that disagree with some of the basic principles of activist LGBT organizations.\n\nThough the times and places of the student movement vary, the goals are often similar including: abolishing sodomy laws, equality on campuses for LGBT students, increasing money for HIV/AIDS research, the legalization of same-sex marriage, to prevent the bullying and suicide of LGBT youth, and gain visibility for LGBT peoples. LGBT student organizations today have started to involve research to improve the understanding of basic activism ideas. Using historical research as a source to identify and differentiate successful approaches. The identities of student activists and their involvement tends to shape the different organizations across campuses. The student movements have not always been successful in their goals, but they have been able to bring visibility to the LGBT community in their area as well as working to promote equality for a better future for their community.\n\nMany colleges in Australia have a Students' union that helps support LGBT student activism financially and otherwise. Often the right to have a safe space and LGBT officers is written into the student union policy. The LGBT student activists use media to help spread the word about issues in Australia that they deem important to the community such as Same-sex marriage. This means that LGBT students in Australia's colleges and universities have good visibility on their campuses. The students are using this visibility to try to get same-sex marriage legalized in their country.\n\nThe topic of same-sex marriage being legalized in Australia was brought to the forefront of LGBT students when it became legal in Canada. Two same-sex couples traveled to Canada in order to be able to marry their partners, and then attempted to get their marriage recognized when they came back to Australia. The government then used the Marriage Act 1961 (Australia) in order to deny the recognition of the legality of their marriages. The students want to change the definition of marriage so that it is a less fascist convention and is closer to their own views of what marriage should be.\n\nGroups of student activists are attempting to change teaching material in Chinese schools they believe may cause discrimination towards LGBT students. The move for this is due to the Guangzhou-based Gay and Lesbian Campus Association report that shows that 40% of the mentions within the Chinese textbooks refer to homosexuality as a mental illness. Along with changes to the textbooks, the groups want universities to allow LGBT student organizations and groups on campuses which are not accepted well on campuses either. Another thing the group wants to promote is better protection for LGBT students from bullies since 3/4 of students mention having been bullied because of their sexuality. The groups hope to change this or eliminate it by changing regulations and rules within the schools.\n\nIn 2004, a private American school in Mexico City, Mexico was the first school in Mexico to create a Gay–straight alliance.\n\nThe GSA has succeeded in bringing attention to issues of discrimination towards the LGBT students and opened up a school-wide discussion about what the LGBT students deal with at school. The GSA is working to provide support and safe space for LGBT students, providing information about and for LGBT, and raise awareness for LGBT issues.\n\nThe country's first gay liberation movement was started at the University of Toronto in 1969 and was originally called the University of Toronto Homophile Association. It is now called LGBTOUT for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and trans people, of the University of Toronto. The Homophile Association was created as a student-run organization to help other LGBT students socialize in a safe environment where they wouldn't be judged for their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Their first meeting had 16 students, but their group was quickly populating the room they had booked for meetings.\n\nWaterloo Universities Gay Liberation Movement was formed in 1971 at the University of Waterloo. It is the country's oldest continuous running LGBT student organization, which is now called the Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity. Its first meeting had over 100 people attend. The organization was centred on fighting for equal rights in all branches of life including marriage and adoption rights. They ran social events, led protests, and arranged support circles. \n\nIn 2017, the Conservative party in Ontario announced plans to repeal the 2015 sex-education curriculum and replace it with the 1998 version to give the party time to develop a new curriculum that pleases educators and parents. Students staged a walk-out against repealing the 2015 curriculum which included topics like same-sex marriage, consent, and gender identity. The walk-out had close to 90% participation in some schools.\n\nIn 2019, the United Conservative party in Alberta announced plans to overturn a law that makes it illegal for teachers to inform parents of their child’s attendance in their school’s Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) club. In response, students led protests in 90 schools which had anywhere from dozens to hundreds of students protesting.\n\nIn 2019, a counter-rally was held in support of sexual orientation and gender identity rights in Vancouver on the University of British Columbia's Point Grey campus. Jenn Smith, a transgender male, was set to hold an event on UBC’s campus about how transgender politics in schools harm children and how they harm women in society. Dozens of student protestors held signs discouraging Smith from speaking claiming his talk was hate speech as it was transphobic.\n\nIn the US the student movement began in secret in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, Stephen Donaldson and a few other students at Columbia University used the structure of the Mattachine Society to form an underground society called the Student Homophile League. That year, the group could not get university recognition due to the group not giving a list of names of the members to the school to protect them. This led to no funding or space for the group. This made it difficult to gain new members. Nevertheless, Donaldson found a way to get recognition by the university, and the group became the first recognized student gay rights group.\n\nAfter hearing about the SHL at Columbia students at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY began inquiring about starting their own branch on campus. The \"Cornell Daily Sun\" reported that the administration would not stop a group from forming on campus, following a tradition of acknowledging contested groups on campus. Jearld Moldenhauer founded the group in 1968 and similar to the experience Donaldson faced at Columbia, students were hesitant to join, and membership remained low.\n\nStudents at Cornell who joined SHL did so under pseudonyms. At the beginning there were more heterosexual students than homosexual students, partially to attract members but at the same time was used as a protection strategy. By spring 1969 group tensions were high and a split began to occur, as some members wanted to keep focus on civil liberties and others wanted the group to only focus on gay and lesbian issues. By 1971 the group became known as the Gay Liberation Front, which was associated with such groups on the Cornell campus as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).\nIn 1989 there were no known GSAs in any high school or junior high within the United States even though 97% of high school students admitted to hearing anti-gay remarks in school and many LGBT students felt unsafe enough that they would skip classes. Then LGBT and straight students at private schools in Massachusetts joined together to create the first Gay–straight alliances. Even though the groups received much opposition, the groups popped up in more and more schools across the country. As of 2011, there are more than 4,000 GSAs in middle schools and high schools across the United States.\n\nThe University of Arizona's LGBT student group, \"Pride Alliance,\" has been active since the 1990s in providing visibility to LGBT students and faculty at the University. Some of the students' activism also works to provide a safe and welcoming environment for LGBT students. This goal stems from studies showing that LGBT college students have higher levels of depression, bullying, and suicide. Campus-wide activism, at the University of Arizona and at many colleges, has focused on dealing with these issues with respect for the LGBT community.\n\nA renewed interest in LGBT rights brought about the formation of the Florida Collegiate Pride Coalition in 2003 with chapter from Florida Gulf Coast University, University of Central Florida, University of Miami, and University of South Florida. The group holds an annual conference where multiple LGBT Social groups meet up, including people from out of state. In 2011, the group agreed to expand to help the LGBT members and allies network with college organizations to develop growth in its members personal and professional lives. This forum of LGBT college and university students in Florida is known to work with Equality Florida.\n\nLouisiana State University, the flagship University of Louisiana, has progressively increased the awareness of LGBT organizations throughout campus. Spectrum was an organization that began in 1977 by and for LSU students as the Gay and Lesbian Student Association. Originally students involved did not feel particularly accepted so, in turn, held their meetings at off-campus locations. In 1999 a group of students felt unhappy with the mainly private nature of the LGBT movement so they formed the Spectrum Alliance. This became the public activism group that now holds over 100 members on LSU's campus.\n\nIn the fall of 2014 LSU also added a program that allows students to minor in LGBT studies. It consists of an 18-hour curriculum pinpointing social sciences created by Dr. Elaine M. Maccio who teaches in social work - where the minor is also housed. The new found program allows students who desire to obtain a better understanding of LGBT ideals and activism now have the opportunity to do so for course credit.\n\nIn 2012, the students at University of Notre Dame were able to get an official LGBT organization after requesting the addition of one 15 times. Notre Dame was the last of the top 20 universities in the United States to add an LGBT organization. The students at Notre Dame were able to get the group by assessing the environment on campus for the LGBT students and writing a review that was submitted to the president of the school. After five months of review, the president decided that allowing the organization went along with the school's policies to embrace inclusivity.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, The Pennsylvania Student Equality Coalition was founded as an independent and youth-led statewide LGBT organization by Pennsylvania students in April 2011. As of 2012, PSEC is connected with over 70 student LGBT organizations across Pennsylvania. The coalition is focused on campus-community organizing for LGBT equality in Pennsylvania and resource development for educational institutions.\n\nOver the last several years a number of studies have been done on interventions and interactions among students and LGBT groups on college campuses. Numerous studies have concluded that the more interactions undergraduates have with the LGBT community on campus, the more accepting attitudes are in the following ways \"1.Same-sex, consensual sex. 2. Same-sex relations between adults is not unnatural. 3. Vote for a gay presidential candidate. 4. Friends with a feminine man. 5. Friends with a masculine woman. 6. Knowledge of [gay and lesbian] issues important for a future career. 7. Comfortable with a [gay, lesbian] roommate.\" Students who frequently interact and involve themselves with campus activities are likely to be more open to views different from their own.\n\nStudents who are present when an LGBT student is being harassed frequently will depend on the relation between the two. Meaning, that if the bystander knows the bullying victim or is known around campus themselves, it is more likely that they will intervene. However, intervention is less likely to occur when passive bystanders are present. Studies show that it is important for universities to foster initiatives that increase LGBT bystander interventions.\n\nOver the past decade, academic institutions have been making strides in aiding LGBT students on campus. These inclusive resources include the creation of gender- neutral housing and bathrooms, educational programming, and creating other initiatives to help foster equality. However, according to a 2010 study done at multiple institutions indicated from responses by LGBT students, that LGBT students were more likely to receive harassment and discrimination that heterosexuals. Therefore, resulting in lower education outcomes, low self- esteem, and wakened emotional, mental, and physical health.\n\nOne of the ways that heterosexism is enabled on college campuses was through heterosexist language and communicated anti-gay sentiments towards LGBTQ people. One factor that effects the college climate they experience is how they choose or if they choose to disclose their identities. Resources have been created to help promote non-hostile environments are initiatives like The Transgender On-Campus NonDiscrimination Project (TONI). TONI is an online resource center for students, faculty, and staff alike to learn about and gather general information on transgender students in higher education.\n\nLGBTQ Resource Centers have been created on campus to help students have a welcoming space on campus. However, many argue that LGBTQ rights in the United States primarily focus on as gay and lesbian people. This leaves out those who identify as transgender and queer. According to a study on transgender centers on campuses, there are many events that relate to trans issues, but instead of being with these communities, the programming created is about the transgender community. Including and fostering the \"practice and process\" of inclusion should remain the primary focus rather than a \"singular point of 'liberation'\".\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Ring of Honor (ROH) under the ring name Steve Corino.\n\nCorino has held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, the MLW World Heavyweight Championship, and the 1PW World Heavyweight Championship once each, and the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship and the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship twice each. In addition to these titles, he has also held the ROH World Tag Team Championship once, as well as numerous titles on the independent circuit.\n\nCorino began wrestling in 1994 and spent four years working on the independent circuit. During this time, he was a part of the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts, a promotion run by Matt and Jeff Hardy. Corino began an anti-hardcore gimmick on the independent circuit, because he felt he would have more chance of getting work if he did not work hardcore matches. He gained experience, working in Puerto Rico for the WWC, working under the ring name Lightning Kid (which had been a gimmick previously used by Sean Waltman) and also made some appearances for the WWF as a jobber.\n\nIn 1998, Corino debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as a heel manager. He stood out in ECW as a result of his \"King of Old School\" gimmick, where he would deride hardcore wrestlers, at one point invading a Limp Bizkit concert and protesting the immoral conduct.\n\nIn late 1999, Corino took Jack Victory on as a manager, and became an advisor for Tajiri and Rhino. He then began feuding with Dusty Rhodes, who defeated him in a gory Bullrope match at Living Dangerously. At Heat Wave 2000, he lost to Jerry Lynn. Corino went on to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on November 5, 2000 at November to Remember by defeating Justin Credible, Sandman and Champion Jerry Lynn in a Double Jeopardy match; then to successfully defend it at Massacre on 34th Street in December against Jerry Lynn and Justin Credible in a three way dance.\n\nDue to repeated failures of ECW paying Corino his salary, he left the company on January 7, 2001, the night he lost the ECW World Title at Guilty as Charged 2001 to Sandman. His friend Dustin Rhodes got him a contract in World Championship Wrestling, but he never got to make an appearance despite being due to debut at the company's third to last PPV Sin. When World Wrestling Entertainment took over WCW in March 2001, they released Corino from his contract. He went on to wrestle for many of the National Wrestling Alliance regional promotions. On April 24, he won the NWA World Heavyweight title.\n\nCorino continued his feud with Rhodes in his Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion as well as Southern Championship Wrestling and was part of the Extreme Horsemen with C.W. Anderson and Barry Windham. He was also part of the Extreme Horsemen in Major League Wrestling with C.W. Anderson, Justin Credible and Simon Diamond. They were briefly managed by the legendary James J. Dillon before MLW folded. Also, Corino went on to win the MLW World Heavyweight Championship before the promotion was folded.\n\nIn 2004 Corino made a number of appearances for Frontier Wrestling Alliance in the United Kingdom, where he entered a short rivalry with Alex Shane. The feud culminated in the main event match of Hotwired, where Corino defeated Shane with the assistance of then FWA Heavyweight Champion, Doug Williams.\n\nAs Steve Corino was a major part of ECW towards the end of its run, rumors swirled surrounding Corino possibly signing with World Wrestling Entertainment and returning to his ECW roots as a part of the new version of ECW, but he squashed those rumors in a posting on his LiveJournal.\n\nInstead of signing with WWE, Corino worked in various independent promotions, including Zero-One, Hustle in Japan, Ring of Honor in the United States and both One Pro Wrestling and Celtic Wrestling in the United Kingdom. He was also president of World-1 Fighting Arts, which runs shows in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nCorino also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during its early days. Corino had matches with Low Ki and many other stars before leaving the promotion some time later.\n\nResponding to a challenge from The Backseat Boyz, Homicide invited anyone in the locker room to be his partner. Steve Corino made his ROH debut and responded to his offer, resulting in the two facing the Backseat Boys later that night. In the course of the match, Corino turned on Homicide after Homicide accidentally hit him, Old School Kicking his partner and leaving the ring, enabling the Backseat Boyz to easily defeat Homicide.\n\nHomicide and Corino would then begin a four-year rivalry, with Corino criticizing Homicide's lifestyle and somewhat checkered past. The feud culminated in a match at the \"One Year Anniversary Show\" on February 8, 2003 in Queens, New York, New York. Homicide was the hometown favorite, but lost to Corino following interference from The Group (Samoa Joe, Michael Shane, C.W. Anderson and Simply Luscious), Corino's entourage.

Corino began feuding with Mike Bennett, and the two faced each other at \"Manhattan Mayhem IV\" on March 19, with Bennett picking up the victory. On May 21 at \"Supercard of Honor VI\", Corino revealed the returning Jimmy Jacobs as the sponsor, who had helped him change his ways.

On June 23, S.C.U.M. was forced to disband, after being defeated by Team ROH in a Steel Cage Warfare match.\n\nSince the dissolution of S.C.U.M., Corino has been working with ROH as their regular color commentator alongside play-by-play commentator Kevin Kelly and occasionally Nigel McGuinness while simultaneously having a running feud with B.J. Whitmer and The Decade. The rivalry has included Whitmer goading Corino to join The Decade, with Corino refusing, but Whitmer wasn't talking about Steve but his real-life son Colby and successfully recruiting him into The Decade. During his feud, McGuinness warned Corino that he can't attack any ROH employee or he will be suspended. After attacking Whitmer with a roll of quarters, McGuinness suspended and banned him from commentary, but then, he was reinstated as a wrestler and was scheduled to fight Whitmer in a Fight without Honor at Final Battle, but Corino announced that he was gonna have neck surgery and that his career may end. He continued to commentary with a mask under the name of Mr. Wrestling 3. Even he was taking that gimmick, Whitmer was saying that Mr. Wrestling 3 was indeed Steve Corino and was convincing Colby, that Corino replaced him for Corino's new wife and son, and Whitmer continued torturing Colby in front of Corino's eyes. At War of the Worlds, Corino returned as the Steve Corino character, admitting that he didn't want to be the \"Evil Man\" anymore, but after Whitmer's deeds, he promised that at the newly reinstated match that will happen at Best in the World 2016, he will do things that he will never apologize for. At Best in the World, Corino faced Whitmer in a Non-Sanctioned Fight without Honor, but he lost after the interference of Kevin Sullivan. After Best in the World, Corino returned to commentating, but during Whitmer's matches, he was continuously berated by Sullivan. At the Final Battle event, Cody, who defeated Jay Lethal, proceeded to cause chaos in the ring and then he pushed Corino. The night at the event, Whitmer said that a \"brother\" has to be sacrificed, which was revealed that Corino was about to fight Cody, who berated Corino's actions with Dusty Rhodes. In their match, Corino lost to Cody, which was Corino's last match in ROH. Corino's ROH contract expired on December 31, 2016.\n\nIn November 2016, Corino worked as a guest trainer at the WWE Performance Center.

{"id": "1912732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912732", "title": "Six Foot Track", "text": "Six Foot Track\n\nThe Six Foot Track was originally a bridle trail from Katoomba (New South Wales, Australia) to the Jenolan Caves, and is now a walking trail of 44.3 kilometers. \n\nThe Jenolan Caves are a tourist attraction that first became popular in the mid and late nineteenth century. The journey to the caves from Sydney was a long one, though, and even after the western railway was completed to Bathurst in 1870, the journey involved a lengthy horse ride from the nearest station at Tarana.\n\nIn 1884 a New South Wales government party marked out a new horse track from Katoomba across the Coxs River to shorten the journey. The track was constructed to be six feet wide (in order that two loaded drays could pass each other at any point), and was completed at a cost of £2500, although it was not until 1937 that the track became known as the Six Foot Track, by which time it was already close to impassable.\n\nThe first recorded journey on the track was in 1887 by the NSW Governor, Lord Carrington, and his wife. The journey from start to finish took approximately eight hours and was very popular until motor vehicles gradually took over in the twentieth century, and an alternative route to Jenolan was built.\n\nToday the Six Foot Track is one of Australia’s most iconic and well-known overland tracks.\n\nStarting on the western outskirts of Katoomba at the Explorers tree, the track descends via steep steps through the temperate rainforest of Nellies Glen to the Megalong Valley floor. Here in the valley the track passes the historical site of the abandoned shale mining Megalong Village and continues on through farmland past the Megalong Cemetery (this is just off the track).\n\nThe track winds along the steep-sided banks of the Coxs River. The river is crossed either via ford or by using a suspension bridge, called Bowtells Swing Bridge, built by 3 Troop, the 'Tunnel Rats' of the 1st Field Squadron of the Royal Australian Engineers in 1991. It was named in honour of CPL Bob Bowtell a former member of 3 Tp. Bob was born in Katoomba and he died in Vietnam. He was one of the famous 'Tunnel Rats' and he died in a tunnel clearance. His children attended the opening of the bridge in 1992.\n\nA dedicated campsite is available where most people camp the night before the demanding climb up to Mini-Mini Saddle the next morning and then the descent to Alum Creek.\n\nAnother challenging uphill climb is then tackled with the rise to the Pluviometer which is situated towards the eastern end of the Black Range ridge. This is followed by a slightly-inclining walk along the ridgeline to the dedicated Black Range Campsite. From here the track crosses then hugs close to Jenolan Road before diverting to the final descent to the limestone caves at Jenolan.\n\nThe track is best walked in spring or autumn due to the heat and bushfire hazards of summer and the cold nights and rain of winter. The track can be walked in either direction. \n\nThere is a popular running race, the Six Foot Track Marathon, along the length of the trail every March. In 2009, 849 runners started the race at Explorers Tree. This race has become iconic, one of the premier long distance events in the world and celebrated its 25th anniversary on 8 March 2008.\n\nRelevant topographic maps for the track are available from the NSW Department of Lands, maps \"Katoomba\" (8930-1S), \"Hampton\" (8930-4S) and \"Jenolan\" (8930-3N) cover the entirety of the track. Or Download and print the full map set on the PDF from wildwalks\n\nHere is a terrain profile of the walk (via the swing bridge) Starting from the Katoomba End,\n\n\n"}

Sullivan and Williams' NWA United States Tag Team Championship was not on the line, despite being the champions. Animal and Williams started the match. Hawk and Animal dominated Williams in the beginning. Williams eventually tagged in Sullivan. Sullivan and Williams double-teamed Animal. Hawk and Williams battled each other and the referee was distracted by their fight. This allowed Sullivan to perform a Chair Shot on Animal. Sullivan and Williams continued to dominate Animal. Hawk was tagged in. Road Warriors tried to perform a Doomsday Device, but Williams broke it up. Animal fought Williams while Hawk performed a Flying Clothesline on Sullivan to win the match and retain the titles.\n\nThe main event featured Ric Flair defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat. Steamboat got the early momentum until Flair began attacking Steamboat. Flair performed a Jumping Knee Drop on Steamboat. Steamboat whipped Flair and Flair did a Flair Flip onto the apron. He climbed the top rope and delivered a Diving Crossbody to Steamboat but Steamboat countered it into a pinfall. Flair delivered an Inverted Atomic Drop to Steamboat and followed a Figure Four Leglock. Flair began attacking Steamboat's knee. Steamboat eventually gained momentum by performing a Clothesline. Steamboat tried to deliver a Diving Crossbody on Flair but the referee was hit as well. Steamboat tried to wake up the referee. Flair took advantage and tried to pin Steamboat with a Roll-up. Flair tossed Steamboat over the top rope and Steamboat climbed the top rope to perform a Diving Crossbody but Flair moved out of the way. Teddy Long came in as the replacement referee. Flair tried to apply a Figure Four Leglock on Steamboat but Steamboat countered it with a Small Package to pin Flair to win the title.\n\nRicky Steamboat and Ric Flair continued their rivalry for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Chi-Town Rumble. On April 2 \"\", Steamboat defeated Flair in a Two out of three falls match to retain the title. However, Flair's foot was on the bottom rope during the ending of the third fall. As a result, it was announced on April 9 edition of \"Main Event\" that a rematch would take place between the two for the title. At WrestleWar, Flair defeated Steamboat to win the title.\n\nAfter winning the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship from Barry Windham at Chi-Town Rumble, Lex Luger continued his feud with Windham. On March 18 edition of \"World Championship Wrestling\", Luger and Michael Hayes competed against Barry and Kendall Windham in a tag team match, during which Hayes turned on Luger and helped the Windhams in winning the match. As a result, Hayes joined Hiro Matsuda's group Yamazaki Corporation and began a rivalry with Luger. At WrestleWar, Hayes defeated Luger, with the help of Terry Gordy to win the United States Championship.\n\nThe Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal) continued their rivalry with The Varsity Club after retaining the NWA World Tag Team Championship against Club members Kevin Sullivan and Steve Williams at Chi-Town Rumble. On April 2 \"Clash of the Champions VI\", Road Warriors lost the belts to Club members Mike Rotunda and Steve Williams. At WrestleWar, Rotunda and Williams defended the titles against Road Warriors. Club members Kevin Sullivan and Dan Spivey attacked the special guest referee Nikita Koloff, resulting in a disqualification loss for Rotunda and Williams. This misconduct between Club members caused the titles to get vacated.\n\n"}
{"id": "1912788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912788", "title": "Pavel Schilling", "text": "Pavel Schilling\n\nBaron Pavel Lvovitch Schilling (1786–1837), also known as Paul Schilling, was a Russian military officer and diplomat of Baltic German origin. The majority of his career was spent working for the imperial Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a language officer at the Russian embassy in Munich. As a military officer, he took part in the War of the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. In his later career, he was transferred to the Asian department of the ministry and undertook a tour of Mongolia to collect ancient manuscripts.\n\nSchilling is best known for his pioneering work in electrical telegraphy, which he undertook at his own initiative. While he was in Munich, he worked with Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring who was developing an electrochemical telegraph. Schilling developed the first electromagnetic telegraph that was of practical use. Schilling's design was a needle telegraph using magnetised needles suspended by a thread over a current-carrying coil. His design also greatly reduced the number of wires compared to Sömmerring's system by the use of binary coding. Tsar Nicholas I planned to install Schilling's telegraph on a link to Kronstadt, but cancelled the project after Schilling died.\n\nOther technological interests of Schilling included lithography, remote detonation of explosives, and submarine cables.\n\nBaron Pavel Lvovitch Schilling von Cannstadt was born in Reval (now Tallinn), Estonia, on 16 April 1786 (N.S.). He was an ethnic German, but a Russian citizen as Estonia was then part of the Russian Empire. His father was L. F. Schilling, commander of the 23rd Nizovsk infantry regiment, and Pavel was the eldest of four children. He was expected to follow a military career like his father, so he was sent to First Cadet Corps at the age of eleven. On graduating as a subaltern, he was posted to a unit commanded by F. I. Schubert and assigned cartographical surveying duties.\n\nFamily circumstances obliged Schilling to resign his commission in 1803. He then joined the foreign service as a language officer. He was an attaché to the Russian embassy in Munich from 1809 to 1811. He first became interested in electrical science while he was in Munich through contact with Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring who was developing an electrical telegraph. His duties as a diplomat were light. He was left him with time on his hands, much of which he spent with Sömmerring, and he brought many Russian dignitaries to see Sömmerring's apparatus.\n\nWar threatened between France and Russia, so Schilling put his mind to applying his electrical knowledge to military purposes. He devised a water resistant conducting wire that could be laid in wet earth or through rivers. It consisted of a copper wire insulated with a mixture of India-rubber and varnish. Schilling had in mind the military use of telegraphy in the field for this invention. He also thought it would be useful for exploding mines at a distance. Schilling became very excitable about the latter idea. Sömmerring wrote in his diary \"Schilling is quite childish about his electro-conducting cord.\"\n\nSchilling, along with all Russian diplomats in Germany, was recalled to St. Petersburg in 1812 as the impending French invasion of Russia loomed. There he continued his work on mine detonation. He used an electric spark across charcoal points (electrodes ending in a sharp point) connected to the end of his cable. He experimentally set off explosions across the Neva River and later, during the occupation of Paris in 1814, across the Seine. He once took the end of an igniter cable into the Tsar's tent while on campaign and invited him to touch the wires together. The resulting distant explosion surprised everyone and earned Schilling a round of applause.\n\nSchilling requested a military position and on 6 September 1813 he was posted to the 3rd Sumsk dragoons with the rank of staff captain. He remained in the regiment throughout the War of the Sixth Coalition and saw action at Arcis-sur-Aube (20–21 February 1814), Fere-Champenoise (25 February), Bar-sur-Aube (27 February), and the final close on Paris (30 March). He was awarded a military medal and a sword inscribed \"for valour\".\n\nSchilling returned to his duties in Munich in 1815. He continued to take an interest in electricity, and also in lithography, a new method of printing which he wished to introduce into Russia. He met with Alois Senefelder, the inventor of the lithographic process, in 1816, and later founded a large lithographic printing establishment in Russia after he was appointed Director of Lithography at the ministry. Schilling set up an electrical engineering workshop in the Peter and Paul Fortress. He recruited Moritz von Jacobi from Dorpat University to act as his assistant there. In March 1818, Schilling was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Anna.\n\nThe government wished to strengthen ties with eastern neighbours. Schilling was transferred to the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of this movement. In 1828 Schilling was made a State Councillor and he became a corresponding member of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In May 1830, he was sent on a two-year mission to Mongolia (then part of China), tasked with searching for rare manuscripts. He returned to St. Petersburg in March 1832, bringing with him a valuable collection of documents in Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian and other languages. These were deposited in the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. Some of these documents were obtained in exchange for a demonstration of the small telegraph apparatus Schilling had carried with him. Back in St. Petersburg, Schilling returned to developing a telegraph. There were plans to put it into service, but Schilling died before these could be completed.\n\nSchilling first became involved in telegraphy while he was in Munich. He assisted Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring with his experiments with an electrochemical telegraph. This form of telegraph uses electricity to cause a chemical reaction at the far end, such as bubbles forming in a glass tube of acid. After returning to St. Petersburg he conducted his own experiments with this type of telegraph. He demonstrated his version to Tsar Alexander I in 1812, but Alexander I declined to take it up. The Tsar went even further, and forbade all research and publications on electrical telegraphy as a revolutionary idea.\n\nWhen Schilling learned of Hans Christian Ørsted's discovery in 1820 that electric current could deflect compass needles, he decided to switch investigation into needle telegraphs, that is, telegraphs that used Ørsted's principle. A new Tsar, Nicholas I, ascended the throne in 1825. He was more receptive to new technology than Alexander I. Schilling used from one to six needles in various demonstrations to represent letters of the alphabet or other information. He took a single-needle instrument with him for demonstration purposes on his journey to Mongolia. When he returned, Schilling used a binary code on his telegraph with multiple needles, inspired by \"I Ching\" hexagrams which he had become familiar with in Mongolia. These hexagrams are figures used in divination, each of which consist of a figure of six stacked lines. Each line can be solid or broken, two binary states, leading to a total of 64 figures. The six units of the \"I Ching\" fitted in perfectly with the six needles he needed to code the Russian alphabet. This was the first use of binary coding in telecommunications, predating the Baudot code by several decades.\n\nOn 21 October 1832 (O.S.), Schilling set up a demonstration of his six-needle telegraph between two rooms in his apartment building about 100 metres apart. To get the space to demonstrate a credible distance, he hired the entire floor of the building and ran a mile and a half of wire around the building. The demonstration was so popular that it stayed open until the Christmas break. Notable visitors included Nicholas I (who had already seen an earlier version in April 1830), Moritz von Jacobi, Alexander von Benckendorff, and Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich. A ten-word message in French was dictated by the Tsar and successfully sent over the apparatus. Alexander von Humboldt, after seeing Schilling's telegraph demonstrated in Berlin, recommended to the Tsar that a telegraph should be built in Russia.\n\nIn May 1835 he began a tour of Europe demonstrating a one-needle instrument. He conducted experiments in Vienna with other scientists, including an investigation into the relative merits of rooftop and buried cables. The buried cable was not successful because his thin India rubber and varnish insulation was inadequate. In September he was at a meeting in Bonn where Georg Wilhelm Muncke saw the instrument. Muncke had a copy made for use in his lectures. In 1835, Schilling demonstrated a five-needle telegraph to the German Physical Society in Frankfurt. By the time Schilling returned to Russia, his telegraph was well known throughout Europe and was frequently discussed in the scientific literature. In September 1836, the British government offered to buy the rights to the telegraph but Schilling declined, wishing to use it to pursue telegraphy in Russia.\n\nIn 1836, Nicholas I created a commission of inquiry to advise on installation of Schilling's telegraph between Kronstadt, an important naval base, and Peterhof Palace. Prince Alexander Menshikov, the Minister of Marine, was appointed president of the commission. Schilling offered two schemes to the commission. One was to lay a submarine cable across the Gulf of Finland. The wires were to be insulated with varnished silk, bound together, and the whole assembly tarred. The other option was to suspend the wires on poles along the Peterhof Road.\n\nAn experimental line was set up in the Admiralty building running from a room near the grand entrance to Menshikov's study in the northwest corner with telegraph equipment at each end. The line was partly overground and partly submerged in the canal. Menshikov submitted a favourable report and Nicholas I issued a decree in May 1837 ordering the installation of a submarine cable to Kronstadt. Schilling took the project as far as ordering the submarine cable from a rope factory in St. Petersburg, but he died on 6 August (N.S.), and the project was subsequently cancelled.\n\nSchilling is sometimes credited with being the first to devise a code for a single-wire telegraph, but there is some doubt about how many needles he used and at what dates. It may be that Schilling used a single-needle-only setup on demonstrations around Europe merely for ease of transport, or it may have been a later design inspired by the Gauss and Weber telegraph, in which case he would not have been the first. The code alleged to have been used with this telegraph can be traced to Alfred Vail, but the variable-length code (like Morse code) given by Vail is merely shown as an example of how it could be used. In any case, two-element signalling alphabets predate any form of electrical telegraphy by some time. According to Hubbard, it is more likely that Schilling used the same code as used on the six-needle telegraph, but with the bits sent serially instead of in parallel.\n\nSchilling looked into the possibility of automatic recording of telegraph signals, but could not make it work due to the complexity of the device. His electrical engineering successor, Jacobi, succeeded in doing this in 1841 on a telegraph line from the Winter Palace to the General Staff Headquarters.\n\nThe Schilling needle telegraph, as such, was never used, but it is partly the ancestor of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, a system widely used in the United Kingdom and British Empire in the nineteenth century, and some instruments remained in use well into the twentieth century. Schilling's demonstration in Frankfurt was attended by Georg Wilhelm Muncke who subsequently had an exact copy of Schilling's apparatus made. Muncke used this for demonstrations in lectures. One of these lectures was attended by William Fothergill Cooke, who was inspired to build a version of Schilling's telegraph of his own, although he did not realise that the instrument he saw was due to Schilling. He abandoned this method for practical use in favour of electromagnetic clockwork solutions for a while, apparently believing that needle telegraphs always required multiple wires. That Schilling's method of suspending the needle by a thread horizontally was not very convenient was also an influence. This changed when he partnered with Charles Wheatstone and the telegraph they then built together was a multiple-needle telegraph, but with a rather more robust mounting based on the galvanometer of Macedonio Melloni. There is no evidence for the claim sometimes advanced that Wheatstone also lectured with a copy of Schilling's telegraph, although he certainly knew about it and lectured on its implications.\n\nSchilling's telegraph of 1832 is currently displayed in the telegraph collection of the A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications. The instrument was previously on exhibition at the Paris Electrical Exhibition of 1881. His contributions to electrical telegraphy were named an IEEE Milestone in 2009. The building housing his apartment in St. Petersburg, then known as Ofrosimova's house, but now 7 Marsovue Pole, has a memorial plaque, placed in 1886 to mark the centennial of his birth.\n\n"}

The show was made using computer generated imagery (CGI) rendered in cel shading. It ran for only one season of 13 episodes, premiering on July 11, 2003, and was broadcast on MTV and YTV.\n\nAs of October 13, 2018, Viceland picked up the series for syndication, making it the first time the series has been aired on television in fifteen years.\n\nThe story follows the events of the first \"Spider-Man\" film. Norman Osborn is dead. Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn attend Empire State University. Peter and Mary Jane try to establish a relationship without success. Peter's superhero duties, and later his involvement with Indira Daimonji, interfere with his romance with Mary Jane. Harry craves revenge on Spider-Man, whom he blames for the death of his father. Peter faces an assortment of other villains including the Lizard, Kraven the Hunter and Electro while trying to maintain a job and his studies. He faces two psychic twins that ruin everything in the wallcrawler's life, causing Peter to give up being Spider-Man and try to live a normal life.\n\n\n\n\"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series\" was initially supposed to be an adaptation of the \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" comics. However, after the success of \"Spider-Man\", the show was reworked to follow that continuity. The series was produced by Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote on \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" comics, for Sony Pictures Television, who had purchased the film and television rights to the character. The computer-generated imagery (CGI) was produced by Mainframe Entertainment.\n\nPeter Parker was originally supposed to wear baggier clothes to hide his superhero musculature, but cost-effective difficulties with the CG format prevented folds from being put into his everyday attire. As a result, Peter's street clothes were redesigned to be close-fitting and contemporary, while still managing to hide his physique (and the costume he wore under his clothes) as Spider-Man. The character of Aunt May was not included in the series (except for a photograph in Peter's bedroom), because MTV executives feared that the appearance of any elderly people would deter their target youth audience from watching.\n\nThe producers found that the more relaxed standards of MTV allowed them more creative freedom than usually allowed for a Saturday morning cartoon show.\n\nMTV decided that the ratings for the series were insufficient to warrant a second season, leaving the series to end on a cliffhanger. Director Brandon Vietti stated that had the series gone on he would have used the villains Mysterio, Vulture, and more of Kraven.\n\nDue to various production delays, the episodes aired on MTV out of the correct scripted order. This caused some confusion with audiences regarding the chronology of the series. The DVD releases feature the episodes in the correct order. Each episode has a montage at the end of which states \"Next Time On \"Spider-Man\"\". The order given here is that of the DVD.\nThe series received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences, with praise aimed at the voice acting, Neil Patrick Harris' portrayal of Spider-Man, the considerably mature, darker and adult-oriented tone, writing and direction compared to other animated Spider-Man adaptations, the series' potential, quality CGI animation, techno/synthwave-influenced soundtrack, the darker re-imagining and modifications to classic Spider-Man villains (E.G-The Lizard and Electro) and the unique and refreshing, yet faithful take on the Spider-Man mythos, though the abrupt cliffhanger ending and divergence from the later Sam Raimi-directed Spider-Man films received criticism from fans.\n\nIn 2004, the series was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Production while \"Keeping Secrets\" got a nomination in Outstanding Storyboarding in an Animated Television Production.\n\nThe complete series was released on DVD as \"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series: Special Edition\" on January 13, 2004. Four separate DVD volumes containing three episodes each were also released from 2004 to 2005.

It uses the same diameter bullet (usually not the same weight) as the .270 Winchester hunting cartridge.\n\nThe 6.8mm SPC cartridge was designed to address the deficiencies of the terminal ballistics of the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge currently in service with the Armed Forces of all NATO aligned countries. The cartridge was the result of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge program. The 6.8 SPC (6.8×43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray, a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith, to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an M16 pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil. The goal was to create a cartridge that would bridge the gap between 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm.\n\nThe program started the design by using a .30 Remington case, which was modified in length to fit into magazines that would be accommodated by the magazine wells of the M16 family of rifles and carbines that are currently in service with the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nIn tests comparing various caliber bullets, Holland and Murray determined that a 6.5 mm caliber projectile had the best accuracy and penetration, with historical data going back for decades of US Army exterior and terminal ballistic testing, but a 7 mm projectile had the best terminal performance. The combination of the cartridge case, powder load, and projectile easily outperformed the 7.62×39mm and 5.45×39mm Soviet cartridge, with the new cartridge proving to be about faster than the 7.62 NATO. The resulting cartridge was named the 6.8 Remington Special Purpose Cartridge due to the .270\" (6.8 mm) diameter projectile and the fact that it was based on the .30 Remington case.\n\nIn general, adapting an AR-style rifle to the new cartridge only requires the replacement of the barrel, bolt, magazine & muzzle device (if applicable) of the 5.56 mm-chambered rifle; but to further streamline and simplify the conversion process many parts manufacturers sell complete upper receiver assemblies chambered for 6.8 SPC. While a complete 6.8 SPC assembly is a somewhat more expensive route, the conversion of an existing 5.56 mm/.223 rifle to 6.8 SPC using a complete upper assembly takes less than a minute on an AR-style rifle without the need for specialized tools or skills.\n\nThe 6.8mm Remington SPC was designed to perform better in short barreled CQB rifles after diminished performance from the 5.56 NATO when the M16A2 was changed from the rifle configuration to the current M4 carbine. The 6.8 SPC delivers 44% more energy than the 5.56mm NATO (M4 configuration) at . The 6.8 mm SPC is not the ballistic equal of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge, but it has less recoil, has been said to be more controllable in rapid fire, and is lighter, allowing operators to carry more ammunition than would otherwise be possible with the larger caliber round. The 6.8 mm generates around of muzzle energy with a bullet. In comparison, the 5.56×45mm round (which the 6.8 is designed to replace) generates around with a bullet, giving the 6.8 mm a terminal ballistic advantage over the 5.56 mm of .\nOne of the enigmatic features of this cartridge is its being designed for a short barrel carbine length rifle than the standard rifle length is (usually ). The round only gains about for every 25 mm of barrel length past the standard barrel (all else being equal) up to barrel's length around with no gain/loss in accuracy. It also does very well in rifles with less than barrels. In recent developments (the period 2008-2012) the performance of the 6.8 SPC has been increased by approximately by the work of one ammunition manufacturer Silver State Armory LLC (SSA) and a few custom rifle builders using/designing the correct chamber and barrel specifications. The 6.8mm Remington SPC cartridge weighs depending on the manufacturer and load between . Also, more recently, LWRC, Magpul and Alliant Techsystems (ATK) are currently introducing a new AR-15 designed for the 6.8 SPC which allows for a proprietary 6.8 Magpul P-Mags and an overall cartridge length of . The Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) known as the Six8 is SPC II w 1: twist and is able to use all current 6.8 SPC factory ammunition. See Gold Dot below for ATK's part.\n\n\n\nTypical trajectory information from carbines with drop and velocity calculated at sea level with a zero.\n\nWhen the LWRC Six8 was being developed, Alliant Techsystems was contracted to develop a new 6.8×43mm round for the weapon. Unlike smaller commercial firms, ATK is a large ammunition supplier that delivers products for the U.S. Army, so it had large resources and manufacturing capabilities at its disposal. Commercial cartridges varied in case capacity and thickness, but LWRC wanted a thick and durable case for military uses. A load was developed specifically for a high muzzle velocity and low felt recoil from the Six8's barrel. Effective range would be over and the bullet would still have enough energy to penetrate intermediate barriers. Three 90 gr loads were constructed for testing that included Gold Dot, Monolithic Hollow Point, and FMJ. The Gold Dot bullet was selected with a jacket and a bonded core. The propellant was designed for reduced muzzle flash stable performance at temperatures between -29.2 to 125.6 degrees F. Muzzle velocity averaged at a difference at the required temperature extremes from the 8.5 in barrel. From a barrel, the round produced a group of at .\n\nBy late 2004 the 6.8×43mm SPC was said to be performing well in the field against enemy combatants in Special Operations. However the cartridge was not used by conventional US military personnel. It was not adopted for widespread use due to resistance from officials. The 6.8 SPC was designed for better terminal effectiveness at the shorter ranges of urban combat experienced in Iraq. When fighting in Afghanistan began to intensify, engagements began taking place at greater distances, where 6.8 SPC begins to falter. Experiments suggested that the comparatively short 6.8 mm bullets became ineffective at longer ranges. In 2007, both the U.S. SOCOM and the U.S. Marine Corps decided not to field weapons chambered in 6.8 mm due to logistical and cost issues. An unnamed LWRC representative said in January 2014 that the US military is once again taking a look at the 6.8 SPCII after all the commercial development in the last 10 years.\n\nWhile there are many rumors of evaluations of the cartridge by several major Federal and local law enforcement agencies, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has allowed individual agents to purchase the M6A2 D-DEA - which uses the 6.8mm Remington SPC - as an authorized alternative to their duty weapon. In 2010 the Jordanian state-owned arms manufacturer KADDB announced that they would be producing 6.8 mm rifles and carbines for the Jordanian Army. There is also a contract between LWRC, Magpul, Alliant Techsystems and The Saudi Royal guard for around 36,000 Six8 PDWs & undisclosed amount of ATK/Federal XD68GD (90gr Gold Dot 'training' ammo) and proprietary Magpul 6.8 Pmags specifically for the LWRC Six8. See above under the subsection 'Development' Section.\nThe 6.8 is also being produced in a Squad Automatic Weapon or SAW by U.S. Machine Gun Armory. The MGA SAW™ is fully compatible with the United States Department of Defense model designations: M249 and MK46. It is currently being shipped to US allies and is under testing with the US military.\n\nThere are several different chambers for the 6.8 SPC which yield different results. They are:\n\n\nOnly the rifles chambered with the newer specified chamber (6.8mm Spec II, Noveske Mod 1, 6.8 ARP, and 6.8 Bison chambers) can safely use the higher pressure military/tactical and near max-maximum handloaded ammunition. Those rifles using the Original SAAMI specs should only be used with the standard commercial cartridge pressure (Specified by SAAMI).\n\nSeveral twist rates are available for 6.8 SPC barrels. The slowest twist rates are approximately 1:12\", while twist rates between 1:9.5\" and 1:11\" are common. The de facto standard twist rate for 6.8 SPC is currently 1:11\". Bison Armory employs a twist rate of 1:7\" in some of their 16\" and shorter barrels in order to stabilize 180 to 200 grain bullets for subsonic performance similar to the 300 AAC Blackout.\n\nThe first major manufacturer to offer a 6.8mm Remington SPC chambered version of the AR-15 was Barrett Firearms Company, offering the Barrett M468 and later the REC7. By 2007, most major manufacturers of AR-15 type rifles for the civilian gun market were offering rifles in this caliber. Dedicated AR upper receiver assemblies chambered for the round are produced by a number of smaller firms, including Daniel Defense. Ruger Firearms no longer produces a 6.8 mm for their Ruger SR-556 piston-driven AR-15 variant. The Stag Arms Hunter and Tactical models utilize the newer chamber(SPC II) and specified twist rates to accommodate higher pressure loadings, as well as upper receivers in Left-Handed configurations. Rock River Arms has a LAR-6.8 X Series rifle and uppers. Microtech Small Arms Research offers their version of the Steyr AUG in 6.8. Robinson Armament Co. offers the XCR-L in 6.8, which can be easily converted between 6.8, 5.56, and 7.62×39. Bushmaster has delivered a 6.8 SPC II conversion kit to the market as of October 2018. Ruger Firearms chambered their Mini-14 Ranch Rifle in this round for several years; however, it has been discontinued.\n\nAs of 2019, no significant firearms companies are producing a manual action firearm in 6.8 SPC. Remington used to make a bolt-action rifle chambered for 6.8 SPC, a barrel Model 700 but this item is not currently available from Remington. Ruger no longer produces their M77 Hawkeye Compact rifle with a barrel weighing in at . Browning has discontinued their A-Bolt rifles in all calibers including the formerly available 6.8 SPC. Thompson/Center has offered barrels chambered for 6.8 SPC for the Encore and Contender G2.\n\n\n"}

Parker, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), is a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that interpreted the Takings Clause (\"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\") of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court voted 8–0 to hold that private property could be taken for a public purpose with just compensation. The case laid the foundation for the Court's later important public use cases, \"Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff\", 467 U.S. 229 (1984) and \"Kelo v. City of New London\", 545 U.S. 469 (2005).\n\nCritics of recent occurrences of eminent domain uses trace what they view as property rights violations to this case.\n\nThe United States Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act of 1945 to address the vast blighted area found in the District of Columbia. The Act created a commission of five members called the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency and granted it the power to redevelop blighted areas and eliminate any \"blighting factors or causes of blight.\" The act granted the Agency the power of eminent domain, if necessary, to transfer private property from the original owner to a private entity to serve the public purpose of redevelopment. The Act was not only concerned with clearing slums but also with modernizing the urban environment.\n\nThe first project under the Act was Project Area B in Southwest Washington, D.C. In 1950, a comprehensive plan for the area was published after surveys indicated that in that area, \"64.3% of the dwellings were beyond repair, 18.4% needed major repairs, only 17.3% were satisfactory; 57.8% of the dwellings had outside toilets, 60.3% had no baths, 29.6% lacked electricity, 82.2% had no wash basins or laundry tubs, 83.8% lacked central heating.\" The plan made provisions for the types of dwelling units and provided that \"at least one-third of them [were] to be low-rent housing with a maximum rental of $17 per room per month.\" The plan was approved by the Commissioners and the Agency began redevelopment of the area. It was during the beginning stages of this redevelopment that the plaintiffs brought suit to challenge the constitutionality of the taking of their department store, located at 712 Fourth Street, S.W. in Area B.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case owned a department store that was not itself blighted but that was scheduled to be taken by eminent domain in order to clear the larger blighted area where it was located. Plaintiffs argued that this property was not slum housing and that it could not be taken for a project under the management of a private agency to be redeveloped for private use simply to make the community more attractive overall. The owners further argued that taking the land under eminent domain and giving it to redevelopers amounted to \"a taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman\" and did not constitute a public use, thus violating the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nBerman's challenge to the constitutionality of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act was heard by a special three-judge panel district court. The key issue addressed was the government's ability and scope to take and transfer private property to private developers as part of a project to clear blight from an entire area.\n\nE. Barrett Prettyman, the D.C. Circuit judge who wrote the opinion, found no problem with the government's use of eminent domain to clear blighted structures because it could be seen as the abatement of a public nuisance.\n\nHowever, Judge Prettyman saw the land on which the blighted structures were located as a different matter and as having nothing inherently to do with blight. Such land, he felt, could be taken by eminent domain only if it actually helped to combat the blight that existed on the property.\n\nJudge Prettyman ultimately read the Redevelopment Act very narrowly and found that non-blighted property could be taken if the taking could be tied to prevention of blight. He firmly stated, however, that eminent domain could not be used by the government to take private property for the purpose of improving economic or aesthetic conditions of neighborhoods.\n\nTherefore, he granted the government's motion to dismiss but also raised the seriousness of using eminent domain to serve broad redevelopment projects.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously decided in favor of the Planning Commission by arguing that the problem of large-scale blight needed to be addressed by a large-scale integrated redevelopment plan. Justice Douglas wrote, \"If owner after owner were permitted to resist these redevelopment programs on the ground that his particular property was not being used against the public interest, integrated plans for redevelopment would suffer greatly.\"\n\nAs the Planning Commission had made detailed plans and taken extensive surveys of the area in question, the Supreme Court argued for judicial restraint. Douglas wrote, \"In the present case, the Congress and its authorized agencies have made determinations that take into account a wide variety of values. It is not for us to reappraise them.\"\n\nThe Court stated that the Fifth Amendment had nothing to prohibit those who govern the District of Columbia from deciding that the Capital should be \"beautiful as well as sanitary.\"\n\nAs the object of cleaning up the area was said to be within Congress's authority, the Court found a clear right to use eminent domain to accomplish the object.\n\nDouglas addressed the issue presented by the landowners of \"a taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman\" by saying that a legitimate public purpose had been established by the Congress in creating the entire redevelopment plan: the purpose of the taking was to eliminate slums on an area-wide basis. Specific parcels of land may have been unblighted, but the Court found that their taking was necessary for the functioning of the redevelopment plan as a whole.\n\nJustice Douglas expanded the definition of \"public use\" to include \"public purpose\" based on physical, aesthetic, and monetary benefits; he stated that the purpose of the redevelopment plan was to address the broader blight issues in the area to prevent the neighborhood from reverting to the blighted conditions.\n\nThe Court ultimately declined to address the specifics of the plan: \"Once the question of the public purpose has been decided, the amount and character of the land to be taken for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch.\"\n\nThe judgment of the District Court was affirmed, but the Supreme Court opinion made it clear that Judge Prettyman's narrow reading of the Act was improper.\n\n\"Berman\" was reexamined in \"Kelo v. City of New London\" (2005) in which the Court extended the \"Berman\" ruling to allow takings of unblighted private property that were solely for the economic benefit of the condemnor-city. In 1984, the Court had held in \"Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff\" (1984) that redistribution of land from some private parties to other private parties could pass constitutional muster as a means of rectifying what the state legislature found to be an oligopoly in fee simple land titles.\n\nThe legislation upheld by the Supreme Court in \"Berman\" provided that inasmuch as the taking of land in the project area would displace a large impoverished, slum-dwelling population, in the new [re]development of that area, at least a third of new dwellings would be required to rent for $17 per room per month. However, after the \"Berman\" decision came down, that provision was repealed. Similarly, in Hawaii, the taking of the land lessor's interest was supposed to reduce or stabilize housing prices on Oahu. However, after the \"Midkiff\" decision, housing prices on Oahu skyrocketed upward, doubling in about five years. Many of the homes in the taking area, notably in the Kahala area, were bought up by Japanese investors who tore them down and replaced them with luxury homes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1912837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912837", "title": "Melbourne High School", "text": "Melbourne High School\n\nMelbourne High School is a government-funded single-sex academically selective secondary day school for boys, located in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra, Victoria, Australia. Established in 1905, the school caters for boys from Year 9 to Year 12 and is known mainly for its strong academic reputation. \n\nMelbourne High School had the leading rank based on VCE average, with its 2009 cohort achieving a median ATAR of 95.85, the highest of any Victorian school in recorded history. Students have achieved very strong results in the VCE examinations, and placements at tertiary institutions are at a rate well above Victoria's average. The school has a compulsory involvement program, including involvement within school and within the broader community. Its ethos encourages investment of effort into academic, sporting, musical, leadership, and personal pursuits. It was also the first school in Australia to establish a Student Representative Council, with the assistance of Sir Robert Menzies. In addition, the school owns an outdoor education facility in Millgrove, which lies near the Warburton ranges. Throughout this history, enrolment for year 9 has been determined by an entrance examination, held in June each year. The entrance examination consists of an assessment of the applicant's mathematics and English skills. In 2007, 308 Year 9s entered the school, out of over 1,200 students who undertook the examination.\n\nThe school was founded in 1905 as the first co-educational state secondary school in Victoria. Melbourne High School was originally located in Spring Street in Melbourne. In 1927, the boys and girls split, with the boys moving to a new school at Forrest Hill in the inner city suburb of South Yarra which retained the name Melbourne High School. The girls eventually moved to the Mac.Robertson Girls' High School on Kings Way, Melbourne. \n\nIn 2010, \"The Age\" reported that Melbourne High School ranked equal tenth among Australian schools based on the number of alumni who had received a top Order of Australia honour.\n\nUnder controversial circumstances arising from the opposition of private schools, on 15 February 1905, Frank Tate, the first Director of Education, established Victoria's first state secondary school, the Melbourne Continuation School, with 135 girls and 68 boys. Tate's motivation for establishing the school was to allow students from state primary schools to continue their education, which would otherwise have ended if they could not afford to enrol at one of Melbourne's private schools.\n\nThe school's original campus was that of the Old National Model School in Spring Street, Melbourne. Joseph Hocking, an inspector of schools, was named the first principal, emerging from a large number of varied applications for the job. Hocking followed Tate's vision and moulded the school to produce students of high quality as evidenced by their final year results.\n\nBy 1919, it had the greatest number of students at Melbourne University (then Victoria's only university) from any school.\n\nSport, music, cadets, the school magazine and social events became important areas of the school. In 1910, the first sporting exchange with Adelaide High School occurred. This was later followed by an exchange with North Sydney Boys' High School.\n\nIn 1914, with the school just nine years old, the school's growth and development was disrupted by World War I, in which over 500 Melbourne High students served. The school has since developed a special association with Anzac Cove, sending cadets and students to participate in ANZAC Day ceremonies every year. \n\nHocking spoke of the students as:\n\nThe school's growth soon resumed, but the building they occupied was beginning to feel dilapidated. In the 1920s, it was announced that the school would split and the boys and girls would move to alternative locations.\n\nIn October 1927, the boys moved to Forrest Hill in South Yarra and formed Melbourne Boys' High School. The old campus was renamed Melbourne Girls' High School.\n\nBetween 1931–34, the girls of the old Melbourne Continuation School moved from Government House, to the King Street Central School and finally to Albert Park, renaming the school as the Mac.Robertson Girls' High School.\n\nThe boys’ new campus at Forrest Hill soon developed and traditions like the house competition began. The Depression did not prevent the expansion of the Forrest Hill campus and sporting facilities. \n\nOld traditions in music and debating continued, with the addition of house chorals, which is now an important event in the school calendar.\n\nNew traditions emerged, such as a house system, with competition in various sports, debating and, with the strong music tradition of the school, house chorals. A Memorial Hall paid for by past students was a feature of the new school.\n\nJust as had occurred in World War I, World War II disrupted the school's proceedings greatly. The school building itself was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy. The students of the school moved to either the new Camberwell High School or the Tooronga Road State School. It was only in 1944 that students returned to Forrest Hill under the new principal Major-General (later Sir) Alan Ramsay. Ramsay was the first 'Old Boy', or former student, to become principal. Since then, all but one of his successors have been Old Boys.\n\nIn the 1950s, Brigadier George Langley set up reviving the school, laying down the plans for a swimming pool and physical education centre while also reestablishing the Tecoma camp. This led to an upgrade in the school's facilities. In 1960, the physical education centre and swimming pool opened. In 1965, a new library was established. In 1968, portable classrooms were built. In 1970, the Junior Science Block was opened.\n\nIn the 1980s, the ageing buildings needed refurbishment and new facilities were needed to meet the rapidly changing demands of a modern education, most notably the need for computers. Neville Drohan, principal from 1987–91, combined government funding with donations from the school community to construct a new four-storey building: the ‘Nineties’ building (see facilities below).\n\nIn 1992, Raymond Willis became principal and in 1995 oversaw a full refurbishment of the original building dating from 1927, including the addition of a computer suite, dark room, a new general office, improved classroom, a conference room, the heritage room and an upgraded canteen and dining area. \n\nThe original grass hockey field was replaced with a synthetic one and, next to the hockey field, two plexipave basketball courts were built.\n\nThe school oval was the next to be revamped. In 1999, new turf wickets which would be maintained by a curator were added, along with new drainage and watering as well as an upgrade to the lighting. The new oval was given the name of the Woodfull-Miller Oval in honour of Bill Woodfull, a former student and principal, and Keith Miller, another former student, both highly regarded Australian test cricketers.\n\nWillis continued to upgrade the school's facilities with the construction of an cardio room in the Nineties building, and the addition of four junior science classrooms.\n\nThe Army Cadets and Air Force Cadets received a new building in 2002, a building which included orderly rooms, meeting rooms, seminar rooms, display areas, kitchen and toilets. In 2002, new change rooms were also constructed in the Old Boys Pavilion, along with the construction of a new hockey pavilion overlooking the synthetic hockey field.\n\nThe expansion had other ramifications. The school now had extra space and, as a result, increased its enrolment to a new high of 1,366. This meant a lower cutoff in the entrance exam, which led to the school's median ENTER dropping to second in the state. The median only returned to first place again in 2009 (see Academics).\n\nAfter making numerous innovative changes and advancements, Ray Willis died in July 2004 as the school's longest serving principal and the school went into a state of mourning.\n\nIn January 2005, Jeremy Ludowyke was appointed principal. In 2007 a new Arts Centre began construction and after nearly two years was officially opened by major donator and 'old boy' Lindsay Fox (who was asked to leave).\n\nIn 2007, Year Ten students were assigned to produce their own 'Citizenship Statement'. The results were collated to create an official 'MHS Citizenship Statement' that details the school's expectations of its students and now appears in the student planner.\n\nThe school admits that it is primarily seen as an academic school, but it also has a wide range of co-curricular traditions of music, with massed singing, formal assemblies and speech nights, the house sporting competition, house choral competition, Army and Air Force cadet corps, current affairs groups and school sports.\n\nMelbourne High School is the only state school for boys in Victoria which selects students solely on the basis of performance in an entrance examination. Every year, well over 1,400 boys try to obtain a place in Year 9 by undertaking the examination in the Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton. These placements are based on their raw results in the entrance exam. Those who were within 5 marks of the cut-off-score or did not receive a place due to the \"5% rule\", which prevents more than 5% of another school's cohort entering Melbourne High, are asked to participate in the Principal's Discretionary Category.\n\nUsually 180 students are eligible to apply in this category and compete for just 15 allocated places. Students choosing to participate follow a complete application process involving:\n\nA small number of students are then short-listed and interviewed. 15 of the shortlisted are then chosen to be given offers into the school. Places are also available in year 10 but the competition is much fiercer; in 2007, 28 students were accepted into Year 10; in 2008, only 29 students were accepted after undergoing a similar process to the Principals Discretionary Category. Fewer places again are available at year 11, these places being given based on an interview and application form. No further enrolment is available in year 12. \n\nThe rules for entry are equal for all students during \"examination entry\" into the school. Students who live in the nearby area are not treated any differently from those from outer suburbs or regional areas.\n\nPast students have achieved very strong results in the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) examinations, and the median ENTER for Melbourne High School in 2009 was 95.85, the highest ever and the highest median ENTER by any school in Victoria barring its sister school, Mac.Robertson Girls' High School. Over 99% of students pursue a tertiary education, and the school has the largest intake into Monash University and the University of Melbourne out of all schools.\n\nMelbourne High School has been ranked second out of all state secondary schools in Victoria based on the median ENTER achieved by its students since 2001 (before which it was ranked first, but had a lower enrolment), only coming second to Mac.Robertson Girls' High School.\n\nIn 2009, it ended its 7-year drought by achieving higher average VCE results than Mac.Robertson Girls'. A summary of the school's academic results up until 2009, a year which principal Jeremy Ludowyke termed as \"far and away the best VCE result MHS has ever achieved\", through the major academic indicators used in Victoria is presented below:\n\nBeing an academically high-achieving school, Melbourne High School offers a large variety of subjects to choose from relative to other public schools. The range increases as the student moves to higher year levels.\n\nYear 9 students at Melbourne High School study a combination of \"core subjects\" that are compulsory to all and \"electives\" that are only taken by a students who choose those subjects. The core subjects that are taken for the entire year are English, Mathematics, Science, Physical Education, History, Geography and LOTE (or \"Languages Other Than English\", specifically German, French, Indonesian, and Japanese). Similarly, Art (referring to visual arts) is taken for one semester and is replaced by Music for the second semester. Year 9s select one elective per semester. The electives generally cover educational areas that are not covered by the core, such as commerce or software design. Mid-year and end-of-year examinations are used to evaluate performance in each semester and determine a student's progression.\n\nThe Year 10 core subjects operate identically to the year 9 system. However, more electives are available, and several of these electives are more specialised than year 9 electives. Some year 10 electives, such as Business Management, provide an introduction to the VCE Business Management course. Many year 10 students also take the option of selecting a unit of a select few VCE subjects. These students typically advance to take units 3 and 4 of these subjects (the units that are externally examined by VCAA) in year 11. Again, mid-year and end-of-year examinations test material for all subjects.\n\nIn addition, years 9 and 10 students devote one period a week to massed singing, an intrinsic part of the school's tradition and ethos. There is no accelerated program at Melbourne High and all students are taught at the same level. However, students identified by their teachers to have a strong aptitude for mathematics are placed into a Maths Extension program in years 9 and 10. Results in year 9 and 10 examinations also may impact on a student's ability to select a particular Unit 3/4 sequence.\n\nIn Year 11 and 12, students work towards completion of the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). The International Baccalaureate is not offered at Melbourne High School. The general pathway taken by students is to undertake Units 3 and 4 of one subject in year 11, and Units 1 and 2 for five other subjects. In Year 12 students complete Units 3 and 4 for the remaining five subjects that are to count towards their VCE. Typically these are the same subjects that they completed Units 1 and 2 for in Year 11, but this is not an enforced rule, and some students attempt a 3 and 4 sequency without completing the corresponding 1 and 2 sequence. Some students make slight alterations to their VCE selections from this general pathway. University Enhancement subjects from Monash University and the University of Melbourne are an option that is taken by a small number of students each year. Some students also complete an additional Unit 3/4 sequence outside of school, often in Year 11. Unlike many other schools, Melbourne High School does not allow its students to complete two Unit 3/4 sequences inside school in year 11, and does not allow students to complete Mathematical Methods, a very popular subject in the school, in year 11.\n\nThe subjects chosen must include at least one English-related subject as per government regulations. For Melbourne High School students, the normal English subject is compulsory but can be replaced by English as a Second Language (ESL) for particular students. As of 2013, English Language or Literature can replace the normal English subject. Additionally, students are only allowed to select two mathematics subjects (out of the three: Further Mathematics, Mathematical Methods and Specialist Math). As in previous years, only German, French, Japanese and Indonesian are available for study in school, although students often take other LOTEs outside of school. Otherwise, the subjects offered include the entire VCE range as well as some VET courses.\n\nPrior to the announcement of final Year 12 results, the school uses data gained from internal testing throughout the year to determine the recipients of the subject prizes, which exist for every subject.\n\nAt the end of each year students undertake a 'transition' program that introduces them into the next year. These programs are also used to help deliver other skills, including seminars on driving, interview and note-taking amongst other things.\n\nEvery school day comprises seven periods, a recess break, homeroom assembly, and a lunch break. The school operates on a fortnightly timetable. Junior school assemblies are allocated one period a fortnight, whilst senior school assemblies are allocated one period a week. Year 9 and 10 mass singing sessions are allocated one period a week and year 9–12 weekly sport sessions are allocated two consecutive periods a week.\n\nMost formal VCE classes are not held during Wednesdays periods 6 and 7, allowing time for students' personal study and school-assessed coursework examinations to be held.\n\nSchool commences at 8:45 am every day, and all formal classes end at 3:25 pm. As of 2011, a largely student-fought initiative led to year 12 students not being required at school for any free periods they may have at the start or end of the day. As of 2015, years 12 are not required during free periods at the start of the day and may leave instead of attending free periods at the end of the day. As of 2017, year 12 are required to attend homeroom assembly every morning and hence are required during free-periods at the start of the day. However, they may leave the school if they have no more formal class scheduled for the rest of the day.\n\nFollowing a 2016 review of the school's curriculum, a 2-minute transition has been implemented between periods to allow teachers and students to move to their next classes. This has extended the school day from 8:50 - 3:20 to 8:45 - 3:25.\n\nMelbourne High School has one campus, in South Yarra. This campus is split into five building blocks. These are: the Twenties Building (built in 1927, refurbished in 1995), the Nineties Building (built in 1992), the Round Building, the Junior Science Block (built in 1970s) and the Art Building (built in 2008).\n\nThe Twenties Building is a heritage-listed, three-storey rendered brick building in the Collegiate Gothic style. The base level contains the school canteen, the dining hall, two IT rooms and four rooms devoted to mathematics. The ground level serves multiple purposes. The south wing of the ground floor generally functions as geography and mathematics rooms. The north wing of the ground floor is devoted to physics but also contains an extra lecture room. Between the north and south wings is the school's Memorial Hall, the principal's office and the offices of the assistant principals. The first floor of the Twenties building is also split into two wings. The south wing is assigned to history, LOTE and politics. The north wing is assigned to chemistry.\n\nThe Nineties Building, built in the 1990s under principal Ray Willis, includes four floors. The ground floor and first floors are used by the South Yarra Sports Centre, an organisation that provides its facilities both to the outside public and to students of Melbourne High. This ground floor contains a gym, including basketball courts and a swimming pool, and the first floor contains a weights room and cardio room. The second floor contains rooms used for biology, commerce related subjects and music. The third floor is used for English and also contains the school's library.\n\nThe Science Block consists of four science labs split over two levels. These science rooms are generally used only for year 9 and year 10 general science, with other rooms being used for the more specific VCE subjects of chemistry, physics and biology. The Arts Building was completed in the year 2009. It consists of four floors, each containing multiple rooms devoted to the visual and performing arts. These also contain computers and media rooms.\n\nIn addition, the school's grounds include a hockey field, tennis courts, an oval (The Woodfull-Miller oval) for cricket and various codes of football, cricket nets, netball courts and basketball courts for sporting purposes. These are accompanied by the 'hockey pavilion', which overlooks the hockey field, the 'Old Boys Pavilion', which overlooks the oval, and the Cadet HQ, also near the oval.\n\nThe junior school comprises students in year 9 and 10. They have their own four junior school captains, assemblies, and massed singing. Students in the junior school are not subject to the pressures of VCE and are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities and broaden their education. For this reason, year 9 students must involve themselves in at least one extracurricular involvement (see below). Year 10 students complete twenty hours of community involvement throughout the year as well as an assignment on civics and citizenship to be submitted at the end of the year. In year 9, students select two electives for the year while in year 10, students select four electives. Philosophy has been made a compulsory elective in year 9 and economics for year 10\n\nThe senior school comprises students in Year 11 and Year 12. There is only one Senior School Captain and senior School Vice-Captain. Particular members of the senior school will take up presidential roles of various teams, groups and organisations. At the end of every year, year elevens compete for a variety of coveted leadership positions, including positions in the SRC Leadership team and House leadership team. House captains and SRC presidents are determined by voting from the student body following a period of speech-making.\n\nParticipation and academic achievement aggregates in a points system which will culminate in the awarding of the 'MHS Diploma' at the time of the student's graduation. The first graduating class to receive the MHS Diploma was the Class of 2011. The MHS Diploma is the brainchild of Principal Jeremy Ludowyke, who strongly advocates for its continued existence as an integral part of the school's program. The Diploma is completed by passing all subjects and achieving a requisite number of points gained through involvement in co-curricular programs.\n\nInterhouse competitions remain an integral part of the school's ethos. The four Houses with their associated colours are:\n\n\nThe names for the houses were derived from the local history of the area. The hill upon which the school is situated was first settled by captain John Forrest, who built his house, Waterloo cottage, in Como estate alongside the Yarra River. Forrest won the inaugural cockhouse cup in 1928. The house's histories are well documented, with records of victories in major competitions as well as individual school records, being kept. Over the history of the competition all houses have had periods of dominance with five successive victories except Yarra, with the most recent such period being Waterloo in the 2000s (decade). Yarra has been the house with the largest number of victories, owing to a long winning streak through the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). Waterloo has recently been dominating the Cockhouses, winning every year from 2005 to 2009, but overall they are the least successful house. Forrest ended Waterloo's streak, and its own 15-year drought, in 2010.\n\nThe house competition has had its controversial aspects, including the adjudication process in the house choral competition, which was recently improved by adding three adjudicators instead of one. This change was made the year after Waterloo won its first competition in 20 years despite Yarra's standout performance of Nessun dorma. After the adjudication was expanded to three judges Yarra won with their rendition of \"\", although controversy remained after Forrest came last despite receiving heavy applause from the audience for \"Anthem\". In the 2011 competition, controversy arose again when Waterloo came last despite a huge applause from the audience for \"Wavin' Flag\". As of the conclusion of the 2013 house Cross Country, Waterloo was the first house in Melbourne High School history to win all 4 major events in one year and subsequently the Cock House Cup. In the 2019 competition, there was controversy around Waterloo coming second, narrowly behind Como despite their Special Choir's standout performance (and theatrics) of \"It's Raining Men\".\n\nIf a student entering the school has a relative who was (or is) in Melbourne High, then that student is allocated to the same house as their relative's house.\n\nThe houses compete in four major competitions:\nAlways the first event of the year, this event features students from each of the four age groups competing in a number of short and long-distance swimming events at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre's Commonwealth games outdoor swimming pool. Points are accumulated for a house both through relays and individual events. The event runs over one full day, with each individual event containing two students from each house. For the individual events, points are awarded from first place through to fourth, giving houses the opportunity to break ahead if they were to have both competitors in the top four. There are four 50m relays per age group: the A, B, C and D relays. They progressively are less valuable to the house, but are still pivotal in the final calculations for champion. There are also 200 m relays and medleys, which have the same value as an A relay. Extra points are awarded for breaking school records. An age group champion is named from each age group.\n\nThe most recent competition (2020) ended with results: 1st: Forrest, 2nd: Waterloo, 3rd: Yarra, 4th: Como.\n\nBased on points awarded, swimming is the least valuable of the four majors, with first place scoring 80 points, second 64, third 56 and fourth 48. This is justified by the fact that it features the least number of students participating.\n\nThe second major event of the year, the athletics competition has for several years been held over two days at Olympic Park Stadium, however in 2010 it was held on the school oval due to the Melbourne & Olympic Parks precinct redevelopment. The first day largely comprises heats and C, D, E and F relays (as with swimming, the A relay is the most valuable and the F relay the least). The second day contains a large number of finals. Currently, the heats are not worth any points. In the past, the heats were worth very few points, so the second day could make or break a house's chances, as was seen one year in the U15 discus, the final event of the day, where pending results may have affected the outcome of the day. The second day also features A and B relays. Other individual events include the 1500 m walk, the 3000m race and the 2000m steeplechase. These three events are open to all age groups. All other individual events are run within age groups. Both track and field events are competed in. The winner of the Athletics competition is awarded 90 points, second 70, third 60 and fourth 50 points towards the Cockhouse Cup.\n\nThe most recent competition (2019) ended with results: 1st: Como, 2nd: Forrest, 3rd: Waterloo, 4th: Yarra.\n\nThe chorals involves the entire school in one day at the Melbourne Town Hall. It is preceded on that same day by the Instrumentals Competition, which is not a major competition, although it is one of the most important minors. The chorals competition features three pieces sung by each house: a set song, a free choice, and a special choir song. The special choir consists of between 8–20 members of the house while the set song and free choice are sung by the whole house. Rehearsals are held at recess and lunchtimes in the school's memorial hall and are generally coordinated by student leaders in the house.\nThere is also a special choir event that sings in harmonies and more complex songs. In the 2010 competition, Waterloo House rick Roll'd the whole school.\n\nThe most recent competition (2020) ended with results: 1st: Waterloo, 2nd: Yarra, 3rd: Como, 4th: Forrest.\n\nThe cross country competition closes off the house competition and is generally the decider as the Cockhouse Cup reaches its finale. Most of the school runs 5 km around Albert Park Lake in their year levels. All positions are counted from 1st to 250th in each age group. This generally means that the house with the greatest participation wins. Waterloo has won this competition for the last 8 years as of the end of 2010.. Waterloo ended its own cross country winning streak in 2017, losing to Como. \n\nThe most recent competition (2019) ended with results: 1st: Waterloo, 2nd: Forrest, 3rd: Como, 4th: Yarra.\n\nThey also compete in minor competitions:\n\nComo currently holds the Cockhouse Cup (2019) with the most recent overall results: 1st: Como 2nd: Forrest 3rd: Waterloo 4th: Yarra\n\nMelbourne High School offers a music program. The school has a compulsory massed singing program for students in Year 9 and Year 10. Year 9 students also complete a semester of classroom music. The Music Department also offers a number of electives at Year 10 level in Music Craft, Music Technology, Film Music and Music Composition. At VCE level, the department currently offers VCE Music: Group Performance and VCE Music: Solo Performance. This is complemented with an instrumental tuition program on the school's campus.\n\nEach term students choose a sport to play during a double period once a week. There are various sports to choose from, including: rowing, sailing, cricket, football, rugby, tennis, water polo, parkour, golf, squash, cross country running, lacrosse, ten-pin bowling, badminton, lawn bowls, yoga, fencing, soccer, futsal, swimming (for weak swimmers) and Taekwondo. The school also has a burgeoning rowing program, recently establishing a sculling school. Students select new sports after a six-week rotation.\n\nThe school has an active participation in 23 different interschool sports through the Victorian Secondary Schools' Sports Association (VSSSA) and other tournaments. The school is engaged in a further 14 weekend sporting competitions, notably in the areas of water polo, which is supported by the school's indoor swimming pool, and rugby. Hockey, lacrosse and water polo teams are entered into the Australian All Schools' Competition, in which students travel interstate to compete against teams from around the country. Other competitions specific to particular sports also exist.\n\nThe school's performance in sports has been in constant flux. In the past its strengths lay in Australian Rules Football, Melbourne High won all senior VSSSA Australian football titles between 1988 and 1996, and tennis, where Melbourne High five titles in the space of seven years between 1989 and 1995, but as the student demographic changed, so much so that currently more than 90% of students are from East Asian or South Asian background, this strength in football was replaced by greater performance in table tennis and badminton. As of the end of 2009, Melbourne High had won the senior VSSSA badminton competition three times in the last four years, had won the senior table tennis competition nine times in the last ten years and had won the intermediate table tennis competitions for the last five years. The school is also emerging in its Cross Country performance, and has won five out of the six possible VSSSA age group titles it could contend for in the last three years.\n\nThe school also has a tradition of hockey performance, and the MHSOBA uses the school's synthetic turf hockey field for its own senior and junior clubs. The school's own team has won the VSSSA crown seven times in the last nine years. A similar tradition involving the MHSOBA exists with the school's cricket teams, which have been consistently competitive, winning six VSSSA titles over the twenty-year history of the competition.\n\nThe 1st XI cricket team has in the past played matches against the Victorian Governors XI which included Merv Hughes. The school's rich cricketing history led to a 2009 visit from avid cricket fan and media personality Sir Michael Parkinson.\n\nMelbourne High School has a number of leadership opportunities integrated into its leadership program. The opportunities begin as early as year 9, as every form must elect one student as its Form Captain, who serves administerial duties, and another to be its SRC representative, who represents the form in Student Representative Council meetings. In addition, two students from the year level are elected to be the year level's SRC Executives. The pre-election period for this role generally involves active campaigning by students.\n\nIn addition to these roles, there are other more senior leadership opportunities in the school. The school has four Junior School Captains (all in year 10), a School Captain and a School Vice Captain. Several year twelves also comprise the SRC Cabinet, which includes the roles of the President, Vice-President, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer. The SRC serves to advocate and promote student voice and wellbeing, and in addition, organises student initiated events such as socials, formals and inter-form competitions in games such as dodgeball or soccer.\n\nMany involvements, including such as the Global Issues Education group, Political Interest Group, Food Interest Group and Model United Nations Student Association(MUNSA) (see below) have presidents or captains. Most sporting teams also have captains. Within the Cadet Units, there are a series of leadership positions offered to students who completed particular promotion courses over the holidays. There are also leaders in the form of the Year 11 Mentoring Program and the Millgrove Outdoor Education Center leaders.\n\nStudent leaders are often distinguishable from the rest of the students. Most leaders (apart from form captains and SRC representatives, who wear coloured badges) are distinguished through writing sewed onto their blazer pocket. The School Captain and SRC President is further distinguished through the sewing of a golden wreath around the Unicorn of their blazer pocket, whilst the School Vice-Captain and SRC Vice-President have a green wreath around the Unicorn of their blazer pocket. The house captains have a small coloured trim representing their house sewn onto the pocket, Other leadership positions can also be distinguished through badges specific to those positions (Though some badges are simply given to participants of certain student-initiated involvement groups).\n\nThe annual \"Ray Willis Leadership Scheme\" invites all of the students involved in the school's leadership program to a forum discussing a major issue, such as climate change, the Australian identity or multiculturalism. The students then form groups and conduct research on that issue for the remainder of the year, at the end of which they submit a report on their findings. Each group must contain at least one student from each year level and the report must be completed solely in the students' own time.\n\nThe school has an extensive program of student-run clubs, societies and special interest groups. It is compulsory for new Year 9 students to be involved in some of these groups. The school has 54 recognised involvements, groups and societies Some of the major involvements that have been integral in Melbourne High's history are Army Cadets, Air Force Cadets, Chorale, Debating, Instrumental Ensemble and Rowing. Other clubs and societies that exist include educationally themed ones such as the renowned Political Interest Group (PIG), Astronomy club, IT Programming club, Model United Nations Student Association(MUNSA), Global Issues Education (GIE) and Heritage Society as well as recreational ones such as the Bush-walking club, \"The Sentinel\" (student magazine) and FIG (Food Interest Group), otherwise known as the \"Fun With Food\" group. Students pursuing similar interests may gather together and form a new group of their own, subject to the approval of the school's administration. The administration's flexibility in this regard has seen the recent emergence of the TCG Club, Go Club, Jewish Student Network, Students Alive (Christian Religious Group), Baka Anime.\n\nFormer MHS principal once quoted,\"There is a joke here that if you reside in Canberra's halls of power but you haven't been invited to Melbourne High by the PIG, you haven't really made it.\" The Political Interest Group has had speakers ranging from former Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, to former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister Julia Gillard (at the time, Shadow Health Minister), former Federal Minister Stephen Conroy and annually has Andrew Bolt speak at the school. Recently PIG has had journalists such as Catherine Deveny, Derryn Hinch, Barrie Cassidy as well as politicians such as Richard di Natale.\n\nThe chess club, and competition writing group are involvements that participate in interschool competitions, as do the chorale, instrumental ensemble and debating teams. Melbourne High School has been successful in each, with achievements in debating including state championships, Swannie awards and students making the national debating team. In 2008, the school also began involvement with the UN Youth Australia's Thant-Evatt Trophy – a model United Nations Security Council competition – two teams reached the state finals in that year. More recently, the establishment of MUNSA has involved more students in Model UN related activities. This includes the EVATT Competition as well as the interschool Model UN Conference held annually by MUNSA. The school has won the State Final in chess for four years running as of 2009.\n\nIn Year 9, students are introduced to the compulsory involvement program. In year 10, students complete community involvement, which includes a day raising funds in the city for the Red Cross. In Year 11, students undertake cultural involvement, in which they experience different cultures around Melbourne.\n\nThere are School Colours for both Service and Sport. Both are in the form of ties, with a design consisting of the standard MHS tie's stripes and a unicorn at the bottom for Half Colours; and the tie stripe alternating with unicorns for Full Colours. The Unicorns on Sport Colours ties are coloured gold; the ones on Service Colours are silver.\n\nIn addition to the tie, Full Colours recipients as well as holders of some leadership positions can have their blazer emblazoned with their award or position. Position titles are emblazoned above the school emblem on the blazer pocket whilst award titles are emblazoned below. A system of badges is also employed at Melbourne High School (for house captains, SRC executives, class SRC representatives, high academic achievers, form captains and for various clubs).\n\nThe Melbourne High School Speech Night features the awarding of various prizes to particular students for performance in academic subjects, co-curricular achievements or sporting feats. The academic prizes are determined by using data delivered through internal testing of VCE students. There is one academic prize for every subject, as well as a prize for Pure Science and scientific enquiry. The sporting prizes are chosen by the heads of a particular sport to reward the individual deemed to have made the greatest contribution to that sport during their time at Melbourne High. The co-curricular prizes are similarly chosen. In addition, there are prizes for 'Best All-rounder' and 'Sports Champion'.\n\nMelbourne High maintains close ties with its counterpart the Mac.Robertson Girls' High School. Each year the schools join together for the Winter Concert performed at the Melbourne Town Hall, as well as a musical and a drama production performed in the school's memorial hall. Recently a fairly light-hearted Melbourne High vs MacRob Cup has begun to take place and includes events such as debating, netball, soccer and theatre sports.\n\nSister school relationships have been established internationally with high schools in Japan (Kasukabe High School), Germany (Albert-Schweitzer-Gymnasium Gundelfingen), Indonesia (SMAN 4 Denpasar) and France (Lycée Branly Amiens, Pertuis). Annual exchanges occur with each of the sister schools, giving students the opportunity to experience both the culture and education system of another country. Each year Melbourne High either sends a group of students overseas to these schools, or hosts students from these schools. There are also opportunities for individual students to go on a longer term exchange overseas.\n\nMelbourne High has annual sporting contests against North Sydney Boys High School and Adelaide High School during which boys from the visiting school are billeted with host families. Annual exchanges with Sydney Boys High School are also held for basketball, rowing and volleyball.\n\nThe annual competition between North Sydney and Melbourne began in 1959, when a North Sydney Cricket team visited Melbourne for a one-day match in October. In subsequent years the game was increased to two days and the date changed to March so that final year boys could more easily take part. the competition was first expanded in 1969 when, at the team of the Melbourne Headmaster, North Sydney sent a Water Polo and Swimming team to Melbourne in company with the cricketers. During the visit, it was agreed that the Water Polo fixture should become a permanent part of the exchange. In 1971, Squash and Tennis were included in the program and Athletics was added in 1972. Chess was included for the first time in 1975 and in 1976 Golf and Debating teams also competed. Basketball was introduced in 1979. Lawn Bowls and Table Tennis were added in 1990 and Sailing and Fencing in 1992. Rowing was contested in 1993 and Netball was introduced in 1998. Futsal replaced netball in 2004. The Crawford Shield (inaugurated in 1972) is awarded to the overall winner from these events. In the most recent exchange (2019), 13 sports were contested. Melbourne won Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Chess, Cricket, Debating, Fencing, Table Tennis and Water Polo. Sydney won Futsal, Lawn Bowls, Music, and Tennis. Melbourne won the overall exchange and hence the Crawford Shield 9 to 4.\n\nOn 10 March, 2020, less than two weeks before the commencement of Crawford Shield activities, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the first time the event was cancelled since its commencement in 1959. \n\nMelbourne High competes against Adelaide High annually, typically in August. Football, hockey, rowing, badminton, basketball, cross country, debating, soccer, table tennis, tennis, theatre sports and volleyball are contested for the Prefects' Cup. The Prefects' Cup has been held since 1910. As Adelaide High School is coeducational, the MacRobertson Girls' High School also competes, although their performance against the girls of Adelaide High has no bearing on the Prefects' Cup. The Prefects Cup is currently in Melbourne having won the most recent exchange (2016): 7.5 to 3.5\n\nThe school motto is \"Honour the work\". The School motto was derived spontaneously from an eloquent address given to the assembled school by the late Frank Tate ISO, MA, a former Director of Education. In the course of his speech, he quoted the words of Edward Thrik. The song is sung at the start of all school assemblies and other school gatherings such as speech nights. On normal occasions only the first two verses are sung, however on special occasions, such as ANZAC Day, the third verse is also sung.\n\nThe school's official mission statement is:\nThe school's official philosophy statement is:\nStudents are required to wear school uniform, which consists of a black college blazer, green pullover or vest (maroon for VCE students), school tie, white business shirt, grey college trousers and/or grey college shorts, grey or black socks, black polished shoes, and the MHS maroon backpack. The blazer is woollen and is black in colour. It features a maroon and green trim which extends to the collar-region. The school logo (the unicorn) is emblazoned on the left-chest-pocket, which is also where the student leadership positions are stitched. The school blazer must be worn when travelling to and from school. In school grounds, the jumper may be worn as the outer garment. The tie features maroon and green stripes, however, students can also receive half colours and full colours, which are differently coloured ties awarded for various school achievements. Some students also received the black centenary tie in 2005, featuring both the crests of Melbourne High School and the MacRobertson Girls' High School. Recently, changes in uniform regulations allow a special short-sleeved shirt with the school logo monogrammed on the breast pocket to be worn without the tie.\n\nStudents also have access to various sports uniforms which cater for the many different sports and events students undertake. However, there is a particular set of sports uniform which is required by all students. In years 9 and 10, this sports uniform must be worn to compulsory Physical Education, and in all years, the sports uniform must be worn to most weekly sport sessions, depending upon the sport which the students choose to participate in. The compulsory sports uniform consists of a white shirt, with the unicorn featured, or a house singlet, in the colour of the students house, bottle green sports shorts, MHS sports socks (white in colour), and the appropriate runners. Extras include the white school cap, maroon school spray jacket and maroon school rugby top, which was replaced in 2011 by a cream and maroon varsity jacket for year 12 students only. Other sports and involvement items are bought separately, such as cricket whites or other guernseys.\n\nThe following individuals have served as Principal, or any precedent title, of Melbourne High School:\n\nThose who have left the school are known as 'Old Boys' and many join the Melbourne High School Old Boys Association. The Old Boys Association was founded in 1907, and has been in continuous operation since then. The Association provides considerable support to leaving students in their tertiary studies in the form of scholarships. The Association organises sport participation after Year 12, and the MHSOB cricket and football clubs have been historic entities. The MHSOB also has hockey and waterpolo clubs. These institutions have played their part in the production of notable Australian sportspeople, including cricketers Keith Miller and Bill Woodfull as well as a number of champion AFL footballers that includes, \"at least\", three members of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, three Brownlow medalists, seven team-of-the-century members, eight captains, fourteen All-Australian selectees, and twenty-one best and fairest award recipients such as David Parkin, Garry Lyon and Cameron Bruce. The old Central School admission system provided some who rose, but two clubs were within two kilometres walk, and another club about four kilometres, and appropriate arrangements were made for their best education. The Old Boys' organize reunions which occur every 5 years, maintaining contact between Melbourne High alumni.\n\nAs a school that prides itself on academic success, Melbourne High School has produced individuals who have played a major role in research, government, economics and finance including Nobel laureate for medicine Sir John Eccles, who was awarded his prize for his research on the synapse. Melbourne High School students have also contributed to arts and culture. The school has produced a number of best-selling authors including Graeme Base the author of the Animalia series, Raimond Gaita a renowned author/philosopher, Alex Telman, Australia's leading spiritual healer, and Brett King, a respected author and innovator in the banking industry. The male members of the Australian band The Seekers – Athol Guy, Keith Potger and Bruce Woodley – the creators of the now folk song I Am Australian, also attended Melbourne High School, as did two finalists in the popular reality television show Australian Idol in Thanh Bui and Dean Geyer. Geyer currently plays Brodie Roberts in the hit TV Show Glee. A large number of famous Old Boys are featured around the school's corridors in the Distinguished Old Boys gallery.\nMelbourne High School has become an iconic landmark in the city of Melbourne. It featured on \"Thank God You're Here\" on Wednesday, 27 May 2009, where the name of the school was replaced with Kevington Grammar but footage was taken of the school building and school students.\n\nSteven Spielberg's World War Two miniseries \"The Pacific\", the follow-up to \"Band of Brothers\", featured some footage of Melbourne High School, shot in December 2007.\n\nOn 13 August 2010, the Year 12 students had their formal crashed by singer Katy Perry and DJ Ruby Rose.\n\nLili Wilkinson's YA novel \"Pink\" is set in \"The Billy Hughes School for Academic Excellence\", a thinly veiled amalgamation of Melbourne High School and Mac.Robertson Girls High School based on the author's own experience of school theatre at the schools.\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered a form of area studies, taking an overtly interdisciplinary approach to the study of a region. In this sense Middle Eastern studies is a far broader and less traditional field than classical Islamic studies.\n\nThe subject was historically regarded as part of Oriental studies, which also included East Asian studies and Egyptology and other specialisms in the ancient civilizations of the region; the growth of the field of study in the West is treated at that article. Many academic faculties still cover both areas. Although some academic programs combine Middle Eastern studies with Islamic studies, based on the preponderance of Muslims in the region (with Israel and Lebanon being the only exceptions), others maintain these areas of study as separate disciplines.\n\nIn 1978 Edward Said, a Palestinian American professor of comparative literature at Columbia University, published his book \"Orientalism\", in which he accused earlier scholars of a \"subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture\", claiming the bias amounted to a justification for imperialism. Western academics such as Irwin challenged Said's conclusions, however the book became a standard text of literary theory and cultural studies.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, U.S. Middle Eastern studies programs were criticized as inattentive to issues of Islamic terrorism. Israeli-American historian Martin Kramer published a 2001 book, \"Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America\", and \"Wall Street Journal\" article claiming that Middle Eastern studies courses were \"part of the problem, not its remedy.\" In a \"Foreign Affairs\" review of the book, F. Gregory Gause said his analysis was, in part, \"serious and substantive\" but \"far too often his valid points are overshadowed by academic score-settling and major inconsistencies.\"\n\nIn 2002, American writer Daniel Pipes established an organisation called Campus Watch to combat what he perceived to be serious problems within the discipline, including \"analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students\". He encouraged students to advise the organization of problems at their campuses. In turn critics within the discipline such as John Esposito accused him of \"McCarthyism\". Professors denounced by Pipes as \"left-wing extremists\" were often harassed with hate speech. Pipes was appointed to the United States Institute of Peace board of directors by George W. Bush, despite protests from the Arab American community.\n\nIn 2010, foreign policy analyst Mitchell Bard claimed in his 2010 book \"\" that elements of the Arab lobby particularly Saudi Arabia and pro-Palestinian advocates were hijacking the academic field of Middle Eastern studies within several prominent American universities including Georgetown University, Harvard University, and Columbia University. This has involved Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States funding centers and chairs at universities to promote a pro-Arabist agenda. Bard has also accused several prominent Middle Eastern studies academics including John Esposito and Rashid Khalidi of abusing positions by advancing a pro-Palestinian political agenda.\n\nIn addition, Bard has criticized the Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA) for adopting a pro-Palestinian standpoint. Bard has also alleged that MESA marginalizes non-Israel-related topics including the Kurdish–Turkish conflict and the persecution of religious minorities like Christians and ethnic minorities that are non-Arabs such as Jews and Kurds. Finally, Bard has contended that since the September 11 attacks, the Arab lobby working through Middle Eastern Studies university departments have sought to influence pre-university education by tailoring education programs and resources to reflect a pro-Arabist agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is commonly used to solve ordinary differential equations, but is also used within multivariable calculus when multiplying through by an integrating factor allows an inexact differential to be made into an exact differential (which can then be integrated to give a scalar field). This is especially useful in thermodynamics where temperature becomes the integrating factor that makes entropy an exact differential.\n\nAn integrating factor is any expression that a differential equation is multiplied by to facilitate integration. For example, the nonlinear second order equation\n\nadmits formula_2 as an integrating factor:\n\nTo integrate, note that both sides of the equation may be expressed as derivatives by going backwards with the chain rule:\n\nTherefore,\n\nwhere formula_6 is a constant.\n\nThis form may be more useful, depending on application. Performing a separation of variables will give\n\nThis is an implicit solution which involves a nonelementary integral. This same method is used to solve the period of a simple pendulum.\n\nIntegrating factors are useful for solving ordinary differential equations that can be expressed in the form\n\nThe basic idea is to find some function, say formula_9, called the \"integrating factor\", which we can multiply through our differential equation in order to bring the left-hand side under a common derivative. For the canonical first-order linear differential equation shown above, the integrating factor is formula_10.\n\nNote that it is not necessary to include the arbitrary constant in the integral, or absolute values in case the integral of formula_11 involves a logarithm. Firstly, we only need one integrating factor to solve the equation, not all possible ones; secondly, such constants and absolute values will cancel out even if included. For absolute values, this can be seen by writing formula_12, where formula_13 refers to the sign function, which will be constant on an interval if formula_14 is continuous. As formula_15 is undefined when formula_16, and a logarithm in the antiderivative only appears when the original function involved a logarithm or a reciprocal (neither of which are defined for 0), such an interval will be the interval of validity of our solution.\n\nTo derive this, let formula_9 be the integrating factor of a first order linear differential equation such that multiplication by formula_9 transforms a partial derivative into a total derivative, then:\n\nformula_19\n\nGoing from step 2 to step 3 requires that formula_20, which is a separable differential equation, whose solution yields formula_9 in terms of formula_11:\n\nformula_23\n\nTo verify, multiplying by formula_9 gives\n\nBy applying the product rule in reverse, we see that the left-hand side can be expressed as a single derivative in formula_26\n\nWe use this fact to simplify our expression to\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to formula_29\n\nwhere formula_31 is a constant.\n\nMoving the exponential to the right-hand side the general solution to Ordinary Differential Equation is:\n\nIn the case of a homogeneous differential equation, formula_33 and general solution to Ordinary Differential Equation is:\n\nfor example, consider the differential equation\n\nWe can see that in this case formula_36\n\nMultiplying both sides by formula_9 we obtain\n\nThe above equation can be rewritten as\n\nBy integrating both sides with respect to x we obtain\n\nor\n\nThe same result may be achieved using the following approach\n\nReversing the quotient rule gives\n\nor\n\nor\n\nwhere formula_31 is a constant.\n\nThe method of integrating factors for first order equations can be naturally extended to second order equations as well. The main goal in solving first order equations was to find an integrating factor formula_9 such that multiplying formula_54 by it would yield formula_55, after which subsequent integration and division by formula_9 would yield formula_57. To extend this to second order equations, \n\nformula_58\n\nThis implies that a second order equation must be exactly in the form formula_59 for integrating factors to be usable. \n\nFor example, the differential equationformula_60can be solved exactly with integrating factors. The appropriate formula_61can be deduced by examining the formula_62 term. In this case, formula_63, so formula_64. After examining the formula_57 term, we see that we do in fact have formula_66, so we will multiply all terms by the integrating factor formula_67. This gives usformula_68which can be rearranged to giveformula_69Integrating twice yieldsformula_70Dividing by the integrating factor givesformula_71Example 2\n\nA slightly less obvious application of second order integrating factors involves the following differential equationformula_72At first glance, this is clearly not in the form needed for second order integrating factors. We have a formula_73 term in front of formula_74 but no formula_75 in front of formula_76. However,formula_77and from the Pythagorean identity relating cotangent and cosecant,formula_78so we actually do have the required term in front of formula_76 and can use integrating factors.formula_80Multiplying each term by formula_81 givesformula_82which rearranged isformula_83Integrating twice givesformula_84Finally, dividing by the integrating factor givesformula_85\n\nIntegrating factors can be extended to any order, though the form of the equation needed to apply them gets more and more specific as order increases, making them less useful for orders 3 and above. The general idea is to differentiate the function formula_86 formula_87 times for an formula_88th order differential equation and combine like terms. This will yield an equation in the form \n\nformula_89\n\nIf an formula_88th order equation matches the form formula_91 that is gotten after differentiating formula_87 times, one can multuply all terms by the integrating factor and integrate formula_93 formula_88 times, dividing by the integrating factor on both sides to achieve the final result.\n\nA third order usage of integrating factors gives\n\nformula_95\n\nthus requiring our equation to be in the form\n\nformula_96\n\nFor example in the differential equation \n\nformula_97we have formula_98, so our integrating factor is formula_99. Rearranging gives \n\nformula_100\n\nIntegrating thrice and dividing by the integrating factor yields \n\nformula_101\n\n"}

This compound is produced on the largest scale of any molybdenum compound. It is an intermediate in the production of molybdenum metal. It is also an important industrial catalyst. Molybdenum trioxide occurs as the rare mineral molybdite.\n\nIn the gas phase, three oxygen atoms are double bonded to the central molybdenum atom. In the solid state, anhydrous MoO is composed of layers of distorted MoO octahedra in an orthorhombic crystal. The octahedra share edges and form chains which are cross-linked by oxygen atoms to form layers. The octahedra have one short molybdenum-oxygen bond to a non-bridging oxygen. Also known is a metastable (β) form of MoO with a WO-like structure.\nMoO is produced industrially by roasting molybdenum disulfide, the chief ore of molybdenum:\n\nThe laboratory synthesis of the dihydrate entails acidification of aqueous solutions of sodium molybdate with perchloric acid:\n\nThe dihydrate loses water readily to give the monohydrate. Both are bright yellow in color.\n\nMolybdenum trioxide dissolves slightly in water to give \"molybdic acid\". In base, it dissolves to afford the molybdate anion.\n\nMolybdenum trioxide is used to manufacture molybdenum metal, which serves as an additive to steel and corrosion-resistant alloys. The relevant conversion entails treatment of MoO with hydrogen at elevated temperatures:\nIt is also a component of the co-catalyst used in the industrial production of acrylonitrile by the oxidation of propene and ammonia.\n\nBecause of its layered structure and the ease of the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) coupling, MoO is of interest in electrochemical devices and displays. Molybdenum trioxide has also been suggested as a potential anti-microbial agent, e.g., in polymers. In contact with water, it forms H ions that can kill bacteria effectively. \n\n"}

Sommer has written 14 books and over 600 articles, he may be best known for his book \"Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design\" (1969), which discusses the influence of the environment on human activities.\n\n\"[Man] will adapt to hydrocarbons in the air, detergents in the water, crime in the streets, and crowded recreational areas. Good design becomes a meaningless tautology if we consider that man will be reshaped to fit whatever environment he creates. The long-range question is not so much what sort of environment we want, but what sort of man we want.\" ~ Robert Sommer \n\nRobert Sommer was born April 26, 1929, in New York City. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Kansas in 1956 and after teaching in Sweden and the University of Alberta, he arrived at the University of California, Davis in 1963. At Davis, he chaired four departments: Psychology (1964–70); Environmental Design (1991-1994), Rhetoric & Communication (1994–95), and Art (1997-2000) and is now a Distinguished Professor of Psychology Emeritus (since 2003). Though he may be best known for his book \"Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design\", first published in 1969, he has written 14 other books and more than 600 publications on a variety of subjects. His writings on environmental psychology include research in mental hospitals, libraries, classrooms, and living spaces. Sommer also has written a number of articles and a book on mushrooms,and other nontechnical subjects and his work has appeared in the journal \"Worm Runner's Digest\", which publishes scientific papers alongside satirical articles.\n\nSommer's consulting work includes the design of bicycle paths, residence halls, geriatric housing, airports, offices, prisons, farmers' markets, and other facilities. He has also received a number of awards including: City-University Research Award, City of Davis; Research Award, California Alliance for the Mentally Ill; Career Research Award, Environmental Design Research Association; Kurt Lewin Award, Division 9 APA; Fulbright Award to Estonia, USSR; President-Elect 1998–1999, President 1999–2000, APA Div. 34, Doctorem Honoris Causa, Tallinn Pedagogical University.\n\nSommer was influenced by his studies on environmental psychology with Dr. Humphry Osmond, a psychiatrist who researched hallucinogens. Osmond coined the term psychedelic and also worked in mental hospitals researching social environments and how they affect recovery.\n\nSome scholars see Environmental Psychology as strictly a sub-discipline of Psychology or Social Psychology; others see it as an entirely interdisciplinary study. Sommer views Environmental Psychology as both a sub-discipline within the behavioral sciences as well as an interdisciplinary study that involves a variety of disciplines and professions. His view of the discipline is reflected in his writing style; he communicates his ideas without technical, psychological jargon. Though his book, \"Personal Space\", was not specifically written for people outside the field of Environmental Psychology, it is highly readable and thus, accessible to those designers or architects who may actually have the ability to influence building design.\n\nOn Personal Space\n\nSommer makes the distinction between personal space and territory: \"The concepts of 'personal space' can be distinguished from that of 'territory' in several ways. The most important difference is that personal space is carried around while territory is relatively stationary. The animal or man will usually mark the boundaries of his territory so that they are visible to others, but the boundaries of personal space are invisible. Personal space has the body as its center, while territory does not. Often the center of territory is the home of the animal or man. Animals will usually fight to maintain dominion over their territory but will withdraw if others intrude into their personal space.\"\n\nIn his best known book \"Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design\", first published in 1969, Sommer argues that buildings should be built first for function (their usefulness to the user), not form (how they look). The book is divided into two sections: the first section is theoretical, and the second section concerns methods and their applications. In addition to this book, Sommer has written many articles on personal space as well.\n\nOn Learning And The Classroom\n\nAnother theme in Sommer's research is the structure of the classroom and how it affects learning. As a high school student, Sommer himself experienced the difficulty of learning in a classroom where he was unable to see the blackboard due to the poor design of the room. He writes that he struggled in the class until, later in the semester, it moved to a new room where he got a front row seat. There, he could see the blackboard and his \"grades improved markedly\". Sommer devotes a chapter to the effect of classroom structure on learning in his book \"Personal Space\", and has also written many journal articles on the topic as well.\n\nThough the 1960s and 70s were a time of innovation in educational curricula, teaching methods, and classrooms, there was not much thought given to the physical environment of the classroom and how it might affect learning. Sommer introduced two important terms in his book \"Tight Spaces: Hard Architecture and How to Humanize It\". First, the \"open classroom\", which he describes as being a \"more informally arranged and less rigidly structured space\", and \"open education\", a loosening of the current social hierarchy in education where teachers are strictly the sources of knowledge and students only learners. Sommer states that though the addition of \"open classrooms\" cannot increase student participation without there also being an environment of \"open education\", no shift in hierarchy is likely without a change in the construction or arrangement of the classroom.\n\n\"The Soft Classroom\" is an article written by Sommer and Olsen describing a study they conducted on the impact of classroom design on learning. It describes the difference in student participation observed in two differently arranged classrooms.\n\nStreet Art\n\nSommer's book \"Street Art\" (1975) discusses \"the urban community mural in the U.S.A.\" The community mural is created by artists in collaboration with the local community so the art reflects the local culture. \"Some of the chapter topics are: The New Mural Movement; definitions of 'street art' forms; the politics of 'street art'; the Emeryville, California, mudflats, a site for group sculpture; a guide for Locating and Photographing Street Art; and a final chapter concerned with less common 'street art' locations and the future of this type of art.\"\n\nIn \"Street Art\" Sommer states \"the important question is whether painters, writers and poets are obliged to go beyond reflection to interpretation and prescription\" and, in comparing street artists to those who display their work in a gallery, even goes so far as to say: \"one can tell very little about the issues affecting public consciousness by examining the work of studio artists...\" and \"she [the new muralist] cannot afford the haughty contempt that the studio painter may feel for purchasers and patrons ...\".\n\nSommer's work has been called \"valuable for drawing attention to the proliferation of a noncommercial, popular art form in the U.S.A.\", however there are also some criticisms of the book. Wayne Enstice, in his review of \"Street Art\" noted \"A serious deficiency of his book is the abrasive way he chooses to treat the question\"...\"Do Social imperatives demand redefinition of the role of artists?\" He complains that \"Readers are asked to measure the accomplishments of community motivated artists against an antagonistic and oversimplified estimation of studio artists...\". Enstice also dislikes Sommer's division between text and art, saying that it is \"inappropriate\".\n\n\n\n"}

The exception is the Mod 9 sets, which only have two tubes and are fixed in position. The Mark 32 can fire torpedoes of the Mark 44, Mark 46, Mark 50 (from the Mod 17 tubes onwards), and Mark 54 designs, and can be modified to use other torpedoes (such as the MU90 Impact aboard Royal Australian Navy frigates, or Royal Navy units using Sting Ray torpedoes). The tubes are designed to be fired remotely, but manual firing controls are fitted as a backup to all but the s Mod 15 sets, as all aspects of the tubes' operation are controlled remotely. The launch is powered by compressed air in a rear flask, which also doubles as each tube's breech, and the torpedoes are fire-and-forget weapons.\n\nThe launcher can be made from fibreglass, or with a fibreglass liner encased in metal.

The palm is believed to have originated in the Philippines, but is widespread in cultivation and is considered naturalized in southern China (Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan), Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, many of the islands in the Pacific Ocean, and also in the West Indies.\n\nCommon names in English include areca palm, areca nut palm, betel palm, Indian nut, Pinang palm. In English this palm is called the betel tree because its fruit, the areca nut, is often chewed along with the betel leaf, a leaf from a vine of the family Piperaceae. \"Areca\" is derived from a local name from the Malabar Coast of India, and \"catechu\" is from another Malay name for this palm, \"caccu\".\n\n\"Areca catechu\" is a medium-sized palm tree, growing straight to tall, with a trunk in diameter. The leaves are long, pinnate, with numerous, crowded leaflets. \n\n\"Areca catechu\" is grown for its commercially important seed crop, the areca nut.\n\nThe cities of Tanjung Pinang, Pangkal Pinang in Indonesia, the Indonesian province of Jambi (jambi or jambe is areca in Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and Old Malay), Penang Island, off the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Fua Mulaku in the Maldives, Guwahati in Assam, and coastal areas of Kerala and Karnataka in India, are some of the places named after a local name for areca nut. Actually, there are numerous city and areal names in Indonesia and Malaysia using the words pinang or jambe. This shows how important areca nut is in the Austronesian civilization, especially in the modern day Indonesia or Malaysia.\n\nThe seed contains alkaloids such as arecaidine and arecoline, which, when chewed, are intoxicating and slightly addictive. Areca palms are grown in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and many other Asian countries for their seeds.\n\nThe seed also contains condensed tannins (procyanidins) called arecatannins which are carcinogenic.\n\nThe areca nut is also popular for chewing throughout some Asian countries, such as China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, and India and the Pacific Islands, notably Papua New Guinea, where it is very popular. Chewing areca nut is quite popular among working classes in Taiwan. The nut itself can be addictive and has direct link to oral cancers. Areca nuts in Taiwan will usually contain artificial additives such as limestone powder. The extract of \"Areca catechu\" may be addictive.\n\nThe areca palm is also used as an interior landscaping species. It is often used in large indoor areas such as malls and hotels. It will not fruit or reach full size if grown in this way. Indoors, it is a slow growing, low water, high light plant that is sensitive to spider mites and occasionally mealybugs.\n\nIn India the dry, fallen leaves are collected and hot-pressed into disposable palm leaf plates and bowls.\n\n"}

Prior to becoming a candidate for the third season of \"The Apprentice\", she was a successful real estate broker from Boynton Beach, Florida. At the time the show was recorded and produced, she was 26 years old.\n\nShe received a bachelor's degree in linguistics from the University of Florida. Prior to her career as a real estate broker, Todd launched a magazine called \"Capture Life Magazine\" featuring southern Florida lifestyle, which won the Florida Magazine Association Award for design.\n\nIn December, 2012, she married conservative radio host Jason Mattera.\n\nAlthough Todd was one of the last candidates to become a project manager, she gave a very solid performance in this field, ending the show with a record of 3-0. She used focus groups to pinpoint what potential customers would respond to, and also gave everyone credit where credit was due. Todd was never sent to the boardroom, and was never traded to the competing team. She remained on Team Magna for the entire duration of the show. And Todd had the longest winning streak in her season, with nine wins on Team Magna, starting in Week 6 until the interviews portion of the show took place.\n\nOn May 19, 2005 Trump hired Todd. Todd's season of \"The Apprentice\" was also the last season to land in the Top 20 Nielsen ratings, ranking at #15, with an average of 13.96 million viewers.\n\nTodd chose to oversee the renovation of an oceanfront mansion at Palm Beach, Florida, rather than oversee the production of the next Miss Universe Pageant. Donald Trump charged Todd with a $25 million fix-up of the 60,000 square-foot property, which was purchased in 2008 for $95 million by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. The sale of the mansion is claimed to be the most expensive real estate transaction on record in the U.S. at the time.\n\nIn September, 2005, Todd was involved with the 'Find Your Dream Job' college events sponsored by Dove and Cosmopolitan Magazine.

The case was mediated and settled in early 2010 and never went to court.\n\nTodd speaks openly about her Christian beliefs. She occasionally speaks at churches and appeared on \"The 700 Club\" with Pat Robertson and discussed the real estate market. According to that show's biography of her, Todd says \"I'm a strong Christian, and I'm getting ready to launch a Christian biblical-based approach to making and saving money, tithing and giving,\" she says. \"I am getting ready to do what I am passionate about. I want to empower people to create a real positive relationship with and perspective on money, and realize it's all God.\" Since then, she has launched a blog site for Kingdom Entrepreneurs, entitled \"Grow Rich God's Way\"\n\nIn September 2010, Fox News analyzed the performance of Kendra Todd and other \"Apprentice\" winners, and wrote that \"When you look at the roster of former 'Apprentice' winners, it appears The Donald is better at choosing future reality show hosts and camera chasers than he is at finding people who can actually run companies\", and that \"Most turned out to be chumps\". Despite their analysis, Fox News continues to feature Kendra Todd as a real estate contributor on both the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, and has done so since 2005.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, Todd was a guest co-host and money expert on several episodes of \"The Montel Williams Show\".\n\nFrom 2006-2009, Todd was the host of \"My House Is Worth What?\" on HGTV.

He is currently the special assistant to the general manager with the Washington Nationals.\n\nSchaefer attended the University of Connecticut, graduating in 1966. He was a member of the UConn College World Series team in 1965, when he was the team captain and the NCAA home run champion. \n\nIn 1965, Schaefer played collegiate summer baseball for the Sagamore Clouters of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), leading Sagamore to the league title under field manager Lou Lamoriello. He returned to manage the CCBL's Bourne Canalmen in 1971 and 1972, and Hyannis Mets in 1978 and 1979, winning league titles in both years with Hyannis. Schaefer was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHe was drafted as a shortstop by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1966, but never reached the major leagues in three seasons with the organization. He progressed as far as Modesto in the High A California League. Schaefer batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nIn 2005, Schaefer received the Distinguished Alumni Award from UConn, primarily for his achievements on that College World Series team.\n\nTwice, Schaefer has served as the interim pilot of the Kansas City Royals. In 1991, he was interim manager during the period between managers John Wathan and Hal McRae. In 2005, he succeeded Tony Peña on May 11 and served through May 30. On May 31, 2005, Buddy Bell took the reins as permanent manager and Schaefer returned to the bench coach position. Schaefer's position with the Royals was terminated at the end of the 2005 season, the worst in Royals history.\n\nHe began his managerial career in the minor leagues, where he won numerous awards. He was twice named Manager of the Year (in 1980 and 1981) at Class A Greensboro, then a part of the New York Yankees organization. He also managed the New York Mets' Class AAA team in Tidewater to an International League championship in 1985.\n\nHe first joined the Royals organization in 1987, managing the Class AA Memphis Chicks. His first major-league job was as the Royals' first base coach from 1988 to 1990, then he was the Royals' bench coach in 1991. He worked as a special assignment scout with the Royals in 1992.\n\nSchaefer then moved on to the Boston Red Sox organization, serving as a special assignment scout and later the director of player development from 1994 to the midseason of 1998. During that time, he hired Bob Geren as a manager in the Boston farm system; a decade later, when Geren was named the 2007 manager of the Oakland Athletics, he brought Schaefer to Oakland as bench coach on his staff.\n\nAlthough Schaefer received positive notices for his work as the Red Sox' player development chief, he clashed with general manager Dan Duquette and was fired during the summer of 1998; several minor league managers and coaches, including Geren, departed the organization with Schaefer, who spent the next three years as a special assistant to the general manager of the Baltimore Orioles before returning to the Royals in 2001 as a bench coach and infielders coach.\n\nAfter his 2005 departure from Kansas City, he spent 2006 as a special assignment scout with the Atlanta Braves. He was bench coach for the Oakland Athletics in 2007, and was named to the same role for the Dodgers and its new manager, Joe Torre, for the 2008 season, a role he held through 2010. After Torre's retirement, Schaefer announced he would not return on the staff of incoming manager Don Mattingly, saying that he thought Mattingly should pick a younger coach who could continue for a number of years.\n\nHis career record as an MLB manager is 6–12 (.333), including his 5–12 mark during his 2005 tenure.\n\n"}

Thus, each match on the card was ostensibly unsanctioned, meaning they were not subject to the normal rules of WCW-sanctioned wrestling matches. In reality, it was a normally-booked WCW show, albeit one with a tendency to feature more gimmick matches than usual. This notion, however, was downplayed during the last few years that it was part of the WCW PPV schedule. Hulk Hogan was featured in the main event of all six versions of the event.

{"id": "1912949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912949", "title": "Resistance: Fall of Man", "text": "Resistance: Fall of Man\n\nResistance: Fall of Man is a 2006 science-fiction first-person shooter video game for the PlayStation 3. It was developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game is set in an alternate history 1951, and follows Sergeant Nathan Hale as he and the human resistance forces attempt to drive a mysterious alien-like invasion out of the United Kingdom. The story continues in its sequel \"Resistance 2\".\n\nThe game was originally developed under the title \"I-8\", as it was the eighth title to be in production by Insomniac Games. It was released as a PlayStation 3 launch title in the United States on November 14, 2006 and in the PAL region on March 23, 2007. \"Resistance\" had positive critical reception, garnering particular praise in view of its status as a launch title and winning several awards, as well as being the first PlayStation 3 game to sell over one million copies.\n\nSony and Insomniac Games with the Church of England for using interior shots of Manchester Cathedral to recreate the building within the game, as well as \"promoting violence\" within the building.\n\nThe game, along with its sequels \"Resistance 2\" and \"Resistance 3\", shut down its online servers on April 8, 2014. Digital versions of the first two games were released after the servers' closure in Europe.\n\nIn the 1900s, an insect-like alien race known as the Chimera arrive in Russia. Using advanced technology, they infect hundreds of innocent civilians and subject them to artificial evolution, creating a diverse army of creatures ranging from simple foot soldiers to spider-like giants. By 1949, all of Europe has fallen to the Chimera. The following year, a vast invasion force tunnels under the English Channel, conquering much of England and leaving only scattered pockets of human resistance.\n\nIn 1951, the United States, despite taking a position of neutrality in the conflict, sends a task force to assist the UK as part of \"Operation Deliverance\". Among the soldiers is Army Ranger Sgt. Nathan Hale. However, soon after landing in York, he and his squad are ambushed by enemy troops, who infect them with the Chimera virus. Hale, the only survivor, discovers that he has an innate resistance to full infection. Instead, he gains increased strength and reflexes, the ability to instantly heal light injuries, and gold-colored irises, a common trait of the Chimera.\n\nSent to a Chimera conversion center in Grimsby, Hale meets British intelligence officer Captain Rachel Parker and helps her escape. In turn, Parker allows him to accompany British forces launching an offensive in Manchester to recover a missing convoy. The convoy's cargo is subsequently transferred to a resistance command center in Cheshire, which soon comes under attack from the Chimera. While attempting to provide assistance, Hale is separated from Parker and ends up fighting off the attack single-handedly. He then investigates the cargo, which turns out to be an Angel, a powerful creature that directs the Chimera's hive mind. The Angel tries to use its telepathy to control Hale, forcing him to kill it.\n\nHale then links up with Lieutenant Stephen Cartwright, a UK Royal Marines Commando. The two of them learn that the Chimera have established a series of metallic towers throughout Britain, connected by a network of tunnels and power conduits. To make the matter even more puzzling, Parker learns that the towers were excavated, not built. After the Chimera destroy the last British command post in Bristol, Hale undertakes a solo mission into the tunnels, following them all the way to a nexus point in London. Recognizing that the towers are altering the Earth's climate, Hale concludes that destroying them is the key to victory.\n\nUnder Parker and Cartwright's leadership, a massive UK-US force enters London and storms the central tower. Despite their best efforts, the Chimera rally themselves and initiate a counterattack, killing countless soldiers and leaving Cartwright mortally wounded. Against all odds, Hale destroys the tower's power core, causing it to ignite in a massive explosion. This triggers a chain reaction, destroying the other towers and leading to a mass extinction of the Chimera in the UK, ending their threat.\n\nAs Hale's body is never found, the US Army lists him as killed in action. Parker is not convinced, though, and believes that he may still be alive. In a post-credits scene, Hale is shown walking through the snow when a squad of unknown soldiers surround him. Hale briefly contemplates committing suicide with his last grenade, but ultimately surrenders himself to their custody.\n\n\"Resistance: Fall of Man\" is a first-person shooter set in an alternate history. Many of its gameplay features stem from this, most notably the weapons. Some weapons are based on real weapons circa the 1950s, while some weapons are futuristically altered in accordance with the game's storyline. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles, such as those found in the \"Ratchet and Clank\" series, with its proprietary development engine and physics system to create unique human and Chimeran weaponry. Each weapon provides a unique play style and strategy. An example of this is found with the Auger (Chimeran). The primary fire for this weapon is simple rapid fire, but the bullets burrow through walls, actually coming out stronger on the other side, opening up a whole new level of strategy. The secondary fire creates a barrier that is resistant to all bullets but its own. In addition to the usual short- and long-range weapons, the game features several different types of grenades, with both historical and futuristic varieties. For example, one grenade, known as the Backlash grenade, is capable of creating a dome-shaped barrier, where the player can enter for cover. The barrier reflects shots from opposing Chimera. Some weapons are not available on the first play-through of the game but can be found at certain locations on replaying the game.\nThe game features melee attacks, and the motion sensing feature of the SIXAXIS controller is used for a number of things including shaking off enemies that grab onto the player, shaking off tags and flames in multiplayer, and quickly bringing up a map or leaderboard in a multiplayer match. The player also has access to turrets and a drivable jeep with a gun turret on certain levels. The game was also on Sony's list of titles to receive an online update to support the vibration feature of the DualShock 3 controller for Japan, North America, and Europe.\nThere are also skill points that can be earned throughout the single player game. These are awarded for certain actions that are hinted at by their titles; however, the specific details are not revealed until the skill point is actually earned. There are generic skill points that can be earned during any single level, and some that are specific to certain levels of the game. Each task is worth a different number of points which are used to unlock additional media for the game. The requirements for the skill points are not told to the player until unlocked making it more difficult to achieve these points\n\nIn addition, multiple Intel documents can be found scattered throughout each level. These give the player an insight into what has happened, is happening, and will happen.\n\n\"Resistance: Fall of Man\" featured a multiplayer mode for up to 40 players online and up to 4 players offline.\n\nMultiplayer games had little to no latency (subject to player's connection and host location), even while playing the 40 player online due to the implementation of dedicated servers across the PlayStation Network.\n\nThe multiplayer version of the game also enabled players to create their own clan, create their own matches (custom games) or join pre-set games (Ranked Games). While in games, players could talk to their team mates by using a Bluetooth or USB headset. Text chat was also enabled in pre-game lobbies.\n\nThe online multiplayer had an integrated friends system which allowed players to add one another without becoming friends on the PSN. The online friends list showed a player's friend to be either In Lobby, staging or in-game. From here players could Invite to Game, Invite to Party or Send a Message. This in game system allowed for user-friendly interaction between friends and bypassed the need for players to exit the game to talk to friends; a feature that was absent from most other PS3 titles, until system firmware 2.40 was released.\n\nThe online servers for the game (and the sequels) were closed on March 28, 2014 and the online multiplayer is now unavailable. The closure also disabled the game updates, as it used a different updating system, through the multiplayer servers.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, a spokesperson from SCEA posted a message on MyResistance.net, informing players that complications had arisen and that the Worldwide Update and map pack had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. However, the spokesperson did mention that it was only for a short period of time.\n\nIn addition to the above maps, Insomniac made available two additional maps on June 29, 2007 in one map pack for $7.99 USD, $8.99 CAD, £2.99 GBP, €4.49 and $7.45 AU.\n\nAn additional map pack was released on November 29, 2007 that includes two additional maps for the price of $4.99 USD.\n\nAs of December 11, 2008, all map packs for \"Resistance: FoM\" were made available for free as a holiday gift from Insomniac due to the release of \"Resistance 2\".\n\nAll map packs are available for local split-screen multiplayer.\n\nThe map packs were removed from PlayStation Store on March 2014, although only in Europe. They're still available on PlayStation Store in USA although they cannot be used because of the aforementioned server closure. Since the game used a different system to download the game updates (by entering the multiplayer modes, unlike most titles which search for updates from the XMB or after starting them), and since the updates were required for DLC compatibility, the map packs became usable only by people who downloaded the updates before the server closure, on March 2014. Shortly after the closure of the game servers, a digital version of the game was released on PlayStation Store, exclusively in Europe. It comes with all game updates and map packs, and full compatibility with savegames from the physical edition.\n\nThere are many different places the player can play during the game, all of which are based on places in England. The maps all vary in size and some of the more popular locations such as \"Nottingham\" and \"Grimsby\" come in four different sizes.\n\nJust a few days after releasing Patch 6, Insomniac Games unveiled two new maps for \"Resistance: Fall of Man\" for the PS3. The two maps, Bracknell and Axbridge, will be suitable to all types of games and can accommodate from 8 to 40 players per round.\n\nBracknell is an all-interior map where players battle it out amidst the backdrop of Chimeran node and Widowmaker breeding grounds, perfect for vertical and close-quarters combat. Axbridge, on the other hand, is a narrow corridor with two human bases on each end. Aside from good sniping spots, the Axbridge map also provides the perfect venue for close-quarters combat.\n\nIn November 2007, an update for the game was made available that enabled rumble functionality for DualShock 3 controllers. However, it is no longer available for download after the online multiplayer servers shut down on April 8, 2014. It is currently available only with the digital version of the game, released in Europe.\n\nRanked matches automatically place players in a match from a chosen category. The matches intend to group players whose ranks are the same or very close together, to make the matches competitive. Ranked matches give the player experience, which will allow the player to move up different ranks. As the player moves up ranks, special rewards are unlocked for their character.\n\nThere are three categories the player can choose from, each with its own modes with one the player will automatically be placed in. The three categories are:\n\nFree-for-all: In this category there is a deathmatch mode, which is a simple free-for all deathmatch. There is also conversion mode, an elimination game type.\n\nTeam Deathmatch, is the second selectable category which directly takes the player to a Team Deathmatch where two teams battle to see who can get to the point objective first (Normal scoring) by killing the members of the opposing team. Map Pack Mayhem was recently added to the Team Deathmatch game mode.\n\nTeam Objective: When selecting this category the player will either be taken to a Meltdown, Capture the Flag, Breach or Assault game type. The most common mode the player is automatically taken to is Meltdown, in which two teams fight to capture nodes.\n\nThe multiplayer for \"Resistance\" also allows highly customizable unranked matches, known as 'Custom' matches allowing the hosts to set different parameters such as hit points, weapon sets and others. Custom matches already in progress can also be joined and the player can join matches of his/her choice with a filter that detects matches meeting the player's chosen criteria. Other Players can also be invited to games using the buddy list. Custom games do not have much XP to gain as opposed to Ranked matches.\n\nThe offline (split screen) multiplayer also features a range of modes, These include: Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Breach, Assault, Meltdown and Skirmish.\n\nIn all of these modes the player can decide the map they play the game on, the time limit, the number of lives, the teams (if applicable), the points limit and plenty of other variables.\n\n\"Resistance\"'s competitive multiplayer does not feature the vehicles found in the game's Campaign mode.\n\n\"Resistance: Fall Of Man\" also features an offline co-operative mode that allows players to play through the campaign mode with a friend.\n\nWhile playing online the player will either be assigned to the Human or Chimera species, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe game was previously known as \"I-8\" when a demo of the game was first shown in E3 2005 as a World War II-inspired, alien-infested first-person shooter. Insomniac Games, who developed the \"Spyro\" and \"Ratchet & Clank\" series' of video games, were going to be developers of the game. A new demo was shown by Sony Computer Entertainment in the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March 2006. The new demo was in real-time, demonstrating the gameplay, graphics and effects like bump mapping. Insomniac was said to \"love the Blu-ray's contribution of tremendous space to gaming\". The team also \"loved the multiple simultaneous processor units\".\n\nOfficially-renamed \"Resistance (Fall of Man)\", it was unveiled as part of Phil Harrison's \"Beyond the Box\" keynote address, and was fully playable on the GDC stage. Insomniac President Ted Price spoke about the benefits of PlayStation 3, the advantages of Blu-ray storage, and the reasons that his team at Insomniac decided to develop for Sony Computer Entertainment in the next generation. It was also officially revealed that \"Resistance\" would be released before the end of 2006, but no information about it being a launch title.\n\n\"Resistance: Fall of Man\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Resistance: Fall of Man\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nWithin the first few hours of the PS3's Japanese launch, the game had already received praise from some publications. \"Famitsu\" gave the game a score of 33 out of 40. IGN was the first Western site to review the game, with reviewer Jeremy Dunham declaring that while other consoles had to wait years to get their killer app, \"PlayStation 3 users get theirs on day one.\"\n\nFollowing closely GameBrink.com posted their review. However, the scores at the time of European launch were less brilliant. \"Eurogamer\"s UK review complained that, while functional, and even occasionally entertaining, the game completely failed to innovate.\n\n411Mania gave it a score of 9.6 out of 10 and said that it initially \"felt like \"Call of Duty\", but as I progressed through the game, I found that there was substantially more. The game plays it by the numbers in many ways but it's very polished and fun. The multiplayer will keep you occupied for months. Any PS3 owner will do themselves a disservice by not picking up this game.\" \"USA Today\" gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying, \"Easily the best game for the new Sony PlayStation 3 game console, Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter that lets you, as an American soldier stationed in the United Kingdom, lead the fight to rid the world of a vicious alien race.\" \"Maxim\" similarly gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying that the game \"managed to exceed our lofty expectations, but only by an wirey crotch hair.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" also gave it four stars out of five and called it \"an accomplished shooter providing many fun online modes, engaging solo missions and superb weapons.\" However, \"The New York Times\" gave it an average review, saying that \"In spite of rave reviews it’s a fairly pedestrian humans-versus-aliens first-person shooter that brings nothing new to the genre. The artificial intelligence of combatants is lackluster, and the semi-sepia-toned graphics are surprisingly unimpressive, no better than what you would see on the five-year-old Xbox.\"\n\nThe combat scenes that take place within a virtual representation of Manchester Cathedral in England caused controversy with the leaders of the Church of England. They claimed its depiction to be desecration and copyright infringement, and that it was inappropriate of Sony to allow players to fire guns in a city with a gun problem. They made several legal threats against Sony.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" is the direct sequel to \"Fall of Man\". It continues the story of Nathan Hale as he defends the United States from the Chimera. Multiplayer in the game now supports up to 60 players online and up to 8 players in co-op mode. The game was released in North America on the November 4, 2008.\n\nA spin off sequel, called \"Resistance: Retribution\", was announced on July 15, 2008 at Sony's E3 2008 press conference. It is a third-person shooter for PlayStation Portable and has been developed by Sony Bend, better known for developing the Syphon Filter series. The story takes place in Europe following the destruction of the Tower of London and features returning characters from \"Fall of Man\" as well as the new protagonist named James Grayson. It was released March 17, 2009 in North America.\n\nOn October 11, 2009, the website \"Joystiq\" reported that a billboard advertising \"Resistance 3\" was spotted in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\n\"Resistance 3\" was officially announced on August 17, 2010 during Sony's Gamescom 2010 press conference along with a live-action trailer. It was released in North America on September 6, 2011.\n\n\"Resistance: Burning Skies\" is the second spin-off in the \"Resistance\" series developed by Nihilistic Software. It was released on the PlayStation Vita in May (NA, AU), June (EU) and July (JP) 2012.\n"}
