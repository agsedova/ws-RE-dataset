It is held at the Leconte Center in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, United States.\n\nThe first National Quartet Convention was held in 1957. J. D. Sumner, Cecil Blackwood and James Blackwood of The Blackwood Brothers were the founders of the famous National Quartet Convention formerly held in Memphis, Tennessee. The National Quartet Convention featured all the major gospel groups at a three-day event at the Ellis Auditorium in Memphis, Tennessee. After the first couple of years, the NQC was moved to Birmingham, Alabama in 1959 and Atlanta, Georgia in 1960. It returned to Memphis in 1961 and was drawing annual crowds of 20,000 by the mid-1960s. Sumner bought the convention in 1971 and moved it to Nashville, Tennessee in 1972, where it remained until 1993. After 1993, it was moved to a new home, Louisville, Kentucky. In 2014 the convention moved to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which is the home of the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame.\n\nOver the years, the National Quartet Convention grew from three days of concerts to a six-day multi-purpose event. A main attraction is the exhibit hall with approximately 500 booths where artists, record labels, CD duplication plants, media entities, booking agents, Christian bookstores, and other industry related organizations display their products and offer their services. The week is largely attended by the older generation but lately due to the popularity of groups such as the Booth Brothers, Signature Sound, Legacy Five, The Collingsworth Family and the Gaither Vocal Band, the fans are becoming younger. Fans meet their favorite artists in the exhibit area.\n\nA concert is held each evening in the Leconte Center at Pigeon Forge, typically approaches sellout numbers for the concerts. These concerts years past ran for approximately six hours but in 2009 they have shortened the evening to five hours, 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. and feature non-stop music from the major Southern Gospel artists spaced at 10-20 minute intervals. \"The Singing News\" used to present the Fan Award on the Thursday night of the week but it was changed to Saturday night in 2009. Afternoons are devoted to showcases, some for new talent and others for conceptual events. For example, a couple of popular showcases have been Mike Speck's \"Choral Music Extravaganza.\" and \"Glorious Piano Extravaganza\" featuring the best in southern gospel music piano players. These are usually the highlights of the afternoons. There is a talent competition during the week as well.\n\nIn addition to the events for the fans, industry members routinely schedule meetings and even recording sessions to coincide with the convention. Groups needing to replace a member make new contacts at NQC and sometimes conduct auditions during the week. Various business deals are made or renegotiated. Hoping to gain exposure, up and coming artists schedule showcases at nearby hotels. Record labels court radio and media by feeding them meals, taking them on riverboat cruises and facilitating access for interviews with the artists.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the convention added three additional events designed to take the Southern Gospel convention experience to regions distant from Louisville. These new events were the Great Western Convention in Fresno, California; the Canadian Quartet Convention in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada; and the Central Canada Gospel Quartet Convention in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Within a few years, though, they had sold or abandoned those events in favor of focusing on the main event in Louisville.\n\n1999: Glen Payne made his final public performance via telephone from his hospital room at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. He performed \"I Won't Have to Cross Jordan Alone\" at the request of George Younce his singing partner from The Cathedral Quartet. Glen died one month later.\n\n2005: Lauren Talley, Jason Crabb, and several other young Southern Gospel vocalists joined together to record an album called \"The Torch\". \"The Race\", a song from the album, was voted #1 on some local charts in late 2005.\n\n2007: Ivan Parker became the first soloist to take the Convention stage in 25 years.\n\n2013: Tracy Stuffle of The Perrys joined his wife Libbi Perry-Stuffle on stage via FaceTime on her iPhone. Tracey had been unable to attend in person following a stroke suffered January 21, 2013. In a pre-recorded video message he stated he planned to attend the 2014 NQC in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\n2013: Brazilian Christian group Quarteto Gileade, based in Rio Verde, Goiás, sang Handel's Hallelujah Chorus in Portuguese, becoming the first non-American group to perform at the main stage of the NQC. Many foreign groups have attended the convention over the years, some also sang in the showcase afternoons, but none had made it to the main stage until then. In the following year, they performed again at the main stage, singing Gold City's \"\"I Get Down\"\" in English with some verses in Portuguese, being joined after by Gold City themselves.\n\n"}

He was well known for his extreme submarine-style pitching, and his success in Major League Baseball (MLB) despite his unconventional delivery and the slow speed at which he threw the ball (his fastball was only in the mid 80-mph range). This led to him figuring prominently in the Michael Lewis book \"Moneyball\", which in 2011 was made into the film of the same title. Bradford is played by actor Casey Bond in the film.\n\nBradford was born in Byram, Mississippi. His father had suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed, so that he could only throw underhand when playing catch with his son. Author Michael Lewis speculates that memories of his father's throwing motion may have contributed to the development of Bradford's pitching style.\n\nBradford went to Byram High School. Unlike most players who become major leaguers, he had not exhibited outstanding athletic talent through the early years of high school. But his high school coach suggested he try sidearm pitching after learning some tips about the approach from a professional player. This technique brought him enough success to get a spot on the teams of Hinds Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox selected Bradford in the 1994 MLB draft, but he elected to stay in college through 1996. The White Sox—the only major league team that had even scouted him—re-drafted him in the 13th round of the 1996 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in at the age of 23. In 29 games, he had an ERA of 3.23 with 11 K's in 30.2 innings.\nIn , Bradford made only 3 appearances in the majors while spending most of the season with the Triple-A Charlotte Knights. He was successful as a September call-up in and pitched in the American League Division Series.\n\nFollowing the season, the White Sox traded him to the Oakland Athletics for catcher Miguel Olivo.\nFrom to , Bradford was a specialty reliever for the Athletics, having success against right-handed hitters. His ERA stayed around 3.00 for his entire career until 2004 when he had a setback. It was said to be because of his mounting back pain which eventually forced him on to the disabled list.\n\nIn July, , the Boston Red Sox acquired Bradford from Oakland in a trade for outfielder Jay Payton. Bradford, on the disabled list since undergoing lower back surgery March 7, was activated after the All-Star break. For Boston, Bradford had a 3.86 ERA with a 1.414 WHIP in 23⅓ innings.\n\nAfter the season, he became a free agent and was signed by the New York Mets where he was reunited with Rick Peterson, his pitching coach from the Athletics. He had a very solid year in as a right-handed specialist out of the bullpen, posting a 2.90 ERA in 70 games.\n\nOn November 28, 2006 Bradford signed a three-year, $10.5 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. On May 31, 2008, Manny Ramirez hit his 500th career home run off of Bradford (that was one of only 3 HRs allowed all season). \n\nOn August 7, 2008, Bradford was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays for a player to be named later. With a lot of postseason experience under his belt, Bradford shined in the 2008 playoffs and played a big part in Tampa Bay's World Series run. Bradford pitched in the 2008 World Series, allowing one hit in two innings for Tampa Bay.\n\nBradford remained with the Rays into 2009; however, he began the season on the disabled list after injuring his elbow in spring training. Bradford returned in June but shortly thereafter returned to the disabled list, this time after injuring his back while warming up. Bradford was sidelined again at the end of the season with various pains. When on the mound, he was of questionable effectiveness, allowing 22 hits in 10 innings. Largely because of recurring injuries, Bradford told the St. Petersburg Times after the season that he was considering retirement. With no media attention and no interest from MLB clubs, Bradford retired and went to work as a coach in Mississippi.\n\nIn 24 career postseason games, Bradford posted an 0.39 ERA, allowing just one run.\n\n"}

It is currently available both as an individual product and as one of the varieties of Hershey's Miniatures.\n\nThe formula was modified in 1995 to add more peanuts. \n\nIn 2008, Hershey replaced cocoa butter with cheaper oil substitutes. Hershey changed the description of the product and altered the packaging slightly along with the ingredients. Though the formula contained chocolate, according to United States Food and Drug Administration food labeling laws, these modified recipes that do not contain cocoa butter cannot be legally described as milk chocolate. \n\nBy 2014, milk chocolate returned as the primary ingredient.\n\n\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\" was a novel by Judith Rossner, published in 1975 and adapted as a film in 1977.

Jesus arrived at the village of Nain during the burial ceremony of the son of a widow, and raised the young man from the dead. ()\n\nThe location is the village of Nain, two miles south of Mount Tabor. This is the first of three miracles of Jesus in the canonical gospels in which he raises the dead, the other two being the raising of Jairus' daughter and of Lazarus.\n\nThe miracle is described thus:\n\nThe raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath, by the Old Testament prophet Elijah (), is seen by Fred Craddock as the model for this miracle, as there are several parallels in the details.\n\nThe raising of the son of the woman of Shunem () by Elisha is also similar, including the reaction of the people. In particular, the location of Nain is very close to Shunem, identified with modern Sulam. Sinclair Ferguson calls attention to this as an example of a repeated pattern in the history of redemption. He concludes that the pattern repetition \n\"comes to its fullness in the person of Jesus Christ, the great prophet who heals not merely through delegated authority from God, but on his own authority, without rituals or prayers, but with a simple word of power. Here is the great God and Saviour of Israel in the flesh\"...\n\nThe woman in the story had lost both her husband and her only son, so that there was no one left to support her. As she could not have inherited the land, the loss of her only son would have left her dependent on the charity of more distant relatives and neighbours.\n\nBoth this account and the preceding one of the healing of the Centurion's servant () serve as a precursor to Jesus' assurance to the imprisoned John the Baptist that He is truly, 'the one who is to come' (), since, 'the dead are raised.'

{"id": "2237220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237220", "title": "ADDIE Model", "text": "ADDIE Model\n\nADDIE is an instructional systems design (ISD) framework that many instructional designers and training developers use to develop courses. The name is an acronym for the five phases it defines for building training and performance support tools:\nMost current ISD models are variations of the ADDIE process. Other models include the Dick and Carey and Kemp ISD models. Rapid prototyping is another common alternative.\n\nInstructional theories are important in instructional materials design. These include behaviorism, constructivism, social learning, and cognitivism.\n\nFlorida State University initially developed the ADDIE framework to explain, “...the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development (ISD) program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity.” The model originally contained several steps under its five original phases (analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate). The idea was to complete each phase before moving to the next. Subsequent practitioners revised the steps, and eventually the model became more dynamic and interactive than the original hierarchical version. By the mid-1980s, the version familiar today appeared.\n\nThe origin of the label itself is obscure, but the underlying ISD concepts come from a model developed for the U.S. armed forces in the mid 1970s. As Branson (1978) recounts, the Center for Educational Technology at Florida State University worked with a branch of the U.S. Army to develop a model, which evolved into the Interservice Procedures for Instructional Systems Development (IPISD), intended for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. Branson provides a graphic overview of the IPISD, which shows five top-level headings: analyze, design, develop, implement, and control. Virtually all subsequent historical reviews of ID reference this model but, notably, users do not refer to it by the ADDIC acronym. The authors and users refer only to IPISD. Hence, it is clearly not the source of the ADDIE acronym.\n\nThe analysis phase clarifies the instructional problems and objectives, and identifies the learning environment and learner's existing knowledge and skills. Questions the analysis phase addresses include:\n\nThe process of asking these questions is often part of a needs analysis. During the needs analysis instructional designers (IDs) will determine constraints and resources in order to fine tune their plan of action. \n\nThe design phase deals with learning objectives, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning, and media selection. The design phase should be systematic and specific. \"Systematic\" means a logical, orderly method that identifies, develops, and evaluates a set of planned strategies for attaining project goals. \"Specific\" means the team must execute each element of the instructional design plan with attention to detail. The design phase may involve writing a \"design document/design proposal\" or \"concept and structure note\" to aid final development.\n\nIn the development phase, instructional designers and developers create and assemble content assets described in the design phase. If e-learning is involved, programmers develop or integrate technologies. Designers create storyboards. Testers debug materials and procedures. The team reviews and revises the project according to feedback. After completing the development of the course material, the designers should conduct an imperative pilot test; this can be carried out by involving key stakeholders and rehearsing the course material. \n\nThe implementation phase develops procedures for training facilitators and learners. Training facilitators cover the course curriculum, learning outcomes, method of delivery, and testing procedures. Preparation for learners includes training them on new tools (software or hardware) and student registration. Implementation includes evaluation of the design.\n\nThe evaluation phase consists of two aspects: formative and summative. Formative evaluation is present in each stage of the ADDIE process, while summative evaluation is conducted on finished instructional programs or products. Donald Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Learning Evaluation are often utilized during this phase of the ADDIE process.\n\nSome institutions have modified the ADDIE model to meet specific needs. For example, the United States Navy created a version they call PADDIE+M. The P phase is the planning phase, which develops project goals, project objectives, budget, and schedules. The M phase is the maintenance phase, which implements life cycle maintenance with continuous improvement methods. This model is gaining acceptance in the United States government as a more complete model of ADDIE. Some organizations have adopted the PADDIE model without the M phase. Pavlis Korres (2010), in her instructional model (ESG Framework), has proposed an expanded version of ADDIE, named ADDIE+M, where Μ=Maintenance of the Learning Community Network after the end of a course. The Maintenance of the Learning Community Network is a modern educational process that supports the continuous educational development of its members with social media and web tools.\n\n"}

Sumner\n\nJohn Daniel Sumner (November 19, 1924 – November 16, 1998) was an American gospel singer, songwriter, and music promoter noted for his bass voice, and his innovation in the Christian and Gospel music fields. Sumner sang in five quartets and was a member of the Blackwood Brothers during their 1950s heyday. Aside from his incredibly low bass voice, Sumner's business acumen helped promote Southern Gospel and move it into the mainstream of American culture and music during the '50s and '60s.\n\nJ. D. Sumner first sang with The Sunny South Quartet from 1945 to 1949. The quartet was headquartered in Tampa, Florida and was sponsored by the Dixie Lily Flour Company. In 1949, Sunny South manager Horace Floyd relocated the quartet to Orlando, but Sumner stayed behind in Tampa where he maintained the sponsorship and started a new group, the Dixie Lily Harmoneers, which he sang with for a few months.\n\nLater in 1949, J. D. Sumner left the Dixie Lily Harmoneers and moved up to Atlanta, Georgia, where he joined the Sunshine Boys. They split their time between Atlanta and Wheeling, West Virginia with the occasional trip to Hollywood to sing in Western movies. The lineup of Fred Daniel on tenor, Ed Wallace on lead, Ace Richman on baritone, and J. D. on bass continued on for five years until June 30, 1954.\n\nOn June 30, 1954, tragedy struck the Blackwood Brothers Quartet when a disastrous test run in their private plane cost the lives of baritone R. W. Blackwood and bass singer Bill Lyles. J. D. Sumner was immediately hired by the Blackwood Brothers to sing with them to replace Lyles. Cecil Blackwood joined at the same time to replace his brother R. W. on baritone. J. D. sang with the Blackwood Brothers Quartet from 1954 until 1965. While he was with the Blackwoods, Sumner brought the idea of traveling cross country in a tour bus rather than flying, and was the first professional musical group to do so in any genre. He also established the National Quartet Convention along with James Blackwood to showcase the various quartets in the industry and the convention became an annual festival and mainstay in the industry that continues to this day. It was also during this time he met Elvis Presley. Presley lived in Memphis, Tennessee as a young boy and would attend the all night sings at The Ellis Auditorium. Presley was an avid fan of Southern Gospel music and groups such as The Blackwood Brothers and The Statesmen Quartet. Sumner recalled that Presley had missed a concert one month, and Sumner inquired why he did not attend. Presley replied he had no money to get into the show, and Sumner said \"Son you come find me when you want to get in, money or not.\" Sumner then told his group mates to let Presley in the back stage door so he could attend. Years later, Presley would try out for The Songfellows Quartet, a group associated with The Blackwood Brothers, though did not receive an invitation to join. Shortly thereafter, Presley recorded a demo at Sun Records in Memphis which launched his legendary rock and roll career.\n\nIn 1962, J. D. Sumner became the manager of the Stamps Quartet, and three years later, he left the Blackwood Brothers to sing with them. Sumner was most noted as the leader of the Stamps Quartet, which became known as J. D. Sumner & The Stamps. As a teenager, Elvis Presley idolized Sumner's singing after seeing him perform with the Sunshine Boys. Presley hired Sumner & The Stamps as his back-up singers in 1971. The group toured and recorded with Presley from November 1971 until Presley's death in 1977. Sumner not only sang at Elvis' funeral but had previously sung at the funeral of Elvis' mother Gladys in 1958. J. D. and The Stamps opened for Jerry Lee Lewis in 1980 in the United Kingdom, the Stamps only overseas performance.\n\nAfter the Stamps Quartet disbanded in 1980, Sumner with Hovie Lister, Jake Hess, Rosie Rozell, and James Blackwood formed the Masters V as a special consolidation of members of the Blackwood Brothers Quartet and Statesmen Quartet. The group was a showcase for Sumner's voice and compositions and won the 1981 Grammy Award for best traditional gospel performance. Sumner was credited not only for his singing, songwriting, and concert promotions, but was also noted for being the first to customize a coach bus for the entertainment business to use for music groups.\n\nAfter the Masters V disbanded in 1988, Sumner reformed the Stamps Quartet and performed with the group until his death in 1998. He was often seen in his latter years appearing as a guest artist on the Bill Gaither Homecoming videos. After Sumner's death, lead singer Ed Enoch, a member of the Stamps since 1969, took over the group and renamed it \"Ed Enoch and the Golden Covenant.\"\n\nSumner met a young Elvis Presley when he was singing with the Blackwood Brothers. Presley was 14 and had shown up to a concert but did not have the money to get in, Sumner found out about it and told Presley anytime he wanted to come in to find him and he would admit him at any place they were singing. The two formed a strong relationship.\n\nIn a 1990 interview with Geraldo Rivera, Sumner debunked many myths regarding Presley's substance abuse, namely that Presley was a heavy drinker and used illicit substances. \"I knew Elvis from the time he was 14, and all I ever saw him drink was one glass of peach brandy. He (Presley) would fire you for using marijuana, he detested cocaine, and barely approved of me drinking.\" Sumner also stated that Elvis \"had no idea that he was killing himself with his medications, he felt as long as he was doing what the Doctor was OK with, he was staying within the bounds.\" Presley's death hit Sumner hard and The Stamps sang at Presley's funeral and Sumner credits Presley with saving his own life by intervening with his own alcohol use. \"He (Elvis) helped saved my marriage, my health, my career, and ultimately, my life.\"\n\nFor 18 years, Sumner held the Guinness World Record for recording the lowest bass note. As of 2011, he has been surpassed only by the following three vocalists: Dan Britton (1984), Tim Storms (2002 and once more in 2012), and Roger Menees (2011). Sumner was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nIn 1964, Sumner founded the Gospel Music Association with James Blackwood. He was also the founding force behind the National Quartet Convention.\n\nSumner wrote more than 700 songs including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Masters V discography\n\n"}

In the lead-up to, and during, the November 2005 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the IFEX-TMG called attention to Tunisia's failure to respect international human rights standards as the summit's host.\n\nIn the years running up to and during the Arab Spring, and the immediate months after, the chairman spokesman and chief fundraiser of the IFEX-TMG was Rohan Jayasekera, then Associate Editor of Index on Censorship. He was succeeded in 2012 by Virginie Jouan of the World Association of Newspapers who remained in post until IFEX wound up the group in late 2012.\n\nA mission carried out in April 2011 post-revolution took place in an entirely different context. In stark contrast to previous missions, the delegation of seven IFEX-TMG member groups was able to meet and talk openly with civil society groups, human rights activists, journalists, bloggers and representatives from across the political spectrum. The work of the IFEX-TMG in consistently raising freedom of expression issues both inside Tunisia and on the international stage during the country's darkest years was widely praised, while opinions on how the transition process is unfolding were freely given. A full report is being issued on 1 June 2011.\n\n\"Tunisia needs a truly independent judiciary to reverse its worsening record on human rights and treatment of prisoners of opinion.\" This is a key conclusion of the latest IFEX-TMG mission to Tunisia in April/May 2010.\n\nIt draws from research and interviews during the IFEX-TMG's seventh mission to Tunisia, conducted between 25 April and 6 May 2010. The IFEX-TMG found that there had been a significant deterioration of human rights in Tunisia since the last IFEX-TMG mission in 2007.\n\nThe report records a number of recurring cases of harassment, surveillance, and imprisonment of journalists and human rights activists some of whom have been detained in harsh conditions, physically harassed and dismissed from their jobs. Others have been denied their rights to communicate and move freely. The report culminates with 18 specific recommendations for change.\n\nA pot-pourri of administrative sanctions used to limit free expression and exert indirect pressure on journalists and human rights defenders are also addressed. These include denying licences to independent and opposition media, the harassment of critical journalists and human rights defenders and the confiscation of publications.\n\nAnother chapter analyses the tactics the Tunisian authorities have employed in an effort to prevent the emergence of an independent judiciary, in spite of its national and international obligations.\n\nFrom 14 to 19 January 2005, six members of the IFEX-TMG conducted a fact-finding mission to Tunisia, where they met with writers, publishers, editors, journalists, human rights defenders and academics, as well as government officials and government-sponsored organisations.\n\nThe resulting report, \"Tunisia: Freedom of Expression Under Siege\", documented extensive censorship in the country, including:\n\nIn September 2005, members of the IFEX-TMG returned to Tunisia to assess whether free expression conditions had improved since the first report. It found systematic censorship of newspapers and books; blocking of Internet sites; systematic surveillance of e-mails and telephones; denial of the right to legal accreditation of independent civil society associations; and threats against freedom of assembly.\n\nFree expression violations in Tunisia continue to run rampant, six months after the government attracted controversy for muzzling civil society activists during the World Summit on the Information Society last November, according to a new report by the IFEX Tunisia Monitoring Group, which undertook a mission in April 2006.\n\nFollowing a mission to Tunisia in February and March 2007, the IFEX-TMG launched its fourth report – Freedom of Expression in Tunisia: The Siege Holds – in Cairo, Washington, Paris and Geneva. The report, available in English, French and Arabic, states: \"a lack of positive change has led us to conclude that the Tunisian government has sought to further stifle dissidents since the previous TMG report of May 2006.\"\n\nThe IFEX Tunisia Monitoring Group believes that Tunisia must abide by its international obligations as a signatory to UN human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as the host of the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 2005.\n\nThe following 18 recommendations are based on the statements made by the wide variety of civil society representatives which the IFEX-TMG mission members met in April/May 2010 and the IFEX-TMG's thorough assessment of the situation in Tunisia.\n\nThe IFEX-TMG strongly urges the Tunisian government to:\n\nThe IFEX-TMG recommends media practitioners, state-owned media outlets, as well as private outlets that are close to the government to:\n\n\n\n"}

The low-lying areas of the park and adjacent neighborhood is a former wetland which surrounded the mouth of Thornton Creek. As with nearby Magnuson Park at Sand Point, most of the wetland disappeared when the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the lake in 1916 by building the Montlake Cut and the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The area south of the main beach was the site of Pan American World Airways' offices and the dock for ’s Boeing \"Clipper Ships\"—the world’s first commercial air transports over ocean. \n\nMatthews Beach Park now boasts a hilly knoll with towering Douglas firs and other trees, picnic tables, a playground, and a swimming beach with lifeguards and a diving platform in summer months. Thornton Creek empties at the southern end of the park, which has been partially rehabilitated to include a wildlife pond, native plants, and bird nesting areas. The Thornton Creek watershed has hosted at least five indigenous species of Pacific salmon and trout, and has been the subject of daylighting efforts at locations further upstream.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The reaction was discovered by and named after Hermann Staudinger. The reaction follows this stoichiometry:\n\nThe Staudinger reduction is conducted in two steps. First phosphine imine-forming reaction is conducted involving treatment of the azide with the phosphine. The intermediate, e.g. triphenylphosphine phenylimide, is then subjected to hydrolysis to produce a phosphine oxide and an amine:\n\nThe overall conversion is a mild method of reducing an azide to an amine. Triphenylphosphine or tributylphosphine are most commonly used, yielding tributylphosphine oxide or triphenylphosphine oxide as a side product in addition to the desired amine. An example of a Staudinger reduction is the organic synthesis of this pinwheel compound:\n\nThe reaction mechanism centers around the formation of an iminophosphorane through nucleophilic addition of the aryl or alkyl phosphine at the terminal nitrogen atom of the organic azide and expulsion of diatomic nitrogen. The iminophosphorane is then hydrolyzed in the second step to the amine and a phosphine oxide byproduct.\n\nOf interest in chemical biology research, the Staudinger ligation is a modification of the classical Staudinger reaction in which an electrophilic trap (usually a methyl ester) is placed on the triaryl phosphine. In aqueous media, the aza-ylide intermediate rearranges, to produce an amide linkage and the phosphine oxide, and is so named the Staudinger ligation because it ligates two molecules together, whereas in the classical Staudinger reaction, the two products are not covalently linked after hydrolysis. A traceless version of the reaction leaves behind no residual atoms and has been used to ligate peptides.\n\nIn one application this reaction is used to create a bond between a nucleoside and a fluorescent marker:\n\nThe Staudinger ligation is used to site-specifically incorporate organic molecules (such as fluorescent dyes) into recombinant polypeptides containing unnatural azide-conjugated aminoacids (incorporated, for instance, via suppression of the amber stop codon: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja027007w)\n\n"}

Set in a small town in Ireland in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Francis \"Francie\" Brady, a schoolboy who retreats into a violent fantasy world as his troubled home life collapses.\n\n\"The Butcher Boy\" won the 1992 \"Irish Times\" Irish Literature Prize for Fiction and was shortlisted for the 1992 Booker Prize.\n\nIn the early part of the book it becomes apparent that Francie's mother is frequently abused both verbally and physically by her husband, Benny, a bitter alcoholic. Francie's mother often considers suicide and is committed for a time to a mental hospital.\n\nFrancie seems largely unaware of the trouble at home, and spends the early part of the book in the company of his best friend Joe Purcell, hiding out in a chicken-house and shouting abuse at the fish in the local stream. The two befriend classmate Phillip Nugent, the son of Francie's sanctimonious neighbour, Mrs. Nugent, but end up stealing his comic books. Francie recalls vividly an episode in which she hurls a torrent of verbal abuse at Francie's mother, claiming that the Brady family are \"a bunch of pigs\". Francie takes this insult to heart, and begins to harass the Nugents when they are walking through the town, denying them access through a certain street until they pay the fictional \"Pig Toll tax\". So begins an unhealthy obsession that underpins the rest of the novel.\n\nWord comes that Francie's uncle Alo, who is something of a local celebrity, is coming to town. A party is arranged and most of the town turns up. Alo arrives and sings with his guests late into the night, and Francie observes his uncle with admiration. Eventually the guests leave, and Benny, drunk as usual, launches a verbal assault at his brother, claiming he is a fake and a liar, to the protestation and horror of Francie's mother. Alo is totally dejected and leaves.\n\nFrancie is horrified at the treatment of Alo, and runs away from home. He spends some time thieving in Dublin, and when he returns he discovers his mother has committed suicide, for which his father blames him. Again, Francie's mind turns to the Nugents. He attempts to harm Phillip after luring him to the chickenhouse, but Joe stops him. Eventually he breaks into the Nugent's house when they are out and pretends to be a pig, defecating on the floor of the Nugent's house. The Nugents interrupt him and call the police.\n\nFrancie is sent to an 'industrial school' run by priests. During the course of his internment he is molested by one of the priests and befriended by a gardener who claims to have been an Old IRA member and close associate of Michael Collins. He claims to have forgotten all about the Nugents, and is determined to get back to town and resume his carefree friendship with Joe.\n\nOn release Francie heads back to town, fully expectant of a friendly welcome by Joe. However he finds it hard to get in touch with his friend, and when he does Joe is reluctant to talk to him. When Francie is attacked by Mrs. Nugent's brother, Buttsy, and his friend Devlin, Joe disowns him.\n\nFrancie gets a job in the local abattoir, impressing the owner with his ability to unflinchingly kill a piglet, and dedicates himself to this job, aiming to make his father proud. He has also begun drinking at weekends with the local drunk, and he goes to clubs with the specific aim of getting into fights. After some months, the police enter his home to discover that his father has been dead for a long time, and Francie is committed to a mental hospital.\n\nAfter he is released, Francie discovers that Joe Purcell is attending boarding school in Bundoran, County Donegal. He decides to go there, and en route he stops off at a boarding house where his father had said he and Francie's mother had spent their honeymoon in bliss. He interrogates the landlady, and she informs him that his father had treated his mother terribly for the duration of their honeymoon. Francie resumes his travels and arrives at Joe's school in the middle of the night. He breaks in and, coming face to face with Joe, discovers that his friend has outgrown him and, worse, befriended Phillip Nugent.\n\nFrancie returns home and resumes his job at the butchers. One day, while on his rounds, he calls at the Nugents' house. Mrs. Nugent answers and Francie forces his way in. He attacks her and shoots her in the head with the butcher's bolt gun. He cuts her open and writes the word 'PIG' over the walls in an upstairs room with her blood. He puts her into the cart in which he transports the offal and meat-waste, covering her body with the detritus. He casually resumes his rounds and makes his way back to the abattoir, where he is apprehended by the police. He leads them on a wild goose chase for Mrs. Nugent's body, and escapes from them for a time, but he is recaptured and eventually imprisoned after revealing where her dismembered corpse is.\n\nThe novel is written in a hybrid of first-person narrative and stream of consciousness, with little punctuation and no separation of dialogue and thought. Guathier, in examining the state of identity in the novel, explains that this style of writing forces the reader to \"constantly [reassess] Francie Brady's psychological (in)stability [...] never quite sure to what extent Francie's perceptions are delusions or are incisive commentary on the narrow community in which he lives.\"\n\nLike many other contemporary and modern pieces of Irish literature, \"The Butcher Boy\" addresses concerns about Ireland's neocolonial status. As Shahriyar Mansouri claims, the novel also examines the rise of a new wave of \"decolonizing anarchic formations\" in Ireland in the late 1960s and the 1970s, identifying split identity and non-conformism as outcries of a nation colonized by a post-colonial State. Critic Tim Guathier asserts that the crisis of identity which Francie experiences throughout the novel stems from the \"unbalanced state\" of Ireland and Irish identity. In particular, Guathier emphasizes that the instability of the community during the sixties—a time of rapid change and political violence within Ireland—shapes his dysfunctional family, and Francie's dysfunctional relationships with other characters such as Joe Purcell, and ensures that Francie does not feel part of the larger community, effectively turning him into the \"Other\".\n\nThe book was adapted into a feature film directed by Neil Jordan in 1997. It starred Eamonn Owens as Francie, Stephen Rea as Benny and Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Nugent. The film was released on DVD on February 13, 2007.\n\nThe film won the Silver Berlin Bear award for Best Director at the Berlin Film Festival in 1998 and a Special Mention for Owens' \"astonishing lead\". It also won the European Film Award for Best Cinematographer for Adrian Biddle.\n\nThe adaptation is mostly faithful to the novel, but there are some differences, the principal change being the ending. In the book, Francie is not seen to leave prison, and attempts to forge a friendship with an inmate similar to the one he had with Joe. In the film, a much older Francie is released from prison at the end to be brought to a halfway house. He picks a snowdrop, echoing the opening of the film.\n\nThis was the final film produced by Geffen Pictures, which distributed its films through Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n"}

He is the only person in any field of music to have been nominated for a Grammy Award for 28 consecutive years. He received 31 total nominations and won 9 Grammy Awards.\n\nJames Webre Blackwood was born on August 4, 1919, in Choctaw County, Mississippi, to sharecropper William Emmett Blackwood and his wife Carrie Prewitt Blackwood. He was the youngest of four children, which included his brother Roy Blackwood (December 24, 1900 – March 21, 1971), sister Lena Blackwood Cain (December 31, 1904 – March 1, 1990), and brother Doyle Blackwood (August 21, 1911 – October 3, 1974).\n\nIn 1926, James and his brother Doyle had developed an interest in gospel music, singing at church gatherings, camp meetings, schools and any place they saw the opportunity. During this period, the brothers sang on WTJS in Jackson, Tennessee.\n\nBlackwood formed a singing group with his nephew R. W. and his brothers Roy and Doyle. The Blackwood Brothers first broadcast was on radio station WHEF, AM 1500, in Kosciusko, Mississippi in 1934. The quartet soon began broadcasting on the larger WJDX in Jackson, Mississippi, later moving to Shreveport, Louisiana in 1939, and Shenandoah, Iowa in 1940.\n\nIn early WWII, the quartet temporarily disbanded as James joined the war effort as a factory welder in California. As the other members joined James in California, they resumed singing and the quartet was based in San Diego, California from 1944 to 1945 as they continued simultaneously working in the war related industries. After the war, they returned to Iowa in September 1945 resuming their broadcast on KMA Radio in Shenandoah. The year 1950 found the quartet moving to Memphis, Tennessee and radio station WMPS.\n\nIn 1951, they signed a recording contract with RCA Victor Records.\n\nSoon they began traveling to their concert appearances by private plane with R.W. Blackwood and bass singer Bill Lyles as pilot and co-pilot. On June 12, 1954, the Blackwood Brothers won first place on the CBS radio and TV program \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts Show\". On June 30, 1954 in Clanton, Alabama, the quartet was preparing for concert at the airport for the Chilton County Peach Festival. During a few practice touch-and-go landings the plane crashed and R. W., Bill Lyles and family friend Johnny Ogburn died in the crash. The quartet re-organized following the plane crash with R. W.'s younger brother, Cecil Blackwood, baritone, and J.D. Sumner, bass. In 1956 the re-organized group appeared on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scout Show and won a second time.\n\nIn the mid-1950s the quartet started traveling in a customized bus, another 'first' for the group.\n\nJames Blackwood, Cecil Blackwood and J. D. Sumner founded the National Quartet Convention in 1957, originally a 3-day event held at Ellis Auditorium in Memphis, Tennessee .\n\nIn 1964, the Blackwood Brothers chartered the Gospel Music Association.\n\nAfter singing with The Blackwood Brothers Quartet for 47 years, James (together with four other veteran gospel singers, Hovie Lister, Jake Hess, J. D. Sumner and Rosie Rozell) formed the Masters V Quartet, the highlight being a joint concert with The Rivertown Boys in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. In 1990 he formed the James Blackwood Quartet along with Ken Turner, Brad White and Ray Shelton. Rosie Rozell would sing tenor in the initial performances, but Larry Ford would quickly become the permanent tenor as Rosie's health deteriorated. This group, like James' preceding groups, would also receive a Grammy nomination.\n\nOn May 4, 1939, James Blackwood married Miriam (Mim) Grantham. The couple had two sons James Jr. and Billy. He died of a stroke on February 3, 2002 in Memphis, Tennessee, and is buried at Forest Hill Cemetery East, in Shelby County, Tennessee.\n\nWin \n\nNomination\n\nDuring his long career, James was probably honored with more awards that any other gospel singer. He is the only person in any field of music to have been nominated for a Grammy award for 28 consecutive years.

{"id": "2237299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237299", "title": "Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter", "text": "Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter\n\nBreath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, known in Japan as , is a PlayStation 2 game originally released on November 14, 2002. It is the fifth role-playing game (RPG) in the \"Breath of Fire\" series.\n\n\"Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter\" is a role-playing video game that takes drastic deviations from previous games in the series, and is the first to be presented using fully three-dimensional graphics for both characters and environments. Players control their characters from a third-person perspective as they navigate through a number of different environments including dangerous areas such as dungeons and towns where they may interact with non-player characters. While previous \"Breath of Fire\" games took place in fantasy environments containing open areas, \"Dragon Quarter\" features a distinct science fiction motif that sets the game in a series of underground bunkers 1000m below the surface in an industrialized, post-apocalyptic environment. As players progress through the game, they must travel upward through a network of tunnels while battling enemies and collecting keys in order to advance. The game uses a map system that alerts players to the location of nearby doors, treasures, and enemies to aid them in navigation.\n\nRather than experiencing the entire game in a single play-through, \"Dragon Quarter\" is designed to encourage the player to play through the title multiple times in order to experience the whole story. Using the Scenario Overlay (SOL) System, certain plot points and areas of the game are only accessible if the player's D-Ratio number is high enough. When players begin the game, their D-Ratio is represented as the fraction 1/8192, and can only be raised by continually restarting the game and using the SOL: Restore function, which allows them to begin a brand-new game while carrying over all accumulated items, equipment, and skills found up until that point. Progress is saved to the PlayStation 2's memory card using limited Save Tokens found during gameplay. Players may also suspend their game as many times as they wish by creating a temporary save at certain areas in the game, which are deleted as soon as they are loaded.\n\nWhen a player reaches a certain point in the game, they obtain the ability to use powerful dragon abilities and receive a D-Counter at the top of the screen represented as a percentage. When the D-Counter reaches 100 percent, the game ends and the player is sent back to their last permanent save. The meter raises continually as the player uses these abilities in or out of battle and can only be lowered by restarting using SOL: Restore.\n\nBattles in \"Dragon Quarter\" use the Positive Encounter and Tactics System (PETS), which is described by Capcom as a \"combined real-time and turn-based combat\". A battle begins when a character comes in contact with an on-screen enemy creature, with the player gaining a pre-emptive strike advantage if they strike the enemy with their weapon beforehand. Players may also avoid combat by setting traps to slow down or stop enemies from approaching, or by leaving food to attract them to it. While in the battle screen, each character and enemy present take action by order of their \"agility\" statistic, with each participant allowed free movement around the battle area during their turn. Characters are given an allocation of Active Points (AP) at the start of each turn, with the number decreasing with each step and attack they make. Attacks are divided into three levels, with higher level attacks costing more AP to use but dealing more damage, and may be strung together into combination attacks. A character may learn new attacks by equipping new weapons and by finding Attack Skills scattered throughout the game. A battle is won either when all enemies are defeated or have fled the battle area, with victories earning the player experience points that allow characters to gain levels and become stronger, along bonus Party Experience awarded based on combat performance.\n\nAn unspecified amount of time before the game begins, humanity fled the desolated surface world to the underground in order to survive. Now, the world lies in a state of turmoil; polluted and stagnant, only the upper classes are able to escape to higher levels with better air. The game follows Ryu, a low level citizen, who rebels against his government in order to save the life of Nina, who is unable to survive underground, due to an experimental surgery performed on her in order to convert her into an air purification machine. According to \"Breath of Fire\" tradition, dragons play a large role in \"Dragon Quarter\", and Ryu himself is able to transform into a dragon. Despite this tradition, however, the main influence of Dragons is felt in the storyline of the game and not the gameplay - unlike every other installment, Ryu can only transform into one Dragon form.\n\nThe focus of the story is on Ryu's escape to the surface with Nina, accompanied by the ever-watchful Lin. A majority of the game simply focuses on Ryu and company's ascent from over a kilometre below the surface to ground level, traversing dark underground passageways and fending off the encounters they find. On the lowest levels one can find those with low \"D-ratios\"; as one ascends the levels, the D-ratio of the inhabitants increases. As the name suggests, D-ratios are expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1; lower numbers in the denominators indicate a higher D-Ratio. As one can see, D-ratio is the main determinant of social status in the world of \"Dragon Quarter\". The highest D-ratio a human can achieve is 1/4 - this is the Dragon Quarter of the title, which represents a one in four chance of linking with an available dragon.\n\nThere are two main subplots in the game; the first one concerns the six mysterious rulers of the entire underground world, who seem to be ubiquitous in their ability to gain information and their ability to act on this information. These rulers also reveal the storyline via a legend passed down that says a boy with the power to become a dragon will bring the world back to the surface. The other subplot is introduced almost at the outset of the game: a rivalry between Ryu and Bosch, the latter of which is portrayed as an entitled, monomaniacal elitist. Bosch initially wishes to use Ryu as his lackey in order to attain a higher rank, due to his (Bosch's) high D-ratio of 1/64. Early on in the story, Bosch inadvertently releases Ryu's ability to become a dragon when he tries to kill Ryu; after he has seen this power, Bosch's will to beat Ryu in battle drives him to undergo experimental dragon fusion, eventually resulting in his ability to become a dragon as well.\n\nRyu's entire struggle comes to a head as he is forced to invade the upper levels of the underground to lead Nina to the clean air she needs to survive. Three of the five regents which govern the entire world Ryu knows fall beneath his blade before he comes face to face with Elyon, also known as \"Origin\", the leader of the Regeants and the first host of the dragon Odjn. Elyon acknowledges Ryu's power, noting that none have ever come closer to reclaiming the surface world than he. He then summons two pieces of himself he banished away to extend his life, using his newly rediscovered power to attack Ryu, Nina and Lin. After a fierce battle, Elyon lays defeated and Ryu notes that Elyon was \"Odjn's first\", heavily alluding to the fact that Elyon was directly responsible for Mankind not reclaiming the sky hundreds of years ago because he feared to push his power to the limit. With their final obstacle out of the way, Ryu, Lin and Nina venture forth to the hatch itself. There Bosch catches up with them, now containing his own true dragon, Chetyre, instead of a mere construct. He and Ryu clash for one final time before Bosch is truly defeated. Seeming to give up, Bosch gives himself over to Chertyre and allows the dragon to manifest himself fully in the world again. Ryu, faced with a true dragon and Odjn's power ready to kill him, is forced to ignore the possibility of death and use his own D-Breath attack to channel Odjn's power against Chertyre. It is important to note that this brings his D-Counter to 100%, something to be avoided at all costs during other points in the game. From this point, which should kill him, Ryu channels more and more of Odjn's power, his D-Counter rising far above 100%, and finally defeats Chertyre and opens the way to the surface. As he lays dying, Ryu tells Lin and Nina to go on ahead, that he'll catch up with them in a moment.\n\nAs Nina and Lin walk up the spiral staircase to the surface, Odjn appears, asking if Ryu has any regrets. Ryu replies that he has none, stating that reaching the surface was his only goal. Odjn exhults, telling Ryu that it was not his power which brought Ryu this far, but his own determination. As Lin and Nina grieve, Odjn restores Ryu's life to him. What the three of them would do for the rest of their lives on the now pure, lush and green surface world would remain a mystery.\n\n\"Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter\" was first announced by Capcom at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles as the first game in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2 console. The project was headed by series veteran Makoto Ikehara, who served as director, and was inspired to create the game's dystopian setting after reading the 1994 alternate history novel \"Gofungo no Sekai\" (五分後の世界, \"lit. The World Five Minutes From Now\") by Ryū Murakami. The game's unique gameplay elements and high challenge were added to differentiate it from previous entries in the series, which Ikehara felt were \"too easy\" when compared to other role-playing titles, with the level of difficulty gradually increasing as development went on. Character design was handled by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who had provided official artwork for all previous \"Breath of Fire\" games, and who specifically designed the character Elyon after the main antagonist of the previous game, Fou-Lu, because he \"wanted to use the character again\". In order to give the dragons Odjn, Dover, and Chetyre their own distinct identity, they were made to speak Russian during cutscenes and were named after the Russian numbers one (один, \"adeen\"), two (два, \"dva\"), and four (четыре, \"chyetirye\"), respectively. Unlike the protagonists of previous \"Breath of Fire\" games, each also named Ryu, the Ryu in this game is a normal human being characterized by Yoshikawa as \"an average person like you might find anywhere\" with his only extraordinary ability being his strong will and sense of justice. In November 2002, the game was released in Japan under its regional title, \"Breath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter\", and was dedicated to the memory of Capcom employee Yasuhito Okada.\n\nA number of intended features were cut from the final version of the game, including an online mode which was dropped early in development that would have made use of the PlayStation 2's internet capabilities, as well as a fishing minigame similar to earlier titles in the series. The dragon Odjn was originally conceived as a \"cutesy\" companion to Ryu and his team before becoming large and menacing, with his early design instead going to Cupid's pet Oncotte. Certain story points that the development team deemed too \"shocking\" were also removed before the game was completed, including a locked room in the Biocorp Labs that contained headless duplicate bodies of Nina, and the scientist who performed Nina's operation resembling Adolf Hitler. Ikehara noted that he also originally wanted to include a cutscene in the game showing how the surface world became uninhabitable, but was ultimately unable to do so.\n\nOne week before the game's release in Japan, Capcom USA announced that it would be releasing \"Dragon Quarter\" in North America in February 2003. This version would later appear at the 2003 Game Developers Conference under its official English title that excluded the numeral \"V\". The game would be released in Europe in November 2003. For unknown reasons however this version featured a few changes in the game's mechanics. The soft save function was removed from the game entirely, so the only way to save the game was creating hard save files by using save tokens. To compensate for this the player can find roughly twice as many save tokens throughout the game.\n\nOn February 16, 2016, Breath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store as a \"PS2 Archives\" digital title for PlayStation 3. The title was delisted from the store in early 2019.\n\nThe music of \"Dragon Quarter\" was composed by series newcomer Hitoshi Sakimoto, who had previously contributed the soundtracks for other role-playing titles such as \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" and the \"\" series, along with sound producer Yasunori Mitsuda who oversaw the development of each track. A special five-song promotional album called the \"Breath of Fire V Dragon Quarter Mini Image Soundtrack\" was given away to attendees of the 2002 Tokyo Game Show and sold on Capcom's online store to promote the title, with a full commercial soundtrack for the game released in December 2002 by Capcom's music label Suleputer across two discs. \"Dragon Quarter\" features the vocal song \"Castle・imitation\" by J-pop performer Chihiro Onitsuka as the game's ending theme, which was later included on her 2002 album \"Sugar High\". In 2006, the game's soundtrack was re-printed as part of the 11-disc \"Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box\", which contains music from every game in the series.\n\n\"Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter\" was the top-selling game in Japan during the week of its release in November 2002 at 80,059 copies. It would go on to sell a total of 140,073 copies by the end of that year, enough to qualify the title for a re-release in July 2003 under Sony's \"PlayStation the Best\" label at a lower price. The game was given an 8.5 out of 10 average by Japanese \"Hyper PlayStation 2\" magazine, and a 32 out of 40 score by \"Weekly Famitsu\", earning it the magazine's silver award.\n\nMany North American reviewers would comment on the drastic changes made between \"Dragon Quarter\" and earlier games in the \"Breath of Fire\" series, with \"Game Informer\" claiming that \"If anything, Dragon Quarter will likely tear the Breath of Fire fan base apart...it's unlike anything you've experienced before\" and IGN calling it \"a tough pill to swallow for returning fans.\" IGN would praise the title's \"enormous\" combat strategy, steam punk atmosphere, and soundtrack, calling the game's musical score \"pure genius\", but found its playtime of roughly ten hours to be low, calling it the \"perfect RPG rental.\" GameSpot conversely felt that, while \"Dragon Quarter\"'s combat system was enjoyable at first, it became less tactical as the game progressed, and that it \"devolves into the sorts of slugfests typical of RPGs.\" The website would commend the title's graphics, however, calling the character designs \"inspired\" and that the characters themselves \"express realistic emotions\" which accentuate the game's serious tone. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" would also call attention to the game's new battle system, stating that \"[we] don't think [we]'ve ever had as much fun with RPG battles before,\" but felt that the game's pacing hindered its story. \"GamePro\" called the game \"an RPG sequel that couldn't be more different if it tried\", commending its new \"astonishing\" combat, but felt that the forced repetition of the Scenario Overlay system and likely having the play through the game several times to see all the content was its biggest downfall. TechTV similarly felt that the game's restart mechanics will either \"inspire you or drive you mad\", but found its \"unique combat\" and \"attractive visuals\" to all be positive factors.\n\nEuropean reviewers would similarly comment on the game's deviation from role-playing game standards. \"Play\" magazine found most of the changes to be beneficial, stating that \"[we] wanted something different too, but what [we] got instead is marvelous.\" Others such as \"Edge\", however, found its innovations to be mixed, but overall good, saying \"Such bastard generic cross-pollination will be of keen interest to those who have pigeonholed the console RPG as yesterday's bread, as Dragon Quarter variously succeeds in its misfit marriage.\" The title would ultimately receive mostly positive reviews, with a 78% average score from the aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic. \"Dragon Quarter\" would later be nominated for \"Best Original Music in a Game\" during GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2003 awards, and in 2004, IGN ranked the game 6th on its list of the \"Top 12 Hidden Gems for the PlayStation 2\", which included games that sold less than 135,000 copies in North America, or less than half of one percent of the console's user base, stating that \"For one of the most popular role-playing franchises in the entire 32-bit era, the lackluster performance of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is nothing short of surprising.\".\n"}
{"id": "2237309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237309", "title": "Cohesion (chemistry)", "text": "Cohesion (chemistry)\n\nCohesion (from Latin \"cohaesiō\" \"cling\" or \"unity\") or cohesive attraction or cohesive force is the action or property of like molecules sticking together, being mutually attractive. It is an intrinsic property of a substance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules, which makes the distribution of surrounding electrons irregular when molecules get close to one another, creating electrical attraction that can maintain a microscopic structure such as a water drop. In other words, cohesion allows for surface tension, creating a \"solid-like\" state upon which light-weight or low-density materials can be placed.\n\nWater, for example, is strongly cohesive as each molecule may make four hydrogen bonds to other water molecules in a tetrahedral configuration. This results in a relatively strong Coulomb force between molecules. In simple terms, the polarity (state in which a molecule is oppositely charged on its poles) of water molecules allows them to be attracted towards each other. The polarity is due to the electronegativity of the atom of oxygen: oxygen is more electronegative than the atoms of hydrogen, so the electrons they share through the covalent bonds are more often close to oxygen rather than hydrogen. These are called polar covalent bonds, covalent bonds between atoms that thus become oppositely charged. In the case of a water molecule, the hydrogen atoms carry positive charges while the oxygen atom has a negative charge. This charge polarization within the molecule allows it to align with adjacent molecules through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, rendering the bulk liquid cohesive. Van der Waals gases such as methane, however, have weak cohesion due only to van der Waals forces that operate by induced polarity in non-polar molecules.\n\nCohesion, along with adhesion (attraction between unlike molecules), helps explain phenomena such as meniscus, surface tension and capillary action.\n\nMercury in a glass flask is a good example of the effects of the ratio between cohesive and adhesive forces. Because of its high cohesion and low adhesion to the glass, mercury does not spread out to cover the bottom of the flask, and if enough is placed in the flask to cover the bottom, it exhibits a strongly convex meniscus, whereas the meniscus of water is concave. Mercury will not wet the glass, unlike water and many other liquids, and if the glass is tipped, it will 'roll' around inside.\n\n\n"}

It is essentially a modification of the widely deployed B61 weapon, which forms the basis of most of the current US stockpile of nuclear gravity bombs. The very similar W84 warhead was deployed on the retired BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile.\n\nThe W80 is physically quite small: the physics package itself is about the size of a conventional Mk.81 bomb, in diameter and long, and only slightly heavier at about .\n\nArmorers have the ability to select the yield of the resulting explosion in-flight, a capability referred to as variable yield, colloquially referred to as \"dial-a-yield\". The minimum yield, perhaps using just the boosted fission primary, is around 5 kilotons of TNT; the highest yield is equivalent to around .\n\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory began development on the W80 in June 1976, with the brief of producing a custom weapon for the cruise missiles then under construction. With \"the basic design\" being derived from the B61. The main design differences are presumably a smaller secondary producing only 150 kt yield (the B61 producing a maximum of 170kt in the tactical variants and 340kt in the strategic variants) and simplification of the design giving the weapon only two yield settings; 5 and 150 kt.\n\nProduction of the W80 mod 1 (W80-1) to arm the ALCM started in January 1979, and a number of warheads had been completed by January 1981 when the first low-temperature test was carried out. To everyone's surprise the test delivered a much lower yield than was expected, apparently due to problems in the TATB based insensitive high explosives used to fire the primary. This problem turned out to affect several models of the B61-based line, and production of all weapons was suspended while a solution was worked on. Production restarted in February 1982.\n\nIn March 1982, designers began working on a W80 variant intended for the Navy's Tomahawk program. The W80 mod 0 (W80-0) used \"supergrade\" fission fuel, which has less radioactivity, in the primary in place of the conventional plutonium used in the Air Force's version. \"Supergrade\" is industry parlance for plutonium alloy bearing an exceptionally high fraction of Pu-239 (>95%), leaving a very low amount of Pu-240 which is a gamma emitter in addition to being a high spontaneous fission isotope. Such plutonium is produced from fuel rods that have been irradiated a very short time as measured in MW-Day/Ton burnup. Such low irradiation times limit the amount of additional neutron capture and therefore buildup of alternate isotope products such as Pu-240 in the rod, and also by consequence is considerably more expensive to produce, needing far more rods irradiated and processed for a given amount of plutonium. Submarine crew members routinely operate in proximity to stored weapons in torpedo rooms, in contrast to the air force where exposure to warheads is relatively brief. The first models were delivered in December 1983 and the Mod 0 went into full production in March 1984.\n\nProduction of the W80 was completed by September 1990, although the exact date at which the respective Mod 0 and Mod 1 runs ended is not clear. A total of 1750 Mod 1 and 367 Mod 0 devices were delivered; 1,000 Mod 1 devices were deployed on the original ALCM, another 400 on the later ACM, and 350 Mod 0s on the Tomahawk.\n\nSome of the original ALCMs would later have their mod 1 warheads removed and instead be fitted with conventional warheads producing the CALCM conversion. Under START II only 400 ACMs would have retained their nuclear warheads, and the rest would have been converted to CALCMs and their warheads removed to the inactive stockpile.\n\nOn August 30, 2007, six cruise missiles armed with W80-1 warheads were mistakenly loaded onto a B-52 and flown from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on a mission to transport cruise missiles for decommissioning. It was not discovered that the six missiles had nuclear warheads until the plane landed at Barksdale, leaving the warheads unaccounted for over 36 hours. This was the first time since 1968 that nuclear warheads were publicly revealed to have been transported on a US bomber. The munitions crews involved in mistakenly loading the nuclear warheads at Minot were temporarily decertified from performing their duties involving nuclear munitions. \n\nIn 2014 a life extension program for the W80-1 was started and the LEP warhead was given the W80-4 designation. The warhead will be used on the ALCM and a new LRSO cruise missile. First production unit is estimated in 2025 and production should finish in 2031. According to public descriptions of the program, the warhead will offer no increased military capability, only refurbishing and updating components, and increasing weapon safety and reliability.\n\n\n\n"}

The intertwining of the two results in the destruction of Raphael and the dramatic change of Malachy.\n\nMalachy Dudgeon comes from a small suburban Irish town, from a dysfunctional family, existing under the guise of happiness, using the facade of happy Sunday mornings, whilst the adulteress mother and suicidal father continue to make devastating blows to their son, from which he never truly recovers, and chooses to escape into his world of imaginations, dreams and Americanisms.\n\nOn the other hand, Raphael Bell comes from a small rural Irish town, and is the apparent picture of perfection. Raphael constantly seeks attention, from singing: \"Wee Hughie\" at any available moment to succeeding at school. However Raphael's world is gravely affected when Black and Tan soldiers shoot his father in the chest before his eyes. From this moment on Raphael strives to uphold the virtues and traditions of old Ireland, and it is inevitably this inability to transgress and adjust into modern living that leads, unsurprisingly to his suicide.\n\nThe two protagonists become inextricably linked when Malachy joins the teaching staff at Raphael's prestigious boys boarding school, which he sees as his whole life's worth. An unfortunate science trip leads to the drowning of school boy, Pat Hourican and the unravelling of both Malachy and Raphael. Malachy loses his job, and then his girlfriend, Marion, to a wild member of a rock-band, and Raphael loses his job and mind, and then subsequently his wife, Nessa dies.\n\nWhilst Malachy becomes a waster and alcoholic and moves to London, Raphael opens what he calls 'The Dead School'. With black bin bags at the windows and an uncontrollable amount of mess and disorder. He begins to teach imaginary classes about his own life, as madness becomes inherent in his everyday life.\n\nAs the novel concludes, Raphael's suicide occurs, as does his unattended funeral. Malachy returns to his hometown to care for his incapacitated mother, whom he once loathed, and there is a general air of depression, as the golden age of Ireland which Raphael had once loved is exchanged for stripjoints and graffiti. A downright thing.\n\nThroughout the novel the narrator becomes more of a character in his own right, making allusions to his opinions, which constantly change, as the omniscient voice chooses to blame a variety of people for the disastrous events. The colloquial narrative is also crucial in building the narrators persona, and also adds to the idea of base culture, something around which the novel is centered. Many critics have hailed McCabe's novel as a member, or rather cornerstone of the subgenre \"Bog Gothic\". This refers to the specialist Irish Gothic, which has been penned for McCabe's novels.\n"}

Kindelberger\n\nJames Howard \"Dutch\" Kindelberger (May 8, 1895 – July 27, 1962) was an American aviation pioneer. He led North American Aviation from 1934 until 1960. An extroverted character, Kindelberger was famed for his emphasis on hard work, orderliness and punctuality.\n\nKindelberger was born on May 8, 1895, in Wheeling, West Virginia, to Charles Frederick Kindelberger, a steelworker and Rose Ann Kindelberger.\n\nKindelberger dropped out of school in the 10th grade and started working in the steel industry with his father. He took correspondence courses to further his education. In 1916, when he was 21 years old, he went to study at the Carnegie Institute of Technology to pursue engineering.\n\nHis nickname, 'Dutch' referred to his descent from German (\"Deutsch\") immigrants from Nothweiler, Pfalz.\n\nIn 1919, he married Thelma Knarr and they had two children.\n\nDuring World War I, Kindelberger was a member of the US Army Air Service. He was a pilot instructor based at Park Field in Memphis, Tennessee. After the war, Kindelberger looked for work in aviation. In 1920, became chief draftsman and assistant chief engineer with the Glenn L. Martin Company in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nKindelberger formed a lifelong working association with J. L. \"Lee\" Atwood when they met as young engineers at Douglas Aircraft Company in 1930, working on the DC-1 and DC-2 transports. Kindelberger worked as chief engineer and remained with Douglas for nine years.\n\nThe two left Douglas Aircraft in 1934, moving to North American Aviation. Atwood assumed the title of Chief Engineer, and Kindelberger was named President and General Manager. When they started at NAA, the company had orders for one passenger aircraft. Kindelberger managed to get a $1 million order for a military trainer, the North American BT-9.\n\nIn the summer of 1941, while United States was still a non-participant in World War II, the British Air Ministry asked North American Aviation to build Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters for the Royal Air Force, since the total output of the Curtiss factory was earmarked for USA military use. Kindelberger told his UK contacts that North American could create a better design, and completed the prototype of the P-51 Mustang in four months. \nIn all, 42,000 aircraft were built by the company by the end of the war.\n\nAfter World War II Atwood expected there would be a need for improved rocket engines based on those developed by the Germans for the V-2. The two decided in 1946 to invest $1 million in a rocket engine test facility in Santa Susana, California, and a supersonic wind tunnel at Los Angeles International Airport. This paid off when North American landed the contract to develop the Navaho, a rocket-boosted intercontinental cruise missile.\n\nKindelberger was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer in 1948, with Atwood replacing him as president.\nThe Navaho project allowed North American to develop expertise in rocket engines, inertial navigation systems, and supersonic aerodynamics. This in turn led to securing contracts for many advanced aerospace vehicles in the late 1950s – the X-15 manned hypersonic spaceplane, the Hound Dog missile, and the XB-70 Valkyrie triple-sonic bomber. The XB-70 required the company to develop new materials, welding, and manufacturing processes.\n\nIn 1960, Kindelberger retired and Atwood took over as Chief Executive. Kindelberger remained Chairman of the Board until his death in July 27, 1962, due to congestive heart failure at the age of 67. Dr Toby Freedman was his personal doctor and Medical Director at NAA. Dr Freedman was with Kindelberger when he died. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

The song, written and produced by L.A. Reid and Babyface, was released by Arista Records as the lead single from the album. The single features a B-side, \"Feels So Good\", which has not been featured on any Whitney Houston album. While the original version, produced by L.A. Reid and Babyface, was released in the United States, the Yvonne Turner mix (also known as the \"European Version\" or the \"International Version\"), was released in other countries.\n\n“I’m Your Baby Tonight” became a huge hit for Houston, reaching top-ten positions worldwide. It reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, her eighth single to do so; \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" is also her fifth biggest hit in the United States. “I’m Your Baby Tonight” was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Houston was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance with this song at the 33rd Grammy Awards.\n\nA live performance was included in the 2014 CD/DVD release \"\".\n\n\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" is written in the key of A minor (recorded in G-sharp minor) with a tempo of 110 beats per minute in compound quadruple meter ( time). The song follows a chord progression of AmFmajBmEE, and Houston's vocals span from C to A.\n\n\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics, being named as a stand-out track from the parent album by AllMusic, while \"Entertainment Weekly\" said it \"tries too hard to follow in the footsteps of Michael Jackson's 'The Way You Make Me Feel.'\" \"Music & Media\" commented that the song is a \"sure hit\" and noted that its \"moody dance beat, soberly orchestrated, and a prominent piano form the basis for La Houston's chilling vocals.\"\nFollowing Houston's death in 2012, \"Entertainment Weekly\" published a list of Houston's 25 best songs and ranked \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" at number 18. BET placed it at number 23 in their list of \"The 40 Best Whitney Houston Songs\", writing that the producers \"deliver a streetwise production\" which gives Houston \"a perfect launchpad for one of the funkier, harder-edged performances of her career\". Slant Magazine ranked this as the second best Whitney Houston song.\n\n\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" hit the top-ten in several major markets, including Greece (#1), Iceland (#1), Italy (#1), Belgium (#2), Canada (#2), Finland (#2), Austria (#3), Norway (#3), France (#4), Switzerland (#4), Germany (#5) and United Kingdom (#5). After having charted ten top-ten hits (and seven consecutive number-one's) on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, Houston continued her chart momentum as \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" would become her 11th top-ten hit and eighth number-one single. The single had an impressive debut at number 42 the week of October 20, 1990. Six weeks later it hit the number-one spot, ending Mariah Carey's three-week run at the top with \"Love Takes Time\". \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" spent one week at number-one, being knocked off by Stevie B's \"Because I Love You (The Postman Song)\". It also reached number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for two weeks. \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" was Houston's eighth number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, sixth number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Airplay chart and fourth number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nThe video, directed by Julien Temple, features an edgier, rougher version of Houston – very different from in videos such as \"How Will I Know\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" – paying homage to the sounds of black music that have helped define her sound, paying tribute in simulation of the Harlem Renaissance (with Houston as Marlene Dietrich in \"Morocco\"), Motown (most notably The Supremes as Houston uses cloning imagery to create two clones of herself), and Hollywood's Golden Age (with Houston dressed as Audrey Hepburn in \"Funny Face\"), finally returning to present day by the video's end. Two versions of the video exist; one uses the single edit of the song, and the other is the album version, whereas all of Houston's subsequent greatest-hits compilations have usually used the album version.\n\n\n\n"}

Harris led his team to win the silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics.\n\nRelatively unknown due to the shadows cast out of Ontario in the form of superstars Russ Howard, Ed Werenich and Wayne Middaugh, and having not qualified to a Brier out of Ontario yet, Harris rose to stardom when he skipped his team of Richard Hart, Collin Mitchell and George Karrys to a win at the Canadian Olympic trials in 1997, qualifying the team for the 1998 Winter Olympics. They would defeat the favored Kevin Martin 6-5 in the trials final, after a 7-2 round robin record had the team sole 1st and a direct bye to the final.\n\nAt the Olympics, Harris' team dominated throughout, while other pre-Olympic favourites such as reigning World Champions Sweden (skipped by Peja Lindholm) and reigning World silver medalist and European Champions Germany (skipped by Andy Kapp) struggled and were never in playoff contention. Harris lost only one game in the round-robin (a meaningless final game to three-time World Champion and 1988 Olympic Gold medalist Eigil Ramsfjell, skipping Norway). They would win their semi final over the U.S team skipped by Tim Somerville 7-1, in a game conceded after 8 ends, before losing in a major upset in the gold medal final against the surprise finalists, Team Switzerland skipped by Patrick Hürlimann, who they had easily beaten 8-3 in the round robin. Harris was ill during the final game, which many attribute to why they had lost. He shot at only 25% in the final, and even had to take several short breaks on the sideline throughout due to lack of physical energy. However, he was not the only one to struggle in the gold medal game, third Richard Hart shot only 58% and second Collin Mitchell an uncharacteristic 73% (though lead George Karrys was stellar at 98%).\n\nPrior to the Olympics, Harris' only claim to fame on the national curling scene had been a 6-5 record at the 1986 Canadian Junior Men's Curling Championship and a 4-7 record at the 1989 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship. After the 1998 Olympics, Harris skipped a team to the 2004 Nokia Brier where they finished 6-5.\n\nHarris continues to curl competitively, and is now also a curling commentator for the CBC and a golf professional. Mike recently played a large role in the Telus Skins Game, where he coordinated the Pro-Am tournament.\n\n"}

Located southeast of Medicine Hat, it became Canada's first interprovincial park in 1989.\n\nThe park consists of two protected areas, the west block, that straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan boundary between Alberta Highway 41, the townsite of Elkwater, Saskatchewan Highway 615, Saskatchewan Highway 271 and Fort Walsh, and the centre block, an additional area of in Saskatchewan, west of Saskatchewan Highway 21.\n\nThe Cypress Hills plateau rises up to 200 metres above the surrounding prairie, \nto a maximum elevation of at \"Head of the Mountain\" at the west end in Alberta, making it Canada's highest point between the Canadian Rockies and the Labrador peninsula. Eastward across the boundary is the highest point in Saskatchewan, at . The \"West Block\" of the Cypress Hills spans the provincial boundary. Battle Creek runs through the central part of the park. Although the hills seem relatively low, in a larger geographic context the plateau does rise gradually from many kilometres away so that the total elevation gain from Medicine Hat is approximately 600 metres.\n\nApproximately 700 species of plants and animals thrive in the park, including 14 species of orchids.\n\nThere are 5 species of large hoofed mammals found in the park: Wapiti, Mule Deer, White-tailed Deer, Pronghorn, and Bison.\n\nOther mammals found in Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park include:\n\nThe park protects the majority of the Cypress Hills landscape, which consists of three separate elevated blocks of lush forest and fescue grassland surrounded by dry mixed-grass prairie. The \"west block\" and \"centre block\" are protected as provincial parks, and are managed by Alberta Parks and Protected Areas and Saskatchewan Parks, respectively. The \"east block\" of the Cypress Hills, situated near Eastend, Saskatchewan, is not a park or protected area. The \"Fort Walsh National Historic Site\" is also located adjacent to the \"west block\".\n\nFish species include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, brook, brown, westslope cutthroat and rainbow trout, burbot, common carp, white sucker, and shorthead redhorse.\n\nOn the Alberta side of the west block, key park features include Head of the Mountain Viewpoint, the highest point between the Rocky Mountains and Labrador, the Elkwater townsite (a cottage community sitting at the same elevation as the Banff townsite), Horseshoe Canyon and Reesor Lake viewpoints (offering 100 km views on a clear day), over 50 km of hiking and mountain biking trails, and Hidden Valley Ski Area. Three lakes sit on the Alberta side of the park (Elkwater Lake, Spruce Coulee Reservoir and Reesor Lake), with another four in Saskatchewan (Harris, Adams, Coulee Lake and Loch Leven).\n\nAll year long, park interpreters present education programs to school and youth groups, adult and seniors groups, and a wide range of park visitors.\n\nThere are also various rentals to be used in the park in the various months. In summertime, kayak, canoe, bicycle, and stand up paddle boards are available for rental. In the winter, kicksleds, snowshoes, skates and cross country skis may be rented.\n\n\n\n"}

A more common name for them is the plasmodiophorids, but this does not always include \"Phagomyxa\" (see taxobox).\n\nThey typically develop within plant cells, causing the infected tissue to grow into a gall or scab. Important diseases caused by phytomyxeans include club root in cabbage and its relatives, and powdery scab in potatoes. These are caused by species of \"Plasmodiophora\" and \"Spongospora\", respectively.\n\nThe vegetative form is a multinucleate cell, called a plasmodium. This ultimately divides to form new spores, which are released when the host's cells burst. Both resting spores and motile zoospores, which generally have two smooth flagella, are produced at different stages. Within the plasmodium, dividing nuclei have a distinctive cross-like appearance.\n\nPlasmodiophorids are traditionally considered slime moulds, because of the plasmodial stage. Thus they are often classified as fungi, and given names such as the Plasmodiophoromycota.

{"id": "2237372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237372", "title": "Political campaign staff", "text": "Political campaign staff\n\nPolitical campaign staff are the people who formulate and implement the strategy needed to win an election. Many people have made careers out of working full-time for campaigns and groups that support them, but in other campaigns much of the staff might be unpaid volunteers. These differ from political consultants, who do not work for the campaign full-time but provide paid assistance in the form of advice and creative expertise.\n\nThis article provides a generic description of a campaign's staff and organization, based on United States political campaigns. Different campaigns have different structures.\n\nCampaigns are usually overseen by a campaign manager. The campaign manager coordinates the campaign making sure that the rest of the staff and the campaign's consultants are focused effectively on winning the election. In small local campaigns, the campaign manager will often be the only paid staff member and will be responsible for every aspect of the campaign that is not covered by the candidate or volunteers. In larger campaigns, such as a United States presidential campaign, hundreds of staff members will cover the required tasks. While campaign managers are often the lead strategists in local campaigns, in the United States larger campaigns hire consultants to serve as strategists and the campaign manager focuses mostly on coordinating the campaign staff. Campaign managers will often have deputies who oversee various aspects of the campaign at a closer level.\n\nDirectly below the campaign manager on the organization chart is the deputy campaign manager and directly below them are department directors who coordinate specific aspects of the campaign. These staff members often have deputies as well.\n\nIn some campaigns, an executive chairman of the campaign committee will be appointed. The responsibility of an executive chairman will vary widely by campaign, usually an executive chairman is a consultant on internal matters such as campaign staff appointments and major internal policy.\n\nBelow the department level, campaigns vary widely in their structure. On larger campaigns, there will be various coordinators for certain functions within each department. For example, within the fundraising department, there might be a staff member who focuses only on direct mail fundraising.\n\nThe foundation of the campaign structure are the interns and volunteers. Their tasks can include addressing envelopes, entering data into databases, and canvassing voters on behalf of the campaign.\n\nThe field department focuses on the \"on-the-ground\" organizing that is required in order to personally contact voters through canvassing, phone calls, and building local events. Voter contact helps construct and clean the campaign's voter file in order to help better target voter persuasion and identify which voters a campaign most wants to bring out on election day. Field is generally also tasked with running local \"storefront\" campaign offices as well as organizing phone banks and staging locations for canvasses and other campaign events.\n\nOn the statewide level, field departments are generally organized by geography with an overall statewide field director who oversees the efforts of several regional field directors who in turn manage several local offices. \n\nOther field workers below this level include:\n\n\nIn addition to voter persuasion and voter identification, field staff will often provide information for the campaign headquarters as to what is going on in the communities they work in. Field staffers are the primary liaison between the campaign and local influentials such as interest group leaders and prominent community activists. Field departments are also often primarily responsible for the local distribution of \"swag\" i.e. lawn signs, bumper stickers, buttons, and other such materials.\n\nThe communications department oversees both the press relations and advertising involved in promoting the campaign in the media. They are responsible for the campaign's message and image among the electorate. Press releases, advertisements, phone scripts, and other forms of communication must be approved by this department before they can be released to the public. The staffers within this office vary widely from campaign to campaign. However, they generally include:\n\n\n\nResearching and developing a set of policies requires a large team to research and write each plank. Researchers also provide information to the campaign on issues and the backgrounds of candidates (including the candidate they work for) in order to be aware of skeletons in the various candidates' closets. The latter practice is known as opposition research. On smaller campaigns this is often folded into the communications department.\n\nThe finance department coordinates the campaign's fundraising operation and ensures that the campaign always has the money it needs to operate effectively. The techniques employed by this campaign vary based on the campaign's needs and size. Small campaigns often involve casual fundraising events and phone calls from the candidate to donors asking for money. Larger campaigns will include everything from high-priced sit-down dinners to e-mail messages to donors asking for money.\n\nThe legal department makes sure that the campaign is in compliance with the law and files the appropriate forms with government authorities. In Britain and other Commonwealth countries, such as Canada and India, each campaign must have an official agent, who is legally responsible for the campaign and is obligated to make sure the campaign follows all rules and regulations.\n\nThis department will also be responsible for all financial tracking, including bank reconciliations, loans and backup for in-kind donations. They are generally required to keep both paper and electronic files. Small campaigns will often have one person responsible for financial disclosure while larger campaigns will have dozens of lawyers and treasurers making sure that the campaign's activities are legal. After the election, the compliance and legal department must still respond to audit requests and, when required, debt retirement.\n\n\nThe technology department designs and maintains campaign technology such as voter file, websites, and social media. While local (county, city, town, or village) campaigns might have volunteers who know how to use computers, state and national campaigns will have information technology professionals across the state or country handling everything from websites to blogs to databases.\n\nThe scheduling and advance department makes sure that the candidate and campaign surrogates are effectively scheduled so as to maximize their influence on voters. This department also oversees the advance people who arrive at events before the candidate to make sure everything is in order. Often, this department will be a part of the field department.\n\nOn small campaigns the scheduling coordinator may be responsible for developing and executing events. The scheduling coordinator typically manages the candidate's personal and campaign schedule, field and advance team schedules, and gathers important information about all events the campaign and candidate will attend.\n"}

In common with those movements, the feral phenomenon can be seen as part of the wider counterculture.\nIn Australia, the ferals are often seen as an amalgam of the punk and hippie subcultures, with a radical environmental philosophy. The movement, during the 1990s, was the subject of national attention, and as a phenomenon has been the subject of anthropological attention as a characteristically Australian \"alternative lifestyle\".\n\n\"Going Tribal\", a documentary by Light Source Films, examined the subculture in 1995.\n\nThe feral movement is strongly associated with radical environmentalism and a communal lifestyle, with many members residing on multiple occupancy properties. In common with the hippies before them, many members of the feral movement rely on a system of crash pads, squats, and extended networks of \"friends of friends\" throughout Australia to travel with a minimum of financial outlay. Although the itinerant lifestyle and environmental beliefs most associated with the feral movement are akin to those of the earlier hippie movement, the ferals adopted a confrontational, politically charged style of dress, music, and philosophy more often associated with the punk movement.\n\n\n"}

Bad luck surrounds her until he finds temporary contentment with a married politician who acts as a sugar daddy. The latter is killed by either the IRA or the Ulster Defence Volunteers, leaving Braden alone once again.

Such replicas are also preferred to real firearms when used as a prop in a film or stage performance, generally for safety reasons.\n\nA prop replica is an authentic-looking duplicate of a prop from a video game, movie or television show.\n\n\"Replicas represent a copy or forgery of another object and we often think of forgeries we think of paintings but, in fact, anything that is collectible and expensive is an attractive item to forge\".\n\nReplicas have been made by people to preserve a perceived link to the past. This can be linked to a historical past or specific time-period or just to commemorate an experience. Replicas and reproductions of artifacts help provide a material representation of the past for the public. \n\nReplicas of artifacts and art have a purpose within museums and research. They are created to help with preserving of original artifacts. In many cases the original artifact may be too frail and be to much at risk of further damage on display posing a risk to the artifact from light damage, environmental agents, and other risks greater than in secure storage.\n\nReplicas are created for the purpose of experimental archaeology where archaeologists and material analysts try to understand the ways that an artifact was created and what technologies and skills were needed for the people to create the artifact on display.\n\nAnother reason for the creation of replica artifacts, is for museums to be able to send originals around the globe or allow other museums or events to educate people on the history of specific artifacts. Replicas are also put on display in museums when further research is being conducted on the artifact, but further display of the artifact in real or replica form is important for public access and knowledge.\n\nReplicas and their original representation can be seen as fake or real depending on the viewer. Good replicas take much education related to understanding all the processes and history that go behind the culture and the original creation. To create a good and authentic replica of an object, there is to be a skilled artisan or forger to create the same authentic experience that the original object provides. This process takes time and much money to be done correctly for museum standards.\n\nAuthenticity or real feeling presented by an object can be “described as the experience of an ‘aura’ of an original.” An aura of an object is what an object represents through its previous history and experience.\n\nReplicas work well in museum settings because they have the ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel the authentic feelings that they are supposed to get from the originals. Through the context and experience that a replica can provide in a museum setting, people can be fooled into seeing it as ‘original’.\n\nThe authenticity of a replica is important for the impression it gives off to tourists or observers. \n“According to Trilling, the original use of authenticity in tourism was in museums where experts wanted to determine 'whether objects of art are what they appear to be or are claimed to be, and therefore worth the price that is asked for them or…. worth the admiration they are being given'.”\n\nThese reproductions and the values of authenticity presented to the public through artifacts in museums provide “truth”. However, authenticity has a way of also being represented in what the public expects in a predictable manner or based on stereotypes within museums. This idea of authenticity also relates to cultural artifacts like food, cultural activities, festivals, housing, and dress that helps to homogenize the cultures that are being represented and make them seem static.\n\nFor luxury goods, the same authentic feel has to be present for consumers to want to buy a “fake” designer bag or watch that provides them with the same feelings and desired experiences, but as well achieves the look of higher class.\n\nReplicas and reproductions are also for purely consumption and personal value. Through souvenirs people can own their very own physical representation of their experience or passions. \nPeople can buy on-line full size replicas (museum-quality) of the Rosetta Stone or prints and museum-quality copies of the Mona Lisa and other famous pieces of art.\n\nFor example, Difference Engine No. 2, designed by Charles Babbage in the 19th century, was reconstructed from original drawings studied by Allan Bromley in the 1980s and is now on display at the Science Museum in London, England. A second example is Stephenson's Rocket where a replica was built in 1979, following the original design fairly closely, but with some adaptations.\n\nIn China the terra-cotta warriors can be recreated to be personalized for customers. The “Talented craftspeople use their hands and proper tools reproducing every masterwork precisely in the same manner as the royal craftsmen did 2200 years ago. They are made from the same local clay as the originals and constructed essentially in the same ancient method.” These warriors can come in a variety of sizes and provide a very realistic and authentic experience with their own personal warrior.\n\nAs the white mark prestige comes from the imitation of iPhone, the white marks are the most popular brands in the world. Knock-off brand label fashions and accessories like Louis Vuitton, Coach, Chanel, and Rolex are major labels that often are copied.\nReplicas can also be used for re-enactment purposes, for example replicas of steel helmets and leather equipment used in WW2.\n\nControversies with replicas (museum context) are associated with who owns the past.\n\nWith works of art museums assert their intellectual property rights for replicas and reproduction of images which many museums use commercial licensing for providing access to images. Issues are arising with more images being available on the internet and it being free access.\n\nArtists can claim copyright infringement related to displays of their work in a context they did not approve of which can be the creation of replicas of their pieces.\n\nWith replica artifacts the copies to be “museum-quality” have to reach a high standard and can cost a lot of money to be produced.\n\nReplica artifacts (copies) can provide an authentic view but represents more of the subjectivities of what people expect and desire from their museum experiences and the cultures they learn about.\n\nWith copies of retail and other counterfeit goods there is a legal issue related to copyright and trademark ownership. Discourses are being constructed around the reproduction of art and cultural heritage - see the Victoria & Albert Museum's ReACH Initiatives (#reachdialogue) . Dialogues on the 'first original copy' and the role of blockchain technologies in authenticating replicas, and ownership is taking shape .\n\n"}

The Udasis were key interpreters of the Sikh philosophy and the custodians of important Sikh shrines until the Akali movement. They brought many converts into the Sikh fold during the 18th and the early 19th centuries. However, their religious practices border on a syncretism of Sikhism and Hinduism. When the Singh Sabha, dominated by Khalsa Sikhs, redefined the Sikh identity in the early 20th century, the Udasi mahants were expelled from the Sikh shrines. Since then, the Udasis have increasingly regarded themselves as Hindus rather than Sikhs.\n\nThe word \"udasi\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"udas\" (\"detachment\"), and may signify indifference to or renunciation of worldly concerns. Although Guru Nanak emphasized the importance of a social life, his son Sri Chand propagated asceticism and celibacy.\n\nThe Udasis gained prominence during the Sikh rule in northern India: before the advent of the Sikh rule, they had around a dozen centres; by the end of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's reign, the number had increased to around 250. The Udasis played an important role in propagating the Sikh philosophy, and during the 18th and the early 19th centuries, their teachings attracted a large number of people to the Sikh fold.\n\nBefore the emergence of the Singh Sabha Movement in the late 19th century, they controlled the important Sikh shrines, including the Harimandir Sahib. However, during the Akali movement of the 20th century, the Khalsa Sikhs expelled them from the Sikh shrines, accusing them of vices and of indulging in ritual practices that were against the teachings of the Sikh gurus. The Sikh Gurdwara Reform Act, 1925 defined the term \"Sikh\" in a way that excluded the syncretic groups like the Udasis, the Nanakpanthis and Sanatanis. Subsequently, the Udasis increasingly identified themselves as Hindus rather than Sikhs.\n\nThe Udasis do not reject the Sikh Gurus, but attach greater importance to the line of succession from Guru Nanak through Sri Chand to the Udasi mahants. They interpret the message of Guru Granth Sahib in Vedantic terms. They do not abide by the Khalsa's Rehat Maryada.\n\nThe Udasis also worship the panchayatana, the five Hindu deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, Ganesha, and Surya.\n\nTraditionally, there were four Udasi centres (\"akharas\" or \"dhuans\") with each controlling a certain preaching area; Nanakmatta, Kashmir, Malwa (Punjab) and Doaba. There is an Udasi gurudwara (temple) in Amritsar, near the Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple).\n\nToday's Udasi are predominantly located in northwestern India especially around Punjab Haryana, Gujarat and cities like Haridwar and New Delhi, they are divided into three major groups:\n\n\n\n"}

He developed the P-51 Mustang during World War II, the F-100 jet fighter, the X-15 rocket plane, and oversaw the Apollo program.\n\nAtwood was born in Walton, Kentucky, on October 26, 1904, to Reverend Dr. Elmer Bugg Atwood and Mabel Bagby Atwood. His younger brother was the linguist Elmer Bagby Atwood. He studied at Hardin-Simmons University from 1924 to 1926, earned a Bachelor of Arts, and then took postgraduate engineering courses at the University of Texas, to obtain Bachelor of Science degree in 1928.\n\nAtwood worked for Douglas Aircraft Company in Southern California, and joined North American Aviation in 1934. He quickly became a vice-president and in 1938 was appointed deputy general manager of North American Aviation. In 1941, he became First Vice President.\n\nAtwood has been described as \"the chief engineer of chief engineers.\" Atwood designed several successful aircraft for North American.\n\nAmong these aircraft: the P-51 Mustang, fighter plane of the Second World War which achieved particularly impressive results in the Air warfare of World War II, the bomber B-25 Mitchell, used by Jimmy Doolittle and 79 airmen in the famous Doolittle Raid and the T-6 Texan, on which almost all American and British airmen have trained in flying.\n\nAtwood later became president of North American Aviation in 1948 and oversaw the development of some of the most important aircraft produced in the United States.

{"id": "2237484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237484", "title": "Hellenica", "text": "Hellenica\n\nHellenica () simply means writings on Greek (Hellenic) subjects. Several histories of fourth-century Greece, written in the mold of Thucydides or straying from it, have borne the conventional Latin title \"Hellenica\". The surviving \"Hellenica\" is an important work of the Greek writer Xenophon and one of the principal sources for the final seven years of the Peloponnesian War not covered by Thucydides, and the war's aftermath.\n\nMany consider this a very personal work, written by Xenophon in retirement on his Spartan estate, intended primarily for circulation among his friends, for people who knew the main protagonists and events, often because they had participated in them. Xenophon's account starts in 411 BC, the year where Thucydides breaks off, and ends in 362 BC, the year of the Battle of Mantineia. There is virtually no transition between the two works, to the extent that the opening words of \"Hellenica\", μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα, are translated as \"After this\", or sometimes \"Following these events\".\n\nXenophon's Hellenica is a classical historical narrative divided into seven books which describes Greco-Persian history in the years BC 411-362. The first two books narrate the final years of the Peloponnesian War from the exact moment in time at which Thucydides’ history ends. The remaining books three to seven focus primarily on the Spartans military and political machinations as the dominant city state in Greece after the Pelopessenian wars end. The Hellenica to also covers rise of Thebes as a major military power, and the brief period known as the Theban hegemony. When thebes became the top city-state following Spartas defeat at the battle of Leuctra. Scholars believe the first two books were written at a much earlier time period, when Xenophon was still living in Athens; while the later books 3-7 were written after Xenophon was banished from Athens and living in Sparta. The work ends with a summation by Xenophon that his history has ended, but another historian may continue it. However, there is no known direct continuation of the narrative. although several continuations did exist in antiquity, they are now lost. The Hellenica is the only primary source for the period from the end of the Peloponnesian War until the time of Alexander. Xenophon was personally familiar with the leading political figures in Sparta, and witnessed many battles and expiditions found in the Hellenica. This period of time in Hellenistic history is poorly attested between Athens golden age and the rise of Macedon. Besides the Hellenica, this period is only written about by much later classical historians in the works of Diodorus Siculus, the Epitome of Trogus by Justin, and in the biographies of Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos. \n\nThe Hellenica start with what happens next after the historic narrative abruptly ends in Thucydides History of the Pelopenessian War. It is alleged Xenophon was the editor of Thucydides manuscript after his supposed sudden death. This allowed Xenophon to directly continue the narration started by Thucydides and arguably Herodutus. Book one covers the ”Decelian war” period of the Peloponnesian war in the years BCE 411-406. These years of the war saw the rival navies of Sparta and Athens fight campaigns in the Hellespont region. Initially the Athenian navy saw several major sea victories. Book one also narrates restoration of Alcibiade to the athenian military and his return to athens in 407 BCE.\n\nBook 2 narrates the years BC 406-402 and the end of the Peloponnesian War with the surrender of Athens in BCE 404. The Spartan commander Lysander ordered the long walls of Athens torn down, and Athens became formally allied with the Spartan hegemony. The Spartans also installed a new government. Book 2 focuses primarily on the internal politics of Athens following the war. The Sparta instituted oligarch regime, known as the thirty tyrants regime was overthrown and there was a resumption of democracy in Athens. \n\nBook 3 shifts viewpoint from Athenian to Spartan politics, covering the years BC 401-395. Book 3 starts with a brief account of the expedition of the Ten-Thousand against Persian king Artaxerxes II. For further description see Xenophons Anabasis. Book 3 narrates the Spartan expedition led by King Agesilaus in Asia Minor against the Persians. The satraps of Ionia, Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes, are prominent characters with shifting allegiances throughout the Hellenica.\n\nBook 4 narrates BC 395-388, and is primarily concerned with the Corinthian War. Book 4 recalls King Agesilaus’s Ionian campaign against Persian BC 396-395. During this time, Satrap Pharnabazus bribed Greek states into revolting against the Sparta. This eventually led to the Corinthian war, with the states of Athens, Corinth , Argos, and Thebes united against Sparta. This led to the recall of Spartan king Agesilaus and his army in 394 BC from his campaign against Persia. This time saw the beginning of the Corinthian War, with the Persian Empire siding with Athens against Sparta. The Persian satrap Pharnabazus let the exiled Athenian general Conon lead the Persian navy in a number of battles, including the Battle of Cnidus in BC 394. Conon then convinced Pharnabazus to allow Athens to keep the Persian fleet, and to fund rebuilding of the long walls at Athens.\n\nBook 5 covers the years BC 388-374. There is a peace conference at the end of the Corinthian War in BC 387 that results in a treaty called the “Kings Peace”. The acropolis in Thebes is seized by the supposed renegade Spartan Phoebidas, enabling Sparta to control the city until BC 398 when a group of Theban successfully expelled the Spartans and reclaimed mastery of the city. This later led to the Boeotian War from BC 378-372.\n\nBook 6 describes the years BC 374-370. The Athenian general Iphicrates stealthily travels around the Peloponnesus. The Battle of Leuctra results in a major loss for Sparta against Thebes, ending the Boeotian War and Spartan hegemony in Greece, although Sparta would remain influential over the next decade. Theban hegemony begins under the leadership of Theban general Epaminondas.\n\nBook 7 narrates the years BC 370-362. During this period Thebes was the ascendant power in Greece. The old power structures fluctuated as new ones came into being. There was briefly an alliance between Athens and Sparta against Thebes. Sparta faced increasing harassment from both internal rebellions and outside resistance. The Spartan homeland saw the first invasion in centuries. The Theban hegemony ended in BC 362 with the second battle of Mantinea.\n\nAmong competing works under this title, now lost, two stand out, that written by Ephorus of Cyme and that by Theopompus of Chios. Ephorus attempted a universal history, and though he attempted to set apart history from myth, he began his work with the legendary \"Return of the sons of Heracles\", which modern readers understand as wholly mythic \"aitia\". As a pupil of the rhetorician Isocrates he was not above embroidering his narrative with believable circumstantial detail. Oswyn Murray remarked \"His style and completeness unfortunately made him rather popular, but at least he stands out as one who had thought about the purposes that history should serve, and got them wrong.\" The \"Hellenica\" of Theopompus, another pupil of Isocrates, was a continuation of Thucydides.\n\nYet another, fragmentary \"Hellenica\" found in papyrus at Oxyrhynchus, is known as \"Hellenica Oxyrhynchia;\" it covered events from 411 to the year of the Battle of Cnidus, 395/4 BCE. It has been tentatively attributed to several historians.\n\n\n"}

He did not make the field.\n\nHines broke into NASCAR career in 2003, when he and NASCAR Craftsman Truck owner Jimb came to an agreement with Hines to run 5 truck races for him in the later portions of 2003.\n\nHis career started at Indianapolis Raceway Park (IRP). Hines qualified 30th in the No. 27 Dodge Motorsports Dodge Ram and had just made it into the top-10 when he wrecked and crashed into the wall, finishing 32nd. At the next race at Texas Motor Speedway, he qualified 4th, and ran in the top-15 all day, coming home with an eleventh-place finish. Hines ran his last two races that season at Martinsville Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway. At both races, Hines qualified the No. 7 in 22nd place, and finished 13th.\n\nIn 2004, Tommy Baldwin signed Hines to drive three races for the Hungry Drivers program, a Busch Series competition to see who would drive his No. 6 Ragú Dodge Intrepid that season. In his debut at Texas, he started 14th and finished 20th despite a late spin. After a 25th at Talladega Superspeedway, Hines had his best finish of the year, a 17th at Michigan International Speedway.\n\nHines continued to run in the Truck Series, replacing Matt Crafton in the No. 88 Menards Chevrolet Silverado for ThorSport Racing, competing for NASCAR Rookie of the Year.

Despite a lack of sponsorship, ThorSport fielded a second truck for Hines, the No. 13. In 23 races he finished in the top-20 only 7 times. He was released with two races to go in the season after two wildly disappointing years in good equipment. \n\nHines drove one race in 2005 the No. 43 Channellock Dodge for The Curb Agajanian Performance Group at California, where he started 26th and finishing 36th after a late crash. After Wolfe was released from the No. 6, Evernham Motorsports, who now owned the car, hired Hines to drive at The Milwaukee Mile, where he started ninth and finished nineteenth. He also ran at IRP in the No. 6, starting fifth and finishing 24th. Later in the season at Texas, he attempted a Busch race for Glynn Motorsports, however the No. 92 Ultra Comp Trailers Dodge crashed in practice and withdrew.\n\nTracy Hines was to have signed to drive the No. 92 Glynn Motorsports Dodge in the Busch series, but the team dissolved. Instead, he signed to drive the No. 14 Dodge Charger for FitzBradshaw Racing, with sponsorship from TakeMeOn Vacation, Bluegrass, and JaniKing. Hines was teamed with fellow hoosier Joel Kauffman. After an aborted attempt at Rookie of the Year, Hines resigned from Fitz Bradshaw Racing. Hines plans to spend the rest of this season racing sprint cars.\n\nHines raced USAC sprint, midget, and Silver Crown cars for Tony Stewart Racing.

{"id": "2237526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237526", "title": "P400-class patrol vessel", "text": "P400-class patrol vessel\n\nThe P400 patrol ships are small vessels of the French Navy. They were designed to accomplish police operations in the French Exclusive Economic Zone. They were built by the \"Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie\", which specialise in small military craft. Two similar ships are in service in Gabon. The P400 were originally designed in two versions: one armed with Exocet MM38 missiles, and another public service version with a smaller 16-man complement; eventually neither of these versions was commissioned as the Navy chose an intermediate version.\n\nAll of these craft were based in overseas territories (DOM/TOM) where they conducted sea monitoring missions and secured the EEZ. They also executed missions in the context of French agreements with other nations, typically supporting foreign armies or carrying out humanitarian missions. Since late 2008, ships of the \"D'Estienne d'Orves\" class, with their heavy armament removed, are planned to replace the P400 in the high sea patrol role, a task for which the P400 have proved to be underweight.\n\nThe P400 are fitted with a hydraulic crane capable of lifting 2.5 tonnes. This allows to use them for anti-pollution operations, by embarking and debarking equipment and anti-pollution chemicals, and to lift out small craft whilst at sea. An unusual feature for ships of this size, the Operational Centre allows a complete monitoring of close surface situations, using radar indicators and tracking tables. The engine can now be monitored remotely, which allows for a smaller crew. The maintenance of the ship was simplified notably by choosing those solutions which allow to clean the ship whilst in populated areas. The P400 can stay 15 days at sea, and have 20 days of food supplies for 28 adults.\n\nThe engines of the P400 have been a constant source of technical problems since the maiden journey of the lead ship \"L'Audacieuse\" to Dakar.\n\nThe first problem that occurred related to the carter reductor, then with the transmission, and eventually with a piston - this last item being the most worrying, since it was probably a symptom of a conception problem. This shed a bad light on Alstom who were trying to compete against German motors by MTU. French humourist Coluche came up with the witty remark \"Après l'Audacieuse, la Boudeuse, la Capricieuse,… voici venu le temps de la Dépanneuse !\" (After the \"Audacieuse\", the \"Boudeuse\", the \"Capricieuse\", time has come for the \"Tow-Truck\"!).\n\nAfter these problems were solved, larger exhaust pipes had to be fixed (originally, exhaust was vented underwater to minimise infra-red signature, but it turned out that the ship was taking water from these openings).\n\nAfter further studies, it became possible to gain the space of one propulsion compartment, which is now used for cargo and personnel. The ships can ferry 20 people, and up to 60 for short travel with a calm sea.\n\nIn May 2009, \"La Fougueuse\" arrived in Brest to be decommissioned, the first of the P400 to be taken out of service.\n\nIn February 2011, it was decided that eight P400 will be equipped with new engines. Previously, these ships were scheduled to retire according to Jane's Navy International. They will repair to ensure renewal of their operation until 2020. Earlier, the French Navy had intended to retire these ships in the period from 2010 to 2014. The reason for extending the service life of ships of this class is the desire to reduce the cost of procurement of new weapons.\n\nCurrently the ships are equipped with two Wartsila SACM UD30 V16 M3 diesel engines. The new engines will be delivered to France's Mother Boda and installed by \"Piriu Naval Service\" (PNS - Piriou Naval Services) in a 10-year contract worth €30 million (US$39 million). The first of the modernised ships should be returned to the French Navy by March 2011. PNS also undertakes restoration of these ships.\n\nOne of the decommissioned vessels, \"La Tapageuse\", was offered to the Philippine Coast Guard, and is estimated to cost about €6 million including the refurbishing works. The deal did not push through, and French shipbuilder Piriou took control of the ship, which was later sold to Gabon as part of a larger deal.\n\nThe French Navy is currently looking into a future class of patrol vessels to replace the P400s as they retire. The working name for this future class is BATSIMAR (\"Bâtiments de surveillance et d'intervention maritime\", or 'surveillance and maritime intervention ships' in English).\n\n"}

{"id": "2237587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237587", "title": "Italic peoples", "text": "Italic peoples\n\nThe Italic peoples were an Indo-European ethnolinguistic group identified by their use of Italic languages.\n\nThe Italic peoples descended from Indo-Europeans who migrated into Italy in the second millennium BC. Latins achieved a dominant position among these tribes, establishing ancient Roman civilization. During this development, other Italic tribes adopted Latin language and culture in a process known as Romanization. This process was eventually extended to much of Europe. The ethnic groups which emerged as a result are known as Romance peoples. \n\nThe Italics were an ethnolinguistic group who are identified by their use of the Italic languages, which form one of the branches of Indo-European languages. \n\nOutside of the specialised linguistic literature, the term is also used to describe all of the ancient peoples of Italy including pre-Roman peoples like the Etruscans and the Raetians, who did not speak Indo-European languages. Such use is improper in linguistics, but common in ancient and modern historiography.\n\nDuring the Copper Age, at the same time that metalworking appeared, Indo-European people are believed to have migrated to Italy in several waves. Associated with this migration are the Rinaldone culture and Remedello culture in Northern Italy, and the Gaudo culture of Southern Italy. These cultures were led by a warrior-aristocracy and are considered intrusive. Their Indo-European character is suggested by the presence of weapons in burials, the appearance of the horse in Italy at this time and material similarities with cultures of Central Europe. \n\nAccording to David W. Anthony, between 3100–3000 BCE, a massive migration of Indo-Europeans from the Yamnaya culture took place into the Danube Valley. Thousands of kurgans are attributed to this event. These migrations probably split off Pre-Italic, Pre-Celtic and Pre-Germanic from Proto-Indo-European. By this time the Anatolian peoples and the Tocharians had already split off from other Indo-Europeans. Hydronymy shows that the Proto-Germanic homeland was in Central Germany, which would be very close to the homeland of Italic and Celtic languages as well. The origin of a hypothetical ancestral \"Italo-Celtic\" people is to be found in today's eastern Hungary, settled around 3100 BCE by the Yamnaya culture. This hypothesis is to some extent supported by the observation that Italic shares a large number of isoglosses and lexical terms with Celtic and Germanic, some of which are more likely to be attributed to the Bronze Age. In particular, using Bayesian phylogenetic methods, Russell Gray and Quentin Atkinson argued that Proto-Italic speakers separated from Proto-Germanics 5500 years before present, i.e. roughly at the start of the Bronze Age. This is further confirmed by the fact that the Germanic language family shares more vocabulary with the Italic family than with the Celtic language family.\n\nFrom the late third to the early second millennium BCE, tribes coming both from the north and from Franco-Iberia brought the Beaker culture and the use of bronze smithing, to the Po Valley, to Tuscany and to the coasts of Sardinia and Sicily. The Beakers could have been the link which brought the Yamnaya dialects from Hungary to Austria and Bavaria. These dialects might then have developed into Proto-Celtic. The arrival of Indo-Europeans into Italy is in some sources ascribed to the Beakers. A migration across the Alps from East-Central Europe by Italic tribes is thought to have occurred around 1800 BCE.\n\nIn the mid-second millennium BCE, the Terramare culture developed in the Po Valley. The Terramare culture takes its name from the black earth (\"terra marna\") residue of settlement mounds, which have long served the fertilizing needs of local farmers. These people were still hunters, but had domesticated animals; they were fairly skillful metallurgists, casting bronze in moulds of stone and clay, and they were also agriculturists, cultivating beans, the vine, wheat and flax. The Latino-Faliscan people have been associated with this culture, especially by the archaeologist Luigi Pigorini.\n\nThe Urnfield culture might have brought proto-Italic people from among the \"Italo-Celtic\" tribes who remained in Hungary into Italy. These tribes are thought to have penetrated Italy from the east during the late second millennium BC through the Proto-Villanovan culture. They later crossed the Apennine Mountains and settled central Italy, including Latium. Before 1000 BCE several Italic tribes had probably entered Italy. These divided into various groups and gradually came to occupy central Italy and southern Italy. This period was characterized by widespread upheaval in the Mediterranean, including the emergence of the Sea Peoples and the Late Bronze Age collapse.\n\nThe Proto-Villanovan culture dominated the peninsula and replaced the preceding Apennine culture. The Proto-Villanovans practiced cremation and buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of a distinctive double-cone shape. Generally speaking, Proto-Villanovan settlements have been found in almost the whole Italian peninsula from Veneto to eastern Sicily, although they were most numerous in the northern-central part of Italy. The most important settlements excavated are those of Frattesina in Veneto region, Bismantova in Emilia-Romagna and near the Monti della Tolfa, north of Rome. The Latino-Faliscans, the Veneti, and possibly the Osco-Umbrians too, have been associated with this culture.\n\nIn the 13th century BCE, Proto-Celts (probably the ancestors of the Lepontii people), coming from the area of modern-day Switzerland, eastern France and south-western Germany (\"RSFO\" Urnfield group), entered Northern Italy (Lombardy and eastern Piedmont), starting the Canegrate culture, who not long time after, merging with the indigenous Ligurians, produced the mixed Golasecca culture.\n\nIn the early Iron Age, the relatively homogeneous Proto-Villanovan culture (1200-900 BCE), closely associated with the Celtic Halstatt culture of Alpine Austria, characterised by the introduction of iron-working and the practice of cremation coupled with the burial of ashes in distinctive pottery, shows a process of fragmentation and regionalisation. In Tuscany and in part of Emilia-Romagna, Latium and Campania, the Proto-Villanovan culture was followed by the Villanovan culture. The earliest remains of Villanovan culture date back to circa 900 BCE.\n\nIn the region south of the Tiber (\"Latium Vetus\"), the Latial culture of the Latins emerged, while in the north-east of the peninsula the Este culture of the Veneti appeared. Roughly in the same period, from their core area in central Italy (modern-day Umbria and Sabina region), the Osco-Umbrians began to emigrate in various waves, through the process of Ver sacrum, the ritualized extension of colonies, in southern Latium, Molise and the whole southern half of the peninsula, replacing the previous tribes, such as the Opici and the Oenotrians. This corresponds with the emergence of the Terni culture, which had strong similarities with the Celtic cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. The Umbrian necropolis of Terni, which dates back to the 10th century BCE, was identical in every aspect to the Celtic necropolis of the Golasecca culture.\n\nBy the mid-first millennium BCE, the Latins of Rome were growing in power and influence. This led to the establishment of ancient Roman civilization. In order to combat the non-Italic Etruscans, several Italic tribes united in the Latin League. After the Latins had liberated themselves from Etruscan rule they acquired a dominant position among the Italic tribes. Frequent conflict between various Italic tribes followed. The best documented of these are the wars between the Latins and the Samnites. \n\nThe Latins eventually succeeded in unifying the Italic elements in the country. Many non-Latin Italic tribes adopted Latin culture and acquired Roman citizenship. During this time Italic colonies were established throughout the country, and non-Italic elements eventually adopted the Latin language and culture in a process known as Romanization. In the early first century BCE, several Italic tribes, in particular the Marsi and the Samnites, rebelled against Roman rule. This conflict is called the Social War. After Roman victory was secured, all peoples in Italy, except for the Celts of the Po Valley, were granted Roman citizenship.\n\nIn the subsequent centuries, Italic tribes adopted Latin language and culture in a process known as Romanization. This process was eventually extended to much of Europe. The ethnic groups which emerged as a result are known as Romance peoples.\n\n\n\n"}

He returned to Venezuela in 1939 and was promptly commissioned in the Venezuelan army by president General Eleazar Lopez Contreras with the rank of captain.\n\nAs one of the brightest officials of the Armed Forces associated with the group that overthrew Isaías Medina Angarita in 1945, Carlos was a member of the Government Revolutionary Junta that replaced Medina. He was Minister of Defence during the presidencies of Rómulo Betancourt and Rómulo Gallegos.\n\nIn 1948, Chalbaud was among those who overthrew that government of president Gallegos, and was a member of the Military Junta of Government along with Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Luis Llovera Páez, who was the titular head of the three-person junta.\n\nHe was kidnapped and assassinated on 13 November 1950, by a group led by Rafael Simon Urbina and his nephew Domingo Urbina. The kidnapping took place in Caracas between the neighbourhood of Country Club and Chapellin, and his murder took place in the semi-abandoned Las Mercedes neighbourhood. His murder seems to be the unintended outcome of a failed kidnapping led by Simon Urbina, who looked to overthrow the Chalbaud presidency. Some believe Urbina despised Delgado Chalbaud although others allege they were close until a falling out over politics. The day after the capture and imprisonment of Urbina, he was assassinated by orders of the Direction of National Security, efficiently securing Pérez Jiménez's position as the strongman in Venezuela for the next several years.\n\nChalbaud was married to Lucía Devine, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1948–1950. Cerro Carlos Delgado Chalbaud (1047m), a mountain in Venezuela's Amazonas estate where the headwaters of the Orinoco River are located, is named after him.\n\n\n"}

He was president of the Government Junta from 1950 to 1952, after the assassination of Carlos Delgado Chalbaud.\n\nHis parents were J.M. Suárez and Clorinda Flamerich. He graduated from the Liceo Caracas high school and then from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. As a college student, he participated in the protests against the dictatorship of Gómez of the \"Semana del Estudiante\" in February 1928.

He was elected to one five-year term in 1978. He was a member of COPEI, a Christian Democratic party.\n\nLuis Antonio Herrera Campins was born in Acarigua, Portuguesa. He studied law initially at Central University of Venezuela, though his studies were interrupted when he was imprisoned during the regime of Marcos Pérez Jiménez. He eventually earned his law degree in 1955 from the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela.\n\nHerrera entered politics in 1937, and from 1959 to 1979 he served in the National Congress. He became President of Venezuela on 12 March 1979.\n\nHerrera won the December 1978 presidential elections for COPEI, replacing the social democrat Carlos Andrés Pérez of the Democratic Action (AD) party, who had nationalised the oil industry at the height of the boom in 1975. Oil revenues continued to rise during the early years of Herrera's presidency. Herrera had a dirigiste view of the Government's economic role, which involved channelling public funds into agricultural and industrial projects, paying generous subsidies and controlling the prices of many goods. His Government continued President Pérez's policy of borrowing on a world market awash with petrodollars, and by the early 1980s Venezuela owed the banks more than $20 billion. The Government's tacit assumption was that oil prices would remain high forever, and would sustain high levels of public and private consumption.\n\nAs president, Herrera implemented cultural development programs and education reforms. He liberalised prices, resulting in rapid changes in the value of the Venezuelan bolívar.\n\nMoved in part by territorial claims, Herrera developed a muscular foreign policy. He signed an agreement with Mexico in 1980 to jointly provide Central American and Caribbean countries with a steady flow of oil, a precursor of Hugo Chávez's wide-reaching oil diplomacy in the developing world. In 1982 Herrera sided with Argentina in its war with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands or Islas Malvinas, adroitly exploiting anti-British and anti-American sentiment to boost his flagging popularity. His support for Argentina came while he was asserting Venezuela's longstanding claim to more than half of neighboring Guyana, a former British colony. His government also recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as the sovereign state in Western Sahara. In December 1982, PDVSA signed a cooperation agreement with the german oil company VEBA for the establishment of a Joint Venture Ruhr Oel GmbH. This fact are considered the beginning of the Internationalization of PDVSA.\n\nBy the time Herrera's term ended, the economy was in meltdown, poverty and hardship were widespread and the voters turned on the ruling Christian Democrat, ejecting the party from office in the elections of December 1983. After the end of his presidency, Herrera remained influential in the Copei party, becoming its president in 1995.\n\nIn 2001, Herrera made headlines when gunmen stole his car. Afterward, he could be seen on foot wearing old clothes and carrying his own groceries. He underwent a series of surgeries for an abdominal aneurysm that led to a kidney infection and other complications. Herrera died on 9 November 2007 in Caracas at the age of 82, at a juncture by which he had already retired from Venezuelan politics. He was survived by his wife Betty Urdaneta and three sons.\n\n\n"}

It was only released in the United Kingdom and British Commonwealth Countries. \n\nIn 1997, an article by \"World Magazine\" accused the NIVI of being \"a feminist seduction of the evangelical church\". This led to a protest in evangelical circles, led by James Dobson. Despite some evangelicals coming to the defense of the NIVI, Zondervan responded by not releasing the NIVI in the United States.\n\nThe front cover of the Inclusive Language edition did not distinguish the version from the standard NIV, and only in opening the Bible on the title page was it clear it was a feminist/Inclusive Language version.\n\nOne of the criticisms was that the word ‘man’ was replaced by a variety of words in a very mechanical way (‘anyone’ ‘person’ etc.) even in passages where clearly a man was indicated.\nThis lent credibility to the criticism that this was a feminist translation with the need to strip the translation of as many occurrences as possible of the word ‘man’.

She was married in 1713 to Richard Aldworth, Esq., in Newmarket. During the duration of the Hon. Elizabeth Aldworth—‘Whenever a benefit was given at the theaters in Dublin or Cork for the Masonic Female Orphan Asylum, she walked at the head of the Freemasons with her apron and other insignia of Freemasonary, and sat in the front row of the stage box. The house was always crowded on these occasions. Her portrait is in the lodge-room of almost every lodge of Ireland.’ \n\nThe date of her initiation into Freemasonry is uncertain, but the \"Memoir of a Lady Freemason\" indicates that it was between 1710–1712, before her marriage. In his paper in \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum\" in 1895, Edward Conder states that it was sometime between 1710–1718. In a reply to the paper, Masonic scholar William James Hughan stated: \"Until Bro. Conder’s investigations we had all assumed that the various reports respecting the initiation of the Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger, though not always in agreement, were correct as to the occurrence being of a later date than 1730.\" Hughan also found the facts related to contradict the statements made by an Aldworth descendant.\n\nThose facts are found in the \"Memoir\", extracted from the records of the First Lodge of Ireland, which state that Arundel Hill was present at the initiation and often sat in Lodge with her. The \"Memoir\"'s editor also indicates that Conder's work was the first fixing of the date, which as of 1864 was not known.\n\nConder also states that the particular Lodge in which she was initiated, while commonly thought at the time of his research to be known, is also unknown, but that it may have been a private Lodge warranted out of London by her father. Conder also seems to be refuting an unelaborated-upon statement that Aldworth was initiated after the formation of the Grand Lodge of Ireland. He indicates that since the Viscount died in 1727, she could not have been initiated after that point, and at that time it seems that the commonly accepted date of formation of the Grand Lodge was 1729–30. It is now taken to be 1725.\n\nThe tradition of Aldworth's initiation is that Aldworth had fallen asleep while reading on a dim winter evening in the library, which was located next to the room in which the Lodge was meeting. In consequence of construction going on in the library, she was woken by the voices she heard next door, and the light shining through the loose brickwork. She removed some of the bricks and watched the proceedings. When she understood the solemnity of the proceedings, she wished to retreat, but was caught by the Lodge Tyler, who was also the family butler. Realizing her predicament, she screamed and fainted. The tyler summoned the Brethren (among them her father), and they ultimately decided to initiate her into the Lodge.\n\nIn the reply to Conder's presentation, a Bro. Rylands indicated that \"there was no evidence forthcoming\" that Aldworth served as Master of a Lodge, or that she regularly attended.\nElizabeth Aldworth died in 1775. There was a plaque erected at the new St. Finbarre's Cathedral by the Masons of Cork, which reads:\nIn Pious Memory of\nThe Honourable\nELIZABETH ALDWORTH,\nWife of\nRICHARD ALDWORTH,\nOf Newmarket Court, Co. Cork, Esq.,\nDaughter of\nARTHUR, FIRST VISCOUNT DONERAILE.\nHer Remains Lie Close to This Spot.\nBorn 1695, Died 1775.\nInitiated into Masonry in\nLodge No. 44, at Doneraile Court\nIn this County, A.D. 1712. \n"}

It was published by DC Comics, with a sporadic schedule, between 2005 and 2008. The series was to be rebooted under the title \"Dark Knight: Boy Wonder\" in 2011, when both Miller and Lee were to finish the last six issues. The series retells the origin story of Dick Grayson, who became Batman's sidekick Robin.\n\nThis was the first series to be launched in 2005 under DC's \"All Star\" imprint. These series are helmed by renowned writers and artists in the American comic book industry and attempt to retell some of the history of prominent DC Universe characters, but outside of DC Universe continuity, and not be restricted by it, in order to appeal to new and returning readers. Each title under the \"All Star\" imprint is set in its own continuity and separate universe. According to Miller, the series takes place in the same continuity as Miller's other Batman-related works, such as \"The Dark Knight Returns\".\n\nBruce Wayne and Vicki Vale are at the circus watching The Flying Graysons, an acrobat family consisting of twelve-year-old Dick Grayson and his parents. When Dick's parents are shot to death by a hit man, he is escorted from the scene by several cops of the Gotham City Police Department in a threatening manner. Batman swiftly subdues the killer, Jocko-Boy Vanzetti and then rescues Dick from the police, damaging both a police cruiser and the car which Vicki and Alfred Pennyworth are in, injuring Vicki in the process. The stern Batman tells Dick that he has been \"drafted into a war\", and that he will learn much about fighting crime. Batman brings Dick to the Batcave and leaves him there to his own devices, telling him upon leaving that when hungry, Dick may eat the rats and bats in the cave.\n\nAfter being informed that Vicki has been hospitalized in critical condition, Batman instructs Alfred to contact Clark Kent at the Daily Planet, to request he immediately transport a Parisian doctor that Batman knows as a personal favor. After Alfred provides Dick with food and clothes, Batman and Alfred get into a heated argument, but Batman backs off when Alfred asserts himself.\n\nThe Justice League, consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man and Green Lantern, disagree on how to deal with Batman's actions. Wonder Woman wishes to kill him, but agrees to wait until after Green Lantern has had a chance to speak with Batman.\n\nA disturbed Batman spends the subsequent evenings violently dispatching attempted rapists and other criminals until he spots a police cruiser escorting Jocko-Boy Vanzetti away from jail, and returning to Vanzetti the gun he used to murder the Graysons. Batman dispatches the corrupt policeman and beats Vanzetti into unconsciousness.\n\nBatman subsequently comes to the aid of Black Canary, who is fighting a group of thugs. After defeating the criminals, the two masked crimefighters share a romantic interlude, before Batman takes Canary home, with Vanzetti bound and gagged in the Batmobile's trunk. Batman and Dick manage to force from Jocko-Boy the name of the person who hired him: the Joker. Dick wants to fight crime with Batman, but Batman says he needs a secret identity.\n\nAfter Batman leaves the cave to dump Jocko-Boy in the river, then he encounters Green Lantern, and addresses him by his surname, Jordan, bewildering Lantern as to how he knew his true identity. Batman gives Jordan an address to meet him at in twelve hours. Meanwhile, Joker goes to see Catwoman, and invites her to join him in \"some mischief\".\n\nDick creates a costume that includes a hood, basing it on Robin Hood, but Batman points out that an opponent can easily pull the hood down over his head. Batman tells him to lose the hood and names him Robin. Dick receives a new costume made by Alfred.\n\nBatman and Robin adorn themselves in yellow body paint and costumes, and meet Green Lantern in a room painted entirely in yellow, since Green Lantern's power ring has no effect on anything yellow in color. Lantern tries to persuade Batman that his methods are not acceptable, either to the superhero community or the world at large, but Batman \ndismisses his concerns, and denies Lantern's claim that Robin is Dick Grayson. Robin then steals Green Lantern's power ring, leading to a fight in which Lantern is nearly killed. Batman then takes Robin to his parents' graves, where they share a moment of mutual grief.\n\nA police officer discovers a beaten and badly bleeding Catwoman. Before vanishing, she passes him a message, that Captain Jim Gordon later passes to Batman. He and Robin find her underground.\n\nJim Gordon learns his wife has been in an accident, due to her alcoholism. At the same time his daughter, dressed as Batgirl, is fighting crime. Black Canary robs a group of snuff film makers and proceeds to set them on fire. Batgirl is later arrested, and Jim is shown to be deeply depressed when he calls his former lover Sarah at the suggestion of his daughter.\n\nThe first issue launched with four different covers. Three of them were illustrated by Jim Lee—one sporting Batman, the other Robin and one a sketch variant of Batman. Frank Miller illustrated the fourth. Since then, Frank Miller has drawn variant covers for the series. With the exception of issue #2, the Miller covers are sold in 1:10 ratios. For issue #8 and #9, the variant covers were drawn by Neal Adams. The cover for #10 was drawn by Frank Quitely.\n\nThe \"All Star\" titles are self-contained story arcs existing outside of official DC Comics continuity. Despite sharing a label with Grant Morrison's \"All-Star Superman\", \"All Star Batman & Robin\" exists in its own continuity unrelated to other books in the All Star imprint.\n\nFrank Miller has also stated that \"All Star Batman & Robin\" does exist in the same continuity as the other storylines in his Dark Knight Universe. This consists of Miller's \"\", its sequel \"\", \"\" and the Frank Miller/Todd McFarlane collaboration on \"Spawn/Batman\". Of these, only \"Year One\" is considered canonical to the mainstream DC Universe. However, this has been proven difficult as \"The Dark Knight Returns\" is set during the Cold War with an older Batman while \"All Star Batman & Robin\" features a younger Batman in a more modern setting, specifically 2008. An additional story, titled \"Holy Terror, Batman!\", was also to be included within the same continuity. However, in 2010, Miller stated that he was no longer working on the project. He later clarified his statement by explaining that it would feature a new character called The Fixer rather than Batman, and not be published by DC. In 2007, Frank Miller's \"Dark Knight Universe\" was officially designated as Earth-31 within the new DC Comics Multiverse composed of 52 alternate universes.\n\nMorrison has stated that he was uncertain whether his Superman and the version featured in \"All Star Batman & Robin\" are the same due to the dramatic time differences between the two books: \"I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman at the beginning of his career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond \"All Star Batman\". But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up.\"\n\nThe series' first issue sold over 300,000 copies. The once-monthly series became increasingly delayed over time, to the point where only one issue was published in 2006. When issue #5 was released, the series was placed on a regular bi-monthly schedule, with the exception of Issue #10, which was postponed from April 9, 2008 release to August 27 release, and then to a September 10 release, which it successfully met, only for the book to be recalled due to a printing error that left numerous profanities insufficiently censored. That printing error aside, Jim Lee took full responsibilities for the series' delays, explaining that he was involved with the \"DC Universe Online\" video game, and that Miller's scripts had been written some time earlier.\n\nDespite drops in sales since the first issue, \"All Star Batman & Robin\" issues regularly topped DC Comics' highest-selling chart on the months when they came out.\n\nInitially released with great fanfare and much anticipation, \"All Star Batman\" has consistently received negative reviews from critics. Nearly all complaints about the series are directed at Frank Miller's writing, specifically his non-traditional interpretation of the main character. In the series to date, Batman is consistently displayed as violent, cruel and almost childish at times, excited by his own sadism towards criminals, musing over the injuries he inflicts and disarray that follows. Infamous examples of this include his verbal and physical abuse of Dick Grayson in an attempt to prevent him from grieving over his parents' deaths, and the action of throwing a Molotov cocktail during a fight.\nIn issue #2 Miller's gritty style of dialogue led the title character to introduce himself to Grayson as \"the Goddamn Batman\". The phrase was repeated at least once in nearly every subsequent issue of the comic. According to reviewer Brett Weiss, the line \"drew derision from fans and critics alike\". \n\nReviewer Peter Sanderson of IGN Comics, while acknowledging that the series is \"widely reviled\", and opining that DC Comics' publicity for the series was \"misleading\", suggested that Batman's treatment of Grayson was comparable to a drill sergeant's treatment of a new recruit, but questioned whether this would merely traumatize Grayson further. He nonetheless claimed to be \"fascinated\" with how this behavior reveals Batman's personality, likening his rough treatment of Grayson to the psychologically frightening experience to which V subjected Evey Hammond in \"V for Vendetta\". Sanderson also pointed out that Miller's view of \"All Star Batman & Robin\" as prequels to his graphic novels \"\" and \"\" suggests that the darker, grittier take on Batman and his more dysfunctional relationship with Robin make sense when taken in context, and that Batman's rough treatment of Dick Grayson reveals a lot about the inner workings of Batman's personality. Reviewer Brett Weiss, in the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" #1636 (December 2007), gave the first issue of the series high marks for being interesting and edgy, but opined that by issue #6, the series became \"a bad joke\", citing the series' \"absurdly bad, \"faux-noir\" dialogue\", and presenting Batman \"as a psychopath, as opposed to merely dark and disturbed.\" Weiss praised Jim Lee's art as \"gorgeous\", but opined that it was wasted on the title, which he saw as \"something that seems to be bad on purpose\". The series is also known for the recalled issue #10, in which a printing error allowed the word \"fuck\" to be published uncensored. Unreturned copies were later sold on eBay at inflated prices.\n\nComics journalist Cliff Biggers, in \"Comic Shop News\" #1064 (November 7, 2007), called the series \"one of the biggest train wrecks in comics history\", expressing amazement at how he feels Frank Miller disregarded every aspect of Batman's character in order to tell \"a \"Sin City\" story in bat-garb.\" Reviewing issue #7, Biggers excoriated the sequence with Batman and Black Canary as \"farcical\" and \"Tarantinoesque\", arguing that Miller's work could not get worse. Biggers gave the issue a \"D\", explaining that it would be an \"F\" if not for Jim Lee's art, and suggested that to salvage the work, DC should reprint the book with blank word balloons and let readers submit their own scripts. Reviewing the first three issues of the series, William Gatevackes of PopMatters said that \"[Jim Lee's art] is beautiful [but] cannot make up for the writing or the holes in the storytelling.\" Gatevackes criticized what he perceived to be a lack of plot, saying that \"it seems like [Miller is] expanding four issues of story over 20 issues of the book.\" Gatevackes compared \"All Star Batman & Robin\" unfavorably to Miller's previous work, saying: \"One is puzzled as to what happened to the Frank Miller who gained his fame on \"Daredevil\", \"Ronin\", and \"\". Can he come back? Because until he does, \"All Star Batman and Robin\" should be avoided at all costs.\"\n\nIann Robinson, writing for CraveOnline, wrote an essay critical of \"All Star Batman & Robin\", calling it \"a comic series that just spirals deeper and deeper into the abyss of unreadable. I understand Miller's need to re-invent, but this is just badly done and in poor taste.\" Robinson commented that \"the art by Jim Lee is first rate [and] really wonderful to look at, [but] Frank Miller has stripped Batman of all of his dignity, class, and honor. This isn't the Dark Knight; this is Dirty Harry in a cowl. The worst part is that this is \"exactly\" what Batman isn't about.\" He added, \"In one fell swoop, Miller has erased all the good he did for Batman with \"\" and \"\". All of that is just gone.\"\n\nThe book also has its defenders. Jon Morris, writing for \"The High Hat\", named \"All Star Batman & Robin\" one of the best superhero comics of 2006, finding \"All Star\"'s take on the character \"an intriguing alternative take on a character long reimagined to the point of incoherence. Surely the readers as a whole have seen Batman the tortured soul, Batman the awkward father figure, Batman the authoritarian and Batman the zillion-other-paternal character archetypes countless times before under the stewardship of a few dozen other authors; why not for a scant twelve issues have a book about a Batman who might just be what a control-obsessed, Kevlar-suited sadist would be like in real life — which is to say \"distinctly unpleasant\"? It’s unsavory, sure, but who buys Batman comics because he’s warm and cuddly?\"\n\nAfter the series encountered a hiatus of nearly two years, DC Comics announced on April 2, 2010 that Miller and Lee would return to the series in 2011. Instead of falling under the \"All Star\" print, the series was to be re-branded as \"Dark Knight: Boy Wonder\", and would run for six issues, completing the story Miller originally intended to tell. However, this series was never published.\n\nThe series has been collected into the following volume:\n\n"}

The school was established on the site of a placer gold mine, next to Southern Technical Institute (later Southern Polytechnic State University and now Kennesaw State University - Marietta Campus). 22 students attended the first classes in January 1975. \nIn 1989 the name of the school was shortened to Life College, as the school recently had opened an undergraduate program and was no longer purely chiropractic. This undergraduate program allowed Life to establish an intercollegiate athletic program. By 1990, the school had grown to become the largest college of chiropractic in the world. In March 2004, Dr. Guy Riekeman, former Chancellor of the Palmer Chiropractic University System, was appointed as the President of Life University. In 2017 Dr. Rob Scott took over as President of the university and Dr. Riekeman became Chancellor.\n\nLife University is divided into two colleges: the College of Chiropractic (D.C. Doctor of Chiropractic) and the College of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies (A.S. Computer Information Management, Coaching Psychology, and Health and Wellness; B.B.A. Business Administration; B.A. Positive Human Development and Social Change; B.S. Biology, Biopsychology, Psychology, Computer Information Management, Culinary Nutrition, Dietetics, Exercise Science, General Studies, Health Coaching and Nutrition; M.S. Sport Health Science, Clinical Nutrition and Positive Psychology; and M.A.T. Athletic Training).\n\nLife University offers a curriculum for pre-chiropractic that is not a degree program but may lead to an undergraduate degree, in preparation to enter the College of Chiropractic.\n\nLife University's M.S. in Positive Psychology is one of just three similar programs in the entire United States.\n\nThe university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS-COC) to award Associates, Bachelors, Masters and Doctor of Chiropractic degrees.\n\nThe Doctor of Chiropractic degree program of Life University College of Chiropractic is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE).\n\nThe chiropractic program is currently on probation by the Council on Chiropractic Education for failing to pass at least 70% of students through the chiropractic program in less than five full academic years. Being on probation means that the program is \"in significant noncompliance with accreditation standards or policy requirements\".\n\nThe Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) and Dietetic Internship (DI) Program are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE) of the American Dietetic Association (ADA).\n\nThe campus is located in Marietta, Georgia on 110 wooded acres. The campus features five miles of walking and jogging trails, an outdoor amphitheater, outdoor seating and study areas, and reflection pools. LEED-certified green housing includes the Village Retreat, apartment-style living on campus. LIFE has restored a 19th-century village and gristmill, located on campus along Rottenwood Creek.\n\nThe Ian Grassam Treehouse is set amongst the trees and the lake, and serves as a student retreat.\n\nThe main dining area on campus is Socrates Café which opened in January 2010. The facility and outside patio focuses on sustainability initiatives, capable of zero waste through recycling, biodegrading and composting serving locally and serving organically grown food when possible.\n\nLife University has more than 60,000 patient visits at its on-campus outpatient clinic each year. The outpatient clinic provides chiropractic care and wellness coaching. It also hosts a diagnostic imaging center, nutrition service department, as well as a functional kinesiology department and also offers healthcare classes.\n\nThere are over 70 clubs and organizations on campus. 51% of the students are female and 49% are male. 38% of Life University's student body are minority students and more than 45 countries are represented by international students.\n\nLife University teams, known as the Running Eagles, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division I level, primarily competing in the Mid-South Conference, effectively in the 2014–15 season. They formerly competed in the defunct TranSouth Athletic Conference (TSAC) during its only season in 2012–13 before competing as an Independent in the 2013–14 season. Men's intercollegiate sports include basketball, rugby, wrestling, swimming, volleyball, bowling and soccer; women's intercollegiate sports include basketball, volleyball, soccer, swimming, lacrosse, cross country, indoor/outdoor track, wrestling, bowling and rugby; co-ed intercollegiate sports include competitive cheerleading.\n\nLife U's most notable sport is rugby. Life U's rugby program began in 1980. In 1982, Life U reached the finals of the collegiate national championships, losing to the University of California Golden Bears. Life U's undergraduate rugby program was reintroduced as a varsity sport and began play during the 2010–2011 season.\n\nThe Running Eagles were led by Head Coach Dan Payne from 2009 to 2013, who has both played for and been an assistant coach for the U.S. national rugby team. In 2014, Life U added a varsity women's rugby program. The Running Eagles reached the national quarterfinals in 2011 in its first season. Life U reached the national semifinals in the 2011-12 season, and finished the season ranked #2 in the country. Life U won the USA Rugby national championship in 2013, beating St. Mary's with a come-from-behind win in the final.\n\nLife University has been successful in rugby sevens. Life U won the 2011 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships. Life U won the spring 2012 Las Vegas Invitational, earning a berth at the June 2012 Collegiate Rugby Championship, where Life U went undefeated in pool play and reached the semifinals. The CRC tournament, played at PPL Park in Philadelphia, is the highest profile college rugby tournament in the US and is broadcast live every year on NBC. Life U won the fall 2012 South Independent 7s tournament. This victory earned Life an automatic berth and a chance to defend its title at the fall 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, where Life U went 5–1 and finished second in the tournament, losing in the Cup Championship match to rival Arkansas State. In 2013, Life U went 5–1 at the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships to finish 5th.\n\nSince 1986, Life U has played at a senior level, including a stint in the Rugby Super League from 1997 to 2002. Life U rejoined the RSL in 2009. In 2000, Life U won the Rugby Super League National Championship, and in 2007, Life University's rugby team was ranked number one of the Division 1 clubs in the nation. It played the 2013 USA Rugby Elite Cup and later joined the American Rugby Premiership.\n\nOther intercollegiate sports and club sports include basketball, volleyball, soccer, hockey, wrestling. Life won the NAIA Men's Basketball Championships in 1997, 1999 and 2000, and were runner-up in 1994 and 2017.\n\n"}

It is a colourless volatile liquid that is explosive.\n\nIt can be produced by the condensation of nitric acid and methanol:\n\nMethyl nitrate can be produced on a laboratory or industrial scale either through the distillation of a mixture of methanol and nitric acid, or by the nitration of methanol by a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. The first procedure is not preferred due to the great explosion danger presented by the methyl nitrate vapour. The second procedure is essentially identical to that of making nitroglycerin. However, the process is usually run at a slightly higher temperature and the mixture is stirred mechanically on an industrial scale instead of with compressed air.\n\nMethyl nitrate is a sensitive explosive. When ignited it burns extremely fiercely with a gray-blue flame. Methyl nitrate is a very strong explosive, like nitroglycerin, ethylene glycol dinitrate, and other nitrate esters. The sensitivity of methyl nitrate to initiation by detonation is among the greatest known, with even a number one blasting cap, the lowest power available, producing a near full detonation of the explosive.\n\nDespite the superior explosive properties of methyl nitrate, it has not received application as an explosive due mostly to its high volatility, which prevents it from being stored or handled safely. It was used as a rocket fuel by Germany in World War II, in a mixture containing 25% methanol, which was named \"myrol\". This mixture would evaporate at a constant rate and so its composition would not change over time. It presents a slight explosive danger (it is somewhat difficult to detonate) and does not detonate easily via shock.\n\nAs well as being an explosive, methyl nitrate is toxic and causes headaches when inhaled.\n"}

{"id": "2237689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237689", "title": "Immigration Restriction Act 1901", "text": "Immigration Restriction Act 1901\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was an Act of the Parliament of Australia which limited immigration to Australia and formed the basis of the White Australia policy which sought to exclude all non-Europeans from Australia. The law granted immigration officers a wide degree of discretion to prevent individuals from entering Australia. The Act prohibited various classes of people from immigrating and provided for illegal immigrants to be deported.\n\nBecause of opposition from the British government, a more explicit racial policy was avoided in the legislation, with the control mechanism for people deemed undesirable being a dictation test, which required a person seeking entry to Australia to write out a passage of fifty words dictated to them in any European language, not necessarily English, at the discretion of an immigration officer. The test was not designed to allow immigration officers to evaluate applicants on the basis of language skills, rather the language chosen was always one known beforehand that the person would fail.\n\nThe initial bill was based on similar legislation in South Africa.\n\nThe Act specifically prohibited various classes of people from immigrating, including people with infectious diseases and people who had recently been imprisoned.\n\nThe Act automatically allowed certain classes of people to enter Australia, such as all members of the British Army or the Royal Navy, the captain and crew of any ship visiting an Australian port, any person sent on the business of a foreign government, family members of permitted immigrants, and former residents of Australia.\n\nProspective immigrants were allowed to apply for a Certificate of Exemption, issued by the Minister for External Affairs (or a representative), which would exempt a person from the provisions of the Act such as the dictation test for a specified time.\n\nThe Act provided that any would-be immigrant could be subjected to a 50-word dictation test:\n\nSuch a person would be a \"prohibited immigrant\" and was to be prevented from landing.\n\nThis was similar to tests previously used in Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. It enabled immigration officials to exclude individuals on the basis of race without explicitly saying so. After 1903 the passage chosen was not important in itself as it was already decided the person could not enter Australia and so failure was inevitable. Although the test could theoretically be given to any person arriving in Australia, in practice it was given selectively on the basis of race, and others considered undesirables. Between 1902 and 1909, 52 people passed the test out of 1,359 who were given it.\n\nThe Act established a range of federal crimes relating to immigration. Illegal immigrants could be imprisoned for up to six months, and could then be deported. Both the captain and the owners of ships which transported illegal immigrants to Australia could be fined GBP 100 for each immigrant, unless the immigrant was European. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was also able to detain ships which were suspected of carrying illegal immigrants. People who brought ill or insane immigrants into Australia were also liable for the costs of caring for them, on top of other penalties.\n\nThe dictation test came into disrepute when it began to be used to exclude and deport individuals which the government considered undesirable.\n\nJewish political activist Egon Kisch from Czechoslovakia, who was exiled from Germany for opposing Nazism, arrived in Australia in 1934. The Government of Joseph Lyons went to extraordinary lengths to exclude Kisch, including using the dictation test. Kisch was fluent in a number of European languages, and after completing passages in several languages, he finally failed when he was tested in Scottish Gaelic. The officer who tested him had grown up in northern Scotland, and did not have a particularly good grasp of Scottish Gaelic himself. In the High Court case of \"R v Wilson; ex parte Kisch\" the court found that Scottish Gaelic was not within the fair meaning of the Act, and overturned Kisch's convictions for being an illegal immigrant. The failure to exclude Kisch brought the dictation test into widespread public ridicule.\n\nIn 1936, the dictation test was controversially used again to exclude Mabel Freer, a white British woman born in India. She was twice set the test in Italian, which she failed. In the face of a long press and legal campaign for her admission, the government was unable or unwilling to provide a convincing reason for her exclusion and eventually she was admitted, welcomed by a huge crowd at the quay in Sydney. Interior Minister Thomas Paterson resigned from the Lyons Cabinet in 1937 as a result of the controversy.\n\nAt first the dictation test had to be given in any European language and the dictation test could be administered any time within the first year of a person's arrival to Australia. In 1905 the Act was amended so that the dictation could be submitted in \"any prescribed language\", the restriction to European languages remaining active until such prescribed language be chosen by the Parliament. This wording was used to placate the objection from Japan that only European languages could be used. As the Parliament never prescribed any language, the dictation case remained limited to European languages only—and more specifically to the main language of any European nation, as illustrated in the infamous Attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia.\n\nIn 1932 the period during which the test could be given was extended to the first five years of residence and officials could give the test to an individual an unlimited number of times.\n\nThe \"Immigration Restriction Act\" was replaced by the \"Migration Act 1958\", which replaced the dictation test with a universal visa system (or entry permits), and removed many of the other restrictions, although many migrants from southern Europe and Asia were already living in Australia, some of them having arrived as refugees during or after World War II.\n\n\n\n"}

The Old Fire caused at least $1.2 billion in damages.\n\nThe Old Fire was one of 15 wildfires throughout Southern California that month, which became known as the \"2003 Firestorm\" and the \"Fire Siege of 2003.\" This included the huge Cedar Fire, what was then the second-largest fire in California's history after the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889.\n\nFanned by the Santa Ana winds, the Old Fire burned , destroyed 993 homes, and caused six deaths. The fire threatened San Bernardino and Highland, as well as the mountain resort communities of Cedar Glen, Crestline, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead and forcing upwards of 80,000 residents to evacuate their homes. Part of California State University, San Bernardino burned during the fire.\n\nThe fire was fully contained on November 2, 2003 with the help of rain and snow. The final cost of fighting the fire was $42 million. The Lake Arrowhead community is now part of a Redevelopment Agency which is controlled by a Board of Supervisors.\n\nA United States Forest Service report on the \"true\" combined costs of the 2003 Old Fire, Padua, and the Grand Prix wildfires (the Grand Prix Fire merged with the Old Fire and the part of the Grand Prix Fire that crossed into Los Angeles County was known as the \"Padua Fire\") was nearly $1.3 billion. When cleanup, watershed damages and other costs are considered beyond the expenses for firefighting and property damage, wildfire impacts are much higher. About were blackened across five southern California counties.\n\nIn 2009, Rickie Lee Fowler was charged with igniting the Old Fire. Authorities charged that he was a passenger in a white van seen leaving the area where the fire started, and that Fowler was the person seen throwing a lit flare into brush by the side of the road. The driver of the van, Martin David Valdez, Jr., died of a gunshot wound in 2006. A grand jury indicted Fowler on October 19, 2009, with one count of arson of an inhabited structure, one count of aggravated arson, and five counts of murder, based on five residents in the burn evacuation areas who died of heart attacks. Although a sixth man also died of a heart attack after the fire was set, prosecutors were unable to directly link that death to the stress of the fire. Similarly, although the fire stripped the soil of vegetation and destabilized the slopes, no one was charged in the deaths of fourteen people killed two months later when a mudslide ripped through a camp in Waterman Canyon.\n\nOn January 21, 2010, the San Bernardino County prosecutor announced that he would seek the death penalty. Fowler then recanted his confession, saying that he had admitted to the crime only to appease authorities so that he could be transferred to a prison closer to his mother.\n\nIn September 2011, Fowler moved to dismiss the indictment because the prosecutors had failed to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. In January 2012, he was reportedly discussing a plea bargain, but no plea bargain was reached and the case went to trial.\n\nThe trial started July 2012 in San Bernardino. rescheduled from January, Prosecutors charged special circumstances which can bring the death penalty. On August 15, 2012, Fowler was convicted of five counts of murder and two counts of arson. On September 28, 2012, the jury returned a verdict of death. The death verdict was affirmed by the trial judge on January 28, 2013.\n\nOn August 7, 2007, local newspapers reported that 25-year-old Jeremiah D. Hope, of Riverside, faced federal charges for starting a blaze that eventually merged with the Old Fire. Authorities said Hope had been evacuated from his Crestline home when he and some friends off-roaded onto dry vegetation in order to get a better view of the Old Fire. The vehicle's catalytic converter reportedly sparked a second fire near Playground Road, which firefighters dubbed the Playground Fire. That fire quickly consumed forest land and later became part of the Old Fire. Hope faced misdemeanor counts of causing the national forest to burn without a permit and one count of placing a vehicle in a dangerous area.\n\nThe victims identified were Charles Howard Cunningham, 93, of San Bernardino; Ralph Eugene McWilliams, 67, of Cedar Glen; Chad Leo Williams, 70, of Crestline; James William McDermoth, 70, of San Bernardino; and Robert Norman Taylor, 54, of San Bernardino. All five victims died from indirect consequences of the fire, due to heart attacks brought on by physical or emotional strain.\n\n\n"}

Forestville is 12 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Forestville is part of the Northern Beaches region and also considered to be part of the Forest District, colloquially known as \"The Forest\".\n\nForestville's location is at a junction between Sydney's North Shore and Northern Beaches and is often considered to be part of both, with Middle Harbour forming the boundary of this distinction. \nThe suburb is bound to the east and west by bushland of the Garigal National Park\nand to the south by Middle Harbour.\n\nFlora and fauna thrive in Garigal National Park and nearby Davidson National Park, with the area, along with Frenchs Forest, Belrose and Terrey Hills, receiving some of the highest rainfall in Sydney.\n\nForestville means \"town in the forest\". This area was originally thick wooded forest until James French settled here and began felling timber in 1856 and eventually built a small wharf on Bantry Bay to ship timber to Sydney. French later acquired more land in the adjacent suburb which bears his name, Frenchs Forest. The area was used for so called \"soldier settlement\" farms after the 2nd world war with very mixed success. Much of the land, particularly toward Killarney Heights was totally unsuitable for any type of farming and was developed as housing land in the early 1960s.\n\n\"French's Forest Settlement\" Post Office opened in 1920 and was renamed \"Forestville\" in 1947.\n\n\"Forestville Village Shops\" - or The Centre - is the suburb's main shopping centre located on Darley and Starkey Streets with a Coles supermarket and a variety of specialty shops, services and food options.\n\nA few shops are located along Arthur Street, including a cafe, physiotherapist and chiropractor.\n\nForestville is also formerly the home to the office and call centre of the NSW Wildlife Information and Rescue Service (WIRES), which has since relocated to nearby Brookvale. Cook Street is also home to many DIY shops such as a Mitre 10 (also known by its original name \"Eatons\") and multiple car service centres and other industries.\n\nDotted with many parks and reserves and almost completely surrounded by beautiful bushland with lots of native flora and fauna, Forestville is a low density housing area consisting of mostly family homes with medium-sized backyards. The housing style is mixed.\n\nMany of the timber Soldiers Cottages that were originally built in the 1950s and early 1960s have gradually been replaced by large project homes and smaller townhouse villas. However there is increasingly a trend towards renovating and preserving the original cottages or building architect-designed houses which sit well in the bushland setting. It's this organic approach to housing development by Warringah council and the wider Forestville community that has allowed Forestville and the surrounding neighbourhoods like Killarney Heights and Frenchs Forest to grow and expand yet still maintain their unique bushland identity and local character.\n\nThere are three primary schools in Forestville, Our Lady of Good Counsel, Forestville Montessori School and Forestville Public School. The nearest high school is Killarney Heights High School and other high schools nearby are The Forest High School in Frenchs Forest and Davidson High School in Frenchs Forest. There is also the Aspect Vern Barnett School for children with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nThere are a number of churches in Forestville:\n\nSporting facilities in Forestville include sporting fields, tennis and netball courts which local teams such as Forest Killarney Soccer Club, Forest Netball Club, Forest Rugby Club and the Forestville Ferrets Junior Rugby League Football Club call home ground. There is a Returned Services League Centre (RSL) nearby called The Forest Club.\n\nAt the 2016 census, there were 8,329 residents in Forestville. The median age of 42 was higher than the national median of 38, and 20.2% of the population were aged 65 years and over. The most common ancestries in Forestville were English 26.8%, Australian 21.4%, Irish 8.1%, Scottish 6.7% and Chinese 5.6%.\n\n65.9% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 6.0%, China 2.5%, New Zealand 2.1% and South Africa 1.4%. 74.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Armenian 3.5%, Cantonese 2.7%, Mandarin 2.6%, French 1.9% and Japanese 1.5%. The most common responses for religion in Forestville were No Religion 9.7%, Catholic 23.8% and Anglican 18.2%.\n\nFollowing a redistribution in December 2009, Forestville residents may be allocated to one of two Federal electorates. This could be either the Division of Warringah or the Division of Mackellar. Forestville is home to the former Federal MP for Warringah, and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\n\nWarringah Road is the main thoroughfare that connects Forestville to the adjacent suburbs of Roseville Chase and Frenchs Forest. Two different bus companies operate in Forestville. The privately held Forest Coach Lines operates numerous routes through the suburb, connecting Forestville to the Sydney CBD, Chatwsood, Terrey Hills, Mona Vale and Warringah Mall. The State owned Sydney buses operate a single bus route, which runs from Chatswood to Manly and passes through Forestville.\n"}

{"id": "2237734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237734", "title": "Mundell–Fleming model", "text": "Mundell–Fleming model\n\nThe Mundell–Fleming model, also known as the IS-LM-BoP model (or IS-LM-BP model), is an economic model first set forth (independently) by Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming. The model is an extension of the IS–LM model. Whereas the traditional IS-LM model deals with economy under autarky (or a closed economy), the Mundell–Fleming model describes a small open economy. Mundell's paper suggests that the model can be applied to Zurich, Brussels and so on.\n\nThe Mundell–Fleming model portrays the short-run relationship between an economy's nominal exchange rate, interest rate, and output (in contrast to the closed-economy IS-LM model, which focuses only on the relationship between the interest rate and output). The Mundell–Fleming model has been used to argue that an economy cannot simultaneously maintain a fixed exchange rate, free capital movement, and an independent monetary policy. An economy can only maintain two of the three at the same time. This principle is frequently called the \"impossible trinity,\" \"unholy trinity,\" \"irreconcilable trinity,\" \"inconsistent trinity,\" \"policy trilemma,\" or the \"Mundell–Fleming trilemma.\"\n\nBasic assumptions of the model are as follows:\n\nThis model uses the following variables:\n\nThe Mundell–Fleming model is based on the following equations:\n\nThe IS curve:\nwhere \"NX\" is net exports.\n\nThe LM curve:\nA higher interest rate or a lower income (GDP) level leads to lower money demand.\n\nThe BoP (Balance of Payments) Curve:\nwhere BoP is the balance of payments surplus, \"CA\" is the current account surplus, and \"KA\" is the capital account surplus.\n\nwhere \"E\"(π) is the expected rate of inflation. Higher disposable income or a lower real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus expected inflation) leads to higher consumption spending.\n\nwhere \"Y\" is GDP in the previous period. Higher lagged income or a lower real interest rate leads to higher investment spending.\n\nwhere \"NX\" is net exports, \"e\" is the nominal exchange rate (the price of foreign currency in terms of units of the domestic currency), \"Y\" is GDP, and \"Y*\" is the combined GDP of countries that are foreign trading partners. Higher domestic income (GDP) leads to more spending on imports and hence lower net exports; higher foreign income leads to higher spending by foreigners on the country's exports and thus higher net exports. A higher \"e\" leads to higher net exports.\n\nwhere \"CA\" is the current account and \"NX\" is net exports. That is, the current account is viewed as consisting solely of imports and exports.\nwhere formula_9 is the foreign interest rate, \"k\" is the exogenous component of financial capital flows, \"z\" is the interest-sensitive component of capital flows, and the derivative of the function \"z\" is the degree of capital mobility (the effect of differences between domestic and foreign interest rates upon capital flows \"KA\").\n\nAfter the subsequent equations are substituted into the first three equations above, one has a system of three equations in three unknowns, two of which are GDP and the domestic interest rate. Under flexible exchange rates, the exchange rate is the third endogenous variable while BoP is set equal to zero. In contrast, under fixed exchange rates \"e\" is exogenous and the balance of payments surplus is determined by the model.\n\nUnder both types of exchange rate regime, the nominal domestic money supply \"M\" is exogenous, but for different reasons. Under flexible exchange rates, the nominal money supply is completely under the control of the central bank. But under fixed exchange rates, the money supply in the short run (at a given point in time) is fixed based on past international money flows, while as the economy evolves over time these international flows cause future points in time to inherit higher or lower (but pre-determined) values of the money supply.\n\nThe model's workings can be described in terms of an IS-LM-BoP graph with the domestic interest rate plotted vertically and real GDP plotted horizontally. The IS curve is downward sloped and the LM curve is upward sloped, as in the closed economy IS-LM analysis; the BoP curve is upward sloped unless there is perfect capital mobility, in which case it is horizontal at the level of the world interest rate.\n\nIn this graph, under less than perfect capital mobility the positions of both the IS curve and the BoP curve depend on the exchange rate (as discussed below), since the IS-LM graph is actually a two-dimensional cross-section of a three-dimensional space involving all of the interest rate, income, and the exchange rate. However, under perfect capital mobility the BoP curve is simply horizontal at a level of the domestic interest rate equal to the level of the world interest rate.\n\nAs explained below, whether domestic monetary or fiscal policy is potent, in the sense of having an effect on real GDP, depends on the exchange rate regime. The results are summarized here.\n\nFlexible exchange rates: Domestic monetary policy affects GDP, while fiscal policy does not.\n\nFixed exchange rates: Fiscal policy affects GDP, while domestic monetary policy does not.\n\nIn a system of flexible exchange rates, central banks allow the exchange rate to be determined by market forces alone.\n\nAn increase in money supply shifts the LM curve to the right. This directly reduces the local interest rate relative to the global interest rate. That being said, capital outflows will increase which will lead to a decrease in the real exchange rate, ultimately shifting the IS curve right until interest rates equal global interest rates (assuming horizontal BOP). A decrease in the money supply causes the exact opposite process.\n\nAn increase in government expenditure shifts the IS curve to the right. This will mean that domestic interest rates and GDP rise. However, this increase in the interest rates attracts foreign investors wishing to take advantage of the higher rates, so they demand the domestic currency, and therefore it appreciates. The strengthening of the currency will mean it is more expensive for customers of domestic producers to buy the home country's exports, so net exports will decrease, thereby cancelling out the rise in government spending and shifting the IS curve to the left. Therefore, the rise in government spending will have no effect on the national GDP or interest rate.\n\nAn increase in the global interest rate shifts the BoP curve upward and causes capital flows out of the local economy. This depreciates the local currency and boosts net exports, shifting the IS curve to the right. Under less than perfect capital mobility, the depreciated exchange rate shifts the BoP curve somewhat back down. Under perfect capital mobility, the BoP curve is always horizontal at the level of the world interest rate. When the latter goes up, the BoP curve shifts upward by the same amount, and stays there. The exchange rate changes enough to shift the IS curve to the location where it crosses the new BoP curve at its intersection with the unchanged LM curve; now the domestic interest rate equals the new level of the global interest rate.\n\nA decrease in the global interest rate causes the reverse to occur.\n\nIn a system of fixed exchange rates, central banks announce an exchange rate (the parity rate) at which they are prepared to buy or sell any amount of domestic currency. Thus net payments flows into or out of the country need not equal zero; the exchange rate \"e\" is exogenously given, while the variable BoP is endogenous. \n\nUnder the fixed exchange rate system, the central bank operates in the foreign exchange market to maintain a specific exchange rate. If there is pressure to devalue the domestic currency's exchange rate because the supply of domestic currency exceeds its demand in foreign exchange markets, the local authority buys domestic currency with foreign currency to decrease the domestic currency's supply in the foreign exchange market. This keeps the domestic currency's exchange rate at its targeted level. If there is pressure to appreciate the domestic currency's exchange rate because the currency's demand exceeds its supply in the foreign exchange market, the local authority buys foreign currency with domestic currency to increase the domestic currency's supply in the foreign exchange market. Again, this keeps the exchange rate at its targeted level.\n\nIn the very short run the money supply is normally predetermined by the past history of international payments flows. If the central bank is maintaining an exchange rate that is consistent with a balance of payments surplus, over time money will flow into the country and the money supply will rise (and vice versa for a payments deficit). If the central bank were to conduct open market operations in the domestic bond market in order to offset these balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply — a process called sterilization – it would absorb newly arrived money by decreasing its holdings of domestic bonds (or the opposite if money were flowing out of the country). But under perfect capital mobility, any such sterilization would be met by further offsetting international flows.\n\nIncreased government expenditure shifts the \"IS\" curve to the right. The shift results in an incipient rise in the interest rate, and hence upward pressure on the exchange rate (value of the domestic currency) as foreign funds start to flow in, attracted by the higher interest rate. However, the exchange rate is controlled by the local monetary authority in the framework of a fixed exchange rate system. To maintain the exchange rate and eliminate pressure on it, the monetary authority purchases foreign currency using domestic funds in order to shift the LM curve to the right. In the end, the interest rate stays the same but the general income in the economy increases. In the IS-LM-BoP graph, the IS curve has been shifted exogenously by the fiscal authority, and the IS and BoP curves determine the final resting place of the system; the LM curve merely passively reacts.\n\nThe reverse process applies when government expenditure decreases.\n\nTo maintain the fixed exchange rate, the central bank must accommodate the capital flows (in or out) which are caused by a change of the global interest rate, in order to offset pressure on the exchange rate.\n\nIf the global interest rate increases, shifting the BoP curve upward, capital flows out to take advantage of the opportunity. This puts pressure on the home currency to depreciate, so the central bank must buy the home currency — that is, sell some of its foreign currency reserves — to accommodate this outflow. The decrease in the money supply, resulting from the outflow, shifts the LM curve to the left until it intersects the IS and BoP curves at their intersection. Once again, the LM curve plays a passive role, and the outcomes are determined by the IS-BoP interaction.\n\nUnder perfect capital mobility, the new BoP curve will be horizontal at the new world interest rate, so the equilibrium domestic interest rate will equal the world interest rate.\n\nIf the global interest rate declines below the domestic rate, the opposite occurs. The BoP curve shifts down, foreign money flows in and the home currency is pressured to appreciate, so the central bank offsets the pressure by selling domestic currency (equivalently, buying foreign currency). The inflow of money causes the LM curve to shift to the right, and the domestic interest rate becomes lower (as low as the world interest rate if there is perfect capital mobility).\n\nSome of the results from this model differ from those of the IS-LM model because of the open economy assumption. Results for a large open economy, on the other hand, can be consistent with those predicted by the IS-LM model. The reason is that a large open economy has the characteristics of both an autarky and a small open economy. In particular, it may not face perfect capital mobility, thus allowing internal policy measures to affect the domestic interest rate, and it may be able to sterilize balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply (as discussed above).\n\nIn the IS-LM model, the domestic interest rate is a key component in keeping both the money market and the goods market in equilibrium. Under the Mundell–Fleming framework of a small economy facing perfect capital mobility, the domestic interest rate is fixed and equilibrium in both markets can only be maintained by adjustments of the nominal exchange rate or the money supply (by international funds flows).\n\nThe Mundell–Fleming model applied to a small open economy facing perfect capital mobility, in which the domestic interest rate is exogenously determined by the world interest rate, shows stark differences from the closed economy model.\n\nConsider an exogenous increase in government expenditure. Under the IS-LM model, the IS curve shifts rightward, with the LM curve intact, causing the interest rate and output to rise. But for a small open economy with perfect capital mobility and a flexible exchange rate, the domestic interest rate is predetermined by the horizontal BoP curve, and so by the LM equation given previously there is exactly one level of output that can make the money market be in equilibrium at that interest rate. Any exogenous changes affecting the IS curve (such as government spending changes) will be exactly offset by resulting exchange rate changes, and the IS curve will end up in its original position, still intersecting the LM and BoP curves at their intersection point.\n\nThe Mundell–Fleming model under a fixed exchange rate regime also has completely different implications from those of the closed economy IS-LM model. In the closed economy model, if the central bank expands the money supply the LM curve shifts out, and as a result income goes up and the domestic interest rate goes down. But in the Mundell–Fleming open economy model with perfect capital mobility, monetary policy becomes ineffective. An expansionary monetary policy resulting in an incipient outward shift of the LM curve would make capital flow out of the economy. The central bank under a fixed exchange rate system would have to instantaneously intervene by selling foreign money in exchange for domestic money to maintain the exchange rate. The accommodated monetary outflows exactly offset the intended rise in the domestic money supply, completely offsetting the tendency of the LM curve to shift to the right, and the interest rate remains equal to the world rate of interest.\n\nOne of the assumptions of the Mundell–Fleming model is that domestic and foreign securities are perfect substitutes. Provided the world interest rate formula_10 is given, the model predicts the domestic rate will become the same level of the world rate by arbitrage in money markets. However, in reality, the world interest rate is different from the domestic rate. Rüdiger Dornbusch considered how exchange rate expectations have an effect on the exchange rate. Given the approximate formula:\nand if the elasticity of expectations formula_12, is less than unity, then we have\nSince domestic output is formula_14, the differentiation of income with regard to the exchange rate becomes\nThe standard IS-LM theory gives us the following basic relations:\nInvestment and consumption increase as the interest rates decrease, and currency depreciation improves the trade balance.\nThen the total differentiations of trade balance and the demand for money are derived.\nand then, it turns out that\nThe denominator is positive, and the numerator is positive or negative. Thus, a monetary expansion, in the short run, does not necessarily improve the trade balance. This result is not compatible with what the Mundell-Fleming predicts. This is a consequence of introducing exchange rate expectations which the MF theory ignores. Nevertheless, Dornbusch concludes that monetary policy is still effective even if it worsens a trade balance, because a monetary expansion pushes down interest rates and encourages spending. He adds that, in the short run, fiscal policy works because it raises interest rates and the velocity of money.\n\n\n"}

The Act established universal suffrage for federal elections for those who are British subjects over 21 years of age who have lived in Australia for six months, with some qualifications. It granted Australian women the right to vote at a national level, and to stand for election to the Parliament.\n\nThe Act meant that, though the Colony of New Zealand had granted women universal suffrage in 1893 and this carried forward to New Zealand subsequently becoming an independent nation in 1907, Australia was the first independent country to grant women's suffrage at a national level, and the first country to allow women to stand for Parliament. However, the Act also disqualified some Indigenous Australians, Asian people, African people and Pacific Islanders (except New Zealand Maori) from voting, even if they would otherwise be qualified as British subjects.\n\nThe act was replaced by the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\".\n\nThe Act was originally very short, having only five sections. The main provision was section three, which provided that electors in a federal election are naturally born British subjects over twenty-one years of age, male or female, married or single, who have lived in Australia for at least six months, and are on the electoral roll in any federal electoral division.\n\nAt the time whoever was considered a British subject was determined by rules of English commonwealth law, as an independent Australian citizenship was not introduced until 26 January 1949, with the coming into effect of the Australian nationality law, \"Australian Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948\".\n\nSection 4 of the Act made a range of disqualifications from the general definition in section 3.

A person who was under sentence or awaiting sentence for any offence which could be punished by imprisonment for one year or longer (under the law of Australia, or of the United Kingdom, or of any other Dominion of the Empire) was also not allowed to vote. People of \"unsound mind\" were also disqualified. Indigenous people from Australia, Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands, [excluding New Zealand and 'aboriginal native of Australia' entitled by Section 41 of the Constitution to vote in State Government elections], were not entitled to enroll to vote in an election of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.\n\nSection 41 of the Constitution provided in short that 'No adult person with a right to vote at an elections for a State Parliament can be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for the Parliament of the Commonwealth'.\n\nFor Example:Indian people were therefore not allowed to vote, even though they were citizens of the British Empire, unless they had voting right in the State in which they were resident.\n\nSection 44 of the Constitution disqualified a range of people from being elected to the House of Representatives or the Senate, such as any person with an allegiance to a foreign power (such as a citizen of another country), or anyone who was bankrupt or insolvent. However, these people were not prevented from voting by the Act.\n\nSection 5 provided that no person could vote more than once at an election.\n\nIn 1906 the 1902 Act was amended to allow postal voting. In 1908, a permanent electoral roll was established and in 1911, it became compulsory for all eligible voters to enroll on the electoral roll. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary. From 1912, elections have been held on Saturdays.\n\nBefore Federation of Australia in 1901, Australia consisted of six colonies, each with their own voting systems and franchise. Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia governed how the first federal election in 1901 was to be conducted. It provided that any person who was enrolled and eligible to vote in a State election could also vote in a federal election. Each state had a different system, with different criteria to determine who could vote. In South Australia and Western Australia, women could vote, and in Western Australia and Queensland, Indigenous people were specifically barred from voting.\n\nThe 1902 Commonwealth Act created a uniform voting system for federal elections across the country. The original bill was introduced into the Senate by Richard O'Connor, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and later in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne. It is unusual for being one of the few major pieces of legislation to be introduced in the Senate before the House.\n\nIn 1918, the 1902 Act was repealed and replaced by the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\". Many of the present features of the Australian electoral system were introduced after the 1918 Act came in force. Instant-runoff voting was introduced for the House of Representatives in 1918, compulsory voting was introduced in 1924, and the single transferable vote was introduced for the Senate in 1949. Indigenous Australians were granted the right to vote at federal elections in 1962. The qualifying voting age was lowered to 18 in 1973.\n\nBecause of Section 41 of the Constitution, women in South Australia and Western Australia were able to vote at federal elections. Although the original distribution between the states of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the number of male voters in each state, it was possible that later distributions could proportionally increase the number of seats given to South Australia and Western Australia, since they had proportionally more enrolled voters than their percentage of the population.\n\nMany politicians were concerned that allowing women to vote would discriminate in favour of married men, since, in the words of Sir Edward Braddon, \"the married man, happy in his family, whose wife's vote is one which he can command… will have two votes.\" Others, such as William Sawers, argued that because there were more women living in the cities, rural areas would become under-represented. Much of the opposition to the granting of women's suffrage in the Act was grounded in the belief that, in the words of William Knox, \"the main ambition of a woman's life should be to become the wife of an honorable and honest man.\" However, there was much support for granting the vote to women, and the bill was approved by large majorities in both Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe White Australia policy, or at least the ideas behind it, had been very strong since long before Federation. Although the \"Immigration Restriction Act 1901\" was established to prevent non-white people from migrating to Australia, significant numbers of foreign citizens, particularly Chinese people who migrated during the Victorian gold rush, were already living in Australia, and many politicians were keen to prevent them from having any political influence. Politicians also wanted to prevent Indigenous people from voting. Although Indigenous men had the right to vote everywhere except Western Australia and Queensland, and Indigenous women also had the right to vote in South Australia, this was not because it had explicitly been given to them, but because it had not explicitly been denied to them.\n\nPreventing non-white people from voting was an idea grounded in the philosophy of eugenics and scientific racism, which were popular ideas at the time. Whereas most Indigenous peoples were excluded from voting, Māori living in Australia were allowed to vote. During the parliamentary debates over the Act, King O'Malley (a radical and \"colourful\" politician) said that \"An Aboriginal is not as intelligent as a Māori. There is no scientific evidence that he is a human being at all.\"\n\nIn line with the attitudes of the time, the Act disqualified some Indigenous Australians, Asian people, African people and Pacific Islanders (except New Zealand Maori) from voting, even if they would otherwise be qualified as British subjects. In relation to Indigenous Australians, the Act providing that \"No aboriginal native of Australia ... shall be entitled to have his name placed on an Electoral Roll unless so entitled under section forty-one of the Constitution\". Section forty-one of the Constitution provided that all those entitled to vote in state elections under the state franchise could vote in Commonwealth elections. It was not clear whether that section was intended to be an ongoing provision, or only an interim measure for State electors enrolled at the time of Federation. The first Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, Robert Garran, gave it the second, narrower, interpretation.\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated some west of Huddersfield town centre, in the valley of the Longwood Brook, a tributary of the River Colne.\n\nThe village is the home of the Longwood Sing, an annual event, where choirs from around the area gather to sing hymns and songs. Near the amphitheatre, where the sing takes place, the folly Nab End Tower can be found. The tower was built in 1861 by unemployed local woollen mill workers. In 2008 it was restored by Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council at a cost of £200,000.\n\nThere are also three reservoirs that supply Huddersfield. They were built around 1840, although strengthening work in the 1930s makes them appear newer. One now covered and the lower reservoir looking more like a natural lake that is called a compensation reservoir - 'Compensation' as it was set up to compensate the mill owner for water lost from natural sources that now went to the main reservoirs to be distributed by the water corporation under 'rates' systems - although the mill owner was most likely the owner of the main reservoir too.\n\nDuring the 1840s, Longwood was the home to the Hanson family of Ballroyd. Mary Hanson set up a carrying business to supplement her husband's income from farming and soon the Hanson wagons were seen taking the Great North Road to London. James Hanson, founder and former chairman of Hanson plc, is a direct descendant of the Ballroyd family. When he was made a life peer, he took the title \"Baron Hanson of Edgerton\" after the nearby suburb of Edgerton.\n\nLongwood was built up around the woollen industry and its mills, most of which have now been demolished and replaced by housing. As a result of this the village has recently seen an influx of new inhabitants.\n\nIn 2005, a campaign was mounted to save the Longwood allotment plots (situated behind the Mechanics' Institute) from being developed into housing.\n\nLongwood Church is dedicated to St. Mark, and is in the Church of England parish of Huddersfield, being a perpetual curacy. Longwood is also home to the 27th Longwood Scout Group.\n\nThe name Longwood derives from Old English \"Lang wudu\", meaning \"The Long Wood\".\n\n<BR>\n"}
{"id": "2237748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237748", "title": "Service number", "text": "Service number\n\nA service number is an identification code used to identify a person within a large group. Service numbers are most often associated with the military; however, they may be used in civilian organizations as well. Social Security Numbers may be seen as types of service numbers.\n\nThe term \"serial number\" is often seen as a synonym of service number; however, a serial number more accurately describes manufacture and product codes, rather than personnel identification. In the Canadian military, a \"Serial Number\" referred to a unique number assigned each unit that mobilized for the Second World War.\n\nIn the First Australian Imperial Force soldiers were allotted numbers known as regimental numbers. These were allotted to NCOs and other ranks but not to officers or nurses, who had no numbers. Regimental numbers were rarely unique. Each battalion or corps had its own sequence, usually starting at 1, although some units were formed in the field and this did not occur. The result was that several dozen soldiers had the prestigious number 1, which was usually given to the Regimental Sergeant Major or the Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant. When soldiers were transferred from one unit to another, they often kept their number if it was not already held by someone else. Otherwise, they might be allotted a new number or the letter A or B might be added to make the number unique with their unit again. Re-enlisted soldiers often used the additional letter R. In 1917, the AIF switched to a scheme whereby reinforcements were drawn from the common pool instead of being supplied on a per-unit or corps basis. These were known as \"general reinforcements\" and they were allotted unique numbers in the range of 50000–80000. Despite the limitations of the scheme, in researching a soldier, it is handy to know the regimental number.\n\nIn 1921, the assignment of identifying numbers based on regiments was abolished in the Australian Army and replaced with an Army-wide system. This meant that soldiers in all branches of the Army received a unique number, and if they re-enlisted they kept their previously allocated number. \n\nThe problems inherent in the First World War scheme were acknowledged and all members of the Second Australian Imperial Force were allocated a unique service number known as an Army number. The first letter represented the state of enlistment: N: New South Wales; V: Victoria; Q: Queensland; S: South Australia; W: Western Australia; T: Tasmania; D: Northern Territory. The serial numbers of female soldiers followed this with an F. AIF serial numbers then had an X. A low number indicated an early enlistment. General Sir Thomas Blamey was VX1. Soldiers transferring from the Militia often kept their old number with 100,000 added, while PMF officers had 200,000 added.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the system employed by the Australian Army was quite complex, as the Second AIF was disbanded and an Interim Army was established. A dual system existed until July 1947 as existing personnel kept their Second AIF numbers until that point, while new enlistments received a service number starting from X500000, while maintaining the state-based prefix of the old Second AIF system. For the second half of 1947, numbers were allocated starting from X700000, again prefixed with the state of recruitment. However, from September 1947, another system based on military districts was introduced for members of the Australian Regular Army, while personnel who enlisted specifically for service during the Korean War with K-Force received numbers beginning from 400,000, although those who volunteered for service with the Regular Army Supplement received a new number beginning with 900,000 and others who transferred from the Interim Army to K-Force received a new number beginning with 905,000, beginning with a number from 1 to 8 representing each state and territory (beginning with Queensland), including Papua New Guinea. This system (the 900,000 series) remained in use until 2002, when it was replaced with an integrated system based on the Personnel Management Key Solution (PMKeyS) system, which moved the Australian Defence Force away from service numbers to employee numbers.\n\nCanada began using \"Regimental Numbers\" during the First World War.\n\nDuring the Second World War, units were allocated blocks of Regimental Numbers to issue out, usually in the 5 or 6 digit range, though extremely low numbers were also possible due to the blocks.\n\n\nThe Social Insurance Number (SIN) replaced the regimental number in the 1960s.\n\n\nThe SIN was itself replaced by a Service Number in the 1990s.\n\n\nThe use of the SIN was granted by Revenue Canada to the CF for service numbers as a temporary measure and was revoked in the 1990s. The new Service Number used a random alphabetic letter and 8 numbers in the same format as SINs to avoid changing service forms.\n\nIn Nazi Germany, the equivalent of a service number was known as a \"membership number\" which were issued by various Nazi groups based on when a person had initially joined. Nazi membership numbers were also preceded by the name of the organization to which the number applied. For instance, a person who was both a member of the SS and Nazi Party would state their numbers (as an example) \"\"NSDAP #15337 and SS #4436\". Membership numbers were considered extremely important in the Nazi system and to hold a low membership number was almost more important than what rank an individual presently had been granted.\n\nThe Wehrmacht did not use service numbers in the same sense as their western military counterparts. Soldiers were inducted in their home districts, and identity recorded in a master roster book. A position in the roster book served as a unique identifier; this number was recorded in the soldier's paybook, and was stamped on the soldier's \"Erkennungsmarke\" (identity disc, or \"dogtag\").\n\nCurrent officers of the Hong Kong Police use a 5 digit number and are worn by all ranks below senior officers.\n\nThe same numbering pattern is used by the Hong Kong Correctional Services and the Hong Kong Fire Services.\n\nSoldiers in the British Army are given an eight-digit number, e.g. 25232301. Prior to 1920, each regiment issued their own service numbers which were unique only within that regiment, so the same number could be issued many times in different regiments. When a serviceman moved, he would be given a new service number by his new regiment. Commissioned officers did not have service numbers until 1920. The modern system was introduced by Army Order 338 in August 1920. Numbers were then a maximum of seven digits, later groups of numbers up to eight digits were added.\n\nUntil 1960, National Servicemen who voluntarily remained in the Armed Forces continued to use their National Service numbers. Until 2007 and the introduction of the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system, Army Officers were issued with a six-digit Personal Number, as opposed to the eight-digit Army Number for enlisted personnel. Newly commissioned officers now receive an eight-digit service number, but six-digit Officers' Personal Numbers issued prior to the introduction of JPA remained unchanged.\n\nIn the Royal Navy, prior to the introduction of JPA, service numbers were also of eight digits but began and ended with a letter, depending initially on the depot where the sailor was recruited. The first letter designators were: P (Portsmouth), C (Chatham), and D (Devonport), with the final letter being a meaningless checksum. Later, the designators were reassigned and were used to distinguish between men and women within the Royal Navy as well as to distinguish between Officers and Ratings. A service number beginning with D designated a Royal Navy male Rating, W a Royal Navy female Rating, C male Officers, and V female Officers. P designated a Royal Marines Other Rank, while N a Royal Marine Officer. Following the introduction of JPA, all newly issued Royal Navy service numbers became an eight-digit number format beginning with 3, with no distinction made between male, female, Ratings, Officers, and Royal Marines.\n\nThe Armed forces of the United States introduced service numbers in 1918, and discontinued their use in 1974. In 2011, the Department of Defense began implementing a new service number system in order to reduce identity theft. The first U.S. military member to hold a service number was Arthur Crean.\n\nThe following formats were used to denote U.S. military service numbers:\n\n\nSocial Security Numbers are today used as the primary means to identify members of the U.S. military. The common format for social security numbers is 123-45-6789.\n\nEffective June 2011, the US military has introduced a plan to eliminate the use of Social Security Numbers on military and dependent ID cards, and replace them with a service number, in an effort to prevent identity theft against members of the armed services. All members have now been issued a DoD ID number for this purpose.\n"}

He started wrestling as Iron Mike McCord, a superheavyweight powerlifter in 1972, and became a star in a number of southeast promotions, holding many titles in the Memphis, Georgia, Birmingham, Texas All Star & Mid Atlantic territories. McCord also had a stint in the WWWF with Lou Albano as his manager. He also worked main event matches against then world champion Pedro Morales. McCord and wrestlers Gary Hart and Bobby Shane were passengers on a Cessna 182 flown by wrestler Buddy Colt, which crashed on February 20, 1975 into Tampa Bay in Florida, killing Shane.\n\nAfter a period of inactivity healing from two broken ankles, he emerged with bleach-blonde hair, over 100 lbs lighter, and the new ring name \"Universal Heartthrob\" Austin Idol.\n\nIdol is well known for a feud during the 1980s with the popular Jerry \"The King\" Lawler in the CWA and AWA territories. In a 1981 angle, Idol dressed up as a masked Mexican wrestler, presenting the \"Top Rated Wrestler in Mexico\" award to Lawler on TV before sucker-punching him. Afterwards, he delivered an interview where he promised to clean up Memphis and rid it of Lawler. Early in the year, Lawler burned Idol's neck in a match. On April 27, 1987, Idol defeated Lawler in a steel cage match with the assistance of \"Wildfire\" Tommy Rich, who hid underneath the ring for the entirety of the event, winning the AWA Southern Heavyweight championship and causing Lawler to lose his hair.\n\nIdol semi-retired in 1990, wrestling only every few years until the mid-1990s. In addition, he promoted his own promotion in Alabama in 1993. After appearing on Memphis Power Pro Wrestling's first television show in 1998, he officially retired. Idol has since become a popular motivational speaker.\n\nIn November 2012, Idol launched his new radio program \"Austin Idol Rock & Roll Wrestling Show\" broadcasting on American Hearts Network. Shortly after appearing on Jim Cornette's podcast \"Jim Cornette Experience\", he decided to host his own radio show called \"Austin Idol Live\" in early 2017. After 31 weekly podcasts, Austin Idol announced his retirement from the Podcast world on September 19, 2017 (episode #32), citing new ventures ahead.\n\nOn December 9, 2017, Idol appeared at Combat Zone Wrestling's Cage of Death 19.

It is one of a group of species known commonly as bearded dragons. Other common names for this species include Jew lizard and frilly lizard, the latter being a confusion between this and another dragon, the frill-necked lizard (\"Chlamydosaurus kingii\"). This species was originally described in 1829 by Georges Cuvier, who named it \"Amphibolurus barbatus\".\n\n\"P. barbata\" is one of the eight recognized species within the genus \"Pogona\". Adult males can grow to about from the snout to the tip of the tail, while females may reach in overall length.\n\nThe head is large and triangular in shape. The throat is covered with spiny, dark grey scales which can be raised to form an impressive \"beard\". Several groups of even longer spiny scales are located at the back of the head, the corners of the mouth, the external ear openings, and running posteriorly along both sides of the abdomen. The thorax and abdomen are relatively slender and flattened dorsoventrally.\n\nIt is usually grey-black or red in skin colour and is sometimes reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or dark brown. Juveniles are paler in colour than the adults and have patterns that fade as they mature. As the animal matures, it develops a subtle pale yellow, blue, or green tinge on the forepart of its head. If excited and at higher temperatures head, flanks and legs have a yellowish to orange colour. Usually however they are rather dark, from yellowish to grey and black. The inside of the mouth is generally a bright yellow colour.\n\n\"P. barbata\" resembles its close relative, the central bearded dragon, but may be distinguished from the latter by its less robust body and the row of spines along the lateral edge of the body, which continues over the forearm.\n\nIt is most common in eastern Australia south of Cape York Peninsula, but specimens have been collected from Cape York, through central Australia, and even from the west coast of Australia.\n\nEastern bearded dragons are diurnal. They are semiarboreal and perch on exposed places such as tree branches or logs, retreating to lower and cooler places when too hot. They are more aggressive than the central bearded dragon. The males are territorial and permit only females and juveniles in their territory. Dominant males are usually the biggest dragons and get the highest perches. Females tunnel into dry earth to lay a clutch of eggs.\n\nWhen threatened, it inflates its throat and displays its beard. If further provoked, it opens its mouth to display the bright yellow colour of the lining of its mouth. In its close relative, the central bearded dragon; the lining of the mouth is of a reddish-pink hue. However the eastern bearded dragon will perform this beard display more often than its cousin.\n\nRecent observations concluded that hot temperatures were responsible for some of eastern bearded dragon lizards to change their sex makeup. Some lizards changed their male appearance to female, and had offspring, besides having the male ZZ chromosomes, of the genetic male lizards.\n\nThe eastern bearded dragon feeds on a variety of small animals, including mice, smaller reptiles, and insects. In captivity, it also eats leaf vegetables such as clover and small flowers, fruits, and berries.\n\n"}

He was a [[caveman]] with the [[Wiktionary:beetle brow|beetle brows]] of a [[neanderthal]] who had fallen into a glacial [[crevasse]], or \"Big Giant Hole in Ice\", during the [[Ice Age]], thus preserving his body well enough for scientists to thaw him out in 1988. He subsequently studied law at the [[Oklahoma City University School of Law]]. The character exploits his humble origins with thinly-veiled cynicism in order to manipulate others.\n\nKeyrock became a defense and [[personal injury lawyer]], and in a later sketch, a politician running for the Senate on the platform of reducing the [[capital gains tax]]. He was portrayed as a selfish, well-dressed attorney who repeatedly claimed to be a simple-minded caveman, and would employ simple [[folk wisdom]] to win his cases. He also enjoyed significant wealth, driving luxury cars like BMWs and [[Range Rover]]s, as well as owning a home on [[Martha's Vineyard]].\n\n\"One hundred thousand years ago, a caveman was out hunting in the plains, when he slipped and fell into a crevasse, where he was frozen solid. In 1988, he was discovered by scientists and was thawed out. He then attended law school and became...The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer!\"\n\nThe scene would then be accompanied by a song, beginning \"He used to be a caveman...,\" showing Keyrock in animal skins beating a club against his hand, \"...but now he's a lawyer!\" and showing Keyrock's clothes changing from animal skins to a suit, and his club replaced by hands gesturing to emphasize a point: \"Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer!\"\n\nThe [[running gag]] was that Keyrock would speak in a slick and smoothly self-assured manner- but with obviously feigned naiveté- to a jury or an audience about how things in the modern world supposedly \"frighten and confuse\" him. He often emphasized the latter phrase with air-quotes or a showy gesture, which underscored his obvious disingenuousness. He would then list several things that confounded him about modern life or the natural world, such as: \"When I see a [[solar eclipse]], like the one I went to last year in Hawaii, I think 'Oh no! Is the moon eating the sun?' I don't know. Because I'm a caveman -- that's the way I think.\" This pronouncement would seem ironic, coming from someone who had, for example, just ended a brisk cell phone conversation, or indeed attended law school. Keyrock would always finish a disquisition, however, by asserting in a burst of righteousness that nevertheless, \"There is one thing I DO know...\" That one thing would be that his client was either innocent, or was entitled to several million dollars or more in both [[compensatory damages|compensatory]] and [[punitive damages]] for an injury. The jury or counsel is invariably swayed by Keyrock's argument, except every time the Judge announces the verdict in his favor, Keyrock is distracted by some other event like watching a [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] game on his portable TV (\"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I was distracted by the tiny people in this magic box\"), or by a cell phone call, and the verdict has to be repeated.\n\nThe scenes would usually end with a small \"outro\" scene of \"a sneak peek at the next episode\" showing Keyrock making arguments. One such scene diverted from the usual \"caveman argument\" when a tipsy Keyrock was aboard a plane, being told by a [[stewardess]] that the [[purser|chief steward]] has declared no more [[John Dewar & Sons|Dewar's]] and water would be served to Keyrock. The stewardess in that episode was not persuaded by Keyrock's whining that \"I'm just a caveman\" and that he is \"frightened by the flying machine,\" and continued her duties. An enraged Keyrock then roared \"Listen up, I will sue you and your whole crummy airline!\" What happened afterward remained to be seen, but it was one of the few cases Keyrock did not have his way.\n\nLike many \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches at that time, \"Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer\" was presented as a parody of a television show. During the opening and closing of the \"show,\" the announcer would list some of the \"show's\" highly unusual sponsors such as \"Big Fat Bean\" (\"Why eat a lot of little beans when you can eat one big bean?\"); \"Gas Plus\" (\"Actually \"gives\" you gas!\"); \"Dog Assassin\" (\"When you can't bear to put him to sleep, maybe it's time to call \"Dog Assassin\"\"); \"Cubic Yard of Earthworms\" (\"What you do with it is your business\"); \"Wilson Ear Drill\" (\"We don't recommend that you use an ear drill, but if you insist, why not get the best!\") and the popular [[Happy Fun Ball]] (\"still legal in 16 states — it's happy, it's fun, it's Happy Fun Ball!\").\n\nThe sketch was a parody of the \"simple country boy beats city slicker\" genre, such as then-popular series \"[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]\" in which an older, \"country-boy\" type Southern lawyer bamboozled \"big city\" or \"sophisticated\" lawyers. Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer upended the form by replacing the humble hero with a craven yuppie.\n\nThe full list of Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer \"sponsors\" include:\n\n\n\n[[Category:Saturday Night Live characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Saturday Night Live in the 1990s]]"}

Esther 9:31 states \"They had established for themselves and their descendants the matters of the fasts and their cry\", but this refers instead to the fasts mentioned in Zechariah 8:19.\n\nThe first mention of the fast of Esther is as a Minhag that is referenced in the Gaonic period. A 2010 study examines the origin of the fast and the reason for its arising in the Gaonic period.\n\nThe fast is observed on the 13th day of the Hebrew month of Adar. (When the year has two Adar months, it is observed only in the second Adar). If the date of the Fast of Esther falls on Shabbat (Saturday), the fast is instead observed on the preceding Thursday, as this was the case in 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2017. This will occur again in 2024. (Shulchan Aruch S.686 s.2)\n\nAs the fast of Esther is not one of the four public fasts ordained by the Prophets, the laws concerning its observance are more lenient; pregnant women, nursing mothers, and those who are weak are not required to observe it.\n\nThe Gregorian dates, from dawn until nightfall, for 2018–2020 are:\n\n\nIt is generally accepted in the rabbinic tradition that the original three-day \"Fast of Esther\" mentioned in chapter 4 of Book of Esther occurred on the 14th, 15th, and 16th days of Nisan, these being the eve and first two days of Passover. While halacha normally forbids fasting on Passover, it is believed that Esther reasoned it would be better to fast on one Pesach lest they all be destroyed and thus never be able to observe the holiday in the future. But due to the normal prohibition of fasting on Passover, the \"Fast of Esther\" instead became attached to the eve of Purim, the 13th of Adar.\n\nThe 13th of Adar itself is thought to have been a fast day for the warriors while going out to battle, as it is believed to have been customary to fast during the battle in order to gain divine favor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2237779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237779", "title": "Ernest Goes to Jail", "text": "Ernest Goes to Jail\n\nErnest Goes to Jail is a 1990 American comedy film directed by John R. Cherry III and starring Jim Varney. It is the fourth film to feature the character Ernest P. Worrell. It was shot in Nashville and Tennessee State Penitentiary. This is the second most successful of the Ernest films, behind \"Ernest Saves Christmas\". It was in third place during its opening weekend, earning $6,143,372. Its total gross was $25,029,569.\n\nSecurity guards Chuck and Bobby play a game of Red light/Green light while being night watchmen for Howard County Bank and Trust and are obsessed with elaborate schemes of would-be thieves. They hear a sound coming from a floor polisher that Ernest (who works as a night custodian but dreams of being a clerk) is trying to turn on for operation, but he ends up making a mess in the bank and he becomes magnetic from a mishap with the floor polisher. The next day, bank president Oscar Pendlesmythe's assistant, Charlotte Sparrow, orders him to clean up his supernatural mess. Pendlesmythe wants to terminate Ernest's employment at the bank, but Charlotte has a sympathetic attitude for misfits, so she argues on his behalf. Ernest takes a bath at home in a tumble dry washing machine and uses a blow dryer with a windtunnel force for his evening dinner with Charlotte in a restaurant. He later receives in the mail a summons stating that he has been selected for jury duty in court and tells the two watchmen about it. During the trial, Dracup Maximum Security Prison convict and defendant Rubin Bartlett notices that Ernest is a dead ringer for death row inmate Felix Nash. Per Bartlett's request, his lawyer convinces the jury to tour the prison, where Bartlett arranges for Ernest to be abducted by Nash and another inmate named Lyle and switched with Nash. After the jury returns to court, Nash tampers with the jury's verdict so that Bartlett is labeled not guilty, allowing Bartlett to return to jail and resume his current sentence. Even though Ernest tries to tell the guards he is not Nash, they refuse to believe him. Ernest also does not know that he has a death sentence, which is for Nash.\n\nWhile having lunch, a guard tells them to stand up and be quiet, when he notices Ernest is making a lot of noise, which almost sends him into the cell. Ernest tries to tell one of the prison guards that he is Ernest, not Nash, but the guard calls him \"Mr. Funny Man\" (which is a mistaken lie), angrily says that he is not funny, and is lying and throws him into the cell right in front of Lyle, who pushes him back. When he pushes him near the prison bars, he tells the guard that he was beaten up (and accidentally slamming the guard's head on the bars). The guard tells Ernest that he will be sent to the hole, which makes Ernest realize he is in jail. Bartlett returns to jail and tells Ernest that Nash has assumed his identity and warns him to be silent about the switch. Ernest makes several unsuccessful escape attempts, and is soon sent to the electric chair by Warden Carmichael (Charles Napier).\n\nThe electrocution fails, and Ernest is transformed into a type of superhuman, with the ability to shoot lightning bolts from his hands. To make his getaway, he blasts a hole in the main gates. However, Bartlett, refusing to let his plan go awry, obstructs Ernest's escape, intending to kill Ernest himself. Fortunately for Ernest, Lyle intervenes, knocks Bartlett unconscious and allows Ernest to make his escape, knowing that Ernest is different from everyone else. Ernest invites Lyle to come with him, but Lyle declines, claiming his place is in jail. Making his way home, he discovers that his childish Pee-wee Herman-esqe décor has been replaced by a slick Lounge Lizard style of décor and exclaims, \"I've been vandalized – by Elvis!\" Meanwhile, Nash is preparing to blast open the bank's vault with a time bomb, with Charlotte and an unconscious Chuck bound nearby. Charlotte begs Nash not to follow through with his plan, and he blurts the truth about being an impostor. Charlotte does not believe it until he points out he has done a far better job cleaning the floors than Ernest ever had. Ernest arrives and he and Nash do battle. Ernest gets electrocuted yet again when Nash harshly throws him against an electric cage that the bank had rigged to drop from the ceiling to catch robbers. Now Ernest has become polarized and gained the ability to fly. He uses his super powers to fly through the skylight of the bank with the bomb which leads to a spectacular mid-air explosion. Everyone thinks that Ernest has been killed, until he falls through the skylight and lands on Nash, which leads the warden and the guards to find out Ernest was right all along. Ernest tiredly declares, \"I came, I saw, I got blowed up.\" and then faints.\n\n\nThe reviews for the movie were universally negative.\n\nThe movie debuted at No. 3.\n\nOriginally released on Laserdisc and VHS in January 1991, with This film's first DVD release was on September 3, 2002 from Touchstone Home Entertainment. Mill Creek Entertainment re-released it on February 10, 2008 as part of the Ernest 2-Movie Collection with \"Slam Dunk Ernest\" and on January 18, 2011, as part of a two-disc set Ernest Triple Feature along with \"Ernest Goes to Camp\" and \"Ernest Scared Stupid\". They also released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011 in a single disc Double Feature set along with \"Ernest Goes to Camp\". The 2011 releases mark the first time the film has been available in widescreen.\n\nAn alternate edit of this film aired on NBC in August 1994, which contained several additional scenes not found on its home media releases, including an alternative ending scene where Ernest now works as a bank clerk, but another electrical mishap causes a file cabinet to fly towards him.\n\n"}

Adherents are expected to abstain from sex outside of matrimony, thus premarital, extramarital, or homosexual intimacy are excluded from allowable Baháʼí practices. Baháʼí institutions have taken no position on the sexual practices of those who are not adherents.\n\nThe scriptural basis for Baháʼí practices comes from the writings of Baháʼu'lláh (1817-1892), the faith's founder, who forbade fornication, adultery, and sodomy. The Baháʼí position towards homosexuality was elaborated on by Shoghi Effendi, Baháʼu'lláh's great grandson and appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957. He answered specific questions and described homosexuality as an affliction that should be overcome, while leaving Baháʼí membership open to anyone regardless of sexual orientation. This position leaves Baháʼís with a same-sex orientation under the same guidance as a heterosexual person, that is, if they find themselves unable to contract a marriage with someone of the opposite sex, they should remain celibate.\n\nThe supreme governing institution of the Baháʼí Faith is the Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, which has written more extensively on the subject of homosexuality. For example, they have clarified that Baháʼís should not single out homosexuality over other transgressions of Baháʼí conduct, should not treat those with a homosexual orientation with disdain or prejudice, should not expect that non-Baháʼís follow Baháʼí standards, and should neither promote nor necessarily oppose efforts to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nBaháʼí teachings stress the importance of absolute chastity for any unmarried person, and focus on personal restraint. The Baháʼí Faith, however, leaves the application of laws of social conduct largely up to the individual, and Baháʼís do not advocate for or discriminate against homosexual people.\n\nWhile in authoritative teachings homosexuality is described as a condition that an individual should control and overcome, Baháʼís are left to apply the teachings at their own discretion, and are discouraged from singling out homosexuality over other transgressions, such as the consumption of alcohol, or heterosexual promiscuity. Membership in the Baháʼí community is therefore open to lesbian and gay adherents.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith has been described as a religion \"ambiguous or contested on the issue of LGBT inclusion\". The religion has a strong emphasis on traditional values found in Abrahamic religions, which discourage liberal sexuality.\n\nBaháʼí teachings state that Baháʼís should not treat homosexual people as condemned outcasts, nor expect people who are not Baháʼí to follow Baháʼí laws. The Baháʼí writings teach adherents to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and to eschew an attitude of discrimination and social intolerance toward homosexuals.\n\nThe opportunity for civil same-sex marriage was mentioned in a 2010 letter by the Universal House of Justice as being a public issue that is not in keeping with the Baháʼí teachings, but one that Baháʼís \"would neither promote nor necessarily oppose.\"\n\nIndividuals with a same-sex orientation are not prevented from entering the religion and joining in community life; however, someone involved in a same-sex marriage or union will be prevented from registering as a Baháʼí. Like other Abrahamic religions, Baháʼí teachings make a distinction between those who have a same-sex attraction and those who practice homosexual relations.\n\nThe faith's guidelines recommend not emphasizing Baháʼí standards of conduct to new believers, but gradually introducing the idea of fully accepting all Baháʼí practices. Spiritual Assemblies, the local elected bodies that manage the affairs of the religion, are instructed to act patiently and persuade members to accept principles inwardly and “out of pure conviction and desire.” Although Baháʼís are forbidden to have sexual relationships outside of marriage, heterosexual or homosexual, new converts who are already engaged in such a relationship will be expected to make a sincere effort to conform to the Baháʼí teachings over a period of time.\n\nAs a general rule, the Spiritual Assemblies do not get involved in the private lives of believers, unless their actions are considered flagrantly immoral or to be causing some harm to the community.\n\nAn individual may be subject to administrative sanctions if a Spiritual Assembly decides that they are openly disregarding the Baháʼí teachings and their actions are damaging to the image of the Baháʼí Faith. This response removes the right to contribute to funds, vote in elections for spiritual assemblies, hold office, or attend the Nineteen Day Feast. It may be applied to extreme cases of alcoholism, sexual promiscuity, and anything that is considered flagrant immorality. However, this consequence is meant only to be applied in cases of \"public scandal\", \"very flagrant cases\", or if the conduct of the Baháʼí is \"seriously injuring the Faith in the eyes of the public\". In cases of Baháʼís who are flagrantly promiscuous, they are to be approached by a Spiritual Assembly and informed of the teachings on personal conduct. If after a probational period the person continues to present a disregard towards the laws in a public way, then the assembly may remove the person's administrative rights, \"administratively expelled from membership in the Baháʼí community\", though this action is not the same as ex-communication, as there is no directive to avoid fellowship with the individual.\n\nEarly letters written by Shoghi Effendi's secretaries on his behalf described those with a homosexual orientation as having a handicap that can be overcome \"through the advice and help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through prayer\".\n\nThe reference to overcoming or reversing a sexual orientation has garnered considerable criticism from those who regard it as innate and unchangeable. Conversion therapy has been largely condemned by many medical organizations, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, who see it as unethical to view a heterosexual orientation as preferable to a homosexual orientation.\n\nThe Universal House of Justice has written its own correspondence to individuals, encouraging them to divert thoughts into spiritual channels and the nature of man, and to \"resist wayward impulses each time they arise\". The Universal House of Justice has responded to research that claims that homosexuality is innate and not changeable by asserting that homosexuality is one of\n\nIt also argues that statistics may be distorted due to under-reporting, that other genetic predispositions to undesirable behaviors exist, and that other types of bias may exist in the present-day research.\n\nIn one passage of the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\", Baháʼu'lláh writes \"we shrink, for very shame, from treating the subject of boys.\" In the context of the original Arabic text, this passage implies pederasty, or erotic relations between adult males and adolescent boys. Such practices were not uncommon during the time of Baháʼu'lláh in the Islamic world, and in some cases were socially acceptable (see bacha bazi). Baháʼu'lláh condemned such relations, and Shoghi Effendi, the authorized interpreter of the Baháʼí writings, has more clearly defined a prohibition on all homosexual relations, stating that, \"No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really forbidden by Baháʼu'lláh, and homosexual relationships, He looks upon as such, besides being against nature.\"\n\nBaháʼu'lláh clearly forbade fornication and adultery, referring to any form of premarital or extramarital sexual intercourse. He also forbade sodomy and lechery. The Universal House of Justice, in its notes on the text of the \"Kitab-i-Aqdas\", stated that the Baha'i laws restrict \"permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married\".\n\nThe head of the Baháʼí Faith, the Universal House of Justice, has addressed the issue in letters in recent years and brief excerpts:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Like their neighbors to the north and south, the artistic traditions of the peoples of central New Ireland formerly focused largely around mortuary rites. In contrast to the intricate \"malagan\" carvings of the north, artists in central New Ireland produced less ornate but more permanent figures known as \"uli\", which were kept and reused many times. No longer made today, uli were displayed as part of lengthy fertility rites involving the exhumation and reburial of human skulls, which accompanied the planting of sacred plants. \n\nWhen a newly carved uli was brought out, a shaman assisted in inducing the spirit of the deceased chief to enter the carving, and after the ceremony, the work was kept in the \"men's house\" where it would continue to aid the successor and his people.\n\nUli figures appear hermaphroditic, having both a phallus and prominent breasts. This blending of male and female features possibly symbolized the fertile and nourishing powers of clan leaders, who were expected to provide for the other members of the clan.

He spent more than a decade and tremendous effort on it, and aspired for it to be \"the best work of my life and maybe of my time\".\nIt won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.Historically, it can be seen as a precursor to Joseph Heller's \"Catch-22\".\n\nThe book takes place in France during World War I and stretches through the course of one week in 1918. Corporal Stephan, who represents the reincarnation of Jesus, orders 3,000 troops to disobey orders to attack in the brutally repetitive trench warfare. In return, the Germans do not attack, and the war stops when soldiers realize that it takes two sides to fight a war. The Generalissimo, who represents leaders who use war to gain power, invites his German counterpart to discuss how to restart the war. He then arrests and executes Stefan. Before Stefan's execution, the Generalissimo tries to convince the corporal that war can never be stopped because it is the essence of human nature.\n\nFollowing the execution of the Corporal, his body is returned to his wife and his sisters, and he is buried in Vienne-la-pucelle. However, after the conflict has resumed, the Corporal's grave is destroyed in a barrage of artillery. The spirit of the Corporal has transferred to a British message runner, who eventually confronts the old Generalissimo.\n\nIn his contemporary review of \"A Fable\", Philip Blair Rice noted that the novel returned Faulkner in subject matter to the one general subject that engaged him besides Mississippi, the First World War. Dayton Kohler, in his contemporary analysis of the novel, discusses an approach to the novel through myth. Ernest Sandeen has elaborated in detail on the parallels between the corporal and Jesus Christ. Julian Smith has noted similarities between \"A Fable\" and Humphrey Cobb's novel \"Paths of Glory\". Frank Turaj has examined opposing images and themes in terms of the dialectic in the novel. Thomas E Connolly has discussed the relationship of the three main plots of the novel to each other.\n\nRichard H. King has interpreted \"A Fable\" as the one major attempt by Faulkner to depict political action in his novels, and has characterised the novel as \"Faulkner's failed political novel\". Robert W Hutten noted Faulkner's reworking of material originally from the story 'Notes on a Horse Thief' into \"A Fable\".

Whether a person is considered short depends on the context. Because of the lack of preciseness, there is often disagreement about the degree of shortness that should be called \"short\".\n\nIn a medical context, short stature is typically defined as an adult height that is more than two standard deviations below the mean for age and gender, which corresponds to the shortest 2.3% of individuals. In developed countries, this typically includes adult men who are tall or shorter and adult women who tall or shorter. By comparison, the median or typical adult height in these populations (as the widely abundant statistics from these countries clearly state) is about for men and for women.\n\nShortness in children and young adults nearly always results from below-average growth in childhood, while shortness in older adults usually results from loss of height due to kyphosis of the spine or collapsed vertebrae from osteoporosis. The most common causes of short stature in childhood are constitutional growth delay or familial short stature. \n\nFrom a medical perspective, severe shortness can be a variation of normal, resulting from the interplay of multiple familial genes. It can also be due to one or more of many abnormal conditions, such as chronic (prolonged) growth hormone or thyroid hormone deficiency, malnutrition, disease of a major organ system, mistreatment, treatment with certain drugs, chromosomal deletions. Human growth hormone (HGH) deficiency may occur at any time during infancy or childhood, with the most obvious sign being a noticeable slowing of growth. The deficiency may be genetic. Among children without growth hormone deficiency, short stature may be caused by Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome, chronic kidney disease, being small for gestational age at birth, Prader–Willi syndrome, Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, or other conditions. Genetic skeletal dysplasias also known as osteochondrodysplasia usually manifest in short-limbed disproportionate short stature.\n\nWhen the cause is unknown, it is called \"idiopathic short stature\".\nShort stature can also be caused by the bone plates fusing at an earlier age than normal, therefore stunting growth. Normally, the bone age is the same as the biological age but for some people, it is older. For many people with advanced bone ages, they hit a growth spurt early on which propels them to average height but stop growing at an earlier age. However, in some cases, people who are naturally shorter combined with their advanced bone age, end up being even shorter than the height they normally would have been because of their stunted growth.\n\nChronic illnesses, malnutrition, endocrine, metabolic disorders or chromosomal anomalies are characterized by proportionate short stature. \nOn the other hand, most genetic skeletal dysplasias are known for short stature that may be proportionate or disproportionate. Disproportionate short stature can be further subdivided as specified by the body segments affected by shortening, namely limbs versus trunk:\nShort-limb short stature can be further subcategorised in accordance with limb segment affected by shortening. These subcategories of limb shortening include, rhizomelic (humerus and femur), mesomelic (radius, ulna, tibia and fibula) and acromelic (hands and feet). Anthropometric measurements provide are very beneficial tools to the diagnostic process of genetic skeletal dysplasias. The anthropometric measurements include height, sitting height, arm span, upper/ lower-body segment ratio, sitting height/height ratio, and arm span/height ratio for age. They also aid in the differential diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia subtypes.\n\nThe decision to treat is based on a belief that the child will be disabled by being extremely short as an adult, so that the risks of treatment (including sudden death) will outweigh the risks of not treating the symptom of short stature. Although short children commonly report being teased about their height, most adults who are very short are not physically or psychologically disabled by their height. However, there is some evidence to suggest that there is an inverse linear relationship with height and with risk of suicide.\n\nTreatment is expensive and requires many years of injections with human growth hormones. The result depends on the cause, but is typically an increase in final height of about taller than predicted. Thus, treatment takes a child who is expected to be much shorter than a typical adult and produces an adult who is still obviously shorter than average. For example, several years of successful treatment in a girl who is predicted to be as an adult may result in her being instead.\n\nIncreasing final height in children with short stature may be beneficial and could enhance health-related quality of life outcomes, barring troublesome side effects and excessive cost of treatments.\n\nThe cost of treatment depends on the amount of growth hormone given, which in turn depends on the child's weight and age. One year's worth of drugs normally costs about US$20,000 for a small child and over $50,000 for a teenager. These drugs are normally taken for five or more years.\n\nFrom a social perspective shortness can be a problem independently of the cause. In many societies there are advantages associated with taller stature and disadvantages associated with shorter stature, and vice versa.\n\nPharmaceutical companies Genentech and Eli Lilly, makers of human growth hormone, have worked to medicalize short stature by convincing the public that short stature is a disease rather than a natural variation in human height. Limiting sales of the hormone to children diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, rather than being short for any reason, limited their sales market. Expanding it to all children whose height was below the third percentile would create 90,000 new customers and US$10 billion in revenue. In the early 1990s, they paid two US charities, the Human Growth Foundation and the MAGIC Foundation, to measure the height of thousands of American children in schools and public places, and to send letters urging medical consultations for children whose height was deemed low. Parents and schools were not told that the charities were being paid by the drug companies to do this.\n\nPaired with a campaign to advertise the hormone to physicians, the campaign was successful, and tens of thousands of children began receiving HGH. About half of them do not have growth hormone deficiency, and consequently benefited very little, if at all, from the hormone injections. Criticism of the universal screening program eventually resulted in its end.\n\nShort stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency.\n\nDuring World War I in Britain, the minimum height for soldiers was . Thus thousands of men under this height were denied the ability to fight in the war. As a result of pressure to allow them entry, special \"Bantam Battalions\" were created composed of men who were to . By the end of the war there were 29 Bantam Battalions of about 1,000 men each. Officers were of normal size.\n\n"}

They cluster under different groupings and the whole is sometimes referred to as \"green capitalism\". Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and human rights policies. In general, business is described as green if it matches the following four criteria:\n\nA sustainable business is any organization that participates in environmentally friendly or green activities to ensure that all processes, products, and manufacturing activities adequately address current environmental concerns while maintaining a profit. In other words, it is a business that “meets the needs of the present [world] without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” It is the process of assessing how to design products that will take advantage of the current environmental situation and how well a company’s products perform with renewable resources.\n\nThe Brundtland Report emphasized that sustainability is a three-legged stool of people, planet, and profit. Sustainable businesses with the supply chain try to balance all three through the triple-bottom-line concept—using sustainable development and sustainable distribution to affect the environment, business growth, and the society.\n\nEveryone affects the sustainability of the marketplace and the planet in some way. Sustainable development within a business can create value for customers, investors, and the environment. A sustainable business must meet customer needs while, at the same time, treating the environment well. To succeed in such an approach, where stakeholder balancing and joint solutions are key, requires a structural approach. One philosophy, that include many different tools and methods, is the concept of Sustainable Enterprise Excellence. Another is the adoption of the concept of responsible growth.\n\nSustainability is often confused with corporate social responsibility (CSR), though the two are not the same. Bansal and DesJardine (2014) state that the notion of ‘time’ discriminates sustainability from CSR and other similar concepts. Whereas ethics, morality, and norms permeate CSR, sustainability only obliges businesses to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. Short-termism is the bane of sustainability.\n\nGreen business has been seen as a possible mediator of economic-environmental relations, and if proliferated, would serve to diversify our economy, even if it has a negligible effect at lowering atmospheric CO levels. The definition of \"green jobs\" is ambiguous, but it is generally agreed that these jobs, the result of green business, should be linked to clean energy, and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases. These corporations can be seen as generators of not only \"green energy\", but as producers of new \"materialities\" that are the product of the technologies these firms developed and deployed.\n\nA major initiative of sustainable businesses is to eliminate or decrease the environmental harm caused by the production and consumption of their goods. The impact of such human activities in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases produced can be measured in units of carbon dioxide and is referred to as the \"carbon footprint\". The carbon footprint concept is derived from ecological footprint analysis, which examines the ecological capacity required to support the consumption of products.\n\nBusinesses take a wide range of green initiatives. One of the most common examples is the act of \"going paperless\" or sending electronic correspondence in lieu of paper when possible. On a higher level, examples of sustainable business practices include: \"refurbishing used products\" (e.g., tuning up lightly used commercial fitness equipment for resale); \"revising production processes\" to eliminate waste (such as using a more accurate template to cut out designs); and choosing nontoxic raw materials and processes. For example, Canadian farmers have found that hemp is a sustainable alternative to rapeseed in their traditional crop rotation; hemp grown for fiber or seed requires no pesticides or herbicides.\n\nSustainable business leaders also take into account the \"life cycle costs\" for the items they produce. Input costs must be considered in regards to regulations, energy use, storage, and disposal. \"Designing for the environment\" (DFE) is also an element of sustainable business. This process enables users to consider the potential environmental impacts of a product and the process used to make that product.\n\nThe many possibilities for adopting green practices have led to considerable pressure being put upon companies from consumers, employees, government regulators and other stakeholders. Some companies have resorted to greenwashing instead of making meaningful changes, merely marketing their products in ways that suggest green practices. For example, various producers in the bamboo fiber industry have been taken to court for advertising their products as more \"green\" than they are. Still, countless other companies have taken the sustainability trend seriously and are enjoying profits. In their book “Corporate Sustainability in International Comparison”, Schaltegger et al. (2014) analyse the current state of corporate sustainability management and corporate social responsibility across eleven countries. Their research is based on an extensive survey focusing on the companies’ intention to pursue sustainability management (i.e. motivation; issues), the integration of sustainability in the organisation (i.e. connecting sustainability to the core business; involving corporate functions; using drivers of business cases for sustainability) and the actual implementation of sustainability management measures (i.e. stakeholder management; sustainability management tools and standards; measurements). The \"Gort Cloud\" written by Richard Seireeni, (2009), documents the experiences of sustainable businesses in America and their reliance on the vast but invisible green community, referred to as the gort cloud, for support and a market.\n\nGreen investment firms are consequently attracting unprecedented interest. In the UK, for instance, the Green Investment Bank is devoted exclusively to supporting renewable domestic energy. However, the UK and Europe as a whole are falling behind the impressive pace set by developing nations in terms of green development. Thus, green investment firms are creating more and more opportunities to support sustainable development practices in emerging economies. By providing micro-loans and larger investments, these firms assist small business owners in developing nations who seek business education, affordable loans, and new distribution networks for their \"green\" products.\n\nThe Harvard Business School business historian Geoffrey Jones (academic) has traced the historical origins of green business back to pioneering start-ups in organic food and wind and solar energy before World War 1. Among large corporations, Ford Motor Company occupies an odd role in the story of sustainability. Ironically, founder Henry Ford was a pioneer in the sustainable business realm, experimenting with plant-based fuels during the days of the Model T. Ford Motor Company also shipped the Model A truck in crates that then became the vehicle floorboards at the factory destination. This was a form of \"upcycling\", retaining high quality in a closed-loop industrial cycle. Furthermore, the original auto body was made of a stronger-than-steel hemp composite. Today, of course, Fords aren't made of hemp nor do they run on the most sensible fuel. Currently, Ford's claim to eco-friendly fame is the use of seat fabric made from 100% post-industrial materials and renewable soy foam seat bases. Ford executives recently appointed the company’s first senior vice president of sustainability, environment, and safety engineering. This position is responsible for establishing a long-range sustainability strategy and environmental policy. The person in this position will also help develop the products and processes necessary to satisfy both customers and society as a whole while working toward energy independence. It remains to be seen whether Ford will return to its founder's vision of a petroleum-free automobile, a vehicle powered by the remains of plant matter.\n\nThe automobile manufacturer Subaru is a sustainability giant. In 2008 a Subaru assembly plant in Lafayette became the first auto manufacturer to achieve zero land fill status when the plant implemented sustainable policies. The company successfully managed to implement a plan that increased refuse recycling to 99.8%. In 2012, the corporation increased the reuse of Styrofoam by 9%. And from the year 2008 to the year 2012, environmental incidents and accidents reduced from 18 to 4.\n\nSmaller companies such as Nature's Path, an organic cereal and snack making business, have also made significant sustainability gains in the 21st century. CEO Arran Stephens and his associates have ensured that the quickly growing company's products are produced without toxic farm chemicals. Furthermore, employees are constantly encouraged to find ways to reduce consumption. Sustainability is an essential part of corporate discussions. Another example comes from Salt Spring Coffee, a company created in 1996 as a certified organic, fair trade, coffee producer. In recent years they have become carbon neutral, lowering emissions by reducing long-range trucking and using bio-diesel in delivery trucks, upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing carbon offsets. The company claims to offer the first carbon neutral coffee sold in Canada. Salt Spring Coffee was recognized by the David Suzuki Foundation in the 2010 report \"Doing Business in a New Climate\". A third example comes from Korea, where rice husks are used as a nontoxic packaging for stereo components and other electronics. The same material is later recycled to make bricks.\n\nThe mining and specifically gold mining industries are also moving towards more sustainable practices, especially given that the industry is one of the most environmentally destructive. Indeed, regarding gold mining, Northwestern University scientists have, in the laboratory, discovered an inexpensive and environmentally sustainable method that uses simple cornstarch—instead of cyanide—to isolate gold from raw materials in a selective manner. Such a method will reduce the amount of cyanide released into the environment during gold extraction from raw ore, with one of the Northwestern University scientists, Sir Fraser Stoddart stating that: “The elimination of cyanide from the gold industry is of the utmost importance environmentally\". Additionally, the retail jewelry industry is now trying to be totally sustainable, with companies using green energy providers and recycling more, as well as preventing the use of mined-so called 'virgin gold' by applying re-finishing methods on pieces and re-selling them. Furthermore, the customer may opt for Fairtrade Gold, which gives a better deal to small scale and artisanal miners, and is an element of sustainable business. However, not all think that mining can be sustainable and much more must be done, noting that mining in general is in need of greater regional and international legislation and regulation, which is a valid point given the huge impact mining has on the planet and the huge number of products and goods that are made wholly or partly from mined materials.\n\nOrganizations that give back to the community, whether through employees volunteering their time or through charitable donations are often considered socially sustainable. Organizations also can encourage education in their communities by training their employees and offering internships to younger members of the community. Practices such as these increase the education level and quality of life in the community.\n\nFor a business to be truly sustainable, it must sustain not only the necessary environmental resources, but also social resources—including employees, customers (the community), and its reputation.\n\nThe European community’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive restricts the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of various electronic and electrical products. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directives provide collection, recycling, and recovery practices for electrical goods. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute are two organizations working together to set a standard for reporting on corporate carbon footprints. From October 2013, all quoted companies in the UK are legally required to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions in their directors’ report, under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.\n\nLester Brown’s Plan B 2.0 and Hunter Lovins’s Natural Capitalism provide information on sustainability initiatives.\n\nCorporate sustainability strategies can aim to take advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities, while protecting the value of business against increasing energy costs, the costs of meeting regulatory requirements, changes in the way customers perceive brands and products, and the volatile price of resources.\n\nNot all eco-strategies can be incorporated into a company's Eco-portfolio immediately. The widely practiced strategies include: Innovation, Collaboration, Process Improvement and Sustainability reporting. \nThis introverted method of sustainable corporate practices focuses on a company's ability to change its products and services towards less waste production and sustainable best practices.\n\nThe formation of networks with similar or partner companies facilitates knowledge sharing and propels innovation.\n\nContinuous process surveying and improvement is essential to reduction in waste. Employee awareness of company-wide sustainability plan further aids the integration of new and improved processes.\n\nPeriodic reporting of company performance in relation to goals. These goals are often incorporated into the corporate mission (as in the case of Ford Motor Co.).\n\nSustainable procurement is important for any sustainability strategy as a company's impact on the environment is much bigger than the products that they consume. The B Corporation (certification) model is a good example of one that encourages companies to focus on this.\n\nAdditionally, companies might consider implementing a sound measurement and management system with readjustment procedures, as well as a regular forum for all stakeholders to discuss sustainablity issues. The Sustainability Balanced Scorecard is a performance measurement and management system aiming at balancing financial and non-financial as well as short and long-term measures. It explicitly integrates strategically relevant environmental, social and ethical goals into the overall performance management system and supports strategic sustainability management.\n\nEnormous economic and population growth worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century aggravated the factors that threaten health and the world — ozone depletion, climate change, depletion, fouling of natural resources, and extensive loss of biodiversity and habitat. In the past, the standard approaches to environmental problems generated by business and industry have been regulatory-driven \"end-of-the-pipe\" remediation efforts. In the 1990s, efforts by governments, NGOs, corporations, and investors began to grow substantially to develop awareness and plans for investment in business sustainability.\n\nOne critical milestone was the establishment of the ISO 14000 standards whose development came as a result of the Rio Summit on the Environment held in 1992. ISO 14001 is the cornerstone standard of the ISO 14000 series. It specifies a framework of control for an Environmental Management System against which an organization can be certified by a third party. Other ISO 14000 Series Standards are actually guidelines, many to help you achieve registration to ISO 14001. They include the following:\n\nWhile the initial focus of academic, industry, and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of re-X (recycling, remanufacturing, reuse...) technology, it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation. To leverage this technology for the transition towards a Circular Economy, different stakeholders have to work together. This shifted attention towards business model innovation as a key leverage for 'circular' technology adaption.\n\nCircular business models are business models that are closing, narrowing, slowing, intensifying, and dematerialising loops, to minimise the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organisational system. This comprises recycling measures (closing), efficiency improvements (narrowing), use phase extensions (slowing or extending), a more intense use phase (intensifying), and the substitution of product utility by service and software solutions (dematerialising).\n\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards were developed by the US Green Building Council in an effort to propel green building design in the United States. LEED certification is very prestigious title and can be attained through \"compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, occupancy scenarios, building permanence and pre-rating completion, site boundaries and area-to-site ratios, and obligatory five-year sharing of whole building energy and water use data from the start of occupancy (for new construction) or date of certification (for existing buildings)\".[15].\n\nImplementing sustainable business practices may have an effect on profits and a firm's financial 'bottom line'. At first blush, this challenge might make many corporate executives cringe. However, during a time where environmental awareness is popular, green strategies are likely to be embraced by employees, consumers, and other stakeholders. In fact, according to many studies, a positive correlation exists between environmental performance and economic performance.\n\nIf an organisation’s current business model is inherently unsustainable, becoming a truly sustainable business requires a complete makeover of the business model (e.g. from selling cars to offering car sharing and other mobility services). This can present a major challenge due to the differences between the old and the new model and the respective skills, resources and infrastructure needed. A new business model can also offer major opportunities by entering or even creating new markets and reaching new customer groups.\n\nCompanies leading the way in sustainable business practices can be said to be taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015, and the average internal rate of return on energy efficiency investments for large businesses is 48%. A 2013 survey suggests that demand for green products appears to be increasing: 27% of respondents said they are more likely to buy a sustainable product and/or service than 5 years ago. Furthermore, sustainable business practices may attract talent and generate tax breaks.\n\n"}
{"id": "2237840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237840", "title": "Decoded Feedback", "text": "Decoded Feedback\n\nDecoded Feedback is a Canadian musical project which incorporates styles of electro-industrial and aggrotech. The duo currently releases music on the North American distributor Metropolis Records, and the European record label Out of Line.\n\nDecoded Feedback was formed in 1993 by the Italian Marco Biagiotti and the Hungarian Yone Dudas (both live in Canada). After the release of their \"Decoded Feedback\" demo tape and a subsequent review by the Belgian industrial music magazine \"Sideline\", they were signed to the European label, Hard Records, which released their first full-length CD, \"Overdosing\", and gained the attention of another European record label, Zoth Ommog. The latter released Decoded Feedback's second disc, \"Technophoby\", in 1997. This attracted the attention of the American industrial music distributors Metropolis Records, who released domestic versions of all subsequent Decoded Feedback releases. \"Bio-Vital\", released in 1998, was the first Decoded Feedback album to enter the German Alternative Charts (DAC). In the same year, they released a second album with new tracks and remixes called \"Evolution\".\nIn 2000, Biagiotti and Dudas signed to the record label Bloodline to release \"Mechanical Horizon\", which was preceded by the first ever Decoded Feedback single, \"Reflect in Silence\". Three years later, Decoded Feedback switched to their current record label, Out of Line, and released \"Shockwave\", which again was preceded by a single, \"Phoenix\". In 2005, they released \"Combustion\" as well as the soundtrack for the Cindy Murdoch's short zombie film, \"Red Men Rising\". \"Aftermath\" was released in 2010 and \"disKonnekt\" in 2012.\n\nDecoded Feedback have played several live shows in Europe. The band spent the greater part of 2001 touring with Noisex and Sonar and again in 2003 with Haujobb. They have played the M'era Luna Festival, the Blacksun Festival in the USA, Infest 2005, and the Out of Line Festival, as well as touring with fellow Metropolis Records bands God Module and Blutengel. In Toronto, Canada, at the EBM Fest 2008, they played as a DJ set because the singer was not present.\n\nBiagiotti and Dudas originally experimented with the fusion of punk and electro, but over time developed a more cold, industrial-oriented sound. By the time \"Evolution\" was released, they had attempted to create a blend of industrial and electronic body music, with \"interwoven dance floor textures and symphonic melodies\". This sound culminated with \"Mechanical Horizon\", but turned sharply with \"Shockwave\", an album that was seen as something of a return to an older style. \"Combustion\" continued this trend.\n\nBoth members have also cited the tensions that exist between sexes and international boundaries, as well as their unique backgrounds, as a driving force behind their music - especially in an attempt to create their own unique style. Decoded Feedback's music is popular within the darker electronic music scene, especially among fans of electro-industrial music. Comparable artists include fellow Metropolis Records acts Haujobb, Wumpscut, Suicide Commando and Front Line Assembly, as well as Zoth Ommog acts X Marks the Pedwalk and Evil's Toy.\n\n\n\nThe above soundtracks have not been released in any format other than in the movies themselves. \"Hyberia\" is a short 3 minute film by Francist (who directed the music videos for the Decoded Feedback songs \"Phoenix\" and \"Hyberia\", the latter of which uses audio elements from the soundtrack). \"Red Men Rising\" is a 15 minute film about zombies, the soundtrack to which was done by Yone Dudas.\n\n"}

The cartridge is intended for large and dangerous game. \n\nIt is a beltless, rebated rim cartridge created by necking up the .300 Remington Ultra Magnum case to .375 caliber with no other changes. Factory loadings are less powerful than handloads for the cartridge. Remington factory loads push a 300 grain (19 g) bullet at 2760 ft/s (840 m/s), producing 5070 ft·lbf (6.88 kJ) of energy. A handloader can increase the muzzle velocity of a 220gr bullet to 3321 ft/s (900 m/s), and develop 5800 ft·lbf (7.9 kJ).\n\nThe intended use of this cartridge includes hunting large, thick-skinned game. It is powerful enough to kill any land animal and, with its high velocity, can do so at fairly long ranges. Such performance comes at the price of a heavy recoil: in a sporting-weight rifle of ~8 lb (3.6 kg), this cartridge can produce a fierce 80 ft·lbf (108 J) of recoil (approximately 3.5 times that of a .30-06.)\n\nThere is a wide selection of .375 in (9.53 mm) bullets available that are suited to the high velocities of the .375 RUM, and boat tail bullets help to further extend the useful range.\n\nCurrently, there are no production rifles in this chambering\n(Savage & Remington previously did so.) Remington, DoubleTap and Nosler are the only sources of factory ammunition. Loading dies and reloading data are readily available to the handloader.

{"id": "2237848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237848", "title": "Denver Civic Center", "text": "Denver Civic Center\n\nThe Denver Civic Center is a civic center area that includes two parks surrounded by government and cultural buildings and spaces. Civic Center is located in central Denver, Colorado, on the south side of Downtown Denver. Much of the area is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (boundaries clarified 1988). A somewhat smaller area was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2012 as one of the nation's finest examples of the City Beautiful movement of civic design. Denver Civic Center lies partially within the north end of an official Denver neighborhood also named Civic Center. It includes the Colorado State Capitol building, in the west end of Denver's official Capitol Hill neighborhood, and it includes a few buildings in the south end of Denver's Central Business District.\n\nThe Civic Center area is known as the center of the civic life in the city, with numerous institutions of arts, government, and culture as well as festivals, parades, and protests throughout the year.\n\nCivic Center Park is part of the City and County of Denver park system, located at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway, perhaps the best-known and most important streets in Denver. The park is bordered by Bannock Street on the west, Broadway on the east, Colfax Avenue on the north, and 14th Avenue on the south. The park is home to a fountain, several statues, and formal gardens, and includes a Greek amphitheater, a war memorial, and the Voorhies Memorial Seal Pond. It is well known for its symmetrical Neoclassical design. Lincoln Park, immediately east of Civic Center Park, is operated by the State of Colorado. It holds a replica of the Liberty Bell and several memorials.\n\nCivic Center was an idea that originated with former Denver mayor Robert W. Speer. In 1904, Speer proposed a series of civic improvements based on the City Beautiful Ideas shown to him at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\nSpeer hired Charles Mulford Robinson among others to develop plans for the area. Robinson proposed extending 16th Street to the Colorado State Capitol and to group other municipal buildings around a central park area. Such a plan was expensive however. Voter approval was necessary to acquire the funds, but the measure was defeated in a 1906 election.\n\nUndaunted, Speer gathered business leaders who brought in new ideas for the Civic Center including the creation of an east-west axial between the Colorado State Capitol, and swinging the north and south borders of the park into the city grid system.\n\nThese plans were stalled when in 1912, Speer was replaced as mayor. The new mayor brought in Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. who was developing plans for Denver's mountain parks. His ideas included an informal grove of trees on the eastern edge of the park, and a lighted concert area.\n\nWhen Speer was reelected in 1916, he went against Olmsted's designs. Speer instead hired Chicago planner and architect Edward H. Bennett, a protégé of Daniel Burnham. Bennett combined the ideas of all of the previous plans, adding the Greek amphitheater, the Colonnade, the seal pond, and the realignment of Colfax Avenue and 14th Ave., around the park. The park officially opened in 1919. The City and County Building was finished in 1932.\n\nCivic Center has long been the government, arts, history, and learning nexus of both the state of Colorado and the Denver Metropolitan Area.\nAmong the institutions in the Civic Center are Denver Art Museum and the Denver Central Library along the park's south side, the Colorado State Capitol and the City and County Building of Denver along the east and west axis of the park, the Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building on the park's north side, and the History Colorado Center and the Colorado State Judicial Building to the southeast of the park. The Denver Mint lies immediately west of the Civic Center Park across the street from the City and County Building.\n\nThe area has seen a new civic development, including the Denver Newspaper Agency (northeast of the park), the home of \"The Denver Post\". Voters in 2004 approved a new Denver Justice Center, two blocks away from Civic Center Park. This project was completed in 2010.\n\nCivic Center is known throughout the state as the rendezvous for the largest and most important cultural and civic events. Being at the center of the state and local government institutions, Civic Center has become the place for political statement for various groups and individuals representing a variety of causes. In 1990 and 1991, the Civic Center was the location of the CART Grand Prix of Denver.\n\nIt was Civic Center where the public held a vigil for the victims of Columbine High School massacre, and 9/11. Former presidential candidate and Denver native John Kerry made a 2004 campaign stop at Civic Center, and 2008 Democratic nominee Barack Obama gave a speech there on October 26, 2008 to an estimated 100,000 supporters.\nOn October 11, 2019, a School strike for climate protest was held in Civic Center Park with Greta Thunberg.\n\nCivic Center is also the location for many annual events. These include:\n\n\n"}

She is best known as the showrunner—creator, head writer, and executive producer—of the television medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\", its spin-off \"Private Practice\", and the political thriller series \"Scandal\". Rhimes has also served as the executive producer of the ABC television series \"Off the Map\", \"How to Get Away with Murder\", \"The Catch\", and \"Station 19\".\n\nIn 2007, Rhimes was named one of \"TIME\" magazine's 100 People Who Help Shape the World. In 2015, she published her first book, a memoir, \"Year of Yes: How to Dance It Out, Stand in the Sun, and Be Your Own Person\". In 2017, Netflix said that it had entered into a multi-year development deal with Rhimes, by which all of her future productions will be Netflix Original series. Netflix had already purchased the streaming rights to back episodes of \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal\".\n\nRhimes was born in Chicago, Illinois, as the youngest of six children of Vera P. (Cain), a college professor, and Ilee Rhimes, Jr., a university administrator. Her mother attended college while raising their six children and earned a PhD in educational administration in 1991. Her father, who holds an MBA, became chief information officer (CIO) at the University of Southern California, serving until 2013.\n\nRhimes lived in Park Forest South (now University Park, Illinois), with her two older brothers and three older sisters. She has said she exhibited an early affinity for storytelling. While in high school, she served as a hospital volunteer, which inspired an interest in hospital environments.\n\nRhimes attended Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois. At Dartmouth College, she majored in English and film studies and earned her bachelor's degree in 1991. At Dartmouth, she joined the Black Underground Theater Association. She divided her time between directing and performing in student productions, and writing fiction.\n\nShe also wrote for the college newspaper. After college, she relocated to San Francisco with an older sibling and worked in advertising at McCann Erickson. She subsequently moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California and study screenwriting. Ranked at the top of her USC class, Rhimes earned the Gary Rosenberg Writing Fellowship. She obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree from the USC School of Cinematic Arts.\n\nWhile at USC, Rhimes was hired as an intern by Debra Martin Chase. Rhimes credits her early success, in part, to mentors such as this prominent African-American producer, and she worked at Denzel Washington's company, Mundy Lane Entertainment. Chase served as a mentor to Rhimes: they worked together on \"The Princess Diaries 2\".\n\nRhimes adopted her first daughter in June 2002 and adopted another girl in February 2012. In September 2013, Rhimes welcomed her third daughter via gestational surrogacy.\n\nIn 2014, Rhimes gave a commencement address at her alma mater, Dartmouth College, where she received an honorary doctorate.\n\nIn September 2015, Rhimes revealed she had lost 117 pounds via exercise and dieting.\n\nAfter graduation, Rhimes was an unemployed scriptwriter in Hollywood. To make ends meet, Rhimes worked at a variety of day jobs, including as an office administrator, and then a counselor at a job center that taught job skills to mentally ill and homeless people. During this period, Rhimes worked as research director on the documentary, \"\" (1995), which won the 1995 Peabody Award. In 1998 Rhimes made a short film, \"Blossoms and Veils\", starring Jada Pinkett-Smith and Jeffrey Wright, which is her only credit as a film director. New Line Cinema purchased a feature script of hers. Rhimes received an assignment to co-write the HBO movie \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\" (1999). It earned numerous awards for its star, Halle Berry.\n\nIn 2001, Rhimes wrote \"Crossroads\", the debut film of pop singer Britney Spears. Despite being panned by critics, the film grossed more than $60 million worldwide.\n\nRhimes next worked on writing Disney's sequel to its popular movie, \"The Princess Diaries\" (2001). Although \"\" (2004) did not score as well at the box office, Rhimes later said that she treasured the experience, if only for the opportunity to work with its star, Julie Andrews. In 2003, Rhimes wrote her first TV pilot for ABC, about young female war correspondents, but the network turned it down.\n\nRhimes is the creator and currently executive producer and head writer of \"Grey's Anatomy\". The series debuted as a mid-season replacement on March 27, 2005. The series features the surgical staff at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later to be named Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital), in Seattle, Washington. The series features an ensemble cast with Ellen Pompeo serving as titular character Meredith Grey, who provides narration for a majority of the series' episodes. On May 16, 2006, ABC announced plans to relocate \"Grey's Anatomy\" from Sunday evenings to Thursdays to anchor the network's Thursday evening programming, by airing Thursdays at 9 p.m. As of 2020, the series continues.\n\nIn 2007, Rhimes created and produced the \"Grey's Anatomy\" spin-off series \"Private Practice\", which debuted September 26, 2007, on ABC. The show chronicled the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) as she left Seattle Grace Hospital for Los Angeles to join a private practice. The series also featured an ensemble cast, including Tim Daly, Amy Brenneman, Audra McDonald and Taye Diggs among others. The first season was shortened because of a writers' strike; it has nine episodes. In May 2012, ABC picked up \"Private Practice\" for the 2012–13 television season with 13 episodes. The series finale was aired January 22, 2013.\n\nIn 2010, Rhimes created a new pilot for ABC called \"Inside the Box\", a female-centric ensemble drama set in a Washington, D.C. network news bureau. The lead character was Catherine, an ambitious female news producer who, with her colleagues, pursued \"the story\" at all costs while juggling their personal animosities and crises of conscience. It was not picked up by the network.\n\nIn 2011, Rhimes served as executive producer for the medical drama, \"Off the Map\", which was created by \"Grey's Anatomy\" writer, Jenna Bans. It focused on a group of doctors who practice medicine at a remote clinic in the Amazon jungle. The series was officially cancelled by the ABC network on May 13, 2011.\n\nIn May 2011, ABC ordered Rhimes' pilot script \"Scandal\" to series. Kerry Washington stars as Olivia Pope, a political crisis management expert. The character is partially based on former Bush administration press aide Judy Smith. The series debut aired on April 5, 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Rhimes developed a pilot for a period drama, \"Gilded Lilys\", but it was not picked up to series.\n\nIn December 2013, ABC ordered a pilot for a new Rhimes series, \"How to Get Away with Murder\". Actress Viola Davis joined the cast as the lead character in February 2014. It was officially picked up to series on May 8, 2014.\n\nIn March 2016, ABC premiered \"The Catch\", a comedy-drama led by Rhimes based on a treatment by British author Kate Atkinson. It starred Mireille Enos and Peter Krause. Later that month, \"Scandal\", \"How to Get Away with Murder\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" were respectively picked up for their sixth, third and 13th seasons. The following year, it was announced that \"Scandal\" would conclude after its upcoming seventh season, while \"The Catch\" was cancelled after its second.\n\nOn August 14, 2017, Netflix announced that it had entered into an exclusive multi-year development deal with Rhimes, under which all of her future productions will be Netflix Original series. The service already had purchased U.S. streaming rights to past episodes of \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal\". Chief content officer Ted Sarandos described Rhimes as being a \"true Netflixer at heart\", since \"she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience\".\n\nOf the deal, Rhimes said that\n\n[Sarandos] understood what I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix's singular sense of innovation. The future of Shondaland at Netflix has limitless possibilities.\n\nThe deal was considered to be a coup for Netflix due to Rhimes' prominence at ABC; it was also considered to be a counter toward the effort by Disney, ABC's parent company, to reduce the availability of their content on Netflix in favor of a planned subscription streaming service of their own.\n\nIn June 2018, Netflix announced that the first project under the deal will be an adaptation of the \"New York\" magazine story \"How Anna Delvey Tricked New York's Party People\", originally written by Jessica Pressler based on the real-life story of the controversial society fraud Anna Delvey.\n\nShondaland is the name of Rhimes's production company. Shondaland and its logo also refer to the shows Rhimes has produced and to Rhimes herself. Shows included in Shondaland are:\n\nShonda Rhimes has won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for three Emmy Awards. She has also won awards from the Writer's Guild of America, Producer's Guild of America, and Director's Guild of America. Below is a more complete list.\n\n"}

Categories with all finite products and exponential objects are called cartesian closed categories. Categories (such as subcategories of Top) without adjoined products may still have an exponential law.\n\nLet formula_1 be a category, let formula_2 and formula_3 be objects of formula_1, and let formula_1 have all binary products with formula_3. An object formula_7 together with a morphism formula_8 is an \"exponential object\" if for any object formula_9 and morphism formula_10 there is a unique morphism formula_11 (called the \"transpose\" of formula_12) such that the following diagram commutes:\n\nThis assignment of a unique formula_13 to each formula_12 establishes an isomorphism of hom-sets, formula_15\n\nIf formula_7exists for all objects formula_17 in formula_1, then the functor formula_19 defined on objects by formula_20 and on arrows by formula_21, is a right adjoint to the product functor formula_22. For this reason, the morphisms formula_13 and formula_12 are sometimes called \"exponential adjoints\" of one another.\n\nAlternatively, the exponential object may be defined through equations:\n\nThe exponential formula_30 is given by a universal morphism from the product functor formula_22 to the object formula_2. This universal morphism consists of an object formula_30 and a morphism formula_8.\n\nIn the category of sets, an exponential object formula_30 is the set of all functions formula_36. The map formula_37 is just the evaluation map, which sends the pair formula_38 to formula_39. For any map formula_40 the map formula_41 is the curried form of formula_12:\n\nA Heyting algebra formula_44 is just a bounded lattice that has all exponential objects. Heyting implication, formula_45, is an alternative notation for formula_30. The above adjunction results translate to implication (formula_47) being right adjoint to meet (formula_48). This adjunction can be written as formula_49, or more fully as:\nformula_50\n\nIn the category of topological spaces, the exponential object formula_30 exists provided that formula_3 is a locally compact Hausdorff space. In that case, the space formula_30 is the set of all continuous functions from formula_3 to formula_2 together with the compact-open topology. The evaluation map is the same as in the category of sets; it is continuous with the above topology. If formula_3 is not locally compact Hausdorff, the exponential object may not exist (the space formula_30 still exists, but it may fail to be an exponential object since the evaluation function need not be continuous). For this reason the category of topological spaces fails to be cartesian closed.\nHowever, the category of locally compact topological spaces is not cartesian closed either, since formula_30 need not be locally compact for locally compact spaces formula_2 and formula_3. A cartesian closed category of spaces is, for example, given by the full subcategory spanned by the compactly generated Hausdorff spaces.\n\nIn functional programming languages, the morphism formula_61 is often called formula_62, and the syntax formula_13 is often written formula_64. The morphism formula_61 here must not to be confused with the eval function in some programming languages, which evaluates quoted expressions.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the bassist for the American rock band Fall Out Boy, since 2001. Before Fall Out Boy, Wentz was a fixture of the Chicago hardcore scene and was the lead singer and songwriter for Arma Angelus, a metalcore band. During Fall Out Boy's hiatus from 2009 to 2012, Wentz formed the experimental, electropop and dubstep group Black Cards. He owns a record label, DCD2 Records, which has signed bands including Panic! at the Disco and Gym Class Heroes.\n\nFall Out Boy returned from hiatus in February 2013, and have since released 3 number-one albums; \"Save Rock and Roll\", \"American Beauty/American Psycho\", and \"Mania\".\n\nWentz has also ventured into other non-musical projects, including writing, acting, and fashion; in 2005 he founded a clothing company called Clandestine Industries. He also hosts the TV show \"Best Ink\" and runs a film production company called Bartskull Films, as well as a bar called Angels & Kings. His philanthropic activities include collaborations with Invisible Children, Inc. and UNICEF's Tap Project, a fundraising project that helps bring clean drinking water to people worldwide, \"People\" magazine states that \"no bassist has upstaged a frontman as well as Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy.\" He is also a minority owner of the Phoenix Rising FC, a USL Championship team.\n\nPeter Lewis Kingston Wentz III was born in Wilmette, Illinois, an affluent suburb of Chicago. His parents are Dale (née Lewis), a high school admissions counselor, and Pete Wentz II, an attorney. Wentz is of English and German descent on his father's side and Afro-Jamaican descent on his mother's side. He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. His maternal grandfather, Arthur Winston Lewis, served as the U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone; Arthur Winston Lewis' cousin is General Colin Powell.\n\nWentz' parents met while campaigning for former Vice President Joe Biden's senatorial run in the 1970s. Wentz recalled in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview that his earliest musical memory was listening to The Foundations' song \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" in the back of his father's car. Wentz attended New Trier High School and North Shore Country Day School, where he was an all-state soccer player. He considered pursuing a professional career in the sport, but decided that music was a more fulfilling choice; he says that he \"always had a magical connection to the ball. But it didn't feel like an adventure. Music was more of a challenge and, in the end, felt more interesting.\"\n\nDuring his first year of high school, he began skipping school regularly and smoking marijuana with friends, but later quit as it was affecting his grades at school. After graduating from high school in 1997, he attended DePaul University, where he studied political science, dropping out one quarter shy of graduation to focus on Fall Out Boy.\n\nWentz was primarily involved in the Chicago hardcore punk scene and was in several bands in the late 1990s. He formed his first band First Born in 1993. By the mid-1990s, he became an infrequent bass player for Racetraitor.\n\nWentz formed the metalcore band Novena (later renamed to Arma Angelus) soon after, along with Adam Bishop of XshroudX and Extinction; Daniel Binaei of Racetraitor; and Timothy Miller. The band cycled through six bassists before recruiting Tim McIlrath, who had recently departed from Baxter. They released their debut EP \"the Grave End of the Shovel\" in 2000. Around this time, Binaei's partial relocation of California led to hiring of Jay Jancetic of Extinction. McIlrath then departed from the band in 2000, in order to focus on Transistor Revolt and The Killing Tree, leading to the band's recruitment of, XshroudX and Restraint member, Christopher Gutierrez. In 2001, the released their debut album \"Where Sleeplessness Is Rest From Nightmares\". In support of the album they toured with Throwdown and Hatebreed, and performed at Hellfest. These tours also saw the recruitment of bassist Joe Trohman, after Gutierrez's departure, however Trohman's severe stage fright led to the band bringing him back mid-tour, and residing Trohman to selling merchandise.\n\nAround this time, Wentz also played in Birthright, Extinction and Yellow Road Priest. He and Arma Angelus' bassist Joe Trohman founded the pop-punk band Fall Out Boy after Trohman introduced Pete to a musical acquaintance, Patrick Stump. Andy Hurley agreed to drum part-time, but only joined the band full-time later. In 2002, Arma Angelus, the band in which Wentz was the vocalist, played its last show.\n\nIn 2002, Fall Out Boy released an EP called \"Fall Out Boy/Project Rocket Split EP\". Soon after, in 2003, the band released their mini-LP \"Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend\" on Uprising Records. This album would later be digitally remastered and reissued after the band's third, successful full-album release \"From Under the Cork Tree\", on the major label Island Records. In 2003, the band released their first full-length album, \"Take This to Your Grave\" through Fueled By Ramen. Fall Out Boy signed with major label Island Records in 2003 and in 2004 released an acoustic EP and DVD entitled, \"My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue\".\n\nTheir third album, \"From Under the Cork Tree\", was released in 2005.\nWentz wrote the lyrics to the lead single, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" with his dad in Chicago; the song peaked at #8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and spent months in the top 50 of the Hot 100, marking five weeks in the top 10 and fourteen weeks in the top 20. The band's major label debut album has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA as well as \"Sugar, We're Goin Down.\"\n\nIn 2007, Fall Out Boy's fourth album, \"Infinity on High\" was released to major success, debuting at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 260,000 sales, spurred by the lead single, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\", which reached the top ten in the US & UK and topped the charts in New Zealand. The second single, \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\" sold more than 2 million units in the US. The band's fifth studio album, \"Folie à Deux\" was released on December 13, 2008, and debuted at #8 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band toured extensively in support of their albums.\n\nOn November 20, 2009, the four band members announced they will be taking an indefinite hiatus, saying they were unsure of the future of the band. Wentz has said that his personal reason for taking a break is that he feels that his name and marriage to pop singer Ashlee Simpson had become a hindrance for the band. He added: \"I think the world needs a little less Pete Wentz\".\n\nOn February 4, 2013, Fall Out Boy unexpectedly announced their return, along with an album and single with which all four members contributed. Once again, Wentz had main control of song writing duties. On April 12, 2013, the band released a new album entitled, \"Save Rock and Roll,\" featuring the lead single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\", and dates for a new tour. The band played their first show in over three years on the night of February 4 in Chicago. 'Save Rock and Roll' peaked at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 154,000 copies in its first week, becoming the band's 4th consecutive top 10 album. With Fall Out Boy, Wentz toured heavily throughout 2013 and 2014 on the album, selling out arenas worldwide, with bands such as Paramore on the Monumentour. In October 2013, they released a new EP, \"PAX AM Days\" which they recorded in a two-day session with producer Ryan Adams.\n\nSixth studio album \"American Beauty/American Psycho\" was released to become the band's third \"Billboard\" 200 No. 1 album, debuting with 192,000 first week sales and 218,000 equivalent album units. The album was preceded by the triple Platinum top 10 single \"Centuries\". \"Uma Thurman\" was released to mainstream radio on April 14, 2014, and peaked at 22 on the 'Billboard' Top 100, and were certified as Platinum in August 2015.\n\nIn April 2017, Fall Out Boy released Young and Menace, the lead single for the seventh studio album. The band's seventh album \"Mania\" was officially released January 19, 2018, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making it the band's third consecutive and fourth chart-topping debut overall.\n\nIn 2018 Fall Out Boy headlined Wrigley Field in the band's hometown of Chicago, marking a milestone in their career as their first headline show at a stadium.\n\nIn July 2010, Wentz, with singer Bebe Rexha, guitarist Nate Patterson, and drummer Spencer Peterson, formed the ska/electropop band Black Cards. Originally, the band had planned to release a full-length LP in the summer of 2011. However, after several delays, the departures of both Patterson and Rexha, and general uncertainty about the band's future, the group reshuffled, scrapping the original album and announcing plans to release a mixtape, write new material, and continue to remix tracks by other artists.\n\nWith regards to the band's sound, Wentz has said that during the time he took off to spend with his family, he began to be inspired by Jamaican reggae songs such as Culture's \"Two Sevens Clash\" and The Gladiators' \"Warriors\". Wentz then contacted producer Sam Hollander (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hey Monday) and discussed the idea with him to mash up ska, dance and reggae with 80s British rock and pop to create a new experimental sound.\n\nOn January 12, 2012, the band announced via Facebook that vocalist Bebe Rexha was no longer a member of the group.\n\nApart from his musical career, Wentz has been involved in various entrepreneurial ventures. Fall Out Boy bandmate Patrick Stump says of Wentz's endeavors: \"It scares me sometimes, watching him. The two seconds you're not with that dude he's made 30 decisions that are going to affect our band for the rest of the year.\" Wentz's company, Clandestine Industries, distributes books, clothing, and other merchandise. On August 2, 2007, fashion company DKNY joined a partnership with Clandestine Industries. Wentz himself has served as a model on the DKNY/Clandestine promo website.\n\nIn April 2007, Pete came out with his own signature Squier Precision Bass. It has a black body with a red shell pickguard and special graphics that include Wentz's own red bat/heart design on the body, plus a black bat/diamond fingerboard inlay at the 12th fret. It also features Wentz's signature on the back of the headstock. Wentz owns a very similar custom Fender bass with a purple pickguard and bat/heart. In 2008, Fender gave his son, Bronx Wentz, a three-quarter-sized modified version of his guitar.\n\nWentz opened a nightclub in New York with his bandmates as well as members of Gym Class Heroes, The Academy Is..., and Cobra Starship; the bands' managers are also involved in the enterprise. Called Angels & Kings, the club occupies the former space on 11th Street near Avenue A that housed the Orchid Lounge. Notable guests, including Tommy Hilfiger, arrived for the grand opening on April 20, 2007. In June 2007, Wentz celebrated the opening of Angels & Kings' second location in Chicago.\n\nOn December 13, 2008, Wentz, along with Travis McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, created several pieces for an art exhibit at Gallery 1988 in Los Angeles called \"Without You, I'm Just Me.\" The exhibit closed on December 24, 2008. Wentz appeared in the season 5 episode of \"\", \"Point of No Return\", along with then-wife Ashlee Simpson. Wentz also hosted the Australia MTV VMAs on March 27, 2009.\n\nWentz collaborated with Mark Hoppus on the track \"In Transit\" on the \"Almost Alice\" soundtrack for the 2010 movie, \"Alice in Wonderland\". He was also a judge for the 10th and 11th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.\n\nWentz has written a book entitled \"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side,\" a story based on nightmares he had as a child. The title is a reference to a track on The Smiths' album \"The Queen Is Dead\". Wentz explained that writing books serves as another mode of self-expression other than songwriting: \"My inspiration and my ideas don't begin and end at the beginning and the ending of a song. It is too limiting.\" It was reported that he was to publish another book, entitled \"Rainy Day Kids\", but years went by without any word on the book's progress, and Wentz even expressed on his Twitter account that he didn't think it would ever come to fruition. However, in February 2012, he posted a photo on his personal blog of what appeared to be a rough draft of the book's manuscript, explaining that he was currently in the process of editing \"Rainy Day Kids\" and that it would be 40–50 pages longer than he originally expected. On December 13, 2012, Wentz revealed the cover for the book, now titled \"Gray\", on his personal blog. The book, which was written with MTV News writer and former FNMTV co-host James Montgomery, was released on February 26, 2013.\nIn June 2009, it was announced that Wentz was working on a five-issue comic book mini-series called \"Fall Out Toy Works\", to be published by Image Comics. The idea was conceived by Wentz and designer Darren Romanelli. The plot is loosely based on the Fall Out Boy song \"Tiffany Blews\" and focuses on \"a mysterious toymaker, a cyborg gal named Tiffany and a kid in a bear suit that looks lifted from the cover of Fall Out Boy's \"Folie á Deux.\"\" With writing by Brett Lewis, and art by Sam Basri, the first issue was released on September 2, 2009.\n\nWentz also has a film production company called Bartskull Films, which put out the DVD \"Release the Bats\", starring Wentz, his bandmates, and several of his personal friends. Wentz has told several sources that he has all the footage to release a sequel, but editing and time constraints have kept him from doing so, and therefore the fate of the project is still up in the air.\n\nWentz was in a multi-episode arc of the show \"One Tree Hill\", appearing at Tric (the local all-ages club in Tree Hill) with the entire band. The band first appeared in an episode \"An Attempt to Tip the Scales\", where they played their single \"Dance, Dance\" and went on to appear on Peyton and Ellie's (also One Tree Hill's album) tribute album, \"Friends with Benefit\" to support cancer awareness. Pete made his first solo cameo in the episode \"When It Isn't Like It Should Be\" as the romantic interest of Peyton Sawyer, a senior at Tree Hill who had booked the band to play at Tric.\n\nHe also made a brief cameo appearance in the show \"Californication\". On February 6, 2008, it was reported that Wentz was the leading candidate for writer Diablo Cody's follow-up film to \"Juno\", \"Jennifer's Body\". The role ended up going to Adam Brody. On February 24, 2008, Wentz appeared in comedian Jimmy Kimmel's video \"I'm Fucking Ben Affleck\" as a chorus member (along with many other celebrities). The video was in response to one made by Kimmel's then-girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\".\n\nIn 2009, he made a cameo appearance as himself in \"Degrassi Goes Hollywood\". In 2016, he made a guest appearance on the Nickelodeon series, \"School of Rock\".\n\nIn 2012, he appeared as himself on \"The Eric Andre Show\".\n\nIn 2017, Wentz guest starred, with his bandmates, in Cartoon Network's \"Teen Titans Go!\" playing himself in the first, third and fourth parts of \"The Night Begins to Shine\". Their cover of the title song from the special was commercially released.\n\nWentz hosts the TV show \"Best Ink\". Wentz directed a music video for the song \"If It's Love\" by American rock band Train. He was a contestant in an episode of the Nickelodeon game show \"Double Dare\".\n\nIn 2020, he made a guest appearance on 2 episodes of the Nickelodeon show, \"All That\".\n\nWentz has bipolar disorder, and has taken medication for it since he was eighteen. In February 2005, Wentz attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the anxiety medication Ativan<nowiki>, and as a result, spent a week in the hospital. Commenting on the event to a magazine, he said:</nowiki>\n\nThe suicide attempt was put into song form, \"7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen)\" and released on their album, \"From Under the Cork Tree\". After this event, Wentz moved back in with his parents. Wentz later spoke of his suicide attempt to the support site Halfofus.com.\n\nIn 2006, Wentz started dating singer Ashlee Simpson. In April 2008, Simpson and Wentz confirmed their engagement, and were married on May 17, 2008, at Simpson's parents' residence in Encino, California, with her father officiating the ceremony. Two weeks later, she confirmed her pregnancy. Her surname changed from Simpson to Wentz and she was briefly known professionally as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Simpson gave birth to their son, Bronx Mowgli, on November 20, 2008.\n\nOn February 8, 2011, Simpson filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". She asked for joint custody and primary physical custody of their son with visitation for Wentz, along with spousal support. However, a later report said that Simpson believed the couple simply \"married too young\", with the source stating that, \"It was honestly a classic case of marrying young, having a kid young and growing apart over the years\". Wentz reportedly did not want the divorce. Their divorce was finalized on November 22, 2011.\n\nOn February 17, 2014, Wentz and his current girlfriend Meagan Camper announced that the couple were expecting their first child together and Wentz's second. Their son Saint Lazslo Wentz was born in August 2014. On January 2, 2018, Wentz posted to his Instagram that he and Camper were expecting their second child together and Wentz's third, a girl. On May 13, 2018, their daughter Marvel Jane Wentz was born.\n\nWentz is a supporter of Invisible Children, Inc., an organization dedicated to helping the cause of displaced refugees in Uganda. He and Fall Out Boy traveled to the nation, and filmed the music video for the song \"I'm Like a Lawyer... (Me & You)\" there. Prior to the trip, he participated in an event organized by Invisible Children called \"Displace Me\", in which 67,000 activists throughout the United States slept in the streets in makeshift cardboard villages, hoping to raise awareness about those displaced by the Ugandan government.\n\nAlong with Mary J. Blige and Billy Corgan, Wentz is a spokesperson for The Jed Foundation's Half of Us campaign, a program aimed at lowering the rate of teenage suicide.\n\nWentz was a vegetarian for many years, and appeared on the ballot of PETA2's third annual \"Sexiest Vegetarian\" awards.\n\n\n\n"}

It was directed and produced by twin brothers Wolfgang and Christoph Lauenstein.\n\nThe film depicts five individuals living on a small platform floating in space. These men are all identical apart from a number at the back of their coats: 23, 35, 51, 75, and 77. Whenever one of them moves, the platform tilts and the others must move as well to ensure that the platform does not tip over. They all move out to the edge of the platform, take out fishing rods, and cast their lines over the edge. The one numbered 51 reels in a large, heavy box while the others scramble to the opposite side of the platform. One by one, the individuals inspect the box: it has a wind-up key that causes the box to play music. As each man in turn moves to inspect the box, the platform becomes unstable, prompting each of the group to converge in the center to keep the platform from tipping over. The man with the number 75 attempts to tip the box over the edge, but number 51 counterbalances the platform to prevent it. These two scuffle briefly, causing the box to slide to number 23, who tap dances to the tune as the others look on. 75 moves away from the center of gravity, tipping the platform and causing the box to slide toward him, but 23 sits on top of the box and moves with it.\n\nThe added weight moves the box to the very edge of the platform. The others rearrange themselves to bring the box back to the center. Riding the box as it slides from side to side, 23 pushes 35 off the platform as the former slides to the very edge. The others rearrange themselves again to compensate for the loss of mass. 51 trips and falls over. 75 shoves 77 to the ground as he avoids the careening 23. 77 scrambles to the opposite edge as 23 moves with the box again. 23 kicks 75 off the platform, unbalancing the platform and causing 77 to fall over the edge also. 23 gets off the box, approaches 51 and kicks him over the edge. Now alone, 23 turns around to look at the box, which is perched on the edge farthest from him. Without the others, 23 has to maintain the balance on his own, keeping the box out of reach. One step back and he falls, one step forward and the box falls. He can only watch as the box slowly winds down and plays its music, which 23 is unable to hear.\n\n\"Balance\" won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short of 1989.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2008, the group received the Best Asian Newcomer Award at the Asia Song Festival and a Cable Music Award at the 41st Japan Cable Awards ceremony. As of December 2014, the group had released 36 singles, nine studio albums, one EP and one compilation album. Berryz Kobo's combined CD and DVD sales exceeded one million copies in Japan alone.\n\nAll of the group's members were initially selected during the audition for Hello!

Project Kids' members were placed in bands led by Morning Musume members. Miyabi Natsuyaki was selected to be in Aa!, while Saki Shimizu and Momoko Tsugunaga were in the group ZYX. Both units were short-lived, and their activities stalled with the creation of Berryz Kobo.\n\nThe formation of Berryz Kobo was announced at a Hello! Project club event on 14 January 2004. The band was composed of eight members of Hello! Project Kids, who were then known as the \"starting line-up\". Initially it was planned to rotate all 15 members of Hello! Project Kids through the group, which would have given Berryz Kobo's members more time for school. Later, however, the idea was dismissed, and the remaining seven Hello! Project Kids members formed the group Cute in 2005.\n\nOn 3 March 2004, the new band debuted with the single \"Anata Nashi de wa Ikite Yukenai\", which ranked 18th on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. Two more singles followed in April and May, and on 7 July the group released its first album, titled \"1st Chō Berryz\".\n\nIn addition to their activity as Berryz Kobo, the girls also performed as backup dancers in music videos of the newly created Hello!

It was Berryz Kobo's first single to rank in the top 10, and their first to sell more than 20,000 copies. At that time, the group's average age was less than 12 years old.\n\nOn 11 September 2005, it was announced that Maiha Ishimura would graduate from the group and Hello! Project to focus on her studies. Ishimura's graduation took place on 2 October 2005, on the last night of the Berryz Kobo autumn 2005 concert tour.\n\nThe 10th single, \"Jiriri Kiteru,\" was released on the 29th of March. It was ranked in sixth place on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, setting a new high for the group.\n\nIn February 2007, Berryz Kobo made news headlines after it was announced that the group would be holding a concert at Saitama Super Arena on 1 April. The tickets for the two performances (a total of 20,000 seats) sold out almost two months before the premiere, and the group became the youngest act ever to perform a solo concert at the arena. At the time its members' average age was 13.8, with the previous record of 16.3 set by Morning Musume four years earlier.\n\nOn 27 June, Berryz released their 14th single \"Kokuhaku no Funsui Hiroba.\" It ranked fourth on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, becoming their highest-selling single.\n\nOn the 12th of March 2008 the group released \"Dschinghis Khan,\" their first cover song and, as of 2012, their highest- selling single.\n\nIn October, Berryz Kobo participated at the 2008 Asia Song Festival in South Korea, representing Japan alongside W-inds and Anna Tsuchiya. Berryz won the festival's Best Asian Newcomer Award alongside the SM Entertainment group Shinee.\n\nOn 12 December, they performed at Sharam Q's 20th anniversary concert at the Nippon Budokan. The group took part in the 41st show at Nakano Sun Plaza on 17 December, performing \"Dschinghis Khan,\" for which they received a , awarded to the most requested song on the Cansystem cable radio network. The year ended with the group's debut at the 58th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual music show broadcast on 31 December. They performed a number together with Morning Musume and Cute.\n\nIn March, Berryz Kobo First Fan Club Tour in Hawaii '09 was held in Honolulu, Hawaii, where the band performed exclusively for the members of the Japanese fan club. It was the group's first overseas fan club tour.\n\nThe Sunday, 22 March, concert in Nagoya was cancelled just a few of days before the date, because two members, Miyabi Natsuyaki and Risako Sugaya, were suffering from influenza.\n\nOn 25 April the girls celebrated the group's 100th solo concert in Utsunomiya, Tochigi during their spring concert tour Sono Subete no Ai ni. \n\nOn 3 June, the group released their 20th single and their first double A-side single, \"Seishun Bus Guide/Rival.\" \"Seishun Bus Guide\" was a closing theme for the anime series \"Inazuma Eleven\". On 21 June, the group held a mini-concert in Korea, which became their first commercial solo concert outside Japan.\n\nIn autumn 2009, the group was again affected by influenza. On Tuesday, 13 October, fans were notified that Momoko Tsugunaga was diagnosed with influenza and would be absent from the concert scheduled for Saturday. The next day, Miyabi Natsuyaki was reported to be diagnosed as well after having felt sick the previous evening, and it was announced that the Sunday concert had to be cancelled due to Maasa Sudo and Risako Sugaya also having influenza. The next day, Hello! Project reported that Saki Shimizu joined her friends, affecting five of the seven members.\nIn the beginning of November, the flu got to Chinami Tokunaga, followed by Yurina Kumai a couple of days later; causing them to miss the 7 and 8 November concerts.\n\nIn spring, the group performed in Bangkok, Thailand, for the first time.\n\nOn 3 March, the group released their third double A-side single, \"Otakebi Boy Wao!/Tomodachi wa Tomodachi Nanda!\" The single debuted on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart at number three, making it their highest-ranking single to date. It also stayed in the top 10 for a second week, ranking ninth.\n\nIn July they released a new single, \"Maji Bomber!!,\" which was used as an ending theme for both the anime \"Inazuma Eleven\" and the game the anime was based upon. Their next single and their final \"Inazuma Eleven\" ending theme, \"Shining Power,\" was released on 10 November.\n\nOn 3 March, the anniversary of the group's debut, the group began its seventh-anniversary tour. \n\nBerryz Kobo's 25th single \"Heroine ni Narō ka!\" (\"Let's be Heroines\") reached number one on the Oricon Daily Singles Chart for 6 March. The concert that was scheduled for 12 March in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, was abruptly canceled due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which hit the day before. All of the group's members were safe, but the tour had to be stopped. The concerts were either canceled or postponed until the end of March. At the end of March, Berryz Kobo released their seventh album, \"7 Berryz Times\".\n\nIn April, the group performed at Sakura-Con 2011, an anime convention in Seattle, Washington, United States. This was the first performance by Berryz Kobo in the United States. The group participated in events such as autograph sessions, question and answer sessions, and a concert. 3,500 people were reported to have attended the concert.\n\nOn 8 June, the group released their 26th single, \"Ai no Dangan\".\n\nOn 10 August, the group released their 27th single, titled \"Aa, Yo ga Akeru\".\n\nIn 2012, Berryz Kobo's leader Saki Shimizu announced on her official blog that on 21 March, the new Berryz Kobo single \"Be Genki! (Naseba Naru)\" would be released.\n\nThe group's eighth album \"Ai no Album 8\" was released on 22 February.\n\nOn 8–10 June, the group appeared at AnimeNEXT in Somerset, New Jersey, their second live performance in USA. On 20 June, the group released its second collaboration CD single with fellow Hello! Project Kids group Cute, named \"Chō Happy Song\" (\"Super Happy Song.\") The title tune is an overlay of two previously published songs, Berryz Kobo's \"Because Happiness\" and Cute's \"Shiawase no Tochū\" (\"On the Road to Happiness\") from their 2012 albums, which were composed and produced by Tsunku intentionally to form a new song when played simultaneously. The trick was originally scheduled to be announced at a summer Hello! Project concert, but was uncovered by fans in mid-April. The song became widely discussed on the Internet, and the set of three tracks, \"Because Happiness\", \"Shiawase no Tochū\", and \"Chō Happy Song\", was hastily released as a digital download single on 28 April.\n\nOn 25 July, the group released their 29th single, \"Cha Cha Sing,\" a cover song of the popular Thai song \"Row Mah Sing\" by artist Thongchai McIntyre. The single was the group's first to include a solo song, \"Momochi! Yurushite-nyan Taisō,\" which was performed by member Momoko Tsugunaga.\n\nIt was announced on 19 May in Tokyo's Hibiya Park that Berryz Kobo would be holding a concert at the Nippon Budokan arena on 29 November 2013.\n\nOn 2 October, the group released their 33rd single, \"Motto Zutto Issho ni Itakatta,\" which became their highest selling single (with a reported total of 40,845 copies,) beating Dschinghis Khan's 37,096 copies. On 11 November, Berryz Kobo held their special concert at the Nippon Budokan.\n\nIt was announced on 2 August 2014, at the summer Hello! Project concerts that Berryz Kobo would be going on an \"indefinite suspension starting Spring 2015\". The girls decided together that they would like to explore other opportunities. The decision to call this an \"indefinite suspension\" was made since the girls felt calling this move a \"disbandment\" would cause Berryz Kobo to disappear or fade away. The group continued its activities until the spring of 2015, iwhen their final appearances and performances would be announced and take place. Tsunku added he would \"like to see them chase new dreams\" and asked for continued support throughout their remaining time as an active group.\n\nOn 24 February 2015, Shimizu and Tokunaga announced on their blogs they would remain with the company as advisors, where they would act as the \"go-between\" for the staff and members. The next day Sugaya announced she would take time off to focus on her personal life. The following day Kumai stated on her blog that she would finish her university degree and would pursue a modeling career.\n\nBerryz Kobo have performed and made appearances outside Japan numerous times.\n\nIn 2009 M-net and Up-Front Works arranged a Berryz Kobo mini-concert in South Korea on 21 June at Yonsei University Auditorium, titled Berryz Kobo Mini Live in Korea. This was the group's first concert outside Japan.\n\nIn 2010 Berryz Kobo was chosen over Morning Musume and Cute to perform in Thailand. Their concert was held on 27 March at the Hua Mark Indoor Stadium, formally known as Rajamangala National Stadium. This was the group's second performance outside Japan.\n\nOn the last day of the group's Autumn 2010 concert tour, captain Saki Shimizu announced that they would be performing at the anime convention Sakura-Con in Seattle, the United States on 22–24 April 2011. Their American concert debut at Sakura-Con 2011 had an audience of 3,500. Fans traveled from all over the world, including many parts of the US, Canada, France, Mexico, and Japan to support the group as they celebrated their seventh year together. During the weekend the members appeared at the event's opening and closing ceremonies, participated in a live audience Q&A, held two 60-minute sessions where they signed autographs, and performed an hour-long concert consisting of 14 songs. This was the group's third performance outside Japan, and first outside Asia. Berryz Kobo was the third Hello! Project major act to perform outside Asia following Morning Musume (in Los Angeles, 2009 and Paris, 2010), and Erina Mano (in Los Angeles, 2010).\n\nOn 8–10 June 2012, the group performed at AnimeNEXT, an anime convention in Somerset, New Jersey, in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe are sponsored by the .\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> awarded to the most requested song of the year on the cable radio\n\n"}

It is based on the .30-06 Springfield cartridge necked-down (case opening made narrower) to .257 caliber with no other changes. Nominal bullet diameter is 0.257 inches (6.5 mm), with typical bullet weights ranging from . The bore diameter of the .25-06 Rem is .250 inches (6.35 mm) making it a \".25\"/6.35 mm caliber\", not to be confused with the more well known 6.5 mm bore caliber which uses 6.7 mm/.264\" bullets.\n\nCharles Newton necked down the .30-06 Springfield cartridge in 1912 to accept the 117-grain .25-35 Winchester bullet. Newton's early modification encouraged commercial release of a shortened case (from 63 to 49mm) as the .250-3000 Savage in 1915. Frankford Arsenal developed an experimental .25-06 during World War I; and distribution of surplus United States military equipment through the Civilian Marksmanship Program following the war encouraged independent gunsmiths to experiment with the cartridge. A. O. Niedner of Dowagiac, Michigan introduced rifles for the .25 Niedner in 1920. Niedner Arms Corporation retained the 17° 30′ .30-06 shoulder chambering .25 caliber barrels rifled with one twist in . Similar cartridges were identified as the .25 Hi-Power, .25 Whelen (analogous to .35 Whelen), or .25-100-3000 (to indicate the ability to achieve 3000 feet per second with a 100 grain bullet rather than the 87 grain bullet used in the .250-3000 Savage). Greater case capacity offered minimal velocity improvement over the .250-3000 Savage case with contemporary smokeless powders. Availability of DuPont's Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powders encouraged commercial release of the .257 Roberts using the 57mm-long Mauser case in 1934. Release of IMR 4350 in 1940 and availability of surplus 4831 powder salvaged from Oerlikon 20mm cannon cartridges after World War II greatly improved performance of the full-length .25-06 case.\n\nThe cartridge is capable of propelling a 117 grain (7.6 g) bullet at up to 3,200 feet per second (980 m/s) and energy levels up to . Bullets lighter than 75 grains are available in .257 caliber, but were designed for the smaller .25-20 Winchester and .25-35 Winchester cartridges and are too lightly constructed for the high velocities of the .25-06.\n\nThe cartridge has less felt recoil than a 30-06 in a similar weight rifle, due to the lighter weight bullets used. Shooters who are recoil sensitive will find the recoil from the 25-06 bearable, but not pleasant enough to shoot all day long. This cartridge is not quite as powerful as the .257 Weatherby Magnum, usually running . slower with a given bullet weight.\n\nSAAMI pressure limit for the .25-06 is 63,000 PSI.\n\n.25-caliber bullets typically have high ballistic coefficients without being heavy. This characteristic, when combined with the large case capacity of its parent .30-06 case, allows relatively high muzzle velocities without heavy recoil. The combination of high ballistic coefficients with high muzzle velocities give the .25-06 a very flat trajectory as well as retaining kinetic energy down-range.\n\nThe .25-06 is generally considered to be a good round for medium-sized game such as deer and antelope because of its combination of substantial kinetic energy and moderate recoil. The addition of a flat trajectory makes it particularly popular in plains states where the open fields can require longer-range shots on game, as this flatness tends to minimize range-estimation errors by the hunter. However bullet types and weights are loaded that allow the .25-06 to be used for taking game ranging from small animals like prairie dogs and coyotes to heavier elk. These bullets range from lightly constructed 75-grain bullets with muzzle velocities in the 3,700 ft/s (1,130 m/s) range to more robust 120-grain bullets with muzzle velocities in the 3,000 ft/s (915 m/s) range.\n\nMost manufacturers of bolt action or single-shot rifles offer the .25-06 as a standard chambering and factory loaded ammunition is available from Remington, Winchester, Federal Cartridge and most other major manufacturers.\n\n\n"}

It is owned by Eric Birnbaum and operated by Caesars Entertainment. The Rio was the first all suite resort in the Las Vegas area. It was named after the city of Rio de Janeiro and is influenced by Brazilian culture. It is the host casino for the World Series of Poker.\n\nThe hotel towers are covered in blue and red glass. The Rio hotel's 2,522 suites range in size from and have floor to ceiling windows. There are several private villas on the property for high-rollers.\n\nThe complex includes a wine cellar that has more than 50,000 bottles. The Rio Pavilion convention center has a total of of space. A Race and Sports Book is also available.\n\nThe Rio opened on January 15, 1990, as a locals casino; it had been constructed and owned and operated by Marnell Corrao Associates. The opening acts were the Brazilian group Sérgio Mendes '99 and Henrietta Alves of New Orleans, bringing the first two-piano act to Las Vegas, with various co-performers. A 20-story expansion tower was added to the current Ipanema Tower in 1993. Masquerade Village, a hotel tower and casino expansion including the \"Masquerade Show in the Sky\", opened in 1997 at a cost of over $200 million. The Rio was purchased by Harrah's Entertainment (later named Caesars Entertainment) in 1999 for $888 million. After the purchase, the Culinary Workers Union organized the Rio employees through card check recognition by enforcing the neutrality clause of the existing Harrah's contract on the new acquisition.\n\nDanny Gans, after moving from the Stratosphere Las Vegas, opened as the headliner in 1998. He later moved to The Mirage in 2000. Penn & Teller have been the resident headline entertainers since 2001.\n\nThe Rio's Penn & Teller Theater was the host venue of the 30th anniversary special for the hit CBS game show \"The Price Is Right\" and has been used for \"Live! with Regis and Kelly\", \"Hell's Kitchen\" and numerous \"Penn & Teller\" television projects. The hotel hosted the World Series of Poker in 2005, the first time this event was not held at Binion's. Binion's was used for the final three tables and the last two days of the competition as part of the celebration of Las Vegas' centennial. Since 2005, the Rio has been the home for the tournament.\n\nIn December 2019, Caesars sold the Rio for $516 million to New York-based real estate developer Eric Birnbaum. Under the deal, Caesars would continue to operate the Rio under lease for at least two years, paying $45 million a year in rent.\n\nKISS by Monster Mini Golf is a franchise of the Monster Mini Golf chain; as the name suggests, this location is based on classic rock band KISS. In addition to the 18-hole miniature golf course, the venue also boasts a Rock and Roll Themed wedding chapel called the \"I Love It Loud Wedding Chapel\", the world's largest KISS gift shop, and a KISS Museum featuring memorabilia from the band's career on display. It also hosts regular appearances by KISS band members, both past and present.\n\nOn May 30, 2008, the Rio opened the Sapphire Pool in conjunction with a local club. The daylight-hour, adults-only club surrounded one of the property's outdoor pools and featured dancers. It opened with a $30-per-male-customer admission price. The venture was a high-profile joint venture between a casino company and a topless business, and was notable because the possibility of bringing in criminal activity at the club had caused the Nevada Gaming Control Board to balk at previous collaborations; some in the media questioned whether the risk was worth the potential payoff for the hotel.\n\nIn late July 2009, the Rio hotel asked the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) to do a routine undercover investigation of the Sapphire Pool, as casino-resorts in Nevada are held responsible for the activities held on their premises. The request was a part of the resort's effort to show good faith to the Gaming Control Board. The July 25 visit resulted in 11 arrests. Upon finding out the results of the investigation, the Rio immediately shut down the pool.\n\nWhen Creation Entertainment lost the \"Star Trek mecca\" for its annual Official Convention after the closing of at the adjoining former Las Vegas Hilton, the convention moved to the Rio in 2011 and has grown ever since. For 2016, the 50th anniversary of Star Trek, the event expands to a fifth day and by December 31, 2015, had already broken a room-reservation record with 12,000+ rooms reserved by attendees, guests and vendors.\n\nThe SKUSA SuperNationals, a kart racing event to which international kart and car drivers are invited (Michael Schumacher raced in 2009), takes place each year at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, a circuit is set on the hotel parking lot.\n\nThe DEF CON hacker convention took place at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino from 2011 to 2014.\n\nThe Computer Measurement Group (CMG) annual conference took place at the Rio in December 2012.\n\n\n"}

The corridor was established under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nCurrently the corridor is defined by a series of highways. However, the corridor is also proposed for use by railroads and fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nThe CANAMEX Trade Corridor was outlined in 1991 in the \"ISTEA\" highway bill, and defined by Congress in the 1995 National Highway Systems Designation Act, Public Law 104-59, November 28, 1995.\n\nThe CANAMEX corridor is defined by the numbered highway designations along its length:\n\nCanada\n\nUnited States\n\nMexico\nSince the CANAMEX corridor was originally proposed, a second proposal, Interstate 11, would run along a similar path in Nevada and Arizona and replace most of the current non-freeway segments in those states.\n\nThe United States portion of the highway was established as a High Priority Corridor. The treaty establishes that the CANAMEX highway will be upgraded to at least 4 lanes along its entire length. In 2008, 84% of the highway in the United States was compliant, 86% of the highway in Mexico was compliant. The Canada portion was completed in 2007.\n\nWhen the corridor was first approved, two bottlenecks were identified with the Arizona portion of the corridor that required significant infrastructure to address. The first was the route of U.S. Route 93 across northwestern Arizona, which at the time included a slow route with numerous hairpin curves over the Hoover Dam. The Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 16, 2010, resolving this issue.\n\nThe second issue was a gap near Phoenix. The official designation is Interstate 10 to U.S. Route 93 at Phoenix. However, US 93 does not enter Phoenix or connect with I-10. US 93 currently terminates at Wickenburg, northwest of Phoenix. To make this connection originally required driving U.S. Route 60, a surface street through the western suburbs of Phoenix, not compliant with the standards established by the treaty. The chosen alternative for resolution involved creating a compliant connection between Wickenburg and Phoenix via upgrades and extensions to Arizona State Route 303. Most of the upgrades have been completed, with the final phase expected to be complete by the end of 2016. A second proposal has since been made for a freeway connection between Las Vegas, Nevada and Casa Grande, Arizona, Interstate 11, that would in its course connect Wickenburg to Phoenix.\n\nNAFTA also established the CANAMEX corridor for rail usage. The Union Pacific Railroad owns and operates rail lines loosely following the highway corridor between Las Vegas and Canada, acquired from the former Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad and the Oregon Short Line. The Union Pacific also owns a rail line between Phoenix, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico acquired from the former Southern Pacific Railroad. However, there is no existing railroad line directly connecting Las Vegas and Phoenix. Rail traffic between these cities currently uses the Arizona and California Railway and/or BNSF Railway via Barstow, California for a connection.\n\n\n"}

Trinkaus researches the evolution of the species \"Homo sapiens\" and recent human diversity, focusing on the paleoanthropology and emergence of late archaic and early modern humans, and the subsequent evolution of anatomically modern humanity. Trinkaus is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and the Mary Tileston Hemenway Professor Emeritus of Arts and Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. He is a frequent contributor to publications such as \"Science\", \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\", \"PLOS One\", \"American Journal of Physical Anthropology\", and the \"Journal of Human Evolution\" and has written/co-written or edited/co-edited fifteen books in paleoanthropology. He is frequently quoted in the popular media.\n\nTrinkaus received his bachelor of arts degree in Art History from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1970), and his master's and PhD degrees in Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania, the latter in 1975.\n\nTrinkaus has been primarily concerned with the biology and behavior of the Neandertals and early modern humans, through the Middle and Late Pleistocene, in order shed light on these past humans and to understand the emergence and establishment of modern humans. His work has therefore been primarily concerned with the comparative and functional anatomy, paleopathology and life history of these past humans. At the same time, because it dominates paleoanthropology, he has been involved in debates concerning the ancestry of modern humans, being one of the first to argue for an African origin of modern humans but with substantial Neandertal ancestry among Eurasian modern human populations.\n\nAlthough his early work emphasized differences between the Neandertals (and other archaic humans) and early modern humans, his work since the 1990s has documented many similarities across these human groups in terms of function, levels of activity, stress levels, and abilities to cope socially with the rigors of a Pleistocene foraging existence. His research therefore the involves biomechanical analysis of cranio-facial and post-cranial remains, patterns of tooth wear, interpretations of ecogeographical patterning, life history parameters (growth and mortality), differential levels and patterns of stress (paleopathology), issues of survival, and the interrelationships between these patterns.\n\nTrinkaus has conducted a series of comparative analyses, with colleagues and students, on the regional functional anatomy of Neandertals and other Pleistocene humans. He has contributed to the direct radiocarbon dating of original human fossils, and through that work to insights into their diets through the analysis of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes.\nHe has been involved in the primary paleontological descriptions of a number of Middle and Late Pleistocene human remains, of both archaic and early modern humans. The first project was his monograph on the Shanidar Neandertals from Iraqi Kurdistan. Subsequent major projects concerned with early modern humans include the Abrigo do Lagar Velho (Portugal) Dolní Věstonice and Pavlov Moravia, Czech Republic, Peştera cu Oase (Romania), Peştera Muierii (Romania), Mladeč (Czech Republic), Tianyuandong (China), and Sunghir (Russia). Additional Neandertal descriptions include those from Krapina (Croatia), Oliveira (Portugal), Kiik-Koba (Crimea), and Sima de las Palomas (Spain). To these can be added Middle Pleistocene human remains from Aubesier (France), Broken Hill (Zambia) and Hualongdong (China), plus late archaic humans remains from Xujiayao and Xuchang (China). These paleontological descriptions include both primary data on these fossils and a diversity of paleobiological interpretations of the remains and the Pleistocene human groups from which they derive.\n\nTrinkaus’s analyses of early modern human remains, especially those from Dolní Věstonice, Pavlov, Lagar Velho and Sunghir, have raised a series of questions regarding the nature and diversity of mortuary practices among these early modern humans. And his paleopathological analyses of Pleistocene human remains have raised questions concerning the levels and natures of trauma and developmental abnormalities among these people.\n\n"}

{"id": "2237953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237953", "title": "Assos", "text": "Assos\n\nAssos (; , ), also known as Behramkale or for short Behram, is a small historically rich town in the Ayvacık district of the Çanakkale Province, Turkey. During Pliny the Elder's time (1st century CE), the city also bore the name Apollonia (Ἀπολλωνία).\n\nAfter leaving the Platonic Academy in Athens, Aristotle (joined by Xenocrates) went to Assos, where he was welcomed by King Hermias, and opened an Academy in this city. Aristotle also married Pythias, the adopted daughter of Hermias. In the Academy of Assos, Aristotle became a chief to a group of philosophers, and together with them, he made innovative observations on zoology and biology. When the Persians attacked Assos, King Hermias was caught and put to death. Aristotle fled to Macedonia, which was ruled by his friend King Philip II of Macedon. There, he tutored Philip's son, Alexander the Great. There is a modern statue of Aristotle at the town entrance.\n\nThe Acts of the Apostles refers to visits by Luke the Evangelist and Paul the Apostle to Assos ()\n\nToday, Assos is an Aegean-coast seaside retreat amid ancient ruins. Since 2017 it is inscribed in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey.\n\nThough the town is officially named Behramkale (), most people still call it by its ancient name of Assos. The town is on the southern side of Biga Peninsula, better known by its ancient name, Troad. Assos is located on the coast of the Adramyttian Gulf (Turkish: Edremit Körfezi).\n\nMuch of the surrounding area is visible from the ancient Temple of Athena, built on top of a trachyte crag. The view from this temple on a clear day extends to nearby Lesbos in the south, Pergamum in the southeast, and Mount Ida in Phrygia in the east. To the north, the Tuzla River flows. To the northwest, two massive Hellenic columns still mark the gate to the city.\n\nAssos had the only good harbour on the of the north coast of the Adramyttian Gulf. This made Assos a key shipping station through the Troad.\n\nThe city was founded from 1000 to 900 BC by Aeolian colonists from Lesbos, who specifically are said to have come from Methymna. The natural cleavage of the rock into joint planes had already scarped out shelves which it was comparatively easy for human labour to shape. The settlers built a Doric Temple to Athena on top of the crag in 530 BC. From this temple Hermias of Atarneus, a student of Plato, ruled Assos, the Troad and Lesbos for a period of time, under which the city experienced its greatest prosperity. (Strangely, Hermias was actually the slave of the ruler of Atarneus.) Under his rule, he encouraged philosophers to move to the city. As part of this, in 348 BC Aristotle came here and married King Hermeias's niece, Pythia, before leaving for Lesbos three years later in 345 BC. This 'golden period' of Assos ended several years later when the Persians arrived, and subsequently tortured Hermias to death.\n\nThe Persians were driven out by Alexander the Great in 334 BC. Between 241 and 133 BC, the city was ruled by the Kings of Pergamon. However, in 133 BC, the Pergamons lost control of the city as it was absorbed by the Roman empire.\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, St. Paul also visited the city during his third missionary journey through Asia Minor, which was between 53-57 AD, on his way to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. Acts 20 records that Luke the Evangelist and his companions ('we') \"went ahead to the ship and sailed [from Troas] to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board ... and when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene\".\n\nFrom this period onwards, Assos shrunk to a small village, as it has remained ever since. Ruins around Assos continue to be excavated.\n\nThe pillars from the ancient port lay in the harbor for over a millennia. Eventually they were probably sold.\n\nIn the early 1900s an attempt was made to move the contents of the Temple of Athena. Much of the art has been moved to museums like the Louvre. The art found includes pictures both of mythical creatures and heraldic events.\n\nIn 2018, archaeologists discovered a Hellinistic undamaged family grave. the name \"Aristios\" was written on the cover of the grave. The grave belonged to a family of 21. One of the family members was buried normally, while the remaining 20 were cremated and their ashes were placed inside urn-like vases. The lids were sealed off with cement in order to prevent any foreign substance getting inside the urns.\n\nMany of the old buildings of Assos are in ruins today, but Behramkale (the city's modern name) is still active. It still serves as a port for the Troad. On the acropolis 238 m above sea level are the remains of the Doric order Temple of Athena, which date back to 530 BC. Six of the original 38 columns remain. West of the acropolis stands the well preserved 4th century BC city wall and main gate with towers. An ancient paved road leads northeast through the gate to the ruins of a large 2nd-century BC gymnasium, a 2nd-century BC agora and a bouleuterion. Further south toward the seashore is a 3rd-century BC theatre built for 5,000 spectators.\n\nDown the steep seaward side of the hill at the water's edge is the hamlet called \"İskele\" (meaning \"Pier\" or \"Wharf\"), with old stone houses now serving as inns, pensions and restaurants.\n\nThere is a small pebbly beach. There are boat tours and tours of the hamlet itself. Although the narrow road to the hamlet is steep with sheer drops, the sea front has a constant stream of cars and minibuses arriving from dawn to dusk.\n\nIn 2018, archaeologists discovered many Strigils. Some of the strigils found were iron, but most were made of bronze.\n\nA 2,200-year-old lion sculpture  of the Hellenistic period and a 1,500-year-old stone oven dating back to the Byzantine period were revealed by the archaeologists in Assos, Turkey. According to the Professor Nurettin Arslan, the statue was unearthed from the structure which was used to be an inn throughout that period, and one of the Byzantine period findings contained a cooking stove with three pots. \n\n\n"}

On television, it was a regular weekly series on the Nine Network from 12 September 1987 to 26 November 2004.\n\nThe program began on the Sydney AM radio station 2UE on Saturday and Sunday mornings before being picked up by the Nine Network in late 1987. Channel 9 broadcast the show on Friday evenings for the next 17 years. It is currently being broadcast on radio by 2UE and syndicated stations on Saturday and Sunday mornings. A magazine of the same name as the television program was published as a merchandising tie-in by Australian Consolidated Press. Don Burke went on to join Jamie Durie in creating the television show \"Backyard Blitz\".\n\nThe show is hosted by Don Burke but also includes other presenters. The cooking segment was presented by Geoff Jansz, who also hosted the Channel Nine cooking show Fresh. Tara Dennis coordinated the fabrics and design section, while Rebecca Harris coordinated the pet section as she also did in her own Nine series Animal Hospital. Harris sometimes appeared also on the design and fabric segments. Scott Cam assisted Don as the building, gardening and design expert for more than half the program's duration. Other cast members include \"The Great Outdoors\" reporter Ernie Dingo, Dr.Chris Brown, Nigel Ruck, Jackie French, Elise Pascoe, Rita Hill, Dr.Harry Cooper, Reg Livermore and Rosemary Stanton.\n\nFor the 2007 television specials, Don Burke was assisted mainly by Scott Cam. Former Olympic Gold Medalist swimmer Giaan Rooney also joined the cast for the specials, giving environmental tips, while financial expert Paul Clitheroe presented the financial section.\n\nThe theme to \"Burke's Backyard\" is a modified version of the Bullamakanka's version of \"Give Me A Home Among The Gumtrees\" (Bob Brown; Walter Johnson Jr.) The chorus is as follows:\n\n\"Give me a home among the gum trees, with lots of plum trees,\"\n\"A dog or two and a barbecue, flowers down the side,\" \n\"And veggies by the fence, all in Burke's Backyard\"\n\nThe television show was consistently a very strong ratings performer for the Nine Network. It occupied the Friday 7:30–8:30 timeslot for 17 years. During its final year, however, it rated poorly and was 'rested' by the Nine Network.\n\nIn the Spring special return in 2007, the show posted a very encouraging 10th place in the week's shows. It defeated both of its competing Seven Network shows including \"Australia's Best Backyards\" and \"Hot Property\", and was the most watched Nine Network show of the week.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2237973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237973", "title": "Gilbert Bates", "text": "Gilbert Bates\n\nGilbert Henderson Bates (February 13, 1836 – February 17, 1917) was an American soldier best known for his peaceful postwar marches, first throughout the American South and through England. For each endeavor, Bates wanted to prove that he would be treated cordially in regions supposedly hostile to Americans and found himself warmly welcomed by the natives.\nBates was born in Springwater, Livingston County, New York. He died in 1917 and was buried in Saybrook, Illinois. Before the American Civil War, Bates was a farmer in the town of Albion, near Edgerton, Wisconsin. During the war, he served as a sergeant in the 1st Wisconsin Heavy Artillery Regiment. After the war, he returned to his farm. In November 1867, during the period known as Reconstruction, Bates had a conversation about the South with a neighbor, who said, \"Sergeant, the Southerners are rebels yet. They are worse now than they were during the war. They hate the Union flag. No man dare show that flag anywhere in the South except in the presence of our soldiers.\" Bates replied, \"You are mistaken. I can carry that flag myself from the Mississippi all over the rebel States, alone and unarmed, too.\" Thus began his march, reported at the time in numerous local and national newspapers, but now largely forgotten.\n\nOn February 27, 1868, Mark Twain published the following in the \"Territorial Enterprise\": \nSergeant Gilbert H. Bates of Wisconsin is the last candidate for pedestrian notoriety. He has made a bet that he will walk, alone, unarmed, and without a cent in his pocket, and bearing aloft the American flag, through the late Southern Confederacy, from Vicksburg to Washington. He is already on his way, and the telegraph is noting his progress. The Mayor and a large portion of the population of Vicksburg ushered him out of that city with a grand demonstration. He proposes to sell photographs of himself at 25 cent apiece, all along his route, and convert the proceeds into a fund to be devoted to the aid and comfort of widows and orphans of soldiers who fought in the late war, irrespective of flag or politics. And then, I suppose, when he gets a good round sum together for the widows and orphans, he will hang up his flag and go and have a champagne blow-out. I don't believe in people who collect money for benevolent purposes and don't charge for it. I don't have full confidence in people who walk a thousand miles for the benefit of widows and orphans and don't get a cent for it. I question the uprightness of people who peddle their own photographs, anyhow, whether they carry flags or not. In my opinion a man might as well start his name with an initial and spell his middle name out and hope to be virtuous. But this fellow will get more black eyes, down there among those unreconstructed rebels than he can ever carry along with him without breaking his back. I expect to see him coming into Washington some day on one leg and with one eye out and an arm gone. He won't amount to more than an interesting relic by the time he gets here and then he will have to hire out for a sign for the Anatomical Museum. Those fellows down there have no sentiment in them. They won't buy his picture. They will be more likely to take his scalp.\nBates won his bet. During a three-month \"march\", which started in Vicksburg where he was welcomed by the mayor, he walked across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia to Washington, carrying the Stars and Stripes, and he was granted hospitality all along the way. He recorded his journey in a pamphlet published in June 1868 titled \"The Triumphal March of Sergeant Bates from Vicksburg to Washington\". In an irony of the times, although he was allowed to raise his flag over numerous official buildings in the South, including the state Capitol in Richmond, he was not granted permission to fly it at the Capitol in Washington.\n\nLater, a wealthy friend of Bates's wagered $1,000 against $100 that Bates could not march the length of England carrying the Stars and Stripes without being insulted. This was due to the idea that many English supported the Confederacy during the Civil War because of cotton exports. On November 5, 1872, Bates, in full military uniform, began a march from the Scottish border to London. Throughout his travels in England, he was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and kindness of the villagers. Hoteliers refused to let him pay; people fought to feed him. By the end of November, he had reached London, but the crowds were so great he had to be driven in an open carriage to the Guildhall, where he ceremoniously hung the unsullied Stars and Stripes next to the Union Jack. Upon reaching London, Bates telegrammed his friend, \"Cancel wager. I regard this mission as something finer than a matter of money.\"\n\nIn September 2003, a dramatization of Bates's story titled \"The Saga of Sergeant Bates: the Most Sensational March in American History\", by John Nicholas Schweitzer, was commissioned by John Vorndran and produced for the Edgerton (Wisconsin) bicentennial.\n\n"}

He played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1949 and 1960 for the Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers, Washington Senators, New York Giants, and Kansas City Athletics.\n\nAfter growing up in Michigan, Terwilliger joined the Marines in 1943 following his 18th birthday and served as a radioman on an amphibious tank in the Pacific Theater of World War II. While overseas, Corporal Terwilliger participated in the invasions of Tinian and Iwo Jima, and had his tank knocked out at Saipan. \"\"We were hit and the tank bogged down,\"\" he told The Sporting News on April 26, 1950. \"\"We had to abandon the tank. Everybody scattered into the nearest fox holes. But at just about that time a Jap tank rolled up and began blasting away. I knew I had to get out of there, so I ran for the beach, zigzagging in and out with the tank chasing me. I'm sure I'd be lying out there somewhere now, if it hadn't been for one of our own tanks, which luckily showed up while I was doing all that broken field running. They knocked out the Jap tank.\"\"\n\nTerwilliger was discharged in late 1945 and attended Western Michigan College where he quickly became a star shortstop. As early as 1946, he was attracting attention from major league scouts and St Louis Browns’ scout Jack Fournier, was particularly keen to sign him.\n\nIn , after finishing college, Terwilliger was playing second base with the semi-pro Benton Harbor Buds when he was signed as a free agent in July by the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs assigned him to the Single-A Des Moines Bruins of the Western League where he finished the season. In 1949, Terwilliger was promoted to the AAA Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, where he batted .275 in 115 games, before being called up to the Cubs in August and playing in 36 games. Terwilliger spent the 1950 season as the Cubs' starting second baseman, hitting .242 with 10 home runs, 32 RBI, and 13 stolen bases. However, after getting off to a poor start to the 1951 season, Terwilliger was included in a trade that sent outfielder Andy Pafko, pitcher Johnny Schmitz, and catcher Rube Walker to the Brooklyn Dodgers for catcher Bruce Edwards, pitcher Joe Hatten, outfielder Gene Hermanski and infielder Eddie Miksis.\n\nAfter spending the 1952 season with the AAA St. Paul Saints, Terwilliger was claimed off waivers by the Washington Senators following the 1952 season and spent the next two seasons as the Senators' second baseman. Prior to the start of the 1955 season, Terwilliger switched teams again after the New York Giants purchased him from the Senators. He spent the 1955 and '56 seasons shuttling between New York and AAA Minneapolis and the entire 1957 season at AAA. Following the 1957 season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a swap for fellow journeymen infielder Jack Dittmer.\n\nAfter spending 1958 with the Tigers' AAA Charleston Senators, he was acquired by the Kansas City A's from the Detroit Tigers in the December 1958 Rule 5 draft. In 1959, Terwilliger saw his last large stretch of time in the majors, playing 74 games at second and shortstop for the A's. After starting the 1960 season with the A's, Terwilliger was unofficially traded to the New York Yankees, a transaction that was common at the time between the two teams when the Yankees were accused of using the A's as a major league farm club and the two teams often seemed to have mutual rights to each other's players, and played the rest of the season at AAA Richmond Virginians before retiring as a full-time player.\n\nAfter his playing days were over, Terwilliger started a successful career as coach and minor-league manager in the Yankees' organization with the Greensboro Yankees of the B-level Carolina League. After taking the 1962 season off, Terwilliger would be hired by the Washington Senators to manage their single-A team, the Wisconsin Rapids Senators in the Midwest League. He would spend the following six seasons managing in the Senators organization, the last two at AAA.\n\nUnder manager Ted Williams, Terwilliger was the third-base coach of the Senators from 1969 to 1971 and of the Texas Rangers in their first season, 1972. Following the season, Terwilliger was let go by the Rangers, following Williams' retirement, and would manage the Houston Astros' AA Columbus Astros in 1973 and Texas' single-A Lynchburg Rangers in 1975 before spending the next four seasons managing the single-A Asheville Tourists. In 1980, he was hired as the manager of Texas' AA Tulsa Drillers. \n\nTerwilliger returned as a major league coach after being hired to Don Zimmer's 1981 Rangers staff and would stay with the team for four years. He would coach first for Zimmer, and then Darrell Johnson, Doug Rader, and Bobby Valentine. In 1986, he was hired as first-base coach on Ray Miller's Minnesota Twins staff. He would stay on with rookie manager Tom Kelly, handling the job when the team won the World Series in 1987 and 1991 before leaving following the 1994 season.\n\nStaying in Minnesota, in 1995 Terwilliger returned to the St. Paul Saints, this time as the manager of the team in the independent Northern League. He would remain with the team until 2002. \n\nIn 2003, he would be named manager of the Fort Worth Cats in the independent Central Baseball League, and won the Central League championship. After retiring from managing following the end of the 2005 season, Terwilliger accepted the position as first base coach for the Cats, at the age of 81, and remains with team in the new American Association through the 2010 season.\n\nThroughout his career, Terwilliger managed 12 minor-league teams and compiled a record of 1,224 wins and 1,089 losses. In 2006, Terwilliger's autobiography, \"Terwilliger Bunts One\", was released.\n\n"}

The area is sometimes referred to as the \"Lake Las Vegas Resort\". It is being developed by 5 companies including Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC.\n\nThe area includes three resorts including the Aston MonteLago Village Resort, the Westin Lake Las Vegas Resort, and the Hilton Lake Las Vegas.\n\nThe dam that creates the lake is \"an earthen structure 18 stories high, in length and wide at its base. It contains roughly the same amount of dirt as Hoover Dam does concrete,\" and was completed in 1991. The Las Vegas Wash passes under the lake and dam in pipes that require maintenance every 10 years.\n\nActor J. Carlton Adair conceived Lake Las Vegas around 1967 as \"Lake Adair\". At the time he purchased the land and water rights. In 1987, Ronald Boeddeker acquired from the US Government when Adair went bankrupt. The property was acquired by Transcontinental Properties in 1990. That same year, of water was diverted from nearby Lake Mead to fill the lake. The lake was built on top of the Las Vegas Wash, which continues to flow under the lake in two diameter pipes. In 1995, Henry Gluck, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Caesars World, became the co-Chairman of Transcontinental Properties. With Sid Bass and Lee Bass, two billionaires from Fort Worth, Texas, he developed the new community. The project cost US $5 billion.\n\nLake at Las Vegas Joint Venture, LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 17, 2008. Debts were estimated at between $500 million and $1 billion. Lake Las Vegas emerged from bankruptcy in July 2010 with a plan that took nearly two years to complete. All existing debt was wiped away and the development has $30 million in hand to complete several of the unfinished infrastructure projects. The Lake Las Vegas bankruptcy creditors, not Lake Las Vegas development themselves, have filed a lawsuit against the former insiders (Bass Brothers, TransContinental, etc.). The creditors' theory is that the $500 million equity loan the former insiders took against the property caused the demise of Lake Las Vegas. The creditors are hoping to recoup money from the former insiders. In a related action, resort property owners are suing lender Credit Suisse as part of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit led by bankrupt Yellowstone Club founder Timothy Blixseth and his son Beau Blixseth who claim the Lake Las Vegas Joint Venture bankruptcy was caused by a \"loan to own\" scheme between the bank and resort developers. The golf course was purchased by Nevada South Shore LLC, a Hawaii-based corporation for $4.5 million on February 17, 2011. The Ritz Carlton, Lake Las Vegas, closed after 8 years of operation on May 2, 2010. The Ritz Carlton was then reopened by international boutique hotelier Dolce Hotels on February 11, 2011, as the Ravella at Lake Las Vegas. On April 30, 2013, Kam Sang Co. announced that the Ravella would be renamed the Hilton Lake Las Vegas, the name under which the hotel continues to operate. The Hilton opened June 6, 2013.\n\nLake Las Vegas was the subject of a lawsuit between investment fund Claymore Holdings and Credit Suisse, which was the agent for a syndicate of entities that loaned $540 million to develop the property. Claymore and others accused Credit Suisse of fraudulently inflating the value of the development in order to generate higher fees for itself. The core of the allegations centered on a new appraisal methodology conceived of by Credit Suisse executive David Miller, who in internal emails is referred to as Credit Suisse's Dr. Frankenstein. In 2015, a Texas judge ordered Credit Suisse to pay $288 million to Highland, Claymore and others. The verdict was partially offset by other payments to Highland, meaning that Claymore received most of the Credit Suisse judgment. That Judgment was reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in April 2020, and Claymore's Judgment was reduced to $26 million (plus interest).\n\nCasino MonteLago was opened on May 8, 2003, having been built by Cook Inlet Region, Inc., an Alaska Native shareholder owned corporation. The casino closed for the first time on March 14, 2010, due to the Great Recession; but on May 26, 2011, after renovation, the casino re-opened to the public. In November 2012, the casino was acquired along with the Ravella at Lake Las Vegas for a total of $47 million by Kam Sang Co., a California-based real estate developer. The casino closed for the second time on October 29, 2013, as a result of a lease dispute between Kam Sang and the casino's operators.

From 2014 to 2019, Barnes played Magda Andel in the CW comedy-drama series, \"Jane the Virgin\".\n\nBarnes was born December 7, 1954 (some sources list 1952 or 1955) in Fort Dix, New Jersey, the third of four children of a father who was a major in the United States Air Force and her mother a homemaker. Her childhood was marked by a series of moves across various military bases in the United States before her family settled in Lancaster, California. After graduating from Antelope Valley High School at age 17, she relocated to San Diego, working as a waitress and a dancer.\n\nBarnes' first break came when Bob Hope saw her in a local fashion show and invited her to join his troupe for a 1973 performance at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. She subsequently moved to Los Angeles to attempt a career in show business in earnest. She appeared as an Amazon in \"The New Original Wonder Woman\" alongside Lynda Carter as the title character.

{"id": "2238017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238017", "title": "1981 Major League Baseball strike", "text": "1981 Major League Baseball strike\n\nThe 1981 Major League Baseball strike was the first work stoppage in Major League Baseball since the 1972 Major League Baseball strike that resulted in regular season games being cancelled. Overall, it was the fourth work stoppage since 1972, but actions in 1973, 1976, and 1980 did not result in any regular season games being cancelled. The strike began on June 12 and forced the cancellation of 713 games (or 38 percent of the Major League schedule) in the middle of the regular season. The two sides reached an agreement on July 31, and play resumed on August 9 with the All-Star Game, with regular season play resuming one day later.\n\nAn estimated US$146 million was lost in player salaries, ticket sales, broadcast revenues, and concession revenues. The players lost $4 million a week in salaries while the owners suffered a total loss of $72 million.\n\nThe Executive Board of the Major League Baseball Players Association voted unanimously to strike on May 29 due to the unresolved issue of free agent compensation. The deadline was extended briefly, however, after the Players' Association's unfair labor complaint was heard by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe strike was called in response to the owners wanting to win back the prerogatives over the players. The owners had already lost at the bargaining table and in the courts on the issue of the free agency draft. At issue during the seven-week-long negotiations was the owners demanding compensation for losing a free agent player to another team. The compensation in question was a player who was selected from the signing team's roster (not including 12 \"protected\" players). The players maintained that any form of compensation would undermine the value of free agency.\n\nAlthough the strike was called by the players, many sportswriters and even fans placed most of the blame on the owners. \"Sports Illustrated\" reflected this particular opinion with the cover headline \"Strike! The Walkout the Owners Provoked.\" One of the reasons the owners doled out such hefty contracts from 1978–1981 (43 players each negotiated contracts worth over $1 million during this period) was that they were afraid of losing disgruntled stars in the free agency reentry draft. So the owners paid their players the so-called new going rate in order to keep them from going elsewhere.\n\nReporters used Strat-O-Matic to simulate the delayed 1981 All-Star game inside Cleveland Stadium, with the scoreboard displaying the game's progress; the Strat-O-Matic set went to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Some newspapers used Strat-O-Matic to simulate other canceled games during the strike.\n\nOn July 31, 1981, a compromise was reached. In the settlement, teams that lost a \"premium\" free agent could be compensated by drawing from a pool of players left unprotected from all of the clubs rather than just the signing club. Players agree to restricting free agency to players with six or more years of major league service. The settlement gave the owners a limited victory on the compensation issue.\n\nReportedly, the negotiations were so bitter that when a settlement was finally reached, Players Association representative Marvin Miller and the owners' negotiator Ray Grebey refused to pose with each other for the traditional \"peace ceremony\" photograph.\n\nMajor League Baseball resumed on August 9 with the All-Star Game in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium. The All-Star Game, which was originally scheduled to be held on July 14, now served as a prelude to play resuming on August 10. The National League beat the American League 5-4.\n\nWhen play resumed, attendance dropped in 17 of 24 cities and television ratings slumped sharply. Despite the disgruntled fans, the All-Star Game, which was played on a Sunday instead of the usual Tuesday, had its largest attendance (72,086), due to the large seating capacity of Municipal Stadium.\n\nDue to the two-month strike, the owners tried to create an equitable solution. So on August 6, the owners decided to split the 1981 season into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a wild card team if the same club won both halves) meeting in a best-of-five divisional playoff series (this playoff round, known as the League Division Series was a one-off for this season; it wasn't until 13 years later in 1994 that the LDS round would become permanent in MLB [it was first played in 1995, as the 1994 season was ended due to another strike], when the league introduced the three-division format). The four survivors would then move on to the two best-of-five League Championship Series. It was the first time that Major League Baseball used a split-season format since 1892.\n\nThe split-season idea as put into practice (although garnering the league more playoff revenue) seemed to cheapen the results of the regular season. As first proposed, if a team won its division in both halves of the season, then it would play the team with the second best record overall (first and second half). An Orioles fan, J. Thomas Codd, pointed out that the arrangement would give a team with a good overall record an incentive to lose games against the first-half winner to help a division rival win both halves. On August 20, Major League Baseball revised the rules so that if a team won both halves of the season, it would face the second season runner-up instead.\n\nFacing a playoff no matter their finish in the second half, the first-half winners lacked incentive (as opposed to the minor leagues, where if the same team did win both halves it was given a bye into the next round) to repeat, and finished the second half of the season with a composite record of only three games above .500. To make matters worse, the Cincinnati Reds (National League West) and St. Louis Cardinals (National League East) each failed to make the playoffs. This was despite the fact that they had the two best full-season records in the National League that season (and thus would have won their divisions under normal circumstances). The Cardinals would receive some vindication the following year when they won the World Series while the Reds would not make the postseason again until 1990, when they won the franchise's most recent World Series title. \n\nIn contrast to the Reds' and Cardinals' bad luck, the defending American League champion Kansas City Royals made the postseason despite owning the fourth-best full-season record in their division and posting a losing record overall (50–53). Notably, the format allowed the second-half National League East champion Montreal Expos to make the playoffs, the only time the Expos franchise would make the postseason in their 36-year stay in Montreal and their only postseason appearance of any kind until 2012, long after the team became the Washington Nationals. Ironically, the next time there would be a significant players' strike, 13 years later in 1994, the Expos would be end up being the team most hurt by the season's abrupt end.\n\nThe Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates ended up playing the fewest games of any team at 102. Meanwhile, the San Francisco Giants played the most at 111. Most teams finished with anywhere between 106 and 109 games.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2238022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238022", "title": "Krypton fluoride laser", "text": "Krypton fluoride laser\n\nA krypton fluoride laser (KrF laser) is a particular type of excimer laser, which is sometimes (more correctly) called an exciplex laser. With its 248 nanometer wavelength, it is a deep ultraviolet laser which is commonly used in the production of semiconductor integrated circuits, industrial micromachining, and scientific research. The term excimer is short for 'excited dimer', while exciplex is short for 'excited complex'. An excimer laser typically contains a mixture of: a noble gas such as argon, krypton, or xenon; and a halogen gas such as fluorine or chlorine. Under suitably intense conditions of electromagnetic stimulation and pressure, the mixture emits a beam of coherent stimulated radiation as laser light in the ultraviolet range.\n\nKrF and ArF excimer lasers are widely incorporated into high-resolution photolithography machines, one of the critical tools required for microelectronic chip manufacturing in nanometer dimensions. Excimer laser lithography has enabled transistor feature sizes to shrink from 800 nanometers in 1990 to 10 nanometers in 2016.\n\nA krypton fluoride laser absorbs energy from a source, causing the krypton gas to react with the fluorine gas producing the exciplex krypton fluoride, a temporary complex in an excited energy state:\n\nThe complex can undergo spontaneous or stimulated emission, reducing its energy state to a metastable, but highly repulsive ground state. The ground state complex quickly dissociates into unbound atoms:\n\nThe result is an exciplex laser which radiates energy at 248 nm, near the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, corresponding with the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the complex.\n\nThe most widespread industrial application of KrF excimer lasers has been in deep-ultraviolet photolithography for the manufacturing of microelectronic devices (i.e., semiconductor integrated circuits or “chips”). From the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, Hg-Xe lamps had been used for lithography at 436, 405 and 365 nm wavelengths. However, with the semiconductor industry's need for both finer resolution (for denser and faster chips) and higher production throughput (for lower costs), the lamp-based lithography tools were no longer able to meet the industry's requirements. This challenge was overcome when in a pioneering development in 1982, deep-UV excimer laser lithography was demonstrated at IBM by K. Jain. With phenomenal advances made in equipment and technology in the last two decades, modern semiconductor electronic devices fabricated using excimer laser lithography now total more than $400 billion in annual production. As a result, it is the semiconductor industry view that excimer laser lithography (with both KrF and ArF lasers) has been a crucial factor in the predictive power of Moore's law. From an even broader scientific and technological perspective: since the invention of the laser in 1960, the development of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones in the 50-year history of the laser.\n\nThe KrF laser has been of utility in the nuclear fusion energy research community in inertial confinement experiments. This laser has high beam uniformity, short wavelength, and the feature of an adjustable spot size.\n\nIn 1985 the Los Alamos National Laboratory completed a test firing of an experimental KrF laser with an energy level of 1.0 × 10 joules. The Laser Plasma Branch of the Naval Research Laboratory completed a KrF laser called the \"Nike laser\" that can produce about 4.5 × 10 joules of UV energy output in a 4 nanosecond pulse. Kent A. Gerber was the driving force behind this project. The latter laser is being used in laser confinement experiments.\n\nThis laser has also been used to produce soft X-ray emission from a plasma, through irradiation by brief pulses of this laser light. Other important applications include manipulating of various materials such as plastic, glass, crystal, composite materials and living tissue. The light from this UV laser is strongly absorbed by lipids, nucleic acids and proteins, making it useful for applications in medical therapy and surgery.\n\nThe light emitted by the KrF is invisible to the human eye, so additional safety precautions are necessary when working with this laser to avoid stray beams. Gloves are needed to protect the flesh from the potentially carcinogenic properties of the UV beam, and UV goggles are needed to protect the eyes.\n\n\n"}

A member of the Republican Party, he served as lieutenant governor of Idaho from 2003 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2009, and as governor of Idaho from 2006 to 2007.\n\nRisch was a prosecuting attorney and taught criminal law. With a net worth of $15.6 million, he is one of the wealthiest members of the Senate.\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Risch is the son of Helen B. (née Levi) and Elroy A. Risch, a lineman for Wisconsin Bell. His father was of German descent and his mother of Irish, Scottish, and English ancestry. Risch attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee from 1961 to 1963 and then transferred to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He obtained a B.S. degree in forestry in 1965, and continued his education at the university's College of Law. He served on the Law Review and the College of Law Advisory Committee before receiving a J.D. degree in 1968.\n\nRisch entered politics in 1970 in Boise at age 27, winning election as Ada County Prosecuting Attorney. While serving in this capacity, he taught undergraduate classes in criminal justice at Boise State College and served as the president of the state's prosecuting attorneys' association. Concurrent with his service in the Idaho Senate, Risch became a millionaire as one of Idaho's most successful trial lawyers.\n\nRisch was first elected to the Idaho Senate from Ada County in 1974. He entered the state senate leadership in 1976, serving as majority leader and later as president pro tempore.\n\nIn a dramatic upset, Risch was defeated for reelection in 1988 by Democratic political newcomer and Boise attorney Mike Burkett. As of mid-2006, it remains Idaho's most expensive legislative contest.\n\nIn the second political defeat of his career, Risch lost the 1994 primary election for a state Senate seat to Roger Madsen. Risch returned to the state senate in 1995, as an appointee of Governor Phil Batt, who had named Madsen as the state commerce department's director.\n\nIn January 2001, Risch had his eye on the lieutenant governor's seat vacated by Butch Otter, who resigned after being elected to Congress, but Governor Dirk Kempthorne appointed state Senator Jack Riggs of Coeur d'Alene to the post instead. The next year, Risch defeated Riggs in the Republican primary and won the general election, spending $360,000 of his own money on the campaign.\n\nOn May 26, 2006, Risch became governor of Idaho when Kempthorne resigned to become U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Risch appointed Mark Ricks to serve as his lieutenant governor. Risch served out the remaining seven months of Kempthorne's term, which ended in January 2007.\n\nIn August 2006, Risch called a special session of the Idaho Legislature to consider his proposed property tax reform bill, the Property Tax Relief Act of 2006.\n\nRisch was expected to enter the 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary to succeed Kempthorne, who was completing his second term at this time of his federal appointment. But Otter had already announced his candidacy for the position in December 2004 and gained a significant head start in campaigning and fundraising. In November 2005, Risch announced his intention to seek election again as lieutenant governor.\n\nRisch was unopposed for the 2006 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor and defeated former Democratic U.S. representative Larry LaRocco in the general election. Risch's term as governor ended in January 2007 and he returned to the role of lieutenant governor. He resigned as lieutenant governor to take his seat in the Senate on January 3, 2009. Otter named state Senator Brad Little of Emmett as Risch's successor.\n\n2008\n\nOn August 31, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Governor Otter might appoint Risch to the United States Senate to succeed the embattled Larry Craig. On September 1, the \"Idaho Statesman\" reported that Otter's spokesman denied Risch had been selected and that Otter had \"made no decision and he is not leaning toward anybody.\" On October 9, Risch announced that he would run for the Senate seat. In May 2008, Risch was nominated as the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. In the general election he defeated former Democratic Congressman Larry LaRocco with 58% of the vote.\n\n2014\n\nRisch won the Republican primary with 79.9% of the vote and defeated attorney Nels Mitchell in the general election with 65.3% of the vote.\n\nRisch was one of four freshmen Republican Senators in the 111th Congress of 2009, with Mike Johanns of Nebraska, George LeMieux of Florida and Scott Brown of Massachusetts. Republican Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho called Risch \"results-oriented\".\n\nIn 2017, Risch was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.\n\nOn August 11, 2017, in an interview on the PBS Newshour, Risch endorsed Trump's threatening North Korea with military destruction in the event that country launched missiles at Guam.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, the day before a potential federal government shutdown, Risch threatened to block a government spending bill because it included changing the name of the White Clouds Wilderness protected area to honor a deceased political rival, former Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus. Risch ultimately acquiesced.\n\nIn January 2019, Risch joined Marco Rubio, Cory Gardner, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in introducing legislation that would impose sanctions on the government of President of Syria Bashar al-Assad and bolster American cooperation with Israel and Jordan.\n\nOn January 21, 2020, during the first day of opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Risch was the first senator to fall asleep. His nap was memorialized by courtroom sketch artist Art Lien.\n\n\n\nRisch is anti-abortion. In 2013, he co-sponsored the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which would have made it illegal for a minor to cross state lines for an abortion.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) endorsed Risch and gave him an A+ grade for his voting record on gun issues.\n\nIn 2013, along with 12 other Republican Senators, Risch threatened to filibuster any bills Democrats introduced that Republicans perceived as a threat to gun rights, including expanded background checks. In an interview with National Public Radio, he said that Americans' right to keep and bear arms includes \"a right to purchase one [a gun], to sell one, to trade in one, and you really have to have a robust market if indeed you're going to have a constitutional right.\" He also said that additional background checks would mean that gun dealers would \"have to deal with the federal bureaucracy, which is very, very difficult to deal with.\"\n\nIn response to the Orlando nightclub shooting, Risch and Crapo said the shooting was not a reason to call for gun-control legislation.\n\nIn 2016, Risch voted against the Feinstein Amendment, which would have blocked the sale of guns to people on the terrorist watch list, and Democrat Chris Murphy's proposal to expand background checks for sales at gun shows and online. Risch voted for both Republican-backed bills, John Cornyn's proposal to create a 72-hour delay for anyone on the terrorist watchlist buying a gun and Charles Grassley and Ted Cruz's proposal to alert authorities if a someone on the list tries to buy a firearm.\n\nIn response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Risch said \"Today is a sad day for all Americans. Vicki and I are praying for the victims of this horrible event and for their families. As usual, our first responders reacted in their typical heroic fashion.\"\n\nRisch opposed the FIRST STEP Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. The bill passed 87-12 on December 18, 2018.\n\nRisch supports repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. He voted against the ACA in 2010.\n\nIn 2019, Risch sought to quell dissent among Republican senators over what they perceived as the Trump administration's weak response to the killing of Saudi journalist and U.S. permanent resident Jamal Khashoggi, and its refusal to send Congress a report on the administration's determination of who killed Khashoggi. Risch told his fellow Republican senators and \"Politico\" that the Trump administration was in compliance with the Magnitsky Act, but the administration had stated that it refused to comply with the Magnitsky Act.\n\nIn March 2018, Risch co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.\n\nRisch is a co-sponsor of S.1241, the Promoting American National Security and Preventing the Resurgence of ISIS Act of 2019, which is intended to punish Turkey and protect allies like the Kurds who have suffered from recent Turkish military operations in Syria, including by resettling them in the United States. The measure has broad support in Congress, which is concerned about the purchase of the Russian S-400missile system Turkey is currently testing.\n\n"}

It is mandated by the government to act as its agent for the disposal of such assets, and the government is the company's only shareholder. The necessity of the disposition of land and other physical assets was the result of the privatization of Canadian National Railway in 1995, as the government had excluded non-rail real estate assets from the privatization and re-activated Canada Lands as a holding company for these assets, and to dispose of high-value assets in urban areas. Any property deemed surplus by the government must be sold to the Canada Lands Company at fair market value, which it must then develop, manage, or sell.\n\nThe chair of the company and its board members are appointed by the Governor-in-Council. It is a self-financing company operated at arm's length from the government that reports to the Minister of the Environment. It functions as a \"private sector, full-service real estate company\".

{"id": "2238101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238101", "title": "Two-stroke power valve system", "text": "Two-stroke power valve system\n\nThe two-stroke power valve system is an improvement to a conventional two-stroke engine that gives a high power output over a wider RPM range.\n\nA \"stroke\" is the action of a piston travelling the full length of its cylinder. In a two-stroke engine, one of the two strokes combines the intake stroke and the compression stroke, while the other stroke combines the combustion stroke and the exhaust stroke.\n\nAs the piston travels upward in the cylinder, it creates low pressure area in the crankcase; this draws fresh air and atomized fuel from the carburetor through a hole in the cylinder wall or directly into the crankcase. As the piston continues travelling upward, transfer ports and the exhaust ports are closed off, thus trapping the combustible mixture in the combustion chamber. As the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the mixture in the cylinder is compressed to the point of ignition. \n\nThe second stroke begins once ignition has taken place. The power stroke begins after the air-fuel mixture is ignited. The burnt fuel creates pressure in the cylinder above the piston and forces it downward. As the piston passes the midpoint of the downstroke, the exhaust port to the side of the cylinder is uncovered and initiates the flow of burned fuel out into the expansion chamber or muffler through the manifold.\n\nThe piston then moves downward, where the air-fuel mixture remains from the previous intake-compression stroke. Shortly after the exhaust port is uncovered by the downward travel of the piston, the transfer ports begin to be uncovered. The transfer ports act as a passage through which the air-fuel mixture moves from the crankcase into the cylinder above the piston. Once the piston reaches the bottom of the stroke, the second stroke is completed and the process is repeated.\n\nThe only moving parts inside simple two-stroke engines are the crankshaft, the connecting rod, and the piston. It is the same simplicity in design, however, that causes a two-stroke engine to be less fuel-efficient and produce high specific levels of undesirable exhaust gas emissions. At the bottom of the power stroke, the transfer ports, which deliver fresh fuel-air mixture, are open at the same time as the exhaust port. This can allow a significant amount of fresh fuel to run straight through the engine without being burned in the process of power production. Properly designed exhaust systems help minimize the amount of raw fuel loss in the exhaust process, but a carbureted two-stroke engine will always waste some fuel (modern direct injected engines avoid this).\n\nMany producers of two-stroke performance bikes fit them with the exhaust power valve systems. These valves act to vary the height (and width) of the exhaust port thereby broadening power delivery over a wider rev range. Exhaust ports with fixed dimensions only produce usable power in a narrow rev range, which also affects fuel consumption and emissions. \n\nIn a race bike, this is not a problem as the engine will be operating at high RPM almost all the time. However, in a road/commuter bike, the limited power range is a problem. To provide more low RPM power, as well as enable the engine to produce a lot of high RPM power, a power valve system is used. \n\nAll power valve systems vary the duration of the exhaust port open time, which gives the engine usable low end power combined with excellent top end power. Manufacturers have also included sub exhaust chambers that extend the 'tuned length' of the expansion chamber. \n\nPower valve actuation can be by mechanical (RPM dependent) or electric (servo motor) means increasingly with electronic control. Electronic control offers a greater degree of accuracy as well as being able to vary the opening of the valve and be tuned to conditions.\n\nAETC and Super AETC Suzuki engines, Automatic Exhaust Timing Control: The two-blade version was fitted to the VJ21 RGV250, and the three-blade version, to the VJ22 RGV250 and Suzuki RG150.\n\nWith the AETC system, the power-valve systems are normally partially closed at low RPM; when closed, it enables the engine to make more power. Up to a certain point, however, power drops off as the engine is unable to expel enough gases out of the exhaust. When the power-valve is opened, it allows more gases to flow out of the exhaust port. This system is recognizable by a small box above the exhaust outlet; the power-valves are situated in this box. Depending on the valve, they may be made of two (older version) or three (newer version) separate blades.\n\nYPVS Yamaha engines, Yamaha Power Valve System: Yamaha engineers realized that by altering the height of the exhaust port they could effectively change the engine power delivery thereby having optimal power and torque across the entire rev range, so it was that the YPVS was born. The valve is of a cylindrical \"cotton reel\" design running across the top of the exhaust port, it is turned by a servo motor controlled from a control box taking information from the CDI (and other locations). The valve is a slightly oval shape. This changes the height and size of the exhaust port at different engine speeds, maximizing the available power at all rev ranges, opening up firstly at 3k rpm for low end power, gradually in between 3-6k, fully opening at 6k rpm for maximum power, on most 125cc. It was fitted to all of the later models of the RZ/RD two-stroke road bikes (125, 250, 350 and 500 cc), the TZR range. It was also added to the DT(125lc 2/3) range after 1984 (but was locked closed to comply with UK learner regulations until the (R) in 1988-04 which had a fully functional YPVS valve) the DT125R has a better design of engine, although not much altered in speed, just more reliable than its predecessor. The YZ series of motocross bikes has a mechanical power valve which is activated at RPM speed. The YPVS is only found on the liquid-cooled bikes not air cooled versions. Yamaha have also used a guillotine version in some of their later models such as the 1994 TZR250 3XV SP model, and many later TZ road race bikes. The TZR250R 3XV SPR actually uses a Triple-YPVS, which is a combination of the guillotine and \"cotton reel\" designs.\n\nYamaha was actually the first company to produce consistent results with their YPVS in their race bikes. The 1977 OW35K was the first race bike to incorporate the power valve system and it won the Finnish GP in 1977. The Kadenacy effect was harnessed and controlled to a point that gave Yamaha great advantage over all the other manufacturers throughout the late '70s and into the mid '80s. The first street bikes with YPVS were the RZ/RD350 YPVS (LC2-onwards), and RZ/RD500 GP Replica in 1983-84.\n\nATAC System: The Honda Automatic Torque Amplification Chamber system works by effectively increasing or decreasing the volume of the exhaust system with a small butterfly valve located just before the exhaust connection. At low RPM a centrifugal crankshaft driven gear opens the valve into a small chamber and increases the volume of the exhaust by allowing the exhaust gases to flow through the chamber. At high RPM the ATAC valve is closed and the exhaust simply exits into the expansion chamber. A larger expansion chamber allows for more power at lower RPMs because of the extra time needed for the impulse to \"bounce\" back for the supercharger effect. It was used on their CR motocrossers, GP bikes and MTX, MVX, NS and NSR road bikes.\n\nHPP valve. A centrifugal governor opens and closes a two-blade exhaust valve (using over 50 parts)\n\nThe \"V-TACS\" - Variable Torque Amplification Chamber System - works differently from the \"ATAC system\" and it will only work when it is used in conjunction with a tuned muffler. Tuned mufflers/expansion chambers increase power but only at the RPM they are designed for and can actually cause a power loss outside their tuned RPM. \"V-TACS system\" takes advantage of using an expansion chamber without losing power outside the expansion chamber's tuned RPM. Within the head and cylinder of the engine, there is a chamber that is sealed by a valve. This sealed chamber is vented onto the exhaust port when the valve is open. At low RPM this valve is open, this has the effect of increasing the exhaust manifold volume and negating the power loss that would normally be apparent at low RPM with an expansion chamber. At mid RPM the valve is closed, this enables the expansion chamber to work. It is identified by the head and cylinder, being much larger than normal for its displacement, the cylinder wall is also cast with the wording VTACS on it. \n\nV-TACS was a foot-operated power valve system made by Honda on some of its small two-stroke bikes and scooters, like the Honda FC50.\n\nThe Honda Revolution Control valve is designed and works in principle like the \"AETC system.\" A small computer monitors engine RPM and adjusts a two-blade exhaust valve with an electric servo. Honda equipped many two-stroke motorcycles such as the NSR125 and NSR250 models with RC - Valve power plants.\n\nKawasaki uses a power-valve system called KIPS (Kawasaki Integrated Powervalve System) on their two-stroke bikes. The KIPS utilizes both alterations in port height, closing of the secondary port ducting, and a resonant chamber. KIPS is operated by a mechanical governor on single cylinder machines .The twin cylinder bikes have an electric motor transferring movement via cable and linkages.\n"}

He graduated from the School of Art in Niš. As an 18-year-old student he published his first book – \"On Writing as an Artistic, Historical, Social and Cultural Phenomenon\".\n\nHis academic career started in Belgrade where he received an MA in art history from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy. In 2004, he began writing his PhD thesis at the University of Freiburg, Germany under Prof. Dr. Angeli Janhsen. Džalto successfully defended his thesis in 2006, becoming the youngest doctor of philosophy in the humanities in Germany and Southeast Europe.\n\nSince 2007, he has been a university professor of history and theory of art and of Orthodox Christian theology and religious studies. He has taught at various universities in Europe and the US, including University of Prague, Indiana University, Fordham University in New York, the American University of Rome.\n\nHe was directly involved in many ecumenical and peace-building initiatives during his engagement in the Pax Christi office in Belgrade. He was a founding member and the art director of the \"Flexible Art Network\", dedicated to exploring relations between artworks, artists and the public, the president of the \"Institute for the Study of Culture and Christianity\" and the vice president of the \"Christian Cultural Center\", promoting creativity, critical thinking, inter-cultural, inter-religious and ecumenical dialogue.\n\nHis work is based on examination of the relations between personhood and authorship, especially in the postmodern and globalization context.\n\nHe contributed to the theory of creativity by exploring human creative capacities (most notably on the example of art) as an expression of the personal identity of the human being, having an existential importance. He was the first one to formulate a theological argument (from an Orthodox Christian perspective) based on his analysis of modern and contemporary art (in particular the work of Marcel Duchamp, Richard Long, Joseph Kosuth and Andy Warhol). That way he contributed to the revision of the postmodernism, actualizing the question of the possibility and meaning of (human) ontological freedom and creation.\n\nHe continued to further develop theological concepts of John Zizioulas and philosophical statements given by Nikolai Berdyaev, implementing them in the analysis of contemporary society. He also examines the concept of \"simulacrum\" in relation to the human person and its ability to create. Based on the \"Aesthetik der Absenz\", formulated in German-speaking art circles, he recognized and explained the phenomenon of \"absence of body\" in twentieth-century art.\n\nHe contributed to Christian and, specifically, Orthodox Christian political theology with his understanding of anarchism as a political philosophy which focuses on the affirmation of human freedom against any institution or exercise of power.

He was the nephew of the painter Aert Mijtens, the older brother of the painter Isaac Mijtens, and the father of the painter Daniel Mijtens the Younger. No known work survives from his first Dutch period.\n\nBy 1618, he had moved to London, where his initial patron was the leading art collector Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel. Mijtens painted the Earl and his Countess, and was soon commissioned to paint King James I and his son Charles, Prince of Wales. In 1625 he was speculated to have become Charles I's secret lover.\n\nAfter the prince's accession to the throne as Charles I in 1625 Mijtens produced such a large number of full-length portraits of Charles I and his courtiers, including duplicates, that it is assumed that he had workshop assistance. Two of his finest portraits are of the same man, James Hamilton later 1st Duke of Hamilton, whom he painted as a seventeen-year-old in 1623 and again in 1629. Mijtens made visits to the Netherlands in 1626 and 1630, perhaps to study the latest developments in his field, more particularly the works of Rubens and Van Dyck.\n\nMijtens introduced a new naturalism into the English court portrait, and influenced Abraham van Blyenberch, but after the arrival in England of the far more distinguished Anthony van Dyck in 1632 he was superseded as the leading court portraitist. Van Dyck demonstrated his superiority over Mytens by painting a portrait of the King and Queen, based on Mytens original, but better executed. Around 1634 Mytens appears to have returned to the Netherlands permanently. He subsequently worked primarily as an art dealer in The Hague, acquiring works for the Earl of Arundel among others. Only four paintings survive from this final period. He died in The Hague.\n\nSome of Mijtens' works are still owned by the Royal Family. Mijtens also made copies of old portraits of royal sitters, including; James IV of Scotland, his wife Margaret Tudor, and Mary, Queen of Scots. He also made a copy of a \"Venus\" by Titian for £120 in 1625.\n\n"}

The drama is based on \"Madman's Holiday\", a short-story written by mystery writer Fredric Brown. The drama features Pat O'Brien, Claire Trevor, Herbert Marshall, and others.\n\nArt critic and forgery expert George Steele (O'Brien) is stopped by a policeman as he breaks into the Manhattan Museum. He claims that he was in a train wreck. Police Lieutenant Cochrane (Wallace Ford), however, finds that there has been no recent wreck. Steele, unsure himself what happened, relates the bizarre events leading up to the present. A flashback ensues:\n\nMuseum director Barton (Erskine Sanford) reprimands staff member Steele over the sensational style of his public lectures and is annoyed that he wants to demonstrate a forgery detection method by X-raying a masterpiece that was recently exhibited, Dürer's \"Adoration of the Kings\". Afterward, while having a drink with girlfriend and magazine writer Terry Cordell (Trevor), Steele receives an urgent telephone call informing him that his mother has been taken to a hospital. He rushes to Grand Central Station and catches the last train. About forty minutes later, Steele watches helplessly as another train crashes head on with his.\n\nCochrane reveals that Steele's mother was never taken to the hospital. Anxious to avoid a scandal, Barton pleads with Cochrane not to arrest the man. Stevenson, the curator and Steele's friend, and Dr. Lowell (Ray Collins), a member of the museum's board of directors, vouch for Steele's character. In private, Traybin (Marshall), an art expert with Scotland Yard investigating the suspicious loss of a Gainsborough painting, tells Cochrane he wants Steele freed, with detectives discreetly following him, as he is uncertain if Steele is involved. Steele is released but is fired by Barton at the direction of the museum board because of his alleged mental instability.\n\nSteele sets out to reenact the train ride, hoping to find out what is going on. He learns that a drunk was taken off at the next station by two men and believes the supposed drunk was actually himself. He informs Stevenson of his discovery. Steele begins to suspect that the Gainsborough supposedly lost in a fire at sea was actually a fake. Later, Stevenson calls Steele to tell him he has discovered that the fire was not an accident and to meet him in the museum vault that night. When Steele arrives, however, he finds Stevenson dead. Seen standing over the body by an employee, he flees. Although both Traybin and Terry plead with him to turn himself in, Steele is determined to exonerate himself.\n\nHe coerces Barton to meet him and confirms that the Gainsborough \"lost\" was indeed a forgery and was destroyed to conceal the existence and theft of the original. Steele follows Barton to a party given by a museum board member, where he learns by eavesdropping from the fire escape that the shipment of the Dürer painting to London has been unexpectedly advanced. Steele sneaks aboard the ship where he finds a fire burning in the bonded cargo hold. He removes the painting from its frame to save it, only to discover he has been locked in. The ship's crew arrive to put out the fire, followed by Traybin and Cochcrane, who spots Steele. Steele escapes with the painting from the ship by shinnying down the hawser mooring the ship to the dock, where Terry picks him up in her car.\nTerry persuades Mary, Barton's secretary, to arrange for Steele to X-ray the painting, which he confirms is a copy. However, as he, Terry and Mary are leaving, he is knocked out and Mary pulls a gun on Terry. Terry and the punchy Steele are taken to the estate of Dr. Lowell, who is behind the thefts and forgeries. He explains to Terry that, as a frustrated art lover, he could never have acquired such fabulous works legitimately. Before killing them as the only witnesses to his scheme, Lowell uses narcosynthesis on Steele to assure himself that Steele did not tell the police, the technique he also used to make Steele believe he was in a train wreck. Lowell waits for a passing scheduled train to mask the sound of gunshots, but Traybin and Cochrane intervene, shooting Lowell just before he can kill Steele. Traybin had been waiting outside the entire time, waiting to determine where the stolen art is concealed. To save herself from being charged as an accessory to Stevenson's murder, Mary shows them the location.\n\n\nBosley Crowther, film critic for \"The New York Times,\" panned the film, especially the screenplay and direction of the drama. He wrote, \"Since Pat O'Brien's noggin suffers a blow which blacks out his memory as the story starts, there probably wouldn't be much sense taking the authors to task for the fantastic events which ensue ... This explosive and promising action sets in motion a chain of circumstances which, no doubt, must have baffled the script writers, too, for they never do give it a logical explanation ... All of the aforementioned principals turn in competent performances, and the mystery is how they managed to get through the picture without becoming hopelessly confused. They certainly were one up on us there. Played at breakneck pace, \"Crack-Up\" might have succeeded in covering up its confusion through sheer physical action, but Irving Reis elected to direct in waltz tempo. This gives one time to think about the curious motivation, and when you start thinking about a picture such as \"Crack-Up\" you are overwhelmed by its inadequacies.\"\n\n\"Time Out\" Film Guide called the film a \"[m]arginally intriguing [film] for its view of art (pro-populist, anti-\"élitist\" stuff like surrealism), it's made as a thriller by the excellent supporting cast and fine, \"noir\"-ish camerawork from Robert de Grasse.\n\nCritic Dennis Schwartz wrote of the film, \"The film takes a populist stand by promoting 'art for the masses' and takes a negative view of the art elitists (art critics and collectors) who favor such art styles as surrealism. That kind of art is considered subversive by George and is not as tame as is the classical style of Gainsborough. The art lesson didn't register, but as a thriller \"Crack-Up\" was right on track. The shadowy photography by Robert de Grasse was done in stylish chiaroscuro shadings, giving the film an uncanny feel. O'Brien was convincing as the pig-headed unconscious American who has modern technology work for him and against him, as the inventions from the war are now shared by both criminals and scientists.\"\n\n"}

In mathematics, association schemes belong to both algebra and combinatorics. Indeed, in algebraic combinatorics, association schemes provide a unified approach to many topics, for example combinatorial designs and coding theory. In algebra, association schemes generalize groups, and the theory of association schemes generalizes the character theory of linear representations of groups.\n\nAn n-class association scheme consists of a set \"X\" together with a partition \"S\" of \"X\" × \"X\" into n + 1 binary relations, R, R, ..., R which satisfy:\n\n\nAn association scheme is \"commutative\" if formula_13 for all formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10. Most authors assume this property.\n\nA \"symmetric\" association scheme is one in which each relation formula_17 is a symmetric relation. That is:\n\n\nEvery symmetric association scheme is commutative.\n\nNote, however, that while the notion of an association scheme generalizes the notion of a group, the notion of a commutative association scheme only generalizes the notion of a commutative group.\n\nTwo points \"x\" and \"y\" are called \"i\" th associates if formula_18. The definition states that if \"x\" and \"y\" are \"i\" th associates so are \"y\" and \"x\". Every pair of points are \"i\" th associates for exactly one formula_8. Each point is its own zeroth associate while distinct points are never zeroth associates. If \"x\" and \"y\" are \"k\" th associates then the number of points formula_20 which are both \"i\" th associates of formula_11 and \"j\" th associates of formula_12 is a constant formula_7.\n\nA symmetric association scheme can be visualized as a complete graph with labeled edges. The graph has formula_24 vertices, one for each point of formula_25, and the edge joining vertices formula_11 and formula_12 is labeled formula_8 if formula_11 and formula_12 are formula_8 th associates. Each edge has a unique label, and the number of triangles with a fixed base labeled formula_10 having the other edges labeled formula_8 and formula_9 is a constant formula_7, depending on formula_36 but not on the choice of the base. In particular, each vertex is incident with exactly formula_37 edges labeled formula_8; formula_39 is the valency of the relation formula_40. There are also loops labeled formula_41 at each vertex formula_11, corresponding to formula_43.\n\nThe relations are described by their adjacency matrices. formula_44 is the adjacency matrix of formula_40 for formula_46 and is a \"v\" × \"v\" matrix with rows and columns labeled by the points of formula_25.\n\nThe definition of a symmetric association scheme is equivalent to saying that the formula_44 are \"v\" × \"v\" (0,1)-matrices which satisfy\n\nThe (\"x\", \"y\")-th entry of the left side of (IV) is the number of paths of length two between \"x\" and \"y\" with labels i and j in the graph. Note that the rows and columns of formula_44 contain formula_39 formula_56's:\n\nformula_57\n\n\nThe term \"association scheme\" is due to but the concept is already inherent in . These authors were studying what statisticians have called \"partially balanced incomplete block designs\" (PBIBDs). The subject became an object of algebraic interest with the publication of and the introduction of the Bose–Mesner algebra. The most important contribution to the theory was the thesis of P. Delsarte who recognized and fully used the connections with coding theory and design theory. Generalizations have been studied by D. G. Higman (coherent configurations) and B. Weisfeiler (distance regular graphs).\n\n\nThe adjacency matrices formula_68 of the graphs formula_69 generate a commutative and associative algebra formula_70 (over the real or complex numbers) both for the matrix product and the pointwise product. This associative, commutative algebra is called the Bose–Mesner algebra of the association scheme.\n\nSince the matrices in formula_70 are symmetric and commute with each other, they can be diagonalized simultaneously. Therefore, formula_70 is semi-simple and has a unique basis of primitive idempotents formula_73.\n\nThere is another algebra of formula_74 matrices which is isomorphic to formula_70, and is often easier to work with.\n\n\nThe Hamming scheme and the Johnson scheme are of major significance in classical coding theory.\n\nIn coding theory, association scheme theory is mainly concerned with the distance of a code. The linear programming method produces upper bounds for the size of a code with given minimum distance, and lower bounds for the size of a design with a given strength. The most specific results are obtained in the case where the underlying association scheme satisfies certain polynomial properties; this leads one into the realm of orthogonal polynomials. In particular, some universal bounds are derived for codes and designs in polynomial-type association schemes.\n\nIn classical coding theory, dealing with codes in a Hamming scheme, the MacWilliams transform involves a family of orthogonal polynomials known as the Krawtchouk polynomials. These polynomials give the eigenvalues of the distance relation matrices of the Hamming scheme.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2238154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238154", "title": "Michael Fried", "text": "Michael Fried\n\nMichael Martin Fried (born April 12, 1939 in New York City) is a modernist art critic and art historian. He studied at Princeton University and Harvard University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford. He is the J.R. Herbert Boone Professor Emeritus of Humanities and Art History at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.\n\nFried's contribution to art historical discourse involved the debate over the origins and development of modernism. Along with Fried, this debate's interlocutors include other theorists and critics such as Clement Greenberg, T. J. Clark, and Rosalind Krauss. Since the early 1960s, he has also been close to philosopher Stanley Cavell.\n\nFried describes his early career in the introduction to \"Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews\" (1998), an anthology of his art criticism in the 60s and 70s. Although he majored in English at Princeton it was there that he became interested in writing art criticism. While at Princeton he met the artist Frank Stella and through him Walter Darby Bannard. In 1958, he wrote a letter to Clement Greenberg expressing his admiration for his writing and first met him in the Spring of that year. In September 1958, he moved to Oxford, Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, and then to London in 1961–62, where he studied philosophy part-time at University College, London (UCL), under Stuart Hampshire and Richard Wollheim. In 1961 Hilton Kramer offered him the post of London correspondent for the journal \"Arts\". In the fall of 1961, Fried began his friendship with the sculptor Anthony Caro; Caro had invited him to write the introduction to his Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition in 1963.\n\nIn the late summer of 1962, Fried returned to the U.S, where he combined studying for a Ph.D in art history at Harvard with writing art criticism, initially for \"Art International,\" and curating the exhibition \"Three American painters: Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella\" at Harvard's Fogg Art Museum.\n\nIn his essay, \"Art and Objecthood,\" published in 1967, Fried argued that Minimalism's focus on the viewer's experience, rather than the relational properties of the work of art exemplified by modernism, made the work of art indistinguishable from one's general experience of the world. Minimalism (or \"literalism\" as Fried called it) offered an experience of \"theatricality\" or \"presence\" rather than \"presentness\" (a condition that required continual renewal). The essay inadvertently opened the door to establishing a theoretical basis for Minimalism as a movement based in a conflicting mode of phenomenological experience than the one offered by Fried.\n\nDiscussing its upcoming publication in a 1967 letter to Philip Leider, editor of \"Artforum\" (which published the essay), Fried wrote: “I keep toying with the idea, crazy as it sounds, of having a section in this sculpture-theater essay on how corrupt sensibility is par excellence faggot sensibility, and how even if the faggots didn’t kill Kennedy (and I love this guy Garrison for insinuating they did) they ought to be kicked out of the arts and forced to go to work on Wall Street or something.”\n\nIn \"Art and Objecthood\" Fried criticized the \"theatricality\" of Minimalist art. He introduced the opposing term \"absorption\" in his 1980 book, \"Absorption and Theatricality: Painting and Beholder in the Age of Diderot\". Drawing on Diderot's criticism, Fried argues that whenever a self-consciousness of viewing exists, absorption is compromised, and theatricality results. As well as applying the distinction to 18th-century painting, Fried employs related categories in his art criticism of post-1945 American painting and sculpture. Fried rejects the effort by some critics to conflate his art-critical and art-historical writing.\n\nFried revisits some of these concerns in a study of recent photography with \"Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before\" (London and New Haven 2008). In a reading of works by prominent art photographers of the last 20 years (Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jeff Wall, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Demand among others) Fried asserts that concerns of anti-theatricality and absorption are central to the turn by recent photographers towards large-scale works \"for the wall.\".\n\nIn more recent years, Fried has written several long and complex histories of modern art, most famously on Édouard Manet, Gustave Courbet, Adolph Menzel, and painting in the late 18th century.\n\n\nFried is also a poet, having written \"The Next Bend in the Road\", \"Powers\", \"To the Center of the Earth\", and \"Promesse du Bonheur\".\n\n"}

It is a traditional dish in Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Mongolia, and Turkey.\n\nThe name \"khash\" originates from the Armenian verb (), which means \"to boil\". The dish, initially called \"khashoy\", is mentioned by a number of medieval Armenian authors, including Grigor Magistros (11th century), Mkhitar Heratsi (12th century), and Yesayi Nchetsi (13th century).\n\nThe Persian term literally means \"trotter\". The combination of a sheep's head and trotters is called , which literally means \"head [and] trotter\" in Persian.\n\nKhash is a purist meal with great parsimony in ingredients. The feet are depilated, cleaned, kept in cold water in order to get rid of bad smell, and boiled in water all night long, until the water has become a thick broth and the meat has separated from the bones. No salt or spices are added during the boiling process. The dish is served hot. One may add salt, garlic, lemon juice, or vinegar according to one's taste. Dried lavash is often crumbled into the broth to add substance. Khash is generally served with a variety of other foods, such as hot green and yellow peppers, pickles, radishes, cheese, and fresh greens such as cress. The meal is almost always accompanied by vodka (preferably mulberry vodka) and mineral water.\n\nIn Georgia, Khashi is served together with onions, milk, salt and chacha. Usually they eat this dish early morning, or during hangovers.\n\nIn the medieval Armenian medical textbook \"Relief of Fevers\" (1184), khash was described as a dish with healing properties, e.g., against snuffle. It was recommended to eat it while drinking wine. In case of ailment, khash from the legs of a yeanling (lamb or kid) was advised.\n\nFormerly a nutritious winter food, it is now considered a delicacy, and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal. Modern-day convention in Armenia dictates that it should be consumed during the month that has an \"r\" in its name, thus excluding May, June, July, and August (\"month names in Armenian are derivatives of the Latin names\"). Khash is traditionally consumed during cold months in Azerbaijan and Georgia.\n\nIn the South Caucasus, khash is often seen as a food to be consumed in the mornings after a party, as it is known to battle hangovers (especially by men) and eaten with a \"hair of the dog\" vodka chaser.\n\nThere is much ritual involved in khash parties. Many participants abstain from eating the previous evening, and insist upon using only their hands to consume the unusual (and often unwieldy) meal. Because of the potency and strong smell of the meal, and because it is eaten early in the mornings and so often enjoyed in conjunction with alcohol, khash is usually served on the weekend or on holidays.\n\nKalle-pache (; ; literally meaning \"head [and] trotter\") consists of a sheep's head (including the brain) and trotters, and is typically seasoned with lemon and cinnamon. Usually consumed as a breakfast soup, kalle-pache is traditional to Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nIn Iran, kalle-pache is usually cooked in specialty stores, and is served in the morning. It is especially consumed during cold seasons. To prepare kalle-pache, the sheep's head and trotters are collected, cooked, and treated as per the recipe.\n\nDuring winter it is very common to eat sheep or cow parts soup with onions and spices, especially the legs which is called 'Maraq regel' it is usually accompanied with an alcoholic drink.\n\nPacha is a traditional Iraqi dish made from sheep's head, trotters, and stomach; all boiled slowly and served with bread sunken in the broth. The cheeks and tongues are considered the best parts. Many people prefer not to eat the eyeballs which could be removed before cooking. The stomach lining would be filled with rice and lamb and stitched with a sewing thread (). Sheep brain is also included.\n\nThe dish is known in Kuwait, Bahrain, and other Persian Gulf countries as \"Pacheh\" (), since the Arabic alphabet has no letters 'p' and 'ch' so the dish is written with 'b' and 'j' as in \"Bajeh\" ) . A variation of that is found in other Arab countries such as in Egypt and is known as \"kawari\"' (), Egyptians eat cow brain and sheep brain.\n\nAlbania's popular pache () consists of a sheep's or any cattle's head, that is boiled until meat comes off easily. It is then stewed with garlic, onion, black pepper, and vinegar. Sometimes a little flour is added to thicken the stew. It is also frequently cooked with cattle feet or tripe. It makes a hot and hearty winter stew.\n\nIn Turkish culinary culture, \"pacha\" ( is a generic word for certain soup preparations, especially with offal, but also without it. In most parts of Turkey, such as in Kastamonu, for instance, the term (\"feet pacha\") is used for cow, sheep, or goat hooves, and the term is used for \"head pacha\" (chorba). Sometimes the term is also used for tongue soup, while \"meat pacha\" is made with (scrag end of sheep's neck). In Turkey, the word refers to a sheep's head roasted in the oven, which is served after grilling at specialized offal restaurants.\n\nThe Greek version, called \"patsás\" (πατσάς), may be seasoned with red wine vinegar and garlic (\"skordostoubi\"), or thickened with avgolémono. The Greek version sometimes uses calf feet with the tripe.\n\nSpecialized tavernas serving patsa are known as \"patsatzidika\". Because patsas has the reputation of remedying hang-over and aiding digestion, \"patsatzidika\" are often working overnight, serving people returning home after dinner or clubbing.\n\n\n"}

Some of these criteria may be subsets of other criteria (for example, having a meld of one dragon versus having a meld of all of them), and in these cases, only the criteria with the tighter requirements are scored. The points obtained may be translated into scores for each player using some (typically exponential) function. When gambling with mahjong, these scores are typically directly translated into sums of money. Some criteria may also be in terms of both points and score.\n\nThe terminology of \"point\" differs from variation to variation. A common English term is \"double\", as the point-to-score translation is typically exponential with a base of 2. Cantonese variants will use the term 番 (pinyin: \"fān\" / jyutping: faan).\n\nBecause \"points\" and \"score\" are two distinct concepts, this article will adopt the use of the term \"score unit\" to refer to a point in a player's score.\n\nAt the beginning of each game, each player is given a fixed score, usually in the form of scoring chips. In many cases, only the winner scores, with the winner's gain being deducted from the three losers' scores (that is, the losers pay the winner). In many cases, there exist other modifiers to the score. A common set of modifiers (for which this article will call the \"standard payment variations\") include:\n\n\nThere is no general rule for when a player runs out of score units. In some circles, the match is immediately aborted, with the player furthest ahead in score declared the winner, while in others, a player out of scoring chips continues to play without risk of further losses.\n\nMahjong is sometimes played in a gambling setting. Poker chips are used for keeping score only. Since Mahjong is a zero-sum game, when one player loses all his chips, his chips are distributed among the other winners. In this case, the loser pays cash to buy back the chips from the winners and the game continues. Before the game starts, all players must agree upon how much one set of chips (100 unit) is worth. Some gamblers do away with chips and pay cash after each round depending on local laws regarding legality of gambling.\n\nThe criteria mentioned below are by no means exhaustive or common to every variation, but are common to many 13-tile and 16-tile variations.\n\nThe following is a list of the different terms describing the progress of one's hand:\n\n\nThese hands are not standard hands, but can be used to win nonetheless. Because they diverge from the criteria for a normal winning hand, it is inherently risky to attempt these hands: effectively all pieces need to be self-drawn since melds are not useful to these hands\n\n\nThe largest group of criteria concern the contents of the winning hand. Typically, a hand that is more improbable will score higher than one that is more common, but this may not be the case. In variations with scoring minimums, it is generally accepted that, barring improbable high-scoring hands (such as the \"Heavenly Hand\" described below, even if the winning hand is otherwise scoreless), at least one point must be from this set of criteria. It is not uncommon for players to define minimum fan requirements for declaring a winning hand (typically 1 or 2), and at times a maximum fan cap or ceiling (for example at 7 or 8 fan). Also note that generally speaking in Hong Kong mahjong, 13 fan is considered the absolute limit for fan.\n\n\nThe point translation function is, as stated above, typically an exponential function. The function itself is subject to variation, typically to set an upper bound:\n\n\nThe faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the money (or \"points\") the losers pay the winner. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules.\n\nThis table is based on play where 3 faan is the minimum needed in order to win with a legal hand. If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth 4 base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. Individual players must double the amount of base-points owed for the following:\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player...then the player must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\nHong Kong Mahjong is essentially a payment system of doubling and redoubling where winning from the wall adds great value to the final payment and where the dealer is highly rewarded or penalized if he or she wins or loses.\n\nThe faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the money (or \"points\") the losers pay the winner.

It was a branch of the federal Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nThe Liberal-Conservatives formed government in October 1897, when Lieutenant Governor Charles H. Mackintosh returned to Northwest Territories to enforce the new laws in the Northwest Territories Act that gave new powers to the territories. It was speculated that Robert Brett was plotting to form a Conservative led Government backed by a majority coalition of MLA's in the Legislative Assembly of Northwest Territories. Members answered in the media and denied there was a plot. Mackintosh would stick with his original plan of asking Frederick Haultain who was already Chairman of the Executive Committee to form the government, leaving Robert Brett to form the Official opposition of the Northwest Territories Liberal Party and oppose the Haultain administration as he had done so since 1891.\n\nThe influence and popularity of Premier Haultain helped him build his coalition of lawmakers in the Legislative Assembly. The party was formed as a consequence of executive powers being released to elected members from the Lieutenant Governor that had been held since 1870. The beginning of party politics in the territories sparked controversy and was not done through any Grass roots movement or formed on traditional ideological lines, and was done by Haultain in such a way that there was very little visibility to the public until years later after the party system began to mature.\n\nHaultain's first appointment to his executive council was a Liberal by the name of James Hamilton Ross. Haultain led a large cabinet into the 4th Northwest Territories general election in 1898. Only Haultain and Ross held portfolios while the rest of the ministers did not. The government became widely known as the Haultain-Ross government.\n\nThe party swept the 1898 general election with a large majority.\n\nIt went on to win the 1902 election with a reduced majority. The party itself had little visibility as Haultain abhorred Dominion party lines and did not wish to promote it. He believed in the consensus model of government, and wanted it for all provinces and territories.\n\nAfter the election of 1898, Haultain appointed two Liberals and one Conservative to his cabinet. Liberal-Conservative party members accused Haultain's government of being a \"Grit hive\". To appease party supporters, he subsequently appointed two Conservatives and one Liberal.\n\nA large convention was held on 26 March 1903 in Moose Jaw. The convention attracted delegates from all parts of the populated Northwest Territories, some travelled 700+ miles to make the journey. The convention attracted a large number of federal Conservative Members of Parliament and Conservative Senators.\n\nThe convention laid out a formal structure to the party for the first time, as well as setting creating a policy book and putting together an executive council to operate outside of the legislature. The main focus of the party was to put together a coherent policy which the party previously lacked and is thought to have led to the decline in seats for the Liberal-Conservative government.\n\nAmong the policy resolutions put forward and adopted was provincial rights, better conditions for settlers, and electoral reform in the creation of an enumerated voters list. The delegates voted to run the party banner in the next territorial election, and that includes contested nominations.\nOne delegate stated in an interview to the Calgary Herald, if the Liberals don't want to address the provincial autonomy Robert Borden was also congratulated on becoming leader of the federal Conservative party to run for Prime Minister of Canada.\nThe Liberal party was also heavily attacked during the convention, with two different motions condemning them for corrupt electoral practice, and following the federal Liberal Party of Canada policy on the question of provincial powers, and labor laws for the Territories.\n\nPremier Haultain was shocked by the Convention and openly opposed the move towards defining the political lines in the legislature. The organizers of the convention planned the election of officers without Haultain's knowledge.\n\nThe great Moose Jaw convention stands to this day as the largest political gathering in Northwest Territories history.\n\nFrom 1903 to 1905 there were three short sittings in the Legislative Assembly. The bulk of the Legislation moved by the Liberal-Conservative government was minor and had to do with incorporating organizations and communities and concurring municipal by-laws.\n\nThe remainder of the time was spent lobbying the federal government for more resources to deal with the huge influx of settlers to the territories. Haultain personally clashed with Wilfrid Laurier to settle the provincial rights question.\n\nThe last session of the legislature ended in October 1904 and would not be held again in the territories until 1921. Premier Haultain spent the early part of 1905 meeting with the federal government to work out an arrangement to settle provincial autonomy.\n\nAfter the arrangement of creating Alberta and Saskatchewan were passed in the federal parliament. The party in its last months held nominations and began working on plans to prepare for the new elections in Saskatchewan and Alberta. On August 31, 1905 the 5th North-West Legislative Assembly was dissolved along with the Association and party politics in the Territories came to an end.\n\nIn September 1905 provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created out of the more heavily populated, southern regions of the Northwest Territories. Party members then joined the Alberta Conservative Party, and the Provincial Rights Party in Saskatchewan. Many members, including some Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) defected to the Alberta Liberal Party and Saskatchewan Liberal Party, draining the Conservative parties of manpower and experienced politicians.\n\nThere was a lot of anger among remaining Conservatives at Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberals for passing over Haultain and appointing Liberal members to form government in both provinces. Laurier also appointed Liberal Party supporters to draw up the new electoral boundaries, which consequently were said to favour Liberal candidates.\n\nNo formal executive party structure aside from the Executive Council of the Haultain Government is known to exist prior to 1897, officers of the party were first elected in 1903.\n\n\n\n"}

Of Irish descent, he often played Irish and Irish-American characters and was referred to as \"Hollywood's Irishman in Residence\" in the press. One of the best-known screen actors of the 1930s and 1940s, he played priests, cops, military figures, pilots, and reporters. He is especially well-remembered for his roles in \"Knute Rockne, All American\" (1940), \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938), and \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959). He was frequently paired onscreen with Hollywood legend James Cagney. O'Brien also appeared on stage and television.\n\nO'Brien was born in 1899 to an Irish-American Catholic family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All four of his grandparents had come from Ireland. The O'Briens were originally from County Cork. His grandfather, Patrick O'Brien, for whom he was named, was an architect who was killed while trying to break up a saloon fight in New York City. His mother's parents, the McGoverns, immigrated from County Galway in the west of Ireland in the mid- to late-19th century.\n\nAs a child, O'Brien served as an altar boy at Gesu Church, while growing up near 13th and Clybourn streets in Milwaukee. He attended Marquette Academy with fellow actor Spencer Tracy, who became a lifelong friend. During World War I, O'Brien and Tracy joined the United States Navy. They both attended boot camp at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, but they never went to sea, as the war ended before their training had finished.\n\nJack Benny was also at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center at the same time as O'Brien and Tracy. According to his autobiography, Benny performed a number on the violin at a show one evening, when the sailors started booing and heckling him. O'Brien walked on stage and whispered in his ear, \"For heaven's sake, Ben, put down the damn fiddle and talk to 'em.\" Benny stopped playing his violin and made a series of comments that got laughs from the audience. In this way, O'Brien indirectly helped to start Benny's career in comedy.\n\nAfter the war, O'Brien finished his secondary schooling at Marquette Academy and later attended Marquette University. While still at college, he decided to seek work as an actor. He and Spencer Tracy moved to New York, where they both attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. The two struggling young actors shared a small apartment, and began their careers on the stage.\n\nO'Brien spent a decade in plays on Broadway and in the New York City area.\n\nO'Brien made his film debut in the Vitaphone Varieties short film, \"The Nightingale\", produced in New York and released in August 1930. His first starring role was as ace reporter Hildy Johnson in the original 1931 version of \"The Front Page\" with Adolphe Menjou. In 2010, this film was selected by the National Film Preservation Board for preservation in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nHe was the lead in Paramount's \"Personal Maid\" (1931), and appeared in a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical \"Flying High\" (1931), supporting Bert Lahr. He was Irene Dunne's love interest in RKO's \"Consolation Marriage\" (1932), then co-starred opposite a young Bette Davis in \"Hell's House\" (1932). O'Brien stayed in leads, going from studio to studio: \"Scandal for Sale\" (1932), at Universal; \"The Strange Case of Clara Deane\" (1932), at Paramount; \"Hollywood Speaks\" (1932), \"American Madness\" (1932) and \"Virtue\" (1932).\n\nO'Brien played a heroic pilot in Universal's \"Air Mail\" (1932), directed by John Ford. While at that studio he was in \"Laughter in Hell\" (1932) and \"Destination Unknown\" (1933). At the small Majestic Pictures he starred in \"The World Gone Mad\" (1933).\n\nO'Brien's first Warner Bros. movie was \"Bureau of Missing Persons\" (1933), starring Bette Davis. He went to RKO for \"Flaming Gold\" (1933) and MGM for \"Bombshell\" (1933), then Warners signed O'Brien to a long-term contract. He would remain with the studio until 1940, when he left after a dispute over the terms of his contract renewal.\n\nO'Brien supported Dick Powell in \"College Coach\" (1933) and Joan Blondell in \"I've Got Your Number\" (1934).

He headlined a musical \"Stars Over Broadway\" (1935) then was back with Cagney for Howard Hawks' \"Ceiling Zero\" (1935). Cagney later sued Warners for billing O'Brien's name above his.\n\n\"Jimmy's grand to work with,\" said O'Brien in 1935. \"You couldn't ask for a better partner but there's a limit to all that.

But as it is I've been with him in every uniform - the army, the navy, the police, the marines, the air corps - and it's always a case of me falling for his girl or him falling for mine. It gets tiresome... I don't just want to be a fast-talking Charlie all my life.\"\n\nWarners gave him some starring parts: \"I Married a Doctor\" (1936), \"Public Enemy's Wife\" (1936), \"China Clipper\" (1936), \"The Great O'Malley\" (1937), and \"Slim\" (1937) with Henry Fonda. He was a prison guard in \"San Quentin\" (1937) opposite Humphrey Bogart, romanced Blondell in \"Back in Circulation\" (1937) and was an old sailor in \"Submarine D-1\" (1938).\n\nO'Brien was pulled out of \"Swing Your Lady\" to support Kay Francis in \"Women Are Like That\" (1938) and was back with Powell for \"Cowboy from Brooklyn\" (1938). He and Cagney reteamed for \"Boy Meets Girl\" (1938), and he was meant to be back with Powell in \"Garden of the Moon\" (1938), but Powell refused to do it - he was replaced by John Payne.\n\nO'Brien has one of his best ever roles as the former street kid turned priest in \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938) with Cagney. He was with Blondell in \"Off the Record\" (1939) and \"The Kid from Kokomo\" (1939), and supported Ann Sheridan in \"Indianapolis Speedway\" (1939).\n\nHe went over to Paramount for \"The Night of Nights\" (1939), part of a deal in which Warners bought the rights to \"The Old Maid\" from Paramount. He then made \"Slightly Honorable\" (1939) for United Artists.\n\nBack at Warner Bros he was reunited with Cagney for \"The Fighting 69th\" (1940) then made \"Castle on the Hudson\" (1940) with Sheridan and John Garfield. He was a cop in \"'Til We Meet Again\" (1940), supported Cagney and Sheridan in \"Torrid Zone\" (1940). He supported Garfield and Frances Farmer in \"Flowing Gold\" (1940).\n\nO'Brien was then given his best known role, as the famous University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in \"Knute Rockne, All American\" (1940). In the film, he gave the speech to \"win just one for the Gipper,\" referring to recently deceased football player, George Gipp, portrayed in the film by a young Ronald Reagan. Reagan later used this saying as a slogan for his campaign for president in 1980.\n\nO'Brien was at a career peak. He was considered for the role of Alvin York in the film \"Sergeant York\". From this high point, however, O'Brien left Warner Bros in July 1940.\n\nAfter he left Warner Bros. in 1940, O'Brien signed a contract with 20th Century Fox for two films a year. However they ended up not using him.\n\nHe signed with Columbia Pictures to make two films a year. He was in \"Escape to Glory\" (1940), then was idle for a year before making \"Two Yanks in Trinidad\" (1942) with Brian Donlevy and \"Flight Lieutenant\" (1942) with Glenn Ford. At Universal he was in \"Broadway\" (1942) with George Raft.\n\nSoon he signed a contract with RKO and appeared in several movies for that studio. He mostly played authority/military roles such as \"The Navy Comes Through\" (1942), and \"Bombardier\" (1943). \"The Iron Major\" (1943) was an attempt to repeat the success of \"Knute Rockne\" with O'Brien as \"Frank Cavanaugh\".\n\nAt Universal he supported Deanna Durbin in \"His Butler's Sister\" (1943) then it was back to RKO for \"Marine Raiders\" (1944).\n\nWith his agent Phil Ryan O'Brien set up his own production company, Teneen Productions. They signed a deal with Columbia to make a film with O'Brien, \"Secret Command\" (1944). (In 1955 the IRS would sue him for earnings on this film.) At RKO he did \"Having Wonderful Crime\" (1946) and \"Man Alive\" (1945). For Columbia he made \"Perilous Holiday\" (1946).\n\nIn 1946 he starred in the successful \"film-noir\" suspense film, \"Crack-Up\". He was in a thriller, \"Riffraff\" (1947) and another biopic \"Fighting Father Dunne\" (1948). He followed it with \"The Boy with Green Hair\" (1948), and \"A Dangerous Profession\" (1949) with Raft.\n\nWhile working as a Hollywood contract player, O'Brien made occasional appearances on the radio in the 1930s and 1940s. In the summer of 1947, he starred with Lynn Bari in \"Summer Theater\", a program \"dramatizing episodes in the life of a small town druggist.\"\n\nO'Brien's movie career slowed considerably by the early 1950s, although he still managed to get work in television. In his autobiography, \"The Wind At My Back\", he professed to being completely flummoxed about the decline of his career. His close friend, Spencer Tracy, fought with his studio, MGM, to get roles for O'Brien in his films, \"The People Against O'Hara\" (1951) and \"The Last Hurrah\" (1958).\n\nHe still had leads in films like \"Okinawa\" (1952), \"Inside Detroit\" (1956) and \"Kill Me Tomorrow\" (1957). In 1959 O'Brien appeared in one of his best-known movies as a police detective opposite George Raft in \"Some Like It Hot\", starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis.\n\nIn his later years, O'Brien often worked in television. He was cast in 1956 and 1957 in four episodes of the religion anthology series, \"Crossroads\". In three of the four programs, he played priests. He also performed in two episodes of \"The Virginian\" in the mid-1960s. In the 1960-1961 television season, O'Brien joined Roger Perry in the 34-episode ABC sitcom, \"Harrigan and Son\", about a father-and-son team of lawyers. He played the lead role of James Harrigan, Sr.\n\nO'Brien made numerous appearances on television as himself, including several on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". In 1957, he guest starred in the first season of the NBC variety program, \"The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford\". Other shows in which he appeared as himself include the interview programs: \"The David Frost Show\", \"The Tonight Show\", \"The Merv Griffin Show\", and \"The Joey Bishop Show\". In 1957, Ralph Edwards profiled O'Brien's life and career for an episode of \"This Is Your Life\". He was also the mystery guest on the game show \"What's My Line?\" in 1953 and 1957. In the \"Jennifer and the Will\" episode of \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", he has a memorably comic turn as Jennifer Marlowe's elderly boyfriend. Shortly thereafter, O'Brien's final filmed performance came in a 1982 episode of \"Happy Days\".\n\nO'Brien spoke the Star Spangled Banner to the accompaniment of Doc Severinsen on trumpet for the National Anthem opening of Super Bowl IV in 1970. He was invited to do his because of his role as Knute Rockne.\n\nHe had a small role as Burt Reynolds' father in the 1978 comedy film \"The End\", opposite Myrna Loy, cast as Reynolds' mother.\n\nIn later years, O'Brien recalled that he had had three \"great\" movie roles in his career: Knute Rockne, Hildy Johnson in \"The Front Page\", and Father Duffy in \"The Fighting 69th\".\n\nFrom the 1960s through the early 1980s, O'Brien often traveled around the United States as a one-man act and in road shows. He also performed frequently in nightclubs.\n\nNear the end of his life, he toured in a stage production of \"On Golden Pond\", which he considered \"absolutely the best play\" he had ever read.\n\nIn the late 1930s, O'Brien and a small group of his actor friends began to meet to converse and exchange opinions and stories. Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky dubbed them the \"Irish Mafia,\" but they preferred to call their social group the \"Boys Club.\" In addition to O'Brien, the original members of the club were James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Allen Jenkins and Frank McHugh, all of whom were Irish-Americans. Later Lynne Overman joined their group and then George Brent, Louis Calhern, William Gargan, Paul Kelly, Regis Toomey, Ralph Bellamy, Lloyd Nolan and Frank Morgan. James Gleason and Bert Lahr were also frequent guests. The actors gathered to socialize, but they also occasionally used the group to discuss ideas about their latest movies. By the mid-1940s the group began to break up, as members either moved or died. Some of the surviving members kept in contact by telephone and occasional meetings.\n\nO'Brien and his wife, Eloise, had four children: Mavourneen, Sean, Terry, and Brigid. Three of his children were adopted. The youngest, Brigid O'Brien (born 1946), was his biological child. Eloise O'Brien occasionally appeared on stage with her husband.\n\nAmong those who knew him personally, O'Brien was known for his love of storytelling, jokes, and late-night parties. Bob Hope specifically remembered him as a raconteur. Another friend recalled that he was always \"the life, and I mean the lively life, of the party.\" He traveled to Vietnam as part of a US tour in February 1969.\n\nO'Brien died on October 15, 1983 from a heart attack at age 83, following minor prostate surgery. President Ronald Reagan, released a White House statement noting his sadness over his old friend's death. The president had called the actor at the hospital just days before his death.\n\nShort Subjects:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2238233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238233", "title": "Gang scheduling", "text": "Gang scheduling\n\nIn computer science, gang scheduling is a scheduling algorithm for parallel systems that schedules related threads or processes to run simultaneously on different processors. Usually these will be threads all belonging to the same process, but they may also be from different processes, where the processes could have a producer-consumer relationship or come from the same MPI program.\n\nGang scheduling is used to ensure that if two or more threads or processes communicate with each other, they will all be ready to communicate at the same time. If they were not gang-scheduled, then one could wait to send or receive a message to another while it is sleeping, and vice versa. When processors are over-subscribed and gang scheduling is not used within a group of processes or threads which communicate with each other, each communication event could suffer the overhead of a context switch.\n\nGang scheduling is based on a data structure called the Ousterhout matrix. In this matrix each row represents a time slice, and each column a processor. The threads or processes of each job are packed into a single row of the matrix. During execution, coordinated context switching is performed across all nodes to switch from the processes in one row to those in the next row.\n\nGang scheduling is stricter than coscheduling. It requires all threads of the same process to run concurrently, while coscheduling allows for \"fragments\", which are sets of threads that do not run concurrently with the rest of the gang.\n\nGang scheduling was implemented and used in production mode on several parallel machines, most notably the Connection Machine CM-5.\n\nIn gang scheduling, one to one mapping happens, which means each task will be mapped to a processor. Usually, jobs are considered as independent gangs, but with a bag of gangs scheme, all the gangs can be combined and sent together to the system. When jobs are executed in the system, the execution can never be completed until and unless all the gangs that belong to the same BoG complete their executions. Thus, if one gang belonging to some job completes its execution, it will have to wait until all the gangs complete their executions. This leads to increased synchronization delay overhead.\n\nResponse time formula_1 of formula_2 Bag of Gangs is defined as the time interval from the arrival of the BoG at the grid dispatcher to the completion of jobs of all of the sub-gangs which belong to the BoG. The average response time is defined as follows:\n\nResponse Time (RT)=formula_3.\n\nThe response time is further affected when a priority job arrives. Whenever a priority job arrives at the system, that job will be given priority with respect to all other jobs, even over the ones which are currently being executed on the processors. In this case, when a priority job arrives, the sub-gang which is currently executing on the system will be stopped and all the progress that has been made will be lost and need to be redone. This interruption of the job will further delay the total response time of the BoG.\n\nAdapted first come first served (AFCFS) scheme is the adapted version of first come and first serve scheme. As per the first-come, first-served scheme, whichever job that comes first will be forwarded for execution. But in the AFCFS scheme, once a job arrives at the system, the job will not be scheduled unless and until enough processors are available for the execution of the respective job. When a large job arrives at the system and is present at the start of the ready queue but not enough processors are available, then an AFCFS policy will schedule the smaller job for which enough processors are available, even if that job is at the back of the queue. In other words, this scheme favors smaller jobs as compared to larger jobs based on the availability of processor, thus this will leads to increased fragmentation in the system.\n\nIn the above execution scheme, the tasks which correspond to increasing job size are placed in a queue, with the tasks belonging to the largest gang scheduled first, but this method of execution tends to lead to the starvation of resources of smaller jobs and is therefore unfit to be executed in systems where the number of processors is comparatively low.\n\nThe AFCFS and LGFS also have to deal with possible processor failure. In such a case, tasks executing on that processor are submitted to other processors for execution. The tasks wait in the head of the queue on these processors while the current processor is being repaired.\n\nThere are two scenarios which emerge from the above issue:\n\nGang scheduling while executing the I/O bound processes keeps the CPUs idle while awaiting responses from the other processors, whereas the idle processors can be utilized for executing tasks. If the gang consists of a mix of CPU and I/O Processes, since these processes interfere little in each other’s operation, algorithms can be defined to keep both the CPU and the I/O busy at the same time and exploiting parallelism. This method would present the idea of matching pairs of gangs, one I/O based and one CPU bound. Each gang would assume that it is working in isolation as they utilize different devices.\n\n\nConcurrent gang scheduling a highly scalable and versatile algorithm and assumes the existence of a synchronizer utilizing the internal clock of each node. CGS primarily consists of the following three components.\nThe synchronization algorithm is performed in two stages.\nWe assume the existence of a synchronizer that sends the signal to all the nodes in a cluster at a constant interval. The CGS utilizes the fact that the most common events which occur in a PC are timer interrupts and they use the same parameter to be the internal clock.\n\nThe SHARE scheduling system utilizes the internal clock system of each node and is synchronized using the NTP Protocol. The flavor of scheduling is implemented by collecting jobs with same resource requirements in a group and executing the same for a pre-defined time-slice. Incomplete jobs are pre-empted after the time slice is exhausted.\n\nThe local memory of the node is utilized as the swap space for pre-empted jobs. The main advantages of the SHARE scheduled system are that it guarantees the service time for accepted jobs and supports both batch and interactive jobs.\n\nSynchronization:\n\nEach gang of processes utilizing the same resources are mapped to a different processor. The SHARE system primarily consists of three collaborating modules.\n\nA new slot is created when we cannot pack the job into the available slot. In case, a new slot is opened even if the job can be packed in the available slot, then the run fraction which is equal to one over the number of slots used will increase. Therefore, certain algorithms have been devised on packing criteria and are mentioned below:\n\nThis algorithm monitors the slots capacity and decides whether there is any need of opening a new slot. There are two variants on this algorithm:\n\n1. \"First fit.\" Here, the used slots are checked for capacity in a sequential order then the first one which is having sufficient capacity is chosen. If none of the available slots have enough capacity, a new slot is opened and the processing elements (PE) are allocated in the slot in sequential order.\n\n2. \"Best fit.\" Unlike first fit, the used slots are sorted based on capacity, but not in sequential order. The slot with the smallest sufficient capacity is chosen. If none of the used slots have sufficient capacity, then only one new slot is opened. Once the new slot is opened, the processing elements (PEs) are allocated in the slot in sequential order as per the previous algorithm.\n\nThis algorithm is a modified version of the best fit algorithm. In the best fit algorithm, the PEs are allocated in a sequential order, but in this algorithm, the PEs can be inserted from both directions so as to reduce the overlap between different sets of PEs assigned to different jobs.\n\n1. \"Left-right by size.\" Here, the PEs can be inserted in sequential order and in reverse sequential order based on the size of the job. If the size of the job is small, the PEs are inserted from left to right and if the job is large, the PEs are inserted from right to left.\n\n2. \"Left-right by slots.\" Unlike the previous algorithm, where the choice was based on the size of the job, here the choice is dependent on the slot. Now, slots are indicated as being filled, i.e. being filled from the left or from the right. The PEs are allocated to the job in the same order. The number of slots on both sides is approximately equal, so when a new slot is opened, the direction is indicated based on the number of slots in both direction.\n\nBoth the capacity-based and left-right based algorithms do not accommodate the load on individual PEs. Load-based algorithms take into account the load on the individual PE while tracking the overlap between sets of PEs assigned to different jobs.\n\n1. \"Minimal maximum load.\" In this scheme, PEs are sorted based on the load on them that each job will have on the PEs. The availability of the free PEs in the slot determines the capacity of the slot. Suppose that PEs are allocated to a job which has formula_4 threads, the formula_5PE in the load order (last one) will determine the maximum load that any PE can have which is available in the slot. The slot which has minimal maximum load on any PE is chosen and a number of least loaded free PEs are used in the slot.\n\n2. \"Minimal average load.\" Unlike the previous scheme, in which slots were chosen based on the minimal maximum load on formula_5 PE, here slots are chosen based on the average of the load on the formula_4 least loaded PEs.\n\nIn this algorithm the PEs are assigned in clusters, not individually. The PEs are first partitioned into groups that are power of two. Each member of the group will be assigned a controller and when a job of size n arrives, it is assigned to a controller of size 2 (the smallest power to 2 that is larger than or equal to n). The controller is assigned by first sorting all the used slots, and then identifying groups of 2 contiguous free processors. If a controller has all the PEs free in some of the slots, then only a newly arrived job will be assigned to that controller. Otherwise a new slot is opened.\n\nIn all the above-mentioned algorithms, the initial placement policy is fixed and jobs are allocated to the PEs based on that. However, this scheme migrates jobs from one set of PEs to another set of PEs, which in turn improves the run fraction of the system. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2238235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238235", "title": "Greater Grand Forks Greenway", "text": "Greater Grand Forks Greenway\n\nThe Greater Grand Forks Greenway is a huge greenway bordering the Red River and Red Lake River in the twin cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota (commonly called Greater Grand Forks). At 2,200 acres (9 km), the Greenway is more than twice the size of New York City's Central Park. It has an extensive, system of bike paths, which are used by bikers, walkers, joggers, and rollerbladers. In 2007, the system was designated as a National Recreation Trail by the National Park Service. \n\nSeveral city parks and golf courses are also located within the Greenway on each side of the river. Other amenities include wildlife observation areas, a state campground, fishing areas, interpretive displays, wildflower gardens, and fields for various athletics including softball, basketball, and disc golf.\n\nThe Greenway was developed after the devastating Red River Flood of 1997. The land encompasses large areas of the floodplain along the rivers, which are subject to seasonal flooding, often severe. These areas had previously been developed for residential and business uses, much of which were damaged or destroyed in the 1997 flood, with major property losses. To protect the communities, a massive new dike system was built. It required removal of several residential areas on both sides of the river, most of which had been inundated and severely damaged. \n\nThe Greenway includes the area of floodplain between these new dikes and the rivers. Today, the Greenway serves the dual purpose of providing recreational opportunities throughout the year for metropolitan area residents, and being part of the regional flood prevention program. Its trees and greenery can absorb some of floodwaters naturally. The dikes provide another level of protection to hold back river waters from the built-up city areas beyond. \n\nA series of \"trail heads\" exist at various points along the Greenway. These trail heads offer breaks in the dikes or floodwalls so that pedestrians can access the Greenway. Most of these trail heads offer paved parking lots for access, and many also offer public restroom facilities. Other amenities at select trail heads include picnic areas and playgrounds.\n\n\n\nSeveral designated park spaces have been established in the Grand Forks portion of the Greenway. These parks are maintained by the Grand Forks Park District. \n\nAt the far north side of the Greenway is Riverside Park. This is one of the oldest parks in the city of Grand Forks and is a focal point for the northern portion of the Greenway. The park features a playground, restrooms, several picnic sites and an outdoor pool. North of Riverside Park is the Riverside Dam. This dam has been reconfigured since the flood of 1997 and now includes a waterfall called Riverside Rapids. The Riverside Rapids area includes boat access to the Red River and a pedestrian walking bridge that connects the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks sides of the Greenway.\n\nFormerly called Central Park, Kannowski Park is located just south of Downtown Grand Forks. It is another park established early in city history. The small park features a playground, restrooms, and picnic areas. The park was recently renamed Kannowski Park in honor of Frances Kannowski, superintendent of the Grand Forks Park District from 1933 to 1953. Kannowski was the first female superintendent of a park district in the United States.\n\nLincoln Drive Park is located further south, within the area of the former Lincoln Drive neighborhood. The residential neighborhood was inundated during the 1997 flood and had to be almost entirely demolished. Lincoln Drive Park features a warming house, which is rented out for private parties; large picnic facilities, playgrounds, a wildflower garden, historic displays about the former neighborhood, and a disc golf course. Just south of Lincoln Drive Park is a steep stretch of the dike, which is known as \"the sledding hill.\" This \"hill\" is a popular site for sledding in the winter.\n\nLincoln Golf Course is located along Belmont Road within the Greenway. The course, established in 1909, is the oldest golf course in North Dakota. Lincoln has many large, established trees. Formerly an 18-hole course, it was redeveloped as a par 35, 9-hole course, due to requirements of area needed for dike construction. A small clubhouse features a snack bar, pro shop, and restrooms. To the east of Lincoln Golf Course is the Pat Owens pedestrian bridge. Named after the mayor of Grand Forks during the 1997 flood, the bridge crosses the river to connect to the Greenway in East Grand Forks, Minnesota.\n\nThe portion of the Greenway that runs through Downtown Grand Forks is landscaped and carefully maintained (an irrigation system has recently been installed). A set of brick gateways and flags on both sides of DeMers Avenue celebrate the connection to the Greenway. \n\nThe area south of the Sorlie Bridge (DeMers Avenue) features a monument overlooking the Red River. It shows the heights of past floods, surpassed by far by that of 1997. A wide set of stairs and terraced levels of ground lead down to the monument. This area also had a labyrinth designed and installed. North of the Sorlie Bridge is another set of stairs leading down to the river. Referred to as the \"Community Green,\" this area features many trees and shrubs, a small gazebo, and parking.\n\nThe Grand Forks Town Square is located directly adjacent to the Greenway, at the corner of DeMers Avenue and Third Street. Town Square features an amphitheater. It is the site of many community events throughout the year, including the Grand Cities Art Fest each June and the Farmers' Market during the summer months.\n\nThe East Grand Forks side of the Greenway has three distinct parks: Sherlock Park near downtown East Grand Forks, Griggs Park near the \"Point\" at the confluence of the Red River and Red Lake River, and O'Leary Park on the banks of the Red Lake River in the southern part of the city. Sherlock Park includes the only city-owned pool in East Grand Forks, as well as picnic facilities and a large playground. The playground was largely destroyed by a fire in the spring of 2011. Griggs Park includes school athletic fields and a boat ramp for access to the rivers. O'Leary Park is a heavily wooded park that sometimes attracts wildlife. The park also includes athletic fields, picnic facilities, and a playground.\n\nOn the extreme north side of the Greenway in Grand Forks is the 18-hole Valley Golf Course. The construction of the flood control system required a major reconfiguration of the golf course. The complex includes a club house with banquet facilities.\n\nIn East Grand Forks, the downtown portion of the flood control system is not made of earthen dikes. A flood wall is installed piece-by-piece during floods. This allows people in downtown East Grand Forks to have a direct view of the Red River. The \"dry side\" of the flood wall is an area called The Boardwalk, a brick path lined with several restaurants and bars to take advantage of the river view. On the \"wet side\" of the flood wall (in the Greenway) is an area called Rotary Park, which includes a fountain.\n\nLocated just north of downtown East Grand Forks is a campground. Operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, it is in the Red River State Recreation Area. The campground features 48 camp sites with water, electric, and sewer hookups; and 36 camp sites without hookups. The campground is located directly west of Sherlock Park, in the former Sherlock Park residential neighborhood. Inundated during the Red River Flood of 1997, all homes and other structures in the neighborhood were severely damaged and were demolished. This area is now part of the Greenway.\n\nBoth city and state agencies own and operate areas of the Greenway. On the Grand Forks side, the city of Grand Forks owns all land within the Greenway. The Grand Forks Park District is responsible for managing and maintaining four park areas of Lincoln Golf Course, Riverside Park, Kannowski Park (formerly Central Park), and Lincoln Drive Park. On the East Grand Forks side, the city of East Grand Forks owns a section of the Greenway in the downtown area. All other land on the East Grand Forks side is owned by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This section is called the Red River State Recreation Area.\n\n"}
{"id": "2238248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238248", "title": "Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules", "text": "Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules\n\nThe Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules are similar to that of the Chinese Old style / Hong Kong system, but accounts for the different set of tiles used.\n\nThe Singaporean Mahjong tile system consists of 148 tiles due to the additional Animal tile set, thus slightly different from that of other regional Mahjong tile-sets. Therefore, the rules of the game somewhat vary from other scoring systems in the region. The stacking of tiles will be 19 stacks for the dealer (East) and the player opposite (West), 18 stacks for the rest. The Dead Wall (王牌\"wáng-pái\") is 15 tiles. The tile set is described as follows:\n\nThese tiles run from One to Nine. There are 4 of each tile in every set.\n\nThe dots suit ()\n\nThe bamboo suit ()\n\nThe character suit ()\n\nHonour Tiles (/) consists of 4 Wind tiles & 3 Dragon tiles.\n\nWind tiles ()\n\n<br>\nFrom left to right: East, South, West, North\n\nDragon tiles (三元牌, pinyin \"sān yuán pái\")\n\n<br>\nFrom left to right: Red Dragon, Green Dragon, White Dragon\n\nFlower set (花牌 \"huā pái\") and Season set (季牌 \"jì pái\")\n\n<br>\nFrom left to right: Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter\n\nAnimal Tiles (禽兽牌\"qín shòu pái\" / 动物牌\"dòng wù pái\")\n\nFrom left to right: Cat, Rat, Rooster, Centipede\n\nPoints (台) are scored from the difficulty of gathering the winning hand. If monetary rewards (and losses) are involved, it is common that playing parties will agree upon a monetary value awarded to a one-point winning hand. Subsequently, for each additional point scored, this value is accordingly doubled.\n\nThere is a typical maximum scoring limit of five points, though this has to be agreed among players. This point limit (simply known as the \"limit\"), and will be used to describe the points awarded by certain tile-combinations from now on. In other words, a certain tile combination that awards the \"limit\" means that it scores the maximum number of points, as agreed upon before the game.\n\nFor example, assume that players agree on a value of S$1 for a one-point winning hand. A two-point winning hand thus has a value of S$2, a three-point hand with a value of $4, up to a limit of $16 for a five-point winning hand.\n\nFurthermore, the party who is guilty of discarding the tile which another party then takes to complete a winning hand has to pay double the agreed payout. Another situation where the winning player receives double the agreed payout is when he draws the winning tile by himself/herself i.e. Self-Pick (自摸\"zì-mō\").\n\nThe following table summarizes the payouts, based on an assumed base payout of S$1 for a one-point winning hand.\nIn the event that the winning player draws the winning tile by himself/herself, Self-Pick (自摸\"zì-mō\"), the payout is as follows:\n\nAnother common mahjong payout among younger Singaporeans involves 'shooter pays all' whereby the person who discards the winning tile will have to compensate for the rest of the players. However for this rule, certain rules like 'Fresh Tile Mahjong Scenario (包生)' and '包满台' etc do not come in effect as the loser will have to pay for everyone when he/she discards the winning tile. Some Singaporeans have this particular rule whereby the person who 自摸 the winning tile shall be compensated an additional $2 on top of what everyone has to pay.\n\n1/2 Payout Chart\nThe payout for special hands will be double, no matter the winner zi mo (自摸) or one of the player shoots.\n\nHaving a triplet of any Dragon Tile (元yuán) scores 1 point. This triplet can be obtained by Pong (碰\"pèng\"), Kong (杠;槓\"gàng\"), or simply having these 3 tiles in your hidden hand.\n\nHaving a triplet of the seat wind or the prevailing wind scores 1 point. This triplet can be obtained by Pung (碰\"pèng\"), Kong (杠\"gàng\" ), or simply having these three tiles in your hidden hand.\n\nIf the Prevailing Wind (圈风\"quān-fēng\") happens to coincide with your Seat Wind (门风\"mén-fēng\"), and you manage to obtain a triplet of that wind, you score 2 points. For example, if the prevailing wind is East and a player whose seat wind is East, a triplet of East by the player will score 2 points upon Mahjong.\n\nIf there is a triplet of both the Seat Wind (门风\"mén-fēng\") \"and\" the Prevailing Wind (圈风\"quān-fēng\"), you score 2 points. For example, if the Prevailing Wind (圈风\"quān-fēng\") is East and a player whose Seat Wind (门风\"mén-fēng\") is South, a triplet of East and a triplet of South by the player will score 2 points (1 point for each triplet) upon Mahjong.\n\nEach animal tile obtained scores 1 point. One extra point (for a total of 5) is awarded if all 4 animals are collected.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there will be a one-time payout by all playing parties to the party who collects either\n\na) Both the cat tile and the mouse tile.\n\nb) Both the chicken tile and the centipede tile.\n\nThe above two events are known as \"yǎo-dào\" (咬到). Literally it means 'Bitten' in English.\n\nc) All the four animal tiles. This generally also earns double of the agreed one-time payout.\n\n咬到 has 2 different meanings in the game. When any player opens their tiles in the beginning of the game and sees the combination of a) and/or b) and c), he will be considered to have 暗咬, and compensation will usually be $4 for each combination of a), b) or c) (all these are cumulative). If after replenishment of tiles (补花\"bǔ-huā\") happened and any of the a), b) or c) happens, then compensation will usually be $2 for each combination of a), b) or c) (all these are cumulative).\n\n\"Note 1.1.1\": \"One-time\" refers to each instance whenever any player collects any of the above. In other words, if player A collects set (c) in the current game, he will receive the payout from all other parties immediately. In the event that player A collects the same set in the next game, he will again have to be compensated as well. This compensation will take place each time any set described above is collected.\n\n\"Note 1.1.2\": This payout is also one-time because the player who obtains the set combination(s) will not be re-compensated for these combinations at the end of the game, regardless of the result.\n\n\"Note 1.1.2.1\": However, pertaining to the above, the points scored by obtaining animal tiles will still be in effect. In other words, if player A collects set(c), he will be rewarded with an instant payout. In the event that he wins that same instance of the game as well, he will have scored 5 points by virtue of having 4 animal tiles, on top of any other points that he scores with his winning hand.\n\n\"Note 1.2\": The payout above is cumulative. This means that if a player collects set (c), he will have to be compensated for set (a), set (b) \"and\" set (c).\n\n\"Note 1.3\": A commonly agreed payout is, assuming a base payout of S$1 for a one-point winning hand, S$2 (which means collecting set (c) will earn a payout of $2+$2+$4). In other words, the payout can be pegged to that of a one-point 'Self-Pick' (自摸\"zì-mō\"). This must however be separately agreed-upon before the start of the game.\n\n\"Note 1.4\": In the special event that set (a) or set (b) is collected immediately at the start of the game (even before the 'Replacement Tile' (补花\"bǔ-huā\") event), the payout is again doubled. With reference to Note 1.3, if a player collects set (c) in this special case, he will receive a payout of $2*2 + $2*2 + $4.\n\nEach flower tile that matches a player's seat wind scores one point (正花\"zhèng-huā\"). Other flower tiles won't score any point. (偏花\"piān-huā\")\n\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there will be a one-time payout by all playing parties to the party who collects both flowers (red and blue) that match the player's Seat Wind. This is a 'Bitten' (咬到\"yǎo-dào\") event.\nThis payout is equivalent to obtaining a set of cat-and-mouse tile, or chicken-and-centipede tile. Refer to the discussion above. This will earn the payout agreed for a 'Bitten' (咬到 \"yǎo-dào\") event.\nThe double payout scheme applies when the collection of both flowers occurs before the 'Replacement Tile' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\") event. Refer to the discussion above. This will earn the payout agreed for an 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"àn-gàng\") event.\n\nNote: Not everybody plays with all these 'Bitten' (咬到 \"yǎo-dào\") events so it is best to confirm with everybody before commencing your mahjong game. Some play with 'Bitten' (咬到 \"yǎo-dào\") events only for the Animal tiles, and some do not play with any 'Bitten' (咬到 \"yǎo-dào\") events at all.\n\nA complete group of 4 flower tiles of the same colour scores a total of 2 points, 1 for the flower tile that matches the player's seat wind, and 1 for collecting all four.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there will be a one-time payout by all playing parties to the party who collects the complete set of flowers of the same colour. This is a 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"àn-gàng\") event.\n\nThis payout is equivalent to obtaining a set of cat-mouse-chicken-centipede tile. In other words, this will earn the payout agreed for a 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠\"àn-gàng\") event. Refer to the discussion above.\n\nAny player who collects 2 complete groups of 4 flower tiles (8 in total) either by 'Self-Pick' (自摸\"zì-mō\") or by 'robbing', has achieved a '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù) that scores the limit. Because of its rarity, there is a lack of agreement as to the number of points actually scored by this hand. However, in practice, this combination simply scores the maximum number of points.\n\nAny player who collects 2 complete groups of 4 flower tiles (8 in total) all by himself i.e. 'Self-Pick' (自摸 \"zì-mō\") is called 'All Flowers & Seasons' or 'Eight Immortals' (八仙过海\"bā-xiān-guò-hǎi\"), a type of '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù). The combination of hidden cards held by the player does not matter at all, and the game is considered to have been won and game is ended as a win for the player.\n\nHowever, some players are notably particular regarding the above point. If any player collects the complete '8 Flower Tile-set', he wins the game, but he should never reveal his hidden cards to anyone. This follows from the fact that the player has not won the game by virtue of his hidden cards, which should be the case. If the player with the complete set of flowers display his hidden hand to the rest, and it is not a hand that fulfills any winning combination, he is considered to have cheated, or 'Fake Hand' (诈胡 \"zhà-hú\") and must instead compensate the rest of the parties. The point to note is that the player who collects the complete '8 Flower Tile-set' should immediately close his hidden cards and declare himself to have won the game.\n\nThe player who completes the flower set has triggered 3 events, on top of winning the game. He has gathered \n\nAll 3 events above are liable for one-time compensation by the rest of the playing parties, if the event themselves are not compensated already. This is on top of the payout given to the winning party by winning the game.\n\nIf a player has already drawn 7 flower tiles, and \"any\" of the other three players draws the last flower tile, the player with the 7 tiles is considered to have won the game by \"robbing\" the last flower tile as a discard of the player that draws the last flower tile. This is called 'Robbing the Eighth' (七抢一 \"qī-qiǎng-yī\").\n\nThe player who drew the last flower tile, strictly speaking, did not discard the tile. However, due to the immense probabilistic difficulty of achieving a complete '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù), such a situation described above is considered a sufficient condition for a '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù) event.\n\n\"Note 1\": The player who drew the last flower tile, and thus causing the player with 7 flower tiles to win the game, will thus be the 'guilty' party, and is subjected to the same payout scheme described in Table 1.1.\n\n\"Note 2\": It is extremely important that, in the event that a player amasses 7 flower tiles, this player \"must\" declare that he/she demands an inspection of everyone's hidden hand at the end of the game and describe the 'Pao' (包 \"bāo\") condition in this scenario which is described below. In the event if the eighth flower did not appear in the course of the game, and the game ends:\n\n(i) in a stalemate (荒牌 \"huāng pái\") with 15 un-drawn tiles remaining, the player who amasses the 7 flower tiles \"must\" just before the last tile (which is the 16th tile from the back) is drawn, declare that he will conduct an inspection of everyone's hidden hand.\n\n(ii) with some other player won the game, the player who amasses the 7 flower tiles \"must\" immediately declare that he/she will conduct an inspection of everyone's hidden hand, so to prevent anyone from dismantling their tiles away.\n\nAfter this declaration, the rest of the playing parties should reveal their hidden hand to the declaring player. If he/she discovers that one of the parties has been keeping the eighth flower within his hidden hand, he/she is considered to have won the game with a '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù), even if the game has already ended.\n\nThe 'guilty' party can either be made to pay for everyone's losses (known as 'Pao' (包\"bāo\")), or pay as if the game was won mid-way, as it should be. This will depend on the agreement between all playing parties. Any party who does not heed the declaration of card inspection and proceeds to dismantle the tiles upon the ending of the game (so that it will be impossible for the declaring player to inspect his cards) will also be deemed to be guilty of holding on the eight flower tile in secret, and the declaring player is considered to have won the game with a '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù).\n\n\"Note 3\": As described above, the winning party should not disclose his hidden hand, in the event of a '8 Flower Tile-set' (花胡huā-hù), if it does not fulfill the criteria of any winning combinations. If he does, some players may consider this to be cheating, or 'Fake Hand' (诈胡 \"zhà-hú\"), and the winning-turned-losing party must compensate the rest of the playing parties.\n\nA 'Triplets Hand' (对对胡 duì-duì-hú or 碰碰胡 pèng-pèng-hù) scores 2 points.\n\nThe above is an example of a hand that satisfies a 碰碰胡 \"pèng-pèng-hù\" combination that scores two points, that is, any 4 triplets and any pair of tiles (eyes) to fulfill this combination. It does not matter if your hand of tiles is a mixture of Exposed Pong (碰 \"pèng\") tiles and triplets held within your hidden hand.\n\nHowever a special condition arises when this combination is held entirely within the winning party's hidden hand. That is, the winning party fulfills this combination with a Self-Pick (自摸 \"zì-mō\"), and has no exposed 'Pong' (碰\" pèng\") tiles or 'Exposed Kong' (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\"). In other words, the winning party drew and obtained every tile in this combination himself. This hand is refer to as 'Hidden Treasure' (四暗刻 sì-àn-kè or 坎坎胡 kǎn-kǎn-hù) is extremely rare and it is generally awarded the limit.\n\n\"Note 1\": To achieve the winning combination of \"Hidden Treasure\", the winning party can only perform 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"àn-gàng\") if he has 4-of-a-kind of a particular tile. He cannot perform an 'Exposed Kong' (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\") on any discarded tile from the rest of the players. If he does, the winning hand can only be considered as a 'Triplets Hand'.\n\n\"Note 2\": To achieve a winning combination of \"Hidden Treasure\", the winning party \"must\" complete the game with a 'Self-Pick' (自摸 \"zì-mō\"). It is immaterial whether he/she has already 4 hidden triplets, and is awaiting one single tile to complete the eye, or otherwise.\n\n\"Note 3\": In some playing circles, it is sufficient to have 4 hidden triplets and go mahjong with a single tile, and still be able to qualify for this hand as all the 4 triplets are still in the hand.\n\nA 'Half Flush Hand' (混一色 \"hún-yī-sè\" or 半色\"bàn-sè\") scores 2 points.\n\nThe above are examples of combinations which fulfill the 'Half Flush' criteria. This combination simply requires\n\n1) a pure set of tiles from \"one single suit\" either from the 'Character' (万子), 'Dots' (筒子) or 'Bamboo' (索子) tile sets, plus\n\n2) any set of tiles from the 'Winds Tiles' (四风牌 \"sì fēng pái\") or 'Dragon Tiles' (三元牌 \"sān yuán pái\") suit.\n\nIf the set of tiles are entirely from \"one single suit only\" , then this combination is known as Full Flush Hand (清一色 \"qīng-yī-sè\"). This combination is awarded 4 points.\n\nAgain, special conditions can arise from this.\n\n(i) Full Flush Sequence Hand (清一色平胡) \n\nIf the set of tiles are entirely from \"one single suit\", and it also fulfill the Sequence Hand, then this special combination is known as Full Flush Sequence Hand (清一色平胡). Due to its extreme difficulty, in addition to the probabilistic difficulty of not drawing any animal or flower tiles, it is generally awarded 10 points, or the limit.\n\nFull Flush Lesser Sequence Hand (清一色小平胡), in which the winning party has drawn flowers or animals, wins a total of 5 points, 1 for the Lesser Sequence Hand (小平胡) combination and 4 for Full Flush Hand (清一色) combination.\n\nAnother special condition can arise from having a hand of all triplets and a pair of eyes, either from the \"wàn-zǐ\" (万子), \"tòng-zǐ\" (筒子) or \"suò-zǐ\" (索子) tile sets. This Full Flush Triplets Hand (清一色碰碰胡) will score 8 points (2 for the hand itself, 2 for a Triplets Hand (碰碰胡) combination, and 4 for a Full Flush Hand (清一色) combination), or the limit.\n\n(iii) Another special condition can arise from amassing the 13 tiles as shown below, either from the Character (万子\"wàn-zǐ\"), the Dots (筒子\"tòng-zǐ\") or the Bamboo (索子 \"suò-zǐ\") tile sets.\n\nNotice that these 13 tiles do not constitute a winning hand. However, any player, by virtue of having these 13 tiles, can simply win the game with \"any\" discarded tile from that same suit. The player can chow to obtain the sequences, or pong to obtain the ones and nines triplets. As long as a player amasses these 13 tiles, and wins the game with \"any\" tile of the same suit, he will have completed this rare 'Nine Gates Hand' (九连宝灯\"jǐu-lián-bǎo-dēng\"), which awards the limit.\n\nA \"Mixed Terminals Hand\" (混么九\"hún-yāo-jǐu\"/混老头\"hún-lǎo-tou\"), or commonly known as \"dà-pái-yī-jǐu\" (大牌一九) scores 4 points (2 for triplets and 2 for mixed terminals).\nThis is a mixture of\n\n1. ones or nines (thus, \"terminals\") from either of the \"wàn-zǐ\" (万子), \"tòng-zǐ\" (筒子) \"or\" \"suò-zǐ\" (索子)\n\nor\n\n2. either of the Winds tiles (风 \"fēng\") \"or\" Dragon tiles (元 \"yuán\").\n\nIt \"must\" also fulfill the Triplets Hand (碰碰胡 \"pèng-pèng-hù\") criteria. However, special situations, as described below, can arise from this.\n\nThe 'Pure Terminals Hand' (清么九\"qīng-yāo-jǐu\"/清老头\"qīng- lǎo-tou\") is made up \"entirely\" of ones \"or\" nines from either of the \"wàn-zǐ\" (风子), \"tòng-zǐ\" (筒子) \"or\" \"suò zi\" (索子) tilesets. This condition is also known as 一九\"yī-jǐu\". Due to its extreme rarity, this is awarded the limit.\nThe All Honours Hand (字一色 \"zì-yī-sè\") is made up \"entirely\" of tiles from either the Winds tiles (风 \"fēng\") \"or\" Dragon tiles (元 \"yuán\") tiles. This condition is also known as 大字 \"dà-zì\". Due to its extreme rarity, this is awarded the limit.\n\nA Sequence Hand (平胡 \"píng-hù\") scores 4 points. In addition, the winning player has to be waiting for at least 2 different tiles in order to win.\n\nA 'Sequence Hand' is one where a player obtains a winning hand of 4 sets of sequences (順子 \"shùn zǐ\") and 1 pair of tiles, all from either the Character (万子 \"wàn-zǐ\"), Dots (筒子 \"tòng-zǐ\") or Bamboo (索子 \"sùo-zǐ\") tile sets. (However, special allowance is given to the nature of the pair of tiles. These pair of tiles can be from the Character tiles, Dots tiles or the Bamboo tiles, or any Winds (风 \"fēng\") which is \"neither\" the Prevailing Wind (圈风 \"quān-fēng\") \"nor\" the Seat Wind (门风 \"mén-fēng\") of the winning player.\n\nThe act of forming a melded sequence is called 'Chow' (吃 \"chī\").\n\nA 'Sequence Hand' is considered difficult to amass because winning with this hand requires that (i) the player does not draw any animal or flower tiles. \n(ii) The player cannot win on a discarded tile by another player, if that discarded tile is an in-between tile (嵌张 \"qiàn zhāng\"), edge tile (边张 \"biān zhāng\"), or only one tile required to complete the pair (单钓 \"dān diào\"), i.e. All Single Wait (一飞 \"yī fēi\" / 单听 \"dān tīng\") is not acceptable for this hand.\nNote: 2-Sided Wait or more is acceptable for this hand in Singapore. For example, 6, 7, 8 & 9 of the Dots tiles, waiting for 6 & 9 of the Dots tiles to win by forming a pair.\n\nExample: A player has the seven of the Dots tiles and the nine of the Dots tiles, he requires the eight of the Dots tiles to complete the winning hand. He cannot declare his combination of tiles to be a 'Sequence Hand' if another player discards the eight of the Dots tiles. That is, the four point awarded to the Sequence Hand does not count. He can, however, still win the game by virtue of other points he has already scored, by drawing animals for example. But, if he manages to draws the eight of the Dots tiles by himself (自摸 \"zì-mō\"), his winning combination is considered to be a 'Sequence Hand'.\n\nThe point here to note is that, a player waiting for either an in-between tile, edge tile (an eight and a nine, waiting for a seven) or a single tile to complete the required pair can only claim a 'Sequence Hand' if he Self-Pick (自摸 \"zì-mō\") that particular tile. If he is waiting for any two tiles (a two and a three, waiting for either a one or a four) to complete the winning hand, he can claim these tiles from any party who discards it.\n\nA special situation exists where a player cannot claim a 'Sequence Hand' even if he Self-Pick (自摸 \"zì-mō\") the last required tile. This situation happens when a player melded all 4 sequences required by discards from other player, and is left with a single tile. In this event it is clear that he is awaiting that single tile to complete his hand, therefore it cannot be considered a 'Sequence Hand'.\n\nIf a player manages to amass a combination of cards that adheres to the requirements set above, but has drawn flowers \"and/or\" animal tiles, then he can only claim a 'Lesser Sequence Hand' (小平胡 \"xiǎo-píng-hù\" / 臭平胡 \"chòu-píng-hù\"), which awards only 1 point, on top of any points awarded to him by the flower \"and/or\" animal tiles.\n\nA special event known as 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower' (花上 \"huā-shàng\") scores one point.\n\nThis event happens when a party, who is waiting for a tile to complete his winning hand (also known as the 'Ready Hand' (听牌 \"tīng-pái\")), draws a flower \"and/or\" animal. This will require him to replace the drawn flower \"and/or\" animal by drawing a 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\") from the end of the wall. In the event that the tile drawn to replace the flower \"and/or\" animal is the tile needed to complete his winning hand, he is considered to score a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower' (花上 \"huā-shàng\"). This event itself is worth one point, as mentioned above, in addition to any points scored by the combination of his winning hand.\n\nThere exists a special event in which a player draws two flower \"and/or\" animal tiles in a row, and upon the second consecutive 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花\"bǔ-huā\"), he draws the tile which he requires to complete his winning hand. This event is known as 'Flower on Flower' (花上花 \"huā-shàng-huā\"). Some players may choose to consider this as a special event which awards 5 points, but not others. There are also some players who consider each consecutive 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\" ), leading up to a final 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower' (花上 \"huā-shàng\"), to contribute one additional point each. For example, Player A draws 3 consecutive flower \"and/or\" animal tiles before finally obtaining the tile required for a winning hand on the third 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\"), he will have gotten 3 additional points for 3 consecutive 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\") followed by a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower' (花上 \"huā-shàng\"). The point scored for the above special events will have to be agreed upon before the game.\n\nIn any of the above \"huā-shàng\" (花上) event, it is immaterial whether the drawn flower matches the seat number of the player's.\n\nAnother special event known as 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong' (杠上 \"gàng-shàng\") scores one point.\n\nThis event happens when a party, who is waiting for a tile to complete his winning hand (also known as the 'Ready Hand' (听牌 \"tīng-pái\")), either\n\n1) draws a tile which complete a 4-of-a-kind in his hidden hand, in which he can perform an 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"àn-gàng\"), or\n\n2) has a 3-of-a-kind in his hidden hand, and any other player discards the last tile of that kind, in which he can perform a 'Exposed Kong' (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\"), or\n\n3) has a Pong (碰 \"pèng\") triplet exposed, and draws the last tile of that kind himself, in which he can perform a 'Exposed Kong' (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\")\n\nAny of the above 3 events will require him to replace the Kong (杠 \"gàng\") by performing a by drawing a 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\"). In the event that the tile drawn to replace the 'Kong' (杠 \"gàng\") is the tile needed to complete his winning hand, he is considered to score a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong' (杠上 \"gàng-shàng\"). This will event itself is worth one point, as mentioned above, in addition to any points scored by the combination of his winning hand.\n\n\"Instant payment\" \n\"Note 1\": It is common that an instant payout is given to the party who performs a 'Exposed Kong' (明杠\"mìng-gàng\"), and the payout follows that of a \"yǎo-dào\" (咬到) event. For the performance of an 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"àn-gàng\"), it will generally earn double that of the 'Exposed Kong' (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\"), just like the event of drawing a cat-mouse-chicken-worm set of tiles.\n\n\"Note 1.1\": However, in the event of a 'Robbing the Kong' (抢杠 \"qiǎng-gàng\"), the player who performs the 'Kong' (杠 \"gàng\") \"need not\" be compensated, and instead will be the 'guilty' party who is considered to have discarded that tile for the player performing a 'Robbing the Kong' (抢杠 \"qiǎng-gàng\"). This event is described in the next section.\n\nA special event can also be triggered from a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong' (杠上 \"gàng-shàng\"). The sequence of events is as follows\n\n1) Player A has a concealed triplet in his hand, and any other player discard the last of that tile, or\n\n2) Player A has a concealed triplet in his hand, and he draws the last of that tile himself, or\n\n3) Player A has an exposed triplet, and he draws the last of that tile himself\n\nIn all 3 scenarios above, he is able to perform a 'Kong' (杠 \"gàng\") and must perform a 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\"). In the event that he draws a tile from this 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\"), in which he is already holding on to either\n\n4) a concealed triplet of that tile in his hand, or\n\n5) an exposed triplet of that tile,\n\nhe is then naturally able to perform another Kong (杠 \"gàng\") and then another 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\"). \"If and only if\" Player A draws a replacement tile (from this particular second-in-a-row 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\")) which he is able to complete a winning hand, he is considered to have performed a 'Kong on Kong' (杠杠胡 \"gàng-gàng-hú\"). Due to the immense probabilistic difficulty of such a feat, it is generally awarded 10 points, or the \"limit\", whichever is the smaller number.\n\nRobbing the Kong (抢杠 \"qiǎng-gàng\") scores one point.\n\nThis event occurs when\n\n1) a playing party has a 'Pong' (碰 \"pèng\") triplet exposed,\n\n2) and draws the last tile of that kind himself, and in which he\n\n3) perform an Exposed Kong (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\"), and\n\n4) another player, who is waiting for that very last tile of that kind to complete his own winning hand,\n\n5) 'robs' the 'Kong' (杠 \"gàng\") to complete his winning hand.\n\nThis exact sequence of events must occur for a 'Robbing the Kong' (抢杠 \"qiǎng-gàng\") event to be triggered. Note that 抢杠 can be for any combination in the hand i.e. it does not have to only be 平胡 or 臭平胡) to win.\n\nHowever if there are already 3 same tiles that has been 碰\"pèng\" by player A and player B is waiting for that particular last tile to form his 平胡 hand and this happened to be an in between tile or corner tile (一万&二万 waiting for 三万 or 七筒&九筒 and waiting for 八筒) , 抢杠 will only give the winning player 1 point upon mahjong as the 平胡 rule is not in effect. However if player B is waiting for 2 tiles to form 平胡, a 抢杠 will give him 5 points (4 for 平胡 and 1 for 抢杠).\n\nNote that the other variant of 'Exposed Kong' (明杠 \"mìng-gàng\") in which a player calls a \"Kong' from a discarded tile with a triplet in his hidden hand, does not count as 'Robbing the Kong' (抢杠 \"qiǎng-gàng\"). The player who requires that last tile can still declare a win (胡 \"hù\"), but will not have deemed to have performed a 'Robbing the Kong' (抢杠 \"qiǎng-gàng\") event.\n\nThere is a special condition where 'Robbing the Kong' can be used to rob an 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"an-gang\"). The condition is that a particular player is waiting for his last tile to complete the \"Thirteen Wonders\" (十三么). This is the only condition where 'Robbing the Kong' can be used to rob an 'Concealed Kong'.\n\n'Winning on the Last Available Tile\" scores 1 point. This event is also known as \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月), literally \"scooping the moon from the ocean bottom\". The last available tile is the last 16th un-drawn tile from un-drawn stack.\n\n\"Note 1\": There is a special condition in which \"Winning on the Last Available Tile' \"does not\" trigger the \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月) event. This condition is fulfilled when the last 16th tile is drawn as a result of a 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\") or 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\") event.\n\nExample 1. Player A draws the last 17th tile, which turns out to be a flower. He turn proceeds to perform a 'Replacement Tile For Flower' (补花 \"bǔ-huā\") by drawing the last 16th tile. In the event that he wins with that last tile, it will \"not\" be considered \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月).\n\nExample 2. Player A draws the last 17th tile, which he does not want, and discards it. Player D performs a \"gàng\" (杠), and 'Replacement Tile For Kong' (补杠 \"bǔ-gàng\" ) by drawing the last 16th tile. If Player D wins on the last tile, it will \"not\" be considered \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月).\n\nExample 3. Player A draws the last 18th tile, which turns out to be a flower. He draws a replacement tile, the last 17th tile, and it turns out to be an animal. Finally, he draws the last 16th tile and completes his winning hand. This will \"not\" be considered \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月).\n\nHowever a special event may have been triggered, depending on the agreement of playing parties. Refer to the above discussions on 'Winning on Replacement Tile' (花上,杠上).\n\n\"Note 2\": In some playing circles, the game is considered a draw if the last 16th tile is a Bonus Tile. No one-time payout will be required, unless the player has gotten 8 flower tiles for the special hand.\n\n\"Note 3:\" In some playing circles, 海底捞月 will only be considered if that tile is 一筒.\n\nA 'Pure Green Suit Hand' (绿一色 \"lǜ-yī-sè\") scores four points instead of just two points for Mixed One Suit, due to the increased difficulty. The hand only consist 2,3,4,6 or 8 of the bamboo suit (索子) plus the Green Dragon as a pair or triplet. (Note: As for why it is called Pure Green Suit is that in the early days, all the above tile carvings are painted green.)\n\nThe 'Three Lesser Scholars' (小三元 \"xiǎo-sān-yuán\") scores three points (one for the eye pair, and two for the pong/kong of the other two Dragon tiles).\n\nExample 1: \n\nExample 2: \n\nExample 3: \n\nA 'Four Lesser Blessings' (小四喜 \"xiǎo-sì-xǐ\") score three or four points (two for the hand itself, plus the bonus points for a pong/kong of the prevailing wind and/or player wind).\n\nExample 1: \n\nA 'Three Great Scholars\" (大三元 \"dà-sān-yuán\") scores 10 points, or the \"limit\", whichever is the smaller number.\n\n\"Note 1\" : A common rule in Singapore dictates that any player who collects all 3 triplets of the 3 元 tiles, either by having them in your hidden hand, or by performing Pong (碰 \"pèng\") to obtain exposed triplets, can declare himself to have fulfilled the 大三元 combination. The combination of the hidden hands, under this rule, does not matter. Invoking this rule when a player collects all 3 triplets earns that player 5 points, instead of 10.\n\n\"Note 1.1\" : Care must be taken by any player, who invokes the above rule, to conceal their hidden hand while declaring the game to be won. Otherwise, if the hidden hand is revealed, certain players consider this to be cheating, because the said party has not won the game by virtue of his entire hand of tiles, as it should be. If such a situation arise, the winning-turned-losing party must compensate the rest of the playing parties.\n\nA 'Four Great Blessings' (大四喜 \"dà-sì-xǐ\") score the \"limit\" (Generally, there appears to be a lack of agreement as to the number of points actually scored by these hands. However, in practice, this combination simply scores the maximum number of points).\n\n\"Note 1\" : For 'Four Great Blessings', a common rule in Singapore dictates that any player who collects all 4 triplets of the 4 individual Wind (风 \"fēng\") tiles, either by having them in your hidden hand, or by performing 'Pong' (碰 \"pèng\" ) to obtain exposed triplets, can declare himself to have fulfilled the 大四喜 combination. The combination of the hidden hand (more specifically, the last required pair of any tile) under this rule, does not matter. Invoking this rule when a player collects all 4 triplets earns that player 10 points, instead of the \"limit\".\n\n\"Note 1.1\" : Care must be taken by any player, who invokes the above rule, to conceal their hidden hand while declaring the game to be won. Otherwise, if the hidden hand is revealed, certain players consider this to be cheating, because the said party has not won the game by virtue of his entire hand of tiles, as it should be. If such a situation arise, the winning-turned-losing party must compensate the rest of the playing parties.\n\n\n + any tile in the same set\n\nThis winning hand is considered to be one of the hardest to accomplish and therefore has priority to win from a tile from any player's discard, superseding players in front of you who could have gamed from that tile. Thirteen Wonders is the only hand that can snatch a 'Concealed Kong' (暗杠 \"àn-gàng\"). Furthermore, it can supersede a self-made winning tile even if the practitioner is waiting for the same card as the self-made winning tile (this only applies to pure Thirteen Wonders). Due to the immense difficulty in assembling this hand, all players pay double that of the limit, regardless if the hand was won on a self-picked (自摸) tile or not.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where the player manages to 'Kong' (杠 \"gàng\") four times. It results in the player having 18 tiles excluding flower and animal tiles, hence its name. It also scores maximum points due to its rarity.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where the first player, as the dealer, wins the round on the first turn (i.e. with the tiles given after dealing and flower/animal/kong any and all etc... replacement needed without draw card). Because of its extreme rarity, this criterion is often awarded the limit.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where a non-dealer wins from the dealer's first discard. Scenario 2 whereby a non-dealer wins upon drawing the first card in the game. Because of its rarity, this criterion is often awarded the limit.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where a non-dealer wins by discard within the first go around of the game before his/her first draw & no exposed meld (except Concealed Kong) formed by anyone. Because of its rarity, this criterion is often awarded the limit.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where you do not eat or pong and draw all the tiles yourself, you must also self draw your winning tile. This adds one point to your hand.\nNote: Not everybody plays with this rule so it is best to confirm with everybody before commencing your mahjong game.\n\nThis refer to the scenario where the Hand does not conform to any scoring pattern, no value Bonus tile and no value 'Pong' (碰 pèng) etc. This Hand used to be played in Singapore but with the introduction of Minimum Point Requirement (起胡 \"qǐ-hú\") of one point in Singapore, this Hand has become invalid in most playing circles.\n\nEver since the introduction of Minimum Point Requirement (起胡 \"qǐ-hú\") of one point in Singapore, the only low value hand is 'Lesser Sequence Hand' (小平胡), but due to many restrictions, it is not an easy hand as well. Perhaps the reason why some players in Singapore started to introduce other low value hand in their playing circle. For example, the Fully Concealed Hand (门清) above.\n\nHigh-risk discards are also an element of Singapore-style scoring, with the player making such a discard paying for the other two losing players, in addition to their own (the other two losing players are vindicated - they do not pay anyone anything). High-risk scenarios only occur when a player is visibly near victory, with that player winning because of a high-risk discard.\n\nThe following is a typical list of high-risk scenarios:\n\nPlayer A has two Dragon Pongs or Kongs exposed. Player B discards a third Dragon and the Player A is able to Pong/Kong it or complete an eye with it (and thereby winning), forming a third set of Dragons. If Player A wins the game with Player B's discard or his own tile, Player B pays all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds:\nHigh-risk discard would be:\nSame as Dragon Tile Set Scenario, but requires three exposed Wind sets and completing a fourth with a discard.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds:\nHigh-risk discard would be:\nNote: Dragon tiles are also considered high-risk discard:\ndue to the possibility of a 'All Honours Hand' (字一色).\n\nPlayer A has one less than the maximum number of points (typically 4) exposed. Player B discards a Dragon tile, a Prevailing Wind (圈风 \"quān-fēng\") or a Player's Seat Wind (门风 \"mén-fēng\") that is taken by A, thereby making a total of the maximum number of points (typically 5). If Player A wins the game with Player B's discard or his own tile, Player B pays all winnings. Another unique scenario is where Player A has two less than the maximum number of points (typically 3) exposed. Player B discards the Wind tile that is both the Prevailing Wind and the Player's Seat Wind, that is taken by A, thereby making a total of the maximum number of points (typically 5). If Player A wins the game with Player B's discard or his own tile, Player B pays all winnings. However for the scenario of shooter pay, Player B will only need to pay for all the winnings if Player A 自摸. If Player B discarded Player A's tiles, he would only need to pay for 5 points (as per usual).\n\nExample:\n\nThe limit is 5 points. Player A already has 4 points on his exposed tiles. His seat wind is South and the prevailing Wind is East.\n\nPlayer A's exposed tiles:\nHigh-risk discards:\nPlayer A has 3 or 4 sets of the same suit (bamboo, dots, character or honour) exposed. If Player B discards a tile of the same suit and Player A uses it to win, Player B pays all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds: \n\nHigh-risk discards: Any tile from the same suit as player A's exposed melds.\n\nPlayer A has 3 or 4 sets of the green suit (namely 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of the bamboo suit, and the Green Dragon) exposed. If Player B discards a tile of in this suit and Player A uses it to win, Player B pays all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds: \n\nHigh-risk discards:\nNote: Most Singaporean players do not recognise this hand as a higher-valued hand, and just treat it like a 'Half Flush Hand' (混一色). In this case, 包绿一色 does not come into effect.\n\nPlayer A has 3 or 4 triplets exposed, all of which are of the terminal number one or nine of any suit. If Player B discards a tile of the terminal number one or nine, and Player A uses it to win, Player B pays for all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds: \n\nHigh-risk discards: \n\nOf course, realistically, the high-risk discards are just since the rest have already appeared in Player A's exposed melds and can't form either the triplet or pair when he goes Mahjong.\n\nWhen Player A has 3 Kongs revealed, and Player B discards a tile that has not appeared anywhere on the table (Discard pool & exposed melds), and if Player A manage to perform the 4th Kong and goes Mahjong, Player B pays for all the winnings.\n\n'Fresh tiles' (生牌 \"shēng-pái\") are tiles that have not been discarded.\n\nHowever, exposed tiles from 'Chow' (吃 \"chī\") sets are not considered as 'discarded' tiles. For example, if Player C has a 'Chow' (吃 \"chī\") set of one-two-three 'Character' (万子\"wàn-zǐ\") exposed, and none other of these three 'Character' (万子 \"wàn-zǐ\") tiles are not found in the discard pool, then all these three 'Character' (万子\"wàn-zǐ\") tiles are considered to be 'Fresh' (生\"shēng\") tiles.\n\nAs for 'Pong' (碰 \"pèng\") sets are not considered as 'Fresh' (生牌 \"shēng-pái\") tile since someone did discard it to allow the set to be melded.\n\nThere appears to be variants of the \"\"Definition of Fresh\"\" tile among different players as opposed to the one already mentioned above.\n\nThe variants are:\n\nI.e. to say, if a certain tile is present in one of the melded sets of a player but absent from the discard pool, it will be considered \"fresh\" under the definition of the first variant but not under that of the second variant.\n\nAs mentioned, it will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the below two scenarios are triggered.\n\nThere are fewer than 7 tiles remaining in the wall (excluding the last 15 tiles that are meant to be untouched). If Player B discards a 'Fresh' (生牌 \"shēng-pái\") tile (one not previously discarded) and Player A performs any Kong (杠 \"gàng\") with that discarded tile, Player B pays all the associated compensation that Player A should receive. This has no effect on the payout when the game is won. However, if Player A wins by a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong' (杠上 gàng-shàng) from that discard, Player B will be responsible to pay for all players.\n\nThere are fewer than 5 tiles remaining in the wall (excluding the last 15 tiles that are meant to be untouched). If Player B discards a 'Fresh' tile and Player A wins the game with that tile, Player B pays all winnings payable to Player A for the points he has scored. That is, if Player A wins with a 5-point Hand, Player B will compensate Player A with S$64. Players C and D will not be involved in any payment within this scenario. The description of 'Fresh' (生 \"shēng\") tiles above applies here.\n\nA simple phrase to help remember the number of the tiles remaining for the 'Fresh' tile discard scenarios is simply \"7 tiles \"Pao Kong\",5 Tiles \"Pao Fresh\"\" (七张包杠,五张包生 \"qī-zhang-bāo-gàng, wǔ-zhang-bāo-shēng\").\n\nThere appears to be a variant of the above rule where the number of tiles involved are switched. Thus, for some players, the 'Fresh' Tile Discard Kong Scenario' comes into play when there are less than 5 tiles remaining, while the 'Fresh Discard Scenario' comes into play when there are less than 7 tiles remaining. Thus, the phrase in Note 1 becomes \"7 tiles \"Pao Fresh\", 5 Tiles \"Pao Kong\"\" (七张包生,五张包杠). It will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the scenarios are triggered.\n\nNote: About the 2 'Fresh' tile discard variants above, which is the original version?\n\nPart of the rule: 5 Tiles 'Pao Fresh' (五张包生) in the first version, is also found in Hong Kong, Taiwanese, South African Mahjong variants etc. This means that it is probably very old and is probably originated from China. As for why the additional 7 tiles 'Pao Kong' (七张包杠) is added in Singapore Mahjong, that is because there is Instant Payment for Kong whereas the above other Mahjong variants don't.\n\nTherefore, \"7 tiles \"Pao Kong\", 5 Tiles \"Pao Fresh\"\" (七张包杠, 五张包生) is probably the original version.\n\nIn an event of 'Thirteen Wonders' (十三么), the two above-mentioned 'Fresh' tile discard variants do not apply in the rules.\n\nA scenario where a player claims he has completed his winning hand but in fact, he has not done so or there is a mistake in his hand. This scenario is called Fake or Trick Hand (诈胡 \"zhà-hú\").\n\nUsually he will be penalised to pay 5 points or the Limit to the other three players. The discarder will get double, whereas the other two players get the normal rate. If it is the offender that wrongly claim the \"winning tile\" which he drew it himself, i.e.Self-Pick (自摸 \"zì-mō\"), then he will pays all the three players double.\n\n\"Note 1:\" Usually the penalty for this scenario is 5 points as most players set the Limit to 5 points, but it will be wise to confirm with all playing parties beforehand regarding the penalty when this scenario arises especially when the Limit is more than 5 points.\n\n\"Note 2:\" In the shooter pay scenario, a player who has wrongly claimed a winning hand will only need to compensate the player who discarded the \"winning\" tile. If he/she has 自摸 the wrong winning tile, he/she will have to compensate everyone the winnings equivalent to 5 points (plus $2).\n\nShort Hand is when the offending player has less than 13 tiles in hand, exposed or concealed (Kong is counted as 3 tiles) .\n\nThe penalty will be the offender has forfeited the right to win for the current hand. However, the offender is still allowed to claim Kong for instant payment because unlike Long Hand, Short Hand reduces the chance of Kong with instant payment.\n\nLong Hand is when the offending player (i) has more than 13 tiles in hand, exposed or concealed (Kong is counted as 3 tiles) and/or (ii) has drawn the wrong tile/s from the wall and/or (iii) melded the wrong discarded tile.\n\nWhen detected by other player, the penalties will be the offender has forfeited the rights to win and to claim any Kong for instant payment for the current hand.\n\nNote: \n\n1) For most Mahjong variants, there is no instant payment for Kong. Therefore, their penalty for Long Hand is only the forfeit of the right to win for the current hand. But for Singapore Mahjong, a mistake that causes Long Hand actually increase the chance of Kong with instant payment, that is why the forfeit of the right to claim any Kong is added here so that the offender will not benefit from his mistake.\n\n2) Additional rule Shingou (心狗), an old Japanese Mahjong (Riichi) variant, in the event a player drops a tile from his/her playing hand on accident onto the floor, the guilty player then loses the tile's ownership and the proprietary of that tile will be open to other opposing players to claim by picking it up and adding it to their hand hence revoking both player's winning condition, one having a 大相公 and 小相公. However, this rule is best confirmed with other players before the match.\n\nSingaporean Mahjong uses the Traditional Prohibition Rules concerning Sacred Discard & Missed Discard.\n\nWhen a player discard a certain tile, it will be the Sacred Discard for that player, because he cannot claim the same identical tile from other players' discards for the win or 'Pong' (碰 \"pèng)\" during the very same go around.\n\nFor example, East player discarded a 3 Bamboo without realising that he had a winning hand with 4555 Bamboo. So when South, West or North players discard a 3 Bamboo, he cannot claim it for the win during the very same go around, otherwise it will be considered as a 'Fake Hand' (诈胡 zhà-hú)!\n\nBut he can still claim 4 or 6 Bamboo for the win during the very same go around and when his turn comes, he can still 'Self-Pick' (自摸 zì-mō) 3 Bamboo to win since in Singaporean Mahjong, one does not need to reveal the 'Self-Pick' (自摸 zì-mō) tile.\n\nWhilst the above is the general position, there might be some dispute as to whether the East Player could really claim the 6 Bamboo, as by discarding 3 Bamboo, the other players may likely consider throwing 6 Bamboo as a safe tile. This problem is likely to arise when forming the Sequence Hand (平胡). Hence, it will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the scenarios are triggered.\n\nWhen a player misses a chance to claim a certain tile when another player discards it, he cannot claim the same identical tile from the other players' discards for the win or 'Pong' (碰 \"pèng)\" during the very same go around.\n\nFor example, East player has \"4555 Bamboo\" in his hand, South player discarded a 3 Bamboo. East player did not claim it. So when West or North players discard the very same 3 Bamboo during the very same go around, East player is prohibited to claim for the win, otherwise it will be considered as a 'Fake Hand' (诈胡 zhà-hú)!\n\nBut he can still claim 4 or 6 Bamboo for the win during the very same go around and when his turn comes, he can still 'Self-Pick' (自摸 zì-mō) 3 Bamboo to win.\n\nNote: There might be some dispute with the Sacred & Missed Discards especially with \"the very same go around\". For example, East player misses the chance to claim it, that tile should be either the Sacred or Missed Discard for East player.\n\nNote: In the event where a player is waiting for two different tiles to win (not under the sequence hand), for example, 4 bamboo and white dragon, and the same player missed a discarded tile (say, 4 bamboo), the same player would be entitled to win the game if another player discards the other winning tile (the white dragon) in the same go around. This is because only the tile that the player has missed (4 bamboo) has become a \"missed discard\".\n\nUnless the rule is change from \"Sacred & Missed Discards only valid within the very same go around\" to 'Only valid till his next turn\", then the above scenarios, East player is not allowed to claim it.\n\nAs mentioned, it will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the scenarios are triggered.\n\n\n"}

She placed second behind teammate Ekaterina Serebrianskaya after the first rotation on the rope, but her ball routine score of 9.800 threw her out of the gold medal hunt, and she had to fight for the bronze with Russian rival Amina Zaripova. She was able to take the bronze medal due to Zaripova's mishandling of the ribbon, stepping on it before her final toss. Vitrichenko would later say that she felt that she was robbed of the gold. In the following year she became both the World and the European All-Around champion.\n\nAt the peak of a long and well-publicized feud with the head of the Ukrainian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation, Vitrychenko was placed 17th at the 2000 European Championships in Zaragoza, Spain, and withdrew in protest. After an official evaluation of videotapes determined that certain judges had clearly discriminated against Vitrichenko, the FIG sanctioned the following judges: Natalia Stepanova (Belarus), Gabriele Stummer (Austria), Galina Marjina (Latvia), Ursula Sohlenkamp (Germany), Natalia Lashtsinkaya (Russia), and Ukrainian Irina Diriugina. Although Madame Abruzzini, the then-president of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee, wanted more severe punishment, such as life suspension, the judges were suspended for one year and excluded from a judging course in Rome. Their federations were forced to select other judges for the Sydney Olympics who met the requirements of FIG. The other 26 judges that were at Zaragoza received warnings and were not allowed to judge in Sydney. It was the first time in the sport's history that severe inappropriate behavior was proven and penalized.\n\nAfter the Europeans, Vitrychenko's own federation tried to deny her a spot on the Ukrainian Olympic team in 2000. She appealed to the International Olympic Committee who overturned the decision, and awarded her a spot on the team. She performed well at the Olympics, finishing in fourth place behind Alina Kabaeva.\n\nVitrychenko retired from the sport after the 2000 Sydney Olympics, saying that the omnipresent judging politics would prevent her from achieving further success. She stated that she is not embittered by her controversial placings: \"The most important thing that I have learned in elite sports is to experience other people's victories and to forgive people.\". Over the course of her career, she won a total of nine World titles and ten European titles.\n\nVitrychenko coached rhythmic gymnastics in Spain for ten years. In March 2013, she began coaching at the Illinois Rhythmic Gymnastic Center.\n\nOlena Vitrychenko opened up her own club Vitrychenko Academy on the Chicago Northshore in November 2014.

Harrington is noted for the massive volume of his documentary output, most of which has remained unpublished: the shelf space in the National Anthropological Archives dedicated to his work spans nearly 700 feet.\n\nBorn in Waltham, Massachusetts, Harrington moved to California as a child. From 1902 to 1905, Harrington studied anthropology and classical languages at Stanford University. While attending specialized classes at the University of California, Berkeley, he met anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber. Harrington became intensely interested in Native American languages and ethnography.\n\nRather than completing his doctorate at the Universities of Leipzig and Berlin, Harrington became a high-school language teacher. For three years, he devoted his spare time to an intense examination of the few surviving Chumash people. His exhaustive work came to the attention of the Smithsonian Museum's Bureau of American Ethnology. Harrington became a permanent field ethnologist for the bureau in 1915. He was to hold this position for 40 years, collecting and compiling several massive caches of raw data on native peoples, including the Chumash, Mutsun, Rumsen, Chochenyo, Kiowa, Chimariko, Yokuts, Gabrielino, Salinan, Yuma, and Mojave, among many others. Harrington also extended his work into traditional culture, particularly mythology and geography. His field collections include information on placenames and thousands of photographs. The massive collections were disorganized in the extreme, and contained not only linguistic manuscripts and recordings, but also objects and realia of every stripe; a later cataloger described how opening each box of his legacy was \"an adventure in itself.\"\n\nHarrington is virtually the only recorder of some languages, such as Obispeño (Northern) Chumash, Kitanemuk, and Serrano. He gathered more than 1 million pages of phonetic notations on languages spoken by tribes from Alaska to South America. When the technology became available, he supplemented his written record with audio recordings - many recently digitized - first using wax cylinders, then aluminum discs. He is credited with gathering some of the first recordings of native languages, rituals, and songs, and perfecting the phonetics of several different languages. Harrington's attention to detail, both linguistic and cultural, is well-illustrated in \"Tobacco among the Karuk Indians of California,\" one of his relatively few formally published works.\n\nA more complete listing of the languages he documented includes:\n\n\nHarrington was married to Carobeth Laird (née Tucker) from 1916–1923. They had one daughter, Awona Harrington.\n\n\n"}

In the original formulation, the cues were assumed to have binary values (yes or no) or have an unknown value. The logic of the heuristic is that it bases its choice on the best cue (reason) only and ignores the rest.\n\nGerd Gigerenzer and Daniel Goldstein discovered that the heuristic did surprisingly well at making accurate inferences in real-world environments, such as inferring which of two cities is larger. The heuristic has since been modified and applied to domains from medicine, artificial intelligence, and political forecasting. It has also been shown that the heuristic can accurately model how experts such as airport customs officers and professional burglars make decisions. The heuristic can also predict details of the cognitive process, such as number of cues used and response times, and often better than complex models that integrate all available cues.\n\nTheories of decision making typically assume that all relevant reasons (features or cues) are searched and integrated into a final decision. Yet under uncertainty (as opposed to risk), the relevant cues are typically not all known, nor are their precise weights and the correlations between cues. In these situations, relying only on the best cue available may be a reasonable alternative that allows for fast, frugal, and accurate decisions. This is the logic of a class of heuristics known as “one-reason decision making,” which includes take-the-best. Consider cues with binary values (0, 1), where 1 indicates the cue value that is associated with a higher criterion value. The task is to infer which of two alternatives has the higher criterion value. An example is which of two NBA teams will win the game, based on cues such as home match and who won the last match. The take-the-best heuristic entails three steps to make such an inference:\n\nSearch rule: Look through cues in the order of their validity.\n\nStopping rule: Stop search when the first cue is found where the values of the two alternatives differ.\n\nDecision rule: Predict that the alternative with the higher cue value has the higher value on the outcome variable.\n\nThe validity v of a cue is given by v = C/(C+W), where C is the number of correct inferences when a cue discriminates, and W is the number of wrong inferences, all estimated from samples.\n\nConsider the task to infer which object, A or B, has a higher value on a numerical criterion. As an example imagine someone having to judge whether the German city of Cologne has a larger population than the other German city of Stuttgart. This judgment or inference has to be based on information provided by binary cues, like „Is the city a state capital? From a formal point of view, the task is a categorization: A pair (A, B) is to be categorized as X > X or X > X (where X denotes the criterion), based on cue information.\n\nCues are binary; this means they assume two values and can be modeled, for instance, as having the values 0 and 1 (for \"yes\" and \"no\"). They are ranked according to their cue validity, defined as the proportion of correct comparisons among the pairs A and B, for which it has different values, i.e., for which it discriminates between A and B. Take-the-best analyses each cue, one after the other, according to the ranking by validity and stopping the first time a cue discriminates between the items and concluding that the item with the larger value has also a larger value on the criterion. \nThe matrix of all objects of the reference class, from which A and B have been taken, and of the cue values which describe these objects constitutes a so-called environment. Gigerenzer and Goldstein, who introduced Take-The-Best (see Gerd Gigerenzer & Daniel Goldstein, D. G. (1996) ) considered, as a walk-through example, precisely pairs of German cities. yet only those with more than 100.000 inhabitants. The comparison task for a given pair (A,B) of German cities in the reference class, consisted in establishing which one has a larger population, based on nine cues. Cues were binary-valued, such as whether the city is a state capital or whether it has a soccer team in the national league. \nThe cue values could modeled by 1's (for \"yes\") and 0's (for \"no\") so that each city could be identified with its \"cue profile\", i.e., e vector of 1' and 0's, ordered according to the ranking of cues. \nThe question was: How can one infer which of two objects, for example, \ncity A with cue proﬁle (100101010) and \ncity B with cue proﬁle (100010101), \nscores higher on the established criterion, i.e., population size? \nThe take-the-best heuristic simply compares the profiles lexicographically, just as numbers written in base two are compared: the first cue value is 1 for both, which means that the first cue does not discriminate between A and B. The second cue value is 0 for both, again with no discrimination. The same happens for the third cue value, while the fourth cue value is 1 for A and 0 for B, implying that A is judged as having a higher value on the criterion. \nIn other words, X > X if and only if (100101010) > (100010101) .\nMathematically this means that the cues found for the comparison allow a \"quasi-order isomorphism\" between the objects compared on the criterion, in this case cities with their populations, and their corresponding binary vectors. Here \"quasi\" means that the isomorphism is, in general, not perfect, because the set of cues is not perfect.\n\nWhat is surprising is that this simple heuristic has a great performance compared with other strategies. One obvious measure for establishing the performance of an inference mechanism is determined by the percentage of correct judgements. Furthermore, what matters most is not just the performance of the heuristic when fitting known data, but when generalizing from a known training set to new items.\n\nCzerlinski, Goldstein and Gigerenzer compared several strategies with Take-the-best: a simple Tallying, or unit weight model (also called \"Dawes' Rule\" in that literature), a weighted linear model on the cues weighted by their validties (also called \"Franklin's Rule\" in that literature), Linear Regression, and Minimalist. Their results show the robustness of Take-the-best in generalization.\n\nFor example, consider the task of selecting the bigger city of two cities when \nThe percent correct was roughly 74% for regression, Take-the-best, unit weight linear. More specifically, the scores were 74.3%, 74.2%, and 74.1%, so regression won by a small margin.\n\nHowever, the paper also considered generalization (also known as out-of-sample prediction).\nIn this case, when 10,000 different random splits were used, regression had on average 71.9% correct, Take-the-best had 72.2% correct, and unit with linear had 71.4% correct. The Take-the-best heuristic was more accurate than regression in this case. These results were presented in.\n\n"}

Although a critical and financial failure, it spawned 2 top 10 country hits for Parton.\n\nJake Farris (Dolly Parton), a country singer stuck in a long-term contract performing at \"The Rhinestone\", a sleazy urban cowboy nightclub in New York City, boasts to the club's manager, Freddie (Ron Leibman), that she can make anybody into a country sensation, insisting that she can turn any normal guy into a country singer in just two weeks. Freddie accepts Jake's bet, putting up the remainder of Jake's contract (if she wins the bet, the contract becomes void; if she loses, another five years will be added). He then ups the ante: if Jake loses, she must also sleep with him.\n\nThe problem is that Freddie can select the man, and he selects an obnoxious New York cabbie named Nick Martinelli (Sylvester Stallone). Nick not only has no musical talent whatsoever, he claims to hate country music \"worse than liver\". Realizing she is stuck with Nick, she takes him back to her home in Tennessee to teach him how to walk, talk and behave like a real Country star. While there, he has to put up with Jake's constant nagging and berating him about his behavior, the culture-shock of not knowing anything about the South, and Jake's ex-fiancee Barnett Kale who befriends Nick, then turns on him when he realizes that he and Jake have developed feelings for one another.\n\nIt all leads to Nick performing a song at The Rhinestone where the crowd is a crazed group of hecklers and are \"out for blood.\" After Nick's first attempt to sing bombs, he turns to the band and says, \"Okay guys, let's pick up the beat\" and the band begins playing the song in a more Rock n' Roll version and he wins the crowd over. In the end, Jake gets her contract back and she and Nick begin to sing another song with the implication that they will continue their budding relationship together.\n\nStallone reportedly turned down \"Romancing the Stone\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984) to make \"Rhinestone\". He was paid $5 million and a percentage of the gross.\n\nOriginal screenwriter Phil Alden Robinson was so offended by Stallone's reworking of his original screenplay that he briefly considered having his name removed from the film's credits. He was later convinced that having his name on a film of this \"caliber\" would look good on his resume.\n\nStallone later said:\nThe most fun I ever had on a movie was with Dolly Parton on RHINESTONE. I must tell everyone right now that originally the director was supposed to be Mike Nichols, that was the intention and it was supposed to be shot in New York, down and dirty with Dolly and I with gutsy mannerisms performed like two antagonists brought together by fate. I wanted the music at that time to be written by people who would give it sort of a bizarre edge. Believe it or not, I contacted Whitesnake's management and they were ready to write some very interesting songs alongside Dolly's. But, I was asked to come down to Fox and out steps the director, Bob Clark. Bob is a nice guy, but the film went in a direction that literally shattered my internal corn meter into smithereens. I would have done many things differently. I certainly would've steered clear of comedy unless it was dark, Belgian chocolate dark. Silly comedy didn't work for me. I mean, would anybody pay to see John Wayne in a whimsical farce? Not likely. I would stay more true to who I am and what the audience would prefer rather than trying to stretch out and waste a lot of time and people's patience.\nStallone now says he regrets making the film.\n\nThe film was panned upon its release, and is generally regarded as a commercial and critical flop; on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently has a 15% 'Rotten' rating. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Nonetheless, the soundtrack album gave Dolly Parton two top ten country singles: \"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"God Won't Get You\".\n\n\"Rhinestone\" was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards, winning Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone) and Worst Original Song (\"Drinkenstein\"). The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John J.B. Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of \"The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made\".\n\nPhil Alden Robinson publicly distanced himself from the film during its release, writing to critics complaining about changes made to his script.\n\nThe movie was nominated for a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture.\n\n\n"}

It is the primary means to exchange data such as radar tracking information beyond line of sight. TADIL-A can be used on either high frequency (HF) or ultrahigh frequency (UHF). However, the U.S. Army uses only HF. Link 11 relies on a single platform to report positional information on sensor detections. This positional information can be amplified with additional data to qualify the identity of the detected track. Link 11 was developed by Ralph Benjamin while with the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment (ASWE), Portsmouth.\n\nLink 11 will be replaced by Link 22.\n\nLink 11 is defined by the United States Department of Defense as MIL-STD-6011.\n\nThe NAUTIS (Naval Autonomous Tactical Information System) originally included the Link 11 system as installed in the Royal New Zealand Navy's s as part of the mid-life upgrades in the 1980s HMNZS \"Canterbury\"; NAUTIS versions were also found on the Royal Navy Hunt-class minesweepers. \nLink 11 is a half-duplex, netted link that normally operates by roll call from a Data Net Control Station (DNCS). Link 11 can also operate in the broadcast mode. The roll call mode of operation used in the Link 11 interface requires that each Participating Unit\n(PU) respond in turn while all other stations are receiving. A DNCS initiates the roll call by addressing and transmitting an interrogation message to a specific PU that then responds by transmitting its data. The DNCS then interrogates the next PU in the prescribed roll call. Link 11 can be transmitted on High Frequency (HF) and/or Ultra High Frequency (UHF) bands. Data speed can be selected from bit rates of 2250 or 1364 bits per second (bps). Dual sideband diversity operation and Doppler shift correction features improve reliability and accuracy of data exchange. Link 11 operates\non HF (2-30 MHz) and/or UHF (Line Of Sight (LOS)) (225-400 MHz). Some Data Terminal Sets (DTS) provide the option to select either the Conventional Link 11 Waveform (CLEW) or the Single tone Link 11 Waveform (SLEW). SLEW and CLEW are not compatible waveforms. SLEW, among other enhancements, provides increased propagation and a more powerful Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) algorithm. While the option exists to operate in either CLEW or SLEW, all participants in a given Link 11 net must select the same waveform to achieve connectivity between units. Link 11 is defined in Military Standard (MIL STD) 6011, Tactical Data Link (TDL) A/B Message Standard. \nThe term \"Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL)\" was obsolete (per DISA guidance) and is now more commonly seen as \"Tactical Data Link (TDL)\" .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2238418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238418", "title": "Indian Statistical Institute", "text": "Indian Statistical Institute\n\nIndian Statistical Institute (ISI) is a public research university which is recognized as institute of national importance in 1959 act of the Indian parliament. It grew out of the Statistical Laboratory set up by Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis in Presidency College, Kolkata. Established in 1931, this university of India is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions focused on statistics, and its early reputation led it to being adopted as a model for the first US institute of Statistics set up at the Research Triangle, North Carolina by Gertrude Mary Cox.\n\nMahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was deeply influenced by wisdom and guidance of Rabindranath Tagore and Brajendranath Seal. Under his leadership, the institute initiated and promoted the interaction of Statistics with natural and social sciences to advance the role of Statistics as a key technology by explicating the twin aspectsits general applicability and its dependence on other disciplines for its own development. The institute is now considered as one of the foremost centres in the world for training and research in Computer science, Statistics, Quantitative Economics and related sciences.\n\nISI has its headquarters in Baranagar, Kolkata, West Bengal. It has four subsidiary centres focused in academics at Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Tezpur, and a branch at Giridih. In addition, the Institute has a network of units of Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research at Vadodara, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune engaged in guiding the industries, within and outside India, in developing the most up–to–date quality management systems and solving critical problems of quality, reliability and productivity.\n\nPrimary activities of ISI are research and training of Statistics, development of theoretical Statistics and its applications in various natural and social sciences. Originally affiliated with the University of Calcutta, the institute was declared an institute of national importance in 1959, through an act of Indian parliament, Indian Statistical Institute act, 1959. ISI functions under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) of the Government of India.\n\nKey areas of expertise of ISI are Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Mathematical Economics, Operations Research and Information Science and it is one of the few research oriented Indian schools offering courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level.\n\nISI's origin can be traced back to the Statistical Laboratory in Presidency College, Kolkata set up by Mahalanobis, who worked in the Physics Department of the college in the 1920s. During 1913–15, he did his Tripos in Mathematics and Physics at University of Cambridge, where he came across \"Biometrika\", a journal of Statistics founded by Karl Pearson. Since 1915, he taught Physics at Presidency College, but his interest in Statistics grew under the guidance of polymath Brajendranath Seal. Many colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in Statistics and the group grew in the Statistical Laboratory. Considering the extensive application of Statistics in solving various problems in real life such as analyzing multivariate anthropometric data, applying sample surveys as a method of data collection, analyzing meteorological data, estimating crop yield etc., this group, particularly, Mahalanobis and his younger colleagues S. S. Bose and H. C. Sinha felt the necessity of forming a specialized institute to facilitate research and learning of Statistics.\n\nOn 17 December 1931, Mahalonobis held a meeting with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir R. N. Mukherjee. This meeting led to the establishment of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which was formally registered on 28 April 1932, as a non-profit distributing learned society under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860. Later, the institute was registered under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act XXVI of 1961 amended in 1964. Mukherjee accepted the role of the president of ISI and held this position until his death in 1936. In 1953, ISI was relocated to a property owned by Professor Mahalanobis, named \"Amrapali\", in Baranagar, which is now a municipality at the northern outskirts of Kolkata.\n\nIn 1931, Mahalanobis was the only person working at ISI, and he managed it with an annual expenditure of Rs.250. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues including S. S. Bose, Samarendra Kumar Mitra (Head of the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory and designer of India's first computer), J. M. Sengupta, Raj Chandra Bose, Samarendra Nath Roy, K. R. Nair, R. R. Bahadur, Gopinath Kallianpur, D. B. Lahiri, and Anil Kumar Gain. Pitamber Pant, who had received training in Statistics at the institute, went on to become a secretary to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and was a great source of help and support to the institute.\n\nThe institute started a training section in 1938. In due course, many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the USA or for positions in public/private sector in India. By the 1940s, the ISI was internationally known and was taken as a model when the first institute of Statistics was set up in the United States by Gertrude Coxperhaps the only time an institute in a developing country was used as a model in a developed country.\n\nAs asked by the Government of India, in 1950, ISI designed and planned a comprehensive socio–economic national sample survey covering rural India. The organisation named National Sample Survey (NSS) was founded in 1950 for conducting this survey. The field work was performed by the Directorate of NSS, functioning under the Ministry of Finance, whereas the other tasks such as planning of the survey, training of field workers, review, data processing and tabulation were executed by ISI. In 1961, the Directorate of NSS started functioning under the Department of Statistics of Government of India, and later in 1971, the design and analysis wing of NSS was shifted from ISI to the Department of Statistics forming the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).\n\nJ. B. S. Haldane joined the ISI as a research professor from August 1957, and stayed on until February 1961, when he had a falling out with ISI Director P.C. Mahalanobis over Haldane's going on a much-publicized hunger strike to protest the United States pressuring U.S. National Science Fair winners Gary Botting and Susan Brown from attending an ISI banquet to which many prominent Indian scientists had been invited. Haldane helped the ISI grow in biometrics. Haldane also played a key role in developing the structure and content of the courses offered by ISI.\n\nUntil 1959, ISI was associated with the University of Calcutta. By 'The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959' of the Parliament of India, amended in 1995, ISI was declared an institute of national importance, and was authorised to hold examinations and to grant degrees and diplomas in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Economics, and in any other subject related to Statistics as identified by the Institute from time to time. ISI is a public university, as the same act also states that ISI would be funded by the Central Government of India.\n\nISI had by the 1960s started establishing special service units in New Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad to provide consultancy services to business, industry and governmental public service organisations in the areas of Statistical Process Control, Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. Additionally, Bangalore had a Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC). In the early 1970s, the Delhi and Bangalore units were converted to teaching centres. In 2008, ISI Chennai was upgraded to a teaching centre. In 2011, ISI added a new centre in Tezpur.\n\nISI functions as an autonomous institute under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), which is the nodal ministry of the Government of India that ensures the functioning of ISI in accordance with The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959. ISI Council is the highest policy–making body of the institute. Members of this council include the President of ISI, the Chairman of ISI, representatives of the Government of India including one representative of RBI, scientists not employed in ISI including one representative from the Planning Commission of India and one representative of the UGC, representatives of scientific and non-scientific workers of ISI, and representative from academic staff of ISI, including the Director of ISI and the Dean of Studies of ISI. Bimal Kumar Roy was the Director until 10 June 2015; in a move unique in the history of the Institute, he was removed from his post via a notice posted on the web site of the Ministry of Statistics and Planning.\n\nThe major objectives of the ISI are to facilitate research and training of Statistics, to indulge in development of statistical theory and in application of statistical techniquesin the scenarios of planning at national level and in theoretical development of natural and social sciences, to participate in the process of data collection and analysis, to operate related projects in planning and improvement of efficiency of management and production.\n\nThe Sanskrit phrase भिन्नेष्वैक्यस्य दर्शणम् (Bhinneswaykyasya Darshanam), which literally means the philosophy of unity in diversity, is incorporated in the logo of the institute, and is the motto of ISI.\n\nTraditionally, ISI offers fewer programs (and admits fewer students) than most other degree granting academic institutions. Following the empowerment for granting degrees in the subject of Statistics as per the ISI Act 1959, in 1960, ISI initiated bachelor level degree program Bachelor of Statistics and master level degree course Master of Statistics, and also began awarding research level degrees such as PhD and DSc. Later, ISI started offering Master of Technology (MTech) courses in Computer Science and in Quality, Reliability & Operations Research (QR&OR); these courses got recognition from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). As ISI Act of 1959 was amended by the Parliament of India in 1995, ISI was empowered to confer degrees and diplomas in subjects such as Mathematics, Quantitative Economics, Computer Science, and other subjects related to Statistics and Operations Research as determined by ISI from time to time. Apart from the degree courses, ISI offers few diploma and certificate courses, special diploma courses for international students via ISEC, and special courses in collaboration with CSO for training probationary officers of Indian Statistical Service (ISS).\n\nISI offers two undergraduate programs, viz. Bachelor of Statistics (Honours) (B.Stat) and Bachelor of Mathematics (Honours) (B. Math), seven graduate programs, viz. Master of Statistics (M. Stat), Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science in Quantitative Economics (MSQE), Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MSLIS), Master of Science in Quality Management Science (MSQMS), Master of Technology in Computer Science (MTech–CS), Master of Technology in Cryptology & Security (MTech-CrS) and Master of Technology in Quality, Reliability and Operations Research (MTech–QROR).\n\nISI also offers three PG Diploma programs, viz. Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications (PGDCA), Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), and P.G. Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics. It also offers research fellowships towards obtaining a PhD degree. The Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA) is a unique, tri-institute program being held in collaboration with IIM Calcutta and IIT Kharagpur, with an aim to nurture and develop highly skilled business analytical professionals. It has been ranked 14th worldwide, according to 2019 QS World Universities Rankings.\n\nUndergraduate courses are of 3 years duration, whereas the graduate level courses of 2 years of duration. For all undergraduate and graduate level courses, the academic year is divided in two semesters. Except for sponsored candidates of MTech courses, ISI students are not required to pay any tuition fees. Conditional to performance beyond a threshold, all students and research fellows receive stipends, fellowships and contingency/book grants. Students demonstrating outstanding performances are rewarded at the end of the semesters. ISI campuses provide hostel accommodations with recreational facilities and limited medical facilities available free of cost.\n\nApplicants of all degree courses are required to go through written admission tests and interviews. ISI conducts the written tests at various examination centres across India. Only in few cases, candidates may get called for the interview directly, viz. applicants of MTech Computer Science course having a GATE score above a threshold. Candidates applying to doctoral research programmes who have been awarded (or qualified for) a Junior Research Fellowship by UGC / CSIR / NBHM etc are also required to clear the ISI admission test or an equivalent separate test and interview conducted by the relevant JRF selection committee of the institute if they wish to obtain a Ph.D from Indian Statistical Institute.\n\nIn 1950, ISI, in collaboration with International Statistical Institute, UNESCO and Government of India, had set up International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC) to impart knowledge of theoretical and applied statistics to participants from Middle East, East and South-East Asia, the Far East and Commonwealth countries of Africa. The main training course offered by ISEC is meant for international students, preferably graduates with proficiency in English and Mathematics. ISEC, located in Kolkata campus of ISI, functions with support from the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation of the Government of India.\n\n\"Sankhya\", the statistical journal published by ISI, was founded in 1933, along the lines of Karl Pearson's \"Biometrika\". Mahalanobis was the founder editor. Each volume of \"Sankhya\" consists of four issues; two of them are in Series A, containing articles on theoretical statistics, probability theory and stochastic processes, and the other two issues form the Series B, containing articles on applied statistics, i.e. applied probability, applied stochastic processes, econometrics and statistical computing.\n\nAccording to India Education Review, no Indian university is in the world's top 200 universities. The ascribed ranking of ISI is 386. The web ranking of this institute, according to 4ICU (4 International Colleges and Universities), is 1693. According to the web ranking published by Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, ISI currently holds the world rank of 1352. In the subject-wise academic world ranking of Computer Science, Indian Statistical Institute features in 101—150 category. The Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata is ranked 2nd in Computer Science research by mean citation rate, p-Index, h-index among all universities in India.\n\nOver the years, researchers of ISI made fundamental contributions in various fields of Statistics such as Design of Experiments, Sample Survey, Multivariate statistics and Computer Science. Mahalanobis introduced the measure Mahalanobis distance which is used in multivariate statistics and other related fields. Raj Chandra Bose, who is known for his contributions in coding theory, worked on Design of Experiments during his tenure at ISI, and was one of the three mathematicians, who disproved Euler's conjecture on orthogonal Latin squares. Anil Kumar Bhattacharya is credited with introduction of the measures Bhattacharyya distance and Bhattacharya coefficient. Samarendra Nath Roy is known for his pioneering contributions in multivariate statistics. Among colleagues of Mahalanobis, other notable contributors were K. R. Nair in Design of experiments, Jitendra Mohan Sengupta in Sample Survey, Ajit Dasgupta in Demography and Ramkrishna Mukherjea in Quantitative Sociology. C. R. Rao's contributions during his association with ISI include two theorems of Statistical Inference known as Cramér–Rao inequality and Rao-Blackwell Theorem, and introduction of orthogonal arrays in Design of Experiments. Anil Kumar Gain is known for his contributions to the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient with his colleague Sir Ronald Fisher at the University of Cambridge.\n\nIn 1953, India's first indigenous computer was designed by Samarendra Kumar Mitra who headed the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory at ISI Calcutta. The Indian Statistical Institute was also hosted the first two digital computers in South Asia; the HEC-2M from England in 1956, and the URAL from the Soviet Union in 1959. These were also among the earliest digital computers in Asia (outside Japan).\n\nDuring 1953 - 1956 distinguished scientists, like Ronald Fisher, Norbert Wiener and Yuri Linnik visited ISI. Norbert Wiener collaborated with Gopinath Kallianpur on topics including ergodic theory, prediction theory and generalized harmonic analysis. In 1962, during his month-long visit to ISI, Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov wrote his notable paper on Kolmogorov complexity, which was published in Sankhya, 1963. Other distinguished scientists including Jerzy Neyman, Walter A. Shewhart, W. Edwards Deming and Abraham Wald have visited ISI during the tenure of P. C. Mahalanobis.\n\nThe second five-year plan of India was a brainchild of Mahalanobis. The plan followed the Mahalanobis model, an economic development model developed by Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted to determine the optimal allocation of investment between productive sectors in order to maximise long-run economic growth . It used the prevalent state of art techniques of operations research and optimisation as well as the novel applications of statistical models developed at ISI. This second five-year plan shifted the focus from agriculture to industrialisation, with an objective of attaining self-reliance by economy of India. Domestic production of industrial products was encouraged in this plan, particularly in the development of the public sector. The two-pronged strategy devised in this plan targeted rapid growth of the heavy industry, keeping emphasis on growth of small and cottage industries.\n\nB. S. Minhas and K. S. Parikh, both from the Planning Unit of ISI Delhi, played key roles in the Planning Commission of the Government of India. Minhas, who joined the Planning Unit in 1962 and retired as a distinguished scientist in 1989, was a member of the Planning Commission during 1971–74. Parikh, who was a member of the Planning Commission during 2004–09, chaired Integrated Energy Policy Committee of the commission, was a member of the Economic Advisory Council of India during the tenure of five prime ministers, also played a role in the Department of Atomic Energy establishment, and was a key advisor to the government on energy issues.\n\nIn India, the first analog computer was designed by Samarendra Kumar Mitra and built by Ashish Kumar Maity at ISI in 1953, for use in computation of numerical solutions of simultaneous linear equations using a modified version of Gauss-Siedel iteration. In 1955, the first digital computer of India was procured by ISI. This machine was of a model named HEC-2M, manufactured by British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM). As per the agreement with BTM, ISI had to take care of the installation work and maintenance of it, before it became operational in 1956. Though this HEC-2M machine and the URAL-1 machine, which was bought in 1959 from Russia, were operational till 1963, ISI began development of the first second-generation digital computer of India in collaboration with Jadavpur University (JU). This joint collaboration led by the head of the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory at ISI, Samarendra Kumar Mitra, produced the transistor-driven machine ISIJU-1, which became operational in 1964. The first annual convention of the Computer Society of India (CSI) was hosted by ISI in 1965. The Computer and Communication Sciences division of ISI produced many eminent scientists such as Samarendra Kumar Mitra (its original founder), Dwijesh Dutta Majumdar, Sankar Kumar Pal, Bidyut Baran Chaudhuri, Nikhil R. Pal, Bhabani P. Sinha, Bhargab B. Bhattacharya, Malay K. Kundu, Sushmita Mitra, Bhabatosh Chanda, C. A. Murthy, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay and many. ISI is regarded as one of the top most centres for research in computer science in India and attracts some of the best students in the country.\n\nThe Knowledge-based Computer Systems project (KBCS), funded jointly by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DoE), Government of India and UNDP since 1986, has a nodal centre at ISI Kolkata. This unit is responsible for research in the area of image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision and artificial intelligence.\n\nR. L. Brahmachari, known for his work in many fields like agricultural sciences, zoology, botany, biometrics, did much of his work at ISI.\n\nThe institute has done some pioneering work and research in anthropology and palaeontology. A trove of dinosaur fossils was discovered by a team led by ISI researchers in the early 1960s. The scattered fossils were recovered and the partial skeleton was reconstructed at ISI's Baranagar campus. It turned out to be a unique species and was named the \"\", after Rabindranath Tagore and was mounted in the Geology Museum at the Kolkata Campus of the Institute.\n\nThe Linguistic Research Unit (LRU) of ISI was involved in the study of speech pathology. Đorđe Kostić of this laboratory was a distinguished scientist. He invented a unique hearing aid, called SAFA (Selective Auditory Frequency Amplifier) that simulates frequency-range according to the need of the particular hearing impaired person.\n\nMany students and research scholars of ISI pursued a career in academics, and have excelled in the fields of statistics, mathematics, probability theory, computer science and economics. In statistics alumni of ISI who have been elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association include P. V. Sukhatme (1950) and K. R. Nair (1951). There are many other notable ones including Samarendra Kumar Mitra, S. R. S. Varadhan, Debabrata Basu, K. R. Parthasarathy, Jayanta Kumar Ghosh, Bimal K. Roy, Sankar Kumar Pal, B. L. S. Prakasa Rao, G. Jogesh Babu, Thiruvenkatachari Parthasarathy, Gopinath Kallianpur, Rajeeva Karandikar, Ravindra Khattree, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay, Palash Sarkar, J. S. Rao, Kesar Singh, Ranajit Chakraborty, Partha Pratim Majumder, Probal Chaudhuri, Arup Bose, Debashish Goswami, Ritabrata Munshi, Sourav Chatterjee, Jean Drèze, Sucharit Sarkar. ISI alumni notable for non-academic career include politicians Subramanian Swamy and Dipankar Bhattacharya.\n\nSoviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited ISI during his visit to India in 1955. Zhou Enlai, the Prime Minister of China, and Ho Chi Minh, the President of Vietnam, during their visit to India specifically visited ISI respectively on 9 September 1956 and 13 February 1958.\n\nISI has its headquarters and the main campus in Kolkata. It has other centres in New Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and smaller units in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Coimbatore, Giridih, Pune and Vadodara. Tezpur, the 4th centre of ISI was inaugurated in 2011.\n\nSince mid-forties, ISI pioneered in research and application of Statistical Quality Control (SQC) in India. Walter A. Shewhart, the statistician known as \"the father of SQC\", and other experts of this field visited ISI over the years. The first Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research (SQC & OR) unit of ISI was set up in Mumbai in 1953, followed by Bangalore and Kolkata units in 1954. In 1976, this unit was transformed into the SQC & OR Division, which now operates eight units, located at various industrial centres in IndiaKolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Coimbatore and Vadodara. These units partake in technical consultancy with public and private organisations, in addition with performing research and training activities.\n\nThe branch at Giridih was set up in 1931 and it has two operational units, viz. the Sociological Research Unit and the Agricultural Research Unit.\n\nISI Kolkata has a campus consisting of six addresses at 201 through 206 Barrackpore Trunk Road, Baranagar. These include a house, which was an erstwhile office of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) of India.\n\nISI Kolkata campus is eco-friendly, as conceived by Mahalanobis. Hollow bricks that protect from heat and noise were used with minimum use of reinforced concrete, to avoid radiation. There was no use of bitumen-basalt combination at the roads inside ISI campuses. This helps in reduction of radiation and preservation of rain water to maintain equilibrium in ground-water level.\n\nThe Kolkata campus offers bachelors level degree course in Statistics (B. Stat), master's degree course in Statistics (M.Stat), Mathematics (M.Math), Computer Science (MTech), Cryptology & Security (MTech), Quality Reliability and Operations Research (MTech) and Quantitative Economics (M.S.). Major divisions and units are: Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU), Human Genetics Unit (HGU), Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit (PAMU), Geological Studies Unit (GSU), Advanced Computation and MicroElectronics Unit (ACMU), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit (CVPRU), Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU), Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit (ECSU), Applied Statistics Unit (ASU), Economic Research Unit (ERU), Linguistic Research Unit (LRU), Sociology Research Unit (SRU), Psychometry Research Unit (PRU) and Population Studies Unit (PSU).\n\nThe Kolkata campus houses the International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC), which opened in 1950. This Centre provides training in statistics to sponsored students mainly from the Middle East, South and South East Asia, the Far East and the Commonwealth Countries of Africa. The Centre also offers various short-term courses in statistics and related subjects.\n\nThe Center for Soft Computing Research: A National Facility, an associate institute of Indian Statistical Institute and established in Kolkata in 2005, is unique in the country. Apart from conducting basic research, it offers a 3-month course and promotes less endowed institutes by providing fellowships and research grants.\n\nThe Central Library of ISI is located at Kolkata with branches at the other facilities. The library has over 200,000 volumes of books and journals with a special emphasis on the field of statistics and related studies. The main branch also has a collection of official reports, reprints, maps, and microfilms. The library receives over a thousand new technical and scientific journals every year. The Library has databases on CD-ROM and is working on further digitization of the collection. The library has a separate collection of works on the topics of mathematics and statistics called the Eastern Regional Centre of NBHM collection, funded by grants from the National Board for Higher Mathematics.\n\nThe ISI campus at New Delhi was established in 1974 and was shifted to the present campus in 1975.\n\nThe Delhi campus offers two master level courses Master of Statistics (M. Stat) and Master of Science (M. S.) in Quantitative Economics, and doctoral programs.\n\nThe Bangalore Centre of ISI started with a Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research (SQC&OR) unit in 1954. The Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC) here became operational from 1962 with honorary professor S. R. Ranganathan as the head. Prof. Mahalanobis planned of starting a full-fledged centre of ISI here around the mid-sixties. In 1966, the then Government of Karnataka granted ISI 30 acres of forest land full of eucalyptus trees, next to the upcoming campus of the Bangalore University, located on the Mysore Road on the outskirts of the city.\n\nHowever, after death of Prof. Mahalanobis in 1972, the project of establishing Bangalore centre got temporarily shelved. The project was again revived during 1976–78. Concrete proposals were made to the Government of India to get grants for the development of the land already in possession of ISI, along with the construction of an academic block with a library and offices.\n\nIn the meantime, a building was rented on Church Street, in Bangalore downtown, and various activities of the Bangalore Centre started in September 1978. The Economic Analysis Unit (EAU) and the Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU) were established. The SQC&OR Unit and the DRTC unit, which were functioning from other rented buildings at that time, joined this new Centre.\n\nAs construction of the administrative block at the new campus got completed, the various units moved to the new campus in May 1985. The sprawling green wooded Campus has Residential Facility for students, faculty and staff.\n\nThe Bangalore centre was formally declared as a centre of ISI in September 1996.\n\nThe Systems Science and Informatics Unit (SSIU) was established in 2009\n\nThe Bangalore centre has by now became an institution well known for its academic activities in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, SQC and Operations Research, Library and Information Science, and Quantitative Economics.\n\nThe Bangalore campus offers bachelor level course Bachelor of Mathematics (B. Math), master level courses Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science (M. S.) in Library and Information Science and Master of Science (M. S.) in Quality Management Science, and doctoral programs.\n\nIntegration is the annual techno-cultural fest of Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata usually held during the first and second weekend of January each year. It is one of the biggest student fests in Kolkata, and attracts participation from all over the world. Also the performances of great artists are always a center of attraction for all.\n\nChaos is the annual techno-cultural fest of Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore usually held during the last weekend of March each year.

After being involved in the works to the Port of Antwerp, Bernard served (1809–1812) as aide-de-camp to Napoléon. Promoted to colonel in 1813, he was wounded in the retreat after the battle of Leipzig and distinguished himself the same year (1813) in the gallant three month defense of the besieged city of Torgau against the allies. \n\nAfter Napoléon's first abdication he rallied to the Bourbons and was promoted to general de brigade by Louis XVIII of France and made a knight of Saint Louis. Bernard was tasked by the minister of war Clarke with topographical work. After Napoléon's return from Elba, Bernard rallied to the emperor and took part in the battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nAfter the emperor's second abdication he was banished from France and, refusing an offer for employment from czar Alexander I of Russia, he emigrated to the United States, where he was accepted as an assistant engineer with the rank and pay of a brigadier-general of engineers on November 16, 1816.

He left school at 16 and started work the next day with no qualifications. During his tenure of ASLEF, most members saw their real earnings rise by an average of 6% per annum, and their working week cut to an average of 35 hours, and with many working a four-day week.. He fought for the safety of his members, and the inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash led by Lord Cullen. He got into trouble with Cullen, when he was quoted in the press stating that leading counsel for Railtrack were lying to cover up their negligence about the cause of the Ladbroke Grove crash. Rix refused to apologise, stating to do so would dishonour the memories of his deceased members.\n\nThere is a plaque and a tree outside Euston station which Rix planted to celebrate the memories of those killed in railway disasters. Rix founded the group Take Back the Track, which was successful in turning Railtrack into a not-for-profit publicly owned company in 2001. Rix's defeat in the election for General Secretary of ASLEF by Shaun Brady, a relatively right wing candidate, came as a great surprise to the left wing of the trade union movement. It was widely claimed that those in New Labour and the railway companies had a hand in his defeat. The defeat led to a period of instability in ASLEF culminating in a brawl at a barbecue at the union's London headquarters, which resulted in a number of senior officers being removed from their positions, including Brady.\n\nRix is currently a National Officer with the GMB Union responsible for relationships with DHL. He also leads the union on all transport and aviation matters, including Yodel, BA, Servisair, Menzies, BMI, the private hire taxi industry and ASDA Distribution.\n\nRix joined the Labour Party in February 1980. He created the left-wing FUWL group (Fed Up With Losing) in 1999 after a discussion with Kenny Cameron, Alan Sapper and Ken Gill. The group became more widely known in the public and media as the \"awkward squad\", after journalist Kevin Maguire coined the term in an article in \"The Guardian\" in 2001, in which he also reported that Rix had recently rejoined Labour after a period in the Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party. Rix insisted that the FUWL group had not to ape the left of the old days but had to include a senior officer, senior lay member and a trusted staffer, so that the decisions made at FUWL meetings would go through the various networks of union internal structures. FUWL insisted that it was not the preserve of males, and included the very powerful TUC women's network, along with the editor of the \"Morning Star\". FUWL became a powerful block on the TUC. FUWL basically wrote the policy agenda and in 2001 it ended the right wing dominance at the TUC on policy, and in winning elections to the general council elections in a number of unions. FUWL worked with the Campaign Group of MPs on a whole host of projects.\n\nRix was responsible for creating the influential Justice for Colombia (JFC) group in late 2000, which helped raise awareness of the deaths and murders of trade unionists taking place in the country. When Rix formed this influential group within the British trade union movement, there were over 250 trade unionists being murdered in Colombia each year. By the time Rix had moved on, this figure had been cut to around 50 to 70 a year, with regular visits and fact finding missions to Colombia taking place by leading trade unionists, journalists, solicitors, politicians, and NGOs. Rix even met the Vice President, later President, Juan Manuel Santos, and berated him over the impunity involved in the murders. Nearly every trade union in the UK plays an active part in JFC.\n\nRix, along with others, was a founder of the Stop the War Coalition, but later resigned from the organisation. He spoke at most of STWC's large popular demonstrations. He is also active in the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, has visited Cuba many times, has met with many leading Cubans, including Castro, and holds the Workers' Central Union of Cuba (CTC) medal, and the Che Guevara medal, presented to him by the general secretary of the Cuban CTC. \n\nRix also helped Denis Goldberg, the South African anti-apartheid activist, with his activities with the Woodcraft Folk on numerous occasions, until his return to South Africa. Rix has visited many countries meeting leading trade unionists and politicians.\n\nBorn in the West Riding of Yorkshire but raised in Leeds, Rix has three children.

{"id": "2238452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238452", "title": "Baughurst", "text": "Baughurst\n\nBaughurst is a village and civil parish in Hampshire, England. It is located west of the town of Tadley, north of Basingstoke. In the 2001 census it had a population of 2,473.\n\nThe village is known for its feud with Tadley in the manufacture of besom brooms.\n\nA number of tumuli are in the parish, suggesting that a settlement may have been in the Baughurst area in the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Roman times. Portway, the Roman road between London (\"Londinium\") and Dorchester (\"Durnovaria\") via nearby Silchester (\"Calleva Atrebatum\"), ran through the parish. The recorded history of Baughurst traces to Anglo Saxon Britain. In 885, the area was given to the Bishop of Winchester, and became part of Hurstbourne Priors near Andover. Baughurst was not mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086; it was probably still part of Hurstbourne Priors. During the late 13th century, a number of tithings within Baughurst were held by the Coudray family on behalf of Edward I.\n\nIn 1440, Baughurst became part of the Manor of Manydown near Basingstoke. In the mid-16th century, Baughurst's tithings were bought by the Palmes family. Around the same time, the Dissolution of the Monasteries occurred and Aldermaston returned to Winchester Cathedral in 1541. It later swapped to Manydown once more, before being sold in 1649 and returned to Winchester in 1660. After the Civil War, the area became one of the wealthiest Quaker centres in the south of England. After George Fox's visit to Basingstoke in 1657, a dissident – James Potter – was imprisoned for standing up in church and reading from a Quaker paper which conflicted with standard church beliefs. After his release, Potter established a Friends meeting house in the village. After the Act of Toleration 1689, Baughurst became less valuable to the Quakers – many joined the Anglicans. The majority, however, began following the Methodist movement of John and Charles Wesley, who regularly visited Baughurst. The Wesleys' friend, George Whitefield, lived in Baughurst around 1736.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Jane Austen (who lived in nearby Steventon) visited Baughurst Priory. She wrote about her visit in a letter to her sister Cassandra.\n\nIn 1847, Baughurst became part of the Duke of Wellington's Stratfield Saye estate. The subsequent dukes were the main land owners of Baughurst until 1943. In 1942, land was cleared to build RAF Aldermaston. One of the RAF base's hangars, located at Baughurst Plantation, was used to assemble Spitfires. Between 1943 and 1945, the plant produced approximately 500 photo-reconnaissance aircraft, including Mark IX and XIX. It also produced some Mark IX and XIV fighter aircraft. Over the next 30 years, the parish's population grew from 490 to 2,250. This because of the RAF base and, later, the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment.\n\nA number of explanations for the name \"Baughurst\" exist. \"Hurst\" was Old English for a thick wood or wooded hill. \"Baughurst\" may either refer to the wood inhabited by a Saxon named Beagga, or by badgers; \"wood of the badgers\". The latter is referred to in the name of one of the village's pubs, \"The Badger's Wood\".\n\nA number of alternative spellings of Baughurst have been recorded, including \"Bagganhyrst\" (11th century), \"Baggehurst\" (12th century), \"Bagehurst\" (15th century), \"Baugust\" (18th century), and \"Baghurst\" (19th century).\n\nBaughurst is in area, and is neighboured by a number of parishes in Berkshire and Hampshire:\nThe tithings of Ham and Inhurst are within the parish; they were first recorded in 1298. Baughurst Brook, which is a tributary of the River Enborne, is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest.\n\nBaughurst is situated on a natural ridge between Silchester and Brimpton Common. The ridge, which is situated towards the north of the parish, is approximately above sea level. Moving south through the parish, the land drops by to Baughurst Brook, before rising to at the northern edge of the North Hampshire Downs. The brook leaves the lower land in the parish liable to flooding. The soil and subsoil of the area are clay. The Brook travels East to eventually become the Foudry Brook. Some tributaries of the River Enborne are also found in the area around Baughurst.\n\nAlong with Tadley, Baughurst is associated with the manufacture of besom brooms. Historically, much of the land in the parish was heathland used to grow birch trees, which were taken to Tadley to manufacture the brooms.\n\nBuilt in 1937, Lattice House was originally the depot for Kent's Buses and was built with a single span wooden Belfast truss roof. It was used for the storage of Spitfire aircraft parts during 1943–1945, which were assembled at the neighbouring RAF Aldermaston. At one time the building's arched roof was the largest single-span wooden roof in Western Europe.\n\nThe Hurst Community College is in the village, and provides secondary education for students between the ages of 11 and 16. It is the main secondary school in the Tadley area. Aside from one independent school, the parish's primary education is in nearby Tadley.\n\nThe parish church is dedicated to Saint Stephen, and is in the Diocese of Winchester. The church consists of a chancel, vestry, nave and a tower. The tower, which is tall, forms part of the porch. It is built in flint and incorporates earlier materials. The bell tower houses five bells, all of which were cast by Thomas Swaine in 1775.\n\nThe current church was built by Benjamin Ferrey in 1845 on the site of an earlier (possibly 12th century) chapel, which had partially collapsed the same year. Baughurst had a Primitive Methodist Church between 1872 and 1987. The Quakers established a meeting house at Brown's Farm in the mid 17th century, which operated until 1791.\n\nBaughurst AFC, the village's association football club, used to play in Tadley. AFC Aldermaston train and play at the Atomic Weapons Establishment on the Baughurst-Tadley border.\n\n"}

With 900 stage roles to his credit, he became one of the most successful actors in the developing field of radio drama. A friend and associate of Orson Welles for many years, Collins went to Hollywood with the Mercury Theatre company and made his feature-film debut in \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), as Kane's ruthless political rival. Collins appeared in more than 75 films and had one of his best-remembered roles on television, as the disarming but determined police Lieutenant Arthur Tragg on the television series \"Perry Mason\".\n\nRay Bidwell Collins was born December 10, 1889, in Sacramento, California, to Lillie Bidwell and William Calderwood Collins. His father was a newspaper reporter and dramatic editor on \"The Sacramento Bee\". His mother was the niece of John Bidwell, pioneer, statesman, and founder of society in the Sacramento Valley area of California in the 19th century. Collins was inspired as a young boy to become an actor after seeing a stage performance by his uncle, Ulric Collins, who had performed the role of Dave Bartlett in the Broadway production of \"Way Down East\". He began putting on plays with neighborhood children in Sacramento.\nCollins made his professional stage debut at age 13, at the Liberty Playhouse in Oakland, California.\n\nIn December 1912, Collins and his first wife Margaret Marriott were a vaudeville team who performed at the Alhambra Theater in Seattle. In July 1914, the couple and their young son Junius moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where Collins worked as an actor. In 1922, he was part of a stock company called Vancouver's Popular Players which enacted plays at the original Orpheum Theatre. He operated his own stock company for five years at his own theatre, the Empress Theatre in Vancouver. Collins toured in vaudeville and made his way to New York.\n\nCollins worked prodigiously in his youth. Between the ages of 17 and 30, he was said to have been out of work as an actor for a total of five weeks. In 1924, he and Margaret Marriott divorced. That same year, he opened in \"Conscience\" and, after that, he was almost continually featured in Broadway plays and other theatrical productions until the Great Depression began. In 1926 he married Joan Uron. At the start of the Depression, Collins turned his attention to radio, where he was involved in 18 broadcasts a week, sometimes working as many as 16 hours a day. He also played parts in short films starting in 1930, notably in a Vitaphone Varieties series based on Booth Tarkington's Penrod stories.\n\nIn 1934, Collins began a long association with Orson Welles that led to some of his most memorable roles. They met when Welles joined the repertory cast of \"The American School of the Air\", his first job on the radio. In 1935, Welles won a place in the prestigious company that presented the news dramatization series \"The March of Time\"—an elite corps of actors that included Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloane, Paul Stewart, and others who would soon form the core of Welles's Mercury Theatre.\n\nOn radio, Collins was in the distinguished repertory cast of the weekly historical drama \"Cavalcade of America\" for six years. Collins and Welles worked together on that series and others, including Welles's serial adaptation of \"Les Misérables\" (1937) and \"The Shadow\" (1937–38).\n\nCollins became a member of the repertory company of Welles's CBS Radio series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" (1938) and its sponsored continuation, \"The Campbell Playhouse\" (1938–40). Through the run of the series, Collins played many roles in literary adaptations, from Squire Livesey in \"Treasure Island\", to Dr. Watson in \"Sherlock Holmes\", to Mr. Pickwick in \"The Pickwick Papers\". Collins' best known (albeit uncredited) work on this series, however, was in \"The War of the Worlds\", the celebrated broadcast in which he played three roles, most notably the rooftop newscaster who describes the destruction of New York.\n\nAlong with other Mercury Theatre players, Collins made his feature film debut in \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), in which he portrayed ruthless political boss Jim W. Gettys. He appeared in Welles's original Broadway production of \"Native Son\" (1941) and also played a principal role in Welles's second film, \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). His ongoing radio work included Welles's wartime series, \"Ceiling Unlimited\" and \"Hello Americans\" (1942), and the variety show, \"The Orson Welles Almanac\" (1944).\n\nHaving returned to his native California, Collins appeared in more than 75 major motion pictures, including \"Leave Her to Heaven\" (1945), \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), \"Crack-Up\" (1946), \"A Double Life\" (1947), two entries in the Ma and Pa Kettle series, and the 1953 version of \"The Desert Song\", in which he played the non-singing role of Kathryn Grayson's father. He displayed comic ability in \"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer\" (1947), and \"The Man from Colorado\" (1949), and played a supporting role in Welles's \"Touch of Evil\" (1958).\n\nOn television, Collins was a regular in \"The Halls of Ivy\" (1954–55), starring Ronald Colman. He appeared as Judge Harper in a 1955 TV adaptation of the holiday classic, \"Miracle on 34th Street\", starring Thomas Mitchell, Teresa Wright, and MacDonald Carey. In 1957 Collins joined the cast of the CBS-TV series \"Perry Mason\" and gained fame as Los Angeles police homicide detective Lieutenant Arthur Tragg.\n\nBy 1960, Collins found his physical health declining and his memory waning, problems which in the next few years brought an end to his career. On the difficulty he was beginning to encounter in remembering his lines, he commented, \"Years ago, when I was on the Broadway stage, I could memorize 80 pages in eight hours. I had a photographic memory. When I got out on the stage, I could actually — in my mind — see the lines written on top of the page, the middle, or the bottom. But then radio came along, and we read most of our lines, and I got out of the habit of memorizing. I lost my natural gift. Today it's hard for me. My wife works as hard as I do, cueing me at home.\"\n\nIn October 1963, Collins filmed his last \"Perry Mason\" episode, \"The Case of the Capering Camera\", broadcast January 16, 1964. Although clearly Collins would not return to work on the series, his name appeared in the opening title sequence through the eighth season, which ended in May 1965. Executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson was aware that Collins watched the show every week and did not wish to discourage him.\n\nOn July 11, 1965, Collins died of emphysema at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California, at age 75. Masonic services were held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.\n\nRay Collins played 900 roles on the legitimate stage.\n\n"}

Though the Rectory in which she wrote \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Sense and Sensibility\" was pulled down around 1824, the site is still marked by an old lime tree that is believed to have been planted by her eldest brother, James, who took over the parish from his father.\n\nThe 12th-century church of St Nicholas, where the Austens were rectors and Jane worshipped, stands little changed from their day.

The society originated as a consequence of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and what the members perceived as a subsequent increase in the criticism of Stalin. According to the Stalin Society's website, \"[t]he Stalin Society was formed in 1991 to defend Stalin and his work on the basis of fact and to refute capitalist, revisionist, opportunist and Trotskyist propaganda directed against him\".\n\nThe society is based on individual membership but political groups such as the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist), and the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist) are notably prominent within it. Many have pointed to a considerable overlap of membership with Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party, including Scargill himself. The Stalin Society's chair, Harpal Brar, for instance, was at one time a member of both organisations (although he subsequently left the SLP to head the CPGB-ML). Through Brar, the society was also linked to the Association of Communist Workers. One of the Stalin Society's founders, Bill Bland, was expelled in an organizational dispute. Kamal Majid, a founding member of the Stalin Society, is a patron of the Stop the War Coalition.\n\nThe Stalin Society puts forward unconventional views on events such as the Holodomor, a famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932–33, the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union in 1936–38, and the Katyn massacre, a mass execution of Polish figures in 1940. The responsibility for these events is generally ascribed to the NKVD during the time of Stalin’s leadership, but articles published online by the Stalin Society deny this, citing Nikolai Yezhov, and not Stalin as responsible.\n\nThe Holodomor is said to have resulted from poor weather conditions and sabotage by rich peasants. The belief that Stalin intentionally brought the famine about in order to break the Ukrainian national spirit is attributed to 1930s anti-Soviet propaganda perpetuated by Ukrainian nationalists and McCarthyists. The Great Purge is regarded as a fair legal process designed to thwart an anti-Soviet coup, for which the numbers of imprisoned and dead have been exaggerated by anti-Soviet propagandists. The Katyn Massacre is said to have been committed by Nazi German forces who captured Polish prisoners of war held by the Soviets. Nazi propaganda is said to have been responsible for its attribution to the Soviets.\n\nThe society continues to hold public meetings. The Stalin Society has produced many booklets on subjects including CPSU purges, famines and George Orwell.\n\nThe \"Stalin Society of Pakistan\" was formed in 2013 and has a website and Facebook account. The society has claimed on Facebook that it \"stands for communist revolution in Pakistan\" and on its website it states that it is \"not a political party but an academic venture\" which aims to \"refute anti-Stalin propaganda and revisionism\". Stalin Societies have also been formed in the United States and Canada, Tunisia, India, Italy, Ireland, and Argentina, and an International Stalin Society was formed in 2014.\n\n\n"}

The equivalent of the Communist Party in East Germany was the \"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED), which along with other parties, was part of the National Front of Democratic Germany. It was created in 1946 through the merger of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany. Following German reunification, the SED was renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS).\n\nThe other political parties ran under the joint slate of the National Front, controlled by the SED, for elections to the \"Volkskammer\", the East German parliament. The other parties were:\n\n\nElections were held but were effectively controlled by the SED and state hierarchy, as noted by Hans Modrow and others.\n\nThe \"Volkskammer\" also included representatives from the \"mass organisations\" like the Free German Youth (\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\" or \"FDJ\"), or the Free German Trade Union Federation. In an attempt to include women in the political life in East Germany, there was even a Democratic Women's Federation of Germany with seats in the \"Volkskammer\".\n\nNon-parliamentary mass organizations which nevertheless played a key role in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (\"Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund\" or \"DTSB\") and People's Solidarity (\"Volkssolidarität\", an organisation for the elderly). Another society of note (and very popular during the late 1980s) was the Society for German-Soviet Friendship.\n\nOn 18 March 1990, the only free elections in the history of the GDR were held, producing a government whose major mandate was to negotiate an end to itself and its state.\n\nDesignated as an organ of the People's Chamber, the Council of State \"(Staatsrat der DDR)\" was largely a creation of Walter Ulbricht during his tenure as first secretary of the SED. After Ulbricht was forced to relinquish that position in 1971, the prestige and authority of the council correspondingly began to decline. However, although it was no longer the de facto supreme executive organ, Erich Honecker's assumption of the chairmanship of the Council of State in October 1976 represented a renewal of its importance. A similar move was made in the Soviet Union when Leonid Brezhnev became head of state. It is reasonable to assume that given East Germany's close adherence to Soviet practices, the increased invisibility of the Council of State since the late 1970s can be traced at least in part to parallel developments in the Soviet Union. Related to the takeover of the council's chairmanship by Honecker is the fact that after 1977 the number of individuals who were simultaneously members of the council and of the SED's Central Committee Secretariat increased.\n\nIn referring to the Council of State, the Constitution declared that it consisted of the chairman, deputy chairmen, members, and secretary; it did not specify the number of deputy chairmen and members. In 1987, under the chairmanship of Honecker, there were eight deputy chairmen and seventeen members. In addition to Honecker, two of the deputy chairmen, Horst Sindermann and Willi Stoph, were members of the \"Politbüro\" of the SED; Stoph was also chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Sindermann was president of the People's Chamber. Four of the deputy chairmen of the Council of State represented the other four political parties, as did four of its seventeen members. The day-to-day functions of the council were carried on by a staff consisting in 1987 of twenty offices and departments, all of which were headed by SED members. Despite the presence of non-SED members as deputy chairmen and members of the leadership group, SED control was guaranteed by the presence of Honecker, Stoph, Sindermann, and Egon Krenz, probably the four most powerful individuals in the country.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the functions performed by the Council of State included representing the country abroad and ratifying and terminating international treaties; supporting local assemblies in the implementation of their economic and budgetary plans; administering electoral laws that govern the selection of local assemblies on the community, city, county, and district levels; discharging responsibilities for the maintenance of the country's defense with the assistance of the National Defense Council; and administering the activities of the Supreme Court and the Office of the Prosecutor General to ensure their actions were congruent with the Constitution and the civil law. In this area, the Council of State possessed additional responsibility for proclaiming amnesties and pardons.\n\nThe Council of Ministers \"(Ministerrat der DDR)\" was the government of East Germany and the highest organ of the state apparatus. Its position in the system of government and its functions and tasks were specified in the Constitution as amended in 1974 as well as in the \"Law on the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic\" of October 1972. Whereas earlier the Council of Ministers had been described as the \"executive organ of the People's Chamber,\" the 1972 statute defined the council as the \"government.\" According to the new law, the Council of Ministers was to \"carry out the decisions of the party of the working class on the basis of the laws and decisions of the People's Chamber.\" The Constitution (as amended in 1974) significantly expanded the functions of the Council of Ministers at the expense of the Council of State.\n\nIn 1987 the Council of Ministers consisted of a chairman, two first deputy chairmen, and nine deputy chairmen, all of whom constituted an inner circle called the Presidium of the Council of Ministers. The chairman of the Council of Ministers, Willi Stoph, was head of the government (prime minister). Stoph, a representative of the old guard and a \"Politbüro\" member since 1953, was again appointed council chairman in 1986. Unlike the nine deputy chairmen, the two first deputy chairmen, \"Politbüro\" members Werner Krolikowski and Alfred Neumann, generally had not been responsible for specific ministerial portfolios.\n\nIn 1987 four of the nine deputy chairmen represented the four non-SED political parties allowed to operate in East Germany. The four non-SED deputy chairmen were the minister of posts and telecommunications - Rudolf Schulze of the CDU; the minister of environmental protection and water management - Hans Reichelt of the DBD; the minister of justice - Hans-Joachim Heusinger of the LDPD; and the chairman of the State Contract Court - Manfred Flegel of the NDPD. The other five positions held by deputy chairman on the Presidium of the Council of Ministers were occupied by members of the Central Committee of the SED. Two of the appointees, Günther Kleiber and Gerhard Schürer, a candidate member, were also \"Politbüro\" members. Of the thirty-three regular members on the council, including both ministers and nonministers, nineteen were concurrently members of the Central Committee of the SED, and two were also \"Politbüro\" members. The latter were Erich Mielke, minister of state security, and Hans Joachim Böhme, minister of university and technical affairs.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, all members of the Council of Ministers were formally elected to their posts by the People's Chamber for a five-year term. In fact, these decisions probably emanated from the \"Politbüro\" and the Central Committee of the SED. The Council of Ministers was required to work closely with the People's Chamber, and according to its administrative guidelines, the council was required to have all its legal drafts and decisions approved by the People's Chamber before they became law. In practice, the converse was true; the People's Chamber was obliged to approve those actions that were undertaken by the council and then routinely submitted to the legislature. Similarly, the People's Chamber was given the formal responsibility of selecting the membership of the council; in practice such personnel decisions were made by the \"Politbüro\". The legislature was then expected to approve the selections.\n\nThe Council of Ministers was responsible for providing the People's Chamber with the major legal drafts and decisions that subsequently were to be promulgated by the parliament. The work style of the Council of Ministers was a collective one. It normally met on a weekly basis to discuss problems and plans put forward by individual ministers. It also confirmed decisions that were already made by the Presidium. The Presidium was of special importance because of its responsibility for handling the affairs of the council when the full body was not in session.\n\nSpecific functional responsibilities of the Council of Ministers included directing and planning the national economy; solving problems growing out of membership in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon—see Appendix B); coordinating and implementing social policy decisions that have been agreed upon with the support and concurrence of the Free German Trade Union Federation \"(Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\"—FDGB); instructing and controlling subordinate levels of government, i.e., the councils at district, county, and community levels that implemented the laws and decisions of the central government; improving the functioning of the system of \"democratic centralism\" within the state apparatus; and carrying out the basic foreign policy principles of the socialist state.\n\nLike all other aspects of the government administration of East Germany, the party was the ultimate decision maker in the operation of the legal system. The Constitution, however, provided for the right of citizens to a voice in the judicial process and the selection of judges, directly or through their elected representatives. It further provided for citizen participation in the administration of justice in an effort to deter crime. Basic guarantees for justice were said to derive from the \"socialist society, the political power of the working people, and their state and legal system.\"\n\nIn fact, separation of powers did not exist in the East German system of government. Although the Constitution asserted the independence of the courts, it also subordinated the judiciary to the political authorities and their political goals. Even the superficially democratic 1949 Constitution subordinated the judiciary, along with all other government organs, to the People's Chamber. Judgeships were restricted to Communists of proven loyalty. The regime officially considered law and justice the tools for building a communist society and declared it the duty of all judicial and legal officers to serve this end. In effect, legal and judicial organs served as agencies for promoting official doctrine, and the careers of personnel in the system were dependent on their political ratings as determined by higher state and party officials.\n\nAt the top of East Germany's legal system was the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Office of the Prosecutor General. In 1987 the heads of these offices were, respectively, Hans-Joachim Heusinger (LDPD), Heinrich Toeplitz (CDU), and Josef Streit (SED). The Prosecutor General appointed prosecutors throughout East Germany, including those active in military courts; he could dismiss them, and they were \"responsible to him and bound by his instructions.\" The Office of the Prosecutor General was also responsible for supervising \"strict adherence to socialist legality and protecting citizens from violations of the law.\" The role of the Ministry of Justice, which was not mentioned in the Constitution, appeared to be largely formal and propagandistic.\n\nThe organs of justice were the Supreme Court, regional courts, district courts, and social courts. Military jurisdiction was exercised by the Supreme Court and military tribunals and courts. The specific areas of responsibility for each level of the court system are defined by law. Professional and lay judges of the courts are elected for five years by corresponding representative bodies, except district court judges, who were elected directly by the citizenry. They were subject to dismissal for malfeasance and for violations of law and the Constitution in the performance of their duties.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Supreme Court, as the highest organ of the legal system, directed the jurisdiction of all lower courts and was charged with ensuring the uniform application of the law on all levels. The highest court not only had the right of extraordinary appeal as a measure of control over the lower courts but on occasion serves as a link in the chain of command by issuing general legal directives. According to Article 93 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court \"directs the jurisdiction of the courts on the basis of the Constitution, the laws, and their statutory regulations. . . . It ensures a uniform application of the law by all courts.\" The directive function of the Supreme Court went far beyond that of supreme courts in Western systems, which as a rule do not give legally binding instructions to the lower courts concerning specific questions of law. The Supreme Court was responsible to the People's Chamber and, between the latter's sessions, to the Council of State. Internally, the organization of the high court consisted of an assembly, a presidium, and three functional administrative divisions known as collegiums for criminal justice, military justice, and civil, family, and labor law. The assembly, which was directed in its plenary sessions by the Supreme Court Presidium, consisted of fifteen directors of the district courts, the chairmen of the higher military courts, and all professional judges.\n\nEach district court was presided over by a professional judge and two jurors in cases of original jurisdiction and by three professional judges in cases of appellate jurisdiction. The district courts had appellate jurisdiction in civil cases and original jurisdiction in major criminal cases such as economic crimes, murder, and crimes against the state.\n\nThe county court was the lowest level of the judiciary system, and each of the country's counties had at least one such court, which was presided over by a professional judge and two lay assessors. The majority of all criminal and civil cases were tried at this level; county courts had jurisdiction over cases not assigned elsewhere and civil cases involving only small amounts of property.\n\nIn addition to the regular law courts, East Germany also developed an extensive system of community and social courts \"(gesellschaftliche Gerichte)\", known also as \"conflict or arbitration commissions\" \"(Konflikt-und Schiedskommissionen)\". The first were formed in state-owned and private enterprises, health and educational institutions, offices, and social organizations. The second were established in residential areas, collective farms, and cooperatives of manual laborers, fishermen, and gardeners. Created to relieve the regular courts of their minor civil or criminal case loads, the jurisdiction of the courts applied to labor disputes, minor breaches of the peace, misdemeanors, infringements of the law, truancy, and conflicts in civil law. These courts were composed of lay jurors elected by their respective constituencies. Party officials at the community level generally influenced the nomination of jurors to the community courts and exercised considerable influence on the outcome of cases heard at this level.\n\nLeaders and their key positions - \"see also Leaders of East Germany\"\n\nOthers\n\n\n\n"}

Roche was affiliated with Group of 184 and an opponent of Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his Fanmi Lavalas political party and pro-Lavalas were suspected of carrying out his murder.\n\nJacques Roche was born July 21st, 1961 . His family was from Cavaellon and according to Father Gérard Jean-Juste, Roche's mother once saved his life.\n\nRoche led the organization Assemblée des Peuples de la Caraïbe au Cap Haïtien. Roche was known to organize photography exhibitions to educate different communities throughout Haiti. He also encouraged the public's resistance to laws being passed in Haiti, such as the Haiti's Zona Franca, a law which replaced some of the last fertile land in Haiti with sweatshops.\n\nJacques Roche was a journalist and editor of the \"Le Matin\" daily arts and culture newspaper section. He also hosted a local television show. The television show he was a host for focused on civil society issues for Group of 184. Roche was also a poet.\n\nJacques Roche was kidnapped on July 10, 2005. Roche was driving in the downtown area of Nazon in Port-au-Prince where he would participate in a civil rights rally. Roche was kidnapped by a group of three or four people and then handed over the a gang who then demanded a ransom.\n\nThe kidnappers of Roche demanded a $250,000 ransom for his safe return, but his family and friends could only come up with $10,000, therefore he was killed. His family suspect that his affiliation with the Group of 184 ultimately led to his kidnapping and execution. Group of 184 is an anti-Aristide group that protests against the civil rights that they have in Haiti.\n\nDays later in the afternoon of July 14, 2005, Roche's tortured body was found in the downtown area of Port-au-Prince. Television footage showed him tied to a chair and mutilated. Police say he was tortured, both of Roche's arms were broken, his tongue had been cut out. His actual cause of death was ruled as gun shots to the mouth.\n\nVarious charges were made about which group was involved in Roche's kidnapping and directed against the government and a priest. Political opposition leader Father Gérard Jean-Juste, a priest who attended Roche's funeral and was attacked and beaten by mourners, was also accused and detained for questioning, although he was in Florida at the time of Roche's murder and he knew Roche's family. Those charges were later dropped following international protest and claims of political motivation by government police and judges.\n\nOn July 16 and 22, 2005, members of the UN mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and local police arrested three suspects. According to Reporters Without Borders, the suspects belonged to a gang called the \"Rat Army\" that operated in the Port-au-Prince district of Bel-Air. Two people were later sentenced to life in prison for the death of Roche.\n\nJacques Roche is just one of many journalists in Haiti who had been threatened due to his affiliation with the news and media of Haiti. It is believed that journalists all throughout Haiti have been targeted, threatened and attacked because of the lawlessness in Haiti. Some journalists have taken to extreme measures and fled the country because of this. Nancy Roc, who was a host for a radio show in Haiti called Radio Metropole, fled the country after she was threatened and warned of being abducted.\n\nRoche's death is believed to be the beginning of a long string of kidnappings and killings within Haiti. These murders target people who are activists of civil rights in the country. The only way for these killings to stop is for there be an agreement on the rights of the Haitian citizens. Over the last year, Port-au-Prince, Haiti has been the target of hundreds of kidnappings and killings. More than 700 people have been killed in the past 10 months, 40 of those people being law enforcement officials.\n\nAfter Jacques Roche's kidnapping, murder and finding of his body, civil society organizations showed support by stating how much of an impact Roche's contributions as an activist had on the community. These organizations called for everyone to come together and honor Jacques Roche by continuing to protest the terrible living conditions that their community has had for many years.\n\nAfter Roche's death, international groups spoke out about his death.\n\nKoïchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, said, \"I condemn the abduction and murder of Jacques Roche. He is a victim of the violence that continues to plague the Haitian capital. His murder was not directly linked to his professional activities, but the press is one of the sectors most at risk in this climate of terror. Journalists in Haiti have been threatened and attacked, and are forced to limit their movements due to the pervasive lawlessness. A free and independent press, which is an essential component of a democratic society, cannot exist in such conditions. I trust that the government of Haiti will play its part in restoring order and the rule of law.\"\n\nActionAID, which is a group in South Africa issued a statement saying \"We fervently denouncing Jacques Roche's cowardly execution. We firmly state our outrage on all the attacks on all journalists and citizens.\" This organization is also known for working together to come to an end of human suffering.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2238559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238559", "title": "Mathematical Tripos", "text": "Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe Mathematical Tripos is the mathematics course that is taught in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. It is the oldest Tripos examined at the University.\n\nIn its classical nineteenth-century form, the tripos was a distinctive written examination of undergraduate students of the University of Cambridge. Prior to 1824, the Mathematical Tripos was formally known as the \"Senate House Examination\". From about 1780 to 1909, the \"Old Tripos\" was distinguished by a number of features, including the publication of an order of merit of successful candidates, and the difficulty of the mathematical problems set for solution. By way of example, in 1854, the Tripos consisted of 16 papers spread over 8 days, totaling 44.5 hours. The total number of questions was 211. The actual marks for the exams were never published, but there is reference to an exam in the 1860s where, out of a total possible mark of 17,000, the senior wrangler achieved 7634, the second wrangler 4123, the lowest wrangler around 1500 and the lowest scoring candidate obtaining honours (the wooden spoon) 237; about 100 candidates were awarded honours. The 300-odd candidates below that level did not earn honours and were known as \"poll men\". The questions for the 1841 examination may be found within the Cambridge University Magazine (pages 191-208).\nAccording to the study \"Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics\" by Andrew Warwick during this period the style of teaching and study required for the successful preparation of students had a wide influence:\n\nSince Cambridge students did a lot of rote learning called \"bookwork\", it was noted by Augustus De Morgan and repeated by Andrew Warwick that authors of Cambridge textbooks skipped known material. In consequence, \"non-Cambridge readers ... found the arguments impossible to follow.\"\n\nThe early history is of the gradual replacement during the middle of the eighteenth century of a traditional method of oral examination by written papers, with a simultaneous switch in emphasis from Latin disputation to mathematical questions. That is, all degree candidates were expected to show at least competence in mathematics. A long process of development of coaching—tuition usually outside the official University and college courses—went hand-in-hand with a gradual increase in the difficulty of the most testing questions asked. The standard examination pattern of \"bookwork\" (mostly memorised theorems) plus \"rider\" (problems to solve, testing comprehension of the bookwork) was introduced.\n\nThe list of wranglers (the candidates awarded a first-class degree) became in time the subject of a great deal of public attention. \nAccording to Alexander Macfarlane\nWilliam Hopkins was the first coach distinguished by his students' performances. When he retired in 1849, one of his students, Edward Routh became the dominant coach. Another coach, William Henry Besant published a textbook, \"Elementary Hydrostatics\", containing mathematical exercises and solutions such as would benefit students preparing for Tripos. After Routh retired in 1888, Robert Rumsey Webb coached many of the top wranglers. Warwick notes that college teaching improved toward the end of the 19th century:\nA fellow of Trinity College, Robert Alfred Herman then was associated with several of the top wranglers as their coach; evidently the University was finally providing their students with education.\n\nWhen A. R. Forsyth wrote his retrospective in 1935, he recalled Webb, Percival Frost, Herman, and Besant as the best coaches. Other coaches that produced top wranglers include E. W. Hobson, John Hilton Grace, H. F. Baker, Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich, and A. E. H. Love.\n\nApart from intellectual preparation, the challenge of Tripos was its duration: \"The examinations themselves were intended partly as tests of endurance, taking place on consecutive mornings and afternoons for four and five days together.\" Brisk walking was taken up by many candidates to build up their stamina. As the nineteenth century progressed walking turned to athletics and other competitive sports including rowing and swimming. The coaches set the example: Routh had a two-hour constitutional walk daily, while \"Besant was a mountaineer, Webb a walker, and Frost was extremely proficient in cricket, tennis, running and swimming.\" By 1900 there were twenty-three recognized sports contested at Cambridge.\n\nIn 1880 Charlotte Angas Scott of Britain obtained special permission to take the Tripos, as women were not normally allowed to sit for the exam. She came eighth on the Tripos of all students taking them, but due to her sex, the title of \"eighth wrangler,\" a high honour, went officially to a male student. At the ceremony, however, after the seventh wrangler had been announced, all the students in the audience shouted her name. Because she could not attend the award ceremony, Scott celebrated her accomplishment at Girton College where there were cheers and clapping at dinner, a special evening ceremony where the students sang \"See the Conquering Hero Comes\", received an ode written by a staff member, and was crowned with laurels. After this incident women were allowed to formally take the exam and their exam scores listed, although separately from the men's and thus not included in the rankings. Women obtaining the necessary score also received a special certificate instead of the BA degree with honours.\n\nIn 1890 British woman Philippa Fawcett became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Tripos.\n\nReforms were implemented in 1909. The undergraduate course of mathematics at Cambridge still reflects a historically-broad approach; and problem-solving skills are tested in examinations, though the setting of excessively taxing questions has been discouraged for many years.\n\n the Mathematical Tripos course comprises three undergraduate years (Parts IA, IB and II) which qualify a student for a BA degree, and an optional one year masters course (Part III) which qualifies a student for a Master of Mathematics (MMath) degree (with BA) if they\nare a Cambridge fourth year student or a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) degree\nif they come from outside just to do Part III. \nAssessment is mostly by written examination at the end of each academic year, with some coursework elements in the second, third and fourth years.\n\nDuring the undergraduate part of the course, students are expected to attend around 12 one-hour lectures per week on average, together with two supervisions. Supervisions are informal sessions in which a small group of students—normally a pair—goes through previously completed example sheets under the guidance of a faculty member, college fellow or graduate student.\n\nDuring the first year, Part IA, the schedule of courses is quite rigid, providing much of the basic knowledge requisite for mathematics, including algebra, analysis, methods in calculus, and probability. The second year, Part IB, contains no mandatory content but it is recommended that students do particular courses as they are an essential prerequisites for further courses. A range of pure courses, such as geometry, complex analysis and a course studying group theory, rings and modules are on offer as well as applied courses on electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics. In Part II, students are free to choose from a large number of courses over a wide range of mathematical topics, these are separated into more accessible C courses and D courses with are more involved. Some students choose to exchange 25% of the first year mathematics options in exchange for the Physics option of first year Natural Sciences Tripos with the possibility of changing to Natural Sciences at the end of the first year.\n\n\nThe Tripos was an important institution in nineteenth century England and many notable figures were involved with it. It has attracted broad attention from scholars. See for example:\n\nIn old age two undergraduates of the 1870s wrote sharply contrasting accounts of the Old Tripos — one negative, one positive. Andrew Forsyth, Senior Wrangler 1881, stayed in Cambridge and was one of the reformers responsible for the New Tripos. Karl Pearson Third Wrangler in 1879 made his career outside Cambridge.\n\nJ. J. Thomson, a Second Wrangler in 1880, wrote about his experience in: \n\nJ. E. Littlewood, a Senior Wrangler in the last years of the old Tripos, recalled the experience in:\n\nOn the importance of the Tripos in the history of mathematics in Britain: search on \"tripos\" in\n\nFor statistics on the number of graduates (men and women) between 1882 and 1940 see:\n\nFor the present-day Tripos see:\n"}

Lying on the River Irwell, it is around north of Ramsbottom, south of Rawtenstall, and west of Norden, and has a total population of 2,080, reducing to 2,053 at the 2011 Census.\n\nEdenfield village centre lies at the intersection of three A roads; the A676 from Bolton, the A680 from Accrington and Rochdale and the A56 from Rawtenstall and Bury. The M66 motorway terminates its course at Edenfield, whereupon it becomes the A56 dual carriageway known as the Edenfield Bypass.\n\nThe village has recently seen growth as a commuter settlement for Greater Manchester.\n\nThe origins of the Edenfield place name are not entirely clear, but it seems extremely unlikely that it derives from \"fields of Eden\" or similar. Given the large number of Norse-derived place names in Rossendale and bearing in mind that documents from the 17th century and older spell the name as Aydenfield or some variant of this, a likely etymology is the Norse \"øy\" (riverside ground/island; see for instance the village of Øyer) + \"tun\" (farmstead) + field; in other words, the land belonging to the farmstead by the river (Irwell).\n\nEdenfield Chapel of Ease (the precursor of the parish church and part of the benefice of Bury) is extensively mentioned in 16th-century documents.\nIt probably had its own curate before the Reformation.\nA deed of 1564 mentions one Ralph Nuttall making payments to Richard Nuttall for a land settlement \nand that these payments were to take place \"in Edenfield Chapel\".\nA century later there were \"aboute foure and twenty tenements and \nhouses w th in Shuttleworth in the Lordshippe of Burghe [Bury], \nbeinge all the houses w th in Shuttleworth afforesaid who are \nappointed by the said Orders to' pay theire tyths to Bury, \nwho are much nearer to the Chapel of Aydenfield [Edenfield] \nafforesaid, and vsually repaire thither to the ordinances when \nthey have a mister\".\n\nLike other villages in Rossendale, Edenfield later became involved in industry and some quarrying activities still continue.\n\nBritain's largest onshore wind farm was controversially built in 2007–08 on Scout Moor above Edenfield.\n\nSince 1974, Edenfield has formed part of the Rossendale borough of Lancashire, having previously formed part of the urban district of Ramsbottom, in the administrative county boundaries of Lancashire.\n\nEdenfield is part of the Rossendale and Darwen Parliamentary Constituency, with the current MP being Jake Berry.\n\nEdenfield lies above the east bank of the River Irwell, within the Rossendale valley. The landscape of the area is dominated by Dearden Moor and Scout Moor directly to the east and Holcombe Moor with the Peel Monument, across the valley of the River Irwell to the west. The M66 motorway terminates its course at Edenfield.\n\nThe main thoroughfare in the village is Market Street, along which occurs mostly late 19th century terraced housing and a number of shops.\n\nThe number and type of shops in the village has varied over recent years, with an overall decline due to the increased mobility of the population and competition from nearby supermarkets, but mainstays have been an independent baker (Sixsmith's), butcher, pharmacy, post office, newsagent and fish and chip shop.\n\nA number of mills sprang up during the industrial revolution from the 1760s onwards - not without the usual Luddite unrest. A once-famous 19th century novel refers to a character \"who crossed the hills to preach at Edenfield on Sunday [saying] that machines were broken on Saturday\". The mills, built particularly alongside Dearden Brook which provided the water power, are now closed but some remains can be seen in Dearden Clough.\n\nThat the main route north from Manchester runs through the village explains the many coaching houses, of which only three public houses survive - \"the Rostron Arms\", \"the Horse and Jockey\" and \"the Coach\". During the second half of the 19th century Edenfield had its own brewery, the products of which were not entirely popular: due to their purgative effect the ale was known as \"Sh-t-n Br-ches\". An article published in 1983 described a ghostly headless horseman who allegedly haunts the main road but this \"legend\" is not widely known elsewhere.\n\nThe parish church is a simple but elegant 18th century building unusual in that it takes its name from the village rather than being dedicated to a particular saint. Despite some 19th century additions it was famously described in John Betjeman's book as \"unspoiled, unspruced Georgian\". There is a 1970s photograph of the church, showing part of the main street, village school and the now-demolished Chapel House Farm, on the website of Edenfield-born musician Dr Tim Rishton (who was organist there as a child). The former Wesleyan chapel on the junction between Market Street and Rochdale Road was demolished in 1960, but there is still an imposing Primitive Methodist church, built in 1881 at the junction of Bond Street and Rochdale Road.\n\nThe area is popular with walkers and hikers, many stopping to see , a hillside memorial to the Lancashire Dialect writer and poet Edwin Waugh.\n\nAnother popular walk is Dearden Clough to 'Plunge' - the ruined site of \"Plunge Mill\", where there is an imposing pit wheel housing for a waterwheel. One approach to the clough is from \"Michael Wife Lane\", named after Mary Nuttall, wife of Michael Nuttall, who was fined in 1618 for not maintaining the road and, finally, put in the stocks in 1624 for still not carrying out this work.\n\nThe village is home to Edenfield Cricket Club. There is also a recreation ground on Exchange Street which is used by a number of football teams of varying ages. Alongside is Edenfield Community Centre serving a number of uses for different interest groups.\n\nIn May 2010 more than 270 sheep, worth a total of £17,000, were stolen from fields behind the \"Horse and Jockey\" public house.\n\nIn May 2011, Edenfield was again in the news due to a protest regarding the proposed accommodation of sex offenders at Chatterton Hey House.\n\n\n"}

GoodNites are pull-up style rather than diaper-style to make it easier for children experiencing nocturnal enuresis to change their bedwetting diapers on their own.\n\nGoodNites serves as the middle level of incontinence products in Kimberly-Clark's line. Huggies diapers are marketed for babies. Pull-Ups training pants are marketed for toddlers. Depend undergarments are marketed to older adults.\n\nPrior to 2004, GoodNites were unisex, plain-white diapers with only a faux tag printed on the back.\n\nThe original GoodNites were released in 1994. They came in two sizes: medium (45-65 lbs) and large (65-85 lbs). In 1999, Kimberly-Clark introduced a new extra-large size (85 lbs-125 lbs and up). \n\nIn 2001, a \"Cloth-Like Cover\" replaced the previous cover. In 2003, Kimberly-Clark introduced the \"Trim-Fit\" style (a drastic reduction in padding thickness and the overall size of the diapers). In 2004, Kimberly-Clark introduced gender-specific GoodNites with absorbency zoned for boys and girls. Medium GoodNites became small/medium and were designed to fit kids 38-65 pounds. Large and extra large GoodNites were combined into large/extra-Large for kids from 60-125+ pounds (Height for healthy weight of 125 pounds is 4' 11\" up to 5' 8\" (The CDC states that the Average Height for Men is 69in or 5' 9\" with an average waist size of 40.3in while the Average for Women is 63.6in or 5' 3.6\" with the average waist size of 38.7in)). The small/medium size is the equivalent of size 4-8 underwear (Size 8 US is 23.5in Waist). The large/extra-large size is equivalent to size 8-14 underwear (Size 14 US is 27in Waist). \n\nIn 2017, a new extra-small size was introduced for both boys and girls. It fits clothing sizes 3-5 and is designed for children weighing 28-45 lbs.\n\nIn 2019, GoodNites has updated the logo online and is stating \"New Look, Coming Soon The same protection you trust, with brand new packaging!\"\n\nIn a study published in the Bulletin of Pediatric Health, GoodNites and similar bedwetting underpants were analyzed for effectiveness in relieving social anxiety related to bedwetting for boys ages 7 to 13 and for girls ages 5 to 15. Nearly five-hundred boys who wore bedwetting underpants on a nightly-basis were compared to a control group experiencing the same problem but did not wear bedwetting underpants to bed. 625 girls who wore bedwetting underpants on a nightly-basis were compared to a control group experiencing the same problem but did not wear bedwetting underpants to bed. The study found, predictably, that nearly all of the children were fearful of being discovered to be \"diaper-wearers\" by their peers, while forty-eight percent of the 7-to-10-year-olds and eighty-one percent of the 11-to-13-year-olds described Goodnites, in particular, being \"a little\" or \"very babyish.\" Despite these statistics, sixty percent said they would not go to bed without them. Asked about what they feared upon \"discovery,\" the top worries were verbal teasing (89%) and loss of friends (61%) followed closely by physical bullying (gaining bullies, being beaten up by a peer, given wedgies, swirlies, or other kinds of playground bullying) 57%, and being compared to a baby (51%). Actual incidences of bullying due to bedwetting were found to be higher among the diaper-wearers than in the control, leading the study's author to conclude that the GoodNites and similar products did successfully add to the wearers' confidence, so that they engaged more in what was dubbed for the purposes of the study \"risky behavior\" (e.g. going to sleepovers, participation in camping trips); 17% of the experimental group reported bullying, while only 11% of the control reported bullying.\n\nGoodNites Boxers (for boys) and Sleep Shorts (for girls) were a product manufactured by Kimberly-Clark from 2007–2009, and distributed from 2007–2010. They were designed to look and feel like boxers. They were blue for boys and pink for girls. The outer covering was cloth-like to look like a pair of boxers. The inside was a white, plastic diaper.\n\nAs of 2011, Kimberly-Clark makes no reference to this product line on the official GoodNites website.\n\nGoodNites released GoodNites Bed Mats in April 2012. They can be used to protect the mattress from bedwetting accidents. GoodNites Bed Mats feature adhesive to allow them to stick to the bed.\n\nWhen they were first released, GoodNites were an alternative to waterproof mattress pads and more expensive disposable youth diapers intended for the disabled; as a result, they lacked any direct competition. By 2000, GoodNites' primary competition consisted of store brand disposable bedwetting diapers. In 2002, Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark's primary competitor, introduced Luvs Sleepdrys as a direct competitor to GoodNites. Luvs Sleepdrys were discontinued in 2004, and, from 2004 to 2008, store brands were the primary form of direct competition to GoodNites. In 2008, Procter & Gamble released Pampers Underjams as another direct competitor to GoodNites. Currently, GoodNites' competition comes from both Pampers Underjams and store brand bedwetting diapers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2238588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238588", "title": "Damaskinos of Athens", "text": "Damaskinos of Athens\n\nArchbishop Damaskinos Papandreou (3 March 1891 – 20 May 1949) was the archbishop of Athens and All Greece from 1941 until his death. He was also the regent of Greece between the pull-out of the German occupation force in 1944 and the return of King George II to Greece in 1946. His rule was between the liberation of Greece from the German occupation during World War II and the Greek Civil War.\n\nHe was born Dimitrios Papandreou (no relation to the Papandreou political family from Achaea) in Dorvitsa, Greece. He enlisted in the Greek army during the Balkan Wars. He was ordained a priest of the Greek Orthodox Church in 1917. In 1922, he was made Bishop of Corinth. He spent the early 1930s as an ambassador of the Ecumenical Patriarch in the United States, where he labored to help organize the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.\n\nIn 1938 he was elected Archbishop of Athens, taking the name Damaskinos. Ioannis Metaxas, dictator of Greece at the time, objected to Damaskinos and forced the cancellation of his election, and the appointment of Metropolitan Chrysanthus to the post. After the 1941 German invasion of Greece and the fall of the Greek government, the Metropolitans who had elected Damaskinos seized the opportunity to eject Chrysanthus from the throne (with German agreement, as the latter had refused to be present at the oath-taking ceremony of the quisling Prime Minister Georgios Tsolakoglu), and Damaskinos was reinstalled.\n\nThe Archbishop of Athens was the spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox people of Athens and All Greece, and Damaskinos worked very hard to live up to his position during those hard times. He frequently clashed with the German authorities and the quisling government. The Germans took Greeks hostage and threatened to execute their hostages in the event of resistance. Damaskinos often visited hostages in prison the night before their executions to offer spiritual comfort to the doomed. The archbishop frequently sent his lawyer, Iannis Yeorgakis, to argue for free on behalf of Greeks tried in German military courts. In December 1942, Yeorgakis was banned from representing Greeks before the military courts after he had supposedly insulted a military judge. Initially, Yeorgakis accompanied those convicted by the military courts to their executions to offer moral support, but he found this duty to be so hollowing and heart-breaking that he ceased. \n\nIn 1943, the Germans began the extermination of the Jews of Greece, and their deportations to Nazi concentration camps. Damaskinos formally protested the actions of the occupational authorities. \n\nDamaskinos first spoke out of behalf of the Jews in March 1943 when he published public letters addressed to Prime Minister Konstantinos Logothetopoulos of the Hellenic State and Günther Altenburg of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", which together with the Wehrmacht administered Greece. Using his moral authority as archbishop of Athens, Damaskinos also had 19 distinguished Greeks from the arts, the law, academia and business worlds co-signed his letter. Referring to the deportation of the Jews of Thessaloniki to the Auschwitz death camp which already began earlier in March 1943, Damaskinos wrote he and others in the Orthodox faith followed the words of St. Paul that \"there is neither Jew nor Greek\". Altenburg in his reply to the archbishop denied that the Jews of Thessaloniki (which was one of the largest Jewish communities in the Balkans) were being exterminated when they arrived in Poland, claiming that were merely being sent to Poland to work in factories while Logothetopoulos never replied. \n\nAccording to the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation, the appeal of Damaskinos and his fellow Greeks is unique as no document similar to the protest against the Nazis during World War II has come to light in any other European country.\n\nThe letter in part reads:\n\nDamaskinos went on to publish the letter, even though the local \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) commander, Jürgen Stroop, threatened to execute him by firing squad. Damaskinos's famous response to him was:\n\nThe Archbishop was being boldly sarcastic, as he was referring to the lynching and hanging of Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople by a Turkish mob in 1821, the point being made that the SS commander would act in a similarly barbaric fashion if he were to carry out his threat.\nThe churches under his jurisdiction were also ordered quietly by Damaskinos to distribute Christian baptismal certificates to Jews fleeing the Nazis, thus saving thousands of Romaniote Jews in and around Athens. Damaskinos advised his priests to do everything they could to help the Jews and to hide those for whom it was not possible to forge baptismal certificates. For his actions in saving Greek Jews during the Holocaust, he was named among the Righteous Among the Nations distinction by Yad Vashem.\n\nAfter the occupation ended, Damaskinos was proclaimed regent of Greece until a referendum to be held for the return or not of King George II from exile. Harold Macmillan, the junior British minister of charge of the Mediterranean met Damaskinos on 14 December 1944 and wrote his impression: \"I was impressed by the wide grasp of European politics, the good sense, humor, and courage of this ecclesiastic. He is willing to accept the regency, but realises the difficulties. He shares our view that there must be no reprisals and no counter-revolution\". The king was opposed to the idea of a regency and used his friendship with Winston Churchill turned the prime minister completely against Damaskinos, saying he was a both a Communist and a collaborator. Based on what he had heard from the king, Churchill called Damaskinos a \"pestilent priest, a survival from the Middle Ages\". During this time, fighting broke out between pro-royalist Greek soldiers and communist partisans in the \"Dekemvriana\" events. He took control of the situation in his early term, appointing himself Prime Minister during late 1945. Though he wielded little power in his latter term, Damaskinos continued to call for peace and order in the country. \n\nDuring the \"Dekemvriana\" fighting in Athens, Churchill visited the city and first met Damaskinos on Christmas Day 1944 aboard HMS \"Ajax\". After meeting him, Churchill completely changed his view of him, writing: \"It was impossible to doubt that Damaskinos greatly feared the Communists combination in Greek affairs...Generally he impressed me with a good deal of confidence\". On Boxing Day 1944, Churchill again met Damaskinos and wrote \"I was already convinced that he was the outstanding figure in the Greek turmoil\". The same day, Damaskinos chaired a conference aimed at a peaceful solution to the crisis, attended by members of both EAM and the government. At the conference, it was agreed that King George II would not return at once as he wanted, Damaskinos would continue as Regent, the prime minister Georgios Papandreou would resign in favor of General Nikolaos Plastiras and a ceasefire would be proclaimed to end the fighting. On 3 January 1945, Damaskinos swore in a new government headed by Plastiras, which was described as \"wholly republican and moderately left-wing\". \n\nOn 12 January 1945, a truce was signed ending the fighting and the ELAS forces were pulled out of Athens to a distance of 70 miles away from the capital. However, EAM refused to release its hostages it had taken, which led Damaskinos in a press statement to state: \"I deeply regret that during the negotiations for a truce it was not made possible to settle the question of the hostages\". A conference to settle the conflict, a conference at Varkiza opened on 2 February 1945, where it was agreed on 11 February after much difficult negotiations that EAM would release its hostages and disarm in exchange for amnesty, the end of martial law, and a promise to purge those Greeks who had collaborated with the Germans to be purged from the civil service. On 12 February 1945, the Treaty of Varkiza as the peace agreement was \ncalled was signed. On 14 February, Churchill visited Athens on his way home from the Yalta conference, and rode on an open car with Damaskinos through the streets of Athens being loudly cheered by 40, 000 Athenians. \n\nHe relinquished his position after fighting began to die down and recalled the king formally on September 28, 1946. On 5 July 1947, Damaskinos become a founding member of the Queen's Fund (\"Vasiliki Pronia\") charity founded by Queen Frederica to assist with the children left homeless by the Greek Civil War. He died in Athens in 1949.\n\n"}

He was also the founder of British independent Slave Trade. In latter 17th century London there was no official postal system for mail delivery within the city of London and its suburbs. Dockwra's London Penny Post was a mail delivery system that fulfilled this need. His system worked so well that it compromised the interests of private couriers and porters and royal officials alike.\n\nDockwra was born in the City of London, the son of an armourer, and died in 1716. His date of birth is uncertain; however, records show him to have been baptised in 1635. He was the uncle of Mary Davies, whose dowry of Mayfair and other lands near London would make the Grosvenor family the richest family in England by the 19th century, and this connection was to prove beneficial to Dockwra's own fortunes.\n\nDockwra was apprenticed to one of his father's fellows in the Armourers' Company, but his career subsequently took a variety of turns. In the 1660s he obtained a position at the Custom House. By the 1670s he was a merchant in the African slave trade, but he suffered major losses when a ship in which he had a large share was seized for breaching the Royal African Company's licensed monopoly, and in the 1680s he was involved in the development of Jersey in the United States, being appointed to the board of the \"East Jersey Board of Proprietors\" in 1683.\n\nOn 1 April 1680, Dockwra established the first penny post, which served London and the surrounding area to a distance of ten miles. The service worked on the basis that \"the one penny postage was paid when the letter was accepted\" (a key element of Rowland Hill's 1839 reforms of the British postal system). Dockwra obtained a patent for his service, but unfortunately for him the profits from the government-operated General Post Office had been granted to the King's brother the Duke of York. Dockwra was required to surrender his patent and pay £2,000 in compensation. His fortunes improved after the Duke, by then King James II, was expelled from the country in 1688. In 1690 Dockwra was granted a pension of £500 a year; then in 1697 he was appointed as comptroller of the penny post. However, in 1700 he was dismissed after an investigation into his conduct of the business, including complaints that he had moved the central office from Cornhill to a less convenient location and had opened and detained correspondence.\n\nDockwra was appointed as the London agent for the sale of lead from the Grosvenor family's lead mines in Wales, and had become the senior partner in a brass smelting business based in Esher. This project introduced some technical innovations and helped to reduce England's dependence on imports, but it was not a financial success for Dockwra, who lost control of the business. He is believed to have been poor at his death.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nearby are the hamlets of Chatterton and Strongstry.\n\nIt is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, with Jake Berry having been the Member of Parliament since 2010.\n\nMuch of the land to the west of the village is in the care of the National Trust and consists of hillside pasture and woodland leading up to Holcombe Moor and Peel Tower.\n\nThe adjoining parkland (at Chatterton) was given to the people of the district of Ramsbottom as a peace memorial by the Porritt family. The village public house (now private offices - redeveloped in 2006), the Corner Pin, was originally the Railway Hotel, recalling the days when the village was still served by Stubbins railway station. This branch of the line is still used by the East Lancashire Railway to run regular weekend steam services between Rawtenstall and Bury. The second line now provides an attractive walk to Irwell Vale. Col. A.T. Porritt gave much of the nearby countryside to the National Trust in memory of his son, Richard, who was killed in the Second World War.\n\nStubbins has a long history; its name (see below) looks back to the Middle Ages when people were carving new farms out of the heavily wooded countryside. Like other communities in Rossendale, Stubbins grew in the Industrial Revolution. The change to an industrial village began towards the end of the 18th century when a calico printworks was built on the site now occupied by Georgia-Pacific.\n\nThe 19th century owners of the printworks began to give the village its present shape by building rows of terraced houses for their workers. The other main employers were the Porritt family who built Stubbins Vale Mill in 1851 and the Ramsbottom Spinning and Manufacturing Co., a co-operative of working men, whose 1861 factory was christened Union Mill.

By 1750, all that remained was a pool of water, which was drained on the order of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. Gardens were then built in the area, but these were removed by the Vienna city council, then under the \"Red Vienna\" period of control by the Social Democratic Party of Austria, to make room for the erection of Karl-Marx-Hof, financed by a special tax named after councillor Hugo Breitner, commissioning locally and internationally renowned architects.\n\nKarl-Marx-Hof was built between 1927 and 1930 by city planner Karl Ehn, a follower of Otto Wagner. It held 1,382 apartments (with a size of 30–60 m² each). Only 18.5% of the 156,000 m²-large area was built up, with the rest of the area developed into play areas and gardens. Designed for a population of about 5,000, the premises include many amenities, including laundromats, baths, kindergartens, a library, doctor offices, and business offices.\n\nKarl-Marx-Hof was well known during the \"February Uprising\" () of the 1934 Austrian Civil War (). Those insurgents engaged in the revolt barricaded themselves inside the building and were forced to surrender after the Austrian army, the police, and the Austrofascist paramilitary Heimwehr bombarded the site regardless of the unarmed dwellers, mainly worker families, with light artillery. During the Anschluss, Karl-Marx-Hof was renamed \"Heiligenstädter Hof\", but took its original name back in 1945.\n\nThe heavy artillery damage to Karl-Marx-Hof was repaired in the 1950s. It has been used as a filming location for some movies, most notably \"The Night Porter\". The building was refurbished between 1989 and 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

They are semi-parasitic on grasses and other plants. The common name refers to the plant's use in treating eye infections.\n\nMany species are found in alpine or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are zygomorphic, and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.\n\nAlternative names, mainly in herbalism, are \"Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae\" and \"Herbe d'Euphraise\".\n\nThe plant was known to classical herbalists, but then was not referred to until mentioned again in 1305. Nicholas Culpeper assigned it to the Zodiac sign Leo, claiming that it strengthened the brain. It was also used to treat bad memory and vertigo.\n\nIn the Elizabethan era the plant was used in ales and Gervase Markham's \"Countrie Farm\" (1616) recommended that one should \"Drinke everie morning a small draught of Eyebright wine.\"\n\nHerbalists use eyebright as a poultice with or without concurrent administration of a tea for the redness, swelling, and visual disturbances caused by blepharitis and conjunctivitis. The herb is also used for eyestrain and to relieve inflammation caused by colds, coughs, sinus infections, sore throats and hay fever.\n\nParts used include the leaf, the stem, and small pieces of the flowers. Typical preparations include a warm compress or tea. Eyebright preparations are also available as an extract or capsule.\n\nA report from the European Medicines Agency states about the efficacy of Euphrasia remedies:\n\nFrom the presence of secondary metabolites, an astringent and anti-inflammatory activity can be hypothesized for Euphrasia preparations. The ocular use of Euphrasia is based upon tradition. However, since the efficacy of the claimed ocular uses is undocumented and external eye application is not hygienic, therapeutic use cannot be recommended.\n\nThe phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. \"Euphrasia\" belongs to the core Rhinantheae. \"Euphrasia\" is the sister genus to \"Odontites\", \"Bellardia\", \"Tozzia\", and \"Hedbergia\". In turn, these five genera share phylogenetic affinities with \"Bartsia\".\n\nThe genus \"Euphrasia\" is taxonomically complicated due to many species being interfertile and prone to hybridisation. Despite there having been a number of taxonomic revisions the appropriate rank of many taxa, as well as the relationships between them, remains unclear.\n"}

It was founded in 2001 and is named after Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, the 1st Earl of Halifax.\n\nThe college is linked between both main university campuses via the UB1 shuttle bus.\n\nThe College is situated to the south of the main campus, next to the village of Heslington and the University sports fields.\n\nIn 2006/07, Halifax College won the University's College Sport Championship; and successfully held onto the title in the 2007/08 and 2008/09 seasons. They regained the title in the 2010/11 season.\n\nIn the 1990s the University began to rapidly expand, almost doubling in size from 4,300 to 8,500 students, The expansion of student numbers resulted in the creation of more accommodation by the University which was named Halifax Court. The first blocks of Halifax College which formed Ingram, Irwin, Younger, Lindley and Wood Courts were built in the summer of 1996. The members of Halifax Court were members of other colleges however soon formed their own Junior Common Room; the lack of any tie between the campus, colleges, and the houses in Halifax Court led the members form their own Junior Common Room and to demands that Halifax Court be given full college status. In 2002 Halifax Court was made a full College of the University and was renamed as 'Halifax College'.\n\nThe location of the buildings – at the back of the existing (1970s built) St Lawrence Court (used at the time almost exclusively for post-graduate and foreign students) – meant that even the student union paid little attention to the students, despite them forming the largest group at the university.\n\nHalifax Court residents were the first to pay differential rents on their accommodation and lets were a mandatory 38 weeks. All others students, whether in the newer James College blocks or the very dated Derwent blocks paid the same rate. Despite this, accommodation in Halifax in 1997 was £38 a week – £6 more than the rest of campus but still one of the lowest rents in the country.\n\nThe campaign for full status was delayed primarily because of the insistence of the Dean of Halifax Court, Mark Evans and the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) that Halifax Court should have all the facilities of a campus college. At that time, the Halifax Court Centre Building (now JJ's) consisted of a central common room (unlicensed though clearly built with the concept of housing a bar), the only part-time portering service (Geoff the porter) at the university (every other college had 24hr portering at that time), an adjacent laundry room accessed from the outside (now the lounge area of JJ's), and a small convenience store accessed from the outside (now the pizzeria). The building of today is almost unrecognisable from that of this time.\n\nThe lack of desire for a common room (it was very rarely used) and the need for a bar led to the construction of a new building housing the portering service and the shop and the complete refurbishment of the Halifax Court Centre Building into JJ's. The area now occupied by the newer Ainsty and Hickleton Courts (next to the car park) was a large 'village green' for the Halifax Court/College residents. During the summer term this was frequently full of students playing frisbee, having barbecues (strongly against the wishes of the university administration) and studying together.\n\nIn 2009 Halifax College changed its College Crest from its original blue and white shield to newer Crest derived from the Coat of Arms of Lord Halifax while maintaining the College's traditional colour.\n\nUnlike the other Colleges, Halifax does not consist of a main building divided into blocks and corridors. Instead, students live in houses which are grouped together to form courts.\n\nThere are nine Courts in Halifax:\nSt Lawrence Court,\nLindley Court,\nWood Court,\nIngram Court,\nIrwin Court,\nYounger Court,\nAinsty Court, and\nHickleton Court.\n\nAinsty and Hickleton Courts are managed by UPP Projects Ltd as part of the University Partnership Programme. They were built and originally maintained by Jarvis plc.\n\nCollege members with families also live in 'Garrowby Way', an area of housing which is part of Halifax College. McHugh Lane was its first new-build accommodation.\n\nThe other Courts are managed by the College and the University's Accommodation Office. St Lawrence court is the largest court.\n\nJJ's used to be the Halifax College bar and pizzeria. It is believed to have been named after two former College Sports Officers, named John and John, who won a competition to name the new bar. JJ's is now a well equipped and comfortable common room, the largest on campus.\n\nThere is also a small Nisa supermarket.\n\n'FAXY the Lion', the official Halifax mascot introduced in summer 2012, by the HCSA, represents the college at most campus events supporting college sports teams across the university.\n\nIn keeping with the tradition of Oxbridge Colleges being twinned with each other, since 2012 Halifax College has been twinned with Van Mildert College, Durham, Durham University and since 2015 with The County College, Lancaster University.\n\nHalifax College students are represented by the Halifax College Students' Association (HCSA), which represents all students of the College. Halifax was the first College at York to have combined graduate and undergraduate student association.\nIt was also the first to have a 'President' leading the HCSA (unlike the other colleges at the time who had the position of 'Chair').\n\nThe Students' Association provides Halifaxers with a variety of services, including large events, student welfare, volunteering, charity work, recycling, College merchandise, College sports and representation to the College and University. It also organises the College Freshers' Fortnight.\n\nHalifax was the first college at York to offer certified Fairtrade College merchandise and continues to stay on top with many issues.\n\nHalifax College hosts and organises social events such as barcrawls through York, quizzes in JJ’s, court BBQs, trips to various cities or the beach (“Fax off to Scarborough”, anyone?).\n\nIn early 2012 the HCSA led by George Offer re-launched XTRA branded events, presenting the college's famous bar crawls and themed club nights in college.\n\nHalifax Summer Ball is held each year, which in the academic year 2010-2011 was held on a boat, Snow Ball, 'Faxival', Halifax Has Got Talent, and 'Freshers Week which changes in content and length from year to year.\n\nFaxival, is a festival/carnival held throughout the college. Including live music, BBQs, hog roast, a bar, inflatables etc. it was started in 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "2238667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238667", "title": "Clear Communications", "text": "Clear Communications\n\nClear Communications was a telecommunications company based in New Zealand. Until merging into Telstra's operations in 2001, it was the biggest rival to Telecom New Zealand.\n\nPrior to 1987, New Zealand's telecommunications sector was dominated by the New Zealand Post Office, who also provided telephony and telegraph services. In 1987 the Post Office was split into three new businesses - Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, New Zealand Post and PostBank. When Telecom was created in 1987 the firm of Touche Ross was briefed to examine the feasibility of competition in New Zealand's telecommunications industry. Intensive research showed New Zealanders were unimpressed by the prices they were being charged and were not happy with a generally unresponsive service.\n\nBy June 1988 Richard Prebble, then Minister of State Owned Enterprises, announced to the country the intention to de-regulate the telecommunications industry and open the door to competition. The mandate to the new state-owned enterprise, Telecom, was to operate in a profitable manner in a fair and competitive environment. The free and open competition became law with the Telecommunications Amendment Act in December 1988. Full de-regulation for the telecommunications industry came into effect on 1 April 1989.\n\n\"Consumers will benefit substantially from opening up the telecommunications market to competition\", Prebble told New Zealanders in June 1988. He noted that Telecom's competitors would be heavily dependent on it for facilities and services, giving Telecom scope to act anti-competitively if so wished. He added, however, that he had received an assurance in writing from the head of Telecom, Dr Peter Troughton, that Telecom would facilitate the emergence of a competitive market in telecommunications, and that it would provide interconnection to its facilities on fair terms and conditions.\n\nTelecom's activities and the interconnection agreements, fundamental to the successful entry of competitors, were to be subject to the scrutiny of the Commerce Act 1986. The Department of Trade and Industry was also to act as a watchdog to keep telecommunications on a competitive track.\n\nIn 1990, Clear Communications made New Zealand history by establishing itself as the country's first telecommunications competitor.\n\nThere was a keen interest among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as New Zealand Railways Corporation, Electricorp (later ECNZ) and the Broadcast Communications Limited (a subsidiary of Television New Zealand) who saw strong investment opportunities for their microwave, satellite or fibre optic cable capacity. The missing link was the telecommunications switching expertise.\n\nBell Canada International (BCI), MCI Communications (MCI), Cable and Wireless, British Telecom, Telecom Australia and several other prominent overseas telecommunications suppliers with the technological digital switching expertise the New Zealand-based parties were looking for.\n\nBell Canada undertook thorough market research and business plan studies during 1988 lead by George Newton, Sean Howe and Steve Kropper. BCI was moving back into the corporate business of telecommunications and the newly liberalised environment in New Zealand provided the opportunity. Leading New Zealand white wear manufacturer, Fisher and Paykel expressed interest in a joint venture and teamed with BCI in 1989 to investigate the feasibility of an alternate telephone company. Revenues from telecommunications at the time were in excess of NZ$2 billion. Market research showed that most customers would be prepared to change to a competitor if prices were 10 to 20% lower than Telecoms.\n\nHaving emerged in September 1988, Broadcast Communications Limited, with its microwave network for disseminating television signals, indicated a strong desire to be part of a BCI and Fisher & Paykel joint venture.\n\nDue to effects of a weakening economy in the late eighties, Fisher & Paykel decided to bow out. The Wellington-based Todd Corporation was preparing for market entry with American telecommunications giant, MCI.\n\nThree independently researched business plans undertaken during this first phase of investigation of telecommunications opportunities were combined and expanded upon in an Alternative Telecommunications Company (ATC) business plan proposed by Touche Ross, (for TransPower, the bulk electricity network subsidiary of ECNZ), Booz Allen Hamilton (for New Zealand Railways) and Charles Gilmore, ex-General Manager of Telecom (for Todd Corporation) in March 1989.\n\nThe report confirmed that viable competition required a balance of established overseas telephone company expertise, commercial experience and funds, and State Owned Enterprise transmission network infrastructure. It also confirmed that the market place was big enough for just one major competitor to Telecom.\n\nAs the various parties began to align with each other, two groups emerged. Broadcasting Communications Limited (BCL), the subsidiary of TVNZ, teamed with BCI to publish a market study and business plan for the establishment of the Alternative Telecommunications Company. TVNZ was looking for the factor with would differentiate their alternate telecommunications company from Telecom.\n\nAt the helm of the BCI team was George Newton who had risen from telephone technician to executive level in the Canadian telecommunications giant. George Newton proceeded immediately to draw up the BCI/BCL business plan. With a team of fourteen to assist, he completed it on 8 December 1989, just four weeks after commencement.\n\nBy February 1990, BCL, TVNZ and BCI had signed a Heads of Agreement to work in partnership on an alternate telecommunications project. Todd Corporation, New Zealand Railways Corporation and American telecommunications company MCI were poised to do likewise. Both parties were aware of the need for more than one set of transmission facilities. TVNZ's microwave transmission and NZ Railway's fibre optic cable were both needed in the event of one failing. Both parties were also acutely aware that there was room for only one competitor in the New Zealand market.\n\nTodd Corporation had not only struck a firm association with the second largest telecommunications network in the world, MCI, and with New Zealand Railways Corporation but had also been instrumental in persuading the SOEs to work together with encouraging results.\n\nOn November 29, 1989, Todd announced the formation of MCI Todd Communications Ltd. The new company would provide competing telecommunications services in New Zealand. Announcing the new company, John Todd, Chairman of the Todd Corporation, said it offered \"a great opportunity to bring new technology and service products to the country's 2.4 million telephone users.\"\n\nThe international expertise and investment of MCI, together with New Zealand Railways fibre optic cable running along the North Island Main Trunk railway (between Auckland and Wellington) and the financial support of one of New Zealand's leading corporates constituted serious competition.\n\nTodd MCI had access to the North Island through New Zealand Railways' fibre optic cable. The BCI/BCL group had access to national coverage through BCL's microwave facility. George Newton convinced BCI's principals in North America to carry on with their venture. In March 1990, all of the parties, TVNZ, Todd, BCI and MCI met in the latter's offices in Washington. This began the merger process.\n\nBoth sides had prepared details for interconnection agreements but Neil Tuckwell, an Australian competitive telecommunications expert who had been contracted to TVNZ had, together with Robert Brydon, met the Minister of Commerce to discuss interconnection. In February 1990, the senior representatives of the two groups were brought together - Julian Mounter, Ted Trimmer, Senior Vice President Business Development for MCI, John Hunn, Stewart Berry, Vice President Sales for Bell Canada and George Newton. They worked out what was needed in New Zealand to set up a competitive company and agreed to work together.\n\nOn 20 April 1990, a Memorandum of Understanding to form a single organization to compete in the telecommunications industry was signed between the two consortiums. This led to the creation of The Alternate Telecommunications Company (ATC) on 1 August 1990, the four main shareholders being TVNZ, BCI, Todd Corporation and MCI. New Zealand Railways Corporation was to have Board representation and equity options.\n\nThe two business plans were then brought together - Todd MCI's venture was going to cost $80 million, and the BCI/BCL venture was to cost an estimated $125 million.\n\nGeorge Newton was appointed Chief Executive of the ATC and he and Robert Brydon, Ted Trimmer, Darryl Dorrington and Neil Tuckwell began work on the agreements needed before the company could begin trading.\n\nAmong the eighteen Conditions Precedent, the main ones included a Heads of Agreement with Telecom, a service agreement with BCL and New Zealand Railways Corporation (the Railways Corporation was split into two in October 1990, with the fibre optic circuits going to a new entity, New Zealand Rail Limited) to provide their respective microwave and fibre optic cable facilities, an agreement with TransPower, service agreements with BCI and MCI to contract experienced people from North America, approval from the Commerce Commission and foreign investment approval.\n\nOne of the roadblocks for new entrants had been the absence of a specific telecommunications regulatory body. Telecom had established the Permission to Connect (PTC) document, the lifeblood of the business. This meant that the dominant carrier was setting the rules. And since Telecom had not contemplated local service or 0800 service competition, the Agreement with Telecom would prove the most difficult to achieve. Staff en route from North America to join the new ATC told the minister, Richard Prebble, that they would cancel their network switch order due to the delays in getting an agreement with Telecom. ATC then agreed to defer cancelling while the Minister got Telecom to the table.\n\nOn 24 August 1990 Telecom had publicly welcomed the merger of the joint ventures and stated that competition was \"healthy for the industry and would benefit all our customers.\" A memorandum of Agreement was signed with Telecom covering toll by-pass, alternative networks, local services and 0800. \n\nA shareholders agreement was concluded and signed on 4 September and shareholders funds, available for the first time, were in excess of NZ$100 million. The four main shareholders would each initially have 25% equity.\n\nATC's first consignment of switching equipment arrived in New Zealand in November that year and installation commenced. Neil Tuckwell moved from TVNZ over to ATC. His move coincided with ATC's shift from temporary offices at Quay Tower in Auckland to permanent accommodation at 49 Symonds Street. In Wellington, the following month, ATC moved to permanent premises in Murphy Street.\n\nThe company's General Manager Sales & Marketing David Patten charged his second in command, Sandy Fain, with coming up with the right name. Impressed with the quality of customer service offered by the advertising people at Leo Burnett, Sandy briefed them on the company's values. 25 names were proffered and poured over arriving at Clear Communications.\n\nThe name was fresh, lively and modern and held the required balance between strength and simplicity. It mirrored the company's values. The logo reflected the clean, bright colours of New Zealand.\n\nOn 14 November 1990, the first full board meeting of the new company was held with John Ede as Chairman of the Board and George Newton CEO. The board confirmed the name which was unveiled to staff on a plinth in the lobby of the company headquarters.\n\nClear Communications commenced leased line operations in January 1991. On 12 February an agreement was signed with Transpower to use their fibre optic system in the South Island and seven days later, Minister of Communications Maurice Williamson, made the historic first call on the new network between Wellington and Auckland, using New Zealand Rail's fibre optic cable. The new entrant was able to offer toll service bills charged in steps of one-tenth of a minute. Telecom's lowest charge step was one minute.\n\nIt was thanks to Telecom who, on the evening before the agreed connection date, had delayed issuing the permit Clear required to link Telecom's toll system and launch its prices and toll services. The interconnection agreement for toll by-pass had been signed on March 4, although a second deal allowing Clear access to Telecom's local services was still being negotiated. Interconnection, the linchpin connecting two or more telecommunications networks, allows calls to flow between them. It is critical to the promotion of a competitive market; customers of one network need to be able to communicate with customers of the other, and customers of one network need to access the competitive services of another.\n\nClear's plan was to make its services available to 80% of the telephones in New Zealand, thus offering New Zealanders a choice of their toll service provider. It has developed two separate national toll services; Clear Business 050 to serve the needs of the business market and Clear 051 designed for the residential customer. Customers had been tested on the Clear network in April. At the eleventh hour, when Telecom had still not issued the interconnection permit, Clear took the bull by the horns, went public and got front page publicity. The breakthrough to full commercial operations offering Clear 05 and Clear Business 050 came on 7 May 1991.\n\nThe launch advertising projected the principles of fairness and value. British talk show host Michael Aspen was chosen from a list of 200 to front the advertisements. The advertisements raised were objected to by Telecom who took issue with the application of the word \"fair\". Two years later Telecom took Clear to court with its advertising headline: \"If you want to get the best deal on tolls from Telecom you'd be a Clear customer.\" The Telecom number was then printed underneath inviting customers to ask for two months of free toll calls to match the current Clear offer.\n\nClear was also obliged to seek an injunction to prevent Telecom from capitalising on a list of Clear customers supplied to Telecom for implementation of no-code access. By mid-1993, Telecom was processing Clear customers at a rate of 3000 lines a week using the list of Clear customers requiring conversations. When Telecom began writing to Clear customers as a part of the marketing campaign, Clear was granted an injunction.\n\nClear and Telecom were awaiting an Appeal Court decision over the terms for access to the local customer. The original December 1992 court decision found Telecom in breach of Section 36 of the Commerce Act, which prohibits the use of a dominant position for the purpose of preventing or deterring competition. The section underlies the government's telecommunications policy to prevent anti-competitive behaviour.\n\nThe two breaches were for not supplying Clear with Direct Dial-In (DDI) numbers which would have allowed Clear to start local service operations, and for asking for too much money for interconnecting Clear to its network. However, the decision also indicated Telecom's \"Baumol-Willig\" economic formula - whereby new entrants should compensate Telecom for lost profits - would not be anti-competitive in the future and a framework was proposed which, it was hoped by the court decision, would promote negotiations between Clear and Telecom.\n\nClear took its objection to this finding back to Court in August 1993 but the resolution of these issues, all related to the cost and terms of access to various parts of the Telecom system, is still awaited. Telecom has argued that the prices it has charged Clear to use its network were fair because of the increments it needed to add to provide the capacity Clear requested. Clear's view has been that Telecom, in the absence of an effective referee have behaved like a de facto regulator. For example, it has practised price bundling whereby monopoly and competitive products are bundled for an overall discount, to the disadvantage of competitors. For as long as that situation was allowed to continue, Clear has maintained that New Zealanders would not reap the full benefits of competitive telecommunications.\n\nA national telephone survey conducted by Insight Research on February 1993 showed that 66% of the 750 people surveyed believed Telecom was taking advantage of its position with only 15% indicating that Clear was getting a fair go. At the same time, almost 70% of the survey participants attributed the benefits in price and service that had been achieved to Clear's competitive stance. Prices for toll calls had reduced by almost half since Clear entered the ring.\n\nWith the rise of the competition came the fall of toll prices and an overall improvement in the level of customer service.\n\nClear's efficient billing system was the main driver in the differentiation process. The bills went out accurately and on time. Calls not captured within a ninety-day billing period were not charged. Business customers could choose to aggregate their call volumes from multiple locations to maximize savings while still receiving separate account statements for each location. All customers had a choice of billing cycles.\n\nCredit was offered on a call if a customer was not satisfied. 80% of inquiries were resolved on the first customer contact. Capacity was monitored on individual routes to avoid the blocking of calls. Quality control criteria were designed which were constantly monitored to ensure a standard of service equal to the best available anywhere in the world. There was a calculated risk and considerable cost in setting bold new standards of customer service. But Clear already had a nationwide reputation for trendsetting. And, in the words of Customer Services Manager Dan Rogers, “Cancellations are below expectations - but every lost customer is lost forever.\"\n\nBy June 1992, ClearCard and Familiar voices were launched, followed by telemarketing and PhonePower in July. \"Familiar Voices\" was a value-added toll system which provided call duration discounts to customers who nominated people the would be calling on a regular basis. PhonePower provided business consulting and training services to maximize productivity and profits in areas such as sales, marketing, order processing, sales support, customer service and cash management.\n\nThe marketing pitched simultaneously at national accounts (top Corporates and government), general and retail business and residential. The promise was to offer services at 12 to 15% cheaper than what had been available from Telecom and the promise was kept.\n\nFor calls both within New Zealand and internationally, the pricing policy was based on charging in one-second increments (after the first minute). Additional benefits were call duration discounts for residential customers during off-peak hours and volume discounts for business customers.\n\nClear was first off the telecommunications block with an automated telephone charge card service. Called ClearCard, it allowed Clear customers to make national and international toll (and local) calls over the Clear network from any telephone in New Zealand; and for calls to New Zealand from any telephone in Australia, USA and UK.\n\nTelecom held out on providing an access code number until Clear explained what it was for. Within two months, Telecom had its own card on the market. Clear, introduced its toll-free 0508, an incoming tolls service that allowed customers to receive calls from anywhere in New Zealand (except for cellular or pay-phones) at no charge to the caller.\n\nClear's market share grew faster than predicted. The aim, three years from the launch date, was for 5% market share and a staff of 175. By the close of 1993 market share had reached almost 19% and Clear's staff numbered 500. A year later, it achieved the most improved turnover among New Zealand's top 200 companies.\n\nWithin six months of commencing operations, Clear attracted more than 30,000 customers. In its first year of operation, it had won 9% of the New Zealand national toll market.\n\nBy September 1992 Clear had more than 430 staff representing an annual growth of 200 jobs per annum. In the same month, auto telephone dialers were introduced to the market. They were designed to interface with customers' PABX and Telecom lines to ensure that all toll calls would connect to Clear.\n\nThe company had more than 14% of the market and over 90,000 customers by November 1992. The growth continued, despite the costly legal battles. Through interconnection with Telecom network, Clear's toll services had become available to more than 80% of the telephone network, Clear's toll service had become available to more than 80% of the telephone lines in New Zealand. Residents in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Nelson and Invercargill were able to access Clear services. Further locations would come online later in the year to meet Clear's objective to make its services available to all New Zealand telecommunications users.\n\nThe first major sponsorship Clear made was in January 1992 when Clear joined six other New Zealand companies to sponsor the New Zealand Endeavour in the Whitbread race.\n\nThe $2 million sponsorship was considerable for a small company engaged in expensive battles with Telecom. And because the race would extend over two years and be closely followed by more than 90% of the New Zealanders, it was a logical choice for support. Support for Crippled Children's Society (CCS) was also given for commercial as well as community reasons. Clear customers were able to contribute to CCS by making calls on the Clear network as part of Friends of CCS fundraising program.e. When a customer joined the fundraising program Clear donated 3% of his or her monthly bill to CCS\n\nSimilarly, Clear linked with the Pakuranga Rotary Club to encourage the planting of native New Zealand trees with the launch of a national Trees for Survival program. To support the programme, Clear offered an affiliation scheme for Rotarians so that 5% of the Clear toll account would be paid by Clear to the Trees for Survival Programme.\n\nThe important area of education was also selected by Clear for support. Observing the pressure on schools to find the extra money to undertake worthwhile projects, Clear came up with a simple but smart formula. It provided parents and members of the community who were Clear customers with a way of directly supporting the primary school of their choice. Friends of the School was launched in Wanganui in September 1992. Clear customers were subsequently able to nominate a primary school on the programme to receive 5% of their monthly clear toll payment and the Friends of the School programme has become nationwide with 1100 school participating from kindergarten through to high school.\n\nBy mid-1993, Clear furthered its commitment to education by sponsoring Spellbound, a spelling quiz that benefited schools financially. An annual school essay with prizes up to $5000 was also launched.\n\nFollowing interconnection, Clear opened its Christchurch sales office in June 1991. The purchase of the DMS300 switch for international service followed in July and the 10,000th customer signed up in August. Staff numbers had reached 200. Just 12 months before there had been 15 people in Auckland and four in Wellington.\n\nBy December, the Dunedin sales office opened, the first direct international service came online with 60 circuits on satellite, quickly followed by expansion to 120 circuits, and Clear's 30,000th customer signed up. In January 1992, Clear's network capacity to Christchurch increased with the commissioning of fibres in the Transpower cable.\n\nIn December 1991, Clear began operating the first stage of its own international telecommunications network with the installation of a 7.5 metre Intelsat satellite dish next to Auckland's Carlaw Park. The second dish of 15.5 meters diameter was added in June 1992. Clear was now connected to the new Tasman Fibre optic cable and had direct access to MCI and other carrier networks. The company became virtually independent of Telecom's facilities for most of its international calls.\n\nHowever, Telecom remained the major obstacle by remaining firm on charging what Clear considered to be less than fair and reasonable interconnection prices. Access to the local market was also stymied by Telecom who owned and controlled most of the critical inputs. Clear contended that by having to pay full commercial rates to Telecom for services provided, it was paying more for equivalent services than many of Telecom's business customers.\n\nThe level playing field the government had envisaged was without an effective referee. Telecom was largely calling the shots by setting the rules under which competition was permitted to take place. Many of the subsidiary issues revolved around the fundamental interconnection agreement such as numbering and billing systems, cellular networks, pricing, advertising, directories and local business services.\n\nTelecom agreed to let Clear customers have non-code access (being able to make toll calls through Clear without daily 050) when its share of the national toll market reached 9%. Clear reached the 9% threshold within a year of beginning operations, as opposed to the two to three years anticipated by Telecom. By 1993, Clear was supplying some customers with non-code access but agreement over the cost of access had not been reached. The decision, when finally reached, would determine whether Clear could afford to extend that service to all customers.\n\nInitially, Clear relied solely on Telecom for international calls, but early in 1992 it commissioned independent facilities. It had its own satellite earth receiving station in Auckland and was a member of the Tasman-2 fibre optic cable consortium linking New Zealand and Australia. It was also a member of the consortium owning the PacRim East fibre optic cable between New Zealand and Hawaii.\n\nClear achieved approximately 22% of market share in domestic toll services by 1993, reduced to 18% by 1999, and 20% for international toll services. Clear's share of the market, by the middle of 1993, had grown to 16% of the national and 18% of the international toll market with more than 170,000 customers. The latter had increased to 200,000 by the time of Clear's third birthday on 4 September 1993, the day the shareholder's agreement was signed. The employees had grown to more than 500 in number.\n\nIn August 1993 Clear was selected as one of the finalists for the inaugural NZ Quality Awards.\n\nChief Executive Andrew Makin succeeded George Newton in August 1993. By the end of 1993, the North American contingent was down for the original 66 to eight.\n\nIn November 1993 New Zealand Rail acquired 3.1 million shares in Clear, as part of an option gained by New Zealand Rail for use of its fibre optic cables.\n\nIn September 1994 Clear began to provide an 0800 freephone service in competition with Telecom. Prior to this, its freephone service had used the code 0508. In addition to utilizing digital microwave telecommunication links owned by Broadcast Communications Ltd, Clear initially leased, then purchased, from New Zealand Rail (in return for a 15% stake in the company, which New Zealand Rail then sold in 1994) fibre optic cables linking Auckland and Wellington. It also leased fibre optic capacity between Wellington and Christchurch from Electricorp. The company also had digital microwave links with the major provincial cities of New Zealand. It installed further fibre optic capacity between Wellington and Auckland to increase transmission capacity and provide route diversity. Fibre loops and duct lines were installed in the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch central business districts.\n\nClear and Telecom had 25 actual and 19 notional points of interconnect (POI) throughout New Zealand. In the areas served by a notional point of interconnect, calls from Clear's customers were trunked to the nearest Telecom telephone exchange with billing facilities, at which point they were physically handed over to Clear. After conveying the call on its own network, Clear linked back into Telecom's network at the appropriate POI.\n\nIn September 1995 Clear reached a new agreement on local service interconnection with Telecom which culminated in a formal local telephone service interconnect agreement in March 1996. This agreement also included new toll bypass interconnect arrangements.\n\nIn March 1996, British Telecom (BT) acquired Bell Canada's 25% stake in Clear. Clear launched its internet service, ClearNet, later in 1996 and had about 10,000 customers by May 1997. It also provided the first commercial ATM service and had an ISDN offering.\n\nCEO Andrew Makin resigned, and was replaced by Tim Cullinane.\n\nIn June 1999, BT bought the whole of Clear. In August, BT paid down Clear's bank debt of NZ$170 million.\n\nIn 2000, Clear signed a deal with Vodafone New Zealand to give its customers the use of a mobile network. CEO Tim Cullinane resigned.\n\nClear was acquired by TelstraSaturn to form TelstraClear for $143 million.\n\nInformation Systems at Clear was never a \"back-office\" cost-reduction function - but rather a key strategic element of the business plan.\n\nBruce Macleod (General Manager of Information Systems) was given responsibility for Clear’s Information Systems from the pre-launch (Alternate Telecommunications Company) business plan, through the initial build and start-up stages, the early product launches, the rapid growth and commercial success, and the ongoing competitive differentiation.\n\nIn this era before the internet arrived, technology use was generally limited to isolated groups of personal computers, and perhaps a departmental mini-computer or a specialized mainframe. Traditional Telecom companies were typically restricted by this inflexible “vertical silo” style of departmental computer systems.\n\nIn contrast, the IS team at Clear designed a forward-looking corporate-wide layered architecture to permit a nimble response to turning creative marketing ideas into operational product realities. Service Features were quickly created by configuring the upper layers of workflow and applications without having to rework the versatile lower layers.\n\nLayered architecture:\n\n\nUpon arrival, all employees were equipped with office services such as Email, file servers, spreadsheets, and project management tools to allow them to quickly engage with the rest of the Clear team on priorities and projects. The centrepiece highly-configurable Customer Service and Billing application was acquired from Telecom USA (a recent MCI acquisition). In each other area, “best of breed” applications and any required hardware and software were acquired from global technology partners and locally adapted to fit needs. The “business process engineering” approach was a key factor recognized in Clear’s achievement in the “NZ Quality Awards”.\n\nIn keeping with the overall Clear culture, the Information Systems group was organizationally aligned with, co-located, and integrated into the company’s comprehensive teams. That is IS-Product Development under Tom Barrett, IS-Network Engineering under Allison Nowlan, and IS-Business/Financial Analysis under Stan Clarke. Another team was dedicated to the design, deployment, and ongoing operation of the foundation technology platform (under Brian Speed and Vlad Ruzicka).\n\nAs Clear progressed from start-up to a successful self-sustaining business, the IS Team developed not only the requisite technology investments, but also the required staffing, skills, tools, and processes. The initial experienced “pioneer” North American people noted above gradually transitioned to a strong “next generation” of well-equipped NZ professionals steeped in the distinct Clear corporate culture.\n\n"}

To the east is the city of Kelkheim, to the south the city of Hofheim, and to the west the city of Wiesbaden and the municipality of Niedernhausen.\n\nEppstein consists of five areas: Bremthal, Ehlhalten, Eppstein, Niederjosbach and Vockenhausen.\n\nBremthal has a rapid-transit railway stop on line S2. With approximately 5000 inhabitants, Bremthal is the most populous quarter of Eppstein, and is the economic and cultural centre. Bremthal has several associations e.g. a brass band, Germania singing association, Liederkranz singing association, an association of small animal breeders and a volunteer fire brigade.\n\nBremthal was founded by the Lords of Eppstein in the 10th/11th century because the narrow valley around their castle did not allow for arable land. Bremthal's church, St. Margareta, was built in 1889. The church has a baptismal font (1749) from an earlier church on the site.\n\nA small skate park and forest adventure path off the Wildsachsenerstraße are fun for children.\n\nNiederjosbach has a rapid-transit railway stop on line S2 as well as a bus connection to the Wiesbadener transportation network.\n\nMotorway connections are about 3 minutes away. In Niederjosbach is a large campsite, the very well-maintained terrace-like \"Taunuscamp\", which is on the Sonnenhang. It is open all year round. The GCC - Gusbacher Carnevalsclub - organizes several meetings annually, and on \"carnival Tuesday\", a noteworthy parade by the village's local associations; two sport clubs, two singing clubs, a fruit and horticulture club, church choir, fire-brigade, \"Gusbacher chaoten\" (carnival parade organisers), federation of housewives, German Red Cross local association and neighbourhood municipalities. There is an industrial area and several craft enterprises, as well as an urban kindergarten with three groups. The Catholic community centre \"Am Honigbaum\" (\"at the honey tree\") is used for church and also for private and other social meetings. The place has been part of Eppstein since 1972. The Niederjosbach coat of arms has a silver fir tree on a red background.\n\nVockenhausen is the seat of the mayor. It has around 4500 people. The administration is distributed between the two city halls in Vockenhausen and Eppstein. On the Vockenhäuser \"Gemarkung\" are the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Schule (comprehensive school) and the Burg-Schule (primary school).\n\nThis \"Stadtteil\" of Eppstein was founded around 1100 by the Lords of Eppstein and belonged to them until they died out in 1535. Historically, the area was a site for manufacturing. A number of mills (e.g. for grinding grain, dye-making, leather-tanning, and iron extraction) made use of the stream that runs through the town.\n\nThe sculpture before the Vockenhausen turn-off between Alt-Eppstein and Bremthal is a reminder of Vockenhausen's \"Schmelzmühle\" (smelting mill) as well as Vockenhausen's two well-known artists Robert and Ella Bergmann-Michel, who lived at the mill from the 1920s until their deaths.\n\nThe sunny hillside of Vockenhausen is home to many families and Eppstein's elementary and middle schools; the valley has a number of traditional German, as well as Greek, Italian, and Chinese restaurants, a few bakeries, guest houses, hair salons, doctors' offices, a tanning and waxing salon, drugstores, dry cleaners/post office, and local grocery stores.\n\nThe \"Bergstraße\" — also called the \"Schmerzberg\" (\"Pain Mountain\") during an annual 1 May bike race — goes over the hill to Alt-Eppstein.\n\nEhlhalten is the part with the fewest inhabitants (about 1350) but the largest area due to its rather big forests. According to legend, Ehlhalten once provided a cutter that tailors used at the water of the brook in Ehlhalten. As the water rose and fell, affecting the measurement of the inch, people cried: \"Elle halten!\" (\"hold the inch!\"), leading to the name Ehlhalten.\n\nEhlhalten was also the name of a settlement in the municipal forest near a source. It was burned down however by soldiers and destroyed completely. In 2004 Ehlhalten competed in the final of the series \"Dolles Dorf\" on hr television, winning a third prize in this show about different villages in Hesse.\n\nEppstein station is on the Main-Lahn Railway and is served by line S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn, running between Niedernhausen and Dietzenbach via Frankfurt and the town is around 3 km from the A3 Autobahn. Bundesstraße 455 passes through the town.\n\nThe Stanniolfabrik Eppstein is in the central part Eppstein, beneath the castle. They are manufacturing tin foil and similar metal foils for highly specialised applications. It has become famous due to an appearance in the television series MythBusters, because they supplied lead foil for the lead ballon myth.\n\nRUCO printing inks (A. M. Ramp & Co GmbH) also has a facility here.\n\n\"for the educational system in Germany, see Education in Germany\"\n\nEppstein has two primary schools and one comprehensive school. In addition, the Hessen-Thüringen bank academy is located here. The Eppstein-Rossert music school and the Eppstein music society offer instruction in various musical instruments.\n\nIn Eppstein Vockenhausen, near the training and sports centre at the Bienroth, is the \"Burg-Schule\" (\"castle school\"). It is somewhat larger with approx. 300 pupils than the \"Commenius-Schule,\" which is the primary school for pupils from Eppstein's parts Bremthal and Niederjosbach.\n\nEppstein's comprehensive school, the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gesamtschule, is located at the sports and school centre \"Am Bienroth\". Five-hundred and sixty students in the fifth to tenth years attend the school, which is divided into three sections: Hauptschule (year 5 to 9), Realschule and Gymnasium (both year 5 to 10).\nA special feature of the school is the annual exchange of students with Eppstein's twinned town of Kenilworth, England, as well as a school in Tours, France. Every two years the school also hosts an exchange with the Bornova Anadolu Lisesi in İzmir, Turkey.\n\nThe school is known for a tragic attack: on 3 June 1983 a man shot three children, one teacher and a police officer dead. The attacker then committed suicide. 14 were injured.\n\nEppstein is twinned with four different towns:\n\nThe ruins of the Eppstein castle (first mention in 1122--\"Ebbensten\") give character to the old city centre of Eppstein.\n\nThe museum in Eppstein's castle is in the one building within the castle walls which was spared breakup in the early 19th century. You'll notice the baroque altar in the back, which Eppstein's Catholics acquired when they used the building as their chapel after the valley church (Talkirche) became Protestant during the Reformation. Upstairs are some books written by early travel writers who refer to Eppstein, including a copy of Dumas's , as well as paintings of the castle, some painted by members of one of the first painters' colonies in Germany—the \"Kronberger Malerkolonie.\"\nAt the foot of the castle, in the middle of the historical old city, is the Talkirche (Valley Church), which today accommodates Eppstein's evangelical parish.\n\nEppstein's turn-of-the-century train station (1903) has been newly renovated and houses not only an RMV counter (Rhine-Main bus and commuter train information counter), the Bürgerbüro (citizens' information center), but also a restaurant/cafe.\n\nThe Villa Anna, above the train station, was built in the 1880s by the wealthy Frankfurt businessman Alfred von Neufville. Its grounds were designed by the famous landscaper Andreas Weber (who also designed the Frankfurt Zoo). With 200 exotic trees and bushes, its park is one of only two \"Bergparks\" (mountainside parks) in all of Hesse.\n\nThe Neufville Tower was built by the Neufvilles to house their private art collection and to serve as their \"Jagdhaus\" (hunting lodge).\n\nEppstein's beautification society keeps up a number of scenic overlooks, most of them built over a century ago during the flowering of Eppstein as a \"Luftkurort\" (climatic spa town).\n\nThe \"Pionier-Tempel,\" an iron structure, earlier nicknamed the \"omnibus\" or \"tram temple,\" is a five-minute walk from the train station. It was built in 1889 by the 2nd company of the \"pionier\" (engineer) battalion XI from Mainz-Kastel. In four days, 500 men cut the forest path between the Eppstein train station and Wildsachsen for the transport of timber. When they finished, in keeping with the late 18th-century English tradition of landscape gardens dotted by gazebos and observation points, they built the scenic overlook.\n\nThe Kaisertempel with its Doric columns was built in 1894 as a memorial to commemorate the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71), which unified the German Empire under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. From the temple, there is a wonderful view of Eppstein as far as Bremthal.\n\nThe annual bicycle race Rund um den Henninger-Turm (around the Henninger tower) runs through Eppstein, on the first of May each year.\n\nSince 2003 the Taunus Trails mountain bike marathon, open to everyone, takes place each summer.\n\nRegular events at the castle include the Burgfestspiele (castle festival) in summer. In the inner court of the castle, drama groups present classic works as well as new productions. Another notable highlight is the Saxdays.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Besides his own group, Newcombe has worked with a number of bands, most notably The Dandy Warhols, The High Dials, The Manvils, Innaway, and The Quarter After. He recorded and produced Dead Meadow's album \"Got Live if You Want It\", and has recorded a cover of Ewan MacColl's song 'Dirty Old Town' with Lorraine Leckie on her 2008 album \"Four Cold Angels\".\n\nNewcombe founded The Brian Jonestown Massacre in San Francisco, California in 1990. Core members in the early years included Matt Hollywood, Jeffrey Davies, Joel Gion, Travis Threlkel, Peter Hayes (BRMC), Patrick Straczek, Ricky Maymi, Brian Glaze, Elise Dye and Dean Taylor, though the line up was subject to frequent changes. Newcombe wrote the majority of songs, with Hollywood collaborating or contributing others on occasion until his departure in 1998, whereupon Newcombe's name became almost synonymous with the BJM. Newcombe was also heavily involved in the post-production of his albums, often engineering and mixing them on his own.

According to the official website, the purpose of the label is to \"...release BJM music not available through other channels, and to record new bands which we will be producing from time to time, while pursuing the goal of making the world unsafe for rock and roll\". Many of the releases on this label are produced or engineered by Rob Campanella.\n\nIn 2016 he composed the soundtrack for British indie film Moon Dogs, directed by Philip John.\n\nPart of Newcombe's life is featured prominently in the documentary film \"Dig!\" which focuses on the tense relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols as both bands struggle for success.\nNewcombe has battled drug addiction, alcoholism and depression. He lives in Berlin with his wife Katy and their son Wolfgang and actively works on his musical projects.\n\nIn recent years, Newcombe has mostly worked from his own recording studio in Berlin, where he produced albums for other artists, including Dead Meadow and remixed tracks for The Vacant Lots.\n\n"}
{"id": "2238674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238674", "title": "Breakout (military)", "text": "Breakout (military)\n\nA breakout is a military operation to end a situation of investment, through offensive operations that achieve a breakthrough. It is used in contexts such as: \"The British breakout attempt from Normandy\". It is one of four possible outcomes of investment, the others being relief, surrender, or reduction.\n\nA breakout is achieved when an invested force launches an attack on the confining enemy forces and achieves a breakthrough, meaning that they successfully occupy positions beyond the original enemy front line and can advance from that position toward an objective or to reunite with friendly forces from which they were separated.\n\nTo be categorized a breakout, an invested force is not necessarily required to be completely encircled by an enemy force. Rather, they may have their movement partially restricted by a terrain feature or potentially the use of an area denial weapon such as the VX nerve agent. This was the case in 1944 in the Saint Lo Breakout, where a large portion of the force's movement was restricted by water and not in fact by enemy positions.\n\nWhile this may be true of a beachhead, it is not necessarily true of a bridgehead. If the bridge is sufficient in capacity compared to the size of the force, and does not significantly restrict their movement, then it does not represent a sufficient barrier for the force to be considered encircled. Similarly, open water may not be a barrier in the same right.\n\nConsider a small detachment of marines with more than sufficient amphibious transports and a significant military presence at sea, such as the beginning stages of the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. Had they evacuated to sea, they would retain a significant military presence, as they were principally a naval military force. Conversely, consider the military evacuation of British troops at Dunkirk during the Second World War. This force clearly was pressed by the enemy, and when it broke out (for that's what they did) they lost their effective strength as a fighting force. They were, at the base of it, a land force escaping, and not an amphibious force maneuvering.\n\nThe key feature here is the loss of freedom of maneuver. If a force can easily overcome a terrain feature, while maintaining its fighting strength, then it is not breaking out; it is maneuvering in the same way any force would over non-restrictive terrain.\n\nA breakout attempt need not result in a breakthrough, such as the 4th Panzer Army suffered during Operation Winter Storm or the British 1st Armored Division suffered at Campoleone. This is referred to as a failed breakout. A breakout may be attempted in conjunction with relief, and this may be essential especially if the invested force has already experienced failed breakout attempts (again, as in Winter Storm).\n\nAs the situation on the Western Front during the First World War has been widely regarded as a single continent-long siege, rather than a series of distinct battles, it is possible to consider offensive action from the Allies as a type of breakout. In this sense the Allied armies may be considered encircled, albeit on a hitherto unheard of scale, with the German army to their east, the Alps and the Pyrenees to their south, and the sea to their west and north. Indeed, as the Dunkirk evacuation illustrated, despite having by far the largest navy in the world, the amphibious movements of these armies was nearly impossible logistically. Similarly, as seen at the Battle of Sarikamish, mountainous terrain remained a significant obstacle to military movement and could inflict numerous casualties.\n\nBreakout maneuvers, despite their own myriad risks, may become necessary by a number of disadvantages encircled forces suffer.\n\n\nThe invested force suffers from the disadvantages resulting from occupying a confined space and also from those resulting from a lack of resupply. Therefore, the encircling force has a significant tactical advantage and also have the advantage of time. It may, in fact, choose to not engage their enemy at all and simply wait it out, leading to eventual exhaustion of ammunition if the invested force gives battle or to the eventual exhaustion of food and water otherwise.\n\nThe US Army lists four conditions, one of which normally exists when a force attempts a breakout maneuver:\n\n\nOf necessity, the broad concept is subject to interpretation. In \"The Blitzkrieg Myth\", John Mosier questions whether the concept as applied to tank and other warfare in World War II was more misleading to planning than it is helpful, on account of the numerous exceptional conditions faced in war and also whether evaluation based largely on how well breakout or breakthrough potential was realized is appropriate\n\nAn example is the battle of Hube's Pocket on the Eastern Front in World War II, where the German First Panzer Army was encircled by Soviet forces but broke out by attacking west and linking with the II SS Panzer Corps, which was breaking into the encirclement from outside.\n\n"}

The 2015 edition contains 1385 hymns and songs.\n\nIt originated as Mission England Praise, prepared for Billy Graham's 1984 Mission England campaign. In its \"words only\" form, it was a thin booklet of 282 pieces, with a wide mixture of hymns and worship songs. Some conservative Christians saw it as a way of bringing what they perceived as charismatic choruses into mainstream church worship.\n\nWhile its language is recognizably modern in many ways, Mission Praise does not use gender-neutral language, in the way that (for example) the Canadian Anglican Common Praise hymnary does.\n\nMission Praise has been through a number of editions. Each edition has a words only book in both regular and large print and a music book. The second booklet (\"Mission Praise 2\"), came out in 1987, and contained songs 283 to 647.\n\nThe various editions have owed much to The Jubilate Group for their copyright controlled hymnody.\n\nA new edition Mission Praise Combined was released in 1993; featuring an extra two hundred songs; expanding the collection from 647 to 798 items and renumbering and reindexing all items in approximate alphabetical order.\n\nIn 1999, Complete Mission Praise was published, increasing the number of hymns to 1021. The 2005 edition, produced under the Collins imprint, adds a further 123 songs from the last few years. \"Complete Mission Praise: 25th Anniversary Edition\" was published in 2009 and added another 106 new songs resulting in 1,250 overall.\n\nThe editions subsequent to 1993 maintain the numeric sequence of the songs in the previous editions, resulting in several separate alphabetical sequences of songs in the latest edition.\n\nIn January 2008, \"Mission Praise\" became the first major hymnbook to be available online. The new website enabled subscribers to access words, sheet music and MIDI files of the songs in \"Mission Praise\" and its sister products \"Carol Praise\" and \"Junior Praise\".

He was one of the best defensive outfielders of his time, receiving six consecutive Gold Gloves from 1980 through 1985. He is currently the minor league assistant hitting coach and outfield coordinator for the Texas Rangers, after previously serving as a coach in the Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays organizations.\n\nMurphy was born in Merced, California, about 120 miles from Oakland. After graduating from Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, California, Murphy was drafted in the 15th round in the 1973 draft by the Oakland Athletics, after turning down a football scholarship from Arizona State University. He came up to the majors for the first time in 1978 at age 23. He would spend the large bulk of his career with Oakland.\n\nMurphy struggled in his rookie year. While he only played in 60 games that season, he managed to collect just 10 hits in 52 plate appearances (giving him an .182 batting average) and he did not hit a home run. His numbers improved as he became the A's everyday center fielder. His power numbers grew as well. The Athletics in the early 1980s had an outfield of Murphy, Rickey Henderson, and Tony Armas, and many saw it as the best young outfield in baseball.\n\nThe A's made the playoffs in 1981, where they lost to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series. In those playoffs, Murphy hit .421 and hit one home run in six games. Murphy's biggest offensive year came in 1984, where he hit 33 home runs and drove in 88 runs. Murphy also drew many walks which led to a very high on-base percentage, and had excellent speed on the base paths. He stole 26 bases in both 1980 and 1982.\n\nMurphy hit second in the lineup throughout most of his career with the A's batting behind Rickey Henderson. Henderson credits Murphy for helping him set the single-season stolen-base record of 130 steals in 1982. After Henderson stole his 119th base that season, he pulled the base up out of the ground and kept it. Afterwards, in an interview, he said, \"If I could break this base in half, I'd give the other half to Dwayne Murphy.\" Murphy also credits Henderson with helping him have a good career. \"I took a lot of pitches for him\", Murphy said. \"He made my career, I believe, because I let him steal and that put me in a position to knock in runs. I loved to watch him play. Let him steal second, let him steal third, knock him in. It gave me a respectable career.\"\n\nLike Henderson, Murphy also had good speed. He stole 26 bases in both 1980 and 1982. He also had good power numbers. His biggest offensive year came in 1984, when he hit 33 home runs and drove in 88 runs. He was one of the best defensive players in the game, winning an incredible six straight Gold Gloves from 1980 to 1985. His signature play became a trademark of sorts for him – his hat blowing off his head on virtually every play he made, from tracking down routine fly balls to making spectacular catches deep in the Valley.\n\nDuring his nine years with the Athletics, he played under managers Billy Martin and Tony La Russa.\n\nAfter ten seasons in Oakland, he spent his final two seasons with the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies. He played in 49 games with the Tigers in 1988, hitting .250 and hitting four home runs. In his final season with the Phillies, he hit just .218 and hit 9 home runs.\n\nIn 1990, he joined the Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League in Japan. Injuries limited his effectiveness, and the Swallows released him in August.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Murphy began a coaching career. He coached with the Arizona Diamondbacks from 1998 to 2003, including serving as hitting coach in 2001, when the Diamondbacks won the World Series. In 2005, he was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays as a hitting coach, first for the Blue Jays' triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse SkyChiefs, and then later as a \"roving\" instructor, visiting all the team's minor league clubs to help players with hitting.\n\nHe held that position when he was named the team's first base coach on June 20, 2008, in the wake of Cito Gaston's nomination to replace the fired John Gibbons as Blue Jay manager. Blue Jays' outfielder Adam Lind revealed at the time that he had an intimate relationship with Murphy, \"He keeps me loose\", Lind said. \"He can dish it out and take it, too. Some coaches you have more of a formal, professional relationship with. With him, you have fun. He talks about how good he was, and I tell him how bad he is. Yeah, he had a good career. At least that's what he keeps telling me.\"\n\nOn October 30, 2009 he became the Blue Jays' hitting coach, following the retirement of Gene Tenace. Along with Cito Gaston, Murphy was credited with helping José Bautista's transformation into a superstar by changing his swing. On November 24, 2012, after John Gibbons was re-hired as the team's manager, Murphy was appointed as the Blue Jays' first base coach and outfield coach.\n\nMurphy announced his retirement following the 2013 season. However, on January 13, 2015, he was hired by the Texas Rangers to be their new minor league assistant hitting coach and outfield coordinator.\n\nMurphy is an avid bass guitar player. He helped fund MC Hammer's first label \"Bust It Records\" and first album \"Feel My Power\".\n\nHis brother, Rod Murphy, played minor league baseball for the Victoria Mussels, Utica Blue Sox and Modesto A’s.\n\n"}
{"id": "2238706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238706", "title": "Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.", "text": "Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.\n\nAEL Football Club (), also known by its full name Athlitiki Enosi Larissa (), simply called AEL or Larissa, is a Greek professional football club based in the city of Larissa, capital of Greece's Thessaly region.\n\nFounded in 1964, it is directly associated with the city of Larissa and its representation. The club's emblem, is a rising horse and its colors are crimson and white. It is the only team outside the two major Greek cities (Athens and Thessaloniki) to have won the Greek Championship in the season 1987–88. AEL has also won the Greek Cup twice (1984–85 and 2006–07) and came runners-up in the Cup finals of 1982 and 1984. This record places the club among the top teams in the history of Greek football.\n\nThey play their home games at AEL FC Arena, a newly built stadium (2010) with a capacity of 16,118 seats. The team currently competes in the Greek Super League, the first tier of the Greek football league system.\n\nAthletic Union of Larissa, The \"Queen of Thessaly\", the \"Queen of the lowlands\". AEL, is the club that represents one of the greatest Greek football prefectures. One Championship, two cups, four finals and many important successes at European level compose the temporal profile of the top team of the Greek region.\n\nAEL was created from a vision of a powerful team that will represent a city like Larisa in the top category. The 17 May 1964, is referred to as the exact date of its establishment, and then – after a barrage of meetings and discussions – held at the Municipal Conservatory of Larissa and a catalytic last meeting of the local county clubs, it was decided the merger of Iraklis Larissa, \"Aris\", \"Toxotis\" and \"Larissaikos\". The Athletic Union of Larissa was now a reality, designed on the background of the Second Division, in shades of crimson and white, (not black and white, as initially decided) ... Typically, the conversion of the statute of Iraklis Larissa just a few days later – on 22 May – and its adoption on 8 June, gave AEL status, while teams \"Dimitra\", \"Doxa Emporoipalilon\" (based on \"Aris Larissas\" and \"Doxa\"), \"Pelasgiotida\" (by \"Larissaikos\" and \"Pelasgikos\") and \"Olympos\" (based on \"Toxotis\" and \"Panthessalikos\") completed this football family. On 7 June, Alcazar Stadium, the team's first home ground, recorded the initial friendly game, against Panionios who -by that time- was a very strong team, winning 2–1. Yugoslavian \"Alexander Petrovic\", was the first foreign coach that was hired to ensure the impartiality of the team lineup. Thus, names of players like \"Zampas\", \"Karelias\", \"Kyriakos\", \"Lellis\", \"Papazoglou\", \"Kassas\", \"Saltapidas\", \"Delfos\", \"Katsianis\" and many others, passed into the history of thessalian football. Everything was ready to start, under the administrative umbrella of a 15-member ecumenical council, composed of representatives of clubs and organizations of the city, in which the property was held by the former president of Iraklis Larissa, \"K. Tzovaridis\".\n\nExamples of other Greek areas where mergers and establishment of strong teams brought directly impact and a promotion in the 1st Division, has created in advance an optimism which, did not materialize. At least, not directly. The team ends the season 1964–65 in the 5th place. The next year claimed the promotion again, improving however by two seats in the final table. The promotion was lost in a game on 8 May 1966 at Megara with the home side Vyzas opponent. During the entry of the team on the field, player Dimitrios Zambas was hit in the head by a ladder thrown from the stands and was taken to the hospital. The team with 10 players due to the elimination of Kyriakidis from the first quarter, and with 3 of the 10 remaining players injured, had formal presence, and was defeated 6–0). Disappointment was soon made its appearance...Αlthough well-known coaches like \"Dionysis Minardos\", \"Giannis Helmis\" and \"Giourkas Seitaridis\" the first, passed of the \"steering wheel\" of the team, the downturn seemed certain, leading in 1969 with mathematical precision, in the tail of the table...The relegation would be inevitable if the political conditions of the time – Greek military junta of 1967–1974 – and the fact that teams headed by powerful men were in the same predicament, brought changes in the status of Greek football.. Therefore, Kostas Aslanidis, Lieutenant Colonel and the Secretary General of Athletics, increased the 2 groups of the Second Division to 3 and thus AEL, Chania and Ionikos continued in the B' National. In Fact, there was a rationalization of the Second Division, by creating three groups of 16 teams, of which 15 will be relegated (5 of each group) in the 3rd Division. But the effort was left unfinished. Because, ultimately there has been no relegation and it was decided the next season each group to have 18 teams. Otherwise, like the previous season, the winners of groups (three this time) went to the final phase, which claimed the promotion in the 1st Division. The team indeed, with the entrance to the 1970s, the emergence of the administrative forefront of \"Kantonias\" family (the owner of BIOKARPET Group) and a dramatic changing at liveware, managed to change the status. The coming of some experienced players such as \"Simantiris\", \"Kyziroglou\", \"Charitidis\" and \"Nikiforakis\" framed the talented \"Lakis Pagkarliotas\" and the others...\n\n25–06–1972 : It was the last game of the championship of the Second Division. AEL needed the victory to celebrate the promotion in the First National (the team had 95 points while opponent Panserraikos had 96 and only the first of the group would promote). In the Serres Municipal Stadium that day (which holds the all-time attendance record with 14,200 tickets) except the locals, also existed around 5000 guest fans from Larissa.\nNevertheless, AEL managed to precede with 0–1 but Panserraikos equalized with a disputed penalty.\nSoon riots appeared between the players on the court and generalized at the end of the match between the fans (final result 1–1). The next day, thousands citizens of Larissa were gathered and resentful of the injustice marched to the central square of the city. The demonstration took the character of an \"anti-junta\" movement. One of the few mass events that were made in Greece before the events of Athens Polytechnic. Two days later AEL submitted an objection for the improper use of the player of Panserraikos \"Stefanidis\". The Regulations Committee EPO upheld the complaint because Panserraikos did not pay the fine of 250 Drachmas for the penalty. On 30 June, the same committee in another meeting and after the intervention of Colonel Aslanidis (himself originating from Serres), dismissed the objection of AEL and promoted Panserraikos to the 1st National.\n\nAEL lineup in that match:\n\"Siavalas\", \"Buttos\", \"Simantiris\", \"Kyziroglou\", \"Lellis\", (63' \"Makris\"), \"Nikiforakis\", (50' \"Zachos\"), \"Charitidis\", \"Argiroulis\", \"Stergiadis\", \"Seitaridis\", \"Gkountelitsas\"..Εventually, what failed then to fulfil the team of Kostas Polychroniou, became reality one year later by the team of \"Stefan Karamfilovic\".\n\nA season that was started with President \"Antonios Kantonias\", continued with \"Michalis Kittas\" and ended up headed by Mayor \"Messinis\", was to be the top – until then – for the \"crimsons\" who rejoiced in the finale closing, the coveted promotion. It was the year that \"Horacio Morales\", \"Daniel Hill\", \"Giorgio Vajeho\", \"Guillermo Daus\" and \"Enrique Cavoli\" flew from Argentina and \"landed\" at Alcazar. Just months earlier they had played with the colors of Independiente against AC Milan in the Intercontinental Cup. On 23 June 1973, AEL wins Kallithea 3–0 and seal typically the promotion in the First National, finishing first with 98 points, ahead of the second renaissance Karditsa who finished with 89 points. The goals for AEL succeed by \"Pagkarliotas\" at 16', \"D. Seitaridis\" at 38' and \"Charitidis\" at 80'. AEL lined up on the field with the following players: \"Siavalas\", \"Simantiris\", \"Seitaridis M.\", \"Hill\", \"Kyziroglou\", \"Boutos\", \"Charitidis\", \"Cavoli\", \"Rakintzoglou\", \"Seitaridis\" and \"Pagkarliotas\".. The team started the season 1973–74 at the First National, with the enthusiasm of a rookie, but clearly capable of material, grafted by the talent and quality players like \"Kyriakidis\", Matzourakis and \"Dramalis\" in order to stay in the category. The course was based on the overall strength of the home ground and the final 9th position was considered highly successful. \"Karamfilovic\" was replaced (due to expired residence to the country that was not renewed for political reasons), by the Bulgarian coach \"Ivan Kochev\". However, a team built on legionnaires without first having obtained the financial strength and solid basis, couldn't have long term evolution. So, the very next year problems started, which led to hasty choices, judgments and frequent upheavals in all levels. Inevitably therefore, the team didn't avoided the relegation and on summer of '75 returned to the Second Division. Since an immediate return was considered impossible, the rebuilding of the team began slowly, mainly based in local Larissa's area players. More experienced \"Siavalas\", \"Boutos\", \"Lellis\", \"Stergiadis\", and \"Argiroulis\" formed the backbone on which, as time went on, had positive impact for the team. Of course, the great breakthrough was made a year later by President \"Elias Kelesidis\" and his colleagues in the administration, when they decided to promote to the first team all of the youth squad of AEL, and collect all the talents that admittedly stood well in the Thessalian prefecture. Thus, on 26 May 1977, in a friendly match against AEK (the first under spotlights in Alcazar stadium), AEL lined up with \"Anagnostou\", \"Mousouris\" and 9 native players from Larissa's region. Among them, unknown then, Takis Parafestas, Giannis Valaoras, Dimitris Koukoulitsios and \"Christos Andreoudis\"...It was indisputably a healthy set of factors and players, which united the common goal and vision of the entire city, to create a \"model-team\". That summer of '77, rookies including Dimitris Mousiaris and Giannis Valaoras where dressed in crimson and signed a professional contract... These two, along with Koukoulitsios and \"Ilias Selionis\" didn't take long to become members of the youth National teams.\nOn 18 June 1978 AEL traveled in Thessaloniki, and celebrated on the pitch of Nea Efkarpia a great victory against Macedonikos (4–1), finishing first with 59 points ahead of Olympiakos Volos, who eventually collected 57 points, while ensured the return in the major league of Greek football as the champion of the Northern Group of Second Division. Koukoulitsios scored the goals for AEL at 17' and 60', Valaoras at 31' and \"Liapis\" at 87'. AEL lined up on the field with the following players: \"Bountolos\", Parafestas, \"Selionis\", \"Dramalis\", \"Argiroulis\", \"Koumarias\" (63' Koukoulitsios), \"Andreoudis\", \"Liapis\", Mousiaris, Valaoras (61' \"Rammos\").. The period 1977–78, completed the work of the previous season when AEL had finished in the third place with 46 points. The balanced combination of experienced and talented players managed to create a strong team that succeeded in gaining the promotion. AEL returned to the First National and now, the solid foundations on which founded this football building, guaranteed a 15-year establishment and recognition that followed.\n\nThe successful policy of carefully selected few experienced and many talented young players continued and AEL not only threatened, but started slowly building a bright future, often achieving results that showed that something big was coming up. However, the same policy maintained by all administrations in the 80s, with proper and prudent management of its human material, gradually cultivated by coaches like Yugoslavian \"Milan Ribar\", and later Kostas Polychroniou and Antonis Georgiadis. Even though some players selectively exited the team, it was certain that there was an equal replacement. So while the team has changed almost everything from the beginning to the end of the decade, in the conscience of the fans it has remained as one and single season. It was the era of AEL or better AEL FC, since in the summer of 1979 it was decided the organization of Greek football on a professional basis. The late \"Antonios Kantonias\", raising the prestige and power of the group \"BIOKARPET\" was the one who managed to secure the independence of the club, with exemplary organization and a very clear strategy : The aim to reach to the top. Healthy reasons did not allowed him to continue as President of the Interim Committee and the chair of the first administration, and was finally replaced by \"Simos Palaiochorlidis\". But he had already managed to complete his mission.\n\nUnfortunately, the evidence of the power of competitive and organizational work that was achieved in AEL, came up with the most tragic way. It was 6 September 1979, when Dimitris Koukoulitsios and Dimitris Mousiaris, were killed in a car crash near Thiva, on their way to Athens for a training with the U-21 National team. Yet still no one has forgotten them, perhaps because the third of the \"company\" cared about it. Giannis Valaoras, who had survived the accident and overcame the shock, has been one of the greatest members of the team of the 80's..\n\nWith a stable administration, new faces on the roster, Maloumidis, Galitsios, \"Golandas\" and gradually Voutyritsas and Mitsibonas and with the advent of the technical leadership of Antonis Georgiadis, AEL was beginning to show its \"teeth\"..\nBest Regional team for the 1980–81 season, AEL claimed the European exit in the final league game...Participation in the Greek Cup final in the summer of '82, for the first time in its history, and a 1–0 defeat by Panathinaikos in the Nea Philadelfeia stadium. The \"greens\" succeeded to the finals before the end of the championship and the barrage against Olympiakos, in the neutral Volos, having the certainty that it would provide them in advance the Cup.. On that historic first final that was held on 19 June 1982, AEL lined up with the following players: Plitsis, Parafestas, Patsiavouras, Galitsios, \"Argiroulis\", \"Dramalis\" (82' Voutyritsas) Maloumidis, \"Golantas\", \"Koutas\" (82' Mitsibonas) \"Andreoudis\", Valaoras. The \"crimsons\" did not intimidated.. The next season (1982–83) they came to claim even the title after a great victory in the second round at the Karaiskaki Stadium derby against Olympiakos. Eventually, the second place constituted the ultimate fulfillment for Jacek Gmoch's players, who had been under strong denial because of the modest beginning of the team in the first round of the championship.\n\nThe legacy left by that season in living material, was a defender named Giorgos Mitsibonas, one forward in the person of Michalis Ziogas, (a player who knew as much as anyone else to be at the right time and in the right place) and of course a \"coach on the field\", which was none other than the Polish international, Kazimierz Kmiecik.\nThe team of '82–83 season yielded modern, fast and sophisticated football and fairly won the nickname \"Small Hamburg\", taken by the great German team of the 80's..The first exit in Europe was a rewarding and meaningful vindication of an effort that lasted several years, even though AEL ultimately failed to overcome the obstacle of the – very strong then – Hungarian Honvéd.\n\nAustrian coach Walter Skocik had found a good, technical but somewhat tired team. And even if they didn't show steady progress in the league, they managed to be in another Cup Final. Opponent on 6 June 1984, Panathinaikos again, this time in the Athens Olympic Stadium, which was also used by the \"greens\" as home ground. This fact, coupled with the modest appearance of AEL, apparently justified by the intensity of the semi-final battle against Iraklis, (which took place just 3 days earlier!) and the loss of the suspended Valaoras, brought normal|y a 2–0 defeat, leaving AEL bitterness, which diminished by the ticket for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, once Panathinaikos had won the double.\nThe next season, president \"Kostas Samaras\" and coach Andrzej Strejlau (who brought with him from Poland another great player, named Krzysztof Adamczyk), were very optimistic about the team's course. Indeed, its participation in the Cup Winners' Cup for the period 1984–85 was impressive and established the name of the Thessalian team in the European football map. The \"crimsons\" came up to the \"8\", where they have been excluded after two sensational quarter-finals by the Soviets of Dynamo Moscow. The unique, however, distinguish in the institution of the Cup Winners Cup that season, made a big impression and showed how great this team was and capable for even bigger achievements...This team however, – that many believed was playing the best football in Greece by that time – was unstoppable and determined to finally overcome and get to a title. This title was not the championship, (although succeeded a record for best offensive productivity in the season), but the Greek Cup, the final of which AEL qualified for the third time.\n\nThe final against the 1985 champion PAOK, has been recorded as one of the top performances in the history of AEL. The \"crimsons\" played \"total\" football, smashed with 4–1 their opponents and eventually came to their first title. However, in the pregame of that fight a common point united the two teams...AEL and PAOK lined up before the referee Makis Germanakos without their two key players (left back Nikos Patsiavouras and top scorer Christos Dimopoulos), since they both had already agreed to sign for Panathinaikos! As for the actual game, on 22 June 1985, on the Athens Olympic Stadium before 30,000 shared fans, AEL seemed to have the upper hand from the start, but completely dominated from the 19', when Vassilakos was expelled by direct red card (hit Adamczyk off-phase) and reached its first goal at 39' with Ziogas, after an incredible attempt of the Polish striker. After the second half κick-off Kmiecik wrote with perfect shot the 2–0 and although PAOK reduced to 55' with Skartados, Andrzej Strejlau's players finished the game at 73' with Ziogas and 75' with Valaoras, teaching modern football while creating a host of missed opportunities. The players who led AEL in its first title in its history were: Plitsis, Parafestas, Kolomitrousis, Galitsios, Mitsibonas, Voutiritsas, Ziogas, Kmiecik, Adamczyk, Andreoudis (87' Tsiolis) Valaoras.\nThe first trophy that was raised in the sky of Athens the previous evening by the team captain Takis Parafestas was entered the city the next day escorted by hundreds of cars.\n\nAmbitious battles were waiting for AEL in Europe, but failed to proceed, against the famous Italian Sampdoria. Maybe tired, perhaps it still cost them so much the leaving of their \"conductor\", the beloved Kazio for the Stuttgart Kickers... His compatriot Janusz Kupcewicz, who replaced him, although came right from the best lineup of the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, had injury problems and did not help as much as he could..At that time, the culmination of a transfer thriller, a player who was acquired by Toxotis Larissa and dressed in crimson, making his first professional steps and later called \"the magician\", Vassilis Karapialis. His own introduction, along with two to three other important events, painted the following year, the most indifferent season for AEL that decade. The assumption of command by Stelios Kantonias and the return of Jacek Gmoch in the technical leadership, were guarantees for the great offensive of the new season. No paint, but it was stronger than the black of mourning, which darkened the sky of Larissa. 19 years old Vasilis Theodoridis, a PAOK supporter, an hour before the match hurled a fishing flare against the local fans stands which hit the unsuspecting Charalambos Blionas in the carotid arteries. The unfortunate professor died seconds later. That day, on 26 October 1986, a grievous page was written in the history of Greek football and as though nothing is more important than the loss of a life, unequivocally just one year later, the city of Larissa has experienced glorious times. The only team in the Greek region who ever sat on the throne.\n\nStill, the road ahead was not a bed of roses...The non-renewal of contracts of Parafestas and \"Andreoudis\" in the summer and the transfer of Plitsis to Olympiakos in December, were options that were not accepted by the fans, but the success of the team in conjunction with the \"rising star\" of Karapialis, minimized any opposition disposal. Especially when on 16 March 1988 the sports court announced the decision to remove 4 points from AEL because of the famous \"doping case\" of the Bulgarian striker (with very little participation in the championship), Georgi Tsingov. He was tested positive on the use of the substance Codeine, which is not likely to improve the performance of an athlete at all.. Conspiracy theories quoted around about what really happened, the player claimed that had a flu, others that it was a sabotage. Nevertheless, the whole city of Larissa rose up and in no time created road blocks that cut Greece in two, claiming the right of what the team had won over the football field. The barricades on the national highway lasted 5 whole days until an intervention by the political leadership of sports. They took the decision to restore order, and change the article in question. From 21 March 1988, teams ceased to be considered responsible for each possible doping athlete. AEL however, was largely responsible for the... psychological doping of the fans, which then helped to overcome doubt and anxiety and get proudly in the 87th minute of the penultimate game of the season against Iraklis, when that incredible shot of Mitsibonas hurled into space the enthusiasm of the crowd. So far, AEL is the first and only regional team that won the Greek championship.\n\nSomewhere there the countdown began ...AEL was knocked hill, reached the top and had to start to go downhill...The circle of a large team had closed. Maybe if Xamax had not turned the match at Neuchâtel and not sent by 2–1 in the overtime and the unlucky for the \"crimsons\" penalty shootout, Champions League would held the name of AEL in its ledger, where reigns the amazing goal of Karapialis which opened the score on the second leg of Switzerland. This was the last presence for AEL in the most prestigious club competition in European football. The fans still believed that the team could stay in the spotlight. The accident was for those who were blurred by the excitement of the moment, and believed that the team could climb even higher and soon demanded the change of ownership. From there, players leaving and coming, administrations changed without programming, independently on the intentions of everyone.. The fact is that AEL gradually lost its credibility inside and outside stadiums and inevitably led eight years later, in May 1996, to the relegation which was spared in 1991, thanks to the amazing second round course. More generally, although great players such as late Lefter Millos, also unjustly shed, Ştefan Stoica, Paulo Da Silva, David Embé and Vangelis Tsoukalis, wore the shirt and tried to give the team its lost glory, failed nothing more than some effects – flickering, in a prescribed downward spiral that culminated with the painful return to the Second Division after 18 years.\n\nWorst of all, however, occurred on 13 September 1997, when the \"eagle stopped flying\". Giorgos Mitsibonas, the player-symbol of the team, the gifted and talented figure that marked a glorious era, was killed in a car accident, near the village of Giannouli, 2 km outside of Larissa. He was only thirty five and left behind his wife and his two young daughters.. Even if he was not by that time an active player of the team, (he was playing in Tirnavos), the whole city said farewell along with him, to a large part of its passion for distinction and victory. The conscientious efforts of local factors to keep the club standing were unsuccessful, the debts piled in between, and no one was able by this time, in the summer of 2001, to save the team... AEL fell for the first time in its history in the Third Division, and even threatened with disintegration, with relegation to the Regional Championship, and had to get to the bottom to lift its head again, taking advantage of the beneficial law of special clearance...\n\nSummer of 2002 : AEL arrives at the worst point in its history. Playing again in the third national, almost without administration and money. The team's preparation for the new season was held in the local Alcazar Park (a place with rustic picnic areas, benches and trails, totally unsuitable for professional football training), near the city of Larissa. The first game was held on 25 August 2002 in Kalochori, Thessaloniki, against the local side ILTEX Lykoi. It was the 84th minute of the match, when the 2nd Assistant referee fell down after he was hit in the back, by an object that was thrown from the stands of the guest fans and was taken to the hospital. He claimed that he was unable to continue and the game never finished (The result was 1–1). The team was penalized with −3 points in the league table.. Amateur players and volunteers were called to offer their services.. The course was naturally very poor and the team risked with the relegation to the 4th National.. Halfway through the season appeared on the scene the name of Nikos Sotiroulis, a local businessman who by that time was the club's one and only sponsor. Along with the unforgettable friend, the late Giorgos Katsogiannis and supporting factors of Amateur AEL predominantly Elias Fasoulas and Zissis Helidonis, he fought the first negative judgments and vindicated, when on 8 March 2003 he became the owner of the team with a cost of 116,000 euros in an auction that was held the previous day and in which he was the only candidate! The club a year later, was renamed to AEL 1964 FC (Under the special conditions imposed by the law of special clearance) and celebrated its return to the second division. Some months before, on 1 June 2003, the team survived the relegation in the Fourth National and thereby dissolve, in the last game of the championship against Niki Volos, winning 1–0. Although, the most crucial and exciting match in the team's -stone years- history was the one before, that was held in Chania, where the \"crimsons\" tie 3–3 and stayed alive, condemning the hosts. The new period started then vigorously and with one and only target, the promotion, which was achieved after an exhausting marathon of 38 games...On 30 May 2004, at Alcazar, AEL sealed the second place and the ticket to the higher category (which was virtually and \"ironically\" ensured by the victory from 1–0 at ILTEX Lykoi just a week before, in the same ground and almost two years after the incident with the Assistant referee), crashing with 5–1 the already \"doomed\" Pontiakos Nea Santa, while the chant \"We are coming back\" was rocking the crowded stadium... Coached by Takis Parafestas, with players such as \"Katsaras\", \"Ziagkas\", Kyparissis, Kehagias, \"Theodosiadis\", Kontodimos, Lazorik, Paleologos, and a new upsurge of the fans that followed everywhere, the team persuaded that was really coming back ... The one who left, and was the initiator and founder of this effort was \"Nikos Sotiroulis\", who after a few days in mid-June 2004, gave way to the new owner and chairman Kostas Piladakis. A new era had begun.\n\nAnd because a \"good day seems from the morning\", new management, technical leadership headed by Giorgos Donis, players like the effective striker Thomas Kyparissis and the presence of supporters that caused admiration through Greece, led AEL back again in the Super League, after nine years of absence. The 19 transfers that were made in the summer of 2004 radically changed the composition of the workforce and the equally young and ambitious coach had time to give the team the required homogeneity. The moderate so start treated by all with patience and maturity, and the proper corrections that were made in January, found AEL \"galloping\" from success to success. The conquest of the first place with 58 points was the natural consequence of this team effort and the fans celebrated the return in the Super League after 9 \"stone\" years, for almost 10 days! Starting from Sunday 15, of May 2005, in Kastoria, (1–1) in front of 4,000 fans who accompanied the team's bus when returning, a car convoy of 5 km in length and a midnight party at Alcazar, to Wednesday 25, and the fiesta that was set up to the stadium for winning the title after beating Proodeftiki (3–1). Except Kyparissis, \"Papakostas\", \"Ziagkas\", Paleologos, \"Floros\" and \"Grigoriou\", who continued from the previous season, players such as Christopoulos, Kipouros, the late Bahramis, \"Gikas\", \"Stournaras\", Föerster, Katsiaros, Digozis, \"Tsiatsios\", \"Makris\", Abouna, Nedeljković, Sisic, \"Passios\", \"Chatziliontas\", Galitsios and others, came to add their names to important pages in the team's history. Indeed, beside them, stood from summer until December 2004 the first Greek active scorer Alexis Alexandris and a well-known name in European football, the Romanian international midfielder Dennis Şerban, who played in many major teams, top of which was the Spanish Valencia. That same season, while in the 2nd Division, AEL reached to the \"8\" of the Greek Cup, having ruled in turn Acharnaikos, Apollon Athens, and Chalkidona of the First Division, before being excluded from the \"European\" Skoda Xanthi, which nevertheless beat 1–0 in the first match of Alcazar, turning the rematch in real derby. It was the forerunner of the great return.\n\nIn the first year after its return to the big category AEL did the \"bang\" bringing in the summer of 2005 directly from the English courts the UEFA Euro 2004 champion and former captain of the Greek national football team, Nikos Dabizas. A move that was made to shield the defense while sending the message that AEL did not returned to Super League just to remain, but to star. Along with AEL returned also its supporters, giving impressive \"presence\" with tours admired throughout Greece. Toumba, Kaftanzoglio, Pankritio, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Zosimades...Comfortably stayed 8th, and a European opportunity occurred through Intertoto Cup, exploiting the weakness of PAOK to fulfill the criteria of UEFA. A European return, with two games against the Turkish Kayserispor did not bring the coveted Cup Qualification to UEFA Cup (within 0–0 draw, and a 2–0 defeat in Kayseri), but it was clearly an omen of a great European return, which was meant to be completed one year later. The 2006–07 season was one of its most successful, but also one of the most controversial in the club's modern history. On the one AEL rose again to the throne of Greek Cup Winners, and on the other flirted with relegation, eventually managing to secure salvation in the last matchday.\n\n5 May 2007 is now a new landmark in the history of AEL 1964. Giorgos Donis and his players brought the Cup \"again in Pineios\" after 22 years, creating a new benchmark in the glorious march of the team. This is the final certificate that AEL returned to the elite of Greek football. Cup in 1985, the 1988 Championship, and a Cup again in 2007 in Volos where the game's MVP Nikos Dabizas and the vice captain, \"Zissis Ziagkas\" lifted together the third major trophy in the team's history. Opponents again Panathinaikos for the third time in a cup final where the \"crimsons\" prevailed with 1–2. The match was held in the Panthessaliko Stadium, inside Thessalian \"territory\". AEL secured beside all other the European participation for the second consecutive year, this time in the UEFA Cup. Jozef Kožlej and Henry Antchouet, took the baton from Ziogas, Kmiecik and Valaoras, signing with their own goals – (who had the stamp of Giorgos Fotakis) – this new \"golden\" page. The Slovakian striker opened the scoring in just the third minute with a perfect header following a free kick from Fotakis, Papadopoulos equalized with a penalty won by Föerster and masterfully executed in the 44th, however, Antchouet was the player who held the final. In the 83rd minute the \"Gabonese Arrow\" poured on the offensive after the exemplary deep ball of Fotakis and \"thundered\" the goalkeeper Ebéde, writing the 1–2 that was meant to be the final score. The final whistle of Kyros Vassaras found over 10,000 fans of the team ecstatic singing \"because we have lost our minds, this Cup is ours\", giving rise to frantic celebration. The celebration began at Panthessaliko from the award of the precious trophy, continued to Alcazar who opened its gates to welcome the winners and ended in the Central Square of Larissa shortly after midnight.\n\nAEL 1964 (Donis): Kotsolis, Galitsios, Venetidis, Dabizas, Föerster, Bassila, Silva Cleyton (85 ' Vallas) Digozis, Aloneftis (74 ' Kalantzis), Fotakis, Kožlej, (60 'Antchouet).\n\nPanathinaikos (Muñoz): Ebéde, Vyntra, Nilsson, (84 ' Šerić), Goumas, Morris, Leontiou, Tziolis (85 ' Bišćan), Ninis (73 ' Romero), Ivanschitz, Papadopoulos, Mantzios.\n\nA week later the \"crimsons\" made the trip from Heaven to Hell and Heaven again within a 90-minute to ensure in the 81st minute with an Own goal the victory in Kalamaria with 2–1 against the local Apollon, having at their side to support over 3,000 fans and putting \"happy endings\" in a difficult and successful year.\n\nThe new season started with the best omens. AEL as the Cup Winner, represented Greece in the UEFA Cup and the draw brought its technical leader, Giorgos Donis, faced with the club in which he started his international football career, English Blackburn Rovers. AEL entered the first qualifying round as the clear underdog, but in the afternoon of 20 September 2007 at the Panthessaliko Stadium – after Alcazar did not complied to the UEFA specifications – radically subverted the data: won 2–0 in the first match and losing 2–1 in the second game of Ewood Park and took a proud qualification to the group stage. In the \"32\" AEL faced powerful teams like Everton with a long tradition in the Premier League, rising Dutch AZ Alkmaar, German Nürnberg and the subsequent 2008 UEFA Cup winners mighty Russian Zenit Saint Petersburg. The team failed to pick a point in the four games, but won the respect that was confirmed by great European coaches, which AEL found opposite in this journey as Louis van Gaal and Dick Advocaat. Liberated from the burden of European obligations and with the assistance of world class players like Maciej Żurawski and Tümer Metin – AEL made an excellent championship course in the second round of the Super League and lost by one goal tie with Panionios the 5th position that led to the playoffs. A bittersweet epilogue to one of the most successful season in the team's history. Confirming the ever upward steps at all levels AEL recorded in 2008–09 one of the most successful years in its modern history. Stayed for 13 consecutive undefeated matches, finished 5th in the Super League and ensured its entry into the play-offs and a European output (in the UEFA Europa League) for the third time in the last 4 years and for just the third time in its history through the championship. It is a year in which AEL – among other things – broke two traditions winning in Kaftanzoglio Iraklis for the first time since 1982 and Olympiacos in Karaiskakis Stadium after 26 years\n\nFrom that point the countdown started again, which two years later brought back AEL in the second division. Wrong assessments and decisions regarding the completion of the team roster, and the leaving of the players who provided the guarantee of a remarkable and steady racing body, but much more decisive was the relentless chase of the team on the part of arbitration.\nThe European exclusion from the weak Icelandic KR Reykjavík\nbecause of – mainly – the poor squad and preparation in the summer of 2009 brought the first clouds. The unexpected death of the late Mexican striker Antonio de Nigris on 16 November marked with indelible black lettering that period, in which AEL has managed to keep its position in the penultimate game of the season, changing coach (Giannis Papakostas in place of Marinos Ouzounidis) and achieving 5 wins in the last 7 games of the season. The prospect of the entry into the new stadium (the AEL FC Arena) and the feeling that the near-mishap last season had taught a lesson, created expectations of great things for the 2010–11 season, accompanied by large investments in player transfers. The transition from the historic Alcazar Stadium into the newly built AEL FC Arena in late November – early December 2010, was not made in the way that every fan had hoped and dreamed of. Two defeats by Panionios, (0–1) and PAOK (1–2), spoiled the festive atmosphere, but above all it was the shadow of arbitration that created a bleak future again. Grossly injusticed over the first half of the season (for nearly 13 games!) with catalytic decisions that shaped scores and results, AEL had an unequal fight until the end – changing coaching and trying to strengthen the squad but finally relented. Even the most pessimistic would hardly imagine at the beginning of that year that AEL in a new stadium and with star-players (Dabizas, Venetidis, Cousin, Canobbio, Metin, Tavlaridis Čontofalský, Pancrate) would finish in the penultimate position and eventually relegate. But the harsh reality was obliging the \"crimsons\" in a new Calvary, for which were not themselves responsible, at least not entirely. The revelation of the match fixing scandal that occurred in the early summer of 2011 was only moral justification for the club and nothing more. After a barrage of outright decisions and scandalous implementation of sports legislation by the \"Professional Sports Committee\" and the Hellenic Football Federation, with selective application of regulations that was completed after almost six months(!) in October, the club remained in the Football League.\n\nAfter the club's relegation and a final attempt to vindicate without much effort, Piladakis began building the team that would return immediately in the Super League. He hired the experienced and reputable coach in the English grounds Chris Coleman and along with him players of International range like Zequinha, the famous Portuguese midfielder Luís Boa Morte, the Brazilian winger Césinha and many others. The course of the team in the 2011–12 season started with the best omens, but soon all would be reversed. Financial problems that piled, appeared again and eventually led the coach and many of the players to the exit. Rupture between the owner and the organized fans substantially undermined the future of the team. Piladakis resigned and the club without any administration and financial support, deliberately relegated in the 3rd Division. A move that is used by many football teams in Greece and was based in a financial law (special clearance), made to ensure the deletion of the previous debts, as teams that competing in the 3rd Category are considered amateur. In the summer of 2013, Evangelos Plexidas, a local businessman from Trikala took over and promised immediate return. Although the team indeed promoted relatively easily from the 3rd category and also won the Greek 3rd Category Cup, and the 2013–14 Amateurs' Super Cup many incorrect choices about the team's administration and management were not accepted by the fans. The changing of 6 coaches in a single season (2014–15) and the leaving of almost 15 players (although the team managed to participate in the Football League Play-Offs but failed to promote), created again a poor situation that led the major shareholder in the decision to sell the majority stake of his shares to Alexis Kougias, a well-known Greek lawyer and football administrator in July 2015. A year later, on 15 May 2016, the team finally gained the promotion into the Super League. In clear contrast with the last time, however, there was little enthusiasm among the fans, as Kougias had longtime conflicts with them as well as the local community and veterans of the team. The first season back in top flight was a difficult one, with 3 managers employed : Sakis Tsiolis left almost immediately after the club's promotion on June 2, 2016 only to return 5 months later and replace Angelos Anastasiadis who took over after him the previous summer. He managed to keep his place on the bench until March 21, 2017 when he resigned for personal reasons. Thus, despite relative financial stability the team struggled on and off the pitch, yet managed to keep its top flight status by finishing 13th, just above the relegation places. After 1 match coached by caretaker Theodoros Voutiritsas, Alexis Kougias hired the Dutch André Paus, that managed to stay for 7 games in the club's bench. On September 14, 2017, Belgian manager Jacky Mathijssen was announced and signed for the rest of the season. Despite that, 11 Days later and after only 3 games (0–0 home draw with Atromitos a 4–1 away loss against Panionios and a 2–0 loss against Panathinaikos for the Greek Cup) he was fired. Ilias Fyntanis, the club's previous assistant coach returned as a caretaker and Kougias hired the 3rd manager for the ongoing season, Apostolos Mantzios. A day later, Mantzios announced that due to serious personal reasons he cannot take over. Ilias Fyntanis took over as the club's manager, and succeeded to make the team showing a more stable performance. Despite that, on February 20, 2018, he was fired once again and was replaced by the Serbian Ratko Dostanić that had coached the team in the season 2015–16 in the Football League. Ηowever, this new deal did not last for long. In Fact, only 3 games later, Dostanić resigned after a serious disagreement with the club's owner. Kougias hired the 42 years old Sotiris Antoniou, himself originating from Agia, Larissa. He made his Super League managerial debut on April 1, 2018 on a 3–0 away defeat against Apollon Smyrnis. The team showed little improvement in the league but still avoided relegation relatively easily. They were also very close to qualification for the club's fifth cup final, but a last-minute goal for semifinal opponents AEK Athens send them through instead on the away goals rule.\n\n\n\nThe emblem of the club is a wild rising horse (same as the symbol of the city), believed to be an ancient thessalian-breed horse like Alexander the Great's Bucephalus.\n\nThe team's colours have been crimson and white since the formation of the club in 1964.\n\nFirst\n\nAlternative\n\nAEL FC Arena is the home ground of AEL. It is a UEFA 3-star rated stadium and has a seating capacity of 16,118 all covered. As well as functioning as a football stadium, Arena also operates as a conference centre and music venue. Actual construction of the stadium lasted 14 months, beginning in September 2009 and ended in late November 2010. From May 2013 until September 2015, the team played its home games in the old Alcazar Stadium, due to economic disputes concerning the rent of the stadium between the owning company (\"Gipedo Larissa AE\") and the precedent chairman, \"Evangelos Plexidas\". On 22 July 2015, the club's new major shareholder Alexis Kougias, promised in an interview that the team will return and compete for the season 2015–16 in the Arena. Indeed, on 26 August 2015, there was an agreement and an official announcement of the new season's tickets for the stadium. Since then, the team competes in AEL FC Arena.\n\nAEL has its own training facilities in the area of the village Dendra, near to the town of Tyrnavos. Those facilities cover over 30,000 square meters, have multisport purposes for all of the team's athletes and among the others include:\n\nMonsters is the largest AEL FC supporters club. The first attempt to organise the team's supporters was made on 31 March 1982 during the game against Diagoras 30 fans that belonged to the older but old-fashioned club Ierolochites gathered in the Gate D of the old Alcazar Stadium that was meant to be the legendary \"Gate-1\" afterwards. Monsters club was formed as an idea of having a true and passionate support to the team without restrictions or boundaries.\n\nThe fans tend to use various styles and sizes of banners and flags bearing the name and symbols of their club and have been following the team since the first day everywhere in Greece and Europe.\n\nMonsters have a strong relationship with German team 1.

It is one of the most frequented and best connected transportation hubs in Vienna. The Karlskirche is located here.\n\nThe first district can be reached either by subway (Karlsplatz station) or via Operngasse (a street). The pavilions of the former Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station remain despite the construction of the U-Bahn system.\n\nThe largest area of the square on the south side, Resselpark, is named after the inventor Josef Ressel. To the east is the Karlskirche, located in front of a water pool with a sculpture by Henry Moore with the building of the Vienna Museum (formerly the Historical Museum of Vienna) and the Winterthur Insurance building. On the west side of it is the main building of the Technische Universität Wien (Vienna Technical University) and the Protestant school. In Resselpark, monuments and busts are of famous people such as the inventor Siegfried Marcus and Josef Madersperger, as well as the composer Johannes Brahms. On the north side of the Otto Wagner in Art Nouveau style building erected inclusion of the former station Karlsplatz the Vienna Stadtbahn.\n\nSeparated from the plaza to the north are the buildings of the Wiener Musikverein (Vienna Music Society), the Künstlerhaus (art house), and the Handelsakademie (business school). A Video of the plaza and an eventlist are available on the Website of the association \"karlsplatz.org Verein zur Förderung d. kulturellen Belebung öffentlicher Räume\" .\n\nIn the west limit the Secession and the Novomatic Forum (formerly the Office Building), the place that here in the area of the Naschmarkt passes. Near the library building of the University consists Rosa Mayreder Park with the project space Karlsplatz a branch of the Kunsthalle Wien.\n\nKarlsplatz is one of the most important traffic-points of the city, five different traffic flows form a node here:\n\nBefore the Karlsplatz was built, there was the decorative Elizabeth Era bridge, built in 1854 and named after the young bride of the Emperor (\"Sisi\"). The bridge was fitted in 1867 with still images, which now presides over the City Hall stand. On April 20, 1897, it was blocked and subsequently demolished.\n\nFollowing this, the rescheduling of the bridging of the Vienna River caused long square and fitted with new landmark buildings. On 7 May 1901 the city council established an architectural competition over the new design.\n\nIn the spring of 1903, two dimensional models made and publicly displayed by Otto Wagner to the mayor Karl Lueger. In a press conference on 3 November 1907, he praised Wagner's project, but spoke out against the nature of the Post Office Savings Bank. He then mobilized Princess Pauline Metternich's conservative members of the nobility against the project, the petition within a short 6000 signatures of support received. In January 1910, it came at the Karlsplatz still drawing up a facade segment in Wagner's original size. After the death of Lueger's council decided on 14 July 1911, the establishment of the City Museum on the design - but ultimately this did not come about.\n\nIn the interwar period occurred on the Karlsplatz mainly temporary buildings (such as a shopping center on the site of today's Vienna Museum), after 1945 was dominated by considerations of transport planning (although it did not come to the by George Lippert other and proposed elevated highway solutions). Karlsplatz architectural competitions in question were 1946, 1966, 1969 (relating to underground construction), 1971 (relating to the Garden Making). The realized design with the Swedish garden architect Sven Ingvar Anderson designed oval pond encountered 1976-77 sharpest criticism - Clemens Holzmeister appeared as \"shocked\" over the water surface in front of the Karlskirche, the media spoke of the \"chaos space\". Notwithstanding this very negative press echos the acceptance of significantly increased green space Resselpark (and their pond) today. In the course of 2006 by Jakob Fina redesigned planting of greenery of the Karlsplatz were the Esperanto Park and Park Girardi created.\n\nIn 2004, representatives of the Municipality of Vienna, presented the project \"Karlsplatz Art Space Presented\". The goals were, among other things a redesign of the park in terms of gardening, light and space and routing concept, called an improvement of the traffic situation for pedestrians and cyclists and the promotion of art projects on the Karlsplatz.\n\nFollowing the redesign of the park and the opening of Rosa Mayreder, Girardi and Esperanto Park in 2006, Vienna Holding commissioned a 100% subsidiary of Vienna, with the continuation of the project. On 1 August 2006, the project group karlsplatz.org consisting of Gabriela Hegedüs and Christoph Möderndorfer that since 2004 the organization of literary festivals sound bites in the Museum Quarter are responsible, and Peter Melichar, also implementing.

British Rail described it as the largest railway research complex in the world.\n\nThe RTC centralised most of the technical services provided by the regional Chief Mechanical & Electrical Engineers (CM&EE) to form the Department of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering (DM&EE). In addition, it housed the newly formed British Rail Research Division which reported directly to the Board. The latter is well known for its work on the experimental Advanced Passenger Train (APT-E). At that early stage this was a concept vehicle, and in time the DM&EE applied the new knowledge to existing practice in the design of the High Speed Train (HST), the later prototype APT-P and other high-speed vehicles.\n\nThe Research Division was the first to move into the purpose-built accommodation on London Road. This was formed initially with personnel from other departments around the country, including the Electrical Research Division from Rugby, the Mechanical Engineers Research Section, the Civil Engineering Research Unit (Track Lab), and the Chemical Research Unit, while the Scientific Services Division occupied the former LMS Scientific Research Laboratory building across the road known as Hartley House. The embryo RTC site (mainly Kelvin House and the Research Test Hall) was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in May 1964. Later additional buildings were added: Trent House and Derwent House, the Advanced Projects lab, then Stephenson House, Lathkill House and finally Brunel House.\n\nIn addition to the research employees, the RTC became the headquarters of the DM&EE. This brought together engineers from the regional departments, together with its Drawing Offices, the Testing & Performance Section and the Engineering Development Unit workshop (EDU) from Darlington, the Workshops Division (which later became British Rail Engineering Limited) and it was also home to the Board's Central Purchasing Department. Strange to relate but the layout of equipment within the new workshop was as near as possible the same as the original. Following this came the Plastics Development Unit from Eastleigh, which, among other innovations, was responsible for the design of the High Speed Train's streamlined cabs as well as the prototype Mark 3 coach doors.\n\nWhen research and testing required stretches of real railway line, the Research Division used the Old Dalby Test Track, and at Mickleover in Derby and The High Marnham Test Track, the former LD&ECR from Shirebrook to Tuxford where one of Network Rail's RIDC is located.\n\nAt privatisation, most of the facilities were taken over by commercial railway engineering companies, and it was marketed as the \"rtc Business Park\" renting space to a range of small consultancy firms.\n\nThe only facility which is still used for railway research is the moving-model aerodynamic test facility.\n\nThe former RTC site is used by LORAM to carry out repairs and maintenance on railway vehicles. It was also used by Rampart Carriage & Wagon Services (RC&WS) which went into liquidation in 2013. A large part of the site is used as storage and an operating base by LORAM and Network Rail, whose rolling stock on site forms part of Network Rail testing trains. Usual traction on these trains is either Colas Rail class 37s or class 67s. The New Measurement Train and LORAM C21 Grinding/Rail Profile Trains are also maintained at this facility.\n\n\n"}
