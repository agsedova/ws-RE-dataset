{"id": "2138013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138013", "title": "Jaroslav Drobný", "text": "Jaroslav Drobný\n\nJaroslav Drobný (; 12 October 1921 - 13 September 2001) was a World No. 1 amateur tennis and ice hockey champion. He left Czechoslovakia in 1949 and travelled as an Egyptian citizen before becoming a citizen of the United Kingdom in 1959, where he died in 2001. In 1954, he became the first and, to date, only player with African citizenship to win the Wimbledon Championships (aside from dual citizen Roger Federer, who holds South African citizenship but officially represents only Switzerland in sports).\n\nDrobný began playing tennis at age five and, as a ball-boy, watched world-class players including compatriot Karel Koželuh. He had an excellent swinging left-handed serve and a good forehand. Drobny played in his first Wimbledon Championship in 1938, losing in the first round to Alejandro Russell. After World War II Drobný was good enough to be able to beat Jack Kramer in the fourth round of the 1946 Wimbledon Championship before losing in the semifinals. In 1951 and 1952 he won the French Open, defeating in the final Eric Sturgess and then retaining the title the following year against Frank Sedgman. Drobný was the losing finalist at Wimbledon in both 1949 and 1952 before finally winning it in 1954 by beating Ken Rosewall for the title, the first left-hander to capture Wimbledon since Norman Brookes.\n\nHe won three singles titles at the Italian Championships (1950, 1951 and 1953).\n\nDrobný was ranked World No. 1 in 1954 by Lance Tingay of \"The Daily Telegraph\". He has also won the French Open doubles title in 1948, playing with Lennart Bergelin, and he won the mixed doubles title paired with Patricia Canning Todd at 1948 French Open.\n\nDrobný held the distinction of having competed at Wimbledon under four different national identities. In 1938, at the age of 16, he started for his native Czechoslovakia. A year later, following the German invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, he was officially representing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. After World War II, he started at Wimbledon yet again as Czechoslovak but chose to defect from the communist regime in 1949 – he left Czechoslovakia for good on 11 July 1949.\n\nAfter the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948, Drobný became increasingly dissatisfied with the way the communist propaganda used him for its purposes. At the time, he was Czechoslovakia's most renowned athlete together with the phenomenal long-distance runner Emil Zátopek. Increasingly, it was becoming apparent to Drobný that he was no longer able to travel freely to tournaments and he grew dissatisfied with the new regime. This ultimately resulted in his defection from his native land.\n\nDrobný defected from Czechoslovakia together with a fellow Czech Davis Cup player Vladimír Černík while playing at a tennis tournament in Gstaad, Switzerland on July 27th 1949, after disobeying instructions from the USSR government to not play. \"All I had\", he wrote later, \"was a couple of shirts, the proverbial toothbrush and $50.\" Drobný and Černík were the core of the Czechoslovak Davis Cup team. Twice, the two of them had carried their country to the Davis Cup semifinals, losing to Australia in 1947 and in 1948. Drobný won 37 of his 43 Davis Cup matches.\n\nBecoming stateless, Drobný attempted to gain Swiss, US and Australian papers until finally Egypt offered him citizenship. He represented Egypt at Wimbledon from 1950 through 1959, including his title winning run in 1954. He is the only Egyptian citizen ever to win a Grand Slam tennis tournament. At the time of his Wimbledon win in 1954 Drobný was already living in the United Kingdom but only in his final appearance at Wimbledon in 1960, at the age of 38, did he represent his new homeland Great Britain.\n\nDuring his amateur career, Drobný won over 130 singles titles, and was world ranked in the top 10 from 1946–55. Drobný was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1983. He is the only person to win the rare combination of Wimbledon in tennis and a world championship title in ice hockey.\n\nIn total, Drobný started in Wimbledon 17 times, always sporting his trademark tinted prescription glasses as an old ice hockey injury affected his eyesight. Drobný is the only male tennis player who ever won a Wimbledon singles title while wearing glasses. Billie-Jean King and Martina Navratilova are the only female Wimbledon champions wearing glasses. Arthur Ashe, who was known for playing with spectacles, had switched to contact lenses by the time he won Wimbledon in 1975.\n\nDrobný has won the most clay court titles of any one player (over 90). \n\nFrom 1938 to 1949 Drobný played center in the Czechoslovak ice hockey league. He was a Silver medalist with the Czechoslovak ice hockey team in the 1948 Olympics. In the final match, Czechoslovakia and Canada tied goalless but Canada won the gold medal due to a better overall goal average. Drobný scored 9 goals in 8 games at the Olympics. Jaroslav Drobný was also a member of the Czechoslovak national ice hockey team which won the gold medals at the 1947 World Ice Hockey Championships in Prague. He scored 15 goals in 7 games in the tournament including a hat-trick in the decisive victory over USA which gave his country its first ever World Championships title. In 1997, Drobný was inducted in the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Hall of Fame.\nDrobný could have become the first ever European player to start in the National Hockey League when the Boston Bruins put him on their reserve in 1949. Apparently, he was offered $20,000 to come over to play for Boston but he refused, preferring to remain playing amateur ice hockey and retain the flexibility to play tennis during the summers. The first European to play in the NHL eventually became Ulf Sterner from Sweden when he started for the New York Rangers for the first time on 27 January 1965.\n\nIn 1955, Jaroslav Drobný published his autobiography titled \"Champion in Exile\". He was married to Rita Anderson Jarvis, onetime English tournament player. He died 13 September 2001 in Tooting, London aged 79.\n\nIvan Blatný wrote a poem called \"Wimbledon\" which addresses Drobný.\n\n\n"}

(Simplified Chinese: 邓以明; Traditional Chinese: 鄧以明; Pinyin: Dèng Yǐmíng; Wade-Giles: Teng I-ming; May 13, 1908 - June 27, 1995) was a Chinese Jesuit priest. Appointed Bishop in 1951 and later archbishop of Canton, he spent twenty-two years in jail for his loyalty to the Catholic Church and died in exile in the United States.\n\nHe was born in Hong Kong and decided to enter the Jesuit novitiate in Spain in August 1930. Back in China, he studied Catholicism in Shanghai. He was ordained as a priest at the age of 33 on 31 May 1941 during World War II. After his ordination he worked as a parish priest, principal of a primary school and did social welfare work in the Ecclesiastical Province of Guangzhou. Pope Pius XII\nappointed him on 1 October 1950 as Apostolic Administrator of Canton (Guangzhou), and on 13 February 1951 was ordained titular bishop of Elateia by Bishop Gustave Deswaziere, who said of him: \"\"By accepting the appointment from the Holy See in these difficult times, the new bishop was showing absolute obedience and a spirit of sacrifice.\"\"\n\nArchbishop Tang was arrested on February 5, 1958. The People's Republic of China charged him as \"the most faithful running-dog of the reactionary Vatican.\" He remained in jail for 22 years in Laogai prison because he refused to sever contact with the Pope, as the government ordered him to. His sudden release in 1981 was due to a developing cancer, he then was given permission to leave the People's Republic of China for a cancer operation in Hong Kong.\n\nArchbishop Tang was never brought to trial, and therefore, was never convicted of any crime. After his release, he never showed any bitterness for his 22 years of imprisonment, even though no apology was ever given by the Chinese government.\n\nOn 26 May 1981, at the age of 73, he was appointed Archbishop of Canton (Guangzhou), which was rejected by China at once. In 1987, he released his book \"How Inscrutable His Ways!\" In it he summarized his attitudes while incarcerated for 22 years:\n\n\nHe died in Stamford, Connecticut at the age of 87 and was buried at Mission Santa Clara de Asís in Santa Clara, California. \n\n"}
{"id": "2138018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138018", "title": "Ruslan Abdulgani", "text": "Ruslan Abdulgani\n\nRuslan Abdulgani (November 24, 1914, Surabaya — June 29, 2005, Jakarta, his first name is also spelled Roeslan) was an Indonesian government official and diplomat known for his role as a leader during the Indonesian National Revolution in the late 1940s, and as a key minister and United Nations ambassador in the Sukarno government during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRuslan was born and raised in Surabaya, East Java. He came from an upper-middle-class family; his father was a neighborhood shopkeeper and owned a small fleet of taxis. His mother, his father's second wife, was a religious tutor, giving reading and religion lessons from the Qur'an. According to a memoir of his childhood, which Ruslan wrote in the 1970s, his mother was also a strong Javanese nationalist, and it was from her that he first learned about Dutch colonial rule and the possibility of independence. \n\nDuring the Indonesian fight for independence from the Dutch in the late 1940s, Ruslan was a key lieutenant under Sukarno, earning the future president's trust and ensuring him a secure place in the new government. In the 1950s he served most prominently as foreign minister, representing Indonesia abroad during the tumultuous decade when, under Sukarno's leadership, Indonesia tried to transform itself into a postcolonial, anti-imperialist success story. \n\nRuslan's most prominent moment as a public servant came in 1955, when he served as secretary-general of the Bandung Conference, a major meeting of African and Asian countries working to form what became the Non-Aligned Movement as an alternative to alignment with one of the Cold War superpowers. Ruslan served as Indonesia's foreign minister from March 1956 to April 1957. From July 1959 to March 1962, he was head of the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA); in October 1962 he became Minister of Information.\n\nWhile being foreign minister, Ruslan was briefly arrested in August 1956 by the Indonesian military in West Java, and accused of corruption. Part of a power struggle between the Sukarno government and dissatisfied military officers, he was promptly pardoned by vote of Sukarno's cabinet, and the military was forced to release him.\n\nWhile being a minister in 1964, he was a first rector of Teacher and Education Science Institute or now is Indonesia University of Education. He acted as rector until 1966.\n\nAfter Suharto replaced Sukarno as president in 1967, Ruslan served briefly as Indonesian ambassador to the United Nations. He left formal government service in 1971, but continued to play a role as an elder statesman in Indonesian politics. After president Suharto stepped down in 1998, he emerged as an advisor to presidential candidate Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sukarno's daughter, and as a critic of Suharto's Golkar successors, Jusuf Habibie and Abdurrahman Wahid. \n\nIn 1998 Dutch historians Bob de Graaff and Cees Wiebes published a book, \"Villa Maarheeze: De Geschiedenis van de Inlichtingendienst Buitenland\" (\"Villa Maarheeze: The History of the Netherlands Foreign Intelligence Service\") in which they alleged that Ruslan had secretly worked for the Dutch government during the conflict over Papua (Irian Jaya) in the 1960s, by passing confidential information about Indonesian activities. Ruslan vehemently denied the charges, saying that he had seldom even communicated with the Dutch government even in his official government capacities.\n\nRuslan's wife Sihwati Nawangwulan, also a prominent activist during Indonesia's independence movement, died in 2001 at the age of 85. Ruslan and Sihwati had five children together. Ruslan died in June 2005 after suffering from stroke and pneumonia. He was one of the last survivors of Indonesia's war for independence. \n\nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called him \"a leader who never said bad things about others\". Suharto called him \"a great man and leader who has given so much for the country he loves\". \n\nHis second daughter, Retnowati Abdulgani-Knapp, wrote a biography about her father, \"A Fading Dream: The Story of Roeslan Abdulgani and Indonesia\", which was published in 2003. In it, she described Ruslan as a lifelong fighter against colonialism and imperialism.\n\nAbdulgani was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1956.\n\nDocumentary: http://www.hollanddoc.nl/kijk-luister/landen-en-regios/indonesie.html?playurn=urn:vpro:media:program:3183124&currentPage=1\n\n"}

Farhaan, a law graduate, was brought up with ideals of non-violence and patriotism. Dev unwittingly gives Farhaan the wound that plunges him into rage and violence after witnessing the death of his father during a peace demonstration. Taking advantage of the situation, corrupt politician Latif sets the vulnerable young man on a path of violence and destruction that threatens to ignite the city. Aaliya is the light in Farhaan's life. Beautiful and innocent, the young woman also gets caught in extraordinary circumstances that transform her life and she dares to stand up for the truth. Dev is the saga of Dev and Tej's friendship, a bond stronger than blood ties in which Farhaan emerges as the wedge driving them apart. The story unfolds against the vitiated atmosphere of present times where innocent lives become fodder for political expediency. The spark of terrorist violence unknowingly set off by Farhaan under the aegis of the corrupt politician Latif engulfs the whole city in its flames. Tej transgresses beyond the boundaries of law in his passion to eliminate anti-national crime. Dev is faced with the spectre of the tragic human cost and a moral compulsion to act. The stakes rise beyond self-interest. Dev and Tej are set on a path of dramatic collision. Even as Dev and Farhaan's fate gets irreversibly linked, two soldiers whose allegiance may be to different causes but admiration for each other's courage and integrity brings them together.\n\nOn a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He comes to know that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes a wave of riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer. But will Dev trust a man who just attempted to kill him? And will Latif and Mangal Rao join forces to eliminate Farhaan, who now has become a liability to both sides.\n\n\n\nThe soundtrack features 7 songs composed by Aadesh Shrivastav, with lyrics by Nida Fazli and Govind Nihalani.\n\n"}

Flippen (March 6, 1899 – February 3, 1971) was an American character actor who often played police officers or weary criminals in many films of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBorn on March 6, 1899 in Little Rock, Arkansas, Flippen was an established and respected vaudeville singer and stage actor before his film career. He had been discovered by famed African-American comedian Bert Williams in the 1920s. He called himself \"The Ham What Am,\" and performed occasionally in blackface. Flippen attained the most coveted booking in vaudeville, headlining at the Palace Theatre in New York six times between March 1926 and February 1931.\n\nAt one time he was also a radio announcer for New York Yankees games and was one of the first game show announcers. Between 1924 and 1929, Flippen recorded more than thirty songs for Columbia, Perfect and Brunswick.\n\nHis first film, the 1928 Warner Bros. short subject \"The Ham What Am\", captures his vaudeville performance, and there are other shorts in the 1930s, but his film career started in earnest in 1947. Some of Flippen's most noteworthy film work came in support of James Stewart in five of the films the two made under the direction of Anthony Mann during the 1950s. He gave notable supporting performances in three John Wayne films: as a humorous, larcenous Marine air crew line chief in \"Flying Leathernecks\" (1951); as Wayne's commanding general in \"Jet Pilot\" (1957); and as a wheelchair-bound senior partner of Wayne's in \"Hellfighters\" (1968). He also made a fourth film which co-starred John Wayne (\"How the West Was Won\", 1962), but played his only scene with Debbie Reynolds and Gregory Peck.\n\nHe also appeared on television, including a 1960 guest-starring role as Gabe Jethrow in the episode \"Four Came Quietly\" on the CBS western series \"Johnny Ringo\", starring Don Durant. In 1962, he guest starred on the ABC drama series \"Bus Stop\" as Mike Carmody in \"Verdict of 12\" and \"Follow the Sun\" as Fallon in \"The Last of the Big Spenders.\" He also appeared on ABC's \"The Untouchables\" as Al Morrisey in \"You Can't Pick the Number\" (1959) and as Big Joe Holvak in \"Fall Guy\" (1962). In the 1962-63 season, Flippen was cast as Chief Petty Officer Homer Nelson on the NBC sitcom \"Ensign O'Toole\", with Dean Jones in the starring role.\n\nHe also guest starred on CBS' \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" in its first season, playing Rob Petrie's former mentor Happy Spangler. In 1964, he appeared as Owney in an episode of CBS' \"Gunsmoke\" with James Arness. In 1963, he guest starred on \"Bonanza\". He appeared four times on NBC's \"The Virginian\" in the 1960s; in 1966, he appeared on the ABC comedy western \"The Rounders\". In 1967, he and Tom Tryon guest starred in the episode \"Charade of Justice\" of the NBC western series \"The Road West\". After a leg amputation in 1965, Flippen continued acting, usually using a wheelchair, such as in his comeback role in a 1966 episode of \"The Virginian\", and his 1967 guest appearance in \"Ironside\" (Season 1 \"A Very Cool Hot Car\").\n\nHe was married for 25 years to screenwriter Ruth Brooks Flippen.\n\nWhile filming \"Cat Ballou\" in 1965, he had to have one of his legs amputated due to a serious infection, originally resulting from a minor scrape with a car door, and likely complicated with diabetes. Flippen finished his scenes in that film in great pain, and after the amputation he took a short period of recuperation and healing, then returned to work, from that period forward taking roles that did not hide his disability.\n\nFlippen died February 3, 1971, aged 71, during surgery for an aneurysm caused by a swollen artery, one month before his 72nd birthday. He was interred in a crypt in the Corridor of Memories section at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\n"}

Hinton also taught at the University of California, San Diego, published books and magazine articles on marine biology, and worked as a calligrapher and artist.\n\nSam Hinton was born March 31, 1917 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised largely in Crockett, Texas, and studied zoology for two years at Texas A&M, helping to finance his education via singing appearances. Leaving college, he moved to Washington D.C. to stay with his parents, where he worked as a window decorator for a department store and did scientific illustration for the Smithsonian in the evenings. While in Washington he and his two sisters Ann and Nell formed a semi-professional singing group called \"The Texas Trio,\" and performed locally. In 1937 the group visited New York City to win a Major Bowes' Amateur Hour competition, at which time he was invited to join the travelling Bowes troupe as a single act. Hinton left school to tour the country with the troupe, finally settling in Los Angeles three years later, where he enrolled at UCLA to study marine biology, and met his wife, Leslie. During his stay in Los Angeles, he landed a role in the musical comedy \"Meet the People\" alongside then-unknowns including Virginia O'Brien, Nanette Fabray, and Doodles Weaver. After graduating from UCLA in 1940, Hinton was appointed director of the Desert Museum in Palm Springs, California, where he served from 1942 to 1944, moving on to San Diego, California in 1944 as Editor of Illustration at the University of California Division of War Research (UCDWR), a University of California-wide wartime laboratory that was located at Point Loma. In 1946 he was appointed Curator of the Thomas Wayland Vaughan Aquarium Museum at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and served there until 1964. In 1965, Hinton transitioned to the University of California at San Diego as Assistant Director, Relations with Schools, and in 1967 he became Associate Director. Despite his professional duties, he has continued performing throughout his life.\n\nIn 1947 Hinton recorded 56 songs, including \"Buffalo Boy\" and the \"Barnyard Song\" for the Library of Congress. His first commercial recording, \"Old Man Atom\" (by Vern Partlow) followed on Columbia in 1950. Over the next several years he also made a number of singles for Decca's Children's Series, and in 1952 issued his first LP, \"Folk Songs of California\". After three more efforts for Decca – 1955's \"Singing Across the Land\", 1956's \"A Family Tree of Folk Songs\" and 1957's \"The Real McCoy\" – he moved to Folkways for 1961's \"Whoever Shall Have Some Good Peanuts\" and 1967's \"The Wandering Folksong\". None of Hinton's musical projects distracted him from his academic duties, however, and from 1948 onward he taught UCSD courses in biology and folklore; for the National Education Television network, he also hosted a 13-part series on folk music, and for several years even wrote a regular newspaper column, \"The Ocean World,\" for the \"San Diego Union\". Hinton additionally co-wrote two books on marine research, \"Exploring Under the Sea\" and \"Common Seashore Animals of Southern California\".\n\nIn 1957, Hinton founded the San Diego Folk Song Society. He made what many contend was his final public appearance at the May 11, 2002 San Diego Folk Heritage Festival, and the daylong event at the Children's School in La Jolla was permanently renamed the Sam Hinton Folk Heritage Festival. As of 2015, San Diego Folk Heritage continues to present the festival every summer in Old Poway Park.\n\nBooks\n\nBooks illustrated by Hinton\n\n\n\n"}

In the next phase of the work, Kukowski referred to his first works, but despite his lighter tones his paintings became more and more ironic and provocative.\n\nThe artist also cooperates with musicians and avant-garde artists. His works are used for illustrative forms related to contemporary music (he collaborates with the Theater of Creation and the alternative formation of Peter Murphy - Dali's Car - a record - \"InGladAloneness\".\n\n\n\nHe is also the creator of animations documenting the creative process of his paintings.\n\n\n"}

He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 0 Chevrolet Camaro for JD Motorsports. Born in Fenton, Missouri, he is the younger brother of Rusty Wallace, older brother of Kenny Wallace, and uncle of Steve Wallace. His daughter, Chrissy Wallace, and son, Matt Wallace, are also active in racing competition.\n\nWallace made his Busch Series debut in 1990 at the season-closing Winston Classic at Martinsville Speedway. Starting 24th, Wallace finished sixth in the No. 40 Lowes Foods-sponsored Chevrolet. The next season, he ran nine Busch races for a variety of different teams, and had a third-place finish at Lanier Raceway. He also made his Winston Cup debut at the Pyroil 500, where he finished 31st in the Jimmy Means-owned car. It also marked the first time since the 1950s that three brothers competed against each other in a Winston Cup race, as Rusty and Kenny drove in that race also.\n\nIn 1992, Wallace signed on with Moroso Racing to pilot the No. 20 First Ade-sponsored Oldsmobile. They also ran a Cup race together at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Wallace finished thirty-third. Despite a tenth-place run at Martinsville, Wallace was dismissed from the ride nearly half-way into the season. Late in the year, he was hired by Barry Owen to drive his No. 9 Oldsmobile, replacing the late Clifford Allison. After a ninth-place finish in their first race at Dover International Speedway, Wallace posted a second-place finish at Martinsville. Wallace and Owen also ran a pair of Cup races, their best finish a 20th at Atlanta. They ran the entire Busch schedule in 1993, with sponsorship from FDP Brakes. Wallace had nine Top 10’s that season finished a career-high 12th in the final points standings. He also finished in the Top 15 in the first time in his Cup career when he finished 15th at Atlanta.\n\nEarly in 1994, Wallace was hired by Junie Donlavey to drive his No. 90 Heilig-Meyers-sponsored Ford Thunderbird in the Winston Cup Series. Although he competed in 22 of the scheduled 31 races that year, Wallace finished fifth in the Rookie of the Year standings and 33rd in the final point standings. His season was capped off with a fifth-place finish at the Hooters 500. In the Busch Series, he won his first career race at Dover, followed by victories at The Milwaukee Mile and Indianapolis Raceway Park. The following season, Wallace failed to qualify for five races in the Cup series and dropped a spot in the standings. His lone lead-lap finish came at Bristol Motor Speedway, where he finished ninth. In the Busch Series, his team switched to No. 90 with a sponsorship from Duron Paints, and posted two second-place finishes. He also made his Craftsman Truck Series debut that season at North Wilkesboro Speedway, and finished 29th in the MB Motorsports truck.\n\nTwelve races into the 1996 season, Wallace was released from his Cup ride with Donlavey. Despite moving back down into the Busch Series full-time, Wallace only posted one top ten in the second half of the season, forcing Owen's team to close its doors. Wallace began 1997 with high hopes in the No. 91 LJ Racing Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by Joe Falk and Ron Neal. The team had moved up from the Busch Series and signed Spam as a full-time sponsor but after many DNQ's and the best finish of 17th at Texas Motor Speedway, the team lost its sponsor and Wallace found himself without a ride. He also split time in the Busch Series in the No. 7 Chevrolet for Ed Whitaker, making six starts. Midway through the season, he left for the Truck series, driving the No. 52 Purolator-sponsored Chevrolet Silverado for Ken Schrader Racing. Despite only running 15 races that season, he finished 23rd in points. He also finished in the Top 10 in each of the last four races of the season, including California Speedway, where he finished second.\n\nWallace returned to run the Truck Series full-time in 1998 for Schrader. Although he did not win that season, he won his first career NASCAR pole at New Hampshire International Speedway and had seven top tens en route to a 15th-place point finish. He also ran six Busch races for Andy Petree Racing, Washington-Erving Motorsports, and the Curb Agajanian Performance Group, his best finish coming at IRP for Petree. In addition, he ran the Daytona 500 in an entry for Phil Barkdoll, starting and finishing 23rd.\n\nIn 1999, he left Schrader to drive the No. 2 Team ASE Racing Ford F-150 for Ultra Motorsports. He won in his first race for Ultra at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and won again six races later at Pikes Peak International Raceway. He finished sixth in points that year. He also returned to Donlavey in Cup to run the Daytona 500 for him, and finished 23rd, as well finishing 24th in an Ultra-owned car at Richmond International Raceway. The following year, Wallace won an additional two truck races and moved up to fourth in points. He also ran eight Busch races for Moy Racing, his best finish a fourteenth at IRP.\n\nAfter Ultra purchased the Mattei Motorsports No. 7 Nations Rent-sponsored Cup team, Wallace was announced as the driver for 2001. Despite starting off the season with a sixth-place finish at the Daytona 500, the team struggled in qualifying, almost costing Wallace his job before he posted two consecutive top tens finishes. During that time, he began running with a new Busch Series team, Biagi Brothers Racing, running their No. 4 Geico-sponsored Chevy. His best finish of eight starts was a tenth at Richmond International Raceway. Late in the season, Wallace was granted his release from Ultra, and joined Penske-Kranefuss Racing, driving the No. 12 Mobil 1-sponsored Ford Taurus as a teammate to his brother Rusty. At Phoenix, he led 45 laps late in the race before giving the lead up to Jeff Burton, finishing a career-best second place. Unfortunately, Penske decided not to keep the 12 team going, forcing Wallace out of a ride (Penske did keep the number 12 for Ryan Newman's team the following year, replacing the 02 Newman had used in a few races in 2001). He began the season driving for Andy Petree for a pair of races before financial problems caused that team to cease operations. He returned to run with Biagi for seventeen races in the Busch Series, posting two consecutive fourteenth-place finishes. Wallace also returned to the Truck series driving the Federated Auto Parts-sponsored truck for Schrader, posting two Top 10’s. Mid-season, he signed onto the No. 14 Conseco-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for A. J. Foyt Racing, his best finish a tenth at Bristol.\n\nIn 2003, Biagi Bros. began racing full-time in the Busch Series with Wallace. Despite missing two races, Wallace had three Top 10’s and finished 13th in the final standings. In the Cup series, he had two Top 10’s driving for Phoenix, as well as making eight starts filling for Jerry Nadeau in the No. 01 U.S. Army-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for MB2/MBV Motorsports. In addition to running two races for Schrader in the Truck Series, he also competed in a pair of events for Brevak Racing, his best finish fifteenth at Phoenix. In 2004, at the mid-season race at Daytona, Wallace took the lead on the last lap and won his fourth career race, the first for Biagi in one of the biggest wins of his career. The following week at Chicagoland Speedway, he led 18 laps and almost won before running out of fuel on the final lap. In the Cup Series, he drove three races for Arnold Motorsports, before leading 45 laps and finishing seventh at Richmond for Phoenix. He finished the season driving the No. 4 Lucas Oil-sponsored Chevy for Morgan-McClure Motorsports.\n\nWallace began driving for MMM full-time in 2005. Despite an eighth-place finish at the Pepsi 400, Wallace was released towards the end of the season by MMM. He returned to the Truck Series briefly for Darrell Waltrip Motorsports, finishing in the Top 9 twice. He drove for a variety of different teams in the Busch Series, among them Akins Motorsports, Rusty Wallace, Inc. and Evernham Motorsports, with whom he finished second at his hometown track in Gateway.\n\nHe began 2006 in the Truck Series running for HT Motorsports but was released after finishing thirty-first in each of his first two starts. Already signed on to run Phoenix's Cup car, Miccosukee Resorts Dodge signed Wallace to be their full-time driver for the remainder of 2006 to replace Jason Keller and had three Top 5 finishes. In 2007, Wallace piloted the No. 7 GEICO-sponsored Chevrolet for Phoenix Racing with teammate J. J. Yeley. Despite no Top 10 finishes, he ended the season 11th in points.\n\nWallace finished fourth in the 2007 Daytona 500, his best finish in the event.\n\nIn 2008, Wallace, GEICO, and his car number moved from Phoenix Racing to Germain Racing, where he drove a Toyota Camry. He had eight Top 10’s and finished a career best eight in points. After he did not renew his contract with Germain, Wallace attempted the 2009 Daytona 500 for Kevin Buckler but failed to make the race by just one position in his Gatorade Duel qualifying race. In June 2009, Larry Gunselman tapped Wallace for a ride in his No. 64 Toyota to compete in Pocono just days after Todd Bodine left the team. On October 31, 2009, in the Mountain Dew 250, he raced the No. 48 for Fast Track Racing Enterprises in the Camping World Truck Series along with his daughter Chrissy Wallace. It was the first time that a father and daughter raced in the same race. Wallace finished 28th after an accident and Chrissy finished 13th. He also signed on as a full-time driver of the No. 01 JD Motorsports in the Nationwide Series.\n\nWallace led late in 2011 Aaron's 312 but flipped in a multi-car accident. Wallace drove the car back to pit road and was credited with an 18th-place finish.\n\nNear the end of the 2011 season, Wallace won the NCWTS Coca-Cola 250 at Talladega Superspeedway after being pushed by Ron Hornaday for the majority of the race.\n\nHe attempted to qualify for the 2012 Daytona 500 in the No. 37 Ford, fielded by Max Q Motorsports and Rick Ware Racing, but failed to qualify for the race.\n\nWallace drove for JD Motorsports in the Nationwide Series full-time during the 2013 season.\n\nIn 2014, Wallace drove part-time for JGL Racing in the Nationwide Series. He also returned to Sprint Cup, driving for Identity Ventures Racing in several late-season Cup events, with a best finish of 26th.\n\nWallace began 2015 driving for Premium Motorsports in the No. 66 Sprint Cup car. He began the season by finishing 36th in the Daytona 500. However, after failing to qualify for the next two races he was released. Wallace then had triple-bypass heart surgery in April, keeping him out of racing for the summer. Wallace is currently planning a return to Cup competition with Rick Ware Racing, depending on sponsorship but he never raced.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, Wallace and daughter Lindsey were assaulted after a Rascal Flatts concert in the Charlotte area. Three men were arrested in connection to the incident, which left Wallace with a concussion and a dozen stitches. In an October 2016 trial, a mistrial was declared due to witnesses being present during the prosecution was making its case with another witness. On February 14, 2017, prosecutors dropped charges in accordance with the wishes of the Wallace family.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

{"id": "2138097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138097", "title": "Dallas Sportatorium", "text": "Dallas Sportatorium\n\nThe Sportatorium, located in downtown Dallas, Texas, was a barn-like arena used primarily for professional wrestling events. The building, which stood at 1000 S. Industrial Blvd, or the intersection of Industrial Boulevard and Cadiz Street (near the I-30/I-35E Interchange), had a seating capacity of approximately 4,500.\n\nBuilt in 1934 by the Cox Fence Company, the original Dallas Sportatorium was constructed in the shape of an octagon, and seated approximately 10,000. Its inaugural wrestling event, promoted by Burt Willoughby, took place on December 9, 1935. Willoughby promoted wrestling at the Sportatorium until 1940, when the company was bought out by its former concessions manager, Ed McLemore.\n\nFrom 1948 until 1966, the Sportatorium was also the site of the \"Big D Jamboree\", a weekly country music showcase similar in format to the \"Grand Ole Opry\" and \"Louisiana Hayride\"; portions of the Jamboree were broadcast nationally on the CBS Radio Network.\n\nThe Sportatorium was partially destroyed by fire on May 1, 1953, in what was rumored to be an act of arson by a rival wrestling promoter. It was quickly rebuilt at the same location as a rectangular venue (with a modified octagonal seating configuration similar to the original), and reopened on September 22 of that year, billed at the time as \"The Million-Dollar Sportatorium\". The arena also held boxing events and concerts featuring up-and-coming rock stars over the years, very much in the same manner as its Los Angeles counterpart, the Grand Olympic Auditorium, did during this time frame.\n\nIn late 1966, McLemore formed a partnership with wrestler Jack Adkisson, who was known in the ring as Fritz Von Erich and bought the Dallas/Fort Worth Wrestling Office, breaking away from Paul Boesch and the Houston Wrestling Office. In January 1968, McLemore started suffering a series of heart attacks and was no longer able to attend to the company's day-to-day business; he died on January 9, 1969, leaving Adkisson in charge. Adkisson's promotion, which became known in the early 1980s as World Class Championship Wrestling and featured his sons as its top stars, was the most famous and successful wrestling federation to run regularly at the Dallas Sportatorium.\nThe arena was configured with several ring aisles with the majority of the seats (mostly bleachers) set up on the east, south and west portions of the building. The north side of the building, best known as \"Section D\", was used mostly for a small stage and media area for cameras and reporters, but at least 10 rows of seats were also set up between the main stage/ring and the wall. A United States flag was displayed on the wall of section D for most of the arena's existence, and was changed once when the 48-star U.S. flag was replaced with a 50-star U.S. flag in 1960. The flag was moved to the section C area in 1987, then later above section I in the 1990s when the arena was refurbished for the Global Wrestling Federation.\n\nDuring wrestling matches, the heel wrestlers came out of the northwest aisle, between sections B & C, while the babyfaces came out of the aisle on the southwest corner, or sections J & A. A broadcast studio was set up adjacent to the heel's locker room area; and an overhead section was later added for wrestling announcers to call the match.\n\nOn the Industrial Blvd side of the arena was the offices of Big Time Wrestling/World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). Jack Adkisson and his sons each shared office space in the arena. Others like David Manning, Gary Hart, Ken Mantell, Percy Pringle, Skandor Akbar and Chris Adams would also occupy the front offices of the arena.\n\nEric Embry, who was the Sportatorium's lead booker, lived inside the arena for a time in 1989.\n\nAfter WCCW folded in 1990 due to dwindling attendance, fundamental changes in the wrestling industry and tragedies involving a number of its top stars (including all but one of the Von Erichs, Gino Hernandez, and Bruiser Brody), the Sportatorium served as home base for the Global Wrestling Federation from 1991 to 1994 (billing itself for a time as the \"GlobalDome\"). Following the GWF's demise, a succession of smaller promotions (including the NWA between 1995 and 1996) attempted to hold shows in the building, each of them running out of money and closing their doors after only a short time.\n\nHowever, it did gain one last bit of notoriety when Dallas-based Southwest Airlines held an arm-wrestling match between chairman Herb Kelleher and Kurt Herwald, chairman of Stevens Aviation, resulting from controversy over Southwest's use of the slogan \"Just Plane Smart\" (Stevens claimed that it infringed on its own \"Plane Smart\" slogan). The match was a publicity stunt designed to raise funds for charity.\n\nThe Sportatorium fell into disuse in the late 1990s when local independent wrestling promotions, by now drawing crowds only in the low hundreds, elected to run their shows in dance halls and other smaller venues instead. In addition, the aging arena was seriously dilapidated by this time, was out of compliance with local building codes, and was often used as a shelter by homeless people who entered the building illegally.\n\nIn late December 2001 a fire started inside the building. The flames quickly spread and caused major damage to the arena's upstairs offices. The fire proved to be the coup de grâce for the Sportatorium, its long-rumored demolition finally taking place in the spring of 2003. Before its implosion, Kevin Von Erich took off a bench-seat and a few items from the Sportatorium as souvenirs. Kevin took one final tour of the historic arena, which was featured in its famed DVD documentary \"Heroes of World Class\", released in 2006. Exactly 10 years after the death of Kerry Von Erich, February 18, 2003, the \"World Famous Sportatorium\" Main Entrance sign was saved from demolition by wrestling announcer Doyle King, who retains possession of it to this day. It has been on display at several local wrestling reunions and some local Dallas Fort Worth wrestling events.\n\nAlthough it had a reputation for being uncomfortable and unsanitary (having inadequate heating and cooling facilities, rodent infestation problems and apparently a large chamber or pit in the foundation), the Dallas Sportatorium is nonetheless still remembered fondly for its intimate atmosphere, and is considered one of pro wrestling's most legendary venues.\n\nThe land that occupied the now-defunct arena is slated to be a part of the new Trinity River Project, which has led to the renaming of Industrial Boulevard to Riverfront Boulevard.\n\n"}

After playing with Blood, Sweat & Tears, he worked with drummer Billy Cobham, then with trumpeter Miles Davis from 1981 to 1983 and again in 1985. He then began a solo career, releasing more than a dozen albums.\n\nStern was named Best Jazz Guitarist of 1993 by \"Guitar Player\" magazine. At the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal in June 2007, he was given the Miles Davis Award, which was created to recognize internationally acclaimed jazz artists whose work has contributed significantly to the renewal of the genre. In 2009 Stern was listed on \"Down Beat\"s list of 75 best jazz guitarists of all time. He received \"Guitar Player\" magazine's Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012.\n\nStern was born Michael Sedgwick in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Helen Stern (née Helen Phillips Burroughs), a sculptor and art patron, and Henry Dwight Sedgwick V. His adoptive stepfather was Philip M. Stern, the son of businessman Edgar B. Stern Sr and philanthropist Edith Rosenwald Stern, and grandson of philanthropist Julius Rosenwald. His sister Holly is the mother of actor Philip Nozuka and singers George Nozuka, Justin Nozuka and Henry Nozuka. His other (half-)sister is actress Kyra Sedgwick. Stern is married to guitarist and vocalist Leni Stern.\n\nStern grew up in Washington, D.C., and attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston. When he was twenty-two, he became a member of Blood, Sweat & Tears and spent three years with the band, appearing on the albums \"More Than Ever\" and \"Brand New Day.\"\n\nIn 1979, he joined Billy Cobham's fusion band. Two years later he joined Miles Davis, making his public debut in 1981, a performance recorded on the album \"We Want Miles\". He remained with Davis through 1983 until he was replaced by guitarist John Scofield. At the time, Stern was a heavy drinker and heroin user. In a 2009 interview, he said, \"If Miles wants to put you in a rehab, you know you've got something wrong\". From 1983 to 1984 he toured with Jaco Pastorius (a period also characterized by heavy drug use) and in 1985 returned to tour with Davis. Stern and his wife were in rehabilitation; they were also helped by Michael Brecker and others.\n\nStern's solo debut, \"Upside Downside\", with Jaco Pastorius, David Sanborn, and Bob Berg, was released on Atlantic Records in 1986. From 1986 through 1988, he was a member of Michael Brecker's quintet, appearing on \"Don't Try This at Home.\" His second Atlantic album, 1988's \"Time in Place\", featured Peter Erskine on drums, Jim Beard on keyboards, Jeff Andrews on bass, Don Alias on percussion and Don Grolnick on organ. His next album, \"Jigsaw\", was produced by guitarist Steve Khan and included the song \"Chief\", Stern's tribute to Miles Davis.\n\nIn 1989, Stern formed a touring group with Bob Berg, Dennis Chambers and Lincoln Goines. They remained together through 1992 and are featured on the album \"Odds or Evens\". In 1992, Stern joined a reunited Brecker Brothers Band for two years. His acclaimed 1993 album, \"Standards (and Other Songs)\", led to his being named Best Jazz Guitarist of the Year by the readers and critics of \"Guitar Player\". He followed that with 1994's \"Is What It Is\" and 1996's \"Between the Lines\", both of which received Grammy Award nominations. In 1997 he released \"Give and Take\", with bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette, percussionist Don Alias and special guests Michael Brecker and David Sanborn. He won the Orville W. Gibson Award for Best Jazz Guitarist.\n\nAfter fifteen years with Atlantic, Stern signed with ESC Records for the 2004 release of \"These Times\", an eclectic album that included guest appearances by bassist Richard Bona, saxophonist Kenny Garrett and banjoist Béla Fleck. He joined the Heads Up label with the August 2006 release of \"Who Let the Cats Out\"? In 2008, he collaborated with the Yellowjackets for their \"Lifecycle\" album, contributing two compositions and performing on most of the tracks, and toured with the Yellowjackets for much of 2008 and 2009. In February 2009, in the first of a series of articles celebrating \"Down Beat\"s 75th anniversary, Stern was named one of the 75 Great Guitarists of all time.\n\nIn August 2009, Stern released \"Big Neighborhood\", which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.\n\nHe was presented with \"Guitar Player\" magazine's Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012. This was given to him at the Muriel Anderson All-Star Guitar night, where he performed with Lee Ritenour. Other guitarists who have won the award include Les Paul, Duane Eddy, Dick Dale, Larry Carlton and Tommy Emmanuel. In June of that year, Stern released \"All Over the Place\", featuring trumpeter Randy Brecker, saxophonists Kenny Garrett, Chris Potter, Bob Franceschini and Bob Malach, drummers Dave Weckl, Keith Carlock, Lionel Cordew, Al Foster, Kim Thompson, keyboardist/producer Jim Beard, and Stern's wife, guitarist and vocalist Leni Stern. Acoustic and electric bassist present included Esperanza Spalding, Richard Bona, Victor Wooten, Anthony Jackson, Dave Holland, Tom Kennedy, Will Lee and Victor Bailey.\n\nIn 2014, Stern toured with guitarist Eric Johnson in the Eclectic Guitar Tour. They recorded an album of the same name.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Stern reported serious injuries to his shoulders and right arm after tripping and falling. It ended his European tour, and he had to modify his playing technique to keep performing. In the summer of 2017 he returned to Europe on tour with a new formation called Mike Stern/Randy Brecker Band, featuring Randy Brecker (trumpet), Teymur Phell (bass guitar) and Lenny White (drums).\n\nIn 2017, Stern recorded \"Mike Stern: Burn with Stern!\", a series of jazz guitar instructional videos for TAGAPublishing.com.\n\nAn early and important guitar for Stern was a hybrid 1950s/1960s Fender Telecaster, previously owned by Roy Buchanan and Danny Gatton, which was stolen from him in an armed robbery in Boston. This guitar is the basis for a custom-made guitar built by Boston-based luthier Michael Aronson.\n\nThe Aronson guitar is in turn the basis for the Yamaha PA1511MS, the Mike Stern signature model. The neck position pickup is a Seymour Duncan '59 and it has a Tele Hot Rail in the bridge.\n\nStern uses a pair of Fender '65 Twin Reverb amps or his Yamaha G100-212. Stern's recognizable chorused sound is created in part by a Yamaha SPX-90, split for stereo. His pedal board consists mostly of Boss pedals. He uses two Boss DD-3 digital delays, one of which is set to a long delay time for \"big, spacey sounds.\" His distortion pedal is a Boss Distortion DS-1.\n\n\n\n"}

The latter once ran through to Winchester but was closed to passengers in February 1973; it reopened as a heritage line in 1985. Two other routes, both now closed, also served the station – the Meon Valley line to Fareham and the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway.\n\nServices operate along the Alton Line to Brookwood and join the South West Main Line towards London Waterloo.

The line from Woking to Alton was electrified in 1937 and the station passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\n\nWhen Sectorisation was introduced in 1986, the station was served by Network SouthEast, until the privatisation of British Rail in 1997.\n\nAlton station is located in the local government district of East Hampshire.\n\nThe station is nowhere near Alton Towers Resort, which is located in the rural village of Alton in Staffordshire, about 185 miles away. Many people trying to reach the resort have mistakenly travelled to this station. Local residents, who have encountered many people trying to find Alton Towers, have put up posters at the station containing directions from the station to the resort by train, with a journey time of approximately 4 hours and 46 minutes.\n\nMonday to Saturdays there is a half-hourly service to London Waterloo and an hourly service on Sundays, increasing to half-hourly from approximately 1330.\n\nServices are usually operated by Class 450 \"Desiro\" units, although the Class 444 & Class 458 is also sometimes used.\n\n\n"}

He played parts of six seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was an All-American college player for Michigan State, where he led the Spartans to a national championship in 2000.\n\nHe was a heavily recruited high school athlete. His recruiting trip with the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team touched off a major scandal after he was a passenger in a rollover accident. Cleaves eventually agreed to attend Michigan State University, the University of Michigan's in-state rival. He is one of the four MSU players from Flint, Michigan, dubbed \"The Flintstones.\"\n\nCleaves, a three-time Michigan State captain, led the Spartans to the 2000 national championship, and was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four.\n\nThe school's only three-time All-American, Cleaves was named Big Ten Player of the Year twice. He led MSU and the conference in career assists with 816, and is Michigan State's all-time steals leader (193). In his final home game on senior night in East Lansing, Cleaves dished out 20 assists, breaking the Big Ten single-game and career assist marks.\n\nOn February 3, 2007, Cleaves became the eighth MSU player to have his number retired.\n\nIn 2000, Cleaves was selected 14th overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. During the 2000–01 season, he played in 78 games, averaging 5.4 points and 2.7 assists.\n\nCleaves was traded to the Sacramento Kings shortly before the 2001–02 season for Jon Barry and a first-round draft pick. After two seasons playing sparingly, he signed as a free agent with the Boston Celtics, but was waived before the 2003–04 season. He played with the Cleveland Cavaliers in four games. He was then signed by the Seattle SuperSonics, was cut during the 2004–05 season, and re-signed during the following season.\n\nFollowing his NBA stint, Cleaves appeared for the Fayetteville Patriots and the Bakersfield Jam of the D-League, also playing abroad with Russia's Unics Kazan and Greece's Panionios BC. In 2008, he played with the Denver Nuggets in their pre-season, but was waived before the October 29 tip-off.\n\nOn March 14, 2010, it was announced that Cleaves had joined Fox Sports Detroit as a Detroit Pistons studio analyst. In addition Cleaves has branched out into music as an owner of the record label All Varsity Entertainment, featuring Jon Connor.\n\nIn October 2015, Cleaves was investigated for his role in an alleged sexual assault. Cleaves was accused of taking a 24-year-old woman to a motel in Mundy Township, on September 15, 2015, keeping her against her will and sexually assaulting her. He was released on a $150,000 personal bond. The case was handled by Wayne County because Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton had a conflict of interest.\n\nOn December 5, 2016, after reviewing surveillance video and the alleged victim’s testimony, all charges against Cleaves were dismissed by District Court Judge M. Cathy Dowd. Prosecutors promptly appealed. On April 10, 2017, Genesee Circuit Court Judge Archie L. Hayman ruled that District Court Judge M. Cathy Dowd abused her discretion in finding no probable cause that Cleaves committed a crime, remanding the case to district court and ordering it bound over for a jury trial. On May 16, 2017, Cleaves' attorneys appealed the decision to the Michigan Court of Appeals, arguing that Judge Hayman \"ignored the evidence of the case.\" On August 1, 2017, it was announced three Michigan Court of Appeals judges denied Cleaves' request to review a judge's decision to reinstate sexual assault charges against him. On January 4, 2018, it was announced that the Michigan Supreme Court declined to review a judge's decision to reinstate sexual assault charges against Cleaves. In August 2019, the case returned to county court for trial, and on August 20, 2019, Cleaves was acquitted of all charges. A video published on the Internet shows the woman attempting to resist him as he pulls her back to the hotel room. Cleaves attorney Frank J. Manley released a statement saying that Cleaves was doing the right thing by pulling a naked woman back into the hotel room and allowed her to leave when fully dressed. Manley also stated that Cleaves' case was dismissed previously by a female judge who heard all the evidence and he was acquitted by a jury that had 9 out 12 jurors who were female. Further, the accuser also stated to officers that she had not been raped the night of the alleged assault, admitted to kissing Cleaves, was on camera fixing her hair and make up before entering the hotel with him, and asked him for football tickets shortly after the night of the alleged sexual assault.\n\n"}
{"id": "2138126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138126", "title": "China Western Development", "text": "China Western Development\n\nChina Western Development (), also Great Western Development Strategy or the Open Up the West Program, is a policy adopted for the western regions.\n\nThe policy covers 6 provinces (Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan), 5 autonomous regions (Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet and Xinjiang), and 1 municipality (Chongqing). This region contains 71.4% of mainland China's area, but only 28.8% of its population, as of the end of 2002, and 19.9% of its total economic output, as of 2015.\n\nUnder the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the People's Republic of China began to reform its economy in 1978 by changing from a command economy to a market economy. The coastal regions of eastern China benefited greatly from these reforms, and their economies quickly raced ahead. The western half of China, however, lagged behind severely. In March 1999, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin proposed a developmental strategy for the western region at the Ninth National People's Congress. He would elaborate on the plan in June 1999, during which the phrase \"great western development\" was used, marking the start of the policy. Premier Zhu Rongji visited the western region to gather western officials' views of the plan. Consequently, the State Planning Commission drafted an early plan for the proposal before submitting it to the Politburo Standing Committee in November 1999. A Leadership Group for Western China Development (西部地区开发领导小组) was created by the State Council in January 2000, led by Zhu.\n\n\nThe main components of the strategy include the development of infrastructure (transport, hydropower plants, energy, and telecommunications), enticement of foreign investment, increased efforts on ecological protection (such as reforestation), promotion of education, and retention of talent flowing to richer provinces. As of 2006, a total of 1 trillion yuan has been spent building infrastructure in western China.\n\nThe western development bureau affiliated to the state council released a list of 10 major projects to launch in 2008, with a combined budget of 436 billion yuan (64.12 billion U.S. dollars).\n\nThese projects included new railway lines connecting Guiyang and Guangzhou, Lanzhou and Chongqing, Kashgar and Hotan in Xinjiang; highways between Wanyuan and Dazhou in Sichuan Province, Shuikou and Duyun in Guizhou Province; airport expansion projects in Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi’an.\n\nThey also include the building of hydropower stations, coal mines, gas and oil transmission tube lines as well as public utilities projects in western regions.\n\nBy the end of 2007, China has started 92 key construction projects in western regions, with a total investment of more than 1.3 trillion yuan. The world-known Qinghai-Tibet railway project set a milestone in Tibet's local development. It connected Tibet with central part of China. Tibet is no longer an isolated area that can not reached by railway. \n\nThe Big Western Line, a possible element of the South–North Water Transfer Project, is a proposal for diverting water from the upstream sections of six rivers in southwestern China, including the Mekong, the Yarlung Tsangpo and the Salween, to the dry areas of northern China through a system of reservoirs, tunnels and natural rivers. This project may be the most controversial plan to date.\n\nChina’s attempt to develop its western regions has had varying effects on the West’s economic development. While massive investment has boosted the region’s output, effectively raising the GDP in all western regions, the project failed to achieve its goal of eliminating the economic gap between China’s East and West.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Xinjiang and Guangxi displayed an annual GDP percent increase of as high as 30%. China's western regions have reported an annual average economic growth rate of 10.6% for six years in a row. The combined GDP of the western regions reached 3.33 trillion yuan in 2005, compared with 1.66 trillion yuan in 2000, while net income grew on average 10% for urban residents in the west and 6.8% for rural residents. Initiatives encouraging Chinese from wealthier and more crowded regions of China to move to the less crowded western regions has resulted in population growth in [a few cities], most notably Qinghai with its increase of 12.6%.\n\nNevertheless, the economic growth rate of China’s East continues to exceed that of the West, causing the western share of domestic product to continue to fall. The West’s contribution to the GDP decreased from 20.88% in 1990 to 17.13% in 2000. Relative levels of GDP per capita in the West decreased from 73.30% in 1990 to 60.87% in 2000. In 1990, Shanghai’s per capita GDP was 7.3 times that of Guizhou, the poorest province in China; by 2000, the figure had grown to 12.9 times. Evidence from the China Statistical Yearbook also confirms the increasing economic gap between China’s West and East, indicating that the east-to-west GDP ratio increased from 2.98 in 1980 to 4.33 in 2000.\n\nSince the introduction of economic reform and open-door policy in 1978, the western region has been in a disadvantageous economic position because it promises a less lucrative return to the investors than its eastern competitors. Therefore, one of the major objectives of the Open Up the West initiative was to bring in foreign investment by creating a more stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. This was a success for the western development project at some level, for statistics shows a substantial growth in foreign investment in the western regions, from US $1,837.35 million in 1999 to $1,922.19 million in 2001. However, not all areas in the western region shared in this progress. While foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew US $17.56 million between 1999 and 2001 (from US $238.93 million to $256.49 million), foreign investment in Guizhou, Guangxi and Ningxi declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.\nThe situation in Guizhou reveals a particularly pernicious effect of the Western Development Program. Despite the fact that Guizhou received 53.3 billion yuan in infrastructure construction in 2001 alone, more than the total amount given by the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1995-2000), its foreign capital declined from US $40.9 million in 1999 to $29.29 million in 2001, an astonishing 31% decline, reaching its lowest point since 1997. Contrary to what the state had intended, the West-East Electricity Transfer Project in Guizhou only assured the continued increase in foreign investment on the coast, as most of the electricity generated in Guizhou was transmitted to Guangdong.\n\nTim Oakes, associate professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder, argues that the decline of foreign investment in certain western regions is a consequence of Beijing’s attempt to recentralize the province’s economy through mega-projects such as Guizhou’s west-east electricity transfer project. The strengthening of central control over the economy has eroded the trust of foreign investors. In the case of Guizhou, while the Chinese central government intended to attract foreign investment in the power sector through the West-East Electricity Transfer Project, only 5% of foreign investment entered the energy sector. About 75% of Guizhou’s foreign investment was channeled into manufacturing and 15% to real estate development. Because the campaign’s economic program is strongly central planned, the campaign has actually discouraged foreign investment, working against its original intent.\n\nForeseeing significant environmental impacts in the massive infrastructure development program, the state highly publicizes environmental preservation in its campaign to open up the West. Farmland conversion to forest and grassland is the dominant strategy for this effort, targeting specifically the regions crucial to the Yangtze’s protection. In Sichuan, the government aims to protect the 19.23 million hectares of existing forest and plant an additional 2.93 million hectares of new forest to diminish the amount of silt flowing into the Yangtze. Around 20,000 mu of farmland was converted in Guizhou in 2001, a key region for Yangtze preservation. In Shaanxi, 571,000 hectares of farmland and 427,000 hectares of wasteland were converted to forest or grass between 1999 and 2002. Another 280,000 hectares of farmland and the same expanse of wasteland were converted in 2003. China’s environmental program in the west has made China “one of a few countries in the world that have been rapidly increasing their forest cover,” according to David Dollar, director of the World Bank in China.\n\nAlthough the project seems to be going successfully, it creates a potential fiscal burden for the government. Massive farmland conversion requires a tremendous amount of funding for resettling the farmers. In addition, to compensate farmers for their loss in agricultural profit, the state has committed to supplying them with grains and funds for planting trees and grass. This results in a prescribed allotment of 60 yuan per mu by the central policy. A further complication is farmer dissatisfaction when the government fails to deliver on its contract, since the local government usually bases compensation on actual production value, resulting in compensation between 20-50 yuan, plus a 300 jin appropriation of grain.\n\nFarmers who are temporarily benefiting from the compensation will soon rely on governmental subsidy once the tree-planting project is completed. 81,000 tons of grain, 154 million yuan in cash subsidies and 266 million yuan for tree saplings to almost 800,000 farming households have already been spent in Shaanxi. If the provincial government decides to honor its commitment for another 5–8 years, it will cost a total of 11.7 billion yuan in grain and cash subsidies. The heavy financial cost makes the sustainability of the environmental project questionable.\n\nFurthermore, while the environmental project is critically emphasized in the campaign, very little has been discussed on the impact of intensified coal extraction, increased thermal plant operation, reservoir inundation, and transportation and transmission line construction, all of which create a more detrimental impact to the environment that the environmental program can compensate for.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was intended as an international system of phonetic transcription for oral languages, originally for pedagogical purposes. The Association was established in Paris in 1886 by French and British language teachers led by Paul Passy. The prototype of the alphabet appeared in . The Association based their alphabet upon the Romic alphabet of Henry Sweet, which in turn was based on the Phonotypic Alphabet of Isaac Pitman and the Palæotype of Alexander John Ellis.\n\nThe alphabet has undergone a number of revisions during its history, the most significant being the one put forth at the Kiel Convention in 1989. Changes to the alphabet are proposed and discussed in the Association's organ, \"Journal of the International Phonetic Association\", previously known as \"Le Maître Phonétique\" and before that as \"The Phonetic Teacher\", and then put to a vote by the Association's Council.\n\nThe extensions to the IPA for disordered speech were created in 1990, with its first major revision approved in 2016.\n\nThe International Phonetic Association was founded in Paris in 1886 under the name \"Dhi Fonètik Tîtcerz' Asóciécon\" (The Phonetic Teachers' Association), a development of \"L'Association phonétique des professeurs d'Anglais\" (\"The English Teachers' Phonetic Association\"), to promote an international phonetic alphabet, designed primarily for English, French, and German, for use in schools to facilitate acquiring foreign pronunciation.\n\nOriginally the letters had different phonetic values from language to language. For example, English was transcribed with and French with .\n\nAs of May and November 1887, the alphabets were as follows:\n\nIn the August–September 1888 issue of its journal, the Phonetic Teachers' Association published a standardized alphabet intended for transcription of multiple languages, reflecting its members' consensus that only one set of alphabet ought to be used for all languages, along with a set of six principles:\n\nThe principles would govern all future development of the alphabet, with the exception of #5 and in some cases #2, until they were revised drastically in 1989. #6 has also been loosened, as diacritics have been admitted for limited purposes.\n\nThe devised alphabet was as follows. The letters marked with an asterisk were \"provisional shapes\", which were meant to be replaced \"when circumstances will allow\".\n\nDuring the 1890s, the alphabet was expanded to cover sounds of Arabic and other non-European languages which did not easily fit the Latin alphabet.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 1900s, the Association published a series of booklets outlining the specifications of the alphabet in several languages, the first being a French edition published in 1900. In the book, the chart appeared as follows:\n\nInitially, the charts were arranged with laryngeal sounds on the left and labial ones on the right, following the convention of Alexander Melville Bell's Visible Speech. Vowels and consonants were placed in a single chart, reflecting how sounds ranged in openness from stops (top) to open vowels (bottom). The voiced velar fricative was represented by (distinct from , which represents a plosive) since 1895 until it was replaced by in 1900. too would be replaced by in 1931.\n\nNot all letters, especially those in the fricatives row which included both fricatives in the modern sense and approximants, were self-explanatory and could only be discerned in the notes following the chart, which redefined letters using the orthographies of languages wherein the sounds they represent occur. For example:\n\nNasalized vowels were marked with a tilde: , , etc. It was noted that may be used for \"any vowel of obscure and intermediate quality found in weak syllables\". A long sound was distinguished by trailing . Stress may be marked by before the stressed syllable, as necessary, and the Swedish and Norwegian 'compound tone' (double tone) with before the syllable.\n\nA voiced sound was marked by and a voiceless one by . Retroflex consonants were marked by , as in . Arabic emphatic consonants were marked by : . Consonants accompanied by a glottal stop (ejectives) were marked by : . Tense and lax vowels were distinguished by acute and grave accents: \"naught\" , \"not\" . Non-syllabic vowels were marked by a breve, as in , and syllabic consonants by an acute below, as in . Following letters, stood for advanced tongue, for retracted tongue, for more open, for more close, for more rounded, and for more spread. It was also noted that a superscript letter may be used to indicate a tinge of that sound in the sound represented by the preceding letter, as in .\n\nIt was emphasized, however, that such details need not usually be repeated in transcription. The equivalent part of the 1904 English edition said:\n\n[I]t must remain a general principle to \"leave out everything self-evident, and everything that can be explained once for all\". This allows us to dispense almost completely with the modifiers, and with a good many other signs, except in scientific works and in introductory explanations. We write English \"fill\" and French \"fil\" the same way ; yet the English vowel is 'wide' and the French 'narrow', and the English is formed much further back than the French. If we wanted to mark these differences, we should write English , French . But we need not do so: we know, once for all, that English short is always , and French always ; that English is always and French always .\n\nIn the 1904 \"Aim and Principles of the International Phonetic Association\", the first of its kind in English, the chart appeared as:\n\nIn comparison to the 1900 chart, the glottal stop appeared as a modifier letter rather than a full letter , replaced , and replaced . were removed from the chart and instead only mentioned as having \"been suggested for a Circassian dental hiss [sibilant] and its voiced correspondent\". is suggested for the Bantu labialized sibilant, and as a diacritic to mark click consonants. It is noted that some prefer iconic to , and that and are unsatisfactory letters.\n\nLaryngeal consonants had also been moved around, reflecting little understanding about the mechanisms of laryngeal articulations at the time. and () were defined as the Arabic and .\n\nIn the notes, the half-length mark is now mentioned, and it is noted that whispered sounds may be marked with a diacritical comma, as in . A syllabic consonant is now marked by a vertical bar, as in , rather than . It is noted, in this edition only, that \"shifted vowels\" may be indicated: for in-mixed or in-front, and for out-back.\n\nFollowing 1904, sets of specifications in French appeared in 1905 and 1908, with little to no changes. In 1912, the second English booklet appeared. For the first time, labial sounds were shown on the left and laryngeal ones on the right:\n\nFor the first time, affricates, or [a]ssibilated' consonant groups, i. e. groups in which the two elements are so closely connected that the whole might be treated as a single sound\", were noted as able to be represented with a tie bar, as in . Palatalized consonants could be marked by a dot above the letter, as in , \"suggesting the connexion with the sounds i and j\".\n\nThe 1921 \"Écriture phonétique internationale\" introduced new letters, some of which were never to be seen in any other booklet:\n\nThe book also mentioned letters \"already commonly used in special works\", some of which had long been part of the IPA but others which \"have not yet been definitively adopted\":\n\n\nIt also introduced several new suprasegmental specifications:\n\n\nIt recommended the use of a circumflex for the Swedish grave accent, as in (\"the spirit\"). It was mentioned that some authors prefer in place of . Aspiration was marked as and stronger aspiration as .\n\nThe click letters were conceived by Daniel Jones. In 1960, A. C. Gimson wrote to a colleague:\n\nPaul Passy recognized the need for letters for the various clicks in the July–August 1914 number of \"Le Maître Phonétique\" and asked for suggestions. This number, however, was the last for some years because of the war. During this interval, Professor Daniel Jones himself invented the four letters, in consultation with Paul Passy and they were all four printed in the pamphlet \"L'Écriture Phonétique Internationale\" published in 1921. The letters were thus introduced in a somewhat unusual way, without the explicit consent of the whole Council of the Association. They were, however, generally accepted from then on, and, as you say, were used by Professor Doke in 1923. I have consulted Professor Jones in this matter, and he accepts responsibility for their invention, during the period of the First World War.\n\nThe 1921 book was the first in the series to mention the word \"phoneme\" (\"phonème\").\n\nIn April 1925, 12 linguists led by Otto Jespersen, including IPA Secretary Daniel Jones, attended a conference in Copenhagen and proposed specifications for a standardized system of phonetic notation. The proposals were largely dismissed by the members of the IPA Council. Nonetheless, the following additions recommended by the Conference were approved in 1927:\n\n\nIn 1928, the following letters were adopted:\n\n\nThe following letters, which had appeared in earlier editions, were repeated or formalized:\n\nAn updated chart appeared as a supplement to \"Le Maître Phonétique\" in 1932.\n\nThe vowels were now arranged in a right-angled trapezium as opposed to an isosceles trapezium, reflecting Daniel Jones's development of the Cardinal Vowel theory. A practically identical chart—with the exception of —in German had appeared in . The substitution of for was approved in 1931.\n\nThe accompanying notes read:\n\n.—Palatalized consonants: , etc. Velarized or pharyngealized consonants: , etc. Ejective consonants (plosives with simultaneous glottal stop): , etc. Implosive voiced consonants: , etc. fricative trill.

They were:\n\n\nThe word \"plosives\" in the description of ejectives and the qualifier \"slightly\" in the definitions of were removed.\n\nThe 1949 \"Principles of the International Phonetic Association\" was the last installment in the series until it was superseded by the \"Handbook of the IPA\" in 1999. It introduced some new specifications:\n\n\nNone of these specifications were inherited in the subsequent charts. was defined as an indicator of \"medium stress\".\n\nIn 1948, and were approved as typographic alternatives, while it was also acknowledged that may be used for a velar plosive and for an advanced one in narrow transcription of a language where it is preferable to distinguish the two, such as Russian. The 1949 \"Principles\" recommended this alternation of the letters but did not mention their typographic equivalency in other languages. Nevertheless, the recommendation was hardly adopted, not even by , who used and .\n\nThe 1951 chart added as yet another alternative to an r-coloured , following its approval in 1950. Conceived by John S. Kenyon, the letter was in itself a combination of and the hook for retroflex consonants approved by the IPA in 1927. Since its introduction in 1935, the letter was widely adopted by American linguists and the IPA had been asked to recognize it as part of the alphabet.\n\nIn 1979, a revised chart appeared, incorporating the developments in the alphabet which were made earlier in the decade:\n\nThe following changes were approved in 1976:\n\n\nOn the same occasion, the following letters and diacritics were removed because they had \"fallen into disuse\":\n\n\nOn the other hand, for the close-mid central unrounded vowel, for the open-mid central rounded vowel, and for the open central unrounded vowel were proposed but rejected. The proposal of was based on . for the voiced palatal fricative and for creaky voice were proposed but the votes were inconclusive.\n\nIn the 1979 chart, , previously defined as \"lowered varieties of \", appeared slightly centered rather than simply midway between and as they did in the 1912 chart. , the predecessors to , were acknowledged as alternatives to under the section \"Other symbols\". appeared as the rounded counterpart to rather than between and .\n\nThe name of the column \"Dental and alveolar\" was changed to \"Dental, alveolar, or post-alveolar\". \"Pharyngeal\", \"trill\", \"tap or flap\", and \"approximant\" replaced \"\", \"rolled\", \"flapped\", and \"frictionless continuants\", respectively. , which were listed twice in both the fricative and frictionless continuant rows in the previous charts, now appeared as an approximant and a fricative, respectively, while the line between the rows was erased, indicating certain fricative letters may represent approximants and vice versa, with the employment of the raised and lowered diacritics if necessary. , previously defined as \"voiceless \", was specified as a fricative. remained listed twice in the fricative and approximant rows. , previously defined merely as \"a sound between and \", was redefined as an alveolar lateral flap, in keeping with the use for which it had been originally approved, \"a sound between l and d\".\n\nBy the 1980s, phonetic theories had developed so much since the inception of the alphabet that the framework of it had become outdated. To resolve this, at the initiative of IPA President Peter Ladefoged, approximately 120 members of the IPA gathered at a convention held in Kiel, West Germany, in August 1989, to discuss revisions of both the alphabet and the principles it is founded upon. It was at this convention that it was decided that the \"Handbook of the IPA\" be written and published to supersede the 1949 \"Principles\".\n\nIn addition to the revisions of the alphabet, two workgroups were set up, one on computer coding of IPA characters and computer representation of individual languages, and the other on pathological speech and voice quality. The former group concluded that each IPA character should be assigned a three-digit number for computer coding known as IPA Number, which was published in . The latter devised a set of recommendations for the transcription of disordered speech based on the IPA known as the Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet or extIPA, which was published in 1990 and adopted by the International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association, which now maintains it, in 1994.\n\nA drastically renewed chart of the alphabet reflecting decisions made at the convention appeared later in the year. Additions were:\n\n\nTone, which had been indicated with an iconic line preceding the syllable or above or below the vowel, was now written one of two ways: with a similar iconic line following the syllable and anchored to a vertical bar, as in (Chao's tone letters), or with more abstract diacritics written over the vowel (acute = high, macron = mid, grave = low), which could be compounded with each other, as in .\n\nThe palato-alveolar column was removed and were listed alongside the postalveolars. appeared at the same horizontal position as the other alveolars rather than slightly more back as did in the previous charts. was specified as a trill rather than either a trill or flap. The alternative raised and lowered diacritics were eliminated in favour of , which could now be attached to consonants to denote fricative or approximant, as in . Diacritics for relative articulation placed next to, rather than below, a letter, namely , were no longer mentioned. The diacritic for no audible release was finally mentioned in the chart.\n\nAt the convention, proposals such as for a voiced labial–velar fricative, for a voiceless velar lateral fricative, for a voiced velar lateral fricative, for a voiceless palatal lateral fricative, for \"the 'hissing-hussing' fricatives of some Caucasian languages\", and for an open central unrounded vowel were discussed but dismissed.\n\nThe six principles set out in 1888 were replaced by a much longer text consisting of seven paragraphs. The first two paragraphs established the alphabet's purpose, namely to be \"a set of symbols for representing all the possible sounds of the world's languages\" and \"representing fine distinctions of sound quality, making the IPA well suited for use in all disciplines in which the representation of speech sounds is required\". The second paragraph also said, \" is a shorthand way of designating the intersection of the categories voiceless, bilabial, and plosive; is the intersection of the categories voiced, bilabial, and nasal; and so on\", refining the previous, less clearly defined principle #2 with the application of the distinctive feature theory. Discouragement of diacritics was relaxed, though recommending their use be limited: \"(i) For denoting length, stress and pitch. (ii) For representing minute shades of sounds. (iii) When the introduction of a single, diacritic obviates the necessity for designing a number of new symbols (as, for instance, in the representation of nasalized vowels)\". The principles also adopted the recommendation of enclosing phonetic transcriptions in square brackets [ ] and phonemic ones in slashes / /, a practice that emerged in the 1940s. The principles were reprinted in the 1999 \"Handbook\".\n\nFollowing the 1989 revision, a number of proposals for revisions appeared in the \"Journal of the IPA\", which were submitted to the Council of the IPA. In 1993, the Council approved the following changes:\n\n\nOn the same occasion, it was reaffirmed that and are typographic alternatives.\n\nThe revised chart was now portrait-oriented. and were moved to the centerline of the vowel chart, indicating that they are not necessarily unrounded. The word \"voiced\" was removed from the definition for , now simply \"epiglottal plosive\". \"Other symbols\" and diacritics were slightly rearranged. The outer stroke of the letter for a bilabial click was modified from a circle with a consistent width to the shape of uppercase O.\n\nIn 1996, it was announced that the form of the open-mid central rounded vowel in the 1993 chart, , was a typographical error and should be changed to , stating the latter was the form that \"J. C. Catford had in mind when he proposed the central vowel changes ... in 1990\", also citing and , who had . However, the letter Catford had proposed for the value in 1990 was in fact (a barred ), with an alternative being , but not . Errata for appeared in 1992, but the printed form was again and the errata even acknowledged that was included in , as pointed out by David Abercrombie.\n\nIn the updated chart, which was published in the front matter of the 1999 \"Handbook of the IPA\", the subsections were rearranged so that the left edge of the vowel chart appeared right beneath the palatal column, hinting at the palatal place of articulation for , as did in all pre-1989 charts, though the space did not allow the back vowels to appear beneath the velars. A tie bar placed below letters, as in , was mentioned again. was now attached to the preceding letter, as in . A few illustrations in the chart were changed: was added for rhoticity, and were replaced with . The examples of \"high rising\" and \"low rising\" tone contours were changed from (4–5) and (1–2) to (3–5) and (1–3), respectively. The word \"etc.\" was dropped from the list of contours, though the 1999 \"Handbook\" would continue to use contours that did not appear on the chart.\n\nThe 1999 \"Handbook of the International Phonetic Association\" was the first book outlining the specifications of the alphabet in 50 years, superseding the 1949 \"Principles of the IPA\". It consisted of just over 200 pages, four times as long as the \"Principles\". In addition to what was seen in the 1996 chart, the book included for mid central vowel release, for voiceless dental fricative release, and for voiceless velar fricative release as part of the official IPA in the \"Computer coding of IPA symbols\" section. The section also included for a voiced retroflex implosive, noting it was \"not explicitly IPA approved\". The book also said \"might be used\" for \"a secondary reduction of the lip opening accompanied by neither protrusion nor velar constriction\". It abandoned the 1949 \"Principles\" recommendation of alternating and for ordinary and advanced velar plosives, and acknowledged both shapes as acceptable variants.\n\nIn 2005, was added for the labiodental flap.\n\nIn 2011, it was proposed that be added to represent the open central unrounded vowel, but this was declined by the Council the following year.\n\nIn 2012, the IPA chart and its subparts were released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\nIn 2016, three versions of a revised chart dated 2015 were released online, each with the characters rendered in a different typeface (IPA Kiel/LS Uni developed by Linguist's Software, Doulos SIL, and DejaVu Sans). No character was added or withdrawn, but some notes and the shapes of a few were slightly modified. In particular, was replaced by , with a continuous, slanted stroke, and the example of a \"rising–falling\" tone contour was changed from (4–5–4) to (3–4–3).\n\nIn 2018, another slightly modified chart in different fonts was released, this time also in TeX TIPA Roman developed by Rei Fukui, which was selected as best representing the IPA symbol set by the Association's Alphabet, Charts and Fonts committee, established the previous year. The example of a \"rising–falling\" tone contour was again changed from (3–4–3) to (3–4–2).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2138170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138170", "title": "Colors (film)", "text": "Colors (film)\n\nColors is a 1988 American police procedural action crime film starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall, and directed by Dennis Hopper. The film takes place in the gang ridden neighborhoods of Los Angeles: late-1980s' South Central Los Angeles, Echo Park, Westlake and East Los Angeles. The film centers on Bob Hodges (Duvall), an experienced Los Angeles Police Department C.R.A.S.H. officer, and his rookie partner, Danny McGavin (Penn), who try to stop the gang violence between the Bloods, the Crips, and Hispanic street gangs. \"Colors\" relaunched Hopper as a director 19 years after \"Easy Rider\", and inspired discussion over its depiction of gang life and gang violence.\n\nTwo white cops, Bob \"Uncle Bob\" Hodges, a respected 19-year LAPD officer and Vietnam veteran, and rookie officer Danny McGavin have just been teamed together in the C.R.A.S.H. unit that patrols Northwest L.A., East L.A. and South Central L.A.\n\nThe older cop is appreciated on the local streets. He is diplomatic on the surface, preaching \"rapport\" to gang members to encourage them to offer help when it is truly needed and recognizes that every action cops take is scrutinized by the very people they are trying to help. Hodges explains his view on policing to his young partner with a joke about bulls and cows. \n\nAlthough the pair bond quickly, life lessons are seemingly lost on the aggressive, cavalier McGavin, whose stunted actions soon bring him quick notoriety with the local gang members and the people themselves, such as attacking a graffiti \"artist\" by spraying his eyes with the paint can. When McGavin wrecks their first unmarked car during a pursuit, its replacement, painted a vivid yellow, results in McGavin being nicknamed \"Pac-Man\" by officers and gang members alike.\n\nMcGavin also has a short lived romance with a waitress named Louisa who, like the offended Hodges, feels the weight of the Pac-Man persona. Amidst the strains of these relationships, the murder of a Bloods gang member leads to a series of escalations between two other street gangs. A series of seemingly random incidents culminates in a plot that finds the two partners in the middle of the Crips, Bloods and Hispanic Barrio war. \n\nThe 21st Street Gang, led by a criminal named Frog, attempts to negotiate a peace similar to Hodges and steer clear of the melee. To protect his partner, Hodges unwittingly exposes Frog as his source on the Crips leader Rocket with his scheme to kill McGavin. Each group attempts to right the wrongs against their respective crews as police work to prevent the hit and stand their authority over the fall out.\n\nIn the end, the unit moves in on the would-be last crew standing—the 21st Street Gang. While arresting Frog, Hodges is fatally shot by a gunman trying to enact the hit on McGavin. With medics en route, McGavin comforts Hodges and breaks down with regret as the elder partner falls into delirium and dies.\n\nSometime later, a more reserved McGavin has a rookie partner, a black cop who grew up in the neighborhood where they patrol and sports an attitude similar to the \"Pac-Man\". McGavin tells him the same joke about the bulls that Hodges taught him, and the younger officer reciprocates in the same way as the younger McGavin did. The film ends with McGavin considering the cycle as the pair drive on and continue their patrol.\n\nThe movie was filmed entirely in Los Angeles in 1987. The original script by Richard Di Lello took place in Chicago and was more about drug dealing than gang members. Dennis Hopper ordered changes, so Michael Schiffer was hired and the setting was changed to Los Angeles and the focus of the story became more about the world of gang members.\n\nThe joke that Hodges tells McGavin regarding the two bulls was lifted from the Pat Conroy novel \"The Great Santini\" (which was made into a movie that also starred Duvall) and explains how the character Lt. Col. \"Bull\" Meechum got his nickname.\n\nReal gang members were hired as guardians as well as actors by producer Robert H. Solo. Two of them were shot during filming.\n\nOn April 2, 1987, Sean Penn was arrested for punching an extra on the set of this film who was taking photos of him without permission. Penn was sentenced to 33 days in jail for this assault.\n\nA soundtrack containing mainly hip hop music was released on April 15, 1988, by Warner Bros. Records. It peaked at 31 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified gold on July 12, 1988.\n\nThe movie received both praise and criticism. The film currently has an 82% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews, with the consensus; \"\"Colors\" takes a hard-hitting yet nuanced look at urban gang violence, further elevated by strong performances from a pair of well-matched leads.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" stated that it \"has a superb eye for the poisonous flowering of gang culture amid ghetto life, and an ear to match; along with brilliant cinematography by Haskell Wexler, it's also got a fierce, rollicking sense of motion.\" \n\nRoger Ebert hailed it as \"a special movie – not just a police thriller, but a movie that has researched gangs and given some thought to what it wants to say about them.\" \n\n\"The Washington Post\"'s critics, Desson Howe and Hal Hinson were split, with Howe stating that Hopper \"covers the mayhem with unadorned, documentary immediacy that transcends otherwise formulaic cop-fare\" and Hinson stating that it \"must be the least incendiary film about gang life ever made.\" \n\nOne of the more negative reviews of the film appeared on the BBC's Ceefax service, on which critic Louise Hart remarked: \"The main weakness of the film is that it concentrates far less on the street gangs than on the growing relationship between the two cops.\"\n\nThe movie earned over $46 million in its domestic release.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2138187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138187", "title": "Acute coronary syndrome", "text": "Acute coronary syndrome\n\nAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a syndrome (set of signs and symptoms) due to decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries such that part of the heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, crushing, central and associated with nausea and sweating. Many people with acute coronary syndromes present with symptoms other than chest pain, particularly, women, older patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome is commonly associated with three clinical manifestations, named according to the appearance of the electrocardiogram (ECG): ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or unstable angina (38%). There can be some variation as to which forms of myocardial infarction (MI) are classified under acute coronary syndrome.\n\nACS should be distinguished from \"stable\" angina, which develops during physical activity or stress and resolves at rest. In contrast with stable angina, unstable angina occurs suddenly, often at rest or with minimal exertion, or at lesser degrees of exertion than the individual's previous angina (\"crescendo angina\"). New-onset angina is also considered unstable angina, since it suggests a new problem in a coronary artery.\n\nThe cardinal symptom of critically decreased blood flow to the heart is chest pain, experienced as tightness around or over the chest and (often, but not always) radiating to the left arm and the left angle of the jaw. This may be associated with diaphoresis (sweating), nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness of breath. In many cases, the sensation is \"atypical\", with pain experienced in different ways or even being completely absent (which is more likely in female patients and those with diabetes). Some may report palpitations, anxiety or a sense of impending doom (angor animi) and a feeling of being acutely ill. The description of the chest discomfort as a pressure has little utility in aiding a diagnosis as it is not specific for ACS.\n\nThough ACS is usually associated with coronary thrombosis, it can also be associated with cocaine use. Chest pain with features characteristic of cardiac origin (angina) can also be precipitated by profound anemia, brady- or tachycardia (excessively slow or rapid heart rate), low or high blood pressure, severe aortic valve stenosis (narrowing of the valve at the beginning of the aorta), pulmonary artery hypertension and a number of other conditions.\n\nIn those who have ACS, atheroma rupture is most commonly found 60% when compared to atheroma erosion (30%), thus causes the formation of thrombus which block the coronary arteries. Plaque rupture is responsible for 60% in ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) while plaque erosion is responsible for 30% if the STEMI and vice versa for Non ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In plaque rupture, the content of the plaque are lipid rich, collagen poor, with abundant inflammation which is macrophage predominant, and covered with a thin fibrous cap. Meanwhile, in plaque erosion, the plaque is rich with extracellular matrix, proteoglycan, glycoaminoglycan, but without fibrous caps, no inflammatory cells, and no large lipid core. After the coronary arteries are unblocked, there is a risk of reperfusion injury due spreading inflammatory mediators throughout the body. Investigations is still underway on the role of Cyclophilin D in reducing the reperfusion injury.\n\nIn the setting of acute chest pain, the electrocardiogram is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the \"ST segment\", new left bundle branch block), treatment for a heart attack in the form of angioplasty or thrombolysis is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, it is not possible to immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI.\n\nAs it is only one of the many potential causes of chest pain, the patient usually has a number of tests in the emergency department, such as a chest X-ray, blood tests (including myocardial markers such as troponin I or T, and H-FABP and/or a D-dimer if a pulmonary embolism is suspected), and telemetry (monitoring of the heart rhythm).\n\nCombination of troponin levels (less than 5 ng/l) with low TIMI scores can help to predict those with low possibility of myocardial infarction and discharge them safely from the emergency department. Coronary CT angiography combined with Troponin levels is also helpful to triage those who are susceptible to ACS. F-fluoride positron emission tomography is also helpful in identifying those with high risk, lipid-rich coronary plaques.\n\nThe ACI-TIPI score can be used to aid diagnosis; using seven variables from the admission record, this score predicts crudely which patients are likely to have myocardial ischemia. For example, according to a randomized controlled trial, males having chest pain with normal or non diagnostic ECG are at higher risk for having acute coronary syndrome than women. In this study, the sensitivity was 65.2% and specificity was 44%. This particular study had an 8.4% prevalence of acute coronary syndrome, which means the positive predictive value of being a male with chest pain and having coronary syndrome is 9.6% and negative predictive value is 93.2% ( click here to adjust these results for patients at higher or lower risk of acute coronary syndrome).\n\nIn a second cohort study, exercise electrocardiography was similarly found to be a poor predictor of acute coronary syndrome at follow-up. Of the patients who had a coronary event at 6 years of follow up, 47% had a negative ECG at the start of the study. With an average follow up of 2.21 years the receiver operating characteristic curves gave resting ECG a score of 0.72 and exercise ECG a score of 0.74.\n\nThere are not only prediction scores for diagnosis of ACS, but also prognosis. Most notably, the GRACE ACS Risk and Mortality score helps diagnose, and based upon that score predicts mortality rate of a given patient. It takes into account both clinical (blood pressure, heart rate, EKG findings) and medical history in its scoring system.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome often reflects a degree of damage to the coronaries by atherosclerosis. Primary prevention of atherosclerosis is controlling the risk factors: healthy eating, exercise, treatment for hypertension and diabetes, avoiding smoking and controlling cholesterol levels; in patients with significant risk factors, aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Secondary prevention is discussed in myocardial infarction.\n\nAfter a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places was introduced in Scotland in March 2006, there was a 17% reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome. 67% of the decrease occurred in non-smokers.\n\nPeople with presumed ACS are typically treated with aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor, nitroglycerin, and if the chest discomfort persists morphine. Other analgesics such as nitrous oxide are of unknown benefit. Angiography is recommended in those who have either new ST elevation or a new left or right bundle branch block on their ECG. Unless the person has low oxygen levels additional oxygen does not appear to be useful.\n\nIf the ECG confirms changes suggestive of myocardial infarction (ST elevations in specific leads, a new left bundle branch block or a true posterior MI pattern), thrombolytics may be administered or primary coronary angioplasty may be performed. In the former, medication is injected that stimulates fibrinolysis, destroying blood clots obstructing the coronary arteries. In the latter, a flexible catheter is passed via the femoral or radial arteries and advanced to the heart to identify blockages in the coronaries. When occlusions are found, they can be intervened upon mechanically with angioplasty and usually stent deployment if a lesion, termed the \"culprit\" lesion, is thought to be causing myocardial damage. Data suggest that rapid triage, transfer and treatment is essential. The time frame for door-to-needle thrombolytic administration according to American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines should be within 30 minutes, whereas the door-to-balloon Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) time should be less than 90 minutes. It was found that thrombolysis is more likely to be delivered within the established ACC guidelines among patients with STEMI as compared to PCI according to a case control study.\n\nIf the ECG does not show typical changes, the term \"non-ST segment elevation ACS\" is applied. The patient may still have suffered a \"non-ST elevation MI\" (NSTEMI). The accepted management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome is therefore empirical treatment with aspirin, a second platelet inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, and heparin (usually a low-molecular weight heparin), with intravenous nitroglycerin and opioids if the pain persists. The heparin-like drug known as fondaparinux appears to be better than enoxaparin.\n\nA blood test is generally performed for cardiac troponins twelve hours after onset of the pain. If this is positive, coronary angiography is typically performed on an urgent basis, as this is highly predictive of a heart attack in the near-future. If the troponin is negative, a treadmill exercise test or a thallium scintigram may be requested.\n\nIf there is no evidence of ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, delaying urgent angioplasty until the next morning is not inferior to doing so immediately. Using statins in the first 14 days after ACS reduces the risk of further ACS.\n\nIn a cohort study comparing NSTEMI and STEMI, people with NSTEMI had a similar risk of death at one year after PCI as compared to people with STEMI (3.4% vs 4.4%). However, NSTEMI had significantly more \"major cardiac events\" (death, myocardial infarction, disabling stroke, or requiring revascularization) at one year (24.0% vs 16.6%).\n\nCocaine-associated ACS should be managed in a manner similar to other patients with acute coronary syndrome except beta blockers should not be used and benzodiazepines should be administered early.\n\nThe TIMI risk score can identify high risk patients in non-ST segment elevation MI ACS and has been independently validated.\n\nBased on a global registry of 102,341 patients, the GRACE score estimates in-hospital, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 year mortality risk after a heart attack. GRACE Score 2.0 Calculator.\n\nThe Killip classification consists of 4 classes based on clinical symptoms. It predicts 30-day mortality after myocardial infarction.\n\nThe aim of diagnostic markers is to identify patients with ACS even when there is no evidence of heart muscle damage.\n\nThe aim of prognostic markers is to reflect different components of pathophysiology of ACS. For example:\n\nStudies have shown that for ACS patients, weekend admission is associated with higher mortality and lower utilization of invasive cardiac procedures, and those who did undergo these interventions had higher rates of mortality and complications than their weekday counterparts. This data leads to the possible conclusion that access to diagnostic/interventional procedures may be contingent upon the day of admission, which may impact mortality. This phenomenon is described as weekend effect.\n\nValvular heart disease is characterized by damage to or defective in one of the four heart valves: the mitral, aortic, tricuspid or pulmonary. Some types of valvular heart disease include valvular stenosis, vascular prolapse and regurgitation.\n\nOral infections may pose risk during postoperative period of heart valve surgery. Oral health in patients scheduled for heart valve surgery is poorer than in individuals without valve disease. Most of them suffer periodontitis due to high dental plaque scores, reflecting poorer dental hygiene. This situation could favour the appearance of bacteremia following tooth brushing in these individuals. Bacteremia secondary to periodontal infection is known to be one of the primary causes of infectious endocarditis, particularly in patient with heart valve disorders. Therefore, treatment of dental disease should be done prior to performing heart surgery. Periodontal treatment is advised in patients with advanced periodontitis, followed by root planing and ultrasound treatment. Those teeth not amenable to treatment and with poor prognosis should be removed as pre-surgical preventive measures.\n\nThe two main concerns during dental treatment for people of patient with valvular heart disease are the risk of infective endocarditis and bleeding in anti coagulated patients. Endocarditis is more likely to occur in patients who have previously had endocarditis and those with certain cardiac lesions. Risk of a normally functioning prosthesis being infected after a dental procedure is probably no higher than risk in patient with damaged native valves. However, mortality and morbidity is much higher should prosthesis become infected. Patient with native valve disease can often stop or reduce their anticoagulants, but those with prosthetic valves should not discontinue anticoagulants without cardiological advice. Mechanical mitral valves are prone to thrombosis, which cause emboli if adequate anti-coagulation is not maintained, although short term modification may be possible.\n\nHeart failure (HF) is defined as the incapacity of the heart to function properly, pumping insufficient blood towards the tissues and leading to fluid accumulation within the lungs, liver and peripheral tissues.\n\n    Most if not all patients with heart failure will be undergoing drug treatments for their condition and these drugs can produce a series of oral manifestation. In this context, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril can produce burning mouth sensation lichenoid reactions and a loss of taste sensation, while diuretics like furosemide can produce xerostomia.\n\n    Consultation with the supervising physician is highly advised in order to understand the patient's current condition and the medication prescribed. The patient should be receiving medical care, and heart failure should be compensated. Dental treatment is to be limited to patients who are in stable condition, since these people are at a high risk of developing questionable arrhythmias and even sudden death secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest. Stress and anxiety are to be avoided during the visits, which in turn should be brief (< 30 minutes) and are to be scheduled for the morning sessions. The patient should be seated on the chair in a semi-supine position, with control of body movements (which should be slow), to avoid orthostatic hypotension. In patients who has been administered with digitalis agents (digoxin, methyl-digoxin), the vasoconstrictor dose should be limited to two anaesthetic carpules, since this drug combination can cause arrhythmias. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) can lead to fluid and sodium retention, and therefore should not be prescribed in patients with heart failure.\n\nIn emergency (i.e., lung edema), after contacting the emergency service, the patient should be seated with the legs lowered, and receiving nasal oxygen at a rate of 4-6 liters/minute. Sublingual nitroglycerin tablets are indicated (0.4-0.8 mg), and the dose may be repeated every 5 or 10 minutes if blood pressure is maintained.\n\nArrhythmias are variations in normal heart rate due to cardiac rhythm, frequency or contraction disorders. The most common type of cardiac arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation.\n\nMany anti-arrhythmic drugs have side effects such as gingival hyperplasia or xerostomia.\n\nConsultation with the supervising physician is also advised in order to understand the patient's current condition and the type of arrhythmia involved, as well as the medication prescribed. It must be checked that the patient uses the medication correctly. Stress and anxiety can be reduced with anxiolytics. Short visits in the morning are to be preferred. Patient monitoring, with recording of the pulse, is indicated before treatment. It is very important to limit the use of vasoconstrictor in local anesthesia, with no more than two carpules. The treatment planned should not be too long or complicated. Although modern pacemakers are more resistant to electromagnetic interferences, caution is required when using electrical devices like ultrasound and electric scalpels that might interfere with pacemakers – especially the older models, since such devices developed in the last 30 years are bipolar and are generally not affected by the small electromagnetic fields generated by dental equipment. It is therefore important to know the type of pacemaker, the degree of electromagnetic protection of the generator, and the nature of the arrhythmia. If arrhythmia develops during dental treatment, the procedure should be suspended, oxygen is to be given, and the patient vital signs are to be assessed: body temperature (normal values: 35.5-37oC), pulse (normal values: 60-100 bpm), respiratory frequency (normal values in adults: 14-20 cycles or respirations per minute), blood pressure (normal values: systolic blood pressure under 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg). Sublingual nitrites are to be administered if there is chest pain.

It is situated on the Mediterranean coast, at the mouth of river Besòs, extending to both sides of the estuary although the original settlement with the parish church lies on the left bank of the river, in the northern part of town. Sant Adrià is the smallest municipality of Barcelonès and has close ties with the neighbouring cities of Barcelona, Badalona and Santa Coloma de Gramenet, forming a uniform urban area within Barcelona metropolitan area.\n\nThe municipality straddles major transportation networks and is served by several modes of public transport. Sant Adrià is currently a town dominated by the service sector, but with a diverse manufacturing sector (especially in the areas of metal-work, chemistry, and construction) consisting mostly of medium-sized companies. Historically, it has experienced several massive migration flows attracted by the important industrialisation of the area during the last century and has been subject of various major urban redevelopments. In 2004, Sant Adrià de Besòs was part of the Universal Forum of Cultures.\n\nThe origins of the town are linked to the parish church of Sant Adrià de Besòs, which was referred to in 1012, where in about 1092 a priory of Augustinian monks, dependants of Sant Ruf d'Avinyo, was founded. Saint Olegarius (San José María de Porcioles) came to this priory from 1095 to 1108 before becoming the bishop of Barcelona and, later, the archbishop of Tarragona. In 1127 the priory was moved to Santa Maria de Terrassa. Surrounding this church, upon a small hill fourteen metres high, to the west of the River Besòs, is the nucleus of the original village.\n\nGiven its proximity to the city of Barcelona, Sant Adrià de Besòs is well served by road, rail and many other forms of public transport, becoming an important part of the transportation network in Barcelona metropolitan area. The city has always been an economically unprivileged town and a really dense area, and it remained indifferent to the establishment and the improvement of public transport around Barcelona for many years, but the recent development in public infrastructures and urban renewals has brought substantial transport improvement, especially in the form of tram services.\n\nC-31 highway comes directly from Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes in Barcelona to Mataró and intersects perpendicularly with Ronda del Litoral (B-10 motorway) in the middle of town, forming a major highway interchange, and allowing B-10 to be linked with Ronda de Dalt (B-20 motorway) at Nus de la Trinitat, another major highway interchange in northern Barcelona. Other main roads serving Sant Adrià include the national route N-II parallel to Maresme's coastline and the local road BV-5001 towards Montornès del Vallès and La Roca del Vallès, crossing the northern part of the municipality.\n\nPublic transportation network is mainly composed of several urban and interurban bus routes that provide a good internal connection within the municipality as well as the connection of the city to other nearby cities within the comarca. Currently, 16 bus routes run through the municipality, 5 of them are local bus routes operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) to and from Barcelona, 8 are interurban routes within Barcelonès, and 3 are night routes. With regard to rail transport modes, Trambesòs is the most prominent transport system in Sant Adrià which comprises 7 stops within the municipality served by all its routes, linking the city to the district of Sant Martí up to Parc de la Ciutadella in Barcelona. Maresme Line also runs through the city with Sant Adrià de Besòs railway station as the only stop of the line in town which lies in the eastern part of Sant Adrià and is served by Rodalies de Catalunya commuter rail line R1. Verneda is the only Barcelona Metro station officially located in the municipality, but Artigues – Sant Adrià station is as its name says also meant to serve Sant Adrià de Besòs because although being located in Badalona, it is just a few meters from the city limits.\n\n\n\n"}

It spent six weeks in the UK album charts, reaching a highest position of No. 44 in June 1980. It contains their best-known song, \"Turning Japanese\", which reached No. 3 in the UK chart in February 1980 and was also a worldwide success. A remix of \"News at Ten\" (named after the well-known ITV news programme), went to No. 44 in July of that year. A third single, a re-recording of \"Waiting for the Weekend\" that included a horn section, failed to chart. The title of the album is a pun on \"Nuclear\", with nuclear weapons and power stations being prominent societal issues at that time. \n\n\"News at Ten\", a cynical examination of the generation gap and the narrator's fear of ending up as complacent as the parent he despises for his conformism, was expected to be a hit on the back of the success of \"Turning Japanese\". Its poorer performance was blamed in part by the long-running strike at the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\", which meant it received very little media exposure. There was also a marked reluctance by BBC Radio 1 - then the nation's premier radio station - to play a song named after an ITV programme.\n\nApart from the three singles, the other best known track is \"Sixty Second Interval\". Its ambiguous lyrics have been interpreted as concerning the short ceasefires agreed upon between armies during wars to allow each to attend to their wounded in the no man's land between them. The song was the inspiration for the long-running \"Sixty Second Interview\" feature of the UK's free \"Metro\" newspaper given away at public transport stations.\n\n\"Letter from Hiro\", the album's lengthy finale, concerns the sense of powerlessness a boy feels as events push towards World War II, and towards the inevitable ending of his friendship with his more patriotic Japanese pen pal (\"And when the sun was rising somewhere in the East, and when a flag meant more to Hiro than to me\"). The song concludes with the playing of a traditional Japanese tune on a cimbalom.\n\nA reflection of the album's title and lyrical content, the album cover shows a grainy television screen displaying a BBC TV weather forecast. Among the symbols for clouds is one located over London that is, on closer examination, a mushroom cloud. In addition, one of the temperature symbols has been replaced with one warning of radiation and the weatherman is glowing.\n\nThe American and Canadian releases omitted both \"Cold War\" and \"America\" in favour of the single \"Prisoners\". The U.S. album was released on CD twice: in 1995 as \"Anthology\", by One Way Records, with four tracks from their second album, \"Magnets\", as bonus tracks; and in 1998 as \"Vaporized\", by Collectables Records, which included the \"Magnets\" album on the same CD.\n\nIn 2000, Captain Mod Records, an offshoot of the Captain Oi! label, specialising in punk rock and new wave bands, reissued both of the band's albums on CD, separately. \"New Clear Days\" featured the original UK LP track listing for the first time on CD, and included all single mixes and B-sides the band recorded for the album as bonus tracks. The CD reissue of \"New Clear Days\" was remastered by Tim Turan and, while some of the bonus tracks had previously been issued on \"Turning Japanese: The Best of the Vapors\" (1996), many of the tracks made their debut on CD for the first time. The booklet included a brief essay on the band's history as well as the lyrics for all the songs on the album.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first grade of polyethylene, produced in 1933 by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) using a high pressure process via free radical polymerization. Its manufacture employs the same method today. The EPA estimates 5.7% of LDPE (recycling number 4) is recycled in the United States. Despite competition from more modern polymers, LDPE continues to be an important plastic grade. In 2013 the worldwide LDPE market reached a volume of about US$33 billion.\n\nLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.917–0.930 g/cm. It is not reactive at room temperatures, except by strong oxidizing agents, and some solvents cause swelling. It can withstand temperatures of 80 °C continuously and for a short time. Made in translucent or opaque variations, it is quite flexible and tough.\n\nLDPE has more branching (on about 2% of the carbon atoms) than HDPE, so its intermolecular forces (instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction) are weaker, its tensile strength is lower, and its resilience is higher. Also, because its molecules are less tightly packed and less crystalline due to the side branches, its density is lower.\n\nWhen exposed to ambient solar radiation the plastic produces two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene. Due to its low density properties (branching) it breaks down more easily over time, leading to higher surface areas. The production of these trace gases from virgin LDPE increase with surface area/time, with rates at the end of a 212-day incubation of 5.8 nmol g-1 d-1 of methane, 14.5 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethylene, 3.9 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethane and 9.7 nmol g-1 d-1 of propylene. When incubated in air, LDPE emits gases at rates ~2 times and ~76 times higher in comparison to water for methane and ethylene, respectively.\n\n\nLDPE is widely used for manufacturing various containers, dispensing bottles, wash bottles, tubing, plastic parts for computer components, and various molded laboratory equipment. Its most common use is in plastic bags. Other products made from it include:\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"aeronomy\" was introduced by Sydney Chapman in a Letter to the Editor of \"Nature\" entitled \"Some Thoughts on Nomenclature\" in 1946. Studies within the subject also investigate the causes of dissociation or ionization processes.\n\nToday the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets. Aeronomy is a branch of atmospheric physics. Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and sounding rockets which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere. Atmospheric tides dominate the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, essential to understanding the atmosphere as a whole. Other phenomena studied are upper-atmospheric lightning discharges, such as red sprites, sprite halos or blue jets.\n\nAtmospheric tides are global-scale periodic oscillations of the atmosphere. In many ways they are analogous to ocean tides. Atmospheric tides form an important mechanism for transporting energy input into the lower atmosphere from the upper atmosphere, while dominating the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Therefore, learning about atmospheric tides is essential in understanding the atmosphere as a whole. Modeling and observations of atmospheric tides are needed in order to monitor and predict changes in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nUpper-atmospheric lightning or upper-atmospheric discharge are terms sometimes used by researchers to refer to a family of electrical-breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal lightning. The preferred current usage is transient luminous events (TLEs) to refer to the various types of electrical-discharge phenomena induced in the upper atmosphere by tropospheric lightning. TLEs includes red sprites, sprite halos, blue jets, and elves.\n\n"}

He is known by Cleveland basketball fans as \"Mr. Cavalier\". He was part of the Notre Dame team which defeated the UCLA Bruins on January 19, 1971, which was UCLA's last defeat until being beaten by Notre Dame exactly three years later, breaking the Bruins' NCAA men's basketball record 88-game winning streak.\n\nCarr grew up in Washington, D.C., and attended Holy Redeemer School, and later Mackin Catholic High School. At Mackin, Carr teamed with All-City guard Tom Little, who made some national All-American teams before starring at the University of Seattle. As a Junior All Met, Carr scored 475 points in 24 games. During Carr's All Met senior season, he scored 600 points and along with Sterling Savoy, led the Paul Furlong coached Trojans to the Catholic League title over DeMatha. Carr was named Parade All-American along with other 1967 seniors such as Artis Gilmore, Howard Porter, Jim McDaniels, and Curtis Rowe, all of whom became major college stars.\n\nThe 6-foot 4-inch (1.93 m), 200 lb (91 kg) shooting guard first came to prominence as a highly recruited player for the University of Notre Dame, arriving after having scored more than 2,000 points during his high school career. Carr lived up to his lofty billing by ending his three-year career at Notre Dame with 2,560 points (an average of 34.5 points per game), ranking him fifth all-time in college basketball history at the time of his departure. During his final two seasons, Carr became only the second college player ever to tally more than 1,000 points in a season, joining Pete Maravich in that select group. Carr holds NCAA tournament records for most points in one game (61 vs. Ohio in 1970), most field goals in one game (25), and most field goals attempted in one game (44). His record scoring average of 50 points per game in seven NCAA playoff games may never be broken. Recently, ESPN named Carr the 22nd greatest college basketball player of all time.\n\nCarr moved onto the professional ranks as the first overall selection of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1971 NBA draft. Carr was also selected in the 1971 ABA Draft by the Virginia Squires, but signed with the Cavaliers on April 5, 1971.\n\nCarr's first season in the NBA was marred by a series of injuries that limited his output. During the 1971 preseason, he broke his foot and missed the first month of the season. Less than one month after returning to the court, he was sidelined again by another foot injury, missing another seven weeks. Upon his return, he began to display the skills which made him the top selection in the NBA draft and was named to the 1972 NBA All-Rookie Team. Following the conclusion of his first season, Carr had surgery to clear up any lingering foot problems.\n\nThe arrival of Lenny Wilkens prior to the start of the 1972–73 campaign gave Carr a solid partner in the backcourt, helping the Cavaliers improve by nine games in the win column. Carr's best season came the following year, when he averaged a career-best 21.9 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game while shooting 85.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nTwo months into the 1974–75 season, he suffered a knee injury that put him out of the lineup indefinitely. His absence in the lineup likely prevented the Cavaliers' from capturing their first-ever playoff berth, with the team's bid falling one game short.\n\nHowever, during the next three seasons, Carr played a role in three straight playoff appearances for the team. Cleveland met the Boston Celtics in the 1976 Eastern Conference finals and lost in six games after defeating the Washington Bullets in the first round of the playoffs . They were eliminated in the first round of the 1977 playoffs by the Washington Bullets in a close three-game series. They were defeated in similar fashion in 1978, losing to the New York Knicks in two games.\n\nCarr played out his final season with the Dallas Mavericks and Washington Bullets before retiring in 1981, finishing with career averages of 15.4 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.\n\nToday, Carr serves as the Director of Community Relations for the Cavaliers and is also a color commentator on the team's broadcasts on Fox Sports Ohio. Carr's #34 is one of seven jerseys retired by the Cavaliers.\n\nIt was announced on April 2, 2007, that Carr was inducted to the second class of the College Basketball Hall of Fame, along with Dick Groat, Dick Barnett and numerous coaches.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, Notre Dame recognized Carr, their all-time leading scorer, during the Pittsburgh – Notre Dame men's basketball game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It currently houses the University's School of Law.\n\nThe house was originally built in 1868 by the architect Alfred Waterhouse and used as his own residence until, in the early 1870s, he moved into an even grander property, Yattendon Court, which he had built in 1867. In the early years of the 20th Century Foxhill was occupied by Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading, who was variously Member of Parliament for Reading, Lord Chief Justice of England, the British ambassador to the United States and Viceroy of India.\n\nIn 1919 Isaacs sold the lease to Hugo Hirst, founder of the General Electric Company Ltd, who in 1934 became Baron Hirst of Witton. Hirst lived in the house until his death in 1943. Subsequently, the house was used by his daughter, Muriel, and her husband Leslie Carr Gamage until about 1958 when the University gained possession.\n\nUsed for a period as student accommodation, Foxhill House was extensively restored between 2003 and 2005, in order to suit its new role as the home of the School of Law. In 2007 the courtyard of the building was refurbished with a grant from PriceWaterhouseCoopers in memory of Edwin Waterhouse, who was both a co-founder of that company and the brother of the building's architect. Foxhill House is a grade II* listed building. The former stables and coach house immediately to the north east, which are now physically connected to Foxhill House, and also form part of the School of Law, are separately listed as Grade II.\n\nFoxhill house was extended in 2009, in order to make room for more offices for academics and teaching staff. Several new teaching rooms were also created. The main extension was created between the main house and the stable block. The rear of the building was given something of a 'conservatory', which created 2 new teaching rooms, as well as a small kitchen area. This 'conservatory' can be seen when looking at the house from the east.\n"}

It replaced the Cape Verdean real at a rate of 1000 réis = 1 escudo. Until 1930, Cape Verde used Portuguese coins, although banknotes were issued by the Banco Nacional Ultramarino specifically for Cape Verde beginning in 1865.\n\nUntil independence in 1975, the Cape Verde escudo was equal to the Portuguese escudo. Subsequently it depreciated, declining by about 30 per cent in 1977-8 and by a further 40 per cent in 1982–84. Thereafter, it remained fairly stable against the Portuguese escudo.\n\nIn mid-1998 an agreement with Portugal established a pegged rate of 1 Portuguese escudo = 0.55 Cape Verdean escudo. Since the replacement of the Portuguese escudo with the euro, the Cape Verdean escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of 1 EUR = 110.265 CVE. This peg is supported by a credit facility from the Portuguese government.\n\nUnder Portuguese rule, coins were introduced in 1930 in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos and 1 escudo. The 5, 10 and 20 centavos were struck in bronze whilst the 50 centavos and 1 escudo were in nickel-bronze. In 1953, bronze 1 escudo, nickel-bronze 2½ escudos and silver 10 escudos were introduced, followed by bronze 50 centavos and nickel-bronze 5 escudos in 1968.\n\nAfter independence, coins were issued in 1977 in denominations of 20 and 50 centavos, 1, 2½, 10, 20 and 50 escudos. The centavo coins were aluminium, the 1 and 2½ escudos were nickel-bronze and the higher denominations were cupro-nickel. As inflation persisted the centavo coins progressively disappeared from circulation and by the time the coinage was revamped the 1 escudo coin was the smallest in circulation. \n\nThe present coinage was introduced in 1994. The smallest was a brass-plated-steel 1 escudo, though the 1 escudo doesn't circulate well and vendors tend to round to the nearest five in practice. This coin comes in only one style, featuring a sea turtle, while the other denominations came with three topical styles. These are the copper-plated-steel 5 escudos, nickel-plated-steel 10, 20 and 50 escudos, and bimetallic, decagonal 100 escudos. The three congruent design series had one featuring native animals (Birds and reptiles), the second was of historical ships with their names included, and the last was of native plants and ferns. Heptagonal 200 escudo coins have been issued in 1995 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of FAO and 20 years of independence. Another 200 escudo coin, this time round was issued in 2005 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of independence. Circulation of the 200 escudo coin is not quite as widespread as the other denominations but they are still commonly distributed and accepted alongside the 200 escudo note.\n\nIn 1914, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino introduced notes in denominations of 4, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos. In 1921, notes for 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 escudos were issued. The next series of notes, introduced in 1945, omitted all denominations below 5 escudos (which had been replaced by coins) and included 500 escudo notes. 10 escudo notes were replaced by coins in 1953, with the 5 escudo note also withdrawn.\n\nAfter independence on 5 July 1975, notes were issued for 100, 500, and 1000 escudos on 1 July 1977. The next series of notes was introduced in 1989 and consisted of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2500 escudos.\n\nThe third series was introduced in 1992 in denominations of 200, 500, 1000, with the addition in 1999 of 2000 and 5000 escudo notes. In 2005, the 200 escudo note was redesigned, followed by the 500 and 1000 in 2007.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Banco de Cabo Verde introduced a new series of banknotes that honor Cape Verdean figures in the fields of literature, music, and politics. It consists of denominations of 200, 1,000 and 2,000 escudos issued in 2014, with the former now printed on polymer, and banknotes of 500 and 5,000 escudos issued in 2015.\n\n\n"}

Its more than six hundred annual performances performed 48 weeks of the year include its critically acclaimed Shakespeare series, its World's Stage touring productions, and youth education and family oriented programming. The theater had garnered 77 Joseph Jefferson awards and three Laurence Olivier Awards. In 2008, it was the winner of the Regional Theatre Tony Award.\n\nFounded in 1986 in a pub, in 1999 the CST moved to a purpose built seven-story theater complex on Navy Pier, where it has a main 500 seat space called the Courtyard, and the 200 seat Theater Upstairs. In 2017, it expanded on the pier into a connected three-theater-campus with the addition of The Yard, a flexible space that allows for versatile arrangements from 150 seats to 850 seats and from proscenium to in-the-round.\n\nThe company's present artistic director Barbara Gaines founded the theater in 1986, when it began performances on the roof of the Red Lion Pub in the city's Lincoln Park neighborhood. In 1999, the company received permission to build its permanent home: a two-venue facility at Navy Pier.\n\nProductions at the theater include works from the Shakespearean canon as well as other plays and musicals. In addition to its own original productions, the Chicago Shakespeare Theater also hosts touring productions from other theater companies.\n\nChicago Shakespeare Theater is part of Theatre Communications Group (TCG), the Shakespeare Theatre Association of America (STAA) and National Alliance for Musical Theatre (NAMT) and the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE).\n\nChicago Shakespeare Theater was founded as the Chicago Shakespeare Workshop by current Artistic Director Barbara Gaines in 1986, a name which was changed a year later to the Chicago Shakespeare Repertory and finally in 1999 to Chicago Shakespeare Theater. It performed its first twelve seasons in residency at the Ruth Page Theater, where it performed titles ranging from better-known Shakespeare plays such as \"Hamlet\" and \"King Lear\" as well as lesser-known titles such as \"Troilus and Cressida\" and \"Timon of Athens\". Although the theater was critically lauded for its innovative approach to classic works, it was limited by the age and spatial restrictions of the Ruth Page Theater and began looking for a new performance space in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1997, CST announced its plans to move from the Ruth Page to a new facility located at Navy Pier, a place better known for its family attractions and in fact the most popular tourist attraction in the Midwest. The move was accompanied by a public relations blitz, which even involved Mayor Richard M. Daley naming April 23, 1997 Shakespeare Repertory Day. The company began a large-scale capital campaign to finance the move, and opened its 1999-2000 season in its new, state-of-the-art facility. Since then, CST has grown from the third-largest theater company in Chicago to the third-largest in the entire Midwest, at a rate 400% faster than the industry growth trend.\n\nChicago Shakespeare Theater has, since October 1999, been in residence in a purpose built, seven-story, facility at Chicago's Navy Pier, which houses its box office, administrative offices, and performance venues. The first performance at this facility was Eric Idle reading from his novel, \"The Road to Mars\".\n\nThe 510-seat Courtyard Theater, which is the primary production venue for CST, features state-of-the-art technology and acoustics together with a versatile thrust stage and deep proscenium, that create a flexible performance space. A second theater, the 200-seat black box \"Upstairs\" space, is devoted to smaller but still-popular productions such as The Second City's smash hit, \"Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People Vs. Friar Laurence, The Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet\".\n\n\n"}

It is related to common lettuce (\"L. sativa\"), and is often called wild lettuce, bitter lettuce, laitue vireuse, opium lettuce, poisonous lettuce, tall lettuce, great lettuce or rakutu-karyumu-so.\n\n\"Lactuca virosa\" is biennial, similar to prickly lettuce \"Lactuca serriola\" but taller - it can grow to 200 cm (80 inches or almost 7 feet). It is also stouter, the stem and leaves are more purple flushed, the leaves are less divided, but more spreading. Similar to \"Mycelis muralis\" but showing more than 5 florets.\n\nThe achene is purple black, without bristles at the tip. The pappus is the same as \"Lactuca serriola\".\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, it flowers from July until September.\n\nFound coastally in Great Britain, rarely in north-east of Ireland. \"Lactuca virosa\" is widespread across much of central and southern Europe. It can be found locally in the south east and east of England. In the rest of Great Britain it is very rare, and in Ireland it is absent. It is also found in the Punjab Region of Pakistan India and Australia where it grows in the wild.\n\nIn North America, it has been documented as introduced in California, Alabama, Iowa, and Washington, DC, and grows wild in other parts of the continent.\n\n\"Lactuca virosa\" was used in the 19th century by physicians when opium could not be obtained. It was studied extensively by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1911. They discovered two chemicals responsible for the properties of \"L. virosa\"; lactucopicrin and lactucin. In the United States, the plant experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s. Today the plant is un-scheduled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning it is legal to grow, purchase, and own without prescription or licence.\n\n\"Wild Salad\" has long been known in the world of \"natural remedies\" or \"alternative treatments\". It is often referred to as the poor man’s opium.\n\nA latex which is called lactucarium can be derived from the extract of the stem secretions of \"Lactuca virosa\". Oils and extracts can also be produced from \"L. virosa\". These oils and extracts have sedative properties in rodents. Although the standard definition of lactucarium requires its production from \"Lactuca virosa\", it was recognized that smaller quantities of lactucarium could be produced in a similar way from \"Lactuca sativa\" and \"Lactuca canadensis\" var. \"elongata\", and even that lettuce-opium obtained from \"Lactuca serriola\" or \"Lactuca quercina\" was of superior quality.\n\n\"Lactuca virosa\" contains flavonoids, coumarins, and \"N\"-methyl-β-phenethylamine. A variety of other chemical compounds have been isolated from \"L. virosa\". One of the compounds, lactucin, is an adenosine receptor agonist \"in vitro\", while another, lactucopicrin, has been shown to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor \"in vitro\".\n\n"}

It connects Tokyo with the east coast of Chiba Prefecture, passing through the cities of Funabashi, Chiba, and Chōshi. Its name derives from the old provinces of the area which it serves: Musashi (武蔵国), Shimōsa (下総国) and Kazusa (上総国). Its official line color is yellow.\n\nFormally, the Sōbu Main Line refers to the line from Tokyo to .\n\nHowever, informally, the character of the line changes at Chiba. The more urbanized section west of Chiba is informally, but commonly, called the without using \"Main\". The \"Main Line\", in popular usage, refers to the more rural section east of Chiba.\n\nRoute maps, signs at stations, in trains, and the vocal announcements all maintain this distinction: \"with Main\" for the eastern rural section; \"without Main\" for the western frequent travel zone.\n\n\nLocal trains run between Ochanomizu and Chiba Station and are called the or . \n\nRapid trains are also operated from Tokyo Station to Chiba Station and use different tracks from the local service trains. These Rapid trains sometimes continue east on the Main Line after reaching Chiba. In reverse, Sobu Main Line trains also sometimes continue west on the Rapid Line after reaching Chiba, some even go on the Yokosuka Line after Tokyo. The rapid trains are called . \n\nFor the most part, Rapid and Local trains run parallel with each other, except when they reach Kinshicho, where Sōbu Line Local trains continue onto the Chūō Line at Ochanomizu via Akihabara, while Sōbu Line Rapid trains head to Tokyo, with most of them continuing onto the Yokosuka Line. \n\nFor more details of services west of Chiba, see the relevant articles for the Local and Rapid Lines.\n\nThe section east of Chiba, from Chiba to Chōshi, is commonly known as the . The aforementioned Sōbu Rapid Line through service trains would terminate at Sakura or Narutō on the Main Line, or go on the Narita Line after Sakura for Narita Airport or Kashima-Jingu. Aside from that, there are also local trains running along the entire section, from Chiba to Chōshi.\n\nThe \"Narita Express\" to Narita Airport Station and the \"Ayame\" to Chōshi use the Sōbu Main Line for their journey.\n\n\"Shiosai\", also a Limited Express service, which operates from Tokyo Station to Chōshi, also uses this line.\n\n\"See Sōbu_Line_(Rapid)#Station_list for the detailed list of stations of the Sōbu Rapid Line\"\n\n\"See Chūō-Sōbu_Line#Station_list for the detailed list of stations of the Chūō-Sōbu Line.\"\n\nHere is a list of stations within this section.

It opened the first service sections, between Ichikawa and Sakura on July 20, 1894, and extended to Tokyo City. \nIn December of the same year, was opened, and in 1904, on the east bank of Sumida River, (now Ryōgoku) became a terminal of this line. The access routes to the west, to Tokyo City, were tramways for passengers and ships for freight. From Sahara to the east, this line reached another terminus, Chōshi in 1897.\n\nThe line was nationalized in 1907 under the Railway Nationalization Act, and was double-tracked from Ryōgokubashi to Chiba the next year. The predecessor of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) planned to connect with other lines inside Tokyo. In 1932, a new passenger line was opened from Ochanomizu to Ryōgoku (with new platform besides the original terminal facility), and a frequent service of EMUs commenced. Electrification to Chiba was completed in 1935, and local trains have run through from the Chūō line since then. But, except for a few trains, no rapid service was operated on this line, and the passengers had to use the local train, or its rival, Keisei Electric Railway.\n\nOn March 10, 1945, the Bombing of Tokyo caused casualties estimated at 70,000–100,000, and destroyed stations of the line. During the last days of World War II in 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army thought the US Army would attempt a landing operation, \"Operation Coronet\", on Kujūkuri Beach, and transferred troops on the Sōbu Main Line.\n\nBetween Chiba and Chōshi, in the rural area of Chiba Prefecture, steam traction was used until recently. Fish and soy sauce from Chōshi were major freight items. Because Tokyo was close, JNR did not provide rapid or express trains from Ryōgoku to Chōshi until 1958. JNR operated tourist trains from Ryōgoku to the seaside resorts on the coast from the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, JNR started the to steeply increase commuter demand, and it determined that a new rapid line would be constructed from Tokyo Station to Chiba. A new underground line from Tokyo to Kinshichō, and a four-tracked section to Tsudanuma were opened in 1972, and the operator began frequent rapid services from Tokyo to Chiba. The line was managed by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) from 1987. The parallel Keiyō Line was opened closer to the coast in 1990. It was first constructed for freight services but later to carry passengers.\n\nTo the east of Chiba, electrification reached Chōshi in 1974, and Limited Express \"Shiosai\" has been operated from the underground Tokyo Station since 1975. Freight services from Chōshi ceased in 1986, just before the privatization of JNR, and regular passenger trains stopped using the Ryōgoku terminal platforms in 1988. JR East started a new airport train, the Narita Express in 1991. Rapid urbanization around Chiba Station made this section important for commuter traffic, for the city of Chiba, and for Greater Tokyo.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2138327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138327", "title": "Odyssean Wicca", "text": "Odyssean Wicca\n\nOdyssean Wicca is a Wiccan tradition created in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the late 1970s. Its principal founders were Tamarra and Richard James. Most of its practitioners today live in Ontario, but it also has members in Eastern Canada and the United States. The tradition differs from other initiatory Wiccan traditions in its emphasis on preparation of its members for public priesthood.\n\nThe Odyssean tradition is strongly connected with the Wiccan Church of Canada, a public Wiccan church also founded by the Jameses.\n\nThe Odyssean Tradition of Wicca was founded by Richard and Tamara James in 1979, along with other members of their coven. The name of the tradition was inspired by Homer's \"Odyssey\", and is meant to emphasize a belief in life as a \"spiritual journey\".\n\nThe tradition grew out of the James' creation of the Wiccan Church of Canada, with which the tradition is still very closely associated. While the James’s and their coven members claimed to have had backgrounds in Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca, and Continental Wicca, these claims were never substantiated—the general consensus of the British Traditional Wiccan community in Ontario prior to 1987 was that these claims had no substance whatsoever. Regardless, those traditions were not ideally suited for the goal of creating a place for public Neopagan worship, nor did any of these reflect the ritual style that the coven (and, by extension, the church) were adopting—with the exception of Pagan Way (an Outer Court system created by Gardnerian initiates) that had a direct influence upon Wiccan Church of Canada liturgy. The Odyssean tradition is a British Traditional-like Eclectic tradition of Wicca—with a public Wiccan priesthood providing religious services for a Neopagan laity. In 1987, the James' purchased much of Gerald Gardner's collection back from Ripleys, this included Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical. It is after this purchase that the James' received valid initiations and elevations into the various traditions and lineages British Traditional Wicca .\n\nThe Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada reached their apex in 1992—at that time there were four temples (Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, and Kitchener-Waterloo) and three proto-temples in Brampton, Oshawa, and Montreal. Currently, the Wiccan Church of Canada has only two temples; the mother temple in Toronto, Ontario and a temple in Hamilton, Ontario . While the influence of the Wiccan Church of Canada has declined over the past decade, the indirect influence of the Odyssean tradition has grown. Because the WCC is a public Modern Pagan church, and because many members of the laity, many neophytes, and many initiates step away from the WCC to follow their path elsewhere. There are more former members of the WCC laity and more retired neophytes and initiates of the Odyssean tradition than there are active initiates. Many of these retired Odysseans have gone on to found their own covens and traditions that are based upon Odyssean practices. Many of the other Wiccan churches that exist in Canada, and to some extent the United States, have drawn upon Odyssean sources and retired Odysseans.\n\nPrior to 1987, an Odyssean initiate who had been elevated into the High Priesthood would be autonomous of both the tradition's founders and of the WCC. That meant that they could initiate and/or elevate their students up to the highest degree (3rd Degree) without requiring approval from the other High Priesthood of the tradition. For those initiated after 1987, these initiates would have to retain active status—they must perform a minimal level of religious services (public rituals and public classes) to one of the temples of the Wiccan Church of Canada—for them to even bring a student before the Odyssean Priesthood Council. The Odyssean Priesthood Council is open to all initiates who currently have active status and it is only after obtaining the approval of the Council that an initiate may initiate or elevate their student. If an initiate fails to perform the minimum amount of religious services to one of the Wiccan Church of Canada temples, their status will be downgraded to inactive. An Odyssean initiate who has been inactive for more than one year and one day can be reclassified by the High Priesthood of the tradition as retired. A retired Odyssean initiate can only return to active status with the permission of the High Priesthood of the tradition. Therefore, while the Odyssean tradition and the WCC were separate during the foundation years of the church, it has been the practice for the past twenty years that the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada are firmly linked one to the other.\n\nBeyond the emphasis on public ministry, the Odyssean tradition is characterized by the following: it is an Eclectic tradition in its origins that has a strong British Traditional Wicca style to its forms of organization and initiation; although it emulates British Traditional the tradition's approach to ritual is more flexible and may often be less structured than many British Traditional Wiccans would be comfortable with; the tradition rejects the concepts of Neopagan monism and Neopagan monotheism; the tradition does accept the base-line Wiccan concept of Neopagan duotheism but does encourage students and seekers alike to choose to affiliate with a particular Pagan pantheon and encourages the devotion to a deity (or group of deities) .\n\nThe Odyssean training system is remarked upon as being notably rigorous, which can be observed in the Wiccan Church of Canada weekly classes. These classes comprise the basic body of knowledge considered necessary by Odysseans, and can span upwards of 150 hours of class time or more. Completion of these classes (which includes the student completing the homework exercises assigned) is often considered a minimum requirement by Initiates before they accept a person as a new student.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Odyssean Wicca was inspired at least in part by the Gardnerian, Alexandrian, Continental, and Blue Star traditions.\n\nDespite the first part of its name, like all forms of Wicca, Odyssean Wicca has no connection to the modern religion of Hellenismos, which is based on the worship of the Greek Gods of antiquity.\n\nBlue Star Wicca does have a special relationship to the Odyssean tradition, as a \"sister\" or \"cousin\" tradition. The Dymond line of Alexandrian Wicca also has a unique relationship with the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada. Because the Odyssean tradition has been created from the known published material (circa 1979) of Gardnerian Wicca and Alexandrian Wicca a greater exposure to the ritual style of other Wiccan and Modern Pagan traditions is offered to Odyssean laity, neophytes, and initiates through the Wiccan Church of Canada .\n\nThere are currently two temples in Canada, one based in Toronto and the other in Hamilton. Within the United States, there is a Pagan temple in Connecticut, the Panthean Temple.\n\n\n----\n"}

In the late 1970s, the family moved to the Bay Area.\n\nSon of the late civil rights activist Angel Manuel Alderete, he was exposed to jazz music on a weekly basis by his father, who often played it around the Alderete household. Juan decided to pick up the bass after he and his friends decided to start a band. Other early influences included his brother's progressive rock albums, which included bands such as Yes, Rush, King Crimson, etc. He started learning the basics of the bass guitar when he was 16, and was influenced by such players as Jaco Pastorius, Geddy Lee, and Stanley Clarke. Some of his other influences include Jamaladeen Tacuma and John Entwistle, the bass player for the Who. His fascination with the bass guitar revolved around it being a somewhat \"underappreciated\" instrument at the time.\n\nAlderete enrolled in Musicians Institute in Hollywood (Los Angeles, CA). He enjoyed his time in the school, explaining that he was able to learn techniques and styles that he had never even considered prior to his enrollment. Alderete and fellow student Paul Gilbert started their musical relationship during an audition that Alderete held to find a drummer. Alderete showed up at the audition, bringing a Musician's Institute student and drum-playing friend named Bill Lescohier. Although Lescohier was turned down for the part, Gilbert was impressed with Alderete's bass playing; the two quickly sought to form a speed metal band that would incorporate Gilbert's advanced neoclassical metal guitar technique with Alderete's solid bass lines. To complete the band, Harry Gschoesser joined to fill the drummer position, and Jeff Martin became the vocalist; the group named themselves Racer X (a title that Lescohier had suggested). With this lineup, the band released their debut album, \"Street Lethal\", in 1986. Alderete has been recording with Racer X ever since (note: there was a ten-year hiatus starting from 1989), and their latest album was released in 2002, titled \"Getting Heavier\". Alderete is credited as John Alderete on all Racer X albums.\n\nHowever, four years after the creation of the band, Gilbert left Racer X to form the band Mr. Big. The remaining members of Racer X decided to stay active in music, although they went their separate ways. For the next ten years, Alderete would be involved in several different bands (including The Scream, DC-10, Big Sir, and Distortion Felix) as well as becoming an instructor at Musicians Institute. Not long after, he released his first instructional video on bass techniques and modulation.\n\nAlthough \"Extreme Volume II: Live\" was released in 1992, Racer X was not actually reunited. That year, Paul Gilbert was touring with Mr. Big, and Alderete was recording with a hard rock band called The Scream. In actuality, the album was just a compilation of songs that were recorded in concerts before the hiatus. However, around 1999, Alderete got a telephone call from Paul Gilbert, who asked if there was any possibility of recording another Racer X album. Juan agreed, and Racer X reunited to record \"Technical Difficulties\", which features new material as well as older songs that were never recorded.\n\nIn 2003, while working as a radio producer, Alderete received a call from Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta while on their European tour with an offer to audition for the band:\n\nHe went on to record \"Frances The Mute\" with them in 2004, and has played bass on every Mars Volta album since, as well as a number of solo albums by Omar Rodríguez-López. Since joining the band, he has played at Madison Square Garden and was featured on the front cover of the March 2005 issue of Bass Player Magazine.\n\nAside from The Mars Volta, Alderete has been invested in his own musical projects. Big Sir is a group composed of Juan and singer Lisa Papineau that has released four albums. Vato Negro is a group with a revolving door of musicians; originally a duo of Alderete and drummer Matt Sherrod, it has since featured Deantoni Parks, Omar Rodriguez-López, and Jon Theodore in various lineups. Alderete has played shows with both groups in 2010, in California and Fuji Rock Festival in Japan.\n\nIn addition, Alderete co-produced the film \"The Sentimental Engine Slayer\" with Rodríguez-López and former Mars Volta bandmate Paul Hinojos.\n\nAfter The Mars Volta broke up in 2013, Alderete joined vocalist Cedric-Bixler Zavala in his new band, Zavalaz, and later became the touring bassist for Deltron 3030. Juan also runs a website dedicated to showcasing effects pedals and other musical gear called PedalsAndEffects.com.\n\nAlderete also laid down the bass line for the late rapper and singer Lil Peep on his 2017 single \"Benz Truck\". \n\nOn November 5, 2017. Alderete filled in bass for Marilyn Manson at the Ozzfest Meets Knotfest festival, replacing longtime bassist Jeordie White, a.k.a. Twiggy Ramirez. He has been Manson's bass player on tour since.\n\nAlderete lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Anne.\n\nOn May 1, 2007, Alderete announced that he had been diagnosed with polycythemia vera, a rare blood disease. However he also mentioned that he is feeling fine, will experience no side effects from the medication, and will continue to play music.\nSince discovering his condition, Alderete had agreed to become a spokesman for the MPD Foundation.\n\nOn January 13, 2020, Alderete sustained a serious brain injury as a result of a bicycle accident near his home. Despite wearing protective equipment, he was in a coma for almost 4 weeks. As of March 25th, he is conscious and aware and is recovering at a rehabilitation facility. His wife, Anne, posts regular updates to his social media pages.\n\nInfluenced by players like Jaco Pastorius, Alderete's main playing technique is to use the \"standard\" fingers to pluck the strings with his right hand (two fingers: index and middle). He occasionally uses Dunlop Gel picks, as well as his signature picks. He is also known to use two-handed tapping techniques and even slapping/popping, which was influenced by Louis Johnson, the bass player for the American funk and R&B band The Brothers Johnson. Alderete also cites Dr. Dre and Kool Keith of the hip hop group Ultramagnetic MCs as influences. While the two didn't formally play bass, Alderete looks to their bass lines for influence.\n\n\nThe Laklands that Alderete had on tour are:\n\n\nLakland had made Alderete a bass guitar that if popular, would become a signature model, assumed to be based on his modified 70's fretless Fender Jazz that he used during the \"Frances the Mute\" tour.\n\n\nFor live shows he was most recently using a white model with a white pickguard and maple fingerboard.\n\n\nAlderete was featured on the first issue of the online magazine Resonate, talking about his Ampeg Rig.\n\nA short, and incomplete, list: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2138362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138362", "title": "National Provincial Bank", "text": "National Provincial Bank\n\nNational Provincial Bank was a British retail bank which operated in England and Wales from 1833 until 1970 when it was merged into the National Westminster Bank. It continued to exist as a dormant non-trading company until 2016 when it was voluntarily struck off the register and dissolved.\n\nConsidered one of the \"Big Five,\" the National Provincial Bank expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries and took over a number of smaller banking companies. It was based on Bishopsgate, at the thoroughfare's junction with Threadneedle Street, in London.\n\nIt is possible to still see evidence of this bank at Waterloo Station in London, where the logo has been removed but the outline of the words remain.\n\nThe National Provincial Bank played a unique role in the development of commercial banking. Prior to the Act of 1826, English banks were permitted to have no more than six partners – hence the expression \"private banks\". The only banks allowed to be joint stock were the Bank of England and the Scottish banks (which operated under a different legal system). The leading campaigner for change was Thomas Joplin a Newcastle timber merchant \"with local experience of banking disasters\" and an observer of the greater stability of the nearby Scottish banks. The Act of 1826 permitted the establishment of joint stock banks but note issue was only allowed outside a radius of 65 miles of London. The 1826 Act was followed by the creation of new provincial joint stock banks and conversions from existing private banks. Because of the prohibition on note issue in the London area, it was incorrectly assumed that the Act also prohibited joint stock banks themselves, an ambiguity that was removed by the Bank Charter Act 1833.\n\nWhat differentiated National Provincial was that it was established as a provincial bank but with a London head office. Moreover, it was specifically structured to be a branch banking enterprise prepared to concentrate on a large number of smaller accounts rather than a small number of large accounts. When Thomas Joplin discovered that the laws preventing the establishment of joint stock banks in Ireland had been repealed in 1824, he promoted the Irish Provincial Banking Company, to be based in London but with branches in all the principal towns in Ireland outside Dublin; this was to be a forerunner of Joplin’s English version. Joplin left the management of the Irish Bank in 1828. Financial support from his cousin George Angas was promised in 1829 and a company was formed in 1830. The first meeting resolved to establish a \"system of banking …under the review of a central board in London [and] applied to the direction of country banking\". There were numerous delays but the National Provincial Bank of England was eventually launched in 1833. For more than thirty years the bank operated as a country bank, with its headquarters in London, but not transacting banking business in the capital.\n\nThe first branch to be opened, at the beginning of 1834, was in Gloucester followed, as if at random, by Brecon, Walsall, Birmingham, Wotton-under-Edge, Boston and Wisbech and by 1836 there were 32 branches. Considerable dissension soon arose relating to the structure of the branch system and Joplin, who favoured a network of local semi-autonomous banks, left. The model for the branch system had been the Scottish one, and the Bank reinforced this by recruiting Daniel Robertson from the Union Bank of Scotland; he served as general manager for thirty years.\n\nMany of the branches that were \"opened\" during the nineteenth century came from the acquisition of local banks, sometimes as a going concern, sometimes merely taking over the premises after a failure. Sources vary as to the number of acquisitions, their common trading name and even the exact year of purchase. However, although they may have been strategic in their own locality, none of the acquisitions appeared to be large. It was not until 1866 that the bank opened for banking business in London by which time it had a nationwide network of 122 branches. The bank ceased its provincial note issue and was appointed to the London Clearing House. By 1886 the National Provincial Bank had 165 branches and its network was second only to the London and County Bank. There was now little in the way of acquisition but the branch network continued to increase - according to \"RBS Heritage Online\", there were 200 branches by 1900 and over 450 by the time of the 1918 merger (however, the scale of the post-1900 increase is surprisingly large and the latter figure may include sub-branches).\n\nThe bishop's gate device was part of a pictorial representation of the bank's address at 15 Bishopsgate in the City of London. It is surmounted by two squirrels (suggested by the College of Arms as denoting thrift and foresight) supporting an urn; this alludes to The Flower Pot Inn which originally stood on the site of the entrance to the city office.\n\nIn 1918 the National Provincial acquired the Union of London and Smith’s Bank, itself the product of recent amalgamations. The enlarged bank was renamed the National Provincial and Union Bank of England.\n\nThe Union Bank of London was formed in 1839 and it remained a purely metropolitan bank for the rest of the century; it was of no great size during that period, opening around a dozen branches in central London and acquiring the occasional small local bank. Although it refused to open branches in the provinces, it did develop an extensive overseas business. Policy changed at the turn of the century and the Union embarked on a major expansion acquiring in particular the private Cripplegate Bank in 1900, Smith's Bank in 1902 and Prescott’s Bank in 1903, thereby forming the Union of London and Smith’s Bank.\n\nPrescott’s Bank was founded in Threadneedle Street in 1766 and went through several name changes over the years as partners changed. However, in 1891 a multiple merger radically changed the scope of the Bank. Prescott’s acquired Dimsdale, another long-established London private bank; Miles, Cave, Baillie of Bristol (established 1750); and Tugwell Brymer of Bath; the enlarged firm was called Prescott, Dimsdale, Cave, Tugwell & Co. Several more small country banks were later acquired and the Bank’s name was shortened to Prescott & Co. in 1903, shortly before its acquisition by the Union Bank.\n\nRecognising its enlarged scale, the Bank’s name was extended to the National Provincial and Union Bank of England but in 1924 the name was shortened to the National Provincial Bank. Further acquisitions followed the 1918 merger, in particular the prestigious London Coutts Bank in 1920. Significant regional banks included Bradford District Bank (1919), Sheffield Banking Company (1919) and Northamptonshire Union Bank (1920). In 1924 the small Guernsey Banking Co. was to be the Bank's last domestic acquisition until 1961 and National Provincial’s progress came from continued branch opening, particularly around the London area.\n\nNational Provincial did have a small overseas operation in the form of a 50 per cent share of Lloyds and National Provincial Foreign Bank in Paris, which it had acquired in 1917 and sold to Lloyds Bank in 1955. However, its more substantive overseas move came in 1924 with the acquisition of Grindlays Bank, a London-based institution with offices in India and specialising in serving the Indian army. Grindlays had been affected by the failure of competing banks and sought a larger partner. Grindlays was allowed to operate independently and was sold to the London-based National Bank of India in 1948.\n\nIn 1961 National Provincial acquired the Isle of Man Bank but the major acquisition came in 1962 when the District Bank was bought, creating a company with over £1.4 billion in assets and 2,100 branches. The District, being the one-time Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company, gave the National Provincial valuable exposure to the north west. The District (as well as Coutts) maintained its separate identity until the merger with Westminster Bank.\n\nThe merger of National Provincial and Westminster Bank in 1968, surprised the British public and banking community \"as it was still widely assumed...that any merger among the 'Big Five' would not be permitted.\" Nevertheless, the financial authorities did permit the merger and a new company, National Westminster Bank, was formed to acquire the share capital of the two constituent banks. The enlarged entity now had a network of 3,600 branches.\n\nThe District Bank, National Provincial, and Westminster Bank were fully integrated in the new firm's structure, while Coutts & Co., Ulster Bank (a 1917 Westminster acquisition), and the Isle of Man Bank continued as separate operations. Duncan Stirling, chairman of Westminster Bank, became first chairman and each bank provided a joint chief executive. NatWest, as it became known, became part of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 2000.\n\nIn 1924 the bank was involved in a notable court case. In England and those common law jurisdictions whose approach follows that of English law in treating the duty of confidentiality as resting in contract, the classic authority is the Court of Appeal decision in \"Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England\". The duty extends at least to information concerning account transactions and extends beyond the date of the termination of the banker customer contract. Information attained from other sources, such as a credit reference agency, is also covered. The duty is not absolute for the bank may disclose information where the disclosure is under compulsion by law, where there is a duty to the public to disclose, where the interests of the bank require disclosure and where the disclosure is made by the express or implied consent of the customer.\n"}

Considered one of the Big Five, it expanded during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and took over a number of smaller banking companies.\n\nIn 1834, the London and Westminster Bank was the first firm founded under the auspices of the Bank Charter Act 1833, which allowed joint-stock banks to be established in the capital. For various reasons, the press, private banking concerns, and the Bank of England were so hostile to the Bank Charter Act that London and Westminster's management was primarily concerned with defending the company's right to exist rather than setting up an extensive branch network. As a result, the bank opened only six London branches in its first three years and no additional offices were established until nearly 20 years later.\n\nLondon and Westminster made its first acquisition in 1847, when it bought Young & Son. In about 1870 it acquired Unity Joint-Stock Bank, and mergers with Commercial Bank of London and Middlesex Bank had been arranged in 1861 and 1863 respectively. By 1909 London and Westminster had opened or acquired 37 branches in and around London. Yet, despite this expansion effort, the bank felt the effects of competition from provincial banks like Lloyds and Midland. These two banks had already established large regional branch networks and were quickly encroaching upon the London market. In order to meet this challenge, in 1909, London and Westminster merged with the influential and prestigious London and County Bank, which had seventy offices citywide and almost two hundred in rural counties.\n\nThe Surrey, Kent and Sussex Banking Company had been established at Southwark in 1836 and soon had branches in places like Croydon, Brighton, Maidstone and Woolwich. It was renamed the London and County Banking Co. in 1839. By 1875 it had over 150 branches and was the largest British bank. The resulting entity was named the London County and Westminster Bank. Prior to the merger, London and County had already taken over the business of the following banks:\n\nIn 1913, the bank formed a subsidiary, London County and Westminster Bank (Paris), which opened branches during and after World War I in Bordeaux (1917), Lyon (1918), Marseilles (1918) and Nantes (1919). The bank itself also directly established offices in Madrid (1917), Barcelona (1917), Antwerp (1919), Brussels (1919), Bilbao (1919) and Valencia (1920).\n\nThese operations were converted into a foreign bank in 1920 and renamed London County Westminster and Parrs Foreign Bank, becoming Westminster Foreign Bank in 1923 and finally International Westminster Bank in 1973. All the Spanish branches were closed in 1923–4 due to deteriorating economic conditions in Spain and discrimination against foreign banks. Control of the remaining branches was exercised from London, although between 1940 and 1944 contact with them was lost due to the German occupation.\n\nBirkbeck Building and Freehold Land Society, formed in 1851, developed a large deposit-taking business that developed into banking activity. Cheque books were issued from 1858 and by 1872 the business was trading under the title of Birkbeck Bank. In 1910, when its balance sheet totalled £12.26 million and it had 112,817 accounts, the bank experienced a run. Continuing rumours about its financial position and a climate of depreciation in gilt-edged securities, led to a suspension of payments. The Bank of England provided support for the immediate payment of 10 shillings in the pound to depositors, but as most of its deposits were held as long-term securities the bank lacked liquidity and went into receivership. In 1911 its goodwill and premises were purchased from the receiver by London County and Westminster Bank.\n\nIn 1917, bank officials decided to acquire the Ulster Bank (which continued to operate separately), with 170 branches throughout Ireland, and in 1918 bought Parr's Bank, with over 320 offices throughout England. These purchases made London County Westminster and Parrs (which became simply Westminster Bank Limited in 1923) the fifth-largest bank in England. The Parr's name survives in the Bloomsbury, Parr's Branch of National Westminster Bank at 214 High Holborn, London.\n\nDuring the economic difficulties of the late 1920s and early 1930s, the bank kept tight centralised control over the continental branch of the business to avoid the dangers of too rapid an expansion in unfamiliar markets, but this policy stunted Westminster's international operations. It did mean that the bank escaped the bad debts and currency fluctuations that plagued many other banks between the world wars, allowing the domestic side of the business to grow steadily. The bank continued to expand through acquisition, namely:\n\nPaid-up capital rose from £9 million in 1923 to £40.5 million in 1935. By 1939 there were 1,100 branches and at the time of the merger with National Provincial Bank in 1968, Westminster had 1,400 branches in England alone.\n\nThe portcullis used by the bank was one of the familiar badges of King Henry VII and derived from the arms of the royal City of Westminster; the \"fess wavy\", signifying the River Thames, derived from the arms of the County of London. The present National Westminster Bank continues to use the portcullis in its common seal (the official seal kept in accordance with section 40 of the Companies Act).\n\nThe merger of Westminster and National Provincial Bank, announced in early 1968, shocked the British public and banking community. Although the Bank of England had indicated a willingness to allow mergers as part of a rationalisation process, no one had seriously believed it would permit mergers among the largest and most influential banks.\n\nThe District Bank (a 1962 National Provincial acquisition), National Provincial, and Westminster Bank were fully integrated in the new firm's structure, while Coutts & Co. (a 1920 National Provincial acquisition), Ulster Bank and the Isle of Man Bank (a 1961 National Provincial acquisition) continued as separate operations. Duncan Stirling, chairman of Westminster Bank, became first chairman of the fifth largest bank in the world. In 1969 David Robarts, former chairman of National Provincial, assumed Stirling's position. The statutory process of integration was completed in 1969 and the new company, National Westminster Bank Limited, opened its doors for business on 1 January 1970. NatWest, as it became known, is now part of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.\n\n\n"}

In RSVP, a sequence of stimuli are shown to an observer at one location in their visual field. The observer is instructed to report one of these stimuli - the target - which has a feature that differentiates it from the rest of the stream. For instance, observers may see a sequence of stimuli consisting of grey letters with the exception of one red letter. They are told to report the red letter. People make errors in this task in the form of reports of stimuli that occurred before or after the target. The position in time of the letter they report, relative to the target, is an estimate of the timing of visual selection on that trial.\n\nPeripheral reading is vital to those suffering from central field loss, which is most commonly seen in the elderly. Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements. Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.\n\n"}

Wajid Ali Shah met her in his palace. She rebelled against the British East India Company during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. She finally found asylum in Nepal where she died in 1879. After her husband had been exiled to Calcutta, she took charge of the affairs in the state of Awadh and seized control of Lucknow. She organised an army of women and placed Uda Devi as its commander. She actively took part in the revolt of 1857 against the Doctrine of Lapse under which Dalhousie wanted her to surrender Lucknow. She gave stiff resistance. But after the fall of Lucknow she escaped to Kathmandu. She was a very brave woman and such bravery in a male-dominated society was unprecedented. She made her son, Prince Birjis Qadr, the \"Wali\" (ruler) of Awadh; However, she was forced to abandon this role after a short reign. \"Pasi respondents first documented the story of Begum Hazrat Mahal in print in the 1971 Census records. Though the name of Uda Devi was not mentioned, the respondents mentioned that, in the war of 1857, a Pasi Palton (a platoon of Pasis) rescued Begum Hazrat Mahal from imprisonment by the British (Census of India 1971: 2). It was only later that the story of Uda Devi came to be incorporated into the narrative. After 1990, the story found organisational support for its transmission and celebration with the formation of the Virangana Uda Devi Smarak Sansthan.\"\n\nMahal's name was Muhammadi Khanum, and she was born at Faizabad, Awadh, India. She was a courtesan by profession and had been taken into the royal harem as a \"khawasin\" after being sold by her parents, then to Royal agents, and later promoted to a \"pari\", and was known as Mahak Pari. She became a \"begum\" after being accepted as a royal concubine of the King of Awadh, and the title 'Hazrat Mahal' was bestowed on her after the birth of their son, Birjis Qadra.\n\nShe was a junior wife of the last Tajdaar-e-Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah. The British had annexed Awadh in 1856 and Wajid Ali Shah was exiled to Calcutta. After her husband was exiled to Calcutta, she took charge of the affairs of the state of Awadh despite her divorce from the Nawab, which then was a large part of the current state of Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nDuring the [Indian Rebellion of 1857], from 1857 to 1858, Begum Hazrat Mahal's band of supporters, led by Raja Jailal Singh, rebelled against the forces of the British; later, they seized control of Lucknow and she declared her son, Birjis Qadr, as the ruler (\"Wali\") of Oudh.\n\nOne of the principal complaints of Begum Hazrat Mahal was that the East India Company had casually demolished Temples and mosques just to make way for roads. In a proclamation issued during the final days of the revolt, she mocked the British claim to allow freedom of worship: \nWhen the forces under the command of the British re-captured Lucknow and most of Oudh, she was forced to retreat. Hazrat Mahal worked in association with Nana Saheb, but later joined the Maulavi of Faizabad in the attack on Shahjahanpur.\n\nUltimately, she had to retreat to Nepal, where she was initially refused asylum by the Rana prime minister Jang Bahadur, but was later allowed to stay. She died there in 1879 and was buried in a nameless grave in the grounds of Kathmandu's Jama Masjid. After her death, on the occasion of the jubilee of Queen Victoria (1887), the British Government pardoned Birjis Qadar and he was allowed to return home.\n\nBegum Hazrat Mahal's tomb is located in central part of Kathmandu near Jama Masjid, Ghantaghar, not far away from the famous Darbar Marg. It is looked after by the Jama Masjid Central Committee.\nOn 15 August 1962, Mahal was honoured at the Old Victoria Park in Hazratganj, Lucknow for her role in the Great Revolt. Along with the renaming of the park, a marble memorial was constructed, which includes a marble tablet with four round brass plaques bearing the Coat of Arms of the Awadh royal family. The park has been used for Ramlilas and bonfires during Dusshera, as well as Lucknow Mahotsava (Lucknow Exposition).\n\nOn 10 May 1984, the Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in honour of Mahal. The first day cover was designed by C.R. Pakrashi, and the cancellation was done by Alka Sharma. 15,00,000 stamps were issued.\n\nThe Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India has started the Begum Hazrat Mahal National Scholarship for Meritorious Girls belonging to minority communities in India. This scholarship is implemented through the Maulana Azad Education Foundation.\n\n"}

Linear low-density polyethylene differs structurally from conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) because of the absence of long chain branching. The linearity of LLDPE results from the different manufacturing processes of LLDPE and LDPE. In general, LLDPE is produced at lower temperatures and pressures by copolymerization of ethylene and such higher alpha-olefins as butene, hexene, or octene. The copolymerization process produces an LLDPE polymer that has a narrower molecular weight distribution than conventional LDPE and in combination with the linear structure, significantly different rheological properties.\n\nThe production of LLDPE is initiated by transition metal catalysts, particularly Ziegler or Philips type of catalyst. The actual polymerization process can be done either in solution phase or in gas phase reactors. Usually, octene is the comonomer in solution phase while butene and hexene are copolymerized with ethylene in a gas phase reactor. LLDPE has higher tensile strength and higher impact and puncture resistance than does LDPE. It is very flexible and elongates under stress. It can be used to make thinner films, with better environmental stress cracking resistance. It has good resistance to chemicals. It has good electrical properties. However, it is not as easy to process as LDPE, has lower gloss, and narrower range for heat sealing.\n\nLDPE and LLDPE have unique rheological or melt flow properties. LLDPE is less shear sensitive because of its narrower molecular weight distribution and shorter chain branching. During a shearing process, such as extrusion, LLDPE remains more viscous and, therefore, harder to process than an LDPE of equivalent melt index. The lower shear sensitivity of LLDPE allows for a faster stress relaxation of the polymer chains during extrusion, and, therefore, the physical properties are susceptible to changes in blow-up ratios. In melt extension, LLDPE has lower viscosity at all strain rates. This means it will not strain harden the way LDPE does when elongated. As the deformation rate of the polyethylene increases, LDPE demonstrates a dramatic rise in viscosity because of chain entanglement. This phenomenon is not observed with LLDPE because of the lack of long-chain branching in LLDPE allows the chains to slide by one another upon elongation without becoming entangled. This characteristic is important for film applications because LLDPE films can be downgauged easily while maintaining high strength and toughness. The rheological properties of LLDPE are summarized as \"stiff in shear\" and \"soft in extension\". LLDPE can be recycled though into other things like trash can liners, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tiles, compost bins, and shipping envelopes\n\nLLDPE has penetrated almost all traditional markets for polyethylene; it is used for plastic bags and sheets (where it allows using lower thickness than comparable LDPE), plastic wrap, stretch wrap, pouches, toys, covers, lids, pipes, buckets and containers, covering of cables, geomembranes, and mainly flexible tubing. In 2013, the world market for LLDPE reached a volume of $40 billion. \n\nLLDPE manufactured by using metallocene catalysts is labeled \"mLLDPE\".\n\n\n\n"}

The band developed after Agnostic Front's front man Roger Miret would let his younger half-brother Freddy Cricien take the microphone and perform lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows.\n\nMadball was founded in 1988 and featured most of Agnostic Front's members. Madball consisted of Agnostic Front's vocalist Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and then 12-year-old vocalist Freddy Cricien, Roger Miret's younger half-brother. Madball's first few performances consisted of previously unused Agnostic Front songs. Madball's first release was the \"Ball of Destruction\" EP in 1989. After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, joined the band. By then, they recorded and released the EP, \"Droppin' Many Suckers\", for Wreck-Age Records. One year later, Roger Miret left the band and was replaced by bass player Jorge \"Hoya Roc\" Guerra — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band as his band, Dmize, was breaking up. The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994 and released a pair of full-lengths; \"Set It Off\" in 1994 and \"Demonstrating My Style\" in 1996. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown.\n\n1995 saw the band participating in the \"N.Y.H.C.\" documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29, 1995 at the now-defunct \"Coney Island High\". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year.\n\nConsisting of Cricien, Henderson, Guerra, and new drummer John Lafata (former drummer in Neglect), the band recorded \"Look My Way\", which was released in early 1998. \"Hold It Down\" followed two years later. The band announced their dissolution in 2001 but decided to reform in late 2002 with a new line-up featuring Brian \"Mitts\" Daniels and Rigg Ross. They began touring and recording at the end of 2002. Since then, Madball has come out with: \"Best of Madball\" in 2003, \"N.Y.H.C. EP\" (EP) in 2004, \"Legacy\" in 2005, and \"Infiltrate The System\" in 2007. In 2009, Rigg Ross left to join Skarhead and was replaced by Ben Dussault.\n\nAlong with bands such as Agnostic Front, Vietnom, Bulldoze, Resistance, H2O and Boston/New York Hip-hop group Special Teamz (Slaine, Ed O.G., Jaysaun, DJ Jayceeoh), they comprise a part of New York's DMS Crew. Vocalist Cricien and bass player Hoya are also in the band Hazen Street, along with members of H2O and Cro-Mags.\n\nIn 2010, after the departure of the Ferret Records owners from the label, Madball followed them to their new and present label Good Fight Music. In February 2010 Madball signed a deal with Nuclear Blast for the European release of their new studio album, \"Empire\", produced by Erik Rutan. Jay Weinberg, son of E Street Band and Max Weinberg 7 drummer Max Weinberg, joined Madball for the album and for touring.\n\nMadball then dismissed Weinberg in September 2010, citing personality conflicts. Weinberg said that he had already quit the group by that time, due to lifestyle issues. Born From Pain drummer Igor Wouters replaced Weinberg for live performances.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, it was announced the band had begun recording its eighth studio album, \"Hardcore Lives\", which was released in June of that year.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Brian \"Mitts\" Daniels had exited Madball.\n\nMadball released their ninth studio album, \"For the Cause\", on June 15, 2018.\n\nIn January 2019, Madball announced that their touring guitarist, Mike Gurnari, would become an official member.\n\nStudio albums\n\nEPs\n\n\n"}

He rose to be a powerful boss of Palermo's Passo di Rigano family. A prolific heroin trafficker, he was killed in May 1981 by the Corleonesi of Totò Riina in the Second Mafia War who opposed the established Palermo Mafia families of which Inzerillo was one of the main proponents.\n\nInzerillo was born in Palermo.

Inzerillo acted without asking permission from the Mafia Commission to prove he could commit a murder in rival territory (that of Giuseppe Calò) just as the Corleonesi.\n\nOn 11 May 1981, Inzerillo was gunned down in Palermo as he strolled towards his recently acquired bullet-proof car after leaving the house of his mistress. He was rendered almost unrecognizable by a hail of bullets from a machine gun. The firearm used was an AK-47, the same gun that killed Bontade the previous month. The deaths of these two powerful mafiosi kick-started the Second Mafia War that lasted almost two-years and saw hundreds of mafiosi killed as Totò Riina and the Corleonesi decimated their rivals in order to take over Cosa Nostra by sheer brute force.\n\nIt is believed Inzerillo was murdered by Pino Greco, one of Riina's most lethal hitmen. At Inzerillo's funeral, his teenage son Giuseppe vowed to avenge his father, and not long afterwards the boy was kidnapped, tortured and killed. A number of informants, including Tommaso Buscetta, said that it was Pino Greco who abducted the youth and shot him through the head, but first hacked his arm off, symbolically removing the arm the youngster had vowed to shoot Riina with.\n\nSanto Inzerillo, the brother of Salvatore, was strangled on 26 May 1981, when he came to a meeting to ask clarifications about the killing of his relatives. One of the other brothers, Pietro Inzerillo subsequently turned up murdered in New Jersey, also in 1981.\n\n"}

The life-size bronze statue of a Trojan warrior stands in the center of campus and serves as a popular meeting spot, as well as a centerpiece for a number of campus events. It is the most popular unofficial mascot of the university.\n\nThe Trojan Shrine was sculpted by Roger Noble Burnham, who used USC football players such as Russ Saunders, Ernie Pinckert Henry Becker, Larry Stevens and John Ward as visual references for the statue. It was unveiled during the University's 50th Jubilee in 1930. It cost $10,000 to build, after which a $1 surcharge was added onto the season football tickets in order to help offset this cost.\n\nThe statue was created by Harold C. Swartz, a noted sculptor. Swartz exhibited extensively beginning in the early 1920s. He participated in all the major fine art exhibitions in Southern California and won many prizes. He was a member of the Sculptors Guild of Southern California and the California Art Club. Swartz had a solo exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1923. He exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1925 and 1929. Swartz designed several fountains for Hollywood celebrities, most notably Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. Large bronze sculptures were the centerpieces of these fountains.\n\nSwartz, like many artists in Los Angeles, did work for movie studios, including MGM. In many newspaper articles published around the end of World War II, Swartz is credited with the creation of the Oscar. This is disputed by all other historical sources. However, Swartz’s student George Stanley is officially credited with the design of the Oscar. Nonetheless, the style and technique of the Oscar is very similar to many of Swartz’s sculptures. His work “Dans Macabre” resembles the “Oscar.” This work was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1929 and a facsimile appears in a 1931 film called “Scandal Sheet.”\n\nSwartz was purely a modernist. He abstracted his subjects, employing cubist elements that were mildly surreal and often allegorical. Swartz’s works were received with great critical acclaim. He was also successful at executing realistic busts of well-known public figures, including Von Kliensmid, the president of the University of Southern California. He won a commission to create a bust of Theodore Roosevelt, which was located a local high school. Swartz also executed “Tommy Trojan,” a monumental sculpture of a Trojan warrior on the University of Southern California campus.\n\nThe original name suggested for the statue was The Spirit of Troy, but that name went to the school's marching band.\n\nOn August 17, 2017, during the USC village grand opening, the Hecuba, Queen of Troy statue was unveiled to the public. This large statue serves as the female counterpart to Tommy Trojan and represents the Women of USC.\n\nTommy Trojan is located at the core of the campus and often serves as a meeting ground for students and visitors. Many people take pictures with the statue. The Shrine is surrounded by the Bovard Administration Building, Ronald Tutor Campus Center, and Alumni Park. Trousdale Parkway passes next to the statue. USC offers the Tommy Cam, which is a live image of the statue, with daily time-lapse videos. Inscribed on the base of the statue are the five attributes of the ideal Trojan: Faithful, Scholarly, Skillful, Courageous and Ambitious. On the reverse is a plaque bearing a quote by Virgil: \"Here are provided seats of meditative joy, where shall rise again the destined reign of Troy.\"\n\nUSC's cross-town rival UCLA had vandalized Tommy Trojan (often by painting the statue in the UCLA colors of blue and gold) during the week of the annual USC-UCLA football game. To prevent this, university officials now cover the statue during that week to protect it from UCLA vandals. Students also gather for Save Tommy Nite on the night before the game against UCLA. In addition, members of the Trojan Knights maintain an all-night vigil around Tommy Trojan during the rivalry week to further deter would-be vandals.\n\nMany people identify Tommy Trojan as the symbol of the university. However, Tommy Trojan is not USC's official mascot; that title belongs to Traveler, a white Andalusian horse. Before Traveler, a real local dog named George Tirebiter served as the unofficial mascot. A statue of the dog is also a feature of the campus.\n\n"}
{"id": "2138485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138485", "title": "Darkbuster", "text": "Darkbuster\n\nDarkbuster is a punk rock band hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, known largely for their songs about the joys of heavy drinking, which have earned them a strong following in the American Northeast. The band occasionally performs under the name of P Diddler And The Fearsome Foursome.\n\nThe band was formed by singer/guitarist Lenny Lashley, drummer Eric Edmonston, and bassist Mike Gurley in 1996 and developed a following around Massachusetts. In 1997 the band recorded a nine-song demo tape, and in 1999 released their debut album, \"22 Songs You'll Never Want To Hear Again!\" The album instantly cemented their reputation in the Boston punk scene, filled with songs about beer, being a loser, and even a few juvenile-but-hilarious potshots at other local bands (and even the group's own members). Shortly after they released a split EP titled Skullbuster with the Skullys a high school punk band from Stoughton, MA they often gigged with. Songs include: \"Waste of Life,\" \"Join the NRA,\" and \"Some Cunt Sneezed on my Sub\".\n\nIn 2000 the band added a second guitarist, Paul Delano. In addition, Danny O'Halloran replaced Edmonston as the group's drummer a few months later, and it was this lineup of Lashley, Gurley, Delano, and O'Halloran which won the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble that year.\n\nIn 2001 the band recorded five songs for a split EP with Tommy and the Terrors. The new songs received mixed reviews from the group's fans, some of whom felt that the new songs were \"too serious.\" Lashley decided to break up the band the same week, following a grinding month-long U.S. tour. \n\nLashley continued writing songs and formed a country band, Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys, in 2002, which developed an audience of its own. Gurley moved on to The U.S.M., then to The McGunks. O'Halloran joined The Marvels, and Delano joined Avoid One Thing. Following his departure from the band, Edmonston formed a group called Linus.\n\nIn May 2005, Lashley injured his left hand in a construction accident at Boston University, leaving him unable to play guitar for several months. The band temporarily brought Amy Griffin (Raging Teens/Avoid One Thing) on board as a second guitarist. A DVD containing concert footage of Darkbuster and Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys was released shortly after the accident, with proceeds set aside to help Lashley with his medical bills. A 2005 benefit concert featuring both of Lashley's bands performing with guest singers also raised money to help cover his medical bills. Shortly after in December 2005, it was announced that Edmonston would again be leaving the band at the end of the year, with Griffin becoming a full member and Lashley returning to guitar duties.\n\nIn May 2006 the band signed with I Scream Records, who re-released \"A Weakness For Spirits\" in August 2006. The band was rumored to be compiling footage for a 10th anniversary DVD.\n\nDarkbuster band members have participated in various side projects during their active years as well as their moments of hiatus. In July 2005 Gurley and Edmonston released an album entitled \"90 Miles From Launch To Target\" from their side project band, Drago. In October 2006 Lashley's country band Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys released their eponymous debut album on Lude Boy Records. Unfortunately, John Erik Johnson, the bass player for Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys and the Bourbonaires, died on January 17, 2007. Lenny Lashley continued to make music with his solo project Lenny Lashley's Gang of One as well as Street Dogs.\n\nAlthough an official breakup was never announced, the band stopped performing and went on a hiatus. It wasn't until December 27, 2009, that Darkbuster played their first show in almost two years at Boston's House Of Blues for the 12th Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Hometown Throwdown.\n\nIn 2015, after eight years of recording, Darkbuster released \"No Revolution\" under \"Pirate Press Records\". The release was paired with several sold-out nights of \"Reunion\" concerts in August 2015. Unfortunately, many of the original members were not involved in the performances.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2138489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138489", "title": "Color TV-Game", "text": "Color TV-Game\n\nBy the late 1970s, Nintendo began moving away from toys and playing cards and into the rapidly-growing video game market. Their decision was based on the release of the hugely-successful arcade game \"Space Invaders\" by Taito and the 1973 oil crisis making toys expensive to produce. Nintendo's first foray into the industry was \"Computer Othello\" in 1975. They followed it with games such as \"Sheriff\", \"Space Fever\", and \"EVR-Race\". Most of these were unsuccessful but made Nintendo view video games as the next market to jump into. The home console market also saw a rise in popularity, particularly in North America with the release of Atari's \"Pong\" system in 1975. This caused the market to become flooded with similar \"video tennis\" games as companies scrambled to cash in on its success. Nintendo was no exception, and decided to make their own dedicated \"Pong\" system as a way to bring its popularity over to Japan.\n\nThe Color TV-Game consoles were produced jointly by Nintendo Research & Development 2 (R&D2) and Mitsubishi Electronics. Nintendo had no prior knowledge of manufacturing electronics, so they enlisted the help of Mitsubishi to mass-produce them. Mitsubishi previously assisted Nintendo in production of \"EVR Race\", which provided a good relationship between the two companies. For the first two consoles, Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15, Nintendo acquired a license from Magnavox that allowed them to produce their own \"Pong\"-esc game consoles. Magnavox created the original concept for \"Pong\" for their Magnavox Odyssey console, which inspired Atari to create a similar game for arcades. This angered Magnavox founder Ralph H. Baer, who sued Atari for infringing on their rights. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi specified that the consoles had to be produced quickly and with cheaper parts to lower production costs. He wanted the systems to be cheap for the consumer to purchase to give them an edge over their rivals. The TV-Game 6 and 15 required little production time due to their simplicity. Mitsubishi made minor changes and corrections to the systems before they were released.\n\nThe Color TV-Game 6 launched on June 1, 1977. It retailed at a price of ¥9,800, which was significantly lower than competing systems. Nintendo used this as a marketing tool. As its title implies, it contains six variations of \"Pong\", such as adding additional paddles, decreasing the size of the paddles, and adding deflective shields in the center of the screen. It could be powered by batteries or by a power adapter that was sold separately. Shortly after its release, Nintendo released an improved version of the TV-Game 6, featuring a cream-white outer casing and removing the power adapter. A second variation was produced as part of a promotion with food company House Foods to promote their House Shanmen instant noodles. It is identical to the original TV-Game 6 but has the House Shanmen logo on the casing. This version was produced in very limited quantities, making it extremely rare. Sharp Electronics produced dark orange-colored versions of the TV-Game 6 to bundle with their television sets.\nA week later on June 8, Nintendo released the Color TV-Game 15. It retailed for ¥15,000, roughly 50% more than the TV-Game 6. In a sense, the TV-Game 15 was a re-release of the TV Game 6; the latter had fifteen games, but only six were playable out of the box. The TV-Game 15 has detachable controllers which are stored in a small compartment on the system. Nintendo produced a second model of the TV-Game 15 with a reddish-orange casing, which had a longer production run and as such are more common than the orange version. Sharp made a white-colored version that was renamed \"Color TV-Game XG-115\".\n\nThe third unit, the Color TV Game Racing 112, was published on June 8, 1978. It is significantly larger than the previous two units, with a larger shipping box to accompany it. Racing 112 was set to be released at ¥18,000, but was lowered to ¥12,000 to ensure competitiveness. It was later reduced to ¥5,000. To prevent the machine from requiring a larger box, the wheel is detachable from the console. The built-in game is a top-down racer similar to \"Speed Race\", an arcade game released by Taito in 1974. Variations include a smaller screen width and opponents that move faster, with all possible game combinations totaling to 112. The console also comes with two paddle controllers that allow for multiplayer. It was followed by the Color TV Game Block Kuzushi, released at ¥13,500 on April 23, 1979. The system was produced in-house by Nintendo, allowing their name to be prominently displayed. Block Kuzushi includes six variations of \"Breakout\", an arcade game released in America by Atari. Nintendo themselves released a clone of \"Breakout\" titled \"Block Fever\" for Japanese arcades in 1978. Rival company Epoch released the \"TV Block\" console in Japan, which was successful and gave way to steady competition by other companies, including Nintendo. The system's casing was designed by \"Mario\" creator Shigeru Miyamoto. It is one of his first video game projects after joining Nintendo in 1977. The built-in games for Racing 112 and Block Kuzushi were designed by Takehiro Izushi. Nintendo held competitions in department stores to promote the Block Kuzushi, where winners received a congratulatory note and a medal.\n\nThe final console, the Computer TV Game, was released in 1980. As dedicated consoles were decreasing in popularity, the Computer TV Game was only produced in limited quantities, making it extremely rare. Miyamoto again designed the system's white-colored casing as well as the packaging. It was produced in house as well with no help from outside companies. Computer TV-Game contains a port of \"Computer Othello\", and is built right around an original \"Computer Othello\" arcade system board. This makes it an arcade-perfect rendition, an uncommon sight during the early 1980's. The entire Color TV-Game series was discontinued in favor of the Family Computer in 1983, a cartridge-based system that could play hundreds of games. The Famicom, and its international counterpart the Nintendo Entertainment System, sold millions and solidified Nintendo's presence in the video game hardware market.\n\nThe Color TV-Game series was very successful for Nintendo, and was a commercial hit. The Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15 sold one million units each. Racing 112 and Block Kuzushi sold half a million units each. Their success prompted Nintendo to continue pursuing the video game console market, which inevitably lead to the creation of the Family Computer and the Nintendo Entertainment System. Publications have recognized it as being Nintendo's first video game consoles. Erik Voskuil, writing for his blog \"Before Mario\", believes that part of the reason the Color TV-Game series was successful was for its low price point, far cheaper than the competition. He wrote that: \"Almost thirty-five years and multiple generations of ever improving, multi-million selling Nintendo video game consoles on, we can reflect on this moment as the beginning of something very, very big.\" In his 2004 book \"Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life\", Chris Kohler claims that the colorful casing played a part in the systems performing well, saying they resembled toys more than video game consoles. Luke Plunkett of \"Kotaku\" acknowledged the consoles for their importance as Nintendo's first foray into the market, and for it being influential for their next system. Plunkett agreed with Voskuil in the series being successful for their low price, as it established Nintendo's \"consoles must be sold at a profit\" attitude that continues today. \"PC Magazine\"s Benj Edwards that the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15 units in particular gave Nintendo faith in the market due to their commercial success. He also noted that the Block Kuzushi marked the debut of Shigeru Miyamoto, an important figure within the company.\n\nNintendo has referenced the Color TV-Game systems and their built-in games in other franchises. \"Alleyway\", a launch title for the Game Boy, is believed to be based on the Color TV-Game Block Kuzushi. Journalist Jeremy Parish went as far to say that \"Alleyway\" is a throwback to Block Kuzushi, due to it having been cemented in Nintendo's corporate roots. \"\" includes a minigame based on \"Racing 112\", where the player has five seconds to dodge the moving cars. It is part of 9-Volt's stage, which comprises minigames featuring older Nintendo video games. A Color TV-Game 6 minigame appears in 9-Volt and 18-Volt's stage in \"\". An assist trophy based on the TV-Game 15 appears in \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" and its follow-up \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\". When summoned, it spawns a pair of paddles that launch a ball across the level, which will inflict damage on fighters that touch it.\n"}

{"id": "2138501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138501", "title": "Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene", "text": "Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene\n\nUltra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, UHMW) is a subset of the thermoplastic polyethylene. Also known as high-modulus polyethylene, (HMPE), it has extremely long chains, with a molecular mass usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The longer chain serves to transfer load more effectively to the polymer backbone by strengthening intermolecular interactions. This results in a very tough material, with the highest impact strength of any thermoplastic presently made.\n\nUHMWPE is odorless, tasteless, and nontoxic. It embodies all the characteristics of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with the added traits of being resistant to concentrated acids and alkalis, as well as numerous organic solvents. It is highly resistant to corrosive chemicals except oxidizing acids; has extremely low moisture absorption and a very low coefficient of friction; is self-lubricating (see boundary lubrication); and is highly resistant to abrasion, in some forms being 15 times more resistant to abrasion than carbon steel. Its coefficient of friction is significantly lower than that of nylon and acetal and is comparable to that of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon), but UHMWPE has better abrasion resistance than PTFE.\n\nPolymerization of UHMWPE was commercialized in the 1950s by Ruhrchemie AG, which has changed names over the years. Today UHMWPE powder materials, which may be directly molded into a product's final shape, are produced by Ticona, Braskem, DSM, Teijin (Endumax), Celanese, and Mitsui. Processed UHMWPE is available commercially either as fibers or in consolidated form, such as sheets or rods. Because of its resistance to wear and impact, UHMWPE continues to find increasing industrial applications, including the automotive and bottling sectors. Since the 1960s, UHMWPE has also been the material of choice for total joint arthroplasty in orthopedic and spine implants.\n\nUHMWPE fibers, commercialized in the late 1970s by the Dutch chemical company DSM, are widely used in ballistic protection, defense applications, and increasingly in medical devices.\n\nUHMWPE is a type of polyolefin. It is made up of extremely long chains of polyethylene, which all align in the same direction. It derives its strength largely from the length of each individual molecule (chain). Van der Waals bonds between the molecules are relatively weak for each atom of overlap between the molecules, but because the molecules are very long, large overlaps can exist, adding up to the ability to carry larger shear forces from molecule to molecule. Each chain is bonded to the others with so many van der Waals bonds that the whole of the inter-molecular strength is high. In this way, large tensile loads are not limited as much by the comparative weakness of each van der Waals bond.\n\nWhen formed into fibers, the polymer chains can attain a parallel orientation greater than 95% and a level of crystallinity from 39% to 75%. In contrast, Kevlar derives its strength from strong bonding between relatively short molecules.\n\nThe weak bonding between olefin molecules allows local thermal excitations to disrupt the crystalline order of a given chain piece-by-piece, giving it much poorer heat resistance than other high-strength fibers. Its melting point is around , and, according to DSM, it is not advisable to use UHMWPE fibres at temperatures exceeding for long periods of time. It becomes brittle at temperatures below .\n\nThe simple structure of the molecule also gives rise to surface and chemical properties that are rare in high-performance polymers. For example, the polar groups in most polymers easily bond to water. Because olefins have no such groups, UHMWPE does not absorb water readily, nor wet easily, which makes bonding it to other polymers difficult. For the same reasons, skin does not interact with it strongly, making the UHMWPE fiber surface feel slippery. In a similar manner, aromatic polymers are often susceptible to aromatic solvents due to aromatic stacking interactions, an effect aliphatic polymers like UHMWPE are immune to. Since UHMWPE does not contain chemical groups (such as esters, amides or hydroxylic groups) that are susceptible to attack from aggressive agents, it is very resistant to water, moisture, most chemicals, UV radiation, and micro-organisms.\n\nUnder tensile load, UHMWPE will deform continually as long as the stress is present—an effect called \"creep\".\n\nWhen UHMWPE is annealed, the material is heated to 135 °C to 138 °C in an oven or a liquid bath of silicone oil or glycerine. The material is then cooled down at a rate of 5 °C/h to 65 °C or less. Finally, the material is wrapped in an insulating blanket for 24 hours to bring to room temperature.\n\n\"Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene\" (UHMWPE) is synthesized from its monomer ethylene, which is bonded together to form the base polyethylene product. These molecules are several orders of magnitude longer than those of familiar high-density polyethylene (HDPE) due to a synthesis process based on metallocene catalysts, resulting in UHMWPE molecules typically having 100,000 to 250,000 monomer units per molecule each compared to HDPE's 700 to 1,800 monomers.\n\nUHMWPE is processed variously by compression moulding, ram extrusion, gel spinning, and sintering. Several European companies began compression molding UHMW in the early 1960s. Gel-spinning arrived much later and was intended for different applications.\n\nIn gel spinning a precisely heated gel of UHMWPE is extruded through a spinneret. The extrudate is drawn through the air and then cooled in a water bath. The end-result is a fiber with a high degree of molecular orientation, and therefore exceptional tensile strength. Gel spinning depends on isolating individual chain molecules in the solvent so that intermolecular entanglements are minimal. Entanglements make chain orientation more difficult, and lower the strength of the final product.\n\nDyneema and Spectra are lightweight high-strength oriented-strand gels spun through a spinneret. They have yield strengths as high as 2.4 GPa (2.4 kN/mm or 350,000 psi) and density as low as 0.97 g/cm (for Dyneema SK75). High-strength steels have comparable yield strengths, and low-carbon steels have yield strengths much lower (around 0.5 GPa). Since steel has a specific gravity of roughly 7.8, these materials have a strength-to-weight ratios eight times that of high-strength steels. Strength-to-weight ratios for Dyneema are about 40% higher than for aramid. Dyneema was invented by Albert Pennings in 1963 but made commercially available by DSM in 1990.\n\nUHMWPE are used as composite plates in armor, in particular, personal armor and on occasion as vehicle armor. \nCivil applications containing UHMWPE fibers are cut-resistant gloves, bow strings, climbing equipment, fishing line, spear lines for spearguns, high-performance sails, suspension lines on sport parachutes and paragliders, rigging in yachting, kites, and kites lines for kites sports.\n\nFor personal armor, the fibers are, in general, aligned and bonded into sheets, which are then layered at various angles to give the resulting composite material strength in all directions. Recently developed additions to the US Military's Interceptor body armor, designed to offer arm and leg protection, are said to utilize a form of Spectra or Dyneema fabric. Dyneema provides puncture resistance to protective clothing in the sport of fencing.\n\nSpun UHMWPE fibers excel as fishing line, as they have less stretch, are more abrasion-resistant, and are thinner than traditional monofilament line.\n\nIn climbing, cord and webbing made of combinations of UHMWPE and nylon yarn have gained popularity for their low weight and bulk. They exhibit very low elasticity compared to their nylon counterparts. Also, low elasticity translates to low toughness. The fiber's very high lubricity leads to poor knot-holding ability, and is mostly used in pre-sewn 'slings' (loops of webbing) — relying on knots to join sections of UHMWPE is generally not recommended, and if necessary it is recommended to use the triple fisherman's knot rather than the traditional double fisherman's knot.\n\nShips' hawsers and cables made from the fiber (0.97 specific gravity) float on sea water. \"Spectra Wires\" as they are called in the towing boat community are commonly used for face wires as a lighter alternative to steel wires.\n\nIt is used in skis and snowboards, often in combination with carbon fiber, reinforcing the fiberglass composite material, adding stiffness and improving its flex characteristics. The UHMWPE is often used as the base layer, which contacts the snow, and includes abrasives to absorb and retain wax.\n\nIt is also used in lifting applications for manufacturing low weight, and heavy duty lifting slings. Due to its extreme abrasion resistance it is also used as an excellent corner protection for synthetic lifting slings.\n\nHigh-performance lines (such as backstays) for sailing and parasailing are made of UHMWPE, due to their low stretch, high strength, and low weight. Similarly, Dyneema is often used for winch-launching gliders from the ground, as, in comparison with steel cable, its superior abrasion resistance results in less wear when running along the ground and into the winch, increasing the time between failures.\n\nDyneema was used for the 30-kilometre space tether in the ESA/Russian Young Engineers' Satellite 2 of September, 2007.\n\nDyneema Composite Fabric (DCF) is a laminated material consisting of a grid of Dyneema threads sandwiched between two thin transparent polyester membranes. This material is very strong for its weight, and was originally developed for use in racing yacht sails under the name 'Cuben Fiber'. More recently it has found new applications, most notably in the manufacture of lightweight and ultralight camping and backpacking equipment such as tents and backpacks.\n\nIn archery, UHMWPE is widely used as a material for bowstrings because of its low creep and stretch compared to, for example, Dacron (PET). Besides pure UHMWPE fibers, most manufacturers use blends to further reduce the creep and stretch of the material. In these blends, the UHMWPE fibers are blended with, for example, Vectran.\n\nIn skydiving, Spectra is one of the most common materials used for suspension lines, largely supplanting the earlier-used Dacron, being lighter and less bulky. Spectra has excellent strength and wear-resistance, but is not dimensionally stable (i.e. shrinks) when exposed to heat, which leads to gradual and uneven shrinkage of different lines as they are subject to differing amounts of friction during canopy deployment, necessitating periodic line replacement. It is also almost completely inelastic, which can exacerbate the opening shock. For that reason, Dacron (PET) lines continue to be used in student and some tandem systems, where the added bulk is less of a concern than the potential for an injurious opening. In turn, in high performance parachutes used for swooping, Spectra is replaced with Vectran and HMA (high-modulus aramid), which are even thinner and dimensionally stable, but exhibit greater wear and require much more frequent maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Spectra / Dyneema are also used for reserve parachute closing loops when used with automatic activation devices, where their extremely low coefficient of friction is critical for proper operation in the event of cutter activation.\n\nUHMWPE has a clinical history as a biomaterial for use in hip, knee, and (since the 1980s), for spine implants. An online repository of information and review articles related to medical grade UHMWPE, known as the UHMWPE Lexicon, was started online in 2000.\n\nJoint replacement components have historically been made from \"GUR\" resins. These powder materials are produced by Ticona, typically converted into semi-forms by companies such as Quadrant and Orthoplastics, and then machined into implant components and sterilized by device manufacturers.\n\nUHMWPE was first used clinically in 1962 by Sir John Charnley and emerged as the dominant bearing material for total hip and knee replacements in the 1970s.\nThroughout its history, there were unsuccessful attempts to modify UHMWPE to improve its clinical performance until the development of highly cross-linked UHMWPE in the late 1990s.\n\nOne unsuccessful attempt to modify UHMWPE was by blending the powder with carbon fibers. This reinforced UHMWPE was released clinically as \"Poly Two\" by Zimmer in the 1970s. The carbon fibers had poor compatibility with the UHMWPE matrix and its clinical performance was inferior to virgin UHMWPE.\n\nA second attempt to modify UHMWPE was by high-pressure recrystallization. This recrystallized UHMWPE was released clinically as \"Hylamer\" by DePuy in the late 1980s. When gamma irradiated in air, this material exhibited susceptibility to oxidation, resulting in inferior clinical performance relative to virgin UHMWPE. Today, the poor clinical history of Hylamer is largely attributed to its sterilization method, and there has been a resurgence of interest in studying this material (at least among certain research circles). Hylamer fell out of favor in the United States in the late 1990s with the development of highly cross-linked UHMWPE materials, however negative clinical reports from Europe about Hylamer continue to surface in the literature.\n\nHighly cross-linked UHMWPE materials were clinically introduced in 1998 and have rapidly become the standard of care for total hip replacements, at least in the United States. These new materials are cross-linked with gamma or electron beam radiation (50–105 kGy) and then thermally processed to improve their oxidation resistance. Five-year clinical data, from several centers, are now available demonstrating their superiority relative to conventional UHMWPE for total hip replacement (see arthroplasty). Clinical studies are still underway to investigate the performance of highly cross-linked UHMWPE for knee replacement.\n\nIn 2007, manufacturers started incorporating anti-oxidants into UHMWPE for hip and knee arthroplasty bearing surfaces. Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) is the most common anti-oxidant used in radiation-cross-linked UHMWPE for medical applications. The anti-oxidant helps quench free radicals that are introduced during the irradiation process, imparting improved oxidation resistance to the UHMWPE without the need for thermal treatment. Several companies have been selling antioxidant-stabilized joint replacement technologies since 2007, using both synthetic vitamin E as well as hindered phenol-based antioxidants.\n\nAnother important medical advancement for UHMWPE in the past decade has been the increase in use of fibers for sutures. Medical-grade fibers for surgical applications are produced by DSM under the \"Dyneema Purity\" trade name.\n\nUHMWPE is used in the manufacture of PVC (vinyl) windows and doors, as it can endure the heat required to soften the PVC-based materials and is used as a form/chamber filler for the various PVC shape profiles in order for those materials to be 'bent' or shaped around a template.\n\nUHMWPE is also used in the manufacture of hydraulic seals and bearings. It is best suited for medium mechanical duties in water, oil hydraulics, pneumatics, and unlubricated applications. It has a good abrasion resistance but is better suited to soft mating surfaces.\n\nFluoropolymer / HMWPE insulation cathodic protection cable is typically made with dual insulation. It features a primary layer of a fluoropolymer such as ECTFE which is chemically resistant to chlorine, sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Following the primary layer is an HMWPE insulation layer, which provides pliable strength and allows considerable abuse during installation. The HMWPE jacketing provides mechanical protection as well.\n\nUHMWPE is used in marine structures for the mooring of ships and floating structures in general. The UHMWPE forms the contact surface between the floating structure and the fixed one. Timber was and is used for this application also.\nUHMWPE is chosen as facing of fender systems for berthing structures because of the following characteristics :\n\n\n"}

It is particularly associated with Prussia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian \"Landsturm\" was a reserve force that consisted of men aged 34 to 55. It was intended to provide replacements for the front line units and provide a militia for local defense. It was divided into the Austrian K.u.K. (\"Kaiserlich und Königlich\", \"Imperial and Royal\") Landsturm and the Hungarian Kgl. (\"Königlich\", \"Royal\") Landsturm.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Austrian Landsturm formed 40 regiments totaling 136 battalions in Austria and the Hungarian Landsturm formed 32 regiments totaling 97 battalions. They provided 20 Brigades who took to the field with the rest of the army.\n\nIn Prussia after the of 21 April 1813 all the male population from ages 15 to 60 who were capable of military service, who were not in the standing army or the \"Landwehr\", had to respond to the orders of the \"Landsturm\". It effectively formed the last national military reserve.\n\nKing Frederick William III of Prussia established the Prussian \"Landsturm\" as irregular military forces on 21 April 1813 by royal edict – the decree appeared in the \"\" (German: Prussian Code of Law) (pp. 79–89). The 1813 edict called for resistance \"by any means\" against the Napoleonic invasion. As a model and an explicit example, it took the Spanish \"Reglamento de Partidas y Cuadrillas\" of 28 December 1808 and the decree of 17 April 1809, known as \"Corso Terrestre\", during the Peninsula War against Napoleonic troops (ref. the introduction, §8, §52).\n\nAccording to this edict, all Prussian citizens were obliged to oppose the invasion by the enemy using any weapons available, like axes, pitchforks, scythes or shotguns (§43). All Prussians were further encouraged to not obey orders by the enemy, but rather to make themselves a nuisance to the Napoleonic troops however possible. This was a clear departure from ordinary \"jus in bello\" (Latin for Law of War), which commanded the civilian population to obey the orders of the occupying power, and the police forces to assist the occupying power in crushing any uprising. It did not qualify as an insurgency, but simply as criminal activity. The \"Landsturm\" edict explicitly stated that it was preferable to risk the danger brought about by the furies of an armed population rather than to let the enemy have control over the situation. \"Légitime défense\" \"justified the use of all means\" (§7), including chaos.\n\nThe edict was modified less than three months later on 17 July 1813 and was purified of its subversive content relative to the laws of war. The war then took place according to the standard rules of conventional warfare. Carl Schmitt qualified it as the \"Magna Carta of the partisan\". Despite its not being put to practice, fascist jurists considered it in a 1962 lecture in Francoist Spain to be the \"official document of the legitimation of the partisan of national defense\" and as the \"philosophical discovery of the partisan.\"\n\nThe North German Confederation Act of 9 November 1867 about the obligation for wartime military service and the Reich law about the \"Landsturm\" of 12 February 1875 restricted the obligation to the period from 17 to 42 years of age.\n\nIn the Bavarian Army the oldest ages for compulsory military service since the army reform of 1868 was referred to as the \"Landsturm\".\n\nIn February 1808, Russia invaded Swedish Finland and on 14 March Denmark-Norway declared war on Sweden, starting the Finnish War. On the very same day of the Danish declaration of war, Gustav IV Adolf, the Swedish king, issue a decree that ordered the formation of a new military unit, called \"Lantvärnet\", which is the Swedish name for \"landwehr\". The decree stated that all able unmarried men between 18 and 25 would become eligible to be conscripted for service in lantvärnet. The plan was that lantvärnet would consist of 60,000 men, almost at par with the standing army that numbered 66,000 men. However, in reality, lantvärnet consisted of only circa 30,000 men. The soldiers of lantvärnet were poorly equipped and they only received their pay on an irregular basis. This led to low morale amongst the men. After the war had ended the common people had a very negative view on lantvärnet and conscription. Lantvärnet was abolished in 1811. Some believe that the popular resistance against conscription caused by the neagtive experiences of lantvärnet lived on for many years and was one of the main causes that Sweden didn't reintroduce conscription until 1901.\n\nIn 1885, the Swedish parliament passed a law that formed \"Landstormen\". All able Swedish males between 27 and 32 would serve in landstormen as a territorial defence force in case of war. Landstormen however then only existed in theory and lacked any organization, only in the case of war were the Swedish Army to prepare plans and organizations for the landstorm. In 1892 the law was changed, and all men between 33 and 40 would serve in Landstormen in case of war. In 1901 Sweden introduced conscription, and became a proper second line unit, organizing the elder conscripted men (those between 33 and 40), and were tasked with territorial defence as well as securing the mobilization of the field army. In 1914 the law was changed and landstormen was to organize all men between 35 and 42. Also a mandatory 5 days refresher training was mandated for all those that belonged to landstormen. During World War I, Landstormen was frequently mobilized to secure the Swedish neutrality.\n\nLandstormen was again mobilized during World War II. In 1942 the Swedish Army went through a major re-organization and landstormen was abolished and incorporated into the regular army.\n\nIn the Swiss Army, the Landsturm was, until 1995, the third age class (men from 42–50) after the Elite (men from 18–32) and the Landwehr (men from 32–42).\n\n"}

It continues \"The Book of the Long Sun\" (1993–1996): they share a narrator and \"Short Sun\" recounts a search for Silk, the \"Long Sun\" hero. The two works are set in the same universe as \"The Book of the New Sun\" series that Wolfe inaugurated in 1980 and the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB) catalogs all three as sub-series of the \"Solar Cycle\", along with some other writings.\n\n\"Locus: The Magazine of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Field\" considered the three \"Short Sun\" volumes separately for annual \"Best Novel\" awards.\n\nThe \"Short Sun\" of the title is an ordinary star, in contrast to the \"Long Sun\" of the Whorl where the narrator grew up. Most of the story takes place in a star system with two habitable planets, Blue and Green, which lend their names to the first two volumes. The Whorl of volume three's title is the generation ship setting of \"Long Sun\".\n\nThe Tor hardcover editions (see table) were almost 1200 pages long in sum.\n\nScience Fiction Book Club released a 752-page omnibus edition only two months after the third volume was published.\n\nThe story, which is told by a narrator who identifies himself as Horn (the ostensible author of \"The Book of the Long Sun\"), is an account of a search \"on three worlds\" for Silk, the hero of the \"Long Sun\" cycle. However, the narrator's adventures continue as he writes, so that the manuscript is both a memoir of his past and a journal of his present. As the story progresses, the narrator's identity becomes increasingly complex and elusive. The writing style changes with each book, and the story is highly nonlinear, with narrative threads from different times told in parallel and story events related out of order as the narrator remembers or confronts them. As with many of Wolfe's novels, the narrator and the circumstances under which the book is being written are essential to understanding the story.\n\nMost of the story takes place in a star system with two habitable planets, Blue and Green (named for their appearance as seen from space). The human inhabitants arrived in the system after several centuries on an O'Neill-style generation starship called the \"Whorl\", which is still in orbit, where some of the events take place. The \"Short Sun\" of the title is an ordinary star, and is named thus in contrast with the \"Long Sun\" the narrator grew up with, running along the axis of the Whorl.\n\n\nAs the book opens, the narrator, apparently Horn, is the Rajan of Gaon on Blue, acting as a sort of judge and mayor. He is attempting to set down how his adventure began: he was approached by the leaders of New Viron, who had received a letter from the \"Men of PAJAROCU\", a distant city, stating that they had a working lander and would be returning to the Whorl. Horn was asked to find them and go with them, in search of Caldé Silk, who (it was hoped) would bring order to the lawlessness and chaos of New Viron. In pursuit of this quest, he set off in a small boat toward the western continent he called Shadelow, joined, eventually, by Seawrack, Babbie, Sinew, and Krait. That narrative thread ends when he has reached Pajarocu and boarded the lander.\n\nIn alternating chapters, more or less, the Rajan of Gaon describes his current situation: the war his city is fighting against Han, a nearby city, his de facto imprisonment in Gaon, and his extensive dealings with inhumi and a critical secret he learned about them. He eventually escapes from Gaon with the help of one of his concubines, Evensong, and ends the first book in the wilderness.\n\nThe book opens as the narrator is approaching the city of Blanko, where he is taken in by Inclito and his family. Small mysteries are related and solved in stories shared by the members of the household, and the narrator (now called Incanto, to conceal his identity) elliptically relates his tragic adventures on Green after the Pajarocu lander was diverted there. It is during these stories that he first discovers a strange thing: the inhumi, when he is near, can send spirits to distant places in (near) physical form, just as the Vanished People apparently can. In this way, Incanto and his companions explore Green and the original Red Sun Whorl.\n\nBlanko, too, is swept up in war, and Incanto again aids them in their fight, discovering that his son Hide, who does not recognize him, is fighting alongside them while searching the world for his missing father. When the book ends, he, Hide, and his new \"daughter\" Jahlee (an inhuma) have left Blanko, and are on the road back to New Viron; the ending of the parallel story on Green is left uncertain.\n\n\"Return to the Whorl\" alternates between the narrator's first-person adventures on his way home and a third-person account of his travels on the Whorl, which he visited after Green. This third-person story is ostensibly penned by Hide, Hoof, Daisy, and Vadsig. Near the end, there is a section written by Hoof alone, and the very last pages are written by Daisy.\n\nOn the Whorl, the Long Sun has been blown out temporarily, and the world is in near-total darkness. The narrator encounters Pig and Hound, and with them travels to the ruins of Blood's mansion (where Mucor appears to them), and then to Old Viron. In the Caldé's Palace, he finds Maytera Marble's half-finished daughter Olivine, who donates one of her eyes for her mother; the narrator will eventually echo this gift by donating one of his own to Pig at the West Pole. The leadership of Old Viron, threatened by his reappearance, arranges with Hari Mau of Gaon to have him returned to Blue — at which point the narrative connects with the opening of \"On Blue's Waters\".\n\nFor much of the first-person account, the narrator is imprisoned on Blue in a town called Dorp on trumped-up charges, and must use his various powers to foment a revolution against the unjust judges who rule the town. In the course of this effort, he again visits the Red Sun Whorl, where he meets a young Severian and inspires him to write a book. Once free, he returns to Lizard and New Viron, where the final riddle of his identity is solved, and helps defend against a massive attack of inhumi during Hide's wedding. When the book ends, he and his companions (Nettle, Seawrack, Oreb, and Marble) have apparently returned finally to the Whorl, which then departs for the stars.\n\n\n"}

Very few pins are needed (in most cases, only at the two edges.)\n\nThe very early bobbin laces were probably made freehand, as pins were scarce, coarse, and expensive. At first, the laces were purely utilitarian: “seaming” laces (insertions) joining narrow widths of fabric, and toothed or scalloped laces reinforcing the edges (edgings). Many of the later freehand laces were also functional, but some areas produced very wide ornamental laces.\n\nTraces of freehand lace can be found nearly everywhere: they were part of the textiles produced in pre-industrial communities. Production only survived in a few places, often because the lace was sold through handicraft organizations, when it no longer adorned the peasant costume and household textiles.\n\nThere are a few areas with a living tradition, like Dalarna and Skåne in Sweden, several areas in Slovakia, Cogne and Pescocostanzo in Italy, and Mikhailov in Russia.\n\nFreehand lace is dense compared to lace made on a pattern. Wide areas without pins can be constructed by using certain techniques: the different parts of the lace must be made in the right order, and a triple half stitch can be used to secure the threads instead of a pin.\n\nIn many areas, the laces are made wider by combining two or more patterns lengthwise. The lengths of the repeats are usually quite different.\n\nMany other laces have traits inherited from freehand lace, for example, the patterns and the working of the braids in Milanese lace, and the grounds without pins and the exchange of workers in linen stitch in some of the Flemish laces.\n\nThe term 'freehand lace' was first used as the translation of an Italian term in the English edition (1913) of Elisa Ricci's \"Antiche Trine Italiane\". It is called 'lace without a pattern' in French, 'numeric lace' in Russian, and the Slovaks have named it by the fact that it is produced on a bare pillow. In Swedish, the verb used for composing a poem is also used for making freehand lace.\n\nThe basic research on Freehand Lace was made by Bodil Tornehave of Denmark, and published in her book \"Danske Frihåndskniplinger\" (, Danish Freehand Lace) in 1987.\n\n'Freehand lace' is sometimes confused with 'free lace', which is a modern, artistic form of lace.\n"}

They are involved in collecting and reporting information to government bodies (for example, in the USA, the United States Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), to the public (e.g., Common Data Set, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities's University-College Accountability Network), and various college guide publishers (e.g., U.S. News & World Report and College Board). On occasion, institutional researchers share data with one another to compare their own practices and outcomes against those of similar institutions. Institutional research is the source of much of the information provided to regional and national accreditation bodies to document how institutions fulfill the standards for accreditation.\n\nIn addition to reporting, institutional researchers often engage in data analysis, ranging from simply testing whether differences in reported data are statistically significant to developing and using causal and predictive statistical models. Such models are often used in support of assessment and strategic enrollment management.\n\nDue to the need to provide data to the federal government and other entities, nearly every post-secondary institution has offices that fulfill the institutional research function. At some colleges and universities this function is centralized in a single office of institutional research, while at others it is more de-centralized. There is no single academic degree that qualifies one to be an institutional researcher, but suggested strengths include a knowledge of statistics, research methods (e.g., survey research and focus groups), and computer-based reporting and data visualization tools (e.g., SPSS, SAS, R, STATA, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, MicroStrategy, and SQL). Other important assets are strong written and oral communications skills, attention to detail, and knowledge about how institutions of higher education operate. Several American universities offer graduate certificate programs in institutional research, including Ball State University, Florida State University, Humboldt State University, North Dakota State University, Penn State University, Indiana University, University of Missouri, University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin - Stout , and the University of California San Diego Extension. \n\n"}

It is set in the same universe as \"The Book of the New Sun\" series that Wolfe inaugurated in 1980, and the Internet Science Fiction Database catalogs them both as sub-series of the \"Solar Cycle\", along with other writings.\n\nThe \"Long Sun\" story is continued in \"The Book of the Short Sun\" (1999–2001), a series of three novels or one in three volumes. In \"Short Sun\" the relation to the original \"New Sun\" is made clear.\n\nThe Mythopoeic Society considered \"The Book of the Sun\" as a whole for annual literary awards. It was one of five finalists for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award in 1997.\n\"Locus\" magazine and the American SF writers considered the volumes separately for \"Best Novel\" awards.\n\nA young priest Patera Silk tries to save his \"manteion\" (neighborhood church and school) from destruction by a ruthless crime lord. As he learns more about his world, a vast generation ship called the Whorl, he learns to distrust the gods he has worshiped and to revere the supposedly minor god known as The Outsider who has enlightened him.\n\nThe working title for the series was \"Starcrosser's Landfall\", and dust jacket mockups of the first volume were printed with that title. In the defense at the end of the final volume, the author refers to it alternately as \"The Book of the Long Sun\", \"Starcrosser's Landfall\", and \"The Book of Silk\".\n\nIn the event, \"The Book of the Long Sun\" was published in four volumes, almost simultaneously in the U.S. (Tor Books imprint, Tom Doherty Associates) and U.K. (New English Library imprint, Hodder & Stoughton). The Tor hardcover editions (see table) were almost 1500 pages long in sum.\n\nIn the U.S., both the first two books when available in 1994 and the last two in 1997 were bound together by a science fiction book club (\"GuildAmerica Books / SFBC\" in ISFDB). There is a two-volume trade paperback edition of the whole since November 2000 (Orb Books imprint, Tom Doherty). The Orb editions run 543 and 718 pages and ISFDB lists no single-volume edition.\n\nThe names of people from Silk's home city of Viron follow rigid conventions. Male humans are named after an animal or animal product: 'Blood,' 'Musk,' 'Quetzal,' etc. Female humans are named after a plant or plant product: 'Chenille,' 'Orchid,' 'Hyacinth,' etc. Androids (known in the book as \"chems\") are named for inanimate minerals and rocks: 'Marble,' 'Sand,' 'Schist,' etc.\n\nPatera Silk begins the tetralogy as the 23-year-old Augur of the Sun Street Manteion, arguably the poorest manteion in Viron. Augurs, in the religion of Silk's city, Viron, sacrifice animals to the gods, and examine the entrails of these sacrifices to seek knowledge about the future of the person who has provided the sacrifice, and the future of the augur. He believes himself to be \"enlightened\" by a minor deity known as the Outsider, who charges Silk to save his manteion, which has been sold to the crime lord Blood for tax reasons. His quest to save the manteion starts him on a journey into Viron's underworld. In the first book in the tetralogy, \"Nightside the Long Sun\", Silk begins to question his own moral fiber as he engages in various \"immoral\" acts for the sake of this quest.\n\nHis theophanies continue, and Patera Silk eventually develops a large following because of his continued contact with the gods of Viron. He becomes a popular hero, and with the help of a spy named Doctor Crane, he is elevated to the political position of Caldé, the high administrator of Viron. It is later discovered that Patera Silk is the rightful heir to this position, having been secretly named successor by the previous Caldé, Tussah (Silk's adoptive father), before he was assassinated by the oligarchical councilors of the Ayuntamiento, another governing body of Viron.\n\nSilk eventually marries the ex-prostitute Hyacinth and journeys with Auk to the city Mainframe, where the whorl's main computer is housed. During this trip he goes through a brief suicidal crisis, and comes to final conclusions about the moral doubts that he possessed during the earlier parts of the series.\n\nWhen \"The Book of the Long Sun\" concludes, Patera Silk's fate is unknown.\n\nSilk is an allegorical character, as is typical for Wolfe's work. He is often associated with Moses.\n\nMaytera Marble is a chemical citizen of Viron, or a \"chem.\" This means that she is a robot who possesses a self-aware, sentient mind. Maytera Marble was initially designed to be a maid, but as her life progressed she found a more religious calling and became one of the Sibyls at Patera Silk's Sun Street Manteion. Being over three hundred years old, certain body parts of hers have been replaced and others have worn away. At the beginning of the tetralogy, her functions have so decayed that she can no longer remember her precise age. Marble is Silk's main confidante at the manteion, Maytera Rose being too harsh for him and Maytera Mint initially too shy.\n\nLater in the series she reclaims several prosthetic parts from the dead Sibyl Maytera Rose, which causes her to obtain some of Rose's memories, resulting in an identity crisis of sorts.\n\nMaytera Marble eventually claims that her real name is Molybdenum, with the short nickname Moly, so that she can marry the soldier Hammerstone and begin constructing a daughter. Evidently she was originally a maid at the manteion and the death of a sibyl necessitated that she take vows. Patera Quetzal releases her from her service so that she can be wed to Corporal Hammerstone. However, as predicted by Silk, she later reveals that her name is in fact Maggie, or Magnesia, and she lied about being Moly so that Hammerstone would marry her.\n\nMaytera Mint is one of the sibyls of the Sun Street manteion. Initially rather shy, her concern starts the relationship between Patera Silk and the sneak-thief Auk. She is eventually inhabited by a piece of the deity Kypris, goddess of love. Kypris does not completely possess Maytera Mint, and the incomplete personality transfer gives Maytera Mint a newfound assertiveness.\n\nAt the funeral sacrifice for Maytera Rose, Maytera Mint presides over the sacrifices because Patera Silk has not yet returned from being captured by the Ayuntamiento. There is a theophany, during which the queen goddess Echidna appears and proclaims Mint to be her \"sword\" in the revolution against the Ayuntamiento. Leading a band of dissatisfied citizens, she becomes General Mint in Silk's army, facing off against the City Guard and eventually Viron's force of chem \"soldiers.\"\n\nAuk is introduced as a friend of Maytera Mint's from the manteion who needs spiritual guidance. When Silk speaks with him, he discovers that Auk is a criminal and involved with the prostitute Chenille. Auk counsels Silk on how to break into Blood's mansion. Later, Auk travels in the tunnels under Viron with Chenille, seeking Silk, and suffers a wound to the head. The god Tartaros enters Auk's mind and fixes the damage to his brain, making Auk a prophet of Tartaros in the process. Tartaros guides Auk out of the tunnels and eventually instructs him in guiding people to leave the whorl. When Patera Silk and his retinue travel to Mainframe, the home of the gods, Auk takes a landing craft that heads away from the \"Whorl\".\n\n\n"}

In-print versions are published by Collins in Britain and by HarperTeen in the United States, both divisions of HarperCollins. Firebird, an imprint of Penguin Group, released a new paperback edition on 12 April 2012.\n\n\"Fire and Hemlock\" was a Phoenix Award Honor Book in 2005.\n\nAs she clears out her old bedroom, Polly discovers that below her memories, in which she led an entirely normal and unremarkable life, there is a second set of memories, which are rather unusual.\n\nAs Polly thinks back to this \"second set\" of memories, the point where they seem to diverge is when she stumbled into a funeral in an old mansion, Hunsdon House, when she was ten and playing with her best friend, Nina. There, she was approached by a man named Thomas Lynn who took her back outside and kept her company. He takes her back inside to help him select six pictures from a large pile, his share of the estate of the deceased; one of them is a photograph called \"Fire and Hemlock\" (hence the name of the novel), which he gave to her. He then takes her back to her grandmother's house, where she is living.\n\nOver the following years Tom and Polly continue a friendship largely through correspondence, with occasional visits. Tom sends her books and letters with stories in them, many of which tie into the general theme of his predicament. Together, the two come up with stories about a hero named Tan Coul and his assistant Hero, who are Mr. Lynn's and Polly's alter egos, respectively. These stories all eventually come true, after a fashion. For instance, after discussing Tan Coul's horse, they encounter an identical horse disrupting traffic in the streets of London, having escaped from a nearby circus. An invented town and hardware store later turn out to be real, the proprietor being the spitting image of Tom, and \"his\" nephew Leslie falling into the story much later as a possible victim of Laurel's. Tom and Polly's story features three other heroes; later on, Tom gives Polly a photograph of all the members of his orchestra, and asks her to identify them. She immediately finds the other three heroes. These three are exactly the ones with whom Tom was considering setting up an independent string quartet.\n\nAll the while, Polly encounters members of Tom's ex-wife's family, all of whom seem to be threatening her and trying to break off her relationship with Tom. These include Seb, who is a few years older than Polly. Polly understands the threats as Laurel (Tom's ex-wife) having some sort of power over him. Tom refuses to talk about it.\n\nThis friendship develops against the background of Polly's growing up in her own disintegrating family life: her father Reg leaves, and a new lodger moves in and begins a relationship with her mother, Ivy. When Ivy sends her to live with her father in Bristol, it soon becomes apparent that she was not wanted there, her father having neither told his girlfriend that she was coming nor that she was supposed to live with them permanently. Eventually Polly moves in with her grandmother, who acts as a strong, fierce, strict anchor in her life.\n\nAs Polly turns sixteen, she realises that she has always loved Tom, but when she is rejected by him (in part because of their age difference, but also for her own safety, as she later discovers) she sets out to discover the secret of his relationship with the sinister Laurel that is somehow connected to all the supernatural events that happen to Tom and her. To do this, she performs voodoo-like ceremony, and it partly succeeds – she is summoned to Hunsdon House, where it all started. Laurel is there, but humiliates Polly and tells her (untruthfully) that Tom is dying of cancer, and wants to be left alone by her. Mortified, Polly agrees to forget him, and leaves. Her second set of memories ends here.\n\nThree years later, sitting in front of the picture (that she now realizes was a gift from Tom) Polly decides to start investigating, and finds out that all memory of Tom has been erased from her life, and that he has been eradicated from the memories of anyone who should have known him. As well as this, other people that she met in connection with Tom have no idea who she is, her friend Nina believes that Polly stopped talking to her years ago, and friends that she met through Tom have apparently never met her. She becomes frustrated, and is determined to find Tom, the man she knew and still loves.\n\nIn this she is aided by reading two ballads, Tam Lin and Thomas the Rhymer, which help her figure out the truth. In reality, Tom has entered into a deal with the so-called Queen of the Fairies – Laurel. The time has now come when he must give his life to prolong that of her husband, the sinister Morton Leroy, the King of the Fairies.\n\nUsing the information in the ballads as an instruction, she arrives at the ceremony over which Laurel is presiding, and manages to outwit her and secure Tom's life, and, depending on the way you interpret the strange happenings of the ending, his love.\n\n\nFeminism – The original story of Tam Lin is one of a resourceful and brave young girl named Janet who rescues her lover from the faeries. When Jones was writing this novel, she knew that she needed \"a narrative structure which did not simply put a female in a male's place\". However, through most of the book Polly is a tomboy. In the stories she and Tom tell, she casts herself in the role of \"Hero\", Tom Lynn's girl assistant, who must disguise herself as a boy.\n\nThis story explicitly mirrors the folktale of Tam Lin, which existed since at least the mid-sixteenth century. Diana Wynne Jones wrote that her goal was \"to write a book in which modern life and heroic mythical events approached one another so closely that they were nearly impossible to separate.\" The funeral building represents Carterhaugh. Tom Lynn is Tam Lin, who is being used as a tithe to Hell. His ex-wife Laurel represents the Queen of the Faeries. Polly directly identifies herself with Janet, after reading the \"Oxford Book of Ballads\", and thinks she \"can only hope she might manage to do what Janet had done\".\n\nThe overall structure of the book is modeled after T.S. Eliot's \"Four Quartets\", which in Jones' words \"combines static meditation with movement in an extraordinary way, to become a quest of the mind away from the Nothing of spiritual death (Hemlock), towards the Fire which is imagination and redemption – the Nowhere.\"\n\nAs Polly grows up, Tom Lynn sends her books, many of which are intended to inform her indirectly of his pact with Laurel. He says at one point, regarding a book of fairy stories, \"Only thin, weak thinkers despise fairy stories. Each one has a true, strange fact in it, you know, which you can find if you look.\".\n\nThese include \"The Golden Bough\", \"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\", and \"The Oxford Book of Ballads\" (which contains both \"Thomas the Rhymer\" and \"Tam Lin\").\n\nAfter reading \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas, Polly refers to herself as Porthos (her favourite character) in the clandestine letters she mails to Tom. Later in the book, Tom and his friends form a string quartet under the name of The Dumas Quartet, and assigns aliases to each member; Tom is Athos.\n\nPolly reads \"The Lord of the Rings\" and writes a long story in which her alter ego Hero bravely destroys a dangerous ring. She posts it to Tom and is crushed when he tersely writes back \"Use your own ideas.\"\n\nThere are many other passing references to other works of literature, art, and music found throughout the book.\n\nThere are 12 books that Polly receives for Christmas. Tom Lynn includes a note with them saying that the bookstore he bought them from said that they are books that no one should grow up without reading. Of these 12, only 7 are named.\n\nThere are 5 paintings and a photo that Lynn receives at the funeral. All of them are described as quite valuable.\nOne other painting that is worth mentioning is John Pettie's \"The Vigil\". Mr. Lynn calls it \"soppy\" when Polly shows it to him.\n\n\n\n"}

It was created by Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson of the Medill–McCormick–Patterson family (long-time owners of the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"New York Daily News\" and founding later \"Newsday\" on New York's Long Island) when she bought \"The Washington Times\" and \"The Washington Herald\" from the syndicate newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst (1863–1951), and merged them. The result was a \"24-hour\" newspaper, with 10 editions per day, from morning to evening.\n\nIn 1917, Hearst acquired the old \"Washington Times\". It had been established in 1894 and owned successively by Congressman Charles G. Conn (1844–1931) of Elkhart, Indiana, publisher Stilson Hutchins (1838–1912, previous founder/owner of \"The Washington Post\", 1877–1889), and most recently Frank A. Munsey (1854–1925), a financier, banker and magazine publisher known as the \"Dealer in Dailies\" and the \"Undertaker of Journalism\" for his extensive newspaper syndicate. Five years later, he bought the \"Herald\", which had been founded in 1906.\n\nCissy Patterson, first cousin of \"Tribune\" publisher Robert McCormick and younger sister of \"Daily News\" publisher Joseph Medill Patterson, was editor of both papers from 1930 on, and leased them from Hearst in 1937. She was eager to buy them outright, and was able to do so in 1939 at the confluence of Hearst's near-bankruptcy caused by the increasing costs of his Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California, and the purchase attempts by the rival \"Washington Post\" family of Eugene Meyer (1879–1959) and Phillip L. Graham (1915–1963), who had bought the then bankrupt \"Post\" at auction in 1933. Patterson merged the papers into the \"Times-Herald\", which she ran until her death in 1948. \n\nMcCormick had purchased the newspaper following Cissy Patterson’s 1948 death. The paper became an \"isolationist and archconservative\" publication known for sensationalism. McCormick appointed his niece, Ruth \"Bazy\" McCormick Miller as the publisher of the paper in 1949. He wanted Miller to use the paper to create \"an outpost of American principles\". When the two came to a parting of the ways over her relationship with one of the paper's editors, Garvin Tankersley, as well as editorial control over the paper, he ordered her to choose between Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she eloped with Tankersley and resigned from the \"Times-Herald\". She later said, \"I understood when I went to the \"Times-Herald\" I was to have full control.

When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Miller, by then Bazy Tankersley, be given a chance to purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. In March 1954, the \"Times-Herald\" was purchased by Graham, owner of the \"Post\". For a time, the combined paper was officially known as \"The Washington Post and Times-Herald\", but the \"Post\" consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. The \"Times-Herald\" portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent on a second line in ensuing years and was dropped entirely in 1973.\n\n\n"}

He was the founding first Executive Director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\n\nJack Landau was born to Jacob and Florence Landau (formerly Florence Binaghi). He spent his elementary school years in Englewood, New Jersey, but the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, when he was 12 years old. Landau attended New Rochelle High School, where he was a varsity swimmer and voted \"most talkative boy.\" He then attended Harvard College, where he majored in history. After graduating from Harvard, Landau lived briefly in San Francisco, working retail jobs and trying to write fiction.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Reporters Committee, Landau worked as a journalist for several national news organizations including the Bergen Record, Associated Press and \"The Washington Post\". His stories covered numerous topics, but his specialty was reporting on the American courts. Landau was a Harvard College graduate and legally trained reporter in an era when this was an oddity, having received a law degree from New York University. His reports of inequities in the American military justice system are credited with having prompted the reform of that system into its current modern shape. He also covered the Cuban Revolution for the Associated Press, stationed in Havana (Landau spoke conversational Spanish).\n\nLandau also served as the press secretary to United States Attorney General John Mitchell. John Mitchell served as Attorney General under President Richard Nixon. As the spokesman for Mitchell, Landau addressed the public concerning many of the difficult legal issues facing the U.S. Government during the late 1960s. During one incident, he addressed a hostile and abusive crowd of activists opposed to the Vietnam War who were demanding an audience with the Attorney General during a large-scale protest. Their leader was American beat poet Allen Ginsberg, who purportedly dismissed Landau as a tool of the establishment.\n\nIronically, it was Landau’s organization, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that would rock the establishment by preventing Richard Nixon from destroying his records in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Under Landau’s leadership, the Reporters Committee would become America’s foremost activist organization in furtherance of the rights of journalists and reporters. This work won Landau numerous awards and accolades. He had a falling-out with the Reporters Committee during the late 1980s, after which he left to write a popular column in the Newhouse News syndicate of daily newspapers.\n\nLandau was retired at the time of his death. He was divorced and had two children with former spouse, attorney Brooksley E. Born.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2138622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138622", "title": "Molybdenum hexacarbonyl", "text": "Molybdenum hexacarbonyl\n\nMolybdenum hexacarbonyl (also called molybdenum carbonyl) is the chemical compound with the formula Mo(CO). This colorless solid, like its chromium and tungsten analogues, is noteworthy as a volatile, air-stable derivative of a metal in its zero oxidation state.\n\nMo(CO) adopts an octahedral geometry consisting of six rod-like CO ligands radiating from the central Mo atom. A recurring minor debate in some chemical circles concerns the definition of an \"organometallic\" compound. Usually, organometallic indicates the presence of a metal directly bonded via a M–C bond to an organic fragment, which must in turn have a C–H bond. By this strict definition, Mo(CO) is not organometallic.\n\nMo(CO) is prepared by the reduction of molybdenum chlorides or oxides under a pressure of carbon monoxide, although it would be unusual to prepare this inexpensive compound in the laboratory. The compound is somewhat air-stable and sparingly soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.\n\nMo(CO) has been detected in landfills and sewage plants, the reducing, anaerobic environment being conducive to formation of Mo(CO).\n\nMo(CO) is a popular reagent in organometallic synthesis because one or more CO ligands can be displaced by other donor ligands. Mo(CO), [Mo(CO)(MeCN)], and related derivatives are employed as catalysts in organic synthesis for example, alkyne metathesis and the Pauson–Khand reaction.\n\nMo(CO) reacts with 2,2′-bipyridine to afford Mo(CO)(bipy). UV-photolysis of a THF solution of Mo(CO) gives Mo(CO)(THF). \n\nThe thermal reaction of Mo(CO) with piperidine affords Mo(CO)(piperidine). The two piperidine ligands in this yellow-colored compound are labile, which allows other ligands to be introduced under mild conditions. For instance, the reaction of [Mo(CO)(piperidine)] with triphenyl phosphine in boiling dichloromethane (b.p. ca. 40 °C) gives \"cis\"-[Mo(CO)(PPh)]. This \"cis-\" complex isomerizes in toluene to \"trans\"-[Mo(CO)(PPh)].\n\nMo(CO) also can be converted to its tris(acetonitrile) derivative. The compound serves as a source of \"Mo(CO)\". For instance treatment with allyl chloride gives [MoCl(allyl)(CO)(MeCN)], whereas treatment with KTp and sodium cyclopentadienide gives [MoTp(CO)] and [MoCp(CO)] anions, respectively. These anions react with a variety of electrophiles. A related source of Mo(CO) is cycloheptatrienemolybdenum tricarbonyl.\n\nMolybdenum hexacarbonyl is widely used in electron beam-induced deposition technique - it is easily vaporized and decomposed by the electron beam providing a convenient source of molybdenum atoms. \n\nLike all metal carbonyls, Mo(CO) is dangerous source of volatile metal as well as CO. \n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1977 to 1985, and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller. His father, Goldwin Elgie, was also a Conservative Ontario MPP in the 1930s and 1940s. He was a member of the Ontario Press Council from 2001, serving as chair from 2006 until his death.\n\nRobert Elgie was born in Toronto, Ontario. He received his B.A. from the University of Western Ontario in 1950, his LL.B. from Osgoode Hall Law School and his medical degree from the University of Ottawa. He trained as both a lawyer and neurosurgeon, and worked in the medical field. Elgie taught at the medical schools of Queen's University and the University of Toronto and was chief of medical staff at Scarborough General Hospital.\n\nElgie was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1977 provincial election, winning an easy victory in the Toronto-area seat of York East. After a brief period in the government backbenches, he was appointed to Bill Davis's cabinet on August 18, 1978 as Minister of Labour. A Red Tory by ideology, Elgie was easily the most left-wing figure in the Davis cabinet. He was supported by the province's unions, and passed amendments to Ontario's Human Rights Code and Occupational Health and Safety regulations which were favourable to labour interests. Some campus Progressive Conservative groups opposed his efforts to grant human rights officers the right to investigate and arbitrate reports of workplace discrimination.\n\nElgie was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, and was named Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations on February 13, 1982. He supported Roy McMurtry's bid to succeed Davis as party leader in 1985. When Frank Miller replaced Davis as Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he named Elgie as his Minister of Community and Social Services. He was re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1985 election, as the Progressive Conservatives won a narrow minority government under Miller's leadership. Elgie was again appointed as Minister of Labour on May 17, 1985.\n\nFollowing the election, Elgie favoured an alliance with the New Democratic Party to keep the Progressive Conservatives in power. These plans came to nothing, and the opposition Liberal Party was able to form a minority government with NDP support on June 26, 1985. Elgie had little interest in serving on the opposition benches, and soon accepted an appointment by new Liberal Premier David Peterson as chair of the Workers' Compensation Board of Ontario. He formally resigned from the legislature on September 26, 1985, and served as chair of the Ontario Worker's Compensation Board until 1991.\n\nAfter leaving the WCB, he moved to Nova Scotia, and served as the founder first director of Dalhousie University's Health Law Institute from 1991 until 1996. He was appointed part-time chair of Nova Scotia's Workers' Compensation Board in the same period, and is credited with making significant improvements to this board's activities. Returning to Ontario, Elgie then served as chair of the \"Patent Medicine Prices Review Board\" from 1995 to 2005, and was appointed chair of the Ontario Greenbelt Council by the provincial Minister of Municipal Affairs in the summer of 2005 with a salary of $1 a year. On Jan. 1, 2006, he became the 6th Chair of the Ontario Press Council, of which he had been a member since 2001. He served as chair until his death in 2013. In his later life he lived in the town of Georgina, Ontario in York Region.\n\nDespite serving and supporting the Tories for much of his life, Elgie's left leaning ideologies led him away from the conservative party later in his life. During the Mike Harris government of the 1990s, Elgie complained that the Ontario Progressive Conservatives had become too right-wing.\n\nElgie was named to the Order of Canada in 2003. He died on April 4, 2013 from congestive heart failure.\n\nBob Elgie married his wife Nancy in 1956, and she became an integral part of his life and career. Nancy, a psychologist by trade, served as a school trustee (and vice chair 2011-13 and 2015) in the York Region District School Board. She stepped down in 2017 after becoming embroiled in a prolonged racial controversy. Together they raised 5 children, and despite his many careers, Bob always did his best to make time for his family. Elgie helped create a loving home and taught his children that those who are born into affluence are expected to give back to society. His eldest daughter, Allyson, is a psychologist who runs a provincial assessment and research centre, The Regional Assessment and Resource Centre, which provides supports to post-secondary students with disabilities. His eldest son, Stewart, is an environmental advocacy lawyer, founder of the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, and a professor at the University of Ottawa. In 2007 Stewart founded Sustainable Prosperity, an environmental research and policy initiative. His second son, William (\"Bill\"), is the Director of the Upper Canada College Norval Outdoor School and a leader in the Outdoor Education community. Their youngest son, Peter, is a teacher and has run for the Green Party of Canada and has been deputy leader of the Green Party of Ontario. His youngest daughter, Catherine, is a nurse. Between his 5 children, Robert Elgie was also grandfather to 13 grandchildren.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nTagalog is the main language spoken in Calintaan, being spoken by approximately 62% of the household population, followed by Ilocano which is spoken by about 22%.\n\nCalintaan has a total land area of . It is covered in vast rice paddies and coryphas, which are used for making buri. The land area is around 82% mountainous with the rest of it being mostly coastal plains and hills.\n\nCalintaan is politically subdivided into 7 barangays.\n\n\nIlilin is the first village mentioned in the history of Calintaan; this village is now believed to be Barangay Iriron based on its location in the old maps. Records left by the Jesuits in 1666 mentioned that adults 20 to 24 years old were baptized in Ililin. The village is recorded as belonging to the Parish of Mangarin in 1733.\n\nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 23, 1739, 100 Moro pirates aboard five bancas laid siege to the village. Most of the residents escaped, but a few villagers and a visiting missionary were captured by the pirates and brought to Jolo. Word reached the Order of Augustinian Recollects in 1740 that the missionary, Fr. Leon de San Jose, has been killed.\n\nIn 1754, pirates again attacked Ililin, but the people beat the pirates into retreat. The pirates instead attacked Dongon, a neighboring village. Later records reveal that Ililin was eventually destroyed by the Moros. The residents migrated to plains and mountains further from the coast. In 1819, by which time Ililin was being called Iriron, a new parish was created with a population of 1,300 persons. Pirate attacks continued to plague the region, and residents continued to leave until, by 1829, the population had dwindled to 150. Only a few buildings were left, among them the church, a convent and the prison.\n\nBy 1871, Spain had managed to control the problem of piracy throughout the Philippines, and the villages of Mindoro repopulated. In the area called Magarang a cattle ranch was set up by a Spaniard named Pascual Ledesma. This ranch was purchased by the Augustinian Recollects in 1894. The Order brought in a new administrator, Espiridion Jiminez, who would become \"capital del pueblo\" when the ranch became a pueblo in 1896.\n\nAfter some disagreement with the friars, Capitan Jimenez relocated his family and followers—including the families Pascual, Labrador, Pudan, Romaquin, Picarzo and Isidro-to found a new community, in a place they called Calintaan after the word for the leeches which they encountered there.\n\nDuring the revolution against the Spanish authorities, Capt. Jimenez, Isidro Zamora, Pedro Dapil and Marcelino Vitang were among the leaders of the local rebellion. They joined forces with Captain Pedro Fernandez' revolutionaries from Sablayan. Also in Fernandez' group were Vicente Gallembas, Tiago Dangeros, Carpo Urieta, Docoy Eniega, Vicente Dangcoding, Tiago Dantayana and Paeng Dawatis. With the approval of other revolutionary leaders, including the leaders of West Mindoro and Calapan, Jiminez and Fernandez combined their groups to march on El Pueblo de Magarang in 1897, where the 75-man company captured the Spaniards and missionary friars.\n\nAntoon Postma, a Dutch researcher, indicated that the captured men were held for a time at Magarang before being sent, by way of Paluan, to Taysan, Batangas. The captives were held for several years before the Americans occupied Mindoro and freed them in 1904.\n\nAfter the end of the Spanish regime, Calintaan became progressive, with Eligio Jimenez serving as the first appointed \"cabeza de barangay\". Sablayan became a municipality during the American period, holding jurisdiction over barrios including Iriron and Calintaan. The municipal board of Sablayan was dominated by representatives from Calintaan. Some of these representatives were Leoncio Panganiban, Benigno Lontoc, Juanito Gonzales, Juan Credo, Pedro Credo, Agustin Esmelo, Francisco Esmelo, Eriberto Lineses, Atanacio Encomio,Pedro Romaquin, Constancio Villarosa, Cornelio Gasmin, Aniceto Apigo, Alberto Obispo, Amador Ulay and Vicente Isidro. Calintaan saw its first primary school open in 1914. During this period, the residents of Calintaan requested that they be established as a municipality themselves rather than sitting as a barrio of Sablayan. They felt that Sablayan was too far away for easy governance. The petition was heard in Calapan, which at that time served as Provincial Council of all of Mindoro. Although some from the Sablayan municipal council supported the petitioners, their request was ultimately declined because it was feared that Calintaan did not have enough income to maintain a municipal government.\n\nIn 1940, a resident of Calintaan, Pedro Gonzales, became mayor by a wide margin of Sablayan, becoming the first from Calintaan to do so.\n\nLess than a year after Gonzales' election, World War II caused most of the residents of Calintaan to evacuate, including the mayor himself. Calintaan was occupied by the Japanese in April 1942, at which point all evacuated houses were burned. Men who had remained during the evacuations were forced to work in San Jose at a military camp. On December 15, 1944, the island was liberated by Allied Forces, led by U.S. Brigadier General William Dunckel. From that point until May 1943, the American forces used the area of Sitio Bulangcog, Barrio Iriron, for a radar station with which they could monitor enemy warplanes.\n\nOccidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro were formalized as provinces after the war on November 15, 1950. The population of Mindoro boomed as residents arrived from elsewhere, and the forests were cut from surrounding areas. Communal irrigation systems were built for ricefields. The indigenous Tau-Buhid or Batangan tribe relocated to the mountains. Calintaan itself became a municipality distinct from Sablayan on June 18, 1966, with governance of an area of 38,250 hectares, including the barrios of Concepcion, Iriron, New Dagupan and Tanyag. In response to public demand, a high school was also opened in 1966, located in Poblacion, Calintaan. Calintaan's first municipal mayor was Felomino Jiminez, elected on November 14, 1967.\n\nIn 1970, the barrio high school became a municipal high school, with extension classes opening at Tanyag, Iriron and Concepcion. At this time, the population of the Calintaan jurisdiction was 7,949. Due to continued immigration, the additional barrios of Poypoy and Malpalon were added to Calintaan. Home of the indigenous population, these have subsequently become Barangays. National parks were established in Poypoy, Calintaan and Sablayan to protect endangered species, including Mindoro's unique wild animals, the tamaraw. National agencies stepped in for other work as well, including improving irrigation.\n\nIn 1971, during the first year of service of Calintaan Mayor Amador Sison, the Philippines entered a state of martial law. The national government then saw to additional improvements in Calintaan, including enlarging the canals so as to provide better irrigation and building roads and bridges. After Sison's death in April 1977, the office was inhabited by Vice Mayor Romeo Calabio, who in three years of service oversaw the addition of a health center and the initiation of a central town water system, before the next election on January 30, 1980. Following that election, Felomino Jimenez returned as municipal mayor to continue civic improvements.\n\nImportant to the region, an Apostolic Vicariate of San Jose in Mindoro was created at St. Joseph Cathedral, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro. On July 1, 1983, Bishop Vicente Manuel, a grandson of Espiridion Jimenez, became its first Vicar Apostolic. Bishop Manuel was active in overseeing the implementation of programs in Calintaan engineered to improve the lives of Catholic residents.\n\nFollowing Mayor Jimenez's death on August 30, 1985, Vice Mayor Apolinario Bullagay entered office.\n\nAll of the officials in Calintaan were, like the rest of local officials in the Philippines, replaced by President Corazon Aquino following the peaceful revolution at EDSA in 1986. Edgardo Gagtan was appointed as OIC-Mayor. He initiated the construction of the public market, school buildings and communal faucets in some barangays. The municipality of Calintaan endured turbulent times, as the New People’s Army (NPA) attacked it and its barrios as part of their campaign against the government. The Philippine government countered the revolutionaries by conducting seminars to promote its aims and granting amnesty and awarding land to those who chose to reform. After several years, rebel unrest in Calintaan quieted.\n\nThe area quickly went through several mayors following 1996 before Rolando Sison was elected in 1991, and civic construction continued. Meanwhile, the area's high school had continued to grow until, along with the barangay schools at Tanyag, Iriron and Concepcion, it became a national high school (CNHS) by executive order of Aquino. Sison's successor, attorney Eric Labrador (who had briefly served during those years of unrest) returned to office in 1995 and continued to oversee construction until the 1998 election of Renato Paulino. During Sison's term, the Apostolic Vicariate formed a farmers' cooperative and instructed area farmers in Integrated Pest Management (IPM).\n\nUnder Paulino's term as mayor, the area continued to expand, with new roads and public buildings, including a nursery and public market. He also oversaw the initiation of a gymnasium, which is not yet completed.\n\nA rebel group known as the New Peoples Army (NPA) is still a threat to the peace of Calintaan notwithstanding governmental efforts to sway leftist groups to democracy.\n\nIn 2007, Lily Racca Estoya became the mayor, with former Mayor Paulino, who had just completed his third term, as her running mate.\n\nThe economy of Calintaan is mainly agricultural, and its major crop is rice. Other crops produced and sold in Calintaan include corn, legumes, coconuts, and bananas. Practices such as fishing, livestock, poultry, banana processing (banana chips) and buricraft (the production of goods made from buri fibers such as buntal) are also important to the economy.\n\n"}

{"id": "2138635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138635", "title": "Washington and Old Dominion Railroad", "text": "Washington and Old Dominion Railroad\n\nThe Washington and Old Dominion Railroad (colloquially referred to as the W&OD), the successor to the bankrupt Washington and Old Dominion Railway, was an intrastate short-line railroad located in Northern Virginia. Its oldest line extended from Alexandria on the Potomac River northwest to Bluemont at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains near Snickers Gap, not far from the boundary line between Virginia and West Virginia. The railroad's route largely paralleled the routes of the Potomac River and the present Virginia State Route 7 (VA Route 7).\n\nThe line followed the winding course of Four Mile Run upstream from Alexandria through Arlington to Falls Church. At that point, the railroad was above the Fall Line and was able to follow a more direct northwesterly course in Virginia through Dunn Loring, Vienna, Sunset Hills (now in Reston), Herndon, Sterling, Ashburn, Leesburg, Paeonian Springs, Hamilton, Purcellville and Round Hill to its terminus at Bluemont, turning sharply to the west only after passing through Clarke's Gap in Catoctin Mountain west of Leesburg. A branch connected the line to Rosslyn. The Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail (W&OD Trail), the Bluemont Junction Trail, the Mount Jefferson Park and Greenway Trail, several other trails, Interstate 66 (I-66), and Old Dominion Drive (Virginia State Route 309) have replaced much of the railroad's route.\n\nOriginally incorporated as the Alexandria and Harper's Ferry Railroad, construction on the line began in 1855 by the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire (AL&H) Railroad under the presidency of Lewis McKenzie. First intended to cross the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah River to reach the coal fields in the western part of Hampshire County, Virginia, that are now within Mineral County, West Virginia, the AL&H began operating to Vienna in 1859 from a terminal near Princess and Fairfax Streets in old town Alexandria. In 1860, the AL&H reached Leesburg in Loudoun County, with plans to extend the line through Hillsborough, Vestal's Gap, Berryville and Winchester.\n\nBecause of its proximity to Washington, D.C., the line saw much use and disruption during the Civil War. After the war, the name of the line was changed in 1870 to the Washington and Ohio Railroad. After changing its planned route to enable it to cross the Blue Ridge through Snickers Gap rather than through the more northerly Vestal's Gap, the railroad extended its line from Leesburg to Hamilton in 1870 and to Round Hill in 1874.\n\nUpon acquisition by new owners in the 1880s, the line's name was changed twice: first to the Washington and Western Railroad in 1882 and in the next year to the Washington, Ohio and Western (WO&W) Railroad. However, the line did not serve Washington, Ohio, or the West.\n\nIn 1886, the Richmond and Danville Railroad, whose trunk line travelled between Washington, D.C., and Atlanta with connections to New York City, New Orleans, Mississippi and Florida, leased the WO&W. The Richmond and Danville also acquired a branch that paralleled the WO&W while traveling between Manassas and Strasburg, Virginia, where it connected to railroads in the Shenandoah Valley west of the Blue Ridge that the WO&W did not reach (see: Manassas Gap Railroad). In 1888, the Richmond and Danville began to operate the WO&W's trains between Washington, D.C., and Round Hill.\n\nIn 1894, the newly formed Southern Railway absorbed the Richmond and Danville Railroad and acquired the WO&W. In 1900, the Southern Railway extended the line westward for four miles from Round Hill to Bluemont (formerly Snickersville). The Southern Railway designated the line as its Bluemont Branch.\n\nBy 1908, steam locomotives were hauling Southern Railway passenger trains from the new Union Station in Washington, D.C., to Alexandria Junction (north of old town Alexandria), where they switched to travel westward on the Bluemont Branch. Connecting trains shuttled passengers between Alexandria Junction and the former AL&H terminal in old town Alexandria. On weekends, express trains carried vacationers from Washington to Bluemont and other towns in western Loudoun County in which resorts had developed.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1906, electric trolleys had begun to run on the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad (GF&OD) northwest to Great Falls from Georgetown in Washington, D.C. This line, which John Roll McLean and Stephen Benton Elkins owned at the time, crossed the Potomac River on the old Aqueduct Bridge, passed through Rosslyn, and traveled northwest on a double-tracked line through Arlington and Fairfax County to an amusement park (trolley park) that the railroad company constructed and operated near the falls.\n\nIn 1911, McLean and Elkins formed a new corporation, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway. In that year, they concluded negotiations with the Southern Railway to lease the Southern's Bluemont Branch and to take over all service on the branch on July 1, 1912. The lease excluded the portion of the Southern's route that connected Potomac Yard with the former AL&H terminal in old town Alexandria.\n\nIn 1912, the GF&OD became the \"Great Falls Division\" of the W&OD Railway, while the Southern's Bluemont Branch became a part of the W&OD Railway's \"Bluemont Division\". The W&OD electrified all of its operations over the next four years, becoming an interurban electric trolley system that carried passengers, mail, milk and freight. From that time onward, W&OD trains crossed over Potomac Yard on a long trestle constructed earlier for the Southern Railway. In contrast to the Southern Railway's earlier Bluemont Branch service, the W&OD Railway's Bluemont Division did not serve Washington's Union Station.\n\nTo join its two lines, the W&OD Railway constructed in 1912 a double-tracked Bluemont Division connecting line that traveled between two new junctions in Arlington: Bluemont Junction on the Alexandria-Bluemont line and Thrifton Junction on the Georgetown-Great Falls line. The connecting line passed through Lacey (near the west end of Ballston), crossing on a through girder bridge over a competing interurban electric trolley line, the Fairfax line of the Washington-Virginia Railway (see Northern Virginia trolleys). The rival line carried passengers between Rosslyn, Clarendon, Ballston, Falls Church, Vienna and Fairfax City.\n\nThe railway's electrification system distributed 650 volts direct current (DC) to its Bluemont Division cars and trains through overhead catenary lines. Single overhead lines carried the Great Falls Division's electricity over its tracks. Stationary and movable electrical substations containing Westinghouse alternating current (AC) to DC converters were located at various points along the railway's routes.\n\nThe W&OD's main passenger line ran from Georgetown and Rosslyn through Thrifton Junction, Bluemont Junction and westward to Bluemont. However, after crossing the Potomac River from Georgetown, many W&OD passengers transferred in Rosslyn to the trolleys of the competing Washington-Virginia Railway. Most of the W&OD's freight trains ran between Potomac Yard, Bluemont Junction and either Rosslyn or various locations along the Bluemont Division.\n\nIn 1923, the W&OD Railway ceased operating from Georgetown when the federal government replaced the aging Aqueduct Bridge with the new Francis Scott Key Bridge. At the same time, the railroad constructed a new passenger station in Rosslyn which became its \"Washington\" terminal.\n\nThe W&OD Railway fell upon hard times in the 1930s during the Great Depression. In 1932, the railway went into bankruptcy and was placed in receivership. The railway also discontinued passenger service between Bluemont Junction and Alexandria during 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the railway abandoned operations on the Great Falls Division between Thrifton Junction and Great Falls. The abandoned railway route then became Old Dominion Drive (Virginia State Route 309). In 1979, the old rail trestle of the Great Falls Division over Difficult Run was demolished after years of carrying automobile traffic on Old Dominion Drive.\n\nIn 1936, the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a new corporation that Davis Elkins (the son of Stephen Benton Elkins) had created, assumed operation of the remnants of the W&OD Railway, which consisted only of the Railway's Bluemont Division and the portion of the former Great Falls Division that had remained between Rosslyn and Thrifton (which was no longer a junction). Shortly thereafter, in 1939, the railroad abandoned the western end of its line, which had connected the towns of Purcellville and Bluemont.\n\nIn 1945, the W&OD Railroad acquired ownership of the section of line between Potomac Yard and Purcellville that the W&OD Railway had earlier leased from the Southern Railway. The Southern Railway retained ownership of the easternmost section of the railroad's route, which still connected Potomac Yard to the Southern's freight and passenger stations in old town Alexandria.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the W&OD Railroad converted all of its lines' operations from electric to diesel or gasoline power. The railroad discontinued its electrified passenger service in 1941, but temporarily resumed passenger service during World War II using gas—electric motor cars and cars pulled by diesel–electric locomotives. Passenger and mail service finally ended in 1951; thereafter, the railroad carried only freight. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) purchased the W&OD Railroad in 1956, but did not change the railroad's name.\n\nThe 1960s were a decade of decline and closure for the W&OD. The Virginia highway department began negotiations to purchase the Rosslyn spur in 1960 and was trying to buy the mainline as early as 1962 for the construction of a road that was to become Interstate 66 (I-66). In July 1962, the highway department bought the Rosslyn spur for $900,000. In September 1963, the railroad stopped operating to Rosslyn. The railroad removed its tracks between Lacey (south of Washington Boulevard) and Rosslyn by November 1964.\n\nIn February 1965, the Commonwealth of Virginia contracted to buy of the mainline from Herndon to Alexandria for $3.5 million. The C&O Railway then petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for permission to abandon the railroad's remnant. The purchase would eliminate the need to build a grade separation where the railroad crossed the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway, (now Interstate 395 (I-395)) at grade and at another grade separation for I-66. The purchase would also provide of right-of-way for I-66, saving the state $5 million.\n\nThe purchase was opposed by business interests in Loudoun County, the Arlington County Chamber of Commerce, various state, county and local officials, railway labor organizations and 21 of the 133 shippers who still used the freight service. The Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVCC), which was interested in converting the line to a commuter rail service, also opposed the purchase. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which at the time was planning to construct a rapid transit system for the Washington area, tried to postpone the abandonment in the hopes of using part of the right-of-way for transit.\n\nThe highway department simultaneously made plans to secretly sell all but of the route to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) (now Dominion Virginia Power), whose transmission lines had run along the railroad's right-of-way. As a result, the highway department would sell to VEPCO the remaining of right-of-way, including the north of Herndon. The sale would thus prevent the NVCC from buying the land for mass transit.\n\nIn August 1967, transit advocates led by Del. Clive L. DuVal II (Fairfax-Falls Church) and WMATA secured a 60-day postponement of the abandonment while they put together a plan to use the right-of-way for transit. However, according to WMATA general manager Jackson Graham, the estimated cost of using the full right-of-way for commuter rail was $70 million. Because WMATA did not expect the proposed transit line to be able to generate enough ridership to be cost-effective, WMATA rejected that option.\n\nOn November 10, 1967, WMATA announced that it had come to an agreement with the highway department that would give WMATA a two- year option to buy a stretch of the right of way from Glebe Road (Virginia Route 120) to the Capital Beltway (now Interstate 495 (I-495)), where I-66 was to be built, and to operate mass transit in the highway's median strip. WMATA would also have a 2-year option to buy the of right-of-way from the Beltway to Herndon for the use of commuter trains, an option that WMATA did not exercise. A last minute offer to buy the railroad at its salvage cost and keep it running that the railroad's customers made was rejected in 1967.\n\nIn 1968, the ICC decided to permit the C&O to abandon and sell its line. After initially planning to run their last train on January 30, 1968, a temporary restraining order kept the line open until August 27, 1968. On the last day, B&O switcher 9155 pulled two empty lumber cars to Potomac Yard from the Murphy and Ames Lumber Company siding in Falls Church. On August 30, the railroad shipped its three diesel locomotives to the B&O's Baltimore engine terminal, from which a salvage dealer purchased them. By 1969, the C&O had removed all of its tracks and ties, except for some tracks that were crossing paved roads. In 1974, the railroad's bridge over the Capital Beltway was demolished to enable the highway to be widened.\n\nThe Virginia highway department retained the section of the railroad's route that crossed the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway along the Arlington-Alexandria boundary and the portion of the route in Arlington immediately east of Falls Church, on which it built I–66. WMATA then constructed a part of Washington Metro's Orange Line within the median strip of I-66 on that portion of the railroad's former route.\n\nIn 1977, VEPCO agreed to sell to the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA) (now NOVA Parks) for $3.6 million the portion of its right-of-way that lay west of the Alexandria/Arlington boundary. The NVRPA then incorporated that portion of the right-of-way into its Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park, within which it constructed the W&OD Trail. NVRPA completed the trail to Purcellville in 1988.\n\nIn 1999, Virginia Department of Historic Resources staff determined that the \"Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Historic District\" was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A 2000 NRHP registration form states that the Historic District is eligible for the listing because the District \"is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history\". The form contains an in-depth description of the District's historical resources and of the railroad's history, as well as maps that show the locations of the Districts's major historical features.\n\nOn June 18, 1979, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service of the United States Department of the Interior added the Herndon depot to the NRHP. On May 28, 2010, the National Park Service added the Purcellville train station to the NRHP. The Virginia Department of Historic Resources has added both stations to the Virginia Landmarks Register.<br><br>\n\nMost of the Bluemont Division's passenger cars or trains ran on the W&OD Railway's Great Falls Division's line from Georgetown over the Aqueduct Bridge through Rosslyn to Thrifton Junction. From Thrifton Junction, the trains ran on the Bluemont Division's connecting line to Bluemont Junction, where they met other Bluemont Division passenger cars or trains that ran from Alexandria, following Four Mile Run in Arlington. Some of the Bluemont Division cars or trains then continued their trips through Falls Church, Vienna, Herndon, Sterling, Ashburn, Leesburg, Clarke's Gap and Purcellville to terminate in Bluemont, Virginia, at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, following a route that was similar to that of Virginia State Route 7.\n\nAfter the W&OD Railroad closed, the Southern Railway and its successor, the Norfolk Southern Railway, operated a spur between the Alexandria waterfront and a north-south route that traveled through Potomac Yard before the Yard closed in 1989. The spur formerly served trains traveling from the eastern end of the Bluemont Division to the Southern Railway's freight and passenger stations in old town Alexandria. As the Southern Railway owned and operated the spur and the stations, this section of track remained in operation after the W&OD closed. Railroad operations ended on the spur in 2012–2013 when GenOn Energy's Potomac River Generating Station and the Robinson Terminal's Oronoco Street warehouse closed.\n\nA paved trail in Alexandria's linear Mt. Jefferson Park has replaced part of the Bluemont Division's course through that city. NOVA Parks' -long W&OD Trail travels in the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park within the Bluemont Division's former right-of-way from the Alexandria/Arlington boundary through Bluemont Junction to Purcellville. The section of the Bluemont Division between Purcellville and Bluemont has not become a part of any trail, as the W&OD Railroad abandoned this section in 1938, thirty years before the remainder of its line closed.\n\nThe stations on the Alexandria-Bluemont line of the W&OD's Bluemont Division (with locations of sites in 2008) were:\n\nThe following remnants of the Alexandria-Bluemont Line existed in 2000 and later.

The line connected the W&OD's Great Falls Division (formerly the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad) with the Bluemont Division's Alexandria-Bluemont line.\n\nThe line closed in sections in 1963 and 1968. I–66 and the adjacent Custis Trail replaced the line between Thrifton and Washington Boulevard in Ballston. Arlington County's Bluemont Junction Trail replaced the line between Washington Boulevard and Bluemont Junction.\n\nBluemont Junction, where the Bluemont Junction Trail now meets the W&OD Trail, presently contains an Arlington County railroad display that features a Southern Railway bay window caboose.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nMamburao was originally settled by the Moro people and was one of their strongholds in the island of Mindoro. The settlement was the first one in Mindoro to be plundered by the Spaniards. Hearing that it was a rich town, the Spanish and their Pintado allies attacked and captured the population. The wealthy among their captives were then allowed to ransom themselves free. With their superior weapons and knowledge of war strategies used in their just concluded Reconquista, they utilised this method all around the islands, and by this the Spanish earned their gold.\n\nOn January 1, 1560, wanting more, Miguel López de Legazpi sent a fleet of 15 boats from Panay, led by his grandson Juan de Salcedo, to conquer the Moro town. Another expedition was sent to Mamburao, led by Salcedo and Martin de Goiti, with the intent of establishing Spanish presence in Mindoro.\n\nCatholicism was propagated in Mamburao and the town was placed under the third convent district based in Cavite. Mamburao was subjected to attack by the Mindanao Moro, guided by its former Mamburao inhabitants who wanted to claim their lands and have a prosperous life there between the 17th and 18th centuries. Mamburao, supported by its population, was even made into a sea haven by the Moros, who used it as base of their sea attacks against Friar induced settlements on coastal towns in Mindoro, Luzon and Visayas.\n\nIn the late 19th century, encouraged by Spanish authorities promising them rich lands to till, with weapons but in exchange for working as its ready foot soldiers on quick notice, Mamburao then saw an influx of Ilocano and Tagalog immigrants.\n\nNear the end of the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, the settlement of Sablayan was incorporated to Mamburao as a barrio. In 1905 Paluan and Abra de Ilog were likewise incorporated under Act 1280. Abra de Ilog, Paluan and Sablayan were later carved out from Mamburao as separate municipalities. Another barrio of Mamburao, Santa Cruz, was also made into a separate municipality.\n\nMamburao was designated as the capital of Occidental Mindoro when the island province of Mindoro was divided into two separate provinces on June 13, 1950: Oriental and Occidental Mindoro.\n\nMamburao is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Eight barangays are found in the population created under P.D. 86 and seven are outside the poblacion area.\n\nTricycles are a common mode of transportation in Mamburao. Vans, jeepneys, and buses are also available and are a means of traveling to other parts of the island of Mindoro such as the port of Abra de Ilog and the southern municipality of San Jose. Mamburao Airport serves chartered flights, although Philippine Airlines used to schedule regular flights at the airport.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Local Government Finance, the annual regular revenue of Mamburao for the fiscal year of 2016 was ₱132,318,636.29.\n\nThe economy of Mamburao is highly dependent on its agricultural produce. The two major crops are rice and corn. Rice production accounts to 25,527.80 MT with 4.484 MT/ha while corn production accounts to 16,273.60 MT or 7 MT/ha. This production has increased in both area and volume in the year 2016 to 2017. Exportation to Region IV-A or CALABARZON is also one of the municipality's roles.\n\nAdditionally, agricultural production is also varied with some farmers venturing on cassava, onion, mango, legumes, watermelon, and other products. There are also several livestock and dairy farmers particularly in Barangays Balansay, Tayamaan, and Payompon while there are also poultry farmer in Barangays Fatima, Balansay, Payompon, and Tayamaan.\n\nFisheries and aquaculture also play a vital role in the economy of the municipality. Among the three sectors of the fishing industry, marine fishery is the most prominent with Barangays Talabaan, Fatima, Balansay, Payompon, Poblacion 2, Poblacion 7, and Tayamaan being engaged in it. Products include yellow fin tuna, giant squid, roundscad/galunggong, lapu-lapu, Spanish mackerel, dalagang bukid, dilis, talakitok, bisugo, stonefish, prawns, crabs, and lobsters. Among these, yellow fin tuna, giant squid, and lobsters are exported to Europe, Japan, Dubai, and Hongkong.\n\nIn terms of Mamburao's commerce and trade, a concentration of commercial areas is seen in the Poblacion barangays as well as in Barangay Payompon. In 2017, there was a total of 701 establishments with space rental having the highest count. General merchandise stores are also numerous in the municipality. Local revenue has also accounted to more than 1 billion coming from commerce and trade. Industry, on the other hand, account to more than 47 million with several bagoong making establishments, rice mills, ice plants, and others. Some of these establishments also export to neighboring municipalities as well as in CALABARZON.\n\nElected local government officials (2019-2022):\n\n\n\"Ex Officio\" members:\n\n\n"}

According to folk history, its former name was \"Abre de Ilog\". The name was derived from the Spanish verb \"abrir\" (to open) and the Tagalog noun \"ilog\" (river). Later on, the name evolved into its present name: Abra de Ilog, a Chabacano-like terminology which can be loosely translated as \"bucana ng ilog\", or \"opening of the river.\" This can be attributed to the numerous rivers and creeks that traverses strategic areas of the municipality.\n\nIn 1902, during the American Occupation the town was officially organized.

The early settlers then of the barrio were Boholanos. They found so many stray animals along the river, thus they named the place Layawan, which means a place of stray animals. A little later, Misamis was divided into two provinces, Misamis Occidental and Oriental. Then in 1880, Layawan changed its name to Oroquieta when it became a town.\n\nOroquieta became the capital (\"cabecera\") on January 6, 1930. As capital town, people of various neighboring provinces came and inhabited in the place where they earn their living through fishing, farming, merchandising and other forms of businesses. Soon afterwards its income increased simultaneously with increase in population.\n\nIn 1942, Oroquieta was made the capital of the free Philippines by the recognized guerrillas and later the ongoing troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. (Personal interview with the late Atty. Vicente Blanco, Municipal Mayor during the Japanese Occupation) During this time, President Manuel L. Quezon, together with Sergio Osmeña Sr., a bodyguard and Major Manuel Nieto Sr., landed in Oroquieta after their evacuation from Corregidor to Australia.\n\nThe seat of government of the Free Philippines then was the Capitol. The Free Philippine Government was then issuing Misamis Occidental emergency notes. President Quezon, upon knowing that Oroquieta was made a capital of the Free Philippines and that the town was issuing emergency notes, authorized the Printing of the Mindanao emergency note.\n\nOroquieta was created a city under Republic Act 5518 and inaugurated as a chartered city on January 1, 1970. The charter converting the municipality of Oroquieta into a city were signed by President Marcos on June 25, 1969, in the presence of the then City Mayor Ciriaco C.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAlthough occasionally spelled as Ozamis in official sources, City Resolution 251-05 officially spelled Ozamiz with a \"z\" as its last letter rather than with an \"s\".\n\nOzamiz is close to Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte provinces, while across the bay is Lanao del Norte. Ozamiz is from Maria Cristina Falls, the main source of hydroelectric power in Mindanao.\n\nOzamiz is politically subdivided into 51 barangays.\n\nThe city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called Misamis—a name believed to have been derived from the Subanen word \"\"Kuyamis\",\" a variety of coconut. Other unverified historical sources, however, suggest that the name Misamis came from \"\"Misa\"\" after the Catholic Mass. The origin and the growth of the old Spanish town, Misamis, was due to the presence of the Spanish garrison stationed at the stone fort named Nuestra Senora dela Concepcion del Triunfo, which was constructed some time in the 18th century in order to control the pirate activities originating in the nearby Lanao area. In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the District of Misamis.\n\nIn October 1942 Wendell Fertig established the command headquarters of the growing guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of Mindanao in the Spanish fort in the city. His headquarters was abandoned June 26, 1943, in the face of a large Japanese attack. Until the end of the war the Japanese occupied this fort. The Ozamiz city website said of this, \"During the Japanese occupation of Misamis in World War II(1943-1945), the \"Cotta\" was garrisoned by a contingent of Japanese who dug foxholes near or under the walls. This undermining of walls later led to the destruction of the Southwest bastion in the earthquake of 1955.\"\n\nAfter the Second World War, Misamis became a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act 321 on July 16, 1948. RA 321 also renamed Misamis to Ozamiz after a WW-II hero José Ozámiz who hailed from the province of Misamis Occidental and who at one time also served as its governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of Misamis Occidental, a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth Government. In 1941, José Ozámiz was elected to the Philippine Senate.\n\nIn the , the population of Ozamiz was people, with a density of .\n\nOzamiz is agricultural by resources, but it has become the center for commerce, health, transportation, and education in this part of Mindanao, considering its strategic location and its peaceful atmosphere. The city has good harbor location, its local port is the principal outlet of mineral deposits, agricultural and forest products of the provinces of Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Maguindanao, parts of Lanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur.\n\nDue to the location of the city, Ozamiz enjoys several notable shopping centers within its city center. People from Misamis Occidental, parts of Lanao del Norte and parts of Zamboanga del Sur will come also to Ozamiz for their shopping needs.\n\nGaisano Capital Mall Ozamiz is the biggest mall in the city with the expansion of a new South Wing Mall in 2011. Novo Ozamiz also expand and construct their own bigger building with a hotel named Asia Novotel in 2010. Unitop Ozamiz also expand their building in 2012 in front of City Public Mall with a bridge for an easy access from the 2nd floor of both buildings. City Public Mall, formerly known as City Public Market, is the biggest public establishment in Northwestern Mindanao. It is owned and managed by the Ozamiz government and opened on May 28, 2009. \nRobinsons Supermarket opened to the public on November 30, 2012. \nPuregold Ozamiz opened in the year of 2019 with the first ever 7-11 Convenience Store serving the developing city.\n\nElected and appointed public officials have governed Ozamiz since its founding, with a strong mayor-council government. The city political government is composed of the mayor, vice mayor, Ten councilors, one Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Federation representative, one (IPMR) Representative and an Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) representative.

Balanghoy Festival is held annually at Cotta area.\n\n\nOzamiz Airport, also known as Labo Airport, was reopened July 5, 2007, 9 years after Philippine Airlines (PAL) stopped their operations using Fokker 50 and Sunriser planes and eventually went the airport to its closure due to its short runway in which cannot accommodate jet planes. Air Philippines, (a subsidiary airline of PAL), was the first airline served the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila using a B737-200 which is also the first jet plane to land the airport while PAL Express (another PAL subsidiary), was then served direct flights to the Mactan–Cebu International Airport again using their Bombardier Q400.\n\nPAL's competitor, Cebu Pacific Air later opened their service in Ozamiz with its first flight to Cebu on November 10, 2008 using their brand-new ATR72-500. With high demand of passengers, cargo and tourist arrivals, Cebu Pacific then launched its Manila route with their Airbus 319, while PAL took over Air Philippines service to Manila using also the Airbus 319 last June 16, 2009.\n\nWhen Air Philippines took its rebranding as Airphil Express (now PAL Express), it then relaunched its Ozamiz to Manila flight last August 18, 2011 using their Airbus A320. It then forces Cebu Pacific to change its aircraft to replace all of their ATR72-500 that serves Ozamiz Airport to an Airbus A319 and Airbus A320. Despite fierce competition between PAL and Cebu Pacific, PAL ended their operations in Ozamiz last March 25, 2012, leaving their affiliate PAL Express to compete with Cebu Pacific. Since then, the competition between PAL Express and Cebu Pacific became the duopoly in serving to and from the airport.\n\nOzamiz Airport will undergo a P300M expansion and development with installation of runway lights, extension of runway from its current of length 1.9 km to 2.1 km and construction of a new passenger terminal building.\n\nThere are several major shipping lines serving Cebu, Manila and Iligan routes namely: 2GO Travel (formerly SuperFerry, Negros Navigation and Cebu Ferries), Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, Cokaliong Shipping Lines, Carlos A.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe Municipal Government of Plaridel was one of the original towns of the Province of Misamis before it was divided into two (2) provinces (Oriental & Occidental) under Legislative Act. No. 3537 passed November 2, 1929.\n\nSubanon people, also known as Suban-on, Subanons or Subanens are the original settlers of the town. The word \"Suba\" means a river, while the suffix -nun or -nen means place of origin, attributing that Subanens were river dwellers. They cultivated vast lands along Langaran River, from the word “LANGANAN”, the local term for “delay”. A river so named because of its circuitous, winding route that traverses many kilometers. This river then was the highway by which people travelled on to reach the different settlements located along the riverbanks. Tales have it that the first Spaniard who arrived in one of the riverbank settlements asked what the name of the place was. Thinking that the Spaniard was asking for the name of the river, the settlers answered, “LANGANAN”.\n\nThe Spaniard found it hard to pronounce and instead uttered “LANGARAN” . This became the name of the place which now is the Municipality of Plaridel. Original settlers of LANGARAN were the Subanens. Farming, fishing and hunting were their means of livelihood. With their slash and burn (Kaingin) way of farming, they opened tracts of land for agricultural purposes. These tracts were later on bartered for axe heads and salt with the migrants.\n\nThe town named Langaran was changed into “Plaridel” in the year 1907, when the late Santos Palma was elected municipal President.

Paopao played 11 seasons in the CFL and was a member of the BC Lions, Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Ottawa Rough Riders. He began his coaching career with the BC Lions and has coached with five CFL organizations, including stints as head coach with the BC Lions in 1996 and the Ottawa Renegades from 2002–2005. He most recently served as the quarterbacks coach for the Ottawa Redblacks.\n\nPaopao began his CFL career as a quarterback for the BC Lions in 1978. He was nicknamed the \"Throwin' Samoan\" for his great ability to pass, as he led the Lions in passing for the next three seasons and set a CFL record in 1979 for pass completions in a single game. By 1983, he had lost the starting job to Roy Dewalt. In 1984 he signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders and again led that team in passing. He was traded to the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1987, and the following year to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. That year, he was named the offensive backfield coach of the BC Lions, thus beginning his CFL coaching career. The next year however, he went back to his old position of quarterback for the Lions, backing up Doug Flutie, in his last season.\n\nIn 1991, Paopao was made the quarterback coach of the Lions. In 1992 he was promoted to offensive coordinator. Paopao was with the Lions for four seasons to begin his coaching career. Paopao then left to be the offensive coordinator for the Edmonton Eskimos in 1994. In 1996 Paopao returned to BC to be the head coach, but he only managed to win 5 games and lost 13 during his only season as the Lions head coach. Following his first stint as a head coach Paopao was hired by the Bluie Bombers as the teams offensive coordinator, a position which he held for two seasons. He once again returned to the Lions in 1999 and as the offensive coordinator and assistant head coach. \n\nPaopao was hired as the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco Demons of the XFL. The league was operational for only one season, and thus Paopao was once again looking for work.\n\nIn 2001 Paopao was hired as the head coach of the new Ottawa Renegades franchise where he coached for four seasons from 2002-2005. However, the Renegades struggled, winning only 23 games and losing 49, the team folded following the 2005 season. Paopao was then hired by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and named offensive coordinator for the 2006 season. He was later relieved of his duties with the Tiger-Cats on August 28, 2006.\n\nPaopao joined the University of Waterloo Warriors as the team's offensive coordinator and assistant head coach in 2007, a position he would hold for five years. He was named the team's interim head coach for the 2012 season after Dennis McPhee's resignation, and then full-time head coach in February 2013. In two seasons with the Warriors, Paopao had a 3-13 record. \n\nOn February 6, 2014, the BC Lions announced Paopao would be re-joining the organization as its receivers coach.\n\nOn March 27, 2015 Joe Paopao was named offensive coordinator of the Simon Fraser University Clan football team in the NCAA's Division II Great Northwest Athletic Conference.\n\nOn April 15, 2019 Paopao was hired by the Ottawa Redblacks as a running backs coach. Midway through the 2019 season, with the offense sputtering and the team having lost six of their last seven matches, head coach Rick Campbell turned over the role of offensive play-calling to Paopao: His responsibilities with the team also changed from running backs coach to quarterbacks coach. Following a head coaching change, Paopao was not retained by the Redblacks for the 2020 season.\n\nPaopao is a longtime resident of Oceanside, California.

Acadian settlers colonized the general area in the 18th century, in places such as Bouctouche, Miramichi and Richibucto Village.\n\nThe first English-speaking settler was Thomas Powel who arrived in 1790. There was considerable colonization by English shipbuilders, Scottish merchants and Irish immigrants followed, including many Irish Protestants who arrived to work in the Jardine Shipbuilding Yards around the year 1819. They eventually cleared enough land to receive land grants following the 1820s survey by a Mr. Layton conducted around the Molus River area of nearby Weldford Parish, New Brunswick and the size of Elsipogtog First Nation was reduced to the current boundaries.\n\nTwo ships brought the majority of the settlers here from Scotland, one being the \"Dickies\", captained by Simon Graham, and the other was the \"Isabella\", sailed by Captain Thomas Carruthers.\n\nFishing, lumbering and shipbuilding flourished throughout the 19th century.

It checks for genes that code for specific liver enzymes which activate, deactivate, or are influenced by various drugs.\n\nThere are currently four genetic markers commonly tested for: 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, and 1A2.\n\nThis testing has been done for some time by drug companies working on new drugs, but is relatively newly available to the general public. Strattera is the first drug to mention the test in the official documentation, although it doesn't specifically recommend that patients get the test before taking the medication.\n\nThere are four possible categories for each marker: poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, extensive metabolizer, or ultra-extensive metabolizer. Different testing companies may call these by different names. Extensive metabolizers (that is, people who are extensive metabolizers of a given type) are the most common, and are the type of people for which drugs are designed. Up to 7% of Caucasians are poor metabolizers of drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme.\n\nPeople who cannot metabolize a drug will require a much lower dose than is recommended by the manufacturer, and those who metabolize it quickly may require a higher dose.

He was the second son of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy, and their eldest son to reach adulthood, his older brother Henry having been born and died in the same month of August 1071. Conrad's rule in Lorraine and Germany was nominal. He spent most of his life in Italy and there he was king in fact as well as in name.\n\nConrad was born on 12 February 1074 at Hersfeld Abbey while his father was fighting against the Saxon Rebellion. He was baptised in the abbey three days later. After Henry's victory against the Saxons, he arranged for an assembly at Goslar on Christmas Day 1075 to swear an oath recognising Conrad as his successor. After the death of Duke Godfrey IV of Lower Lorraine on 22 February 1076, Henry refused to appoint the late duke's own choice of successor, his nephew, Godfrey of Bouillon, and instead named his two-year-old son Duke of Lower Lorraine. He did appoint Albert III of Namur, the deceased duke's brother-in-law, as his son's vice-duke (\"vicedux\") to perform the daily functions of government. He also allowed the march of Antwerp to pass to Godfrey of Bouillon. The total absence of Conrad from his duchy caused or abetted the decline of ducal authority in it. In 1082, while Conrad was in Italy, the peace of God was introduced into the diocese of Liège.\n\nConrad passed Christmas 1076 at Besançon with his parents. Early the next year (1077) he accompanied his father across the Alps on the way to Canossa, because there was nobody in Germany to which Henry could entrust his son. Conrad subscribed to his first royal charter in 1079. When Henry returned to Germany, Conrad remained in Italy to act as a pledge to the imperialist party there. He was placed in the care of Archbishop Tedald of Milan and Bishop Denis of Piacenza, both excommunicated prelates and opponents of Pope Gregory VII. In October 1080, Conrad was present in the camp when a force from northern Italy defeated the troops of Marchioness Matilda of Tuscany near Mantua.\n\nIn December 1080, the Saxon lords who had supported the kingship of the late Rudolf of Swabia against Henry gathered \"to discuss the state of their kingdom [Saxony]\" in Bruno of Merseburg's words. Henry sent envoys to the Saxons asking them to accept his son Conrad as their king, and in exchange he promised never to enter Saxony. (Conrad was apparently back in Germany.) Otto of Northeim, speaking for the Saxons, \"desired neither the son nor the father\" since he had \"often seen a bad calf begotten by a bad ox.\"\n\nIn 1081, Henry entered Italy, where he endeavoured to wed his son to a daughter of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia. He offered Robert the march of Fermo as well, but no marriage could be agreed to since the duke refused to do homage for Apulia. Again Henry left Conrad in Italy (July 1081), this time in the care of the lay princes \"to watch over the province for him\", according to the \"Annales Brunwilarenses\" and \"Annales Patherbrunnenses\".\n\nIn 1087, Conrad returned to Germany. On 30 May, he was crowned king in Aachen by Archbishop Sigewin of Cologne. The ceremony was attended by Albert of Namur, Godfrey of Bouillon and Duke Magnus of Saxony, according to the \"Annales Weissenburgenses\". The last reference to Conrad as duke of Lower Lotharingia (\"dux Lothariorum\") comes from a charter issued at Aachen shortly before his coronation, after which Henry appointed Godfrey of Bouillon duke in his place. By January 1088 Conrad had returned to Italy, with Bishop Ogerius of Ivrea as his chancellor and advisor. Shortly after his return to Italy, his mother died. The passing of Bertha perhaps provoked the rupture between Conrad and his father.\n\nIn Italy, Conrad was unsuccessful in resisting Matilda of Tuscany until his father came down in the spring of 1090. In 1091 he was at his father's side, as his \"most beloved son\". On 19 December 1091 Conrad's grandmother, the Margravine Adelaide of Turin, died. She had named her ten-year-old great-grandson, Peter, as her heir following the death of Peter's father, Count Frederick of Montbéliard on 29 June 1091. Henry, however, declared Conrad the rightful heir and placed him in charge of the march. The southern counties meanwhile were seized by Boniface I of Vasto and Henry granted the county of Asti to the bishop elect Oddo. Throughout 1092 Conrad was campaigning in the march of Turin to establish imperial control.\n\nIn 1093, with the support of Matilda and her husband, Welf V, along with the Patarene-minded cities of northern Italy (Cremona, Lodi, Milan and Piacenza), Conrad rebelled against his father. According to Ekkehard of Aura, he was instigated to revolt by \"one of his father's \"ministeriales\", who was likewise named Conrad\". This was perhaps the same person as the Count Conrad sent by the young king as an envoy to King Roger II of Sicily, according to Geoffrey Malaterra. Ekkehard otherwise gives positive account of Conrad's motivation, describing him as \"a thoroughly catholic man, most devoted to the apostolic see, inclining to religion rather than government or war ... well enough furnished with courage and boldness [yet] preferr[ing] to occupy his time with reading rather than with sports\". Other sources favorable to Conrad include the \"Annales sancti Disibodi\" and the \"Casus monasterii Petrishusensis\". Among sources unfavorable to him are the \"Annales Augustani\" and Henry IV's anonymous biography, the \"Vita Heinrici IV\", which describes Conrad as a pawn in hands of Matilda of Tuscany. Bernold of St Blasien records that Henry was so abject after Conrad's rebellion that he attempted suicide, but this may be a hyperbole allusive to the suicide of the biblical King Saul.\n\nIn mid-March Conrad was captured by his father through a ruse, but soon escaped and in late July was elected king by Matilda, Welf and their allies and crowned in Milan by Archbishop Anselm III. According to the historian Landulf Junior, he was also crowned at Monza, where the Iron Crown was being kept. After Conrad's coronation, Anselm died and the new king invested his successor, Arnulf III on 6 December 1093, although many of the bishops present to celebrate his coronation refused to attend the simoniacal investiture of Arnulf. The papal legate who was present, probably to speak with Conrad, immediately declared Arnulf deposed. The accusation might have been that Arnulf had performed undue service to Conrad to secure his investiture, or that he had been too obeisant, a charge of simony \"ab obsequio\". Conrad was at the height of his power in 1094, when his father was staying with Margrave Henry and Patriarch Udalric in the March of Verona, unable to enter Italy. His antipope, Clement III, elected at the Synod of Brixen in 1080, who was travelling with him, even offered to resign so that Henry could negotiate with Pope Urban II if that was all that stood in the way. There is a contemporary tract, \"Altercatio inter Urbanum et Clementum\", arguing the two popes claims should be adjudicated by a council.\n\nIn March 1095 Conrad attended the Council of Piacenza and confirmed the accusations of his stepmother, Eupraxia, that Henry IV was a member of a Nicolaitan sect, participated in orgies, and had offered Eupraxia to Conrad, stating that this was the reason for his turning against his father. Shortly after the council, he swore an oath of loyalty to Pope Urban II on 10 April at Cremona and served as the pope's \"strator\" (groom), leading the pope's horse as a symbolic gesture of humility first performed, according to tradition, by Constantine I. The duty of the \"strator\" had not been performed for a pope since the ninth century, and was revived specifically for Conrad. On 15 April, in a second meeting at Cremona, Conrad swore an oath, either of \"security\" or of \"fealty\", to the pope, guaranteeing the \"life, limb and Roman papacy\" to Urban. This oath was customary for kings who would be crowned emperor, but Conrad went further and promised to forsake lay investiture. Urban in turn promised Conrad \"his advice and aid in obtaining the kingship and the crown of the empire\", probably a promise to crown him in the future, after he had control of the kingdom. By these actions Conrad transformed himself from a rebellious son to a papally-sponsored anti-king and supporter of the Reform movement.\n\nIn the same year, the pope and Matilda of Tuscany helped arrange a marriage of Conrad to Maximilla (also called Matilda), a daughter of Count Roger I of Sicily. Maximilla, escorted by Bishop Robert II of Troina, arrived at Pisa with a large fleet and a dowry of \"many gifts of treasure\". The wedding took place in Pisa in 1095. That same year, Matilda of Tuscany divorced Welf V, whose enraged father, Welf IV, switched allegiance and was restored to the duchy of Bavaria by the emperor in 1096. In 1097, Margrave Adalbert Azzo II died and his vast lands were disputed by his sons. Fulk and Hugh were supporters of Conrad, while Welf IV had sided with the emperor. In a sign of the turning tide, Welf, with the help of Patriarch Udalric and Duke Henry of Carinthia, invaded Italy and secured his claims to the inheritance. This reduced Conrad to total reliance on Matilda of Tuscany.\n\nEarly during the episcopate of Anselm IV of Milan, Conrad lost the support of the papalists in Lombardy. He once rhetorically asked Liutprand, one of the leaders of the Pataria, \"Since you are a teacher of Patarenes, what do you think of bishops and priests who possess royal rights and present not food to the king?\" Without Matilda's support, Conrad became a supporter of the Pataria. The historian Landulf Junior praised Conrad for refusing investiture to neither Arimanno da Gavardo, the bishop-elect of Brescia, nor to Anselm IV.\n\nIn April or May 1098 at an assembly held in Mainz, Conrad's father had him formally deposed and his younger brother, Henry V, elected in his place. In a letter of 1106, Henry admitted that Henry V's election had been opposed by many and that he \"fear[ed] that there would be civil war between the two brothers and that a great disaster would befall the kingdom.\"\n\nAfter this, Conrad could hardly influence political events in Italy. There is no record that Urban or his successor had any contact with him, or that his father-in-law ever sent him support beyond his daughter's dowry. He died unexpectedly of a fever at the age of twenty-eight on 27 July 1101 in Florence. There were reports of poisoning. He was buried in Santa Reparata in Florence, now superseded by Santa Maria del Fiore. Miracles were said to have accompanied his funeral. According to Ekkehard of Aura, \"the sign of the cross [appeared] on the arm\" of Conrad's corpse, a clear indication that he was a crusader in spirit. Ekkehard also states that Conrad never tolerated any slander against his father, and always referred to him as lord and emperor.\n\n"}

It is also the third oldest royal city in the country.According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town was established in 1575 by order of Spanish Governor-General Francisco de Sande. The city, then named Ciudad de Nueva Cáceres (New Cáceres City), was the third Spanish royal city in the Spanish East Indies, after Iloilo and Manila.\n\nGeographically and statistically classified, as well as legislatively represented within Camarines Sur, but administratively independent of the provincial government, Naga is the Bicol Region's trade, business, religious, cultural, industrial, commercial, medical, educational, and financial center. It was awarded the title of \"Most Competitive Component City in the Philippines\", along with being the \"Center of Good Governance in the Philippines\".\n\nNaga is known as the \"Queen City of Bicol\", and as the \"Heart of Bicol\", due to its central location on the Bicol Peninsula; and as the \"Pilgrim City\" because Naga is also the destination of the largest Marian pilgrimage in Asia, the Our Lady of Peñafrancia, whose image is one of the most popular objects of devotion in the country. Naga is also known as \"One of the Seven Golden Cities of the Sun\" as stated by Nick Joaquin.\n\nThe city is the seat of the metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Caceres, whose jurisdiction includes all the suffragan sees of Bicol.\n\nIt is one of the two Philippine cities named Naga, the other being Naga City in Cebu.\n\nThe region of Bicol was closely allied with the Kedatuan of Madja-as confederation, which was located on Panay island. According to the Maragtas, two datus and their followers, who followed Datu Puti, arrived at Taal Lake, with one group later settling around Laguna de Bay, and another group pushing southward into the Bicol peninsula, placing the Bicolanos between people from Luzon and people from the Visayas. An ancient tomb preserved among the Bicolanos, discovered and examined by anthropologists during the 1920s, refers to some of the same deities and personages mentioned in the \"Maragtas\".\n\nIn 1573, on his second expedition to this region, the conquistador Juan de Salcedo landed in a village and named it Naga because of the abundance of narra trees (\"naga\" in Bikol).\n\nIn 1575, Captain Pedro de Chávez, the commander of the garrison left behind by Salcedo, founded on the site of the present business centre (across the river from the original Naga) a Spanish city which he named La Ciudad de Cáceres, in honor of Francisco de Sande, the governor-general and a native of the city of Cáceres in Spain. It was by this name that it was identified in the papal bull of August 14, 1595, which established the see of Cáceres, together with those of Cebú and Nueva Segovia, and made it the seat of the new bishopric under the archdiocese of Manila.\n\nIn time, the Spanish city and the native village merged into one community and became popularly known as Nueva Cáceres, to distinguish it from its namesake in Spain. It had a city government as prescribed by Spanish law, with an \"ayuntamiento\" and \"cabildo\" of its own. At the beginning of the 17th century, there were only five other \"ciudades\" in the Philippines. Nueva Cáceres remained the capital of the Ambos Camarines provinces and later of the Camarines Sur province until the formal creation of the independent chartered city of Naga under the Philippine Republic.\n\nFor hundreds of years during the Spanish colonial era, Naga grew to become the center of trade, education, and culture, and the seat of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Bicol.\n\nWith the advent of American rule, the city was reduced to a municipality. In 1919, it lost its Spanish name and became officially known as Naga.\n\nNaga came under Japanese occupation on December 18, 1941, following the Japanese invasion of Legaspi a few days earlier.\n\nIn 1945, toward the end of World War II, combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth troops—of the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary, as well as Bicolano guerrilla resistance groups—liberated Naga from imperial Japanese troops.\n\nAfter Naga was liberated from the Japanese, Naga began rebuilding. Having suffered only a few casualties, Naga was able to rebuild quickly after the war. After many petitions, Naga became a city on June 18, 1948, when it acquired its present city charter; and its city government was inaugurated on December 15 of the same year by virtue of Republic Act No. 305.\n\nNaga is located within the province of Camarines Sur at the southeastern tip of Luzon, southeast of Manila, the nation's capital, and near the center of the Bicol Region. It is surrounded on all sides by forests and by rich agricultural and fishing areas. It has an area of and is located on the serpentine and historic Naga River, at the confluence of the Naga and Bikol rivers. Thus, it has always been an ideal place for trade, and as center for schools, church, and government offices. Included in its territory is Mount Isarog, a declared protected area known as Mount Isarog Natural Park.\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Naga has a tropical savanna climate.\n\nThe weather in the city from March to May is hot and dry, with temperatures ranging from . The typhoon season is from June to October, and the weather then is generally rainy. From November to February, the climate is cooler with temperatures ranging from . The average year-round humidity is 77%.\n\nNaga is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\n\nThe city is the ecclesiastical seat of the Archdiocese of Caceres, which oversees the Catholic population in the Bicol Region, whose archbishop is the primate of the region. This dominant faith is supported by the presence of old and influential Catholic institutions, from universities to churches run by different religious institutes, notably the Ateneo de Naga University by the Jesuits; the Universidad de Santa Isabel by the Daughters of Charity; the Naga Metropolitan Cathedral, which is the oldest cathedral that is still standing in Luzon outside Metro Manila; Peñafrancia Basilica Minore, which is the largest Catholic structure in Southern Luzon in terms of size and land area; Our Lady of Peñafrancia Shrine; the historic San Francisco Church; and Peñafrancia Museum.\n\nProtestant denominations in the city include Seventh-day Adventists and Bible Baptists, whose churches are located along Magsaysay Avenue, while other Protestants attend the Methodist Church which is among the old structures along Peñafrancia Avenue.\n\nThe \"Assemblies of God\" maintains a fast-growing ministry in Naga. Aside from Naga Bethel Church (formerly Naga Bethel Temple), which is located on Felix Plazo Street, other local congregations are Philippians Christian Fellowship (in barangays San Felipe), Gethsemane Christian Ministries (in Carolina), and outreach ministries in other barangays.\n\nThe largest minority religion in Naga is Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC). INC has several chapels in different barangays in the city, and the local congregation is the largest in the district.\n\nThere is also a concentration of Jesus Miracle Crusade ministries in the city.\n\nMuslims, Sikhs, and Taoists can also be found in the city.\n\nThe Coastal Bikol-Central dialect of the Coastal Bikol language is the dominant dialect spoken by the population in Naga. Central Standard Bikol is also the basis for other dialects in the Bicol Region. The majority of the city's population can understand and speak English, Filipino, and Tagalog. Because of the influx of people from the Rinconada area that are studying in different universities, Rinconada Bikol can also be heard in different schools and throughout the city. Some Nagueños have varying degrees of proficiency with Rinconada Bikol, due to the fact that the southern half of Pili, which is the boundary between Rinconada Bikol and Coastal Bikol speakers, is just few kilometers away from Naga. Although the main language is Bikol, and the medium of instruction in school is English, people in Naga usually tell time and count in Spanish.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd volume of \"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\", where three critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these is the \"Isarog Agta\" language, of the Isarog Agta people, who live on Mount Isarog and are one of the original Negrito settlers in the Philippines, belonging to the Aeta people classification but with language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.\n\nOnly five Isarog Agta spoke their indigenous language in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, speak the language partially and infrequently, and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren. If the remaining 150 Isarog Agta do not pass their native language to the next generation, it will be extinct within one to two decades.\n\nNaga is the Bicol Region's center of commerce and industry. Strategically located at the heart of Bicol, Naga is the trade center in Bicol for goods from Visayas and Manila.\n\nNaga is cited as one of the \"Most Business-Friendly Cities in Asia\", is considered to be one of the Philippines's Top-10 cities, and is a \"most competitive city\" of the Philippines. Some entrepreneurs cited the city as the most business-friendly in the region.\n\nDowntown Naga is located in the southern part of the city. It is bordered, on the north, by the Naga University Belt and, on the south, by the historical Naga City Peoples Mall or simply Naga City Community Supermarket.

Starting on the second Friday of September each year, the 10-day feast, the largest Marian devotion in the country. The start of the festival is signalled by a procession (or \"Translacion\") when the centuries-old image of the Blessed Virgin Mary is transferred from its shrine at the Peñafrancia Basilica Minore de Nuestra Señora de Peñafrancia to the 400-year-old Naga Metropolitan Cathedral. Coinciding with nine days of novena prayer at the cathedral, the city celebrates with parades, pageants, street parties, singing contests, exhibits, concerts, and other activities. Finally, on the third Saturday of September, the image is returned, shoulder-borne by so-called \"voyadores\", to the basilica via the historic Naga River.

Kinalas is from the old Bicol word \"kalas\", which refers to the \"fall off the bone\" meat that is placed on top of the noodles. The soup is the broth of beef bone and bone marrow (sometimes skull and brain included) or what Manileños call \"bulalo\". The soup is topped with very tender meat slices that also came from the pig's head. It is usually served hot with an egg, and sprinkled with roasted garlic and spring onions. Kalamansi and patis may be added according to taste.

There are 1,500 units available for hire while 1,150 are for private use. There is now stiffer competition among drivers, which creates a wide range of problems, such as fare overcharging, refusal to convey passengers, an uneven distribution of trimobile service resulting in a shortage of transport service in some areas of the city, and rampant traffic violations.\n\nPadyaks can be used in subdivision and barangay transportation.

These people founded a permanent settlement in an area close to the lake and flourished as time passed.\n\nThe general exodus of people fleeing and being able to escape grave calamities such as Mayon's eruption was known in local vernacular as \"naka-buhi\". Local lore takes this as the most probable explanation as to how the town acquired its present name – Buhi. One version of local legend attributes the town being accorded the name to the time when the first Spaniards came and asked local settlers the name of the area. The local settlers misunderstood the question as how they came to be there and so gave the response \"Naka-Buhi\".\n\nThere were two patron saints with whom the town directed their devotion. The first was St. Francis of Assisi placed in the church made of wooden materials. Unfortunately, in 1730 the church was razed down by fire.

The other premier towns were Naga, Quipayo and Nabua. The Spaniards who first came to this place asked the men who were splitting bamboos about the name of the place, and since they did not understand the language, they thought that they were being asked about the name of the bamboo, and so they got the answer \"Bu-la\". And so Bula became the name of the town.\n\nBula is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Pili and Ocampo, on the east by the municipality of Baao, on the southeast by the Municipality of Nabua, on the south it is bounded by the Municipality of Balataan, on the southwest by Ragay Gulf, and on the west by the Municipality of Minalabac. It is approximately southwest of Naga City.\n\nBula is politically subdivided into 33 barangays.\nThe Municipality of Bula is historically one of the first four mission towns of Camarines Sur founded by Spanish conquistadores in 1576. Bula was established together with Quipayo, Naga and Nabua. However, it was only in 1578 when the natives where Christianized, so the National Historical Commission dates back our history to 1578. From this historical fact, Bula, whose chosen Saint is St. Mary Magdalene celebrates its fiesta every 22nd day of July, which is the birthdate of the Saint.\n\nIn the , the population of Bula, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nMajority of the people speak the Bula-Pili variant, a lowland dialect (sinaranəw) of Rinconada Bikol language, also known as Riŋkonāda.

It has 11 coastal barangays.\n\nIn 1578 when the head Mission of Quipayo was established, Calabanga was only a visita or barrio. At that time, the place had vast forests and swamps and an abundance of wildlife such as monkeys, wild chickens, and forest lizard. Others say, it derived its name from the Bicol word “Calabangan”, the plural term of “labang” or “litag”, meaning a kind of snare for catching wild animals. Another legend says that Calabanga originated from the word “Calagbangan” meaning the wide, long, and straight street spanning from the church through the poblacion, east to west, called locally as “calabaan” or “calacbangan”.\n\nCalabanga became known with 400 tributes. On July 15, 1749, it was separated from Quipayo by virtue of the approval of Don Fray Joan de Arechera, Bishop Elect of Nueva Segovia of the Commissary of the King, in the petition signed & filed by 37 Calabangueños on April 28, 1749 for town to be conveniently administered.\n\nThere were 2 visitas, visita de Cagapad and visita de hinarijan and 12 barrios.

One of these languages in the Isarog Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 5 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language.

Nipa shingle production is also one industry predominant at western barangays where nipa swamps could be found. The products are sold not only within the municipality but to nearby towns and Naga City.\n\nThe presence of a new Calabanga Public Market which started operation last 1998 finally resolved the demands for a bigger marketing center, while Cooperatives throughout the municipality are gradually developing its enterprises.\n\nThe municipality is home to two malls, the LCC Center Calabanga which is located in the poblacion of the town, and the small Quipayo Community Center.\n\nProduces the following products:\n\nMost people are farmers and fishermen.\n\nCalabanga is endowed with abundant water resources.

Famous among the scenic beauties are the group of small islets/islands of Kawit, Tanglad, and Cabgan which is a few minutes from the shore. These islands are frequently visited by excursionists particularly during summer but these places need more development. Other places that invite picnickers to its cool and clear water are Tigman, Hinaguianan and Inarihan rivers and private commercial resorts.\nHistorical sites worthy to see is the “Ladrillo” or a brick old church and ruins of Quipayo built sometime in 1578, more than four (4) centuries ago, being the seat of the Catholic mission. Another is the “HINULID”, Santo Entiero shrine at Santa Salud which is an object of Friday devotion and pilgrimage. Thousands of devotees not only from Calabanga but other parts of Bicol Region and the country flock to the shrine during Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.\n\nThe literacy rate in the municipality is high at 98.5%. The NSO survey in year 2000 for household population, 5 years old and over in terms of educational attainment, reflects the following; of the total population, 29,555 are in the elementary grade; 15,037 are in high school; only 2,623 or 0.045% of the population has no grade completed. 4, 446 are college under graduates with 1,057 degree holders and 201 with post baccalaureate degrees.\n\nThere are 38 public elementary schools in the entire municipality; eight high schools; one vocational and some five private schools that offer pre-school, grade school and high school. College education is being offered by two government- owned institutions, the Calabanga Community College and the Central Bicol State University of Agriculture (formerly : CSSAC - Calabanga Campus and privately owned computer Schools, one of which offer a multi- grade schooling from elementary to college levels (Malayan Computer College).(edited last Dec.3,2009 by Gilbert Caganda).\n\nElected officials June 2013 – 2016:\n\n"}

Although there is a separation of church and state, as stated in the country's constitution, the Catholic Church as an institution occupies a very high position in the society. The present pastoral program is geared toward organizing and strengthening the SKK (saradit na kristiyanong komunidad) which means BEC, basic ecclesial community. Rev. Fr.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is home to the oldest known pre-colonial site in the Bicol region, dating 500 AD to 600 AD, making it an undeclared important archaeological zone.\n\nThe origin of the town and its name can be traced back to the early settlers of the place. Known as the \"cortadores\", or woodcutters, to the early Spanish colonizers who came to the place in the early 1700s, the settlers cut timbers from nearby mountains located upriver or around San Miguel Bay and made this as their form of living. Out of these timbers, they hewed out canoes or \"bancas\" which they stored under small sheds or huts. Later, when these sheds became abundant in the area, as they were made the permanent dwelling places by these canoe makers, the place was called \"Camaligan\", which means \"a place where many sheds can be found\", by combining the root word \"kamalig\" (or shed) and the locative suffix \"-an\". The sheds served to shelter the canoe makers and protect their boats from the natural elements. Hence, the name and origin of the town is historically tied to the Bicol River and its early inhabitants.\n\n\"Catagbacan\" was the oldest known name of Camaligan. Moreover, according to D. Adolfo Puya y Ruiz, in his \"“Camarines Sur – Descripcion General De Està Provincia En Luzon”\" (Manila: 1887), Camaligan was called \"Kinamaligan\" before.\n\nWith an area of , it is the smallest municipality in Camarines Sur, but it is the densest, having an approximation of 5,200 persons per square kilometer, which is almost twice the density of the neighboring City of Naga of 2,456 per square kilometer.\n\nCamaligan is politically subdivided into 13 barangays.\n\nCamaligan has a significant amount of rainfall during the year. This is true even for the driest month. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Camaligan has a tropical rainforest climate or Af. The average annual temperature is 27.1 °C in Camaligan. About 2527 mm of precipitation falls annually.\n\nThe town of Camaligan is a known archeological site. In 2016 to 2017, hundreds of artifacts, including shells, jar fragments, tools, other deposits, pig bones, deer bones, stingray cartilage, shark cartilage, and at least fifteen (15) pre-colonial human remains, were found in the area, which marked a revolutionary phase in Bicol archaeology. The shells and tools found in the town was dated back 1,500 years ago or approximately 500 to 600 AD. The site contained no trace of Chinese, Southeast Asian, or South Asian trade links, making Camaligan a pure pre-colonial Bicolano site.\nThe settlers of the religious visita of Nueva Caceres, which was then under its ecclesiastical jurisdiction, arrived in the town by the 17th century. The pre-colonial cemetery and community center were transformed by the Spanish into the town's current church compound to diminish native belief systems and instill catholicism. During this time, Camaligan had five barrios in its jurisdiction, namely Marupit, Doncal (now Dugcal), Sua, San Roque and Tarosanan. Each barrio has a small wooden chapel.\n\nOn 5 June 1795, a petition to the Spanish religious authorities was sent by the natives and signed by the supposedly officials of the place, to request for a resident curate. The officials’ names were Andre Casa, Diego, Lobao, Simeon de la Cruz, Manuel del Espiritu Santo, Fernando Valenzuela, Agustin del Espiritu Santo, Marcos David, Domingo Flores, Pedro Negre, Bartolome Rodriguez and Valentine de los Santos. Fray Rafael de Benavente was appointed as the first parish priest.\n\nIn 1902, the municipality was officially established through an act of the Philippine legislature. It also named Pedro Bustamante as the first municipal mayor. This event of the creation of the Municipality of Camaligan was brought about by a historical fact when the town was eventually separated from being as an annex of Nueva Caceres (now Naga City).\n\nIn the , the population of Camaligan was people, with a density of .\n\nBicol River serves as a natural source of irrigation and fertilization to the town where agriculture is still considered as a major industry.\n\nOut of the 468 hectares total land area, 175 hectares are devoted to rice production, all of which are irrigated and fertilized by the river through its occasional flooding.\n\nCamaligan is being headed by a mayor who is being elected by its residents.\n\nThe current mayor of the town is Marilou Marquez-Hirose. Last May 2019 Election, she has been re-elected for her third and last term as the Municipal Mayor.\n\nSince 1902, thirty (30) mayors already headed the town.\n\nThe people of Camaligan derived their socio-cultural identity as river people from the existence of the river. Bicol River is an important resource for irrigation and fertilization of the land where agriculture and fishing is still considered as a major industry. The place’s festivals, songs and dances found their roots and inspiration from the river. Hence, the river ecology has bred its own distinct community.\n\nReligious and cultural festivals are being held in the town. \n\nSt. Anthony of Padua Parish Church is one of the oldest churches in the province of Camarines Sur. The church is one of the favorite spots for Visita Iglesia in the province.\n\nSanto Domingo Chapel is an old chapel which was a former burial ground during pre-colonial times. It is a central archeological site where a lot of burial jars, porcelains and skeleton bones were found during the diggings.\n\nSira, or fish, is a small wharf painted with festive colors that is constructed on the riverside of barangay San Francisco. This also serves as a dock for \"banca\" passengers.\n\nAfter the initial launching of Camaligan River Park in 1 June 2014, its tourism industry began to be more active. Its continuous improvements attracted many visitors, mostly coming from the City of Naga, to come and enjoy walking along the riverside.\n\nM/B \"Camaligan\" is a motorboat which docks beside Camaligan River Park. Also known as Camaligan River Cruise, it is also a floating restaurant which crosses the Bicol River. Launched last 6 February 2019, it is the newest attraction which promotes the river culture of the town.\n\nCamaligan is Bicol region's oldest known pre-colonial site, filled with numerous stone tools, jar fragments, shell middens, pig and deer bones, shark and ray cartilages, and other artifacts and biofacts. The site also homes to fifteen human skeletons of pre-colonial Ibalons. The site is so rare and vital as it does not contain any evidences of trade contact with China, Southeast Asian neighbors or South Asia, making it one of the very few pre-colonial sites in the Philippines with distinct Filipino artifacts and biofacts unaffected by outside trade. Both the University of the Philippines and University of California, Los Angeles have been pushing for the town's declaration as an \"Important Archaeological Site.\" Scholars have also been pushing for the site's nomination in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nIn a documentary made by GMA News TV, it was found that the artifacts and biofacts were not limited to the town proper. In fact, during a road-widening project conducted in September 2017 by the national government, hundreds of human bone fragments, animal bones, burial and ceremonial jar fragments, and stone tools were found after digging only the edges of the road. The documentary also found many Camaligueños to own artifacts they have found in their own land. Due to these findings, the town's reputation as a vital pre-colonial Ibalon archaeological site was solidified.\n\nCamaligan has one (1) high school, six (6) elementary schools and thirteen (13) preschools. At present, there is no existing tertiary school in the town.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe area that is now Canaman used to very thickly forested. According to Fr. Frank Lynch, S.J., who said that Canaman is the purest among Bicol dialects: “The name Canaman is locally said to be derived from the root \"kana\", meaning \"building materials\". The suffix -\"man\" is taken as a locative, the name thus indicating “place where there are building materials”.\n\nSpanish colonization in Canaman began around the 1580s when some Nueva Caceres-based missionaries apparently on their way back from gospel work in either the visita of Quipayo (now Calabanga) or San Gabriel (now a barangay of Pamplona), got their bearings confused and, thinking they were turning eastward from the Bicol River to its Naga tributary, instead entered the Canaman creek which at the time was still a deep and fast flowing stream. They continued paddling until they ended up at a native settlement in what is now the barangay of Poro.\n\nIn June 1583, the place was organized into a parish, administered by Fray Pedro Matias de Andrade, a Franciscan who later became the fifth Bishop of Diocese of Caceres. In the 1590s, its church was constructed, which was rebuilt in 1669. The patron saint at that time was San Roque, whose image, said to have come all the way from Spain was met at its arrival by the people of Canaman in the shores of Pasacao.\n\nIn 1900, after militant Canamanons heard that the Americans were closing in, they burned the church to the ground in an act of self-immolation to prevent desecration of the church at the hands of the new imperialists. The burning was a deliberate and intentional act: the arsonists even gathered and piled on top of the church’s expensive organ dry grass and big tree branches to which they touched the match, to make certain that the fire consumed all combustible parts of the 231-year-old building and its interiors.\n\nIn 1902, during the provincial governorship of Captain George Curry, the Municipality of Canaman and its office of the \"presidente municipal\" was dissolved and lost its independent existence. Canaman was annexed to Nueva Caceres (now Naga City), though some barrio were attached to Magarao and Canaman’s top position of presidente municipal was downgraded to \"concejal encargado\".\n\nPublic educational system reached Canaman in 1903 with the arrival of a certain Miss Long, an American schoolteacher. She opened the first school now known as Canaman Central School in Dinaga, at the house of Don Basilio Severo (at the spot where the Facoma building stands at present) which the government rented.\n\nIn 1909, Canaman regained its status as an independent municipality, when it was separated from Nueva Caceres by an act of the First Philippine Legislature. This was mainly due to the efforts of Tomas Arejola, the representative of the first district of Ambos Camarines to the first legislature.\n\nOn March 8, 1942, three months after Japanese Imperial Forces landed in Legaspi and Naga City, the Tangcong Vaca Guerilla Unit (TVGU) was organized in Barangay San Nicolas, with Juan Miranda as the Commanding Officer, Leon Aureus as the Executive Officer and Elias Madrid as the Finance Officer. Among the numerous taga-Canaman who joined-up soon afterwards either in the unit’s intelligence or combat components were Jose and Antonio Madrid, Mamerto Sibulo, Andres Fortaleza, Marcos Severo, Damaso Avenilla, Federico Crescini, Nicolas Vargas, Venancio Begino, Eugenio Ragodon, Juan Pachica, Santiago Amaro, Jose Gervas, Pedro Angeles, Aproniano Lopez, Andres Alzate, Modesto Sanchez, Blas Alcantara, Andres Aguilar, Florencio Frondozo, Alfredo de la Torre and Flaviano Estrada.\n\nIn April 1945, Canaman was liberated by the 5th, 52nd, 53rd, 55th, 56th and 57th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Bicolano guerrilla resistance fighters of the Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit (TVGU).\n\nA landlocked municipality centrally located in the province of Camarines Sur, it is bounded on the north by Magarao, on the south by Gainza and Camaligan, on the east by Naga City, and on the south-west by the broad Bicol River. From north to south it is long, and wide from east to west.\n\nCanaman is politically subdivided into 24 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Canaman was people, with a density of .\n\nFarming, fishing, and small business are the primary sources of employment and household income.\n\nWhile most of the people's market activities are done in Naga City, Canaman has a public market and a privately owned \"talipapa\". Two agro-industrial establishments are found in Canaman: the poultry feeds and palay.\n\nVarious types of cottage industries like handicraft, furniture, fan making (made of anahaw), ragiwdiw and nipa shingles are conducted in this town.\n\nIn 1998, it was recorded that agricultural workers made up only 27.3% of the work force while 70.8% were engaged in non-agricultural activities. 88.38% of the total land area is devoted to agriculture.\n\nIn 2014, Canaman Dragon Boat Camp was launched in the village of Mangayawan along the Bicol River which serves as the turf of the Bicol River Hot Paddlers.\n\nEvery month of May, the community honors the Holy Cross through Lagaylay, a tradition which began over a century ago. For nine nights, women dance on the church or a chapel's square while chanting prayers to the Cross.\n\nMost of the roads and main streets in the poblacion (urban barangays) are concrete with few earth and gravel roads, 4 can be reached only through water transportation while 11 can be reached either through water transportation and/or by land transportation.\n\n"}

Fr. Oropesa penetrated the thick virgin forest of the Caramoan Peninsula and founded a small settlement in a place called Baluarte. This settlement was subsequently turned over to the administration of the Holy Bishopric in 1696.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Spaniards, it was determined that the place was once called Guta de Leche, which was given by Dutch traders who operated a gold mine in Lahuy Island and who frequented the area to trade with the natives. The name was perhaps derived from the milkdrop stalagmites found among the rocks of Guta Port. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the place came to be called \"Carahan\" for the sea turtle, which was at that time to be found in great number along the shores of the Peninsula.\n\nIn the , the population of Caramoan was people, with a density of .\n\nTourist destinations include the Caramoan National Park, the Centro, and Gota Beach, where activities include diving, swimming, snorkeling and spelunking.\n\nCaramoan has been the site for several editions of the competitive reality television show \"Survivor\".

Bulgarian Survivor also filmed its fourth season there in May to July 2009. \"Robinson 2010\", the 12th season of the Swedish version of the franchise, was filmed in Caramoan from May to June 2010. Finnish versions were filmed in there in 2018 with all-celebrity cast, and in 2019 half-famous and half- regular people cast.\n\nThe 8th season of \"Koh-Lanta\", the French edition of \"Survivor\", also was shot there. TV director Corinne Vaillant stated that \"the powdery sand, the coconuts on Gota beach and the neighboring islets are a 'dream' for the French people. We chose Caramoan because it’s really wild. It’s necessary that contestants don’t see anything other than nature for them to believe that they’re really lost in the wilds.”\n\nThe only season of \"Survivor India\" was shot in Caramoan, with an Indian production crew spotted in the area in March 2011.\n\nThe first season of \"\", a Romanian reality game based on Survivor was shot in Caramoan in the summer of 2016, as well as the first and second season of \"Robinsonův ostrov\" (Czech version).\n\nIn spring of 2016 the first season of the was filmed on 4 different islands, including Catanaguan and Tayak.\n\n"}

Furthermore, Goa’s distance from Manila via Daet, Camarines Norte, is about and via Quirino Highway is approximately .\n\nGoa is politically subdivided into 34 barangays, ten (10) of which are located within the poblacion/urban area and the remaining are considered rural barangays. The largest barangay is Hiwacloy having an area of and the farthest barangay is Tamban which is about from the poblacion area.\n\nThe town of Goa was originally situated at Barangay Salog which was then known as “Visita de Salog”, comprising the barrios of Lalud (now known as barangay Salog), Himagaan, Matacla, and Payatan. Lalud is found along the banks of Cagaycay River and is about five kilometers away from the present site of the town center.\n\nThe “visita” was established in 1701 by Franciscan Missionary Fr. Matias de Valdesoto and was attached to the parish of Manguiring, Calabanga. By 1729, it was declared independent and was later converted into a pueblo. The settlement center was later transferred to the present site because a disastrous flood swept the houses down the river and the inhabitants needed more land for planting. The original settlers found in the new site a wide stretch of plain land with brooks and rivers. There were scattered areas of swampland where \"'gajo\", a native slender cane plant the locals used for arrow shafts, grow in wild profusion.\n\nIn 1777, Franciscan Friar Fr. Juan Abalay, from the Portuguese colony of Goa, came to administer the parish. It was on his arrival that the village was converted into a town with the official name of Pueblo de Goa. Fr. Abalay was instrumental in naming the town Goa, motivated presumably for two reasons: to perpetuate the memory of his birthplace and to give official confirmation to the name which the place has been known for some time corrupted allegedly by the Spaniards from “\"gajo\"”.\n\nOn arrival, Fr. Abalay found Gregorio de los Reyes as Pueblo Headman and Santiago Evangelista, Juan de los Santos, Pedro Paraiso, Francisco Jacinto, Andres de la Trinidad and Lucas Delfin as council members. Fr. Abalay named Pedro de los Reyes son of the reigning Headman, “Cabeza de Barangay” in the cabeseria De Barangay del Pueblo De Goa. The German traveler, Feodor Jagor, found Goa a thriving municipality in 1863 when he scouted for guides who could accompany him climb Mount Isarog. In about the same year, the parish started the gigantic project of building a stone church and convent. The church, of Roman Gothic design and the convent, half stone and half wood, were completed in 1887. It took almost two decades of hard labor and involved every man, woman and child who was old enough to carry a piece of stone (known as cellar) to finish the project. A school building of stone was constructed soon across the street on the right side of the convent, to house the classes of the “\"primera enseñanza\"”. Another structure of the \"segunda enseñanza\" was added about the time the Revolution broke out in 1896.\n\nFor the duration of the revolution and until the arrival of the Americans in 1900, Goa was governed by a local detachment of the revolutionary forces. The inhabitants called this period “\"Gobierno Filipino\"”. They elected the first “\"presidente\"” upon the implementation of the Maura Law. Jose Perfecto, headed the civil authorities with the “\"Cabezas de Barangay\"”, the past “\"Capitanes Municipales\"” serving as the local town council.\n\nLaureano Pan was the first to serve as the local executive (1901-1903) in Goa during the American occupation. The establishment of the first American school was hastened by the unexpected capture of “Commandante” Faustino Perfecto, in-charge of a contingent of KKK troops stationed at Panagan River, by the American troops on the road to Naga. The American school opened in 1902 with Samuel D. Broadley as the supervising teacher. The first three American teachers were Stickney, Cappage, and Tabor, a colored American. Evidently, the Americans realized as early as then, the strategic location and prominence of the town in Partido area. From 1904 up to the end of the decade, Goa was one of only four places in Ambos Camarines with intermediate classes up to grade seven. The others were Nueva Caceres (Naga City), Daet and Iriga. The national road connecting Goa to Naga via Anayan was constructed in 1917. It was also in 1917 when the construction of the Municipal Hall was started which was completed in 1922. With the first automobile that traveled the Naga-Partido road, modernization slowly flowed in. In 1925, Jose Centenera, installed the first electric generator that lighted the town until the Japanese occupation. In the same year, he also opened a movie house, which featured serialized silent movies. In 1926, Goa had a modern concrete market pavilion and abattoir to replace the old market building.\n\nThe traditional Open Market day on Sunday, was initiated in 1945, though this is no longer true today since as the trade & commercial center in the 3rd District of Camarines Sur, everyday is already a market day. It was also in 1946 that Goa donated parcels of land to the Province of Camarines Sur for the establishment of Partido High School (converted to Partido National High School, then to Partido State College and now as Partido State University). Telecommunication service by telegraph was provided in 1950. The Goa Civic Square, an open park surrounded by huge acacia trees where the locals of Goa held almost all public activities – from amateur singing contest to political fora, benefit dances, fiesta celebrations, summer basketball competitions, etc., was constructed between 1952-1954. Next was the construction of the ABC Building between 1968-1971 under ABC President Alberto A. Din. The Camp Jovi Fuentebella in Lamon became the National Jamboree site in 1983. There was a trend of constructing covered basketball courts in majority of the municipalities in the country in the early nineties. By 1993, the Goa Civic Square was converted to become the covered Goa Sports Complex that now exists in front of the Goa Municipal Hall.\n\nIn the , the population of Goa, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nWhile the population of Partido District grew at irregular paces during the decade, Goa has consistently to be the second most highly populated in the district next to Tinambac. In year 2000, the municipality has a population of 48,490 with a 14% share to the district’s total population of 341,487. Meanwhile, Tinambac has the highest share of 15% to the district’s population which is only a percent higher than of Goa.\n\nIn 1995, Partido reached its highest growth rate of 2.58% but it dropped to 1.46% in year 2000. But Goa, on the other hand, showed a consistent average growth rate of 0.96% in 1990, 1.51% in 1995 and the highest rate of 2.50% in 2000. During the 2007 census, the municipality’s population ballooned to 54,035.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the Isarog Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 5 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.\n\nGoa is accessible from Naga City through a one and half-hour drive along the Fuentebella Highway. Two bus companies including air conditioned vans and jeepneys regularly ply the route to Goa. Jeepneys and trimobiles that convey people and products to and from the poblacion provide access to interior barangays.\n\nAll barangays are accessible through regular transportation services. Goa's road system spans a network interconnecting the various barangays in the municipality. Presently, it has of barangay roads, of national roads, of provincial roads and of municipal roads. Majority of the roads however, are gravel roads () particularly those at the barangay level. Meanwhile, 96.91% of the municipal roads are concreted. There are 38 bridges in the municipality with a total length of 435.60 meters. Of which, 74.52% were constructed by the DPWH, 14% by PEO, 9.64% by LGU and 1.84 by barangay administration.\n\nElectricity in Goa is provided by the local electric cooperative (CASURECO IV). In 2001, a total of 7,702 households are connected to the power cooperative energizing the 34 barangays of the municipality, however there still 2,316 households in the rural areas that are dependent on kerosene for lighting purposes\n\nGoa's environment sector revolves on two aspects: the forest environment and the urban environment. The protection of the forest environment is presently being handled by the DENR through the Office of the Protected Area Superintendent for Mt. Isarog National Park. The LGU, together with NGO representatives, is a member of the Protected Area Management Board. Such representation ensures Goa's participation in the protection of its portion in Mount Isarog. The urban environment protection is covered by the municipality’s Ecological Waste Management Program (EWAMP) which deals mainly in aspects of solid waste management, pollution control and monitoring of toxic emissions from industries. The EWAMP is equipped with heavy equipment transport utilities which regularly collect solid waste in commercial areas and urban barangays. The collected garbage is being dumped in a 16-hectare controlled dump site in San Isidro West located 11 kilometers away from the town proper.\n\nHospitals:\n\nThis municipality has different secondary and tertiary schools accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, the Department of Education, and the Department of Science and Technology.\nThe town of Goa is also the home of the premier high school in the whole Bicol region, the Philippine Science High School Bicol Region Campus at Barangay Tagontong. PSHS-BRC is one of the campuses of the PSHS system.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located about south-east of Manila, and about south of Naga City.\n\nAccording to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBarely half a century after Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines on March 16, 1521, Iriga, now a city, was only a visita of Nabua, Provincia de Ambos Camarines. Because of the disastrous floods that occur during rainy seasons in suburban Poblacion of Nabua, Father Felix de Huertas, the then parish priest, advised the farmers to move to I-raga (donde hay tierra or where there is land) where they can plant their crops without fear of being flooded. The flood victims of Nabua who moved earlier and followed the suggestions of their parish priest were the fortunate beneficiaries of the harvest of their agricultural plantation coming from the rich and fertile soils of I-raga, more so, those who planted at the foot of Sumagang Mountain (Mountain of the Rising Sun, now Mt. Iriga) said to be nature's given symbol of the Irigueños lofty ideals and noble visions.\n\nAs population spread out and evangelization progressed, the settlement at the foot of Sumagang Mountain developed in size and wealth, slowly pushing the aborigines (Agta) up to the thickness of the forest. And in 1578 the I-raga settlement was established as “visita” of Nabua under Fray Pablo de Jesus and Fray Bartolome Ruiz, both Franciscans. Three decades later or on January 4, 1641, Mount Asog (named after a negrito chieftain who ruled the aborigines) or Mt. Iriga, erupted. That eruption brought much fear to the settlers but with their strong faith and belief a miracle happened and as witnessed by local folks, the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mother and her son Lord Jesus or “Nuestra Señora de Angustia” at sitio Inorogan saved the people from terrible earthquake and flood. The eruption formed the cavernous gully on the side of Buhi leading to the steep gorge which was the crater of the “volcano”.\n\nIriga, according to Fray Felix Huertas in his lengthily-titled Estado Geografico, Topografico, Estadisticdo, Historico-Reliogoso de la Santa Apostolica Provincia de S. Gregorio Magno published in 1865, came from the native word iraga, which means “poseedores de mucho terreno,” or “possessors of much land.” From a mere “doctrina,” a religious administrative word which roughly means a “mission post” in 1583. In 1683, this progressive visita of I-raga was converted into Pueblo de la Provincia de Ambos Camarines with a population of 8,908 which several decades later the name I-raga was changed to Iriga by the Spanish authorities and advocated St. Anthony of Padua as Patron Saint and June 13 as the annual fiesta.\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century until the first two decades of the 20th century, Iriga was a major abaca-producing town in the Bicol region, largely because of the rich volcanic soil surrounding Mt. Iriga which it spewed in its last eruption about six hundred years before the coming of the Spaniards in Bikol. According to William Freer, the American Superintendent of Schools in Camarines Sur, “The sides of the mountain nourish rich plantations of abaca owned by several Spaniards, and shelter several hundreds of the Philippine aborigines, the Negritos, who are now employed on the plantations. Because of the production of abaca the town of Iriga ranks third in importance in Camarines, being outclassed only by Nueva Caceres and Daet.”\n\nDuring the incumbency of Don Martin Mendoza as Capitan Municipal, in the memorias de la Provincia de Ambos Camarines, showed that the “Pueblo de Iriga” was composed of “barrios y visitas distinguida la poblacion centro del casco en 5 barrios que son San Roque, San Francisco de Asis, San Juan Bautista, Santo Domingo de Guzman y San Miguel Arcangel con 6 visitas fuera del casco denominados San Nicolas de Tolentino, San Agustin, San Antonio Abad, Santo Niño, Santiago de Galicia y la visita de los monteses” with a population of 13,813. There were only four roads mentioned, they were coming from Nabua going to Baao, to Buhi and to Polangui, Albay, now the diversion road passing Salvacion, Masoli, Bato, then to the south road going to Polangui, Albay and there was only one way going to Nueva Caceres (Naga) via Bicol River by boat.\n\nIn 1913, the Manila Railroad (MRR) Company Station and the public market were established in their respective present site which readily contributed to the rapid growth of Iriga making it the center of trade and commerce in Rinconada area. It was also at this time that Mondays and Thursdays were declared as market days in Iriga. The Municipality of Iriga continued to prosper through the years. The original “barrios y visitas” have developed sitios which later on, these sitios have metamorphosed into distinct and separate barrios. After the Second World War, San Ramon, San Rafael, Cristo Rey, Santa Isabel, San Vicente Norte, San Andres, Santa Teresita, Perpetual Help, Sagrada, Niño Jesus, San Pedro and Antipolo, former sitios of barrio San Agustin, San Isidro and San Nicolas were created as barrios. And, the barrios of La Anunciacion and Santa Elena were sitios of Santo Domingo and Santiago, Del Rosario (Banao) of Santiago and Santo Niño and La Purisima of San Francisco & part of Santo Domingo, Santa Cruz Sur of San Francisco. Francia and San Jose from San Miguel and San Vicente Sur, Salvacion, La Trinidad and La Medalla from the large barrio of San Antonio. Some of these barrios were already created during the incumbency of Mayor Jose C. Villanueva in 1960. And the latest and the 36th barrio ever created was Santa Maria which comprises the sitios of Tubigan, Katungdulan, Bagacay, Sampaga, Rao and Cawayan of barrio Santa Teresita by virtue of Republic Act 6228.\n\nThrough the unflinching support and willful cooperation of the town's people, Mayor Jose C. Villanueva at the helm of stewardship successfully gained the conversion of Iriga into the signing of R.A 5261 otherwise known as the Charter of Iriga City on July 8, 1968. The City, however, was formally organized and inaugurated as the third city of Bicol on September 3, 1968 by Presidential Proclamation and officiated by the President of the Philippines. Since then, Iriga City has developed tremendously making it not only as the center of trade and commerce in Rinconada area but the whole Bicol Region as well, as it is strategically located in between the cities of Naga and Legaspi. In 2004, Madelaine Alfelor-Gazmen, the daughter of the late Camarines Sur congressman, Ciriaco R. Alfelor and granddaughter of Camarines Sur Governor Felix O. Alfelor, became Iriga's first woman city mayor, and only the third city mayor after his uncle, Emmanuel R. Alfelor was similarly elected in 1994 and served the city for 3 consecutive terms (1994-2004). On May 9, 2016, Iriga produced its first and only senator of the Republic through the successful ascension of senator and human rights defender Leila de Lima in the Philippine Senate.\n\nCAPITAN MUNICIPAL\n(1898-1899)\n\nPRESIDENTE MUNICIPAL\n(1899-1900)\n(1923-1928)\n(1929-1937)\n\nMUNICIPAL MAYORS\n(1938-1940)\n(1948-1951)\n(1952-1955)\n(1956-1959)\n(1960-1967)\n\nCITY MAYORS\n(1968-1980; March 1, 1988 – June 30, 1995)\n(OIC - April 1980-Nov. 1986)\n(OIC - Dec. 1986-Nov. 1987)\n(OIC - Dec. 1987-March 1988)\n(July 1, 1995 – June 30, 2004)\n(July 1, 2004 – June 30, 2013; July 1, 2016 – present)\n(July 1, 2013 – June 30, 2016)\n\nIriga is bounded by the town of Buhi in the east, by the municipalities of Baao, Nabua and Bato in the west, by the province of Albay in the south, and by the municipalities of Ocampo and Sangay in the north.\n\nIriga City is politically subdivided into 36 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Iriga, was people, with a density of .\n\nIrigueños or people of Iriga speak Rinconada Bikol language. Irigueños of Austronesian lineage are using Iriga variant while the indigenous and oboriginal groups of Agta or Negritos are using Agta variant of the language. Tagalog/Filipino and English languages are also understood and spoken. Bikol Central is also commonly understood and spoken in the Rinconada area.\n\nThe majority of the city residents are Roman Catholic. The Archdiocese of Nueva Caceres has several parishes and churches in the city. The biggest church can be found at the center of the city (Saint Anthony of Padua) and the Lourdes grotto symbolizes the long history of Catholicism in Iriga. Tinagba, a harvest festival can be seen a fusion of folk tradition and Catholic saint celebration.\n\nIglesia ni Cristo is the largest minority religion in the city. The INC's district office of ecclesiastical district of Camarines Southeast (CSE) is located in Barangay San Nicolas. The office oversees the church members in Rinconada and Partido areas in Camarines Sur, and Burias island in Masbate. Thus, a large number of INC members can be found in the city. At present, Iglesia Ni Cristo has four local congregations and two extensions in Iriga.\n\nIslam is a new religion in the city and most of its members are immigrants from Mindanao island. LDS Church members are also numerous, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses. Baptist adherents are also active in the city.\n\nIriga City Public Market is one of the busiest in the region which makes the city as the center of commerce in Rinconada district. The old Public Market was redesigned and reconstructed in 2010 and now hosts LCC supermarket, many local shops and several national chain restaurants. Sold at the new public market are locally grown and harvested organic produce such as tilapia harvested from nearby Lake Buhi and Lake Bato. Salt water fresh and dried fish from neighboring Balatan coast are sold in abundance in the market. Gift shops offering locally manufactured products made from local hemp, pili nut, bamboo and coconut are offered to local and foreign tourists.\n\nThe city is home to three major commercial complexes namely the LCC Mall Iriga, which was the second LCC Mall in the district, the UNP Town Mall near the University of Northeastern Philippines, Regent Central Commercial Complex and the newly built Gaisano Capital Iriga. National chain restaurants like Mang Inasal, Chowking, Jollibee, Biggs and Shakey's opened branches in the city. Many other fastfood and specialty restaurants are planning to open branches in the future including KFC and 1st Colonial Grill, that are planned to open at around 2019 at the Gaisano Capital Iriga . A new convention center was built in front of the Catholic Grotto hosts important events in the city.\n\nFound at the downtown Iriga is the City Park which is located near the cathedral and across the old City Hall. It is a well landscaped, Japanese-themed park with a huge spurting fountain at the center but was later replaced with a skating rink. Acacia trees are lit with colored lights during Christmas season. Surrounding the park are business establishments and landmarks such as the Lourdes Grotto which offers a great view of the downtown.\n\nThere is a number of waterfalls and springs found in the city. Several resorts and hotels were built to accommodate growing tourist arrivals. The old Ibalon Hotel was renovated and renamed as Iriga City Plaza Hotel. Local cuisine offering meat and vegetarian dishes with coconut milk and red chili peppers.\n\nA small central bus terminal was constructed in the city center to accommodate buses, shuttles and jeepneys going to Manila and neighboring cities. Philippine National Railways and Philippine Transportation Company (PHILTRANCO) maintain stations in Iriga City. Several hospitals operate in the city. A catholic-convent run Santa Maria Josefa Hospital is well- equipped and among the best in the region.\n\nElectrification of far villages in the mountain and river districts was completed and now, the city is 100% electrified.\n\nIriga City is served with several nationally operating telecom companies namely Digitel, Bayantel, PLDT, Smart, Globe and Sun cellular which offer telephone and internet services. These companies maintain major operations in the city. Iriga City is also the regional base of operations of TV and radio network RPN (Radio Philippines Network) Channel 9. Since 1968, its radio station RPN DZKI-AM (Radyo Ronda Iriga) and television station RPN DWKI-TV 10 (currently airing CNN Philippines) which has been operating from the city has dominated the airwaves. There are a few local cable TV operators that dominate the cable TV market, including GMA TV 13 Iriga (affiliated to DZAL of Rinconada Broadcasting Corp.) ABS-CBN Corporation has proposed to construct a relay station in the city, probably on a UHF Channel, while TV5 planned to set up a 10 KW UHF relay station here. DZIJ-RJTV Channel 21 is set to open in the city.\n\nThe city is home to two universities, several colleges and trade schools. The University of Saint Anthony, University of Northeastern Philippines, La Consolacion College, STI College, AMA Computer Learning Center and many others are located right within the city proper.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThere are two version as how Lagonoy got its name. Year 1734 when the first Spaniards in this place found a small forested area near a creek where \"hagonoy\", a medicinal plant grew abundantly. Because the Spaniards could hardly pronounce the word \"hagonoy\" with the \"j\" sound, with \"ha\" of the first syllable, they deliberately decided to change \"ha\" to \"la\". Since then, the place was known as \"Lagonoy\". Some of the residents also believed that the name was taken from the word \"\"lango\"\" meaning drunk. During fiestas and other forms or merry making, men used to drink too much \"tuba\" (native wine) that they become drunk or \"lango\" (Bikol for drunk) so that the place was called by the neighboring towns as \"Lagonoy\".\n\nIn 1734, Partido towns of Caramoan, Lagonoy, Goa and Tigaon belonged to Albay. It was only in 1846 did Lagonoy belong to Camarines Sur. In a long research by Norman Owen, a feud between Lagonoy Parish and Franciscan Mission of Goa and Tigaon existed. In 1580, the administration by the Franciscans of Lagonoy Parish began until 1636, which was passed to the “mitre” of the bishop of Nueva Caceres. In 1580 to 1850, Lagonoy gulf had been very famous because of the constant moro raids in the Partido area and all coastal towns of Albay and Catanduanes. On the other hand, Lagonoy had other problems about the Remontados of Mt Isarog. F. Mallari, in his book- “Ibalon under siege and storm” said they were fallen Christians and confirmed by Fray Manuel Crespo, who spent many years inducing them to return to the town and live peacefully. Fray Matias de Valdesoto also noted in his visits to the sitios of Goa and Lagonoy that the natives planted corn, rice, root crops & tobacco.\n\nLagonoy is politically subdivided into 38 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nLagonoy is the chief supplier of \"tiger grass\" to the prominent \"walis tambo makers\" of North Luzon and some parts of Central Luzon.\n\n"}
{"id": "2138881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138881", "title": "Libmanan", "text": "Libmanan\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. The town is home to the Morales Ruins, a 1937 architectural Art Deco masterpiece in the heart of the historic town. The Art Deco building is reportedly designed by a Filipino national artist.\n\nLibmanan was a bario of Quipayo in 1580 with the name of \"Piglabanan\". Records from a historian revealed that the municipality was named Libmanan on September 15, 1574. Missionaries started working in Libmanan in 1589 and the area's church was dedicated to St. James the Apostle. Several local stories hint as to the origin of the town’s name. One was that “\"ligmanan\"” means \"a place surrounded with waterways\". Another was Libangan since visitors forgot their former homes because they were said to be “\"na libang\"” or \"enjoying themselves\" - Libangan can also translate to \"place of enjoyment\". Another version was associated with the conditions during years of moro raids where area was called “\"Linabanan\"”, a battle ground. In the Old Spanish Records, Fray Paschual dela Cruz, writes the name of the town as \"Libñanan\" the Spanish way of pronouncing the word. The same Record also show that in 1823, Fray Francisco Valverde wrote it as \"Libmanan\" because it was easier to write and pronounce as well.\n\nGerman ethnographer Fedor Jagor described visiting Libmanan in his 1875 work \"Travels in the Philippines\", wherein he visited the local parish priest and learned from him about an ancient human settlement that had been dug up in 1851 during road construction in the Poro area of the southwest close near the Tres Marias islands: the excavation consisted of \"numerous remains of the early inhabitants—skulls, ribs, bones of men and animals, a child’s thighbone inserted in a spiral of brass wire, several stags’ horns, beautifully-formed dishes and vessels, some of them painted, probably of Chinese origin; striped bracelets, of a soft, gypseous, copper-red rock, gleaming as if they were varnished; small copper knives, but no iron utensils; and several broad flat stones bored through the middle; besides a wedge of petrified wood, embedded in a cleft branch of a tree.\" \n\nDuring the occupation of their country by the United States, the Philippine Legislature greatly expanded the network of railroads throughout the island of Luzon, and a railway headed to the city of Legazpi, Albay and Naga, Camarines Sur was built through Libmanan to provide direct access to those cities. This railway was damaged severely during World War II, but partially restored using American funds thereafter, providing transportation service down the Bicol Peninsula off and on until ending in 2012 despite plans to rehabilitate the route. The historical Morales Ruins Art Deco masterpiece at the heart of the heritage town was built in 1937.\n\nEven during the time of the Spaniards, the town of Libmanan was already considered the \"rice basket\" of the province. This generous production of rice is attributed to the fertile soil and the town's abundant water supply. In 1991 the area's irrigation canals (shared with its northern neighbor Cabusao, Camarines Sur) were sufficient to water 2996 hectares of land during the dry season.\n\n\nLibmanan is a large municipality, one of the biggest in Camarines Sur. It stretched across nearly the whole width of the Bicol peninsula, from where it borders Cabusao Municipality on the San Miguel Bay all the way out to the Ragay Gulf, including three islands known locally as the 'tres Marias', including one island known as 'puro island'. The main town, or 'poblacion', is located along the Libmanan River on the lowland alluvial plain adjacent to Cabusao.\n\nHeading to the southern coast from the poblacion the municipality becomes hilly. In this hilly region between the poblacion and the highway lies the Libmanan Caves National Park. Continuing on towards the coast from the hills, the municipality becomes truly mountainous beginning in Barangay Malinao beyond the Pan-Philippine Highway, where the \"Boro-Boro Spring Resort\" is located; a series of waterfalls that are a locally popular swimming destination. Beyond Malinao the upland region features the mountain 'Tancong Vaca' - in the local dialect meaning 'the cow's hump' - which is a local landmark visible from most locations on the Pan-Philippine Highway in western Camarines Sur and was a base of operations for local guerrillas fighting the Japanese during World War II. Up to the present day, the area around Tancong Vaca has remained an area of conflict between anti-government insurgents and the Philippine National Police.\n\nThe municipality's rural barangays lie behind Mount Tancong Vaca, and mostly lack access to paved roads, of which there is only one which terminates in the fishing village of Barangay Bahao, within sight of the tres Marias.\n\nLibmanan is politically subdivided into 75 barangays; five of which are located in the coastal areas and the remaining 70 barangays are distributed in the low land and upland portions of the municipality. Its town center, poblacion or centro, is away from the National Highway. The road leading to Poblacion and other major baranggays is marked by a memorial for the Ten Outstanding Young Men trophy awarded to a past mayor and local hero, Jose Bulaong.\n\nThe religious needs of its people and those of neighboring towns prompted the erection of the Prelature of Libmanan in 1990 and installation the first bishop, Msgr. Prospero N. Arellano . On 25 March 2009 Pope Benedict XVI elevated the prelature to become a diocese with Bishop Jose Rojas Rojas becoming its first bishop.\n\nThe Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines lists the following Catholic church parishes of Libmanan:\n\nLibmanan, one of the largest and most populous municipality in the province, benefits from the transportation being offered by the Libmanan River, the railroad and the national highway. Though rail service through Libmanan no longer connects directly to Manila there are still commuter trips available bringing passengers to nearby Naga, Camarines Sur and the route that was reopened in 2015 bringing them all the way to Legazpi, Albay.\n\nGenerally, Libmanan soil is adapted for growing different agricultural products. Portions are also adopted to pottery-the making of which has been a local industry for centuries. Libmanan has been the “rice-basket” not only of the province but of Southern Luzon-even during the Spanish regime. In spite of problems encountered by rice farmers, Libmanan maintains its status of being the rice granary of the province. \n\nThe town possess one of the most important cultural examples of ancestral houses in western Camarines Sur. Among these architectural marvels are the 1920s municipal hall building with its arcade-embellished facade, the 1875 Dilanco House which is the oldest structure in the town and was home to three former municipal mayors, the 1937 Morales Ruins which is the most culturally-important Art Deco building in the town, the Nacieno House which is another Art Deco ancestral house, and the 1926 Jaucian House (Built by Andres or Jose Jaucian Sr). Most heritage houses in the town have already been abandoned, including the Morales Ruins, Nacieno House, and the Dilanco House. In 2013, a campaign was administered by some locals to transform the Morales Ruins into a municipal museum, along with other heritage houses in the town to spur a heritage-based tourism industry and to conserve the remaining immovable cultural heritage of the town.\n\nThe Department of Education (Philippines) lists the following schools for Libmanan:\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nMilaor is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. Just like most cities in the Philippines, Milaor has a barangay system which is the core Local Government of the Philippines. Each barangay is headed by a chairman and barangay councils who were elected into office by popular vote of the community registered voters every three years.\n\nThe work of evangelization in Milaor began in 1579 when the Franciscan missionaries came to the Philippines upon the order of Pope Sixtus V and King Philip II, and given specific assignment to work in Bicol Region. In 1585, Milaor was declared a parish under the titular patron, Saint Joseph. The first parish administrator was Fray Matias de Andrade, OFM., who arrived in Bikol in 1582 and later became the fifth Bishop of the Diocese of Nueva Caceres.\n\nThe Franciscans, Fray Juan del Sacramento and Fray Jose dela Virgen, initiated the construction of a church made of bricks and stones. This was built in a place known today as \"Sinimbahanan\" now a part of Cabusao, where ruins of the concrete foundation may still be found. Frequent attacks from the cimarrones and the tulisanes from nearby Mount Isarog, however, caused the transfer of the church to its present site. Fray Santiago de San Pedro de Alcantara completed the construction in 1730 and added a convent made of wooden materials in 1735. Both the church and the convent were destroyed by fire in 1740 and immediately the reconstruction was undertaken by Fray Francisco delos Santos, OFM. The present belfry was finished in 1840.\n\nMilaor was formerly called \"Milaud\" or \"may-laud\". \"Laud\" means a lowland prone to being flooded, in fact that is being true up to this day. The expression \"mapa-laud\" means to go to a place which is low or with water, in other words, to go to a \"laud\". From \"Milaud\" or \"Maylaud\" it was transferred to \"Milaor\". The truth of this matter of the place being always filled with water is corroborated by the fact that in many barangays are to be found shells which thrive on water. These shell fossils mean that in ancient time this place was really covered with water or is frequently flooded to allow these shells or mollusks to thrive in the place.\n\nOriginally, Milaor comprised Palestina and the present parishes of Minalabac, San Fernando and Gainza. Until the eve following the uprising Naga City on September 19, 1898 during the Philippine Revolution, the Franciscan considered Milaor as their favorite resting place and abode away from the adjacent rapidly developing settlement that is Naga City today.\n\nIn the , the population of Milaor, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nSt. Joseph the Worker is the titular patron saint of the Municipality.

The locus and focus of this dream of the Church is by clustering all the neighboring families. Each cluster is composed of 15-20 families.\n\nOn May 13, 1994, another parish within the municipality of Milaor was established.

Likewise, after the celebration of the mass the next morning, the ten tumatarok once again performed another ritual, this time a sacred dance, in the sanctuary of the Church.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nNabua is the mother town of Iriga City, Buhi, Bato, Balatan, Bula and Baao in Camarines Sur. Nabua has five districts: Antacudos, Binoyoan, Caobnan, Lupa and Sabang.\n\nNabua is home of the modern kuntaw, and jota rojana.\n\nThe Municipality of Nabua traces the historical origin of its name way back during the Spanish Colonization. It was said that in 1571, an Augustinian Friar named Fray Alonzo Gimenez reached one of the rancherias called \"Lupa\" which was then under Datu Panga from Borneo. The good friar found persons inside the said rancheria cutting coconuts. He was offered to partake the inside shoot of coconut which the natives called “boa.\" Immediately, Fray Alonzo tagged the place as “Nabua” pronounced with his Spanish Accent. From that time onward, this place become popularly known as \"Nabua.\"\n\nIn another version, a historian named Fray Felix Huerta claimed that the name came from the story that the original sitio of the town is in the shape a young coconut embryo which was surrounded by five rancherias named Lupa, Antacodos, Sabang, Caobnan, and Binoyoan. Other believed otherwise and said it was centrally located in the middle of said rancherias, thus closely resembling \"boa.\" For a time, the town was called “Nabobowa\" but years of long usage shortened and corrupted it to the present name.\n\nIn 1578, a group of Franciscan missionaries led by Fray Pablo de Jesus and Fray Bartolome Ruiz put up a church in Antacodos where they placed a big cross. These missionaries soon merged the villages of Lupa, Antacodos, Sabang, and Binoyoan into one place.\n\nIn a research mission to Spain funded by the municipality, it was learned that Nabua was officially established as a municipality on July 25, 1569.\n\nBased on the 1734 Murillo-Velarde map, one of the earliest cartographic maps of the Philippine archipelago, the town is identified as \"Nava\" - a Spanish name indicating a \"level piece of ground.\" This is probably the apt description of the place at that time, and until the present time, a flat terrain stretching from the shores of the lakes of Bato and Baao and nestled in the plains between Mt. Asog and the mountains of Bula and the then Pantao.\n\nThe municipality of Nabua ranges approximately 123.25–123.39° east longitude and 13.35–13.42° north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Baao and Bula; on the south by the municipality of Bato; on the east by Iriga City; and on the west by the municipality of Balatan. The municipality is an established growth center in the southeast part of Camarines Sur Province or the midsection of Bicol River Basin Area. Along the Legazpi-Iriga-Naga-Daet Growth Corridor or LINDGC, the municipality is located about 53 kilometers from Legazpi City which is the regional center of Bicol; 37.0 kilometers from Naga City which is a major urban center; 135 kilometers from Daet which is a secondary urban center; and only 2.0 kilometers from Iriga City which is a minor urban center.\n\nThe municipality of Nabua possesses a climate belonging to the 4th type wherein rainfalls are more or less evenly distributed throughout the years. Its rainfall is classified as Type B or humid which is characterized by rains well or evenly distributed throughout the year with at most three dry months. General wind direction prevailing the municipality is from northeast to southwest at an average velocity of eight knots.\n\nThe municipality has a dry, a cold, and a wet season. From June to November, the town experiences heavy rains. The cold season comes every December to February. Then, from March to May, the dry season commences.\n\nThe municipality of Nabua is one land mass containing a total land area of 8,854.4193 hectares. This total land area distributed among the 42 barangays, nine of which are considered as urban barangays, namely, San Antonio (Poblacion), San Esteban, San Francisco, San Juan, San Luis, San Isidro, San Miguel, San Nicolas, San Roque (Poblacion) and 33 are considered as rural barangays. Among the urban barangays, San Antonio (Poblacion) has the biggest land area of 234.1798 hectares while San Luis has the least land area of 2.1746 hectares. In the rural barangays, La Purisima has the largest land area as well as in the entire municipality of 428.1501 hectares while San Roque Madawon has the smallest land area of 76.3228 hectares.\n\nThe municipality of Nabua given its land mass is entirely classified as alienable and disposable lands. Previous land classification has its slight share of forestland but was absorbed by the adjacent municipality of Balatan which requires political solution.\n\nNabua has about 8,803.0600 hectares or 99.42% very low elevation or less than 100 meters elevation and remaining 51.3593 hectares or 0.58% of low elevation or between 100–300 meters elevation. Its slope covers about 7,927.3616 hectares or 89.53% which are level to nearly level (0-3%) while the remaining 927.0577 hectares or 10.47% are rolling to moderately steep (18-30%)\n\nAs the dominantly alluvial plain, the municipality of Nabua has the prevalent soil types classified as either clay loam or sandy loam having silty texture. These soil types are very favorable for agricultural usage.\n\nThe geological characteristics for Nabua consist of: Upper Pleistocene (Sandstone and shale), Pliocene Pleistocene (Volcanoclast alluvial fans), and Recent (Alluvium or rice terraces).\n\nThe natural drainage tributaries for Nabua consist of numerous creeks interconnected with the three major rivers namely: Bicol River, Waras River, and Barit River.\n\nNabua is politically subdivided into 42 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Nabua, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe municipality’s total population accounts for 4.3% of the total provincial population of Camarines Sur, ranking fifth behind much larger population sizes of Naga City, Iriga City, Libmanan and Pili.\n\nHistorically, the municipal population has experienced positive growth rate, beginning in Censal Year 1903 up to 1999. Municipal population records show only one exception in Censal Year 1970 where the municipal population decreased. This population shift in number can be attributed to migration patterns due to socio-economic reasons. Thus, from a mere population size of 18,893 in 1903, the current municipal population more than tripled in size for 1999.\n\nSpread out among the 42 barangays of Nabua, there are 10,093 persons living in the urban barangays while 65,329 persons live in the rural barangays. Among urban barangays, San Antonio Poblacion has the largest population with 2,363 persons while San Luis has the smallest with 358 persons. For rural barangays, La Purisima has the largest population with 8,165 persons while Salvacion Que Gatos has the lowest with a population of 523 persons.\n\nMany Nabueños are followers of Catholicism which is very apparent to the names of several barangays which bear the names of Catholic patron saints. However, culture, festivals and practices are of mixed Catholic and local beliefs of Bicolanos of pre-Spanish period. Iglesia ni Cristo on the other hand is the largest minority religion with several local congregations in the municipality and is growing rapidly.\n\nThe Nabua-Balatan variant under lowland dialect (sinaranəw) of Rinconada Bikol can be considered having its base from the Bikol languages. However, there are other smaller social groups within the Bicol region where Nabua derives the foundation of its variant. The Rinconada area composed of Baao, Buhi, Bula, Balatan, Bato, Nabua and Iriga shares the same Rinconada Bikol language that the local folks are still enriching up to this day. The Nabua-Balatan variant can be easily recognized by the way they enunciate words or phrases when they talk or use the language. For being the mother town of all the municipalities and city in Rinconada area, the Nabua-Balatan variant is considered by linguistics as one of the foundation variants of Rinconada Bikol language.\n\nAdditionally, Spanish influences are frequently encountered in the languages of Nabuenos. Some examples of Spanish words embedded in the local dialect are: “\"Abreyā raw iton puertan\".” This is a command statement, meaning “Open the door” in English or “Buksan ang pintuan” in the Filipino language. The word “abreyā” is an inflection of the Spanish verb “abrir” (to open), and “puertan” is a shorten word of \"puertāhan\" which is from the Spanish word “puerta”.\n\nOther variations of Spanish words being used in the Nabua-Balatan variant can be found, but many of these words or terms due to usage over time do not follow proper Spanish language conjugations and grammar.\n\nNabua has a rich array of customs and colorful practices that are found up to the present day.\n\nAgriculture contributes a major role to the economy of the municipality of Nabua given its vast alluvial plains. Its agricultural contribution consists of crop production, livestock, and fishery. Crop production is more intense rather than livestock and fishery.\n\nRice production, both irrigated and non-irrigated occupies about 87.26% of the total agricultural land devoted to crop production while corn and other types of crops occupies merely 7.96% and 4.78% respectively. However, crop production in the entire municipality represents only about 36.94% of the total municipal land area. Livestock production can be described as one merely that of backyard raising style despite the presence of at least two farms located at Inapatan with aggregate of only 1.00 hectare and only 22,000 animal heads. Likewise, inland fishing can hardly produce much-needed agricultural revenues both for the inland fishermen as well as for the benefit of the local government.\n\nThe Poblacion of the municipality of Nabua is strategic area for commercial development. Presently, its commercial area can be classified as a minor central business district which is reflective of being a tertiary urban growth corridor along the Legazpi-Iriga-Naga-Daet growth corridor. It services the commercial needs of the neighboring municipalities of Bato and Balatan secondary only to Iriga City. Among the commercial establishments to be found within the Poblacion are wholesale trade, general merchandise, auto and motor supplies, school supplies, funeral parlor, groceries, insurance companies, banks, lending investors, pawnshops, drugstores, restaurant and sari-sari stores.\n\nSeveral barangays outside of the Poblacion functions as neighborhood centers. Those rural barangays include Santo Domingo, Malawag, La Purisima, La Opinion, Dolorosa and San Jose. Most common in about 30 rural barangays are the mushrooming of sari-sari stores.\n\nThe municipality of Nabua remains predominantly agriculturally-related in terms of industrial activities at present. The existing industrial establishment within Nabua consists mainly of rice mills with total industrial of about 3,000 square meters. Cottage industries generating household employment and incoe proliferate in rural barangays. Nabua has a potential for agro-industrial development. This is manifested by its: (1) proximity to both Balatan Port and Pantao Port (2) Inherent vast agricultural lands (3) As an urban growth center and, (4) suitable agro-industrial site.\n\nThe municipality has Rural Health Units and hospitals nearby Poblacion area. Those are:\n\n\nTransportation is very much important in Nabua because of its strategic location and membership in the Legazpi-Iriga-Naga-Daet growth corridor; and it is the preferred development strategy of agro-industrial commerce and tourism.\n\nLand transportation available are the various road systems and the Philippine National Railways (PNR) track facilities traversing the municipalities. Generally, the municipality has adequate road lengths based on the standards of 1.5 km. per 100 hectares of arable land.\n\nThe strategic location of Nabua along the Luzon grid makes it an ample recipient of power supply from NAPOCOR. Within the municipality itself, the Camarines Sur Electric Cooperative (CASURECO) 3 as the exclusive provider retails supply of electricity. All barangays within the municipality are already energized both in urban and rural barangays.\n\nThere are three existing Level 3 water supply systems that provide potable water, namely: Nabua Water District, Duran Water System, and Sagumay Water System.\n\nExisting communication services and facilities includes cable television, telephone services, telegraph services and telegraphic transfer, cellphones, and postal services.\n\nThe only existing radio station in the municipality is DWEB FM 99.9 MHz of the Filipinas Broadcasting Company and the Bicol Media Network.\n\nThe town of Nabua is known for having a large contingent of active and retired United States Navy servicemen. That makes Nabua a veritable destination for tourists, retirees, and balikbayans from the United States. Oftentimes, coyly and with a tinge of amusement, the town is usually referred to as the \"Town of the Green Bucks (U.S. Dollars)\". Most of the families of these servicemen reside in Southern California, particularly in the San Diego area. During religious and special holidays, these U.S. based Nabueños plus a growing number of Nabua natives now residing in other parts of the world would unfailingly return to their beloved Nabua, tagging along their friends, and freely spending their hard-earned foreign currency which definitely boosts the local economy and tourism.\n\nNabua celebrates its fiesta with the now-famous annual Boa-Boahan Festival on the third of May. The highlight of the festival is the reenactment of the traditional \"Boa Feast,\" a 13th-century rite where ancient Bicolanos offered chains of coconut embryos called boa to their pagan deities, in the belief that this would give them ample harvests, favorable weather, and make their lives more prosperous and happy throughout the year. The feast is enlivened with frenzied street theater, heart-pounding street dances and spectacles, and a riveting display of colorful and dazzling ethnic costumes. This annual festival was initiated and given unprecedented impetus and funding by then Mayor Ulpiano Duran and the town's first lady then, Mrs. Delia Duran, in tandem with the late District Supervisor Mrs. Patricia Romano and the principals, teachers, and pupils from both public and private schools.\n\nThe first-ever festival was held in 1974, a street pageantry that was graced in the evening by a memorable dramatic revue performed by the legendary U.P. Mobile Theater under Professor and National Artist Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, with the help of the touring company's long-time national coordinator, Mr. Timothy O. Albano (incidentally, he and his staff volunteered to research extensively the legend and authentic lore behind the festival's underlying mythology).\n\nThe late U.S. Engr. Cleto Descalso, a Nabueño philanthropist who chose to retire in Nabua after the decades he spent working in the United States, generously funded the creation of the Descalso Garden Park near the Municipal Hall. This exquisitely-designed garden became the staging point for this first festival. A poetry-reading featured during the first Miss Boa-Boahan/Alinsangan beauty pageant was delivered by National Artist Mr. Riyoh Alma (Virgilio Almario). The guests of honor who helped crown the first Miss Boa-boahan Festival had included the commanding generals and commodores from both the Subic Bay Naval and Clark Air bases.\n\nThe over 400-year-old church of Nabua known as the Vicariate of the Holy Cross is a prominent landmark along the national diversion road connecting the municipality of Baao directly to this town without passing the city of Iriga.\n\nStarting from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, you will find 400-year-old religious customs and traditions being celebrated by the locals. Semana Santa starts with the Palm Sunday procession and blessing of Palms. On Holy Wednesday and Good Friday, the Processions of 'Pasos' are solemnly held to depict the Passion of the Christ. To commemorate Christ's resurrection, the \"Balo-balu\" is celebrated the night of Black Saturday and then the \"Ton-ton\" at dawn on Easter Sunday after the \"Salubong\" procession.\n\nExisting local industries such as bamboo craft, handloom weaving, woodcraft and basketry derived from available raw materials.\n\nNabua boasts of a high literacy rate of 96.54% within the municipality. The people of Nabua put a premium on higher education as their key to social and economic mobility. The present level of educational services within the municipality covers a number of teachers and classrooms vis-a-vis current and projected enrollments.\n\nFor elementary level, there are a total of 33 elementary schools divided into East and West Districts with a total current enrollment of 11,947 pupils. The secondary level of education is currently provided by Nabua National High School, La Purisima National High School, Malawag Nationalized High School, Santo Domingo Institute, and Saint Jude Agro-Industrial College.\n\nThe Polytechnic State University of Bicol, formerly known as Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges, is a public school located in San Miguel that offers tertiary, post-graduate, as well as short–term courses, technical or vocational in nature.\n\nNabua is the site of large state-run and private educational institutions in Rinconada. Some of the leading schools in Nabua are:\n\n\n"}

The place was named “Mabatobato” because of the presence of huge rocks scattered all over the place believed to have erupted from Mt. Isarog. As a mission, it has four barrios; Ayugan, Tinablanan, Pinit and Moriones.\n\nIn early 1800's, people from neighboring towns began to flock the area to settle and till the vast areas of lands suited for agriculture. The place began to flourish that the people began to dream of transforming the settlement into a new municipality. Cabeza de Barangay Michael Alcantara and Don Jose Barangbang requested and pleaded to the Bishop of Caceres to make the barrio into a town. The request was granted.\n\nIn 1917, Mabatobato was annexed to the municipality of Pili to help it recover from the Spanish–American War and for effective governance. By 1922 it was made into a new parish. Baptisms and burials were first recorded that year. The place began to flourish again and influx of immigrants from neighboring towns as well as from Batangas and Tayabas were observed.\n\nAfter three decades, the leaders and the people of Mabatobato began to clamor for independence and to govern themselves once again. In 1948, during the incumbency of Congressman Sebastian C. Moll, Jr., 2nd District Camarines Sur, the dream to separate had been brewed. President Elpidio Quirino signed Executive Order No. 243 dated 15 July 1949 entitled: “Organizing Certain Barrios of the Municipality of Pili, Camarines Sur, into an Independent Municipality under the name of OCAMPO”. Mabatobato was renamed in honor of Don Julian Ocampo who was the Governor of Camarines Sur in the 1930s. Upon the appointment and qualification of the first municipal officials, Ocampo has begun to officially exist as an independent municipality on August 10, 1949.\n\nOcampo is politically subdivided into 25 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Ocampo, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nPartido Dialect is the primary dialect spoken in the entire town.

Tagalog and English are also spoken and understood.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the \"Isarog Agta\" language which has an estimated speaker of 5 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.\n\nThe religious groups in the locality are: Roman Catholic, Seventh Day Adventist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Word International Ministries and other groups of Born-Again Christians.\n\nCommercial establishments include internet shops, bank, pawnshops, hardware stores, groceries, drug stores, eateries, computer shops, bakeries, motorcycle dealers, agri-dealers, gas stations and several ricemills. Various businesses are sprouting.\n\nLocal products include palay, corn, root crops, sugarcane, coconut, and vegetables.

There's also Tera Mater Resort, the first resort in the town, located in Barangay New Moriones and a newly opened resort in Barangay San Antonio.\n\nOcampo Deer Farm is situated at an elevated area about four kilometers up in the forests of Mt. Isarog, in Barangay Santa Cruz, the 28-hectare reindeer farm is considered as the original reindeer farm of the Philippines. It was stocked entirely with Australian species such as Blackbuck Antelope, Fallow Deer, Chital Deer, Red Deer and Elk.\n\nThe farm was started late in 1996 with only 208 heads of five species from Australia. As of today, the number remains at 220 heads. Its goal was to make the province a supplier of deer meat (venison) which is a delicacy in class restaurants while the hides can be used as material for bags belts and other goods, and the antlers can be extracted for medicinal value.\n\nPacific Santa's Inc., founded by Santa R-Kayma Klaws, is entering an exclusive management agreement with the provincial government to micro-manage and promote the farm.\n\nThe Bicol Strawberry Farm owned by the Libreja family is found in Barangay Pinit.\n\nThe town fiesta of Ocampo is celebrated in the month August in commemoration of the town's patron saint, Saint Bernard Abbot.

It first started as a settlement in Western area of the Bicol River, then it grew to become a Sitio called Patong. The name was changed to Pamplona by a Retired Spanish Military Officer who resided in the place and named it after his native city in Spain - Pamplona, capital of Basque, Province of Navarro.\n\nHistorical references concluded that most Spaniards inhabiting the place came from the province of Pamplona in Spain and thus decided to name their settlement also as \"Pamplona\".\n\nPamplona officially became a parish on May 8, 1885, which coincided with the date of the town's celebration honoring their patron saint, St. Michael Archangel.\n\nPamplona is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Pamplona, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nAs part of the Bicol Region, the municipality has a tropical climate favorable to agriculture. The fields remain lush-green throughout the year, even through a long drought period. Generally, there are only two distinct seasons, namely: dry and wet season. The dry season starts from about the middle or later part of January up to April and the wet season starts from May to December.\n\nFarming is considered to be the main source of livelihood and basically agriculture is the primary source where most households derive their income. The agricultural products includes coconuts, upland crops and rice. Agricultural workers outnumbering the ones who are employed in non-agricultural occupations. As of 1997, 66.2% are engaged in agricultural works while 33.8% make up the non-agricultural labor force.\n\nIndustries include cottage industries and bamboo furniture industry with agricultural equipment manufacturer found in Barangay San Gabriel, making portable hand tractors, palay treshers, and portable wind blowers.\n\nThe rehabilitation of farm-to-market roads was started to link the barangays to the trade and commerce industry. This will facilitate the transport of farm products and farm inputs.\n\nThe town has four barangay high school in San Vicente, San Isidro, Poblacion and Veneracion. It also has 11 barangay elementary school and two primary schools.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nPasacao is politically subdivided into 19 barangays.\n\nPasacao was the slumbering \"visita\" and served as the only existing port of the Bicol Region. The Spaniards who set foot in Bicol late in 16th century noted the importance of the visita in their exploration. Pasacao became a strategic defense port against the raids by Moro pirates from 1585 to 19th century. Due to frequent raids the town had an estimated population of only 200 in 1823.\n\nVessels carrying goods and passengers made their starts or stop over here. Notwithstanding the rough road to Pamplona, this town has been contributing to, a large degree, in the economic development of the province of the Camarines Sur in particular.\n\nPasacao's strategic location along the rugged coast of the vast expanse of the Ragay Gulf in the east made it very important to the economic and social life of the people of the region. It is for the reason that a parish was established dedicated to the Saint Rose of Lima as the patroness. Annually in the honor of the town patroness, a fiesta is celebrated on August 30.\n\nIt is said that the geography of Pasacao makes its history full of hardships, troubles and affliction that influenced the customs, traditions and way of life of the inhabitants. The continued Moro piracy likes that one in 4 October 1779 at Caranan. The report of Bishop Manuel dela Concepcion described these raids in his letter to the King on June 29, 1758 as \"undoubtedly greater at any other time.\" (Raids in 1757). The raids according to Domingo Abella-Bikol Annals, \"ten towns and two missions were completely destroyed; ten churches were looted and burned; about 8,000 indios were captured or killed; one priest was killed, two captured, and the capital Caceres, was under alert one night. Alcalde Jacinto Rodriguez Morales provided material for a baluarte (earthwork or fortified rampant) as defense of Pasacao against these raids. He also issued rations to bantayes (watchmen, sentinels).\n\nThe port of Pasacao is rich in stories on how it got its present name. Since the part is a bustling area, dockguards were stationed to maintain peace and order. These guards would usually shout \"Pasa ikaw, Pasa ikaw\" as instructions to passengers. This Spanish-Tagalog mixed up \"pasa-ikaw\" was mistaken by the passengers as the name of the place - Pasacao.\n\nAnother story went around that fisherman who was asked by a Spanish sentry what were the contents of his basket. The fisherman answered \"pasa-pasa\", the name of the fish, and simultaneously offered some by saying \"ikaw\" meaning to say if he wanted some. The sentry on the other hand interpreted the words \"Pasa-pasa ikaw\" as the name of the place. For long, the place was known among the soldiers as Pasa-pasa ikaw until it shortened to a more convenient Pasacao.\n\nThe town's name was also said to have been derived from \"Pasok kayo\". This came from a native as an answer to a Spanish soldier's query of the name of the place. Misunderstanding clouded the native's remark when he meant to say that the soldier come up or come in.\n\nIn a similar story as the first story, Pasacao came from \"Pasa ikaw\". Some Spanish settlers while walking along the shore met a native. The settlers asked the native to pass on by saying \"Pasa\". The native, on the other hand, wanted the Spaniards to go first by saying \"ikaw\". Through a convenient usage, it became Pasacao.\n\nStill another story gives credence to the word \"Pasangkay\" as the origin of the town's name. The travelers and traders often used it en route to Manila to ask owners of the sailboats along the shore of the village to let them ride. Pasangkay means the request of the people to get into the boat to travel.\n\nFrom the above-mentioned short atories, the name of the town Pasacao must have been derived from them.\n\nThe Fil-American or Spanish law recognizing the legal existence of Pasacao believes. Church records however say that the founding of the church was 1885.\n\nVery few people of Pasacao except the old during the governorship of Juan de Silva (1609–1626) two galleons (Manila-Acapulco trade) were constructed in the astillero at the Lupaon (or Dalupaon nowadays) Pasacao. They were Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe and the Angel dele Guardia. According to our BiKol historian Jose Calleja Reyes, the galleon \"Guadalupe\" figured both in the galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco and in the defense of the Philippines against Dutch incursion in the naval battle of Playa Honda.\n\nOther important historical events that unfolded the Pasacao still left them landmark. The Pasacao Pier was the dockyard of the Japanese ships when it was bombed. Until now some of the Japanese ships can be seen under clear waters. The first place where the AMerican landed is the Magtabid Beach in Pasacao. American air transportation first landed in Tinalmud with their Grasshoppers in 1945. The Pasacao seashore was the place where the Six Daughters of Charity (nuns) landed from Spain to establish the first normal school for girls which is now the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Naga City. These and many other events took place in this town.\n\nDuring the early American school administrators used this port as their landing. When going to manila they had to sail from here. With no roads from Naga City they used to be carried in the hammock by hired men traversing the mountain trails. In spite of the importance of Pasacao-Pamplona road the authorities have been slow improving it. It took three days on foot from Pasacao to Naga back and forth during the late 19th century.\n\nIn the , the population of Pasacao was people, with a density of .\n\nWhile Tagalog is the national language of the Philippines and English is common to the business sectors, these languages are rarely spoken as a medium of communication in Pasacao. Bicol Naga is the language or dialect being spoken by most of its people.\n\nThe municipality belongs to the fourth distinct type of climate. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year with north-east monsoon prevailing in the area. The general direction of the wind is characteristically from north to east from October to January and from east to southeast from February to April and easterly from May to September. The area is relatively dry from December to May and wet for the rest of the year.\n\nFrom February to May is hot and dry season in the Philippines and Pasacao in particular. From this months most visitors and tourists come to Pasacao to unwind. It is during the \"Lingo ng Pagkabuhay\" or the Easter Sunday that most resorts and beaches are fully loaded with visitors coming from nearby places and other areas of the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "2138906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138906", "title": "Pili, Camarines Sur", "text": "Pili, Camarines Sur\n\n', officially the ', (), Rinconada Bikol: \"Banwāan ka Pili\", ) is a and capital of the province of , .\n\nThe municipality was classified as 1st class in terms of income classification in 2007.\n\nThe first recorded history of Pili started during the promulgation of Christianity in the early 1770s by the Spanish missionaries, when the town houses the “Cimarrones” or the “Remontados” who resisted the foreign rule of the neighboring Hispanic city of Nueva Caceres. The early center of settlement in the town is located in \"Binanuaanan\" (from \"banwaan\" which means town) until missionaries transferred it to the present site of the town proper where the St. Raphael Archangel Church is located.\n\nThe Americans established the town of Pili in 1901. The name of the town has many disputed etymologies, either it came from the Bicol Region's Pili nut (Canarium ovatum) or from the Bicol word “pili” or “to choose”. The latter is because the Americans wanted to make the town as the new provincial urban center due to the fact that Naga City which the Spaniards had developed was prone to major floods. The town is also a very strategic location for the Americans. Pili connects the major districts of the province: the Bikol Naga-speaking towns of the North, Partido Area, and the Rinconada Area. It was here where they build the current Naga Airport and the Camarines Sur Agricultural School in 1918 which is now the main campus of the Central Bicol State University of Agriculture. The town of Pili was formally established in 1919 as a municipality.\n\nWhen the World War II broke out in 1941 the Japanese Imperial Army sent 3,000 soldiers to Pili due to the concentration of American developments in the town. They built tunnels, manmade caves, and foxholes all over the town which are still existent in the town today. The infrastructures of the war were mostly in the barangays of Cadlan, Curry, San Jose and even in the Centro area. When the Japanese started to lose, they flee to Mt. Isarog to hide. They created a lot of holes in Mt. Isarog and used the mountain as their last stand in the Bicol Region. In the present, the heroes of the war were remembered through Filipino-Japanese Friendship Historical Landmark in Sitio Bongcao, Curry at the foot of Mt. Isarog.\n\nWhen Naga City was declared as a chartered city, there is a need to search for the next provincial capital. Former Governor Juan F. Trivino chooses the Municipality of Pili as the new home of the Provincial Capitol. Finally on June 6, 1955, Pili was declared as the Provincial Capital by virtue of R.A. 1336 replacing Naga City. The new site for the provincial capitol was the 150 hectare lot donation of Don Susano Rodriguez in the barangay of Cadlan.\n\nPili is politically subdivided into 26 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Pili, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of . While the Centro district which consists of six (6) barangays has a total population of 12,104 according to the 2015 Census.\n\nThere are two Bicol languages used all over the municipality, Central Bicolano on the northern part, and Riŋkonāda or Rinconada Bikol on the south. However, Central Bicolano is the lingua franca, used all throughout the town for communication. Tagalog and English language are also widely understood.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the predominant religion in the municipality, where the town is under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Caceres in Naga City. It is followed by Born-Again Christian denominations, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.\n\nAside from the feast of every barangay and sitios, there are two major festivals being celebrated in the town. The municipal government hosts the religious-based town fiesta in the Centro district, while the provincial government has its own festival for its foundation.\n\nThe Pili Town Fiesta is for the celebration of the feast of St. Raphael the Archangel, the patron saint of Pili. It is celebrated annually every October 23–24 since the foundation of the parish in 1819. The name of the festival will depend on the administration of the municipality, which is either “Cimarrones Festival” or “Pinili Festival”. It is celebrated by the six (6) barangays of the Pili Centro District.\n\nThe Provincial Government of Camarines Sur celebrates the Kaogma Festival for the foundation of the province of Camarines Sur. It is held annually every last week of the month of May at the Camarines Sur Provincial Capitol Complex in Cadlan and Camarines Sur Freedom Sports Complex in San Jose.But in the year 2019 of the term of Miguel Luis \"Migz\" Reyes Villafuerte, he decided to have it held in Iriga City. It was dubbed as the  \"world's hottest festival.\"\n\nPili is the Bicolandia's Agro-Industrial Center, with its reputation as the Bicol region's burgeoning industrial town due to its giant warehouses and milling plants. Urbanization is very rapid in the town with its high population growth due to its continuous progress and development.\nPili has been the third largest commercial center in Camarines Sur and the 10th largest commercial center in the Bicol Region. Its commercial and business center is in its town proper, which the locals called 'Pili Centro'. It is the densest part of the town. The \"Daang Maharlika\" or the national road is the main road of the town proper, where it stretches from San Isidro to Santiago. Below is the list of barangays of the district with its population and some notes.\n\nMarkets in the district includes the Pili Public Market, SM Savemore Market, and the LCC Supermarket. Multiple department stores also made their way to the town.\n\nThe barangays of Cadlan and San Jose, located at the northern part of the town, are the center of developments and activities of the provincial government of Camarines Sur. It also has a high concentration of provincial government institutions in the province of Camarines Sur, aside from the provincial government offices in Naga City.\n\nThe town of Pili has a “plain and elevated” geography, thus is very ideal for agriculture. Majority of the farmlands are in the area between the Uptown and Downtown Area. Rice, sugarcanes, and corn are the primary products.\n\nAside from being Bicolandia's Agro-Industrial Center, Pili is also the regional center of agricultural administration in the Bicol Region. At the barangay of San Agustin, the Department of Agriculture - Regional Office, the Central Bicol Experiment Station, and the Agricultural Training Institute are located.\n\nOld agro-industrial zone\n\nThe old agro-industrial zone of the town is concentrated at the southwest portion of the town, and stretches along the Pili Diversion Road and south of the poblacion district (New San Roque, Anayan, etc.).\n\nThe Co Say and Company Inc. was the pioneer in the agro-industrial development of the town. It has an Oil Milling Plant which produces crude coconut oil at La Purisima near the Pili Diversion Road, and its former Rice Milling Plant at Tagbong. Now, the area also hosts the Partido Rice Mill, Bicol Biomass Energy Corporation (the first rice husk-fired power plant in Southern Luzon), B-Meg Plant - Southern Luzon Feedmill Inc. (SLFI), Penafrancia Sugar Mill (Pensumil), and giant warehouses of WL Foods Corporation, etc.\n\nSanta Rita Industrial Park\n\nThe Santa Rita Industrial Park, developed by the Santa Rita Ecozone Corporation, is located in Barangay San Jose and Sagurong. It has a land area of 219 hectares.\n\nIsarog Heights Special Economic Zone\n\nIt is a planned new economic zone in the town. It will be developed by the Manubay Agro-Industrial and Development Corporation with an estimated project cost of 799.26 million pesos. It has a land area of 124.3 hectares in the barangay of Cadlan, which has preferred industries in food processing and manufacturing.\n\nPili is now known for its giant warehouses and sale stores for cars and home furniture stretching along the Maharlika Highway in the barangay of San Jose, Cadlan, and Palestina. The developments are rapidly increasing since 2013.\n\nSan Jose houses the imposing car sales and service centers of Honda and Nissan, both conceded to be among the biggest in South Luzon. Foton, a China-based automaker, also open their own service center with Subaru Motors which is a near high-end car manufacturer. Home furniture sellers include the Uratex Foam, Union Galvasteel – Bicol Roll Forming Plant, FC Tile Center, and My Home Depot. The area also hosts the “Kakanon Bicol”, a restaurant for Bicol regions’ local delicacies. The barangay of Cadlan hosts the Toyota Camarines Sur, while Palestina hosts Mitsubishi and Isuzu.\n\nJust a neighboring town of Naga City, it is now the host of many housing developments ranging from middle to high class ones. Barangay Palestina is ideal for housing developments because it is the nearest barangay to the city. The advantage of Pili from the other neighboring towns of Naga City is its infrastructure developments like the Naga Airport and top tourist destinations like the Camarines Sur Watersports Complex. Housing developments in Palestina includes the Amaia Scapes, Lumina Homes, St. Paul Subdivision, Pamon Village, etc.\n\nAt the foot of the mountain, the highland area of Mt. Isarog includes the barangays of Tinangis, Curry, and Santo Nino. Landmarks in this area includes the Filipino-Japanese Friendship Monument declared as a in Sitio Boncao, Barangay Curry, White Cross at the entrance of Tinangis, and the \"Jose Velarde Race Track\" (Curry).\n\nThe Mt. Isarog National Park is not only known for its biodiversity and beauty; it is also famous for its clean and cold flowing water. The natural falls in Pili includes Tinagrawan Falls at Tinangis and the “Eight Waterfalls in One River of Sitio Boncao, Curry” which includes the Slide Falls and the Balang (Shower) Falls.\n\nOne natural waterfall which is visible from the downtown especially during rainy weather is the Maati Falls. It came from the Bicol word \"ati\" or \"loses a certain amount for a fluid\", because the falls was perceived to vanish during a sunny weather and appear again during a rainy weather. However, it was believed that reaching the Maati Falls is very difficult. \n\nAlso, multiple resorts in the area includes the Bongga Resort (Curry) and the Rokbee Resort (Tinangis). Mt. Isarog now serves as the source of drinking water throughout the town of Pili via the Pili Water District.\n\nPili is the site of Naga Airport.\n\nThe town is not coastal and thus depends mainly on land transportation. Major local transportation are either jeepneys or buses. Some barangays use motorcycles (habal-habal). The Philippine National Railways have a night train service from Manila called Mayon Limited. It arrives at Pili railway station at 5:58/5:59AM local time.\n\nWater supplied by the established water system under the Pili Water District (PIWAD), which has a water source from Mt. Isarog. Power and electricity is supplied by the Camarines Sur Electric Cooperative II (CASURECO II).\n\nThere are two major “school belts” in the town: the \"San Jose\" (in the North) and the \"Pili Centro\" (in the South). The barangay of San Jose, which is considered as the provincial education hub, has the highest density in terms of number of learning institutions among the barangays in the town which is comparable to the whole of Centro district.\n\nThe “San Jose Belt” stretches along the Maharlika Highway from San Jose North Elementary School to San Jose South Elementary School. While, the “Pili Poblacion Belt” stretches also along the Maharlika Highway from the Universidad de Santa Isabel – Pili Campus up to Pili National High School. The two extremes of the Pili Poblacion Belt were not located but are nearby to the Poblacion district.\n\nCentral Bicol State University of Agriculture (CBSUA), a state university, has its main campus located in the capital town of Pili. Its other campuses can be found in the towns of Pasacao, Sipocot, and Calabanga, which are all in the province of Camarines Sur. The university also houses the Computer Science High School of Bicolandia in its main campus which is now DepEd- administered. The CBSUA is now SUC level IV and ISO 9001:2015 accredited, and celebrate its centennial year in 2018. The University continues to be a Center of Development first in Agricultural and then Education and Teaching Education in the country and is known as one of the National University/College of Agriculture (NUCA) in the Philippines.\n\n"}

This patron of San Fernando, according to historical records, was however not the original patron saint for whom the first settlers built the chapel. They actually built a chapel in honor of their patron saint San Fernando. However, for some unusual reasons, the image was lost after it had been transferred into the newly erected chapel. It was said that efforts were wielded to find the missing icon but it all ended into great frustration as the lost image of San Fernando was not found. One resident from the old site where the image was housed later informed the people of San Fernando that the image returned to its original location. With this incident, the Teniente del Barrio then decided to install the image of another saint, Saint John the Baptist.

The track is sung by Rosie Wilson (also known as Roses Gabor) with backing vocals from Damon Albarn and features vocals by Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder. It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart in September 2005, becoming the band's only UK number one.\n\nThe CD single was released in Europe on 29 August 2005. It reached number one in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2005. On the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, it peaked at number 87 on 14 January 2006 and number eight on the Modern Rock Tracks chart on 4 March 2006.\n\nChris Evans stated at the 2006 Brit Awards that the song was originally to have been called \"It's There\", but was changed due to Shaun Ryder's strong Mancunian accent making it sound like he was saying \"It's dare.\" In a 2017 interview with Chris Moyles on Radio X Ryder confirmed his version of events, that it was him requesting a change to his headphone level, \"it's going up, it's going up, it's there!\".\n\nRoses Gabor (Rosie Wilson) takes over the role of \"Noodle\" from Miho Hatori, who provided the vocals for her on the first album. 2-D provides backing vocals; however, to blend his vocals with Noodle's, his voice was toned down to be slightly covered up by Noodle. 2-D's full vocalization can be heard on the \"D-Sides\" remix album. \"D-Sides\" features a demo version of Dare entitled \"People\". This version contains the same background beat but lacks the majority of the keyboards and effects found in the final recording and contains different lyrics. Unlike the final version, it is completely sung by 2-D (voiced by Damon Albarn) and features an Omnichord breakdown.\n\nIn 2016, vocals of the song were interpolated in Friction's song \"Dare (Hold It Down)\". In 2017, the song was featured in an episode of the British soap opera \"EastEnders\". The song was also featured in the video game \"Just Dance\".\n\nThe music video for \"Dare\" included an appearance by Shaun Ryder (of Happy Mondays and Black Grape fame, at the request of Damon Albarn) as a giant disembodied head kept alive by machinery in Noodle's wardrobe. In a departure for the band, the song is mostly performed in the video by Noodle, with 2-D, Russel, and Murdoc only appearing in short cameos in the video; 2-D is seen listening into Noodle's room by pressing his ear to the floor, Russel is shown seated on a toilet reading a newspaper directly below Noodle's room and Murdoc appears at the end of the video lying in bed with Shaun Ryder, who wakes up, apparently having dreamt up the entire sequence of the video. A voice beside him growls, \"go back to sleep, honey,\" revealing the voice to belong to Murdoc, after which it is further revealed to be another nightmare. That time, it was actually dreamt by Murdoc, who also wakes up bolt upright in his own bed gasping and panting. In commentary, Noodle claims that Murdoc initially protested at her doing the entire video by herself, but she countered that she wrote the song and she had seen him show off too much in the \"Feel Good Inc.\" music video - and adds that he was asleep in his Winnebago for the whole of the shoot up until the final scene.\n\nThe video was directed by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland. The video was leaked a few days prior to its 17 July 2005 release on the official Gorillaz website. The video was later recalled from other websites and the final scene was tweaked slightly; Murdoc's Confederate Naval Jack flag was replaced with that of the Jolly Roger. (The version with the Naval Jack is played in some countries, including Canada.)\n\nThis video calls back to classic horror movies. In the very beginning of the video we see Gorillaz' 'reject false icons' statue, which one may recognize as Pazuzu, the figurine from \"The Exorcist\" and son of the devil. Crows are flying around the building, in a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\". Shaun Ryder is depicted as a Frankenstein-like monster who is brought to life as the music begins. Amongst the contraptions that are part of the life support system appear to be two Atari joysticks and a Speak & Spell from the early 1980s. Ryder's head being kept alive is a reference to the movie \"The Brain That Wouldn't Die\". The tube attached to Ryder's cheek switches from side to side as a tribute to the goofs commonly made in early horror movies. When we see Russel sitting on the toilet, he is holding a newspaper with a headline that reads \"CANNIBAL MASSAKREN\", the Danish title of \"Cannibal Holocaust\". The zoom on Noodle's eye at the end of the video is taken directly from \"Ringu\" and its American remake, \"The Ring\".\n\nUK CD1\n\nUK CD2\n\nUK DVD single\n\nUK digital single\n\nUK digital EP\n\nEuropean CD single\n\nJapanese CD single\n\nAustralian CD single\n\nUS digital single\n\nUS digital EP\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nFormerly known as Patrocinio, it is located at the southern part of the province approximately south of Metro Manila. It is a distance of about from Naga City and away from the town of Pili, the capital town of the province.\n\nThe history of the town of San Jose dates back to 1801 when this town was a barrio of Lagonoy under the name Danlog. The old Parish Priest of Lagonoy, Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called \"Cabayawasnan\" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. Unfortunately, the place was owned by Laurenciano Barcillano who refused to donate the land to the Church. However, through circumstances beyond his control, ownership was passed to the Church.\n\nThe construction of the church began in 1818 and there were only around thirty houses around the area. So, the priest sought the help of the people of Lagonoy. It was a cooperative effort of the people of Lagonoy who worked on the northern part and the people of Danlog on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism.\n\nIn 1813, the town of San Jose was officially established under the name \"Patrocinio\" derived from the word \"Patron\", meaning model. Then it was changed to Patrocinio de San Jose in honor of its Patron Saint, San Jose de Patriarca. Later in 1883, it was shortened to \"San Jose\" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of El Pueblo de Lagonoy and Don Macario Agustin, the first Capitan Municipal of the town.\n\nAfter the founding of the town, progress and development became eminent and this could be attributed to the cooperative efforts of the church and the state. In 1887, the foundations of the municipal building were laid when Venancio Obias was the Captain Municipal. His successors continued the work but the structure was completely destroyed by a very strong typhoon called \"Bagyong Ogis\", so named because the back of the trees were shredded of and trunks turned white in 1898. A big house owned by Capitan Gregorio Patrocinio was made the temporary \"tribunal.\"\n\nWhen the people of Naga decided to take up arms against the Spaniards, Elias Angeles, then the leading \"Guard Civil\" of Naga convinced the people of San Jose to join the revolutionary movement. Ariston Prila, a \"cabeza de barangay\" from barangay Kinalansan heeded the call.\n\nIn the early part of 1903, when the Americans reached the town, there were a handful of revolutionaries led by Jose Valencia and Nicomedes Mata but they fled when they realized that their resistance was futile. The American Government was easily established and continued its pacification campaign while pursuing its goal of effecting changes in various aspects of the lives of the people.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Japanese soldiers reached the town in the latest of 1942. Most of the people had evacuated to the far-flung barangays and up to the mountains of Goa and Lagonoy while some joined the guerilla movement. Filipino-Japanese government continued with an appointed Mayor. Filipino volunteers manned the defense of the town hall which served as garrison while the Japanese Imperial Forces had Goa for its headquarters. Schools were ordered opened by the authorities to allay fears and to give confidence of the people.\n\nWith the end of the Pacific War and the celebration of Independence in 1946, the people slowly rehabilitated their lives from the ravages of the war and returned to their usual milieu with renewed vigor.\n\nMay 19 marks the annual celebration of the feast day of San Jose, the town's patron saint.\n\nSan Jose has a total land area of 4,702.8146 hectares and is bounded in north by Lagonoy, south by Tigaon, east by Lagonoy Gulf, and west by Goa. The whole town is roughly 0.27% of the region's 1.76 million hectares; 0.89% of the total land area of Camarines Sur with an area of 526.680 square kilometers; and 2.26% of the total land area of the 4th Congressional District of Camarines Sur with an area of 207,596.71 hectares.\n\nThe municipality belongs to Type II Climate characterized by the absence of a dry season and very pronounced maximum rainfall from November to December. It is during these months that the Northeast monsoon season occurs and the tropical cyclones contribute to the increased rainfall in the area. In January and February, the effect of these air masses on rainfall is considerably radical. In addition to the north-east monsoon during the months of February and March, the trail winds traveling from East to West do not give significant increase of rainfall. Likely, the month of May is the transition period between the monsoon that is prevalent from June to September. During the south-west monsoon season, the linear system called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITZ), brings the largest amount of rainfall to the area. In October, which is the transitive period between the south-west and north-east monsoons, the tropical cyclone brings considerable amount of rain.\n\nThe rainfall distribution in the municipality is greatly influenced by the air streams, tropical cyclones, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, shorelines, easterly waves and other rainfall-causing weather patterns. The rainfall season occurs from June to December with high rainfall intensity of 285.06mm to 474.22m and less rainfall intensity of 245.30mm to 224.06m from January to the month May which at the same time is the onset of effective rainfall with 75% probability and it would terminate in February of the following year which consequently during this period the mountainous areas receive higher intensity of rainfall. But the trend of monthly rainfall is unimodal (having one peak) and the maximum rain period is from October to December. On the other hand, the monthly average rainfall varies from 125.86mm to 594.56mm with a mean annual rainfall of 298.54mm.\n\nThe winds are influenced by the monsoon and the Pacific Trade System with Northeast direction that occurs in November to February; Easterly winds during the months of March, April, May and October; Southwest winds in June to August; and Westerly winds in September.\n\nThe maximum temperature during the month of January reaches about 27.9°C while 31.8 °C in November. The minimum temperature from December to June reaches about 20.6 °C to 24.5 °C; and the average monthly temperature is recorded at 25.0 °C in January to 27.9 °C in June.\n\nRelative humidity is indicative of the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere. Humidity in the Philippines as in the municipality of San Jose is high because of the warm moist air streams flowing over the archipelago, the surrounding seas, rich vegetation and abundant rainfall. The lowest average relative humidity occurs in May with 85.9%; highest in February with 93.4%; and the annual average humidity is 90% which is higher than the regional and national average of 82%.\n\nThe tropical cyclone is a climatic control that contributes largely to the rainfall from June to December. It was shown to usually cause maximum values of rainfall and winds as exemplified by the highest wind speed of 77 miles per second as recorded in Virac, Catanduanes areas during the height of Typhoon Sening in 1970.\n\nThe tropical cyclones are internationally classified with these depending on their maximum wind speed or peak wind velocities (V) as follows:\n\nThe cyclones affecting the Philippine islands originate from the Pacific Ocean East of the Islands between latitude 8 degrees North, 10 degrees South, traveling on a Westerly or Northwesterly course over the country. It has the highest sustained wind velocity of 6 knots in November to April and lowest sustained wind velocity of 4 knots in September. Note that the average cyclone that passes over mainland Bicol which include San Jose town is 3 cyclones for every 2 years.\n\nThe terrain of the municipality is characterized as level to gently rolling and sloping. About 91.96% is characterized as having a generally flat terrain with a slope 0-3% which is described to be level to nearly level. It practically covers the entire land area of the town except barangay Adiangao which is located along the mountain range of Caramoan Peninsula which has an undulating to rolling terrain with 8.04% portions of steep slopes.\n\nThe elevation of the municipality is roughly 92.55% low to very low with a mean elevation from 0–100 meters above sea level. Hence, low elevation is about 5.72% ranging from 100–300 meters above sea level as well as 1.73% with moderately high elevation ranging from 300–500 meters above sea level.\n\nThe major part of the municipal area is composed of Alluvium River Terraces which is particularly described as \"fluvicatile lacustrine alluvium\" composed of unsorted loosely consolidated pebbles, gravel, silt, coral debris and clay that can be found in flooded plains, riverbanks, sand bars, beaches, and tidal flats. It is notable that river terraces along the Lagonoy River and its tributaries which include also the Rangas River that practically originating from the foot of the Mount Isarog account for about 90.69% or 4,264.9826 hectares of the total land area of the municipality while the rest is of igneous and metamorphic rock origin of which volcanoclast alluvial fans cover about 0.19% or 8.94 hectares. These are specifically found in barangays Catalotoan and Salogon. Note that volcanoclast is a thick and extensive pyroclastic material consists of ashes, cinder lapili, tuff agromerate and volcanic debris while alluvial fans consists only of worked pyroclastics.\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nOn the other hand, barangay Adiangao is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks classified as Basement Complex. It is characterized as highly fractured and folded complex consisting of quartzite, quartzatedspathit and mica schists that cover roughly 5.26% or 247.37 hectares. Meanwhile, the lower part of the place is composed of sedimentary rocks known as crystalline limestone which covers about 3.86% or 181.53 hectares. Crystalline limestone is an extensive transgressive rectal carbonated facies including wall preserved bushes of corals, megafossils and algae structure, detritae to fuffacious limestone showing well developed karst landforms or formation that can be found prevalent in the Caramoan Peninsula.\n\nThe many landforms found in the municipality have been the natural production of the different geographical pressures of the different structural land forms such as alluvial lowland, alluvial fans, sedimentary plateau or masses of residual slopes and thick sedimentary landscapes. Most of its territorial areas are best characterized by broad alluvial plans described as level to nearly level, and moderately well-drained terraces. The level to undulating plains are the product of paludal environment or deltaic plains which are usually being flooded during slight and heavy downpours.\n\nOn the other hand, Barangay Adiangao is characterized by Shale/Sandstone Hills (SSH) which is described to be undulating to rolling, slightly to moderately dissected, and moistly top-rounded hills, both are low and high relief. Likewise, steep slopes are dissected closely with each other particularly those with greater than 18 inclinations. Meanwhile, V-shaped valleys are noted to have been composed and dominated by sandstone. Likewise, landforms in barangays Dolo, Sabang, part of Minoro, Manzana and Tagas are noted to be flat with very poorly drained terrains and oftentimes affected by floods caused by high tides. The coastal plains are most commonly swarmed with mangroves, nipa plants, break rides, swales and tidal flats.\n\nThe municipality is composed of 5 major types of Land Management Units (LMUs) which are classified into 2 forms, namely: Warm Lowland and Warm Cool Hillyland. They are enumerated and explained below.\n\nWarm Lowland:\n\nWarm Cool Hillyland:\n\nThe soil map reveals that the municipality is composed of 9 soil types, namely:\n\nIt is also noted that the soil composition of the low-lying areas is rich loamy characterized as broad alluvial plains. However, the inherent soil fertility is generally moderate because of the moderate levels of calcium and magnesium contents that would be adequate for normal growth of crops. Meanwhile, the solids of the coastal plains are generally deep to poorly drained while beach ridges are shallow, coarse and loamy. These areas are noted to be moderately fertile due to low organic matter content; while some areas are poorly drained and prone to tidal floods usually occurring in barangays Sabang, Dolo, and Kinalansan.\n\nOn the other hand, soils that came from shales and sandstones can be found in barangay Adiangao. These are noted to be moderately shallow to moderately deep, fine loamy to clayey. Generally, it is high in fertility brought about by adequate levels of soil reaction, organic matter content, and permeability. However, soil limitations may include heavy texture, erosion hazard, surface stoniness as well as the presence of rock outcrops and shallow soils.\n\nThe lands that are prone to erosion account for about 8.04% of the total land area and they have slopes ranging from 30%-50%. However, the erosion map of the municipality revealed that only 8.49% of the total land area are observed to be slightly eroded while no apparent erosion occurred in the rest of the territory.\nSource: MPT Estimates\n\nIt has been noted that most of the municipal area or 92.14% is free from the hazards of flooding. However, there is a slight seasonal flooding or about 1.67% that usually occur in barangay Minoro and in the northern part of Dolo which covers about 78.54 hectares. The flood reaches a depth of less than 0.5 to 1.0 meter after heavy downpour. It would usually recedes within 12 hours to a maximum of one day. Likewise, seasonal flooding is moderately experienced in some portions of barangays Dolo, Manzana, Kinalansan, Telegrafo and Calalahan with a depth of about 0.75 to 1.50 meters which would usually recedes within a few days only.\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nThere are a number of creeks and rivers that crisscross the municipality and all draining towards the Lagonoy Gulf. These bodies of water are being feed by spring sources from Mt. Isarog. These rivers and creeks are most frequently being utilized not only for irrigation purposes of existing paddies but also for the day to day human activities such as bathing and washing.\n\nThe municipality has a total length of shoreline along the Lagonoy Gulf of 11.30 km. which is about 3.15% of the 358.70 km. of shoreline found within the 4th District of Camarines Sur. The fine beach sand in the area makes it suitable for natural harbors as well as refuge for ships and motorbancas during the peak of weather disturbances. Moreover, a variety of marine life and species are notably abounding in the municipal waters that provided a rich source of livelihood among coastal families. At present, there are two separate municipal ports, one located in barangay Sabang and the San Jose Fishing Port in Sitio Talisay, of barangay Dolo. They most frequently served as docking points for both inter-island passenger motorbancas and fishing vessels operating in Lagonoy Gulf.\n\nThe entire land area of San Jose with 4,702.8146 hectares is classified as alienable and disposable. The existing land use and vegetation is composed of 62.04% for Paddy rice irrigated with 90-100% dominant land use; 26.48% for Coconuts; 7.33% for Build-up areas; 2.54% for Mangrove-tree type; and 1.61% for Beach sand.\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nThe primelands of the municipality have been categorized into three (3), namely: Agricultural, Forestry, and Miscellaneous areas.\n\nThe agricultural areas is composed of about 82.09% or 3,860.54 hectares consisting the 2,918.0965 hectares of irrigated paddy riceland and 942.4440 hectares of coconut plantation. Forestry areas cover 414.7883 hectares, of which about 3.51% or 14.5787 hectares each compose the preservation forest and agro-forestry areas; while 19.61% or 81.3587 hectares are both mangrove trees and nipa plants categorized also as preservation areas. On the other hand, built-up areas is only about 7.05% of 331.5484 hectares of the total land area of the municipality.\n\nFurthermore, based on the Pedo-ecological Zone Map of the town, around 90.13% or 4,238.6468 hectares of the total land area are under the warm lowland zone with a slope not greater than 8% and elevation of 100 meters above sea level. In the same context, about 8.35% or 392.6850 hectares are categorized as warm cool hilly land, usually found in barangay Adiangao; and miscellaneous areas composed the so-called Miscellaneous areas which is about 1.52% or with a land area of about 71.4828 hectares.\n\nMeantime, the details on pedo-ecological zone based on the total land area can be found in the table below:\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nBased on the table below, the Land Use Opportunity Map of the municipality indicate that there are four classes of land use opportunity available which include 83.76% or 3,939.08 hectares for active agricultural areas; 5.18% or 243.61 hectares for rehabilitation areas; 2.17% or 102.05 for wetland areas; and 8.89% or 418.08 hectares for miscellaneous land usage. More specifically, the active agricultural areas though used for agricultural cultivation can be intended for complementary uses for human settlements and infrastructure development such as the construction of roads, bridges, and irrigation facilities. Meanwhile, the miscellaneous land areas may also include the built-up areas, river wash and other miscellaneous land usages.\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nThe agricultural land areas composed about 88.52% of the total land area or 4,162.9315 hectares are planted with both palay and coconut trees. On the other hand, the wetland areas cover about 2.54% of the total land areas with 119.4515 hectares and 1.61% composed the sandy beaches with the land area of 75.7153 hectares; while about 7.33% or 344.7163 hectares consisted the built-up land areas. Details are shown in the table below:\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nThe municipality has been endowed with a variety of mineral resources because of its diverse geological terrain which are partly located within the mountain ranges of Caramoan Peninsula. It has been known that the marble deposit in barangay Adiangao has an estimated volume of 71,772,912 metric tons; and it has been contained along the Maangas-Adiangao area and believed to be suitable for dimension stones.\n\nThere is noted also a considerable amount of deposit of \"guano\" inside the Adiangao Caves. On the other hand, high quality sand, gravels and boulders are abundantly found along the Rangas River traversing barangays Bagacay, Mampirao, Pugay, Calalahan, Tambangan and Calawit.\n\nThe parallel location of the Bicol Volcanic Belt, or Philippine Fault Zone, to the Deep Philippine Trench practically contributed to the triangulated distribution of events with faults or volcanic abnormalities within the earthquake belts in the Bicol Region. It has been observed that the Bicol Volcanic Belt or Chain had a span of 240 km. from Camarines Norte in the North down to Sorsogon in the South with a total of 16 volcanoes separately spread over by about 24 km. apart and rested parallel along the 200 km. chain west of the Philippine Trench, which is the major source of earthquake in the region. The trench can be described as a long, narrow, and generally steep-sided very deep depression in the ocean floor. The axis of a trench marks, the position of a subduction zone where old oceanic lithospheric plates begin their descent into the earth's interior.\n\nIn 1987, a study was conducted which reveals that the Bicol Region particularly the location of San Jose is a part prone to earthquakes of intensify 5 from the above-cited source zones. Based on the frequency of volcanic eruptions that occurred in the region, there are three prominent volcanoes which are considered to be active, namely: Mt. Mayon, Mt. Bulusan, and Mt. Iriga (Asog). The latter is the nearest to the Municipality of San Jose.\n\nMount Iriga (Asog) has a peak of 1,143 meters above sea level and classified to be \"stratovolcanoe\" or it has a composite cone like that of Mt. Mayon and last record of eruption was in 1628 A.D. which eventually damned the Barit River but consequently created the Lake Buhi, the home of the smallest fish in the world with scientific name \"Pandaka pygmaea\" locally known as \"tabios.\"\n\nIn the , the population of San Jose, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe population projection was computed based on Geometric formula resulting to an average annual increase of 2.62%. Based on projections, the ten most populated barangays will be composed of Calalahan, Sabang, Salogon, Kinalansan, Dolo, Pugay, Tagas, Danlog, Tambangan, and Mampirao. As computed, the population projection by age group 22–35 years old registered the highest percentage share at 17.45% followed by 10-14 age cohort by 13.62%; 36–45 years old by 10.31%; 46–59 years old by 8.99%; and 7–9 years old by 8.85%.\n\nIn 2010, the municipality has a total household population of 8,029 of which 995 or 12.39% are in the urban while 7,034 or 87.61% are in the rural area. Of the total population of 38,523, about 12.26% or 4,722 are in the urban while majority which is about 87.74% or 33,801 are residing in the rural area. It has an average household size of 5.38 members per household while population density of 691 persons per square kilometers; urban with 3,083 persons and rural with 618 persons per square kilometers, respectively.\n\nThe ten densely populated barangays in the municipality include Sabang, Salogon, Calalahan, Kinalansan, Pugay, Dolo, Danlog, Adiangao, Tagas, and Mampirao in that order. The least populated barangays are San Vicente with 174 and Bahay with 316.\n\nSource: \"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan and Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"\n\nAs of 2000, the household population of the municipality is composed of 16,695 or 51.35% with ages ranging from the legal age of 18 years and above; while less than half of its population or 48.65% composed the ages from under 1 to 17 years old. Of these, the Senior Citizens belong to the age group ranging from 60 and above which registered only about 6.43%. It can also be noted that of these household population, the age group 22-35 ranked first with 17.45%, followed by 10-14 with 13.62% and 36-45 with 10.31%. The same indication can be observed when based on the gender.\nSource: \"Philippine Statistics Authority\"\n\nThe range of age structure based on the total population which registered a total of 13,421 or 41.28% composed the age group 14 years old and below. On the other hand, 15–60 years and above has an aggregate total of 19,091 or 58.72%.\n\nIn San Jose, there are more males than females. Males outnumbered the females by 0.82%. The computed gender ratio is 1.02% or equivalent to 102 males for every 100 females.\n\nMajority of the households are engaged in farming, livestock raising (either backyard or commercial scale), or in fishing. Some are employed in the government and private offices and others are engaged in business, trading or are self-employed.\n\nA number of agro-related industries are present in San Jose, including welding shops, manufacturers of threshers, hand tractor, cart and plows, ice making and cold storage facilities, rural banks, and several rice mills.\n\nLocal products include:\n\nThe commercial activities of the town are considered as small-scale with capitalization ranging from ₱50,000 to ₱5,000,000 only. About 60.75% of the 48 business establishments are general stores. Other commercial establishments include palay traders, cono ricemill, feed dealers, bakeries, welding shops, vulcanizing shops, photo studio, cable TV operators, gasoline stations, balcksmith, textile, rural bank and drugstores.\n\nThe municipal public market located at barangay Boclod has a total of 112 stalls with sizes ranging from 4x6 meters to 2.75 and 2.25 meters or an area per stall of 6.87 sq.m. to 24 sq.m. Some stalls have already been occupied/rented while others remained vacant.\n\nThe proximity of the town to Goa which is considered as the major trading center in the Partido District, and the low population level and the population growth rate of the municipality are considered to be the reasons for the underdevelopment of commerce and trade. Aside from the small market base, most of the consumers prefer to shop in Goa where a more complete array of goods and services can be found.\n\nSan Jose is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.<ref name=\"DILG/DRRM Barangay Profile\"></ref>\n\nMany prominent men took turns in holding the reigns of the government from 1813 up to 1903 as Capitan Municipal, Juez de la Paz and Maestro Municipal, and their names and year(s) of service can be found printed at the walls of the lobby of the Municipal building.\n\nIn the history of the local chief executives, the only woman elected as mayor was Salvacion R. Valer from 1960 to 1963.\n\nSpanish period \"Capitan Municipal\":\n\"Jueces\" (judges):\n\n\"Juez de sementera y de policia\":\n\n\"Maestros municipal\":\n\nAmerican regime Presidents:\nJustice of peace:\n\nMayors:\nSan Jose is endowed with natural tourism spots that, when fully developed, could possibly generate additional income for the municipality. This includes the numerous beaches with crystalline clear water along the coastline of Lagonoy Gulf and the Adiangao Cave at barangay Adiangao.\n\nCapitano Municipal Venancio Peñas initiated the building of the municipal hall during his term of office in 1877. His successors contributed to its completion, however, Typhoon \"Uguis\" hit the town in 1898 that caused the eventual destruction of the building. Several years after this calamity, the residence of Gregorio Patrocinio who was the Capital Municipal at that time was utilized as the municipal hall.\n\nIn the early days, the parochial house in the town was also utilized as the municipal tribunal. So that, before the construction of the municipal hall, the old convent could have been the government tribunal. In 1912, the already destroyed municipal hall was rehabilitated when Job Obias took office as the president of the town. The work never ceased until the zealous leader able to see the roof installed with galvanized iron sheets. Meantime, the balcony at the front, right above the main entrance of the municipal building was added during the presidency of Isaias Obias (1920-1922).\n\nDuring the presidency of Jovito Dizon (1923-1925), the wooden stairs and floor was constructed, which until this time the same wooden stairs and floor exist where they were built. An engraved proof of this construction is seen on the Spanish stone wall of the municipal building. This engraved marker always greets everyone who takes the first step in climbing up the historic wooden stairs. It was told that San Joseños took the pride of owning the biggest municipal hall in the Bicol Region in 1953.\n\nAt present, the people of San Jose can take the pride and honor of having the only functional centuries-old municipal building still in its admirable strength and durability.\n\nThe site of the Catholic Church where it majestically stands until now, including all other church properties, was owned by Laurenciano Barcellano. It was chosen by Fr. Salvador Mendoza who considered the place as the most appropriate part to build the Church. The place was formerly called sitio \"Cabayawasnan\" which means guavas or guava orchard. In the 1880s, the place was known to have been grown with many guava trees particularly in the quadrangle which served as the spacious backyard of the old convent. The front part also served as the usual venue for religious and cultural activities such as the \"cenaculo.\" It was told that once the wooden gates of the quadrangle were opened to the public, the folks or their children would usually take the chance of exploring the whole place even to the most secluded part of this area, of course without the watching eyes of the people in the convent.\n\nThe construction of the church started in 1818 under the strictest rule of the Cura Parocco, Fr. Mendoza. It has a Romansque architectural dimension with lime-plastered walls designed by a certain Felix Paete. The sand and lime used in its construction were taken from barangay Dolo, about 6 kilometers away.\n\nThe parishioners rendered the hard labor and experienced the extent of Polo Method in the construction of the church. At dusk time, the workers were already gathered around the designated place before the start of the work. According to old folks account, the workers were parading in the darkness of the night while carrying torches to light their way to reach the starting point of the work before dusk. They endured the rugged, thickly forested and muddy trail to make the very slow and difficult manual transport of the building materials and to make while of their hard labor, they would usually entertain themselves with songs and music as they carried the lime and sand from barangay Dolo to the site.\n\nWhen the church was completed, there were donations received by the parish for its accessories. The belfry at the center of the church facade that holds the big bronze bell donated by Dalmacia Obias. The bell is considered to be the queen of the bells at the center of the belfry. People can find also two other smaller bells hanging at each side of the belfry beside the gigantic bronze bell. Accordingly, these three bells when rang send the intended message to all its parishioners, purportedly summoning them to come to church to attend mass. It would take a master ringer to harmoniously blend the sound of the bells with the queen bronze bell on the central command.\n\nOne can take notice of the church altar which is exactly the same altar that it had when the workers of the church had it constructed. The design of the retablo and the materials used are made from solid hard wood to give it an appropriate care of preservation. The present walnut color of paint applied to the retablo was made really intentional to conform with its original paint upon its construction, and the gold ornaments added are carefully designed to adapt to the centuries-old design that it was.\n\nMeantime, the presidential chair where the parish priest sits is still the original chair used by the very first Cura. It was said to have undergone some minor repairs, but its main parts and appearance generally remained almost exactly the same as it was first used by Fr. Salvador Mendoza. Also the altar fence marks the separation of the priest's place from the parishioners. It then upholds the sacredness of the altar. It likewise undergone minors repairs but the original design and materials are preserved.\n\nThe gigantic monument of Christ the King (Cristo Rey) can be found at the church patio. It was donated by Primitiva Ortiz Obias and inaugurated on October 27, 1952. The monument was mounted on an elevated portal to give it a lordly treatment. It is facing east at the town center. Likewise, the base of the monument portal is also elevated like a low-raised floor. People love to stay by sitting on its floor, playing around, or simply enjoy the peace it offers.\n\nThe convent was built later than the church. Accordingly, before its construction, the first Cura could have stayed in an improvised parochial house made of caña and nipa. It also functioned as the municipal tribunal. During the Spanish time, the residence of the Cura was also the residence of the capitan municipal.\n\nThe old convent as still seen today is made of thick stone walls with wooden floors. It is very spacious and too big for one Cura. It also had many spacious rooms to accommodate visiting priests.\n\nDuring World War II, this old convent was known to have served as the headquarters of the American Volunteer Soldiers while the pavement was used as the jail. In 1988, this old convent was converted into a preparatory seminary. In fact, its size made Archbishop Leonardo Z. Legaspi decide to covert it into a Pre-College Seminary purposely to accommodate the growing need of the Holy Rosary Minor Seminary for a formation house. In the same year, the old convent was made a preparatory seminary in consultation with then Parish Priest, Fr. Eutiquio Infante and it initially accepted seminarians on July 1, 1988 with Fr. Raul S. Pan as the first rector. In 1991, the name was changed to Holy Rosary Preparatory Seminary based on the provisions of the formation manual for the diocesan priestly life and ministry, \"That Christ May Be Formed in Us.\"\n\nThe municipality has a total of 98.046 kilometers road length consisting of the National, Provincial, Municipal and Barangay roads. Approximately 6.730 kilometers or 6.864% of the total road length are classified as National roads, 24.830 kilometers or 25.3248% are provincial roads, 4.920 kilometers or 5.018% are Municipal roads and 61.566 kilometers or 62.793% are barangay roads with varying road conditions.\n\nBased on the standard of 1.000 kilometers of road for every square kilometer of land area, the municipality requires 47 kilometers of road length. The existing road length in the area of 98.046 kilometers actually include all types of roads. Thus, this would only indicate that the existing roads are sufficient to facilitate the efficient transportation of agricultural and fishing products of the municipality.\n\nThere are 18 bridges existing in the area, the longest of which is located in barangay Pugay, a reinforced concrete deck girder (RCDA), one in Mampirao, Salogon, and the rest are Spanish-type bridges that are made of bricks and reinforced concrete, spillways and footbridges.\n\nThe \"Partido\" water supply system of the Partido Development Administration (PWSS-PDA) Level III supplies the potable water. It has its water source from Lagonoy. There are 6 pipe connections from the poblacion area to the barangays of Camagong, Danlog, part of Boclod, Kinalansan, Manzana, Telegrafo, Dolo, and Sabang. The rest of the people are dependent from the artesian wells particularly in barangays along the Lagonoy Gulf; as well as deepwells, shallow wells, and improved springs.\n\nAs of 2010, the entire municipality has already been energized by the Camarines Sur IV Electric Cooperative (CASURECO IV). The latter supplies energy to approximately 3,260 residential connections as shown in the table below:\n\nThere are at least 3 entities that provide the communications needs of the LGU. They are the Philippine Postal Corporation, Bayantel Group of Companies, Smart, and Globe Telecom Companies. The most common source of information, entertainment, and news is the broadcast media.

This marked the beginning of the celebration of the town fiesta held annually every June 24.\n\nA version known to the local residents concerning the roots of the name of the municipality tells about the coming of the Spaniards to the Philippines, where a certain Captain Aguire of Lupi spent his leisure hours fishing in the cool water of Vigaan River in the morning and in the afternoon he would sail back by banca in the Bicol River. He usually have a plentiful catch which would be more his family needs. This activity did not escape the Spanish encomienderos’ ears in the town of lupi and the said Captain was summoned by the Spaniards for questioning. However, in the process of the inquiry, the Captain misunderstood and misinformed the foreigners and pointed to the Bicol River as his fishing area. The following day, the Spaniards and some native guides equipped with hook and lines went to the river to fish.\n\nUpon reaching the bank they found a shed with Captain Aguirre’s fishing net or “pocot”. They also found in the place different kinds of fishes like bakla, kasili, and buyod. Delighted with their discovery, the Spaniards asked some natives the name of the place. The natives thinking that the Spaniards were asking for the name of the net they were holding, answered “si, pocot”. From then on, the Spaniards built a settlement near the Vigaan River which they christened SIPOCOT.\n\nIn the , the population of Sipocot, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nBanks and financial institutions in Sipocot include Land Bank of the Philippines, RCPI, Rural Bank of Sipocot, Rural Bank of Pamplona, Rural Bank of Minalabac, CARD Bank, BLVING Lending Corporation, M Lhuiller, Tambunting Pawnshop, Cebuana Lhuiller, Henry Lhuiller and Sipocot.

Of these, 1,045 hectare are irrigated riceland.\n\nTigaon's economy is based on agricultural products like rice, corn, sugar cane, abaca fiber, fish, and pork. It is also known for its cottage industry, especially high quality ships-in-bottles. The main tourist attractions are the Mt. Isarog Jungle Park at Barangay Concocep and several beach resorts.\n\nAccording to a certain parish priest, Fr. Marcos de Lisboa, the name of the town was attributed to the word \"tigaw\", a shrub grew in abundance on the river banks, and whose leaves when pounded produced extracts which were used as poison to catch fish in rivers and swamps.\n\nThe Bicol Peninsula was first sighted by the Spaniards in August 1543 aboard the San Juan de Letran. In 1574, Captain Juan de Salcedo conquered the Bicol Region. In 1701, Tigaon was considered a sitio of Sagñay. In 1794, Tigaon was given her own parish under Fray Jose de Buensalida who carried the mission of St. Clare of Assisi, marking August 12 as her feastday.\n\nMayon Volcano's eruption in 1834 started a wave of migration from the neighboring province of Albay to the rich verdant slopes of Tigaon. As the Sword and the Cross became the bedrock of Spanish colonization in the Philippines, the parish priest symbolized the King of Spain and wielded immense power. This resulted in turmoil and continuous revolts against the atrocities of Spanish rule, thereby leading to the Philippine Revolution of 1898. For $20,000,000.00, Spain ceded the Philippines to the Americans.\n\nIn the early years of the 19th century, Camarines Sur was divided into four districts by the Spaniards. This division include the districts of Bikol, Rinconanda, Yraya and Mambulao. The mission of Tigaon in the part of Mount Isarog belonged to the Bikol district.\nThe history of this town, according to written accounts, was considered to be confusing as there are conflicting records with regards to its establishment as a municipality.\n\nIn 1941, the second world war broke. The Japanese entered Tigaon during the term of Mayor Lino Cabaero. The guerrilla movement evolved as an offshoot of Japanese cruelty. Clashes were frequent and the church became a sanctuary of most guerrillas. Fr. Tomas Bernales was parish priest during the period 1941−1942. Fr. Florencio Gonzales took over in 1942. The infamous Death March propelled Doña Leonor Moll to rescue her son, Dr. Heriberto Moll and forty other Bicolanos from the clutches of death. Lt. Salvador Natividad died fighting the Japanese at Mabalodbalod. Captain Edmundo Cea and Majors Salvador and Tomas Garchitorena were at the forefront of battle. Don Pascual Leelin freely disposed his sacks of rice to fellow-Tigaoeños before enemies could confiscate them. In 1945, American forces came back to reclaim the Philippines, thus paving the way for the surrender of the beleaguered Japanese Imperial Army.\n\nWith the advent of independence, Tigaoeños found freedom of expression through the arts. A monopoly of painters, poets, and actors emerged from this town. Luisita Venida was the first Tigaoeña child actress while Jesus ‘Og’ Ramos became the Tarzan of local cinema. Bodybuilder Pepito Ramos was acclaimed “Mr. Philippines”. In the late fifties, Batas Pambansa 129 made Tigaon the seat of the CFI in Partido District. Politics thrived. Don Mariano Garchitorena became Governor of Camarines Sur in 1945. Sebastian Caruso Moll was elected Congressman under the Quirino administration. The same administration chose Don Mariano Garchitorena Secretary of Agriculture. Edmundo Cea, the first Asian to be invited as guest speaker to the United Nations, gained fame as a Congressman, then Senator during the sixties, as a delegate to the 1970 Constitutional Convention and as a member of the defunct Batasang Pambansa. Jose Fuentebella was Ambassador to Indonesia during the Garcia administration. Parish Priest Fr. Florencio Gonzales was succeeded by Fr. Pedro Oliva (1948−1967). Municipal mayors of Tigaon during these years: Heriberto R. Moll (1945-1957); Jose Bosito (1958-1964) and again Heriberto R. Moll (1964−1967).\n\nThere was a time when Tigaon was solely owned by 7 hacienderos namely P. Baduria, L. Cea, J. Jacob, M. Estela, A. Garchitorena and S. Moll. Now their lands was distributed to the people through the Agrarian Reform.\n\nThe NPA Movement in the Bicol Region started in Tigaon which at best typified a feudal society. Brothers Romulo (Kumander Tangkad) and Ruben (Kumander Benjie) Jallores actively guided the growth of this movement. Agrarian unrest became the legitimate cause for the fuelling of socialist ideology. Tenants forcibly planted rice and corn within abaca lands. Eventually, abaca production declined.\n\nIn 1972, martial law was declared. Agrarian Reform was implemented. Felix Fuentebella was appointed governor in 1976, the same year Nelson Baduria Tria was ordained and became the first Tigaoeño priest. The Marcos dictatorship hunted down insurgents and tortured them. Senator Edmundo Cea took the cudgels for Ninoy Aquino's widow, Corazon. The church played an important role in the series of events that was to lead to the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in the EDSA Revolution of 1986. Tigaon's St. Clare of Assisi Parish became the rallying point of Cory Aquino's cause in Camarines Sur's third district. Parish priests in Tigaon were Fr. Jose Rey (1967−1984) and Fr. Felix Barela (1984−1985). In 1986, Gallardo Bombase, Jr. was ordained. He became the first Filipino parish priest of the University of Santo Tomas. Municipal Mayors during this time: Gualberto Cea Manlagñit (1968−1971); Lucio Palaypayon, Jr. (1972); Federico Moll (acting capacity, 1973−1976); and Claudio Francisco (appointed 1976/ elected 1980−1986).\n\nGradually, order was restored. The Senate and Congress were once again part of the country's democratic process. Delfin Recto was appointed Mayor of Tigaon. Julian Cea Napal became Vice Governor of Camarines Sur. Francis Garchitorena occupied the position of SandiganBayan Justice. The crusade of the NPA Movement gained recognition from the ruling administration. Continuing peace talks were held to resolve the differences between government and the CPP/NPA.\n\nThe democratic form of government once more dominated the political scene. Municipal Mayors were: Roman de Leon, Jr. (OIC, 1987, Transitional Gov’t); and Eleanor R. Lelis (1988−1992). Arnulfo Fuentebella, elected in 1992, held the congressional seat for Camarines Sur's third district.\n\nParish priests were Fr. Alfonso Grageda (1985−1991) and Fr. Eutiquio Infante (1991−1997).\n\nOnce more, Tigaon is on the move. Municipal Mayor Mariano B. Llaguno (1992−1998) was succeeded by Mayor Elmo L. Bombase while Fr. Danilo Tuason became Parish Priest of Tigaon. The Sword and Cross have never been apart in the Tigaoeño way of life. Hand in hand with the construction of the Parish rectory was Tigaon's new municipal building. After a nine-year term, Mayor Bombase was succeeded by Mayor Arnie Fuentebella (2007–present). The Rev. Msgr. Juan Celzo, Fr. Rodolfo Sales and incumbent parish priest Fr. Noel Emmanuel Alforte were assigned successively to continue the church's mission in Tigaon.\n\nTigaon is politically subdivided into 23 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Tigaon was people, with a density of .\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the Isarog Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 5 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language.

Its main tributaries are the Sochur, Orlovka, Lisitsa, Little Ket, Mendel, Yelovaya, and Chachamga.\n\nThe Ket once served as one of the main river routes in Siberia. A portage near its headwaters allowed one to cross from the Ob River basin to the Yenisei River basin. The Russians established a fort at Ketsk a few miles above the Ob in 1602 and another at Makovsk near the head of navigation in 1618. Makovsk was also called Makarskoi Fort or Makovskaya Pristan (Makovsk Landing). The portage east to Yeniseysk, one of the longest portages in Siberia, was called the Makarskoi Portage. When John Bell sailed down the Ket in August 1722 he compared it to the River Styx. He complained about the crookedness, sandbars, mosquitos, lack of inhabitants and the tall trees and brambles on both sides which made it gloomy. His voyage from Makovsk to the Ob took 25 days. In the late 19th-century the Ket-Kas Canal connected the Ket with the Greater Kas River which flows into the Yenisei. This project made the Ket a part of a waterway system connecting the Ob River basin with the Yenisei. But the canal - shallow, long, inconveniently located, and frozen for the greater part of the year - proved uncompetitive with the Trans-Siberian Railway, and was abandoned around 1921.\n\nSee also Ket people.\n"}

It begins with a flashback to when Frieza destroyed the Saiyan home world, Planet Vegeta. Cooler's ship soon picks up a Saiyan space pod on the radar. The pod, carrying a baby Saiyan named Kakarot, is shown to be heading towards Earth, but Cooler's henchmen believe it is an escape. Cooler lets the ship go, accounting that it's Frieza's naïveté, and responsibility. More than twenty years later, Kakarot, eventually renamed Goku because of his adoptive new life on Earth, transforms into a Super Saiyan and defeats Frieza on Planet Namek. Despite showing no compassion towards his brother, Cooler takes his Armored Squadron - Doore, Neiz, and Salza to Earth with the intention of killing Goku in order to reclaim his family's honor. His forces ambush Goku and his friends on a camping trip, and Goku is wounded when he takes a blast from Cooler that was intended for Gohan (who has his regrown Saiyan tail).\n\nAfter Krillin and Oolong sets up a shelter in a cave with Goku, Gohan flies off on his dragon friend Icarus to obtain Senzu Beans from Korin. After obtaining the beans, Gohan restores the now-exhausted Icarus by feeding him one bean, and they both fly in high speed. But then, they are ambushed by Cooler's henchmen who blast down Icarus and give Gohan a beating. Just as Gohan about to be killed by Doore, the monkey-tailed boy is saved by Piccolo, the Namekian of Earth, and Gohan's mentor. Piccolo dispatches Doore and Neiz, and takes on Salza, easily gaining the upper hand. During the battle, Cooler arrives and catches Piccolo off-guard with a Death Beam, which impales him through the chest but does not kill him. Cooler then sends Salza after Gohan as he continues to blast Piccolo. Gohan gets to the cave with the Senzu Beans, but they are destroyed by Salza. However, he heals Goku with a spare bean that Yajirobe gave him earlier. After Krillin and Gohan are beaten down by Salza, Goku appears fully healed. Cooler shows up, holding onto an unconscious Piccolo. He then blasts Piccolo's body with an unexpected attack as Goku watches in horror. Now angered, Goku blasts Salza into the distance, and begins to fight Cooler.\n\nAfter Goku proves to be a worthy opponent, Cooler and tells of his bleak history with Frieza. He then reveals his final transformation, one that Frieza never showed or achieved, and this one is far more powerful than Frieza's final form. Now at full power, Cooler pummels Goku around effortlessly, despite Goku using the \"Kaioken\" attack numerous times. Cooler then proceeds to destroy the landscape. However, after seeing a bird die from wounds inflicted by damage caused during the struggle, Goku thinks back on his friends and family, and how they all will be killed if Cooler wins. He then picks up the dead bird and lets out a yell so powerful it cracks solid stone and draws Cooler's attention, transforming into his Super Saiyan form and giving enough of his energy to revive the bird. Cooler then finds himself, like Frieza was, grossly outclassed by Goku's amazing new powers. After attempting to punch and blast the Super Saiyan with no effect, Cooler summons a trump card when he powers up an enormous ball of energy. Cooler launches the attack with hopes to destroy Goku and the Earth along with him. After a stint of struggling, Goku eventually manages to send it back with the \"Kamehameha\" wave, forcing Cooler off the Earth into space and towards the sun. As he hits the sun's surface, Cooler realises that Goku was the same Saiyan infant he spared decades ago. Cooler then laments his own lost opportunity to shoot Goku's escape pod down when he was a baby, and concedes that he was too soft for his own good as well. Cooler's body is then seemingly disintegrated by the sun and his own energy blast.\n\nGoku, drained after his battle, is found by Krillin, Gohan, Oolong and Icarus. They are looking for Piccolo when Salza reappears and prepares to kill them all. However, before he can attack, Salza, the last of Cooler's Armored Squadron, is killed by Piccolo's \"Special Beam Cannon\" from a distance. Gohan looks around for Piccolo, and the movie ends with Piccolo, having recovered, gazing skyward after drinking some water.\n\n is the brother of Frieza who travels to Earth to seek revenge against Goku for Frieza's death, not to avenge his brother, but for vengeance for the slight against his family. Despite transforming into his final form, he is defeated by Super Saiyan Goku. He returns in the sequel, \"The Return of Cooler\", his remains having fused with a sentient computer chip to form the Big Gete Star. He invades New Namek to fuel himself, but is foiled once again and destroyed once and for all by Goku and Vegeta. He returns briefly in \"Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans\" as a ghost warrior created by Dr. Lychee, and makes cameo appearances in \"Dragon Ball GT\" and \"Fusion Reborn\". He was also reappeared in \"Super Dragon Ball Heroes\" anime and manga as Goku and Vegeta quickly recognizes him that he was destroyed in the second movie. He is voiced by Ryūsei Nakao (who also voiced Frieza) in Japanese, and by Andrew Chandler in the English dub.\n\nLike the mercenary Ginyu Force (right down to the posing) called upon by Frieza on Planet Namek, composes the elder brother's own special fighting team. These three warriors serve as Cooler's subordinates throughout the course of the film. Their dress is the customary garb of soldiers in Frieza's military; an extended length of armor juts from their left shoulder, while the uniforms themselves are in Cooler's primary colors of purple and white, they are shown to have a habit of blocking or reflecting Ki Blasts rather than dodging them. The team is made up of Cooler's right-hand man , a blue skinned \"pretty-boy\" commander with blonde hair and a French accent, who is able to slice through objects using a blade of ki formed in his right hand and very similar to Zarbon in appearance; , an amphibian-like tall, brown reptilian creature who can retract the whole of his head into his body, who can fire an electrical attack that can immobilize his opponents; and , who is large, green-skinned and long-haired, never seen without his helmet. The henchmen's names are derived from puns; in this case, it is condiments and salad dressings. All three are killed by Piccolo, who obliterates Doore with a Ki blast, burns Neiz alive with his own attack, and impales Salza with the Special Beam Cannon. Salza and Doore cameo in \"Fusion Reborn\".\n\nA fourth English version released exclusively in Malaysia by Speedy Video features an unknown voice cast.\n\n\nThe following songs were present in the Funimation dub of \"Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge\".\n\nOn the Cooler Double Feature, there is an alternate audio track containing the English dialogue and Japanese background music by Shunsuke Kikuchi that is selected by default.

Ahead of the front, a highly unstable air mass combined with a strong jet stream that increased the synoptic-scale lifting favoring supercell development. Meanwhile, backed southerly low-level winds brought moist dew points well into the region. The National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Norman, Oklahoma, put out a high risk for severe weather over much of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and northern Kentucky. A notable feature of this outbreak is that there was a sector of weak tornadoes north of Terre Haute, Indiana, while a sector of strong and vicious tornadoes developed south of the city. This could perhaps be attributed to the storms in central Indiana having weaker helicity—a measurement of storm rotation—resulting in many of the storms farther to the north being left-moving supercells.\n\nThis extremely long-tracked F4 tornado began near Aden, littering I-64 with trees and overturning a truck before striking Barnhill, where 10 homes were destroyed and 10 others were damaged. The tornado then struck Albion, where a factory, homes, and other buildings were destroyed. The tornado then caused severe damage in the Browns area, where one woman was killed in her home. In the town of Mt. Carmel, the tornado ripped apart seventeen homes and severely damaged Wabash Valley College before crossing into Indiana. In Indiana, the tornado passed near Hazleton, Bowman, Petersburg, and Orrville, where a barn was destroyed. In Daviess County, Indiana, the tornado caused $10,000,000 in damage as it destroyed 10 homes and damaged 35 others. A cabin was crushed by a tree as the tornado passed near Shoals, resulting in four injuries. The tornado passed near Whitfield before dissipating near Huron. A total of eleven people were injured by this tornado.\n\nA powerful F4 tornado developed west of Union and proceeded to enter that community from Gibson County. The tornado completely leveled one home, killing two occupants, and also blew another off its base. After passing through a wooded area, the tornado hit Petersburg, killing four people there. Upon entering the town limits, it leveled a nursing home plus an apartment complex and up to ten homes. Having now killed six people, the tornado was the deadliest to hit Indiana since the 1974 Super Outbreak. It then struck the business district in downtown Petersburg and destroyed 19 businesses before going on to level 168 additional homes and damage an elementary school in Petersburg. The town became the hardest hit in Indiana on June 2, 1990. The tornado destroyed half of Petersburg, including the home of the mayor. 60 others were injured by this tornado.\nA violent nighttime tornado began west of Bright, Indiana, with 50 homes destroyed in that area.

Two of the terrace clusters in Banaue, namely Bangaan and Batad, are part of the UNESCO World Heritage inscription. It is said that their length, if put end to end, would encircle half of the globe. The terraces are believed by many to be more than 2,000 years old as postulated by early Philippine anthropologist Otley Beyer, recent studies by carbon dating however contends this and instead the structures may be less than 1,000 years old. The rice terraces manifest the engineering skill and ingenuity of the sturdy Ifugaos. They are irrigated by means of mountain streams and springs that have been tapped and channelled into canals that run downhill through the rice terraces.\n\nThe rice terraces once stretched north-east to Cagayan and as far south as Quezon. However they are now slowly being abandoned and showing signs of deterioration. The 1990 Luzon earthquake damaged some of the terraces' irrigation systems, while El Niño triggered droughts that led giant earthworms to erode the terraces' soil. Furthermore, the rice variety most suited to the area's cool climate is not a high-yielding crop; because it takes so long to mature, some Ifugao families have abandoned their land in the rice terraces in favour of land that reaps faster rewards.\n\nAn Ifugao Terraces Commission was created in 1994 and was superseded by the Banaue Rice Terraces task force, which was closed in 2002.\n\nUNESCO has listed the Batad Rice Terraces and Bangaan Rice Terraces as a World Heritage Site since 1995, under the designation, \"Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras\".\n\nAll located in the Ifugao region, the Rice Terraces also feature as one of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Sites or GIAHS. They are supported by indigenous knowledge management of muyong, a private forest that caps each terrace cluster. The muyong is managed through a collective effort and under traditional tribal practices. The communally managed forestry area on top of the terraces contains about 264 indigenous plant species, mostly endemic to the region. The terraces form unique clusters of microwatersheds and are part of the whole mountain ecology. They serve as a rainwater filtration system and are saturated with irrigation water all year round. A biorhythm technology, in which cultural activities are harmonised with the rhythm of climate and hydrology management, has enabled farmers to grow rice at over 1 000 metres.\n\nContrary to popular notion, the Banaue Rice Terraces as seen from the viewpoint are not included in the UNESCO inscription, due to the presence of numerous modern structures. However, it is a National Cultural Treasure under the Ifugao Rice Terraces.\n\nThe Banaue Rice Terraces were chosen as one of the two green globe destinations of the country by the World Travel and Tour Council. It received an “International Historic Engineering Landmark Award” from the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was also acknowledged by the World Travel and Tour Council as a green globe destination in the Philippines.\n\nThe stone walled rice terraces were built by means of early tools and methods in order to maximise the use of land space, They exceed the height of the world's tallest building if the vertical distance between top and bottom row are measured.\n\n\n"}

She trained at the South Essex Gym Club under coach Rod Smith. She made her international debut at the 1993 Junior European Championships and entered the senior ranks in the following year.\n\nIn 1994 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Reeder became England's youngest ever Commonwealth Games gold medallist at the age of fourteen, collecting golds in the team and the floor exercise. She collected a third gold medal at the Commonwealths in 1998. Reeder was also a European floor finalist in 1994, and a vault finalist in 1998. In the 1996 European Championships in Birmingham, Reeder finished 14th in the all-around, the highest ranking recorded for a British athlete at the time. Reeder represented the UK at the 1994 team, 1994 individual, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999 World Championships. She was a two time Champion and four time silver medalist at British Nationals and the English Champion in 1996.\n\nGreat Britain did not qualify to send a full team to the 1996 Olympics, but were permitted to send two gymnasts to compete as individuals. Reeder was the higher-ranked of the two British gymnasts, placing 66th in the prelims. At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney Australia, Reeder captained the British women's team. The squad finished 10th, its best Olympic placement ever. Annika qualified to the all-around finals, the culmination of a lifetime's ambition. However,\nher bid to compete in the all-around would be undone by the infamous vault fiasco. Prior to the all-around, unbeknownst to the athletes and coaches, the vaulting horse was set 2 inches (5 cm) too low. This completely altered gymnasts' pre and post-flight, and resulted in many crashes, falls and injuries. Reeder vaulted on the faulty apparatus and was, perhaps, the worst affected by the error. She was so injured on her vault attempts that she had to be helped off the mats and was forced to withdraw from the remainder of the competition.\n\nFollowing the 1999 World Championships, the FIG (Federation of International Gymnastics) added all the new elements into the Code of Points.

The musical was never staged and the song was instead released in September 1970 as part of the Byrds' \"(Untitled)\" album. It was later issued as a single, peaking at number 121 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart and number 19 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThroughout most of 1969, the Byrds' leader and guitarist, Roger McGuinn, had been writing songs with psychologist and Broadway impresario Jacques Levy for a country rock stage production of Henrik Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\" that the pair were developing. The intended title for the musical was \"Gene Tryp\", an anagram of the title of Ibsen's play. \n\nMcGuinn and Levy's production was to loosely follow the storyline of \"Peer Gynt\", albeit with some modifications to transpose the story from Norway to south-west America during the mid-19th century. Ultimately, the \"Gene Tryp\" stage production was abandoned and among the twenty-six songs that McGuinn and Levy had written for the project, six (including \"Chestnut Mare\") would end up being released on the Byrds' \"(Untitled)\" and \"Byrdmaniax\" albums.\n\n\"Chestnut Mare\" was intended to be used during a scene in which the play's eponymous hero attempts to catch and tame a wild horse, a scene that had featured a deer in Ibsen's original. While the majority of \"Chestnut Mare\" had been written specifically for \"Gene Tryp\", the musical accompaniment to the song's Bach-like middle section had actually been written by McGuinn back in the early 1960s, while on tour in South America with the Chad Mitchell Trio.\n\nMusically, \"Chestnut Mare\" echoes the sound of the Byrds' mid-1960s recordings, with McGuinn's chiming 12-string Rickenbacker guitar sitting alongside guitarist Clarence White's country-style acoustic and electric guitar picking. Lyrically, the song's spoken verses recount the story of one man's quest to tame a wild horse, and, as such, it echoes the familiar Byrds' themes of nature and freedom. Byrds expert Tim Connors has also suggested that the song's narrative can be seen to deal in mythic archetypes: the wild mare being an embodiment of untamed nature, which the narrator wants to control, and thus an analogy of mankind's attempts to dominate and subjugate the natural environment.\n\n\"Chestnut Mare\" was initially released as part of the Byrds' \"(Untitled)\" album on September 14, 1970. It was then issued as a single on October 23, 1970, with \"Just a Season\", another McGuinn and Levy song left over from the \"Gene Tryp\" project, on the B-side. The single stalled at number 121 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart, but nonetheless, \"Chestnut Mare\" went on to become a staple of FM radio programming in America during the 1970s.\n\nThe song did much better, however, when it was released as a single in the United Kingdom on January 1, 1971, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, during a chart stay of eight weeks. \"Chestnut Mare\" was the first UK Top 20 hit that the Byrds had achieved since their cover of Bob Dylan's \"All I Really Want to Do\" had peaked at number 4 in September 1965.\n\nAlthough the U.S. single release featured the full-length album version of \"Chestnut Mare\", in the UK and Europe a severely edited version of the song was issued instead. The running time of the album version is 5:08, while the single edit is noticeably shorter at 2:58, due to the removal of the song's second verse and middle section.\n\nFollowing its appearance on the \"(Untitled)\" album, the song would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The band also performed the song in 1971 and 1972 on the German music television program, \"Beat-Club\".\n\nIn addition to its appearance on the \"(Untitled)\" album, \"Chestnut Mare\" appears on several Byrds' compilations, including \"\", \"History of The Byrds\", \"The Byrds\", \"The Very Best of The Byrds\", \"The Essential Byrds\", and \"There Is a Season\". A live performance of the song is also included on The Byrds' \"Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971\" album.\n\nThe Icicle Works covered \"Chestnut Mare\" as a medley with another Byrds' song, \"Triad\", on the 1989 Byrds' tribute album, \"Time Between – A Tribute to The Byrds\".\n"}

In all these years since its establishing in 1937, Rabotnichki has always been among the best clubs, and has always been a good representative of Macedonian football in Europe.\n\nThe club's most successful years were those between 2001 and 2008 when the club was acquired by the famous company Kometal. Since it was acquired by Kometal, Rabotnichki showed constant progress: in 2002/03 they finished second in the national league and competed in the UEFA Cup, (2004/05) they won the national championship and competed in the qualifications for the UEFA Champions League, and in (2007/08) they had their best year by winning the double crown. Kometal and Trifun Kostovski left Rabotnichki and took over Vardar in 2008. The following year they won the Macedonian Cup for the second time in club history.\n\nOn 14 July 2009, they faced Crusaders FC of Northern Ireland in the UEFA Europa League 2nd qualifying round; the 1st leg was drawn 1–1. They managed to win the second leg 4–2 and went out in the 3rd qualifying round against Odense BK after losing 3–7 on aggregate.\n\nOn 16 July 2010, they were drawn against Liverpool in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round. In the first leg on 29 July 2010, they lost 2–0, losing the return leg 2–0 a week later.\n\nIn July 2011, they were named the best club in the World for that month by the IFFHS. The winning streak of five games in the Europa League, from which four were in July, plus a win against Bregalnica in the first round of the domestic league were more than enough for the International Federation of Football History & Statistics to name Rabotnički as the \"Best club in the World for July 2011\".\n\nIn March 2012, with 674 points on the IFFHS list Rabotnički became the best club from Macedonia in the 21st century.\n\nOn 11 May 2014, Rabotnichki won their fourth Macedonian First League title. After winning their third Macedonian Cup the previous week, they accomplished the double crown for the 2nd time in club history.\n\nAssociation of Veterans of Rabotnichki has been functioning informally since the formation of the club Rabotnichki itself, in 1937.\n\nOfficially, the association of the veterans of Rabotnički is formally registered in front of the competent court of law with approval number 29/05 in 18.02.2005, and it is notified in the register of the associations of citizens and foundations under registration number 1928 by the name Rabotnički “Veterans” Skopje with main office in Skopje, city park in large numbers.\nThis association inherited the property of legal entity on 18 February 2005. Apart from this right, of independent legal entity, the association is functioning in association with Rabotnički, generally comparing its policies, delegate its own members in the governing bodies of the club, gives its own opinions, suggestions, and proposals of a common interest, and all this with a purpose-achieving greater results and giving real affirmation of the club in both Macedonia and abroad.\n\nBasic sources of financing of the association are: enrollment fee, sponsorship, as well as goods that are supplied and sold by the club. Members of the association are: Active members who have spent a number of years in the running of the club as well as sportsmen who were active football players in the club for many years, as well as many citizens who have shown an interest in joining the association. Accordingly, the association has members from all branches of society life including: lawyers, professors, directors of famous companies, ambassadors, coaches, famous football players representatives and many other famous persons from the sport and public life.\n\nPresident of the association since its inception is the Lawyer Dragan Popovski, the Secretary-General is Gojko Stojanovski, and the selector is Jastrat Janevski. It is with special interest that we mention that the association of veterans of FK Rabotnički is first of its kind in the Republic of Macedonia. From the moment of creation, the association has shown great development of football matters, while creating and expanding upon friendly relations with other football clubs both in Macedonia and abroad.\n\nTo this end the association has established friendly sporting relations with teams from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Turkey, Greece, Slovenia, Croatia and Sweden among others.\nThe association Rabotnički Veterans is a regular participant in the traditional Albena Cup, held in Albena, Bulgaria every year. As well as in competitive games with teams in Bulgaria it has played a couple of games with teams from Romania with teams from Turkey and with teams from Serbia .\n\nAlmost with every concerned with the association have through hard work and persistence gained excellent results and helped it win numerous cups and international recognition.\n\nThe successful activity of the association continues further more. As charged and responsible inheritors of the positive changes are: Dokovski, Popovski, Lazarov, Milosevski, Zefic, M.Andreevski, G.Stojanovski, D.Stojanovski, Janevski, N.Bogoevski, S.Bogojevski, Dzipunov, Janev, Jovevski, Jugilizov, Bojcevski, Ilievski, Petkovski.\n\nThe training camp of Rabotnički is located in the city park opposite of the Toshe Proeski Arena, where Rabotnički plays its official matches in the domestic league and European competition. At the moment there are three completely renovated football fields (two with flood lighting). At the end of 2007 new facilities as a back–up for the football fields were built: containing dressing rooms, rooms for rest, a restaurant, gym and fitness area, a medical room and all sport and medical care infrastructures that are at the service of the players and support better conditions for work and better performance for the club.\n\nFK Rabotnički's home venue is Toshe Proeski Arena. Its current capacity is 36,460 spectators which puts it among 10 largest stadiums on the Balkans. The pitch is 105 x 68 m. Two big scoreboards, 18 x 6 m are installed on both East and West stands. There are 494 VIP boxes and 386 media seats, all of them on the North stand. Toshe Proeski Arena is an all-seater ground with 80% of the seats covered from inclement weather.\n\n Champions (12):\n\n Cup Winners (10):\n\n\nRabotnichki's first competitive European match was a 0–2 loss against Vorskla Poltava in the 2000–01 UEFA Cup. Krste Velkoski holds the record for most appearances in Europe for the club with 22. Also, he is a top scorer in UEFA club competitions with 6 goals. The biggest win in UEFA competition was against FC Lusitanos in the 2010–11 Europa League, defeating them by the score of 5–0, 6–0 and 11–0 on aggregate.\n\n \n\n\"As of 17 June 2019\"\n\n\nThere were two supporters groups. The supporters group Legija V was formed back in 2008. They followed the club everywhere and supported the players at every game. Before 2008 there was the group called Romantičari (formed in 2001) which was dissolved. The supporters group Debar Maalo was formed for the Macedonian. cup final vs. Makedonija GP in 2009. Since 2010 Rabotnicki doesn't have an official supporters group.\n\n"}

It is widely considered the most beautiful and the purest diamond in the world.\n\nAccording to one rumour, in 1698, a slave found the rough diamond in the Kollur Mine in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, India and hid it inside a large wound in his leg. An English sea captain stole the diamond from the slave, killed him and sold it to an Indian merchant.\n\nIn a letter to his London agent dated 6November 1701, Thomas Pitt, the Governor of Fort St. George, writes:\"... This accompanies the model of a Stone I have lately seene; it weighs Mang. 303 and carr 426. It is of an excellent christaline water without any fowles, only att{sic} one end in the flat part there is one or two little flaws which will come out in cutting, they lying on the surface of the Stone, the price they ask for it is prodigious being two hundred thousand pag. tho I believe less than one (hundred thousand) would buy it\"\n\nPitt claimed he acquired the diamond from the eminent Indian diamond merchant Jamchund for 48,000 pagodas in the same year, so it is sometimes also known as the Pitt Diamond. He dispatched the stone to London hidden in the heel of his son Robert's shoe aboard the East Indiaman \"Loyal Cooke\", which left Madras on 9October 1702. It was later cut in London by the diamond cutter Harris, between 1704 and 1706. The cutting took two years and cost about £5,000\n\nRumours circulated that Pitt had fraudulently acquired the diamond, leading satirist Alexander Pope to pen the following lines in his \"Moral Essays\"\n\"Asleep and naked as an INDIAN lay\nAn honest factor stole a gem away;\nHe pledged it to the Knight, the Knight had wit,\nSo kept the diamond, and the rogue was bit.\"\nPitt bought the diamond for £20,400 (), and had it cut into a cushion brilliant.\n\nAfter many attempts to sell it to various Members of European royalty, including Louis XIV of France, it was purchased by the French Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, in 1717 for £135,000 (), at the urging of his close friend and famed memoirist Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon. The stone was set into the crown of Louis XV for his coronation in 1722 and then into a new crown for the coronation of Louis XVI in 1775. It was also used to adorn a hat belonging to Marie Antoinette. In 1791, its appraised value was £480,000 ().\n\nIn 1792, during the revolutionary furore in Paris, \"Le Régent\", or the regent diamond, was stolen along with other crown jewels of France, but was later recovered. It was found in some roof timbers in an attic in Paris. The diamond was used as security on several occasions by the Directoire and later the Consulat to finance the military expenses: 1797-1798 it was pledged to the Berlin Entrepreneur Sigmund Otto Joseph von Treskow and 1798-1801 to the Dutch Banker Vandenberg in Amsterdam. In 1801 the gem was permanently redeemed by Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nNapoleon used it for the pommel of his sword, designed by the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet and Marie-Etienne Nitot. In 1812 it appeared on the Emperor's two-edged sword, which was a work of Nitot. Napoleon's second wife, Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, carried the Régent back to Austria upon his exile. Later her father returned it to the French Crown Jewels. The diamond was mounted successively on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Napoleon III.\n\nToday, mounted in a Greek diadem designed for Empress Eugenie, it remains in the French Royal Treasury at the Louvre. It has been on display there since 1887. Experts have estimated the Regent Diamond value to be near £48,000,000. At the current 2016 exchange rate of $1.28 USD / £1, the Regent Diamond value is estimated at $61,440,000 USD.\n\nDue to numerous scandals, and the misfortune of those who have been in possession of the stone, the Regent Diamond is said to be cursed.\n\n\n"}

On some versions, particularly on the Wave Swingers, the rotating top of the carousel also tilts for additional variations of motion.\n\nSwing rides were present at the earliest amusement parks. At Idora Park in Oakland, California, in 1908, the ride was called the Flying Swing, but appears to be the same principle.\n\nThe Chair-O-Planes premiered in Germany in 1972, designed by Zierer and built by Franz Schwarzkopf, brother of Anton Schwarzkopf. In 1974 the first portable unit debuted under the same partnership. Since then Zierer has built about 200 units. Other manufacturers have followed creating their own versions of the Chair-O-Planes including Zamperla, Chance Rides, Grover Watkins, Bertazzon, Preston & Barbieri, Vekoma and Sanoyas Hishino Meisho.\n\nIn the late 2000s, Austrian manufacturer Funtime developed the world's first tower swinger known as the Star Flyer. Mondial followed with their WindSeeker resulting in a lawsuit between the two companies.

Liseberg is the home of a Swing ride named \"\"Slänggungan\"\".\n\nLoudoun Castle Theme Park in Scotland claimed that its moon-shaped ride, \"The Plough\", was the largest Chair-O-Plane in the world. The Plough was originally called Apollo 14 and was owned by the Bembom family, operating in their Ponypark Slagharen in the Netherlands during the late seventies. It had gondolas travelling around the outside of the ride. When moved to Dreamland in England (then called \"Bembom Brothers\"), it was reconstructed into a Chair-O-Plane and named Heatwave. Leaving Dreamland, it opened in Lightwater Valley in 1998 where it operated until 2003 when Henk Bembom moved Heatwave to his new park, Loudoun Castle, where it was renamed \"The Plough\" and painted green. The park has been closed since 2010.\n\nUntil 2016 there was a Chair-O-Plane ride at Alton Towers in Staffordshire. Called Twirling Toadstool it was set in a fantasy themed area of the park called Cloud Cukoo Land, it was themed as a giant mushroom. This was formerly themed as a prehistoric dinosaur-type ride and located in an area called Ug Land.\n\nYou can also find a Chair-O-Plane at Carters Steam Fair which is one of the largest vintage travelling funfairs including some steam driven rides. Their ride's past is a little patchy but is thought to have been built in Germany in the 1920s and imported to Britain with a blank canvas. It's generally the case that British roundabouts run clockwise, whereas their Continental and American counterparts run anti-clockwise. The Chair-o-Plane certainly runs the right direction to be a British-built ride, but it may have been adapted by an early owner. \n\nAdventure Island has a Chair-O-Plane called Archelon, which was themed to the extinct species of turtle of the same name.\n\nChessington World of Adventures is home to a monkey-themed Chair-O-Planes, named the 'Monkey Swinger', that squirts water at riders.

{"id": "2139040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139040", "title": "The World (Descartes)", "text": "The World (Descartes)\n\nThe World, also called Treatise on the Light (French title: \"Traité du monde et de la lumière\"), is a book by René Descartes (1596–1650). Written between 1629 and 1633, it contains a nearly complete version of his philosophy, from method, to metaphysics, to physics and biology.\n\nDescartes espoused mechanical philosophy, a form of natural philosophy popular in the 17th century. He thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny \"corpuscles\" of matter. Corpuscularianism is closely related to atomism. The main difference was that Descartes maintained that there could be no vacuum, and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. \"The World\" presents a corpuscularian cosmology in which swirling vortices explain, among other phenomena, the creation of the Solar System and the circular motion of planets around the Sun.\n\n\"The World\" rests on the heliocentric view, first explicated in Western Europe by Copernicus. Descartes delayed the book's release upon news of the Roman Inquisition's conviction of Galileo for \"suspicion of heresy\" and sentencing to house arrest. Descartes discussed his work on the book, and his decision not to release it, in letters with another philosopher, Marin Mersenne.\n\nSome material from \"The World\" was revised for publication as \"Principia philosophiae\" or \"Principles of Philosophy\" (1644), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. In the \"Principles\" the heliocentric tone was softened slightly with a relativist frame of reference. The last chapter of \"The World\" was published separately as \"De Homine\" (\"On Man\") in 1662. The rest of \"The World\" was finally published in 1664, and the entire text in 1677.\n\nBefore Descartes begins to describe his theories in physics, he introduces the reader to the idea that there is no relationship between our sensations and what creates these sensations, thereby casting doubt on the Aristotelian belief that such a relationship existed. Next he describes how fire is capable of breaking wood apart into its minuscule parts through the rapid motion of the particles of fire within the flames. This rapid motion of particles is what gives fire its heat, since Descartes claims heat is nothing more than just the motion of particles, and what causes it to produce light.\n\nAccording to Descartes, the motion, or agitation, of these particles is what gives substances their properties (i.e. their fluidity and hardness). Fire is the most fluid and has enough energy to render most other bodies fluid whereas the particles of air lack the force necessary to do the same. Hard bodies have particles that are all equally hard to separate from the whole.\n\nBased on his observations of how resistant nature is to a vacuum, Descartes deduced that all particles in nature are packed together such that there is no void or empty space in nature (however, Descartes makes it clear that he does not claim that a void cannot exist in nature, since he lacks the observations necessary to say this with certainty).\n\nDescartes describes substances as consisting only of three elementary elements: fire, air and earth, from which the properties of any substance can be characterized by its composition of these elements, the size and arrangement of the particles in the substance, and the motion of its particles.\n\nThe motion of these particles and all other objects in nature are subject to the laws of motion Descartes had observed:\n\n\nDescartes in \"Principles of Philosophy\" added to these his laws on elastic collision.\n\nDescartes elaborates on how the universe could have started from utter chaos and with these basic laws could have had its particles arranged so as to resemble the universe we observe today. Once the particles in the chaotic universe began to move, the overall motion would have been circular because there is no void in nature, so whenever a single particle moves, another particle must also move to occupy the space where the previous particle once was. This type of circular motion, or vortex, would have created what Descartes observed to be the orbits of the planets about the sun with the heavier objects spinning out towards the outside of the vortex and the lighter objects remaining closer to the center. To explain this, Descartes used the analogy of a river that carried both floating debris (leaves, feathers, etc.) and heavy boats. If the river abruptly arrived at a sharp bend, the boats would follow Descartes third law of motion and hit the shore of the river since the flow of the particles in the river would not have enough force to change the direction of the boat. However, the much lighter floating debris would follow the river since the particles in the river would have sufficient force to change the direction of the debris. In the heavens, it’s the circular flow of celestial particles, or aether, that causes the motion of the planets to be circular.\n\nAs to the reason why heavy objects on Earth fall, Descartes explained this through the agitation of the particles in the atmosphere. The particles of the aether have greater agitation than the particles of air, which in turn have greater agitation than the particles that compose terrestrial objects (e.g. stones). The greater agitation of the aether prevents the particles of air from escaping into the heavens, just as the agitation of air particles forces terrestrial bodies, whose particles have far less agitation than those of air, to descend towards the world.\n\nWith his laws of motion set forth and the universe operating under these laws, Descartes next begins to describe his theory on the nature of light. Descartes believed that light traveled instantaneously - a common belief at the time – as an impulse across all the adjacent particles in nature, since Descartes believed nature was without a void. To illustrate this, Descartes used the example of a stick being pushed against some body. Just as the force which is felt at one end of the stick is instantly transferred and felt at the other end, so is the impulse of light that is sent across the heavens and through the atmosphere from luminous bodies to our eyes. Descartes attributed light to have 12 distinct properties:\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n"}

He excelled at tennis and cricket and was also a hunter.\n\nVizzy organised his cricket team in 1926 and constructed a ground in his palace compounds. He recruited players from India and abroad. When MCC cancelled the tour of India in 1930–31 owing to political problems, he organised a team of his own and toured India and Ceylon. He succeeded in drafting Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe for the team, a considerable feat as Hobbs had previously refused offers for five such tours. Vizzy brought Learie Constantine to India a few years later. He brought Mushtaq Ali to Benares for training when he was still a high school student. \"If Vizzy had been content with being such a cricket sponsor\", writes Mihir Bose in \"A History of Indian Cricket\", \"like Sir Horatio Mann in the eighteenth century, or Sir Julien Cahn in the twentieth, his name would be one of the most revered in Indian cricket. But he was consumed with the ambition to be a great cricketer\".\n\nThe organisation of the 1930–31 tour gave Vizzy a standing in Indian cricket that was second only to the Maharaja of Patiala. About this time, Patiala fell out with Lord Willingdon, the viceroy of India, and Vizzy got close with the viceroy. He donated a pavilion named after the viceroy in the newly constructed Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi. When the national championship was started in 1934, he attempted to donate a gold 'Willingdon trophy' but Patiala beat him to it with his Ranji Trophy.\n\nHis wealth and contacts brought him great influence in Indian cricket, even though his cricketing abilities were not great. In the early thirties, he offered to pay the board fifty thousand rupees, forty thousand of it for the Indian tour of England in 1932. He was appointed as the 'deputy vice captain' for the tour but withdrew ostensibly on reasons of health and form.\n\nVizzy finally was named the captain of the team that toured England in 1936, a post that he secured after lobbying and manipulation. Unfortunately, his desperately poor captaincy on the field resulted in even the normally reserved British press commenting on it. Some of the senior players in the squad, including Lala Amarnath, C. K. Nayudu and Vijay Merchant, were critical of Vizzy's playing abilities and captaincy, and the team was split between those who supported and those who criticised the captain.\n\nThe low point in the tour occurred during India's match against Minor Counties at Lord's. Lala Amarnath had been nursing a back injury during the game. Vizzy had Amarnath pad up, but didn't put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury. Amarnath was finally put in to bat at the end of the day. Visibly angry after returning to the dressing room, he threw his kit into his bag and muttered in Punjabi, \"I know what is transpiring\". Vizzy took this as an affront, and conspired with team manager Major Jack Brittain-Jones to have Lala Amarnath sent back from the tour without playing the First Test. It is also alleged that in the First Test against the England, Vizzy offered Mushtaq Ali a gold watch to run out Vijay Merchant.\n\nWhile India lost the series easily, Vizzy was knighted by King Edward VIII in the King's Birthday Honours. He was the only cricketer to have a knighthood bestowed on him while an active Test cricketer, shortly after his Test debut in June of that year, and prior to his last Test in August of that year. Vizzy renounced his knighthood in July 1947, explaining in a letter to Lord Mountbatten that the knighthood \"will not be in keeping with the ideals of Republican India\". MCC awarded him a membership without putting him through the customary waiting list.\n\nVizzy fared poorly in the post-tour enquiry especially in his treatment of Amarnath. In January 1937, the Beaumont Committee report described his captaincy as \"disastrous\". It stated that \"\"he did not understand field placings or bowling changes and never maintained any regular batting order.\"\" On team selection, the report stated that \"\"the good players remained idle for weeks together.\"\" The report found Amarnath not guilty of any of the charges alleged by Vizzy and Major Jones, and completely exonerated him.\n\nVizzy never played another cricket match for India again.\n\nVizzy maintained a low profile thereafter for almost two decades. He made a comeback as a cricket administrator and was the President of BCCI from 1954–1957. As the vice-president of the BCCI in 1952, he had played a role in bringing back Lala Amarnath as the Indian captain. He successfully promoted Uttar Pradesh's cricketing profile, making Kanpur a centre for Test cricket. On his invitation, C. K. Nayudu, at the age of 61, captained Uttar Pradesh in the 1956–57 season. He worked for the development of cricket in South India and was asked to be President of Mysore cricket association. He was the Vice Chairman of the All India Council of Sports.\n\nFrom the 1948–49 series against West Indies, Vizzy became a radio commentator and was the guest commentator for BBC during the Indian tour of England in 1959. He was not a particularly good commentator. According to Dickie Rutnagur, when Vizzy had just finished describing how he had hunted tigers, Rohan Kanhai responded: \"Really? I thought you just left a transistor radio on when you were commentating and bored them to death.\"\n\nHe was awarded Padma Bhushan, in 1958\n\nVizzy was the member of the Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh in 1960 and 1962. The Benares University conferred him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1944. He died on 2 December 1965, just short of his 60th birthday, in Benares (now Varanasi), considered holy by Hindus.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2139078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139078", "title": "Swansea railway station", "text": "Swansea railway station\n\nSwansea railway station serves the city of Swansea, south Wales. It is measured from London Paddington (via Stroud) on the National Rail network.\n\nIt is the fourth-busiest station in Wales (after Cardiff Central, Cardiff Queen Street and Newport).\n\nThe station opened in 1850. It was built by the South Wales Railway, which amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1863, but it was not originally on the South Wales Railway main line, planned to connect London with the port of Fishguard, and Swansea passengers had to change at Landore, two miles to the north until at least 1879. The station has been renovated and extended several times in its lifetime - most notably in the 1880s, when the stone-built office block facing High Street, on the west side of the station, was added, and in 1925-7 when the platforms were lengthened. The present-day frontage block, facing Ivey Place, was completed in 1934. Nothing now remains of the original wooden station with its two platforms and galvanised iron roof.\n\nThe majority of the rebuilt station remains intact, although the facilities have been reduced. The umbrella-type platform roofing which replaced the 1880s train-sheds in the 1920s is mostly intact although the canopy on platform 4 has been shortened. The number of platforms was reduced from five to four in 1973 under British Rail when the old Platform 1 was eliminated, along with the loading bays and fish dock that once stood beyond it. The remaining platforms were renumbered at the same time, so that what were platforms 2 to 5 are now platforms 1 to 4, respectively. On the east side of the station there was a connecting line which bypassed the platforms and ran at one time to coal tips on the North Dock (closed in 1929 and subsequently infilled) and on to a junction with the high-level line from Eastern Depot to Victoria station (closed in 1965). Part of the route of this line, alongside the station itself, is now a staff car park and the remainder, which was carried on viaducts alongside the Strand, has been obliterated by modern development. High Street goods station was on the west side of the line, just north of the passenger station. The site has been completely cleared and used for housing and also the dedicated bus road that runs from the Landore park-and-ride facility into the city centre. On the opposite side of the line were extensive carriage sidings (\"Maliphant sidings\"), large areas of which are, as of 2014, being redeveloped as the Hitachi IEP (Intercity Express Programme) rail service depot.\n\nThere was great competition between the different railway companies in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Swansea had seven stations in 1895, owned by five different railway companies: High Street (GWR), St Thomas (Midland Railway), East Dock (GWR), Riverside (Rhondda & Swansea Bay Railway, by which it was called simply Swansea; renamed Swansea Docks by the GWR in 1924 and Riverside two years later), Victoria and Swansea Bay (both London & North Western Railway), and Rutland Street (the town terminus of the Mumbles Railway). Only High Street now remains in the city centre.\n\nTo the east, trains operate along the South Wales Main Line. Swansea is a western terminus for Great Western Railway InterCity 125 services to London Paddington that do not terminate at Cardiff Central, with the majority of local train services west of Swansea timed to connect with London services. Transport for Wales provides the Swanline service to Cardiff Central (for connections to the South Wales Valleys, , , , , , and ), and services to Manchester Piccadilly.\n\nTo the west, Transport for Wales trains run along the West Wales line to Carmarthen and then to Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven or Fishguard Harbour. Certain services to Fishguard Harbour connect with the Stena Line ferry to Rosslare Europort in Ireland.\nSwansea is the eastern terminus for a few of the services from West Wales. Services on the Heart of Wales line between Llanelli and Shrewsbury often start from Swansea.\n\nSome of Transport for Wales' boat trains to and from Fishguard Harbour commence at Swansea. These connect with the Stena Line ferry to Rosslare Europort in Ireland with a daily morning and evening service in both directions. This route has been in existence since 1906.\n\nThe station is a terminus, at the end of a short branch off the South Wales Main Line and the West Wales line, so that all through passenger trains must either reverse at Swansea or omit calling there. In practice, almost all passenger services do call there.\n\nThe station has four platforms. Great Western Railway trains from London normally enter the station with the standard-class carriages leading, and usually use platform 2. The platforms are covered for part of their length.\n\nUntil January 2004, the mail train to London was a regular service from the station.\n\nIn February 2013, Swansea station won the \"Wales’ Best Staffed Train Station\" award, supported by Keep Wales Tidy.\n\nIn May 2013, Swansea station was named \"International Station of the Year\" and won the \"Best Large Station\" award at the International Station Awards.\n\nThe ticket office is open here each day (Monday - Friday 05:15 - 20:00, Saturday 06:15 - 20:00, Sunday 08:00 - 20:00), with self-service ticket machines provided for use when the ticket office is closed and for collecting pre-paid tickets. A range of other amenities are available, including toilets, retail outlets, waiting rooms, ATM, payphone and the local Tourist Information Office. Bus stops and a taxi rank are located outside the entrance. Train running information is offered via timetable posters, digital CIS displays and automated announcements. Step-free access is available to all platforms.\n\nSwansea has four platforms, numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4. Platforms are generally used for the same services, but can change if it is not available. The normal pattern is the following:\n\n\nFor most of its history the station was known as \"Swansea High Street\" to distinguish it from other stations in the area. Following the Beeching cuts in the 1960s and the closure of Swansea Victoria, the name was shortened to \"Swansea\". Today the station is called \"Abertawe/Swansea\" on platform signs, the facade, public timetables, by the National Assembly of Wales and by Swansea County Council. Before the station was re-vamped, a sign above the station entrance said \"High Street Station\", as does Network Rail route documentation.\n\nSwansea station received an upgrade in the form of redevelopment work that was completed in 2012, with new facilities including new waiting rooms, bicycle racks and digital information boards. Work was completed in June 2012 and officially opened by the Welsh Government Minister with responsibility for Transport, Carl Sargeant, on Monday 11 June.\n\nFurther redevelopment work was carried out in the form of a new Ticket Office, completed in September 2017. A new enclosure was constructed for the ticket office, separating it from the main station concourse.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2139138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139138", "title": "Kite buggy", "text": "Kite buggy\n\nA kite buggy is a light, purpose-built vehicle powered by a traction kite (power kite). It is single-seated and has one steerable front wheel and two fixed rear wheels. The driver sits in the seat located in the middle of the vehicle and accelerates and slows down by applying steering manoeuvres in coordination with flying manoeuvres of the kite. This activity is called kite buggying. The speed achieved in kite buggies by skilled drivers can range up to around 110 km/h (70 mph), hence protective clothing, including a safety helmet, is commonly worn.\n\nThe kite buggy was probably invented in China around the 13th century. It was promulgated by George Pocock (inventor) in the UK in 1827 and kite buggies were available commercially in US and UK in the late 1970s. Peter Lynn is generally attributed with the modern popularization of buggies and kite buggying with his introduction of strong, lightweight, affordable buggies in the early 1990s.\n\nKite buggying is similar to land yachting, windsurfing or even yachting, and therefore much of its terminology and technique has been adopted from these activities. Kite buggies are classified as \"Class 8 Land Yachts \" by FISLY and kite buggying competitions are often based on established land yachting guidelines.\n\nThe kite buggy's rear wheels are mounted at the ends of the rear axle. The front wheel is mounted in the front fork. In advanced buggy designs either or both front and rear wheels can be attached via suspension mechanisms.\n\nThe front fork is not unlike a bicycle's fork apart from proportions and the fact that there is no handle bar at the top. Instead there are two foot rests sticking out, on the left and right of it, attached to the fork very low down, near where the wheel is mounted. These foot rests have two main purposes:\n\nFoot rests can be fitted with foot straps and grip tape to prevent the feet from sliding off the rests during extreme buggying action. Foot straps are not recommended for beginners, due to the possibility that they will not be able to remove their feet from the pegs if the buggy flips over and therefore risk breaking their ankles.\n\nThe seat of the buggy is a bucket style seat giving the pilot good side and back support. This is necessary as the driver has to transfer the force of the used traction kite into the buggy.\n\nThe buggy is powered by a traction kite, controlled by the pilot. The traction kite is normally not directly attached to the buggy. Instead it is—through its lines and handles—either held by the pilot or attached to the pilot by a harness and strop line. The kite is used to accelerate the buggy and also assists in braking.\n\nThe buggy itself does not have any dedicated braking system that would apply a braking force directly to the wheels.\n\nThe geometry and measurements of a buggy's frame determine what kind of buggying activities it is best suited for.\n\nLonger buggies are generally more stable on a straight line whereas shorter buggies tend to be more nimble when cornering. A wider rear axle will make the buggy more resistant against accidentally toppling over. However, intentional trick riding, e.g. on only two wheels (the front and one of the rear wheels), is more difficult. Rear axles will generally be in the range of about 1.0 to 1.5 metres. Shorter or longer measures are possible for more extreme applications.\n\nPossible styles of wheels vary from very thin (like a speed-sail's wheels) over standard size (like a wheelbarrow's) to very large, also known as \"big foot\". Wheels are not constructed with exposed bare spokes (like bicycle wheels are) because this would put the buggy driver's hands and kite handles at risk of getting caught in the wheel.\n\nThe different types of wheels are used in different terrain conditions and buggying activities. A few examples include:\n\nThe buggy's (and pilot's) mass has a considerable impact on its handling. A very light buggy is more agile and quicker to manoeuvre. A heavier buggy does not slide sideways as easily, enabling it to transfer higher lateral kite forces into the ground via friction. This allows the use of higher powered kites which can propel the buggy to higher speeds.\n\nTo increase the usable kite force, a buggy can be equipped with additional weights. These weights will be attached to the buggy as low down as possible to keep the overall centre of gravity low. Also possible is filling some of the buggy frame's usually hollow tubes with a dense substance such as lead.\n\nSome buggies allow for attaching a second buggy using a specialized kind of trailer coupling.\n\nBuggies joined up like this can be powered by a single kite controlled by the pilot in the first buggy. This allows the passenger in the second buggy to be simply pulled along passively.\n\nAlternatively, a tandem kite configuration can be flown where both front and rear buggy pilots steer a separate and independent kite each. This requires very skilled pilots and good communication between them.\n\nIn addition to the traditional 3-wheeled buggy there are designs applying 4 wheels—with a more complex steering mechanism. Even 2-wheeled buggies exist—with only one single wheel at the back instead of the common 2-wheel rear axle.\n\nSome buggies can be equipped with ice skating blades replacing the wheels for use on ice or cut-down skis for use on snow.\n\nOne of the more extreme manifestations of the sport is buggy jumping. This involves the pilot being physically attached—which is not the case for the other, more moderate kite buggying activities—to the buggy by means of a lap belt and the use of relatively large kites.\n\nThe pilot flies the kite overhead to generate maximum lift and is then—with the buggy—hoisted up to tens of feet into the air. Very advanced pilots even perform aerial manoeuvres such as 360° (or more) spins, sidewinders, pendulum swings and reverse landings.\n\nKite buggying and other traction kite activities can be classified as extreme sports. Wind is the only power source and is often very unpredictable. An attitude of caution and respect towards the wind is essential, for the novice just as well as the advanced pilot.\n\nCommon advice is to start with a relatively small kite in relatively low wind conditions (e.g. 2 to 3 m² kites in winds of force 2 to 3 bft) and progress to bigger kites or higher wind conditions as ability improves. Novices should first achieve and practice full control over their kite before considering the next step, the actual kite buggying.\n\nPerforming the sport, the kite buggy pilot has to always act responsibly and make sure to not harm bystanders or cause damage to the environment or property. Choosing a kiting location with enough space is crucial for this.\n\nAll possible safety precautions should be taken: protective clothing and an adequate helmet are a must. Helmets to be considered are downhill mountain bike helmets with chin guard (light, well ventilated, good field of vision) or paragliding helmets (light, relatively well ventilated, good field of vision). True motorbike helmets are often considered less suitable as they are relatively heavy and the field of vision can be impaired (when kite buggying, both the kite itself and the terrain around the buggy should be easily visible).\n\nA frequent cause of accidents is flying a kite too large for the wind conditions and experience of the pilot. In such a case buggy and pilot tend to be pulled downwind, often skidding and sliding sideways with a high risk of the pilot entirely losing control of kite and buggy. This can be avoided by flying kites small enough so that they allow the pilot to safely stop the buggy by turning it through the wind and driving upwind.\n\nPilots are encouraged to obtain 3rd party liability insurance as there is a risk of coming into contact with bystanders or each other. Such insurance is available through the various national and regional organisations like the South and West Association of Traction Kiting (SWATK) or the British Power Kitesports Association (BPKA).\n\nResponsible shops should strongly discourage newcomers from buying very powerful kites without instruction. They should also offer or help organising tuition for novice pilots, ideally through PKSF-accredited instructors.\n\nAs with all kite-flying activities, the kiting code of conduct applies.\n\n\nGetting Started Guides related to Kite Buggying.\n"}

The stadium is owned by the Municipal Prefecture of São Paulo. The stadium was inaugurated on 27 April 1940, in the presence of the Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas, the intervener Adhemar de Barros and the mayor of São Paulo, Prestes Maia. The stadium holds 40,199 people and its pitch dimensions are 104 m of length by 70 m of width.\n\nThe stadium is named after Paulo Machado de Carvalho. He was the 1958 FIFA World Cup Brazilian delegation chief, the founder of Rede Record, one of the largest television networks in Brazil and was known as \"\"Marechal da Vitória\"\" (\"Marshal of Victory\").\n\nPacaembu is frequently used to host home matches of the \"Big 4\" football clubs of the State of São Paulo, of which Corinthians, Palmeiras and São Paulo are based in the capital city itself, and only Santos is based in a different city. This occurs when the clubs must cede their own stadiums for concerts, or when reforms are being made. In the case of Santos, Pacaembu is also used when the club requires a site with a higher seating capacity for a particular match, given the low capacity of their own stadium.\n\nThe first match ever played at Pacaembu Stadium took place on 27 April 1940, when Palestra Italia (Palestra Italia was Palmeiras' original name) and Coritiba. Palestra Italia beat Coritiba 6–2. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Coritiba's Zequinha. After this match, another match was played, where Corinthians beat Atlético Mineiro 4–2. Both matches were from Taça Cidade de São Paulo's cup.\n\nOn 4 May 1940, the Taça Cidade de São Paulo Final was played. Palestra Italia beat Corinthians 2–1, being the first club to win a competition at Pacaembu Stadium.\n\nThe stadium's attendance record currently stands at 71,281 people, set on 24 May 1942 when Corinthians and São Paulo drew 3–3.\n\nOn 20 September 1942, Palmeiras played its first match after changing its name (the previous name was Palestra Italia). Palmeiras beat São Paulo 3–1, winning that year's Campeonato Paulista.\n\nIn 1945, the stadium's largest score was set, when São Paulo beat Jabaquara 12–1.\n\nIn 2005, the stadium served as the first \"Pit Stop\" of \"The Amazing Race 9\".\n\nOn 11 May 2007, the pope Benedict XVI met with the youth of Brazil as a part of his Apostolic Journey to Brazil on the occasion of the Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThroughout its history, Corinthians played most of their home matches at Pacaembu until the opening of Arena Corinthians in 2014, given that their original stadium couldn't receive official football matches by the lack of necessary requirements.\n\nBetween July 2010 and November 2014, the stadium was the temporary home ground of Palmeiras while the Estádio Palestra Itália was demolished and replaced by the Allianz Parque.\n\nSeveral 1950 FIFA World Cup matches were played at Estádio do Pacaembu, which were:\n\n\nOn 29 September 2008, the Museu do Futebol (Museum of Football) was inaugurated.

He was the 1989 Heisman Trophy winner as a quarterback for the University of Houston. He was the first African American quarterback to receive this honor. In the 1990 NFL Draft, Ware was the first round selection (#7 overall) of the Detroit Lions. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nWare grew up in the Galveston, Texas region, hoping to play football at the University of Texas. He said \"I was going to Texas. All they had to do was lie to me and tell me I was going to play quarterback once I got there. Thank goodness they told me the truth [that] they were going to move me to defense\". After graduating from Dickinson High School, Ware instead played at the University of Houston, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1989, along with the Davey O'Brien Award, the latter award given to the most outstanding college quarterback of the year. That year, his junior year, he threw for 4,699 yards, 44 touchdowns, and set 26 NCAA records. Many of the records were thanks to the innovative use of the run and shoot offense, which his successor, David Klingler, also used to great effect. The Cougars ended the season ranked the #14 team in the nation by the Associated Press. He then declared for the NFL Draft, foregoing his senior year.\n\nWare was made the #1 draft pick of the Detroit Lions when head coach Wayne Fontes overrode the advice of the team's scouting director, who resigned the next day. Ware joined the Lions for the 1990 season, teaming with the previous Heisman Trophy winner from 1988, Barry Sanders. Ware spent four years with Detroit, playing 14 games and starting six: Wayne Fontes insisted on starting the oft-injured Rodney Peete, and usually replacing Peete with Erik Kramer when Peete was hurt or played poorly. Fontes generally only played Ware when the Lions were out of the playoffs or already losing a game by a wide margin. Ware's best stretch came late in the 1992 season when the Lions were out of the playoffs: he won two of three games. He began 1994 on the roster of the Los Angeles Raiders, but was released after several games. In 1995, he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars, one of the NFL's two expansion teams that year. As a former Heisman Trophy winner, Ware's presence gathered much local excitement in Jacksonville, but ultimately, Ware was cut from the team the week before the regular season began.\n\nIt is debated why Ware failed in the NFL despite a prolific college career. While some have argued that he was never given a fair chance to develop by his coaches, others have noticed that he was unable to adapt to an offensive system other than the run and shoot offense at Houston.\n\nWare also played in the Canadian Football League with the Ottawa Rough Riders, the BC Lions and the Toronto Argonauts (where he backed up fellow Heisman winner Doug Flutie), and five games with the Berlin Thunder, a German NFL Europe team.\n\nSince 2002, Ware has been a part of the Houston Texans' radio broadcast team. He is teamed up with Marc Vandermeer.\n\nIn 2003, Ware became a college football analyst for ESPN. From 2003 until 2008, he called games on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN on ABC. In July 2009, ESPN announced that Ware would team up with long-time SEC broadcaster Dave Neal in the fall of 2009 as color commentator for ESPN Regional Television's coverage of Southeastern Conference Football. Ware continued in this role until 2013, and since 2014 has been an analyst for ESPN's SEC Network.\n\nIn 2004, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. On February 29, 2012, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Other members of his class include Texas A&M University Women's basketball Coach Gary Blair, Shawn Andaya, University of Texas Football Coach Mack Brown, Fred Couples, Coach Lovie Smith, G.A. Moore.

The subscriber local loop from the telco central office are almost all two wire for analog baseband voice calls (and some digital services like ISDN), and converted to four-wire at the line card back when telephone switching was performed on baseband audio. Today the audio is digitized and processed completely in the digital domain upstream from the local loop.\n\nThe reason for using two wires rather than four is simple economics--half the materials cost half as much to purchase and install. Note the use of the past-tense \"cost,\" as installation of two-wire copper local loops for telephony was done primarily during the mid 20th century. In the first world there is no new infrastructure planning for new copper-based technology, and as customers are migrating to cellular telephony and high-speed Internet, wireline carriers are abandoning their copper local loops, tearing out the copper and replacing it with fiber-optic cable and/or selling the rights-of-way to third parties for private use. In developing nations, wireless communications are considered to be the most cost-effective from an infrastructure perspective. Two-wire circuits in new installations are limited to intercom and military field telephone applications, though these too are being supplanted by modern digital communication modes.\n\nTo communicate in both directions in the same wire pair, conversion between four-wire and two-wire was necessary, both at the telephone and at the central office. A hybrid coil accomplishes the conversion for both. At the central office, it is part of a four-wire terminating set, more often as part of a line card. A modern line card has no two-to-four wire conversion whatsoever; it is strictly an analog/digital interface to a system that has a completely digital and integrated signal path internally. Using actual wires to circuit switch a telephone call became obsolete when the crossbar switch (a mechanical system) was replaced by 4ESS electronic switches in the 1970s by the Bell System in the US. The old telephone hybrids of yore have been replaced by inexpensive IC chip-based components that perform the same functions at greatly reduced cost. When personal computing and the Internet became popular at the end of the 20th century, the inductive load of traditional hybrids became a liability for computer modem users, and remaining loading coils in subscriber lines were scrapped.\n\nDifferent countries have different standards for telephone impedance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2139191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139191", "title": "Breast pain", "text": "Breast pain\n\nBreast pain is the symptom of discomfort in the breast. Pain that involves both breasts and which occurs repeatedly before the menstrual period is generally not serious. Pain that involves only one part of a breast is more concerning. It is particular concerning if a hard mass or nipple discharge is also present.\nCauses may be related to the menstrual cycle, birth control pills, hormone therapy, or psychiatric medication. Pain may also occur in those with large breasts, during menopause, and in early pregnancy. In about 2% of cases breast pain is related to breast cancer. Diagnosis involves examination, with medical imaging if only a specific part of the breast hurts.\nIn more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment. Otherwise treatments may include paracetamol or NSAIDs. A well fitting bra may also help. In those with severe pain tamoxifen or danazol may be used. About 70% of women have breast pain at some point in time. Breast pain is one of the most common breast symptoms, along with breast masses and nipple discharge.\n\nCyclical breast pain is often associated with fibrocystic breast changes or duct ectasia and thought to be caused by changes of prolactin response to thyrotropin. Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with menstruation and/or premenstrual syndrome (PMS).\n\nNoncyclical breast pain has various causes and is harder to diagnose. Noncyclical pain has frequently its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in puberty (both in girls and boys), in menopause and during pregnancy. After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by breastfeeding. Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include alcoholism with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), mastitis and medications such as digitalis, methyldopa (an antihypertensive), spironolactone, certain diuretics, oxymetholone (an anabolic steroid), and chlorpromazine (a typical antipsychotic). Also, shingles can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.\n\nSome women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear breast cancer. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer. The great majority of breast cancer cases do not present with symptoms of pain, though breast pain in older women is more likely to be associated with cancer.\n\nDiagnosis involves breast examination, with medical imaging if only a specific part of the breast hurts. Medical imaging by ultrasound is recommended for all ages, well in those over 30 it is recommended together with mammography.\n\nRuling out the other possible causes of the pain is one way to differentiate the source of the pain. Breast pain can be due to:\nMedications can be associated with breast pain and include:\n\nDiagnostic testing can be useful. Typical tests used are mammogram, excisional biopsy for solid lumps, fine-needle aspiration and biopsy, pregnancy test, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nIn more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment. Otherwise treatments may include paracetamol or NSAIDs. A well fitting bra may also help. In those with severe pain tamoxifen or danazol may be used.\n\nBromocriptine may be used as well.\n\nSpironolactone, low dose oral contraceptives, and low-dose estrogen have helped to relieve pain. Topical anti-inflammatory medications can be used for localized pain. Vitamin E is not effective in relieving pain nor is evening primrose oil. Vitamin B and vitamin A have not been consistently found to be beneficial. Flaxseed has shown some activity in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia.\n\nPain may be relieved by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or, for more severe localized pain, by local anaesthetic. Pain may be relieved by reassurance that it does not signal a serious underlying problem, and an active life style can also effect an improvement.\n\nInformation regarding how the pain is real but not necessarily caused by disease can help to understand the problem. Counseling can also be to describe changes that vary during the monthly cycle. Women on hormone replacement therapy may benefit from a dose adjustment. Another non-pharmacological measure to help relieve symptoms of pain may be to use good bra support. Breasts change during adolescence and menopause and refitting may be beneficial. Applying heat and/or ice can bring relief. Dietary changes may also help with the pain. Methylxanthines can be eliminated from the diet to see if a sensitivity is present. Some clinicians recommending a reduction in salt, though no evidence supports this practice.\n\n"}

Marcos for the Interim \"Batasang Pambansa\" (National Assembly), and was his political vehicle during his rule. It was reorganized as a political party in 1986.\n\nSince 1986, the KBL has contested in most of the national and local elections in the Philippines but retained a single seat in the House of Representatives in Ilocos Norte, which was held by former First Lady Imelda Marcos until 2019.\n\nThere was confusion in the 2007 election campaign within the party which stems from the recent endorsement (allegedly by the KBL) of Marcos loyalist lawyer Oliver Lozano to dubious senatorial candidate Joselito Pepito \"Peter\" Cayetano, who was the namesake of Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano, an opposition stalwart. Rep. Cayetano said that Gov. Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., who is the president of the KBL, has certified that Joselito Cayetano has no party affiliation whatsoever with the KBL and that no endorsement was called for his namesake's candidacy. Subsequently, Marcos has denounced loyalist lawyer and senatorial candidate Oliver Lozano along with his candidates for turning the KBL into an \"embarrassment\". Marcos said that the party leadership would deal with the \"renegade members\" of the KBL after the elections.\n\nOn November 20, 2009, the KBL forged an alliance with the Nacionalista Party (NP) between Bongbong Marcos and NP Chairman Senator Manny Villar at the Laurel House in Mandaluyong. Bongbong was later on removed as a member by the KBL National Executive Committee on November 23. As such, the NP broke its alliance with the KBL due to internal conflicts within the party, though Bongbong remained part of the NP Senatorial line-up.\n\n\n\n"}

It purports to trace the life, illusions and disillusions of Dom Manuel, Count of Poictesme (a fictional province of France), and of his physical and spiritual descendants through many generations.\n\nThe conceit of the series is that the life (or at least the expectations) of Dom Manuel 'the Redeemer', which is the subject of the novel \"Figures of Earth\", did not end in his death but was continued in his heirs. The life of each follows the same pattern.\n\n\"The comedy is always the same. In the first act, the hero imagines a place where happiness exists. In the second, he strives towards that goal. In the third, he comes up short, or what amounts to the same thing: he achieves his goal only to find that happiness lies a little further down the road.\"<br>\n--\"\" (1923)\n\nThe components of the \"Biography\" were written between 1901 and 1929; some of them were originally conceived before Cabell had thought of Manuel and had to be rewritten to a greater or lesser extent to enable them to fit into the sequence. Although the \"Biography\" is a mix of fantasies, historical romances, social satires, verse, plays, and essays, Cabell said that he considered it a single work.\n\nA table of works comprising the \"Biography\" follows. These data are given for each title:\n\nSome of Cabell's other books appear to have teasing references to the \"Biography\". For example, the hero of \"Hamlet Had an Uncle\" (1927, B27) is the historical prince Horwendill, whose name suggests Manuel's nemesis, Horvendile.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2139204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139204", "title": "PDP–Laban", "text": "PDP–Laban\n\nThe Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan (), more commonly known as PDP–Laban, is the ruling political party in the Philippines.\n\nThe party now known as PDP–Laban is the result of a merger between the \"Partido Demokratiko Pilipino\" and Lakas ng Bayan.\n\nPartido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP) was founded on February 6, 1982 in Cebu City by Aquilino \"Nene\" Pimentel Jr. and a group of protesters against the authoritarian government of Ferdinand Marcos, the 10th President of the Philippines, and the then-ruling Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL). These protesters included the leaders of Davao City and Cagayan de Oro City, such as Zafiro L. Respicio, Rey Magno Teves, Cesar R. Ledesma, Samuel Occeña, Crispin Lanorias and Mords Cua.\n\nBy 1983, PDP had formed a coalition with Lakas ng Bayan (Tagalog for \"People's Power\"), the party founded by former Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. in 1978.\n\nIn 1986, the two groups merged to form the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan or PDP–Laban. During that period, PDP–Laban became the single biggest opposition group to run against the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 snap presidential election. Corazon Aquino, the widow of the assassinated senator Benigno Aquino Jr., became the party's nominee to run for President. Aquino was persuaded to run by businessman, newspaperman and street parliamentarian Joaquin Roces, who was convinced that Aquino would have the biggest chance to defeat Marcos in the polls.\n\nRoces started the \"Cory Aquino for President\" movement to gather one million voters in one week to urge Aquino to run for president. However, another opposition group led by Senator Salvador Laurel of Batangas was also participating in the election, with Laurel being its presidential bet. Before the election, Aquino approached Laurel and offered to give up her allegiance to the PDP–Laban party and run as president under Laurel's United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) party. Laurel later approached Aquino, offering her only the vice-vresidential nomination of UNIDO (or Unity). In the end, Laurel became the vice-presidential running-mate of Aquino, after being convinced to do so by the Archbishop of Manila, Jaime Cardinal Sin.\n\nPDP–Laban then aligned itself with UNIDO, which became the main group and leader of the coalition which opposed Marcos. After the People Power Revolution of 1986, which saw Aquino and Laurel proclaimed President and Vice President respectively, PDP–Laban continued its alliance with UNIDO until the latter's dissolution in 1987. In 1988, PDP–Laban was split into two factions: the Pimentel Wing led by Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. and the Cojuangco Wing led by Jose Cojuangco, Jr.. The Cojuangco Wing and the Lakas ng Bayan party of House Speaker Ramon Mitra, Jr. merged in 1988 to form the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino party.\n\n PDP–Laban is headed by its president, senator Aquilino \"Koko\" Pimentel III, after the then incumbent Vice-President of the Philippines, Jejomar Binay, resigned as party chairman and left the party. Binay later created United Nationalist Alliance or UNA.\n\nThe party is currently re-grouping, and there are some movements of expansion especially in Mindanao, where it originated, particularly in the Davao region. Two of the party's founders, Crispin Lanorias and Cesar Ledesma, are again active in recent party activities. After the 2016 elections, PDP–Laban signed a coalition agreement with the Nacionalista Party, Lakas-CMD, National Unity Party and the Nationalist People's Coalition, witnessed by then President-elect Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nImmediately after the May 2016 elections, several representatives from other parties moved to PDP–Laban, notably: Geraldine Roman (Bataan), Alfred Vargas (Quezon City), and Ansaruddin Adiong (Lanao del Sur). The party's presence in the House of Representatives eventually grew from three members in the 16th Congress, to 123 members in the current 17th Congress. By April 2018, 300,000 politicians had joined the party, according to Koko Pimentel. \n\nReacting to the influx of new members, party founder Nene Pimentel urged members to question the motivations of new incoming politicians and ensure they are interested in the party's ideals. He stated that these new members might only be interested in identifying with the current administration, in order to boost their chances of winning in the upcoming 2019 elections.\n\nPDP–Laban plans to learn from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is set to send some of its members to the CCP's school in Fujian for \"policy training\" to learn more on how the party is organized. The Filipino party also established ties with United Russia, Russia's ruling party, on October 2017. PDP–Laban has also expressed interest in sending a delegation to the Workers' Party of Korea, which is the ruling party of North Korea. A four-member delegation is set to meet with the North Korean party in July 2018.\n\nOn July 23, 2018, the same day as Duterte's third State of the Nation Address, an internal leadership dispute within the House of Representatives' majority resulted in former President and current Pampanga representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo becoming Speaker of the lower house, replacing Pantaleon Alvarez. The resolution was adopted that same night with 184 voting in favor and 12 abstaining. Arroyo was previously a member of Lakas-CMD, before switching to PDP–Laban in 2017.\n\nSome representatives, including Deputy Speaker Rolando Andaya (Camarines Sur), are eyeing to shift towards other political parties after Arroyo's ascendance to the House's leadership. Andaya also said that some lawmakers might join Lakas-CMD, Arroyo's former party, and merge with Sara Duterte-Carpio's Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP). Duterte-Carpio denied rumors that members of PDP–Laban were seeking to move into HNP, which is a regional party based in Davao Region.\n\nSucceeding these events, a faction sought to unseat PDP–Laban's high-ranking officials. Willy Talag, president of the party's Makati City council and chair of the membership committee of the NCR Chapter, said during an assembly of the party on July 27 that PDP–Laban's current leaders have committed violations, including holding mass oath taking of members “without proper basic seminar” and swearing in officials that are “involved in illegal drugs.\" The faction elected Rogelio Garcia and Talag as party president and chairman, respectively, removing Senator Aquilino \"Koko\" Pimentel III and Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez from their respective positions. Koko Pimentel dismissed the election of new leaders, disowning the group and assembly, and called the event an \"unofficial, unauthorized, rogue assembly using the name of PDP-Laban\". Sen. Pimentel, who has personally dismissed the election, together with PDP–Laban vice chairman and Department of Energy Sec. Alfonso Cusi, and Rep. Alvarez have notified members that the supposed national assembly was not officially sanctioned by the party. Special Assistant to the President Bong Go said in an interview with CNN Philippines that Duterte is set to meet the two factions, in an effort to unite the party.\n\nMonths later, on November 30, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) released a statement recognizing Pimentel's group as the legitimate leadership of PDP–Laban. Following this, Pimentel has said that his faction will not recognize candidates from the Garcia wing. In a move branded as an 'ideology flip-flop', the party endorsed Imee Marcos as one of its senatorial candidates. Marcos, who has been implicated on numerous graft and corruption cases, is the daughter of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, whose authoritarian regime sparked the establishment of PDP–Laban and the party's democratic revolution against the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nAccording to self-published material, PDP-LABAN seeks a peaceful and democratic way of life characterized by \"freedom, solidarity, justice, equity, social responsibility, self-reliance, efficiency and enlightened nationalism\". It has touted as its five guiding principles the following: theism, authentic humanism, enlightened nationalism, democratic socialism, and consultative and participatory democracy.\n\nThe party advocates a transition to a federal, semi-presidential parliamentary form of government from the current unitary presidential system through a revision of the present 1987 Constitution of the Philippines.\n\nFrom the 1980s, the 'Laban' or 'L' sign was a hand gesture used by the party, along with other members of the UNIDO coalition, which originally supported Corazon Aquino. This was done by raising the thumb and index finger over the forehead, forming a letter \"L' shape. This was popularized during the People Power Revolution. During the campaign and presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, the Laban sign fell into disuse within PDP-Laban and was replaced with the \"Duterte fist\", which was the hand symbol popularized by Rodrigo Duterte. The \"Duterte fist\" was later included in the party's current logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1891 and nicknamed \"the Robins\", they are currently members of and play at Moss Lane.\n\nAltrincham was established by a Sunday school around 1891 as Rigby Memorial Club. They soon merged with another local team, Grapplers, to form Broadheath Football Club, and were founder members of the Manchester League in 1893. Their first match in the league on 16 September 1893 saw them lose 7–0 to Hulme, and they went on to lose 14 of the remaining league matches as they finished bottom of the table.\n\nAfter playing at various grounds in Broadheath, Timperley and Altrincham, the club moved to Pollitt's Field in 1903, at which point they changed their name to Altrincham. They won the Cheshire Amateur Cup in their first season under the new name, and went on to win both the Manchester League and the Cheshire Senior Cup the following season. They won the Manchester League again in 1906–07, and moved to their current Moss Lane ground in 1910. \n\nIn 1911 the club joined Division Two of the Lancashire Combination. They finished as runners-up in their first season in the division, only missing out on the title on goal average and earning promotion to Division One. They remained in Division One until World War I. When football resumed in 1919, the club were founder members of the Cheshire County League, where they remained until World War II, the highlights being finishing as runners-up in 1934–35 and 1935–36 and a League Cup win in 1932–33. In 1934–35 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 at Gainsborough Trinity.\n\nAfter missing out the 1945–46 season, they rejoined the Cheshire County League in 1946, achieving little success until the 1960s, when Altrincham director Noel White hired Freddie Pye as manager. A key turning point in the history of the club is often cited as the signing of Jackie Swindells in 1965, who in his first full season (1965–66) scored 82 goals. helping Altrincham to the first of back-to-back Cheshire County League titles, scoring over 120 goals in the league in both seasons. After finishing as runners-up in 1967–68, they were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968.\n\nThey reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy in 1976–77, losing 2–1 to Scarborough in a second replay; the season also saw them apply for election to the Football League for the first time, but they received only 12 votes compared to the 27 received by the elected Wimbledon. The following season they went one better in the FA Trophy, reaching the Wembley final, where they beat Leatherhead 3–1. In 1978–79 they finished as runners-up in the Northern Premier League and applied for election to the Football League again. Although they finished as the top non-League club in the ballot, they received only 13 votes to the 37 received by Halifax Town, the lowest-placed Football League club. Instead, Altrincham became founder members of the Alliance Premier League, the top level of non-League football, the winner of which would be the sole non-League nomination for future Football League election ballots.\n\nThe league's inaugural season saw Altrincham crowned champions. In the subsequent elections to the Football League, the club missing out by a single vote, receiving 25 to Rochdale's 26; this was considered especially unfortunate as the club had been promised the votes of Grimsby Town and Luton Town, but the Grimsby representative was prevented from voting by being in the wrong part of the meeting room, whilst the Luton representative arrived too late after a mix-up over the start time. \n\nAltrincham retained the APL title the following season, but again failed in the Football League elections, this time only receiving 15 votes to the 41 received by Halifax, who were again the lowest ranked Football League club. The next two seasons saw the club finish in mid-table, together with another FA Trophy final appearance in 1981–82, this time losing 1–0 to Enfield. This was followed by four consecutive top-five finishes between 1984 and 1987 and a second FA Trophy win in 1985, beating Runcorn 1–0 in the final. The 1985–86 season saw them record one of the biggest FA Cup giant-killings of all time when they defeated top division Birmingham City 2–1 at Birmingham's St Andrew's. \n\nThe club then returned to mid-table with occasional successful seasons, finishing third in 1990–91 (by which time the league had become the Football Conference) and fourth in 1994–95. After finishing bottom of the Conference in 1996–97 the club were relegated to the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League. An eighth-place finish in 1997–98 saw them return to the Conference two seasons later as Premier Division champions. However, they lasted only a single season in the Conference as they finished second-from-bottom and were relegated back to the Northern Premier League. \n\nA twelfth-place finish in 2003–04 saw them qualify for the newly formed Conference North. They finished fifth in the new division in its first season, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After defeating Nuneaton Borough 4–2 on penalties following a 1–1 draw and then Kettering Town 3–2, they were promoted to the Conference National division with a 2–1 win over Eastbourne Borough in the North/South final played at the Britannia Stadium.\n\nIn 2005–06 Altrincham finished bottom of the Conference National after receiving an 18-point deduction when they were found to have fielded an ineligible player, James Robinson, for 15 matches, during which he scored six goals and Altrincham won 18 points. However, they were reprieved from relegation after Canvey Island resigned from the league and Scarborough were demoted. The following season they again finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Boston United were demoted. A third successive relegation reprieve occurred in 2007–08 when Halifax were liquidated.\n\nAfter mid-table finishes in 2008–09 and 2009–10 and Ricky Ponting becoming a shareholder of the club in 2009, Altrincham were relegated to the Conference North at the end of the 2010–11 season. In 2012–13 a fourth-place finish saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost 4–2 on aggregate to Brackley Town. However, after finishing fourth the following season, they beat Hednesford Town 4–3 on aggregate in the semi-finals and then defeated Guiseley 2–1 in the final to earn promotion back to the Conference National. In 2015–16 the club finished in the relegation zone and were relegated to the renamed National League North. The following season they finished bottom of the National League North, leading to a second successive relegation to the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League. However, the 2017–18 season saw the club win the Northern Premier League title, earning promotion back to the National League North.\n\nIn 2018–19 Altrincham finished fifth in the National League North, earning a place in the play-offs; in the quarter finals, they drew 2–2 with Blyth Spartans before winning 7–6 in a penalty shootout, setting up a semi-final tie with Chorley, which they lost 3–1 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.\n\nAltrincham have a history of giant-killing in the FA Cup, holding the record of knocking out more Football League sides than any other club that has spent its entire history playing in non-League. They reached the third round of the FA Cup in four consecutive seasons between 1978–79 and 1981–82, holding a better record in the competition than any club playing in the Third or Fourth divisions during this period.

Herring\n\nClyde LaVerne Herring (May 3, 1879September 15, 1945), an American politician and Democrat, served as the 26th Governor of Iowa, and then one of its U.S. Senators, during the last part of the Great Depression and the first part of World War II.\n\nHe was born in 1879 and raised in Jackson County, Michigan, where he attended public schools. His parents farmed until he was 14 years old, when the Panic of 1893 caused failing finances that made it necessary for them to move to town.\n\nIn 1897, at 18, he moved to Detroit, Michigan and became a jewelry clerk.\n\nEnlisting in the military, he served during the Spanish–American War as a private in Company D of the Third Michigan Regiment.\n\nAfter the war, he moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he engaged in ranching from 1902 to 1906. He then moved to Massena, Iowa, where he farmed for two years (1906–1908).\n\nAs \"Time Magazine\" would recount in a 1935 cover story featuring him, \"in Detroit he had fixed Henry Ford's watch, thus came to know that rising automobile manufacturer. From 1910 until the distributing system was reshuffled after the War, Clyde Herring was Ford agent for Iowa. By that time he had acquired $3,000,000 worth of Des Moines real estate.\"\n\nIn 1916–17, he served with the Iowa National Guard on the Mexican border. Returning to civilian life in Des Moines, as America entered the First World War, Herring led local fundraising efforts as the chair of the Greater Des Moines Committee, and he was invited to Washington to advise the federal government on speeding up production of war supplies.\n\nHerring was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor of Iowa in 1920, losing to Republican Nathan E. Kendall, and for the United States Senate in a 1922 special election, losing to Republican Smith W. Brookhart. He held one of Iowa's seats on the Democratic National Committee from 1924 to 1928.\n\nIn 1932, Herring ran again for Governor of Iowa, now against incumbent Republican Daniel Webster Turner. Herring and other Democratic candidates in Iowa won an unprecedented number of races that year, and Herring became only the second Democrat to serve as Governor of Iowa since the founding of the Republican Party, in 1854. In a 1934 rematch, Herring again defeated Turner while he led a Democratic sweep of statewide offices that kept Democrats in six of Iowa's nine U.S. House seats.\n\nIn 1936, his fourth year as governor, Herring chose not to run for re-election but instead challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Senator L. J. Dickinson. Herring defeated Dickinson by fewer than 36,000 votes. Both senators from Iowa were Democrats for the first time since 1855. His service as senator was slightly delayed to await the end of his term as Iowa's governor.\n\nHerring's reaction to Orson Welles' 1938 \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast received national attention. To protect listeners, he urged adoption of federal legislation \"inducing\" broadcasters to first submit radio programming to the Federal Communications Commission before it could be aired. He declared that \"radio has no more right to present programs like that than someone has to come knocking on our door and screaming.\" However, neither he nor anyone else presented a bill, and no such legislation was adopted.\n\nAt the 1940 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Herring aspired to be picked as Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice-presidential candidate, but Roosevelt and the Convention instead nominated fellow Iowan Henry A. Wallace, who had served as Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture.\n\nHerring served only a single term as senator and failed in his first re-election bid. Roosevelt's popularity in Iowa had waned after 1936, and Democratic candidates increasingly lost re-election. In addition, disagreements or rivalries between Herring and other leading Iowa Democrats, including fellow Senator Guy M. Gillette, former governor Nelson G. Kraschel, and Vice-President Henry Wallace, hampered party unity. Herring was defeated by Iowa's Republican Governor, George A. Wilson. Herring was the last of the successful 1932 Democratic candidates in Iowa to lose a re-election bid.\n\nAfter serving in the Senate, he returned to the automobile business and was named by Roosevelt as the assistant administrator of the Office of Price Administration, the wartime price regulatory agency.\n\nHerring died in Washington, D.C., on September 15, 1945. He is interred at the Glendale cemetery in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n"}
{"id": "2139214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139214", "title": "Hormonal IUDs", "text": "Hormonal IUDs\n\nIntrauterine system (IUS) with progestogen, sold under the brand name Mirena among others, is an intrauterine device that releases the hormone levonorgestrel into the uterus. It is used for birth control, heavy menstrual periods, and to prevent excessive build of the lining of the uterus in those on estrogen replacement therapy. It is one of the most effective forms of birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0.2%. The device is placed in the uterus and lasts three to seven years. Fertility often returns quickly following removal.\nSide effects include irregular periods, benign ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, and depression. Rarely uterine perforation may occur. Use is not recommended during pregnancy but is safe with breastfeeding. The IUD with progestogen is a type of long-acting reversible birth control. It works by thickening the mucus at the opening of the cervix, stopping the buildup of the lining of the uterus, and occasionally preventing ovulation.\nThe IUD with levonorgestrel was first approved for medical use in 1990 in Finland and in the United States in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$122.46 each. In the United Kingdom they cost the NHS about £88. In the United States they cost around US$844.00, More than 120 countries have approved the device and it is used by more than 10 million women.\n\nIn addition to birth control, hormonal IUD are used for prevention and treatment of:\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nAfter insertion, Mirena is officially sold as effective for up to five years, although several studies have shown that it remains effective through seven years. It is approved for use up to seven years in Europe. Kyleena is approved for five years and Skyla is approved for three years.\n\nThe hormonal IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive, and is considered one of the most effective forms of birth control. The first year failure rate for the hormonal IUD is 0.1-0.2% and the five-year failure rate is 0.7-0.9%. These rates are comparable to tubal sterilization, but unlike sterilization the effects of the hormonal IUD are reversible.\n\nThe hormonal IUD is considered to be more effective than other common forms of reversible contraception, such as the birth control pill, because it requires little action by the user after insertion. The effectiveness of other forms of birth control is mitigated (decreased) by the users themselves. If medication regimens for contraception are not followed precisely, the method becomes less effective. IUDs require no daily, weekly, or monthly regimen, so their typical use failure rate is therefore the same as their perfect use failure rate.\n\nIn women with bicornuate uterus and in need of contraception, two IUDs are generally applied (one in each horn) due to lack of evidence of efficacy with only one IUD. Evidence is lacking regarding progestogen IUD usage for menorrhagia in bicornuate uterus, but a case report showed good effect with a single IUD for this purpose.\n\nProgestogen-only contraceptives such as an IUD are not believed to affect milk supply or infant growth. However, a study in the Mirena application for FDA approval found a lower continuation of breastfeeding at 75 days in hormonal IUD users (44%) versus copper IUD users (79%).\n\nWhen using Mirena, about 0.1% of the maternal dose of levonorgestrel can be transferred via milk to the\nnursed infant.\nA six-year study of breastfed infants whose mothers used a levonorgestrel-only method of birth control found the infants had increased risk of respiratory infections and eye infections, though a lower risk of neurological conditions, compared to infants whose mothers used a copper IUD. No longer-term studies have been performed to assess the long-term effects on infants of levonorgestrel in breast milk.\n\nThere are conflicting recommendations about use of Mirena while breastfeeding. The U.S. FDA does not recommend any hormonal method, including Mirena, as a first choice of contraceptive for nursing mothers. The World Health Organization recommends against immediate postpartum insertion, citing increased expulsion rates. It also reports concerns about potential effects on the infant's liver and brain development in the first six weeks postpartum. However, it recommends offering Mirena as a contraceptive option beginning at six weeks postpartum even to nursing women. Planned Parenthood offers Mirena as a contraceptive option for breastfeeding women beginning at four weeks postpartum.\n\nA hormonal IUD should not be used by women who:\n\nInsertion of an IUD is not recommended for women having had a D&E abortion (second-trimester abortion) within the past four weeks. To reduce the risk of infection, insertion of an IUD is not recommended for women that have had a medical abortion but have not yet had an ultrasound to confirm that the abortion was complete, or that have not yet had their first menstruation following the medical abortion.\n\nA full list of contraindications can be found in the WHO \"Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use\" and the CDC \"United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use\".\n\n\nAccording to a 1999 evaluation of the studies performed on progestin-only birth control by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there is some evidence that progestin-only birth control reduces the risk of endometrial cancer. The IARC concluded that there is no evidence progestin-only birth control increases the risk of any cancer, though the available studies were too small to be definitively conclusive.\n\nProgesterone is a hormone in the endometrium that counteracts estrogen driven growth. Very low levels of progesterone will cause estrogen to act more, leading to endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. These effects can be minimized if treated with progestin, but not in very many cases.\n\nEstrogen and progesterone have an antagonistic relationship. Estrogen promotes the growing of endometrial lining, while progesterone limits it. In the case of endometrial cancer, progesterone can negatively regulate estrogen driven growth. Tumors formed are correlated with insufficient progesterone and excess estrogen. In patients with endometrial cancer who use progestin releasing IUDs concluded mixed results.\n\nNo evidence has been identified to suggest Mirena affects bone mineral density (BMD). Two small studies, limited to studying BMD in the forearm, show no decrease in BMD. One of the studies showed at seven years of use, similar BMD at the midshaft of the ulna and at the distal radius as nonusers matched by age and BMI. In addition, BMD measurements were similar to the expected values for women in the same age group as the participants. The authors of the study said their results were predictable, since it is well established that the main factor responsible for bone loss in women is hypoestrogenism, and, in agreement with previous reports, they found estradiol levels in Mirena users to be normal.\n\nThe hormonal IUD is a small 'T'-shaped piece of plastic, which contains levonorgestrel, a type of progestin.\nThe cylinder of the device is coated with a membrane that regulates the release of the drug.\nBayer markets Skyla as Jaydess in the United Kingdom. Jaydess releases six micrograms per day and lasts for three years. In comparison, oral contraceptives can contain 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel.\nThe hormonal IUD releases the levonorgestrel directly into the uterus, as such its effects are mostly paracrine rather than systemic. Most of the drug stays inside the uterus, and only a small amount is absorbed into the rest of the body.\n\nThe hormonal IUD is inserted in a similar procedure to the nonhormonal copper IUD, and can only be inserted by a qualified medical practitioner. Before insertion, a pelvic exam is performed to examine the shape and position of the uterus. A current STI at the time of insertion can increase the risk of pelvic infection. However, routine screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia prior to insertion is not recommended. If a person needs screening and there is no evidence of infection on examination or has been previously screened, insertion of the IUD does not need to be delayed.\n\nDuring the insertion, the vagina is held open with a speculum, the same device used during a pap smear. A grasping instrument is used to steady the cervix, the length of the uterus is measured for proper insertion with a uterine sound for decreasing chance of uterine perforation with the IUD, and the IUD is placed using a narrow tube through the opening of the cervix into the uterus. A short length of monofilament plastic/nylon string hangs down from the cervix into the vagina. The string allows physicians and patients to check to ensure the IUD is still in place and enables easy removal of the device. Mild to moderate cramping can occur during the procedure, which generally takes five minutes or less. Insertion can be performed immediately postpartum and post-abortion if no infection has occurred.\nMisoprostol is not effective in reducing pain in IUD insertion.\n\nRemoval of the device should also be performed by a qualified medical practitioner. After removal, fertility will return to previous levels relatively quickly.\nOne study found that the majority of participants returned to fertility within three months.\n\nLevonorgestrel is a progestogen, i.e. progesterone-receptor agonist. The hormonal IUD's primary mechanism of action is to prevent fertilization. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system has several contraceptive effects, although thickening of the cervical mucus appears to be the primary effect. Other effects include making the inside of the uterus becomes fatal to sperm and thinning of the endometrial lining, but this is not the usual function.\n\nOvulation is not inhibited.\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that IUDs primarily prevent fertilization, not implantation. In one experiment involving tubal flushing, fertilized eggs were found in half of women not using contraception, but no fertilized eggs were found in women using IUDs.\nIUDs also decrease the risk of ectopic pregnancy, which further implies that IUDs prevent fertilization.\n\nHormonal IUDs were developed in the 1970s following the development of the copper IUD in the 1960s and 1970s. Dr. Antonio Scommenga, working at the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, discovered that administering progesterone inside the uterus could have contraceptive benefits. With knowledge of Scommegna's work, a Finnish doctor, Jouni Valtteri Tapani Luukkainen, created the 'T'-shaped IUD that released progesterone, marketed as the Progestasert System in 1976. This IUD had a short, 1-year lifespan and never achieved widespread popularity. Following this relative lack of success, Dr. Luukkainen replaced the progesterone with the hormone levonorgestrel to be released over a five-year period, creating what is now Mirena.\n\nThe Mirena IUD was studied for safety and efficacy in two clinical trials in Finland and Sweden involving 1,169 women who were all between 18 and 35 years of age at the beginning of the trials. The trials included predominantly Caucasian women who had been previously pregnant with no history of ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease within the previous year. Over 70% of the participants had previously used IUDs.\n\nIn 2013 Skyla, a lower dose levonorgestrel IUD effective for up to three years, was approved by the FDA. Skyla has a different bleeding pattern than Mirena, with only 6% of women in clinical trials becoming amenorrheic (compared to approximately 20% with Mirena).\n\nIn 2009, Bayer, the maker of Mirena, was issued an FDA Warning Letter by the United States Food and Drug Administration for overstating the efficacy, minimizing the risks of use, and making \"false or misleading presentations\" about the device. From 2000 to 2013, the federal agency received over 70,072 complaints about the device and related adverse effects. As of April 2014, over 1,200 lawsuits have been filed in the United States.\n\n"}
{"id": "2139226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139226", "title": "Ordinal arithmetic", "text": "Ordinal arithmetic\n\nIn the mathematical field of set theory, ordinal arithmetic describes the three usual operations on ordinal numbers: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit well-ordered set which represents the operation or by using transfinite recursion. Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals. In addition to these usual ordinal operations, there are also the \"natural\" arithmetic of ordinals and the nimber operations.\n\nThe union of two disjoint well-ordered sets \"S\" and \"T\" can be well-ordered. The order-type of that union is the ordinal which results from adding the order-types of \"S\" and \"T\". If two well-ordered sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by order-isomorphic disjoint sets, e.g. replace \"S\" by {0} × \"S\" and \"T\" by {1} × \"T\". This way, the well-ordered set \"S\" is written \"to the left\" of the well-ordered set \"T\", meaning one defines an order on \"S\" formula_1 \"T\" in which every element of \"S\" is smaller than every element of \"T\". The sets \"S\" and \"T\" themselves keep the ordering they already have. This addition of the order-types is associative and generalizes the addition of natural numbers.\n\nThe first transfinite ordinal is ω, the set of all natural numbers.\nFor example, the ordinal ω + ω is obtained by two copies of the natural numbers ordered in the usual fashion and the second copy completely to the right of the first. Writing 0' < 1' < 2' < ... for the second copy, ω + ω looks like\nThis is different from ω because in ω only 0 does not have a direct predecessor while in ω + ω the two elements 0 and 0' do not have direct predecessors.\nAs another example, here are 3 + ω and ω + 3:\nAfter relabeling, the former just looks like ω itself, i.e. 3 + ω = ω, while the latter does not: is not equal to ω since has a largest element (namely, 2') and ω does not (even if ω and are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this addition is not commutative. In fact it is quite rare for α+β to be equal to β+α: this happens if and only if α=γ\"m\", β=γ\"n\" for some ordinal γ and natural numbers \"m\" and \"n\". From this it follows that \"α commutes with β\" is an equivalence relation on the class of nonzero ordinals, and all the equivalence classes are countably infinite.\n\nHowever, addition is still associative; one can see for example that (ω + 4) + ω = ω + (4 + ω) = ω + ω.\n\nThe definition of addition can also be given inductively (the following induction is on \"β\"):\n\nUsing this definition, ω + 3 can be seen to be a successor ordinal (it is the successor of ω + 2), whereas 3 + ω is a limit ordinal, namely, the limit of 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, etc., which is just ω.\n\nZero is an additive identity \"α\" + 0 = 0 + \"α\" = \"α\".\n\nAddition is associative (\"α\" + \"β\") + \"γ\" = \"α\" + (\"β\" + \"γ\").\n\nAddition is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument:\nbut the analogous relation does not hold for the left argument; instead we only have:\n\nOrdinal addition is left-cancellative: if \"α\" + \"β\" = \"α\" + \"γ\", then \"β\" = \"γ\". Furthermore, one can define left subtraction for ordinals \"β\" ≤ \"α\": there is a unique \"γ\" such that \"α\" = \"β\" + \"γ\".\nOn the other hand, right cancellation does not work:\nNor does right subtraction, even when \"β\" ≤ \"α\": for example, there does not exist any \"γ\" such that \"γ\" + 42 = ω.\n\nIf the ordinals less than α are closed under addition and contain 0 then α is occasionally called a γ-number (see additively indecomposable ordinal). These are exactly the ordinals of the form ω.\n\nThe Cartesian product, \"S×T\", of two well-ordered sets \"S\" and \"T\" can be well-ordered by a variant of lexicographical order that puts the least significant position first. Effectively, each element of \"T\" is replaced by a disjoint copy of \"S\". The order-type of the Cartesian product is the ordinal which results from multiplying the order-types of \"S\" and \"T\". Again, this operation is associative and generalizes the multiplication of natural numbers.\n\nHere is ω·2:\nwhich has the same order type as ω + ω. In contrast, 2·ω looks like this:\nand after relabeling, this looks just like ω.\nThus, ω·2 = ω+ω ≠ ω = 2·ω, showing that multiplication of ordinals is not commutative. More generally, a natural number greater than 1 never commutes with any infinite ordinal, and two infinite ordinals α, β commute if and only if α = β for some positive natural numbers \"m\" and \"n\". The relation \"α commutes with β\" is an equivalence relation on the ordinals greater than 1, and all equivalence classes are countably infinite.\n\nDistributivity partially holds for ordinal arithmetic: \"R\"(\"S\"+\"T\") = \"RS\"+\"RT\". However, the other distributive law (\"T\"+\"U\")\"R\" = \"TR\"+\"UR\" is \"not\" generally true: (1+1)·ω = 2·ω = ω while 1·ω+1·ω = ω+ω which is different. Therefore, the ordinal numbers form a left near-semiring, but do \"not\" form a ring.\n\nThe definition of multiplication can also be given inductively (the following induction is on \"β\"):\n\nThe main properties of the product are:\n\nA δ-number (see additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable) is an ordinal greater than 1 such that αδ=δ whenever 0<α<δ. These consist of the ordinal 2 and the ordinals of the form ω.\n\nThe definition of ordinal exponentiation for finite exponents is straightforward. If the exponent is a finite number, the power is the result of iterated multiplication. For instance, ω = ω·ω using the operation of ordinal multiplication. Note that ω·ω can be defined using the set of functions from 2 = {0,1} to ω = {0,1,2...}, ordered lexicographically with the least significant position first:\nHere for brevity, we have replaced the function {(0,\"k\"), (1,\"m\")} by the ordered pair (\"k\", \"m\").\n\nSimilarly, for any finite exponent \"n\", formula_9 can be defined using the set of functions from \"n\" (the domain) to the natural numbers (the codomain). These functions can be abbreviated as \"n\"-tuples of natural numbers.\n\nBut for infinite exponents, the definition may not be obvious. A limit ordinal, such as ω, is the supremum of all smaller ordinals. It might seem natural to define ω using the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. However, we find that any absolutely defined ordering on this set is not well-ordered. To deal with this issue we can use the variant lexicographical ordering again. We restrict the set to sequences which are nonzero for only a finite number of arguments. This is naturally motivated as the limit of the finite powers of the base (similar to the concept of coproduct in algebra). This can also be thought of as the infinite union formula_10.\n\nEach of those sequences corresponds to an ordinal less than formula_11 such as formula_12 and formula_11 is the supremum of all those smaller ordinals.\n\nThe lexicographical order on this set is a well ordering that resembles the ordering of natural numbers written in decimal notation, except with digit positions reversed, and with arbitrary natural numbers instead of just the digits 0–9:\n\nIn general, any ordinal \"α\" can be raised to the power of another ordinal \"β\" in the same way to get \"α\".\n\nIt is easiest to explain this using Von Neumann's definition of an ordinal as the set of all smaller ordinals. Then, to construct a set of order type \"α\" consider all functions from \"β\" to \"α\" such that only a finite number of elements of the domain \"β\" map to a non zero element of \"α\" (essentially, we consider the functions with finite support). The order is lexicographic with the least significant position first. We find\n\nThe definition of exponentiation can also be given inductively (the following induction is on \"β\", the exponent):\n\nProperties of ordinal exponentiation:\n\nWhile the same notation is used for ordinal exponentiation and cardinal exponentiation, ordinal exponentiation is quite different from cardinal exponentiation. For example, with ordinal exponentiation formula_14, but for formula_15(aleph naught, the cardinality of formula_16), formula_17. Here, formula_18 is the cardinality of the set of all functions from the set of all natural numbers to a set with two elements. (This is the cardinality of the power set of the set of all natural numbers and is equal to formula_19, the cardinality of the continuum.) To avoid confusing ordinal exponentiation with cardinal exponentiation, one can use symbols for ordinals (e.g. ω) in the former and symbols for cardinals (e.g. formula_15) in the latter.\n\nJacobsthal showed that the only solutions of α = β with α ≤ β are given by α = β, or α = 2 and β = 4, or α is any limit ordinal and β = εα where ε is an ε-number larger than α.\n\nEvery ordinal number \"α\" can be uniquely written as formula_21, where \"k\" is a natural number, formula_22 are positive integers, and formula_23 are ordinal numbers. This decomposition of \"α\" is called the Cantor normal form of \"α\", and can be considered the base-ω positional numeral system. The highest exponent formula_24 is called the degree of formula_25, and satisfies formula_26. The equality formula_27 applies if and only if formula_28. In that case Cantor normal form does not express the ordinal in terms of smaller ones; this can happen as explained below.\n\nA minor variation of Cantor normal form, which is usually slightly easier to work with, is to set all the numbers \"c\" equal to 1 and allow the exponents to be equal. In other words, every ordinal number α can be uniquely written as formula_29, where \"k\" is a natural number, and formula_30 are ordinal numbers.\n\nAnother variation of the Cantor normal form is the \"base δ expansion\", where ω is replaced by any ordinal δ>1, and the numbers \"c\" are positive ordinals less than δ.\n\nThe Cantor normal form allows us to uniquely express—and order—the ordinals \"α\" that are built from the natural numbers by a finite number of arithmetical operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation base-formula_16: in other words, assuming formula_32 in the Cantor normal form, we can also express the exponents formula_33 in Cantor normal form, and making the same assumption for the formula_33 as for α and so on recursively, we get a system of notation for these ordinals (for example, \n\ndenotes an ordinal).\n\nThe ordinal ε (epsilon nought) is the set of ordinal values α of the finite-length arithmetical expressions of Cantor normal form that are hereditarily non-trivial where non-trivial means β<α when 0<α. It is the smallest ordinal that does not have a finite arithmetical expression in terms of ω, and the smallest ordinal such that formula_36, i.e. in Cantor normal form the exponent is not smaller than the ordinal itself. It is the limit of the sequence \n\nThe ordinal ε is important for various reasons in arithmetic (essentially because it measures the proof-theoretic strength of the first-order Peano arithmetic: that is, Peano's axioms can show transfinite induction up to any ordinal less than ε but not up to ε itself).\n\nThe Cantor normal form also allows us to compute sums and products of ordinals: to compute the sum, for example, one need merely know that\n\nif formula_39 (if formula_40 one can apply the distributive law on the left and rewrite this as formula_41, and if formula_42 the expression is already in Cantor normal form); and to compute products, the essential facts are that when formula_43 is in Cantor normal form and formula_44, then \n\nand\n\nif n is a non-zero natural number.\n\nTo compare two ordinals written in Cantor normal form, first compare formula_24, then formula_48, then formula_49, then formula_50, etc.. At the first difference, the ordinal that has the larger component is the larger ordinal. If they are the same until one terminates before the other, then the one that terminates first is smaller.\n\nErnst Jacobsthal showed that the ordinals satisfy a form of the unique factorization theorem: every nonzero ordinal can be written as a product of a finite number of prime ordinals. This factorization into prime ordinals is in general not unique, but there is a \"minimal\" factorization into primes that is unique up to changing the order of finite prime factors .\n\nA prime ordinal is an ordinal greater than 1 that cannot be written as a product of two smaller ordinals. Some of the first primes are 2, 3, 5, ... , ω, ω+1, ω+1, ω+1, ..., ω, ω+1, ω+1, ... There are three sorts of prime ordinals:\n\nFactorization into primes is not unique: for example, 2×3=3×2, 2×ω=ω, (ω+1)×ω=ω×ω and ω×ω = ω. However, there is a unique factorization into primes satisfying the following additional conditions:\n\nThis prime factorization can easily be read off using the Cantor normal form as follows:\n\nSo the factorization of the Cantor normal form ordinal\ninto a minimal product of infinite primes and integers is\nwhere each \"n\" should be replaced by its factorization into a non-increasing sequence of finite primes and\n\nAs discussed above, the Cantor Normal Form of ordinals below formula_56 can be expressed in an alphabet containing only the function symbols for addition, multiplication and exponentiation, as well as constant symbols for each natural number and for formula_16. We can do away with the infinitely many numerals by using just the constant symbol 0 and the operation of successor, formula_58 (for example, the integer 4 may be expressed as formula_59). This describes an \"ordinal notation\": a system for naming ordinals over a finite alphabet. This particular system of ordinal notation is called the collection of \"arithmetical\" ordinal expressions, and can express all ordinals below formula_56, but cannot express formula_56. There are other ordinal notations capable of capturing ordinals well past formula_56, but because there are only countably many strings over any finite alphabet, for any given ordinal notation there will be ordinals below formula_63 (the first uncountable ordinal) that are not expressible. Such ordinals are known as large countable ordinals.\n\nThe operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all examples of primitive recursive ordinal functions, and more general primitive recursive ordinal functions can be used to describe larger ordinals.\n\nThe natural sum and natural product operations on ordinals were defined in 1906 by Gerhard Hessenberg, and are sometimes called the Hessenberg sum (or product) . These are the same as the addition and multiplication (restricted to ordinals) of John Conway's field of surreal numbers. They have the advantage that they are associative and commutative, and natural product distributes over natural sum. The cost of making these operations commutative is that they lose the continuity in the right argument which is a property of the ordinary sum and product. The natural sum of α and β is often denoted by α⊕β or α#β, and the natural product by α⊗β or α⨳β.\n\nThe natural operations come up in the theory of well partial orders; given two well partial orders \"S\" and \"T\", of types (maximum linearizations) \"o\"(\"S\") and \"o\"(\"T\"), the type of the disjoint union is \"o\"(\"S\")⊕\"o\"(\"T\"), while the type of the direct product is \"o\"(\"S\")⊗\"o\"(\"T\"). One may take this relation as a definition of the natural operations by choosing \"S\" and \"T\" to be ordinals α and β; so α⊕β is the maximum order type of a total order extending the disjoint union (as a partial order) of α and β; while α⊗β is the maximum order type of a total order extending the direct product (as a partial order) of α and β. A useful application of this is when α and β are both subsets of some larger total order; then their union has order type at most α⊕β. If they are both subsets of some ordered abelian group, then their sum has order type at most α⊗β.\n\nWe can also define the natural sum of \"α\" and \"β\" inductively (by simultaneous induction on \"α\" and \"β\") as the smallest ordinal greater than the natural sum of \"α\" and \"γ\" for all \"γ\" < \"β\" and of \"γ\" and \"β\" for all \"γ\" < \"α\". There is also an inductive definition of the natural product (by mutual induction), but it is somewhat tedious to write down and we shall not do so (see the article on surreal numbers for the definition in that context, which, however, uses surreal subtraction, something which obviously cannot be defined on ordinals).\n\nThe natural sum is associative and commutative. It is always greater or equal to the usual sum, but it may be greater. For example, the natural sum of ω and 1 is ω+1 (the usual sum), but this is also the natural sum of 1 and ω. The natural product is associative and commutative and distributes over the natural sum. It is always greater or equal to the usual product, but it may be greater. For example, the natural product of ω and 2 is ω·2 (the usual product), but this is also the natural product of 2 and ω.\n\nYet another way to define the natural sum and product of two ordinals α and β is to use the Cantor normal form: one can find a sequence of ordinals \nγ > … > γ \nand two sequences (\"k\", …, \"k\") and \n(\"j\", …, \"j\") of natural numbers (including zero, but satisfying \n\"k\" + \"j\" > 0 for all \"i\") such that \nand defines \n\nUnder natural addition, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the free abelian group with basis the gamma numbers ω that have non-negative integer coefficients. Under natural addition and multiplication, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the (commutative) polynomial ring generated by the delta numbers ω that have non-negative integer coefficients.\nThe ordinals do not have unique factorization into primes under the natural product. While the full polynomial ring does have unique factorization, the subset of polynomials with non-negative coefficients does not: for example, if \"x\" is any delta number, then\nhas two incompatible expressions as a natural product of polynomials with non-negative coefficients that cannot be decomposed further.\n\nThere are arithmetic operations on ordinals by virtue of the one-to-one correspondence between ordinals and nimbers. Three common operations on nimbers are nimber addition, nimber multiplication, and minimum excludance (mex). Nimber addition is a generalization of the bitwise exclusive or operation on natural numbers. The of a set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal \"not\" present in the set.\n\n\n"}

In 1889, he returned to St. Bernard's Church and served as permanent rector there until 1907.\n\nOn July 2, 1907, Feehan was appointed the second Bishop of Fall River by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 19 from Bishop Thomas Beaven, with Bishops Matthew Harkins and Michael Tierney serving as co-consecrators. During his 27-year tenure, he became known as the \"Benevolent Bishop\" and established thirty-six parishes.\n\nFeehan later died at age 78.\n\nBishop Feehan High School, a parochial school in Attleboro, was named for him when it opened in 1961.\n"}

Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state could use eminent domain to take land that was overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of private landowners and redistribute it to the wider population of private residents.\n\nOnly 22 landowners owned 72.5% of the fee simple titles in the island of Oahu, and the Hawaii State Legislature concluded that there was an oligopoly in land ownership that was \"skewing the State's residential fee simple market, inflating land prices, and injuring the public tranquility and welfare.\"\n\nHowever, the shortage of buildable land on Oahu was largely because roughly half of the island is government-owned and thus unavailable for privately-owned housing. \n\nThe Hawaii legislature enacted a condemnation scheme, which was intended to transfer titles to the lots from its owner, the Bishop Estate, to the home lessees. The case focused on the taking of land held by the Bishop Estate, a charitable trust that held the residual lands of the Hawaiian monarchy, and used the proceeds to support the Kamehameha schools, which provide an education to Hawaiian children. The Bishop Estate had subdivided some of its land on Oahu and leased individual lots to land lessees, who built homes on them and at first paid nominal rents to the estate. \n\nHowever, as Oahu land values rose, as did rents, the tenants demanded the state to acquire the Estate's title and to reconvey title to the individual lots to the lessee-homeowners, who would have to pay fair market value to reimburse the state for the acquisition.\n\nThe Court's decision looked to \"Berman v. Parker\" (1954) in which eminent domain power had been used to redevelop slum areas and for the possible sale or lease of the condemned lands for private interest.\n\nThe Court decided that the United States Congress had the power to determine what was for the public good over the judiciary. The decision equated police power with the eminent domain of the sovereign's public use requirement.\n\nIn an 8-0 decision, the Court voted that the Hawaiian act was constitutional. Hawaii's act to regulate the oligopoly was seen as a classic exercise of the State's police powers, and a comprehensive and rational approach to identifying and correcting market failure and satisfied the public use doctrine. Land did not have to be put into actual public use in order to use eminent domain. It is the taking's purpose, and not its mechanics that were important. Here, eminent domain was used to provide an overall market benefit to the wider populace.\n\nThe decision suggested that a judicial deference to the legislature was involved. If the legislature determines there are substantial reasons for the exercise of the taking power, courts must defer to the legislature's determination that the taking will serve a public use.\n\nThe Court held that the takings to correct concentrated property ownership was a legitimate public purpose.\n\nThe decision, though, placed limits on the power of the government, stating:\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the \"Midkiff\" decision failed to achieve the stated purpose of the redistribution legislation. It could not create new housing because it transferred title from the land lessor only to the lessee-homeowners who already occupied existing homes on the subject property. As soon as the former lessees acquired fee simple titles to their homes, they became attractive to Japanese investors who paid high prices for those homes, largely in the upscale Kahala and Hawaii Kai neighborhoods. That led to a ripple effect throughout the island.\n\nHome prices on Oahu, far from falling, as had been intended by the legislature, surged upward and more than doubled within six years.\n\nThe primary holding of \"Midkiff\" was reaffirmed by \"Kelo v. City of New London\" (2005).\n\n"}
{"id": "2139262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139262", "title": "Gambela, Ethiopia", "text": "Gambela, Ethiopia\n\nGambela () is a city and separate woreda in Ethiopia and the capital of the Gambela Region or \"kilil\". Located in Anuak Zone, at the confluence of the Baro River and its tributary the Jajjabe, the city has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 526 meters. It is surrounded by Gambela Zuria.\n\nGambela is important because bridges over both the Baro and the Jajjaba are located in that city. The Anuak and Nuer inhabitants of Gambela each have their own market. The town also boasts an airport (ICAO code HAGM, IATA GMB) and is near the Gambela National Park.\n\nGambela was founded because of its location on the Baro, a tributary of the Nile, which was seen by both the British and Ethiopia as an excellent highway for exporting coffee and other goods from the fertile Ethiopian Highlands to Sudan and Egypt. \n\nEmperor Menelik II of Ethiopia granted Britain use of a port along the Baro May 15, 1902, and in 1907 the port and a customs station were founded at Gambela.\n\nA shipping service run by Sudan Railways linked Khartoum with Gambela, a distance of 1,366 kilometers. According to Richard Pankhurst, by the mid-1930s boats sailed twice a month during the rainy season, taking seven days downstream and eleven upstream.\n\nAccording to Bahru Zewde, British interest in the concession was due, in part, to the attraction of ' \"tapping the allegedly fabulous commercial potential of Western Ethiopia and drawing the whole region into the economic orbit of the Sudan\" ', but also intended ' \"to be a brilliant British countermove to avert the virtual commercial hegemony in Ethiopia that the Jibouti-Addis Ababa Railway seemed to promise the French.\" ' In fact it benefitted the Abyssinians themselves not to have their economy at the control of a single European power, whether French or British or even Italian, and Menelik was playing a wise game of playing his colonial neighbours against each other, to avoid any single one gaining a monopoly, whilst opening his country to the benefits of trade and technology, as part of a major programme of modernisation. Although over 70% of Ethiopia's external trade passed through the port at Djibouti between 1911 and 1917, the share of goods passing through Gambela had the fastest rate of growth until the Italian conquest. \n\nThe British did have to cope with the Ethiopian governors of Sayo and Gore, who showed a keen interest in the money to be made in the cross-border trade. A small detachment of troops from the nominal condominium of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was posted to Gambela to maintain order and security within the concession and defend it from outside interests in what was still a largely lawless country, following numerous Egyptian, Islamist, British and Italian interventions, and a consequent breakdown of civil authority, over the previous decades.\n\nThe Regent \"Ras\" Tafari (the later Emperor Haile Selassie), beginning on 9 July 1927, granted a number of concessions to T. Zervos and A. Danalis to construct a road 180 kilometers in length to connect Gambela with the towns of Metu and Gore.\n\nThe British Concession was not directly affected by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 but when Italian East Africa was formally established in 1936, the Ethiopian concession was deemed to have lapsed. The shipping service suspended and the steamer, together with the British resident, left Gambela on 14 October. With the river traffic now gone, the Italians provided an alternative link for the town, by building a further road from Gambela, this one to Nekemte, between 1936 and 1940. Gambela was taken from the Italians by the 2/6 King's African Rifles on 3 February 1941. The property of the British buildings were reported to have been respected and left intact during the peacetime and wartime Italian administration. The original Resident returned, but the Concession was no longer distinctive, as the whole country remained under British administration, the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA), for a number of years, until sufficient Ethiopian administrators had been trained. \n\nLij Tewodros, a son of Lij Iyasu, surfaced in the Gambela area in May 1941 proclaiming himself Emperor. His insurrection was put down by Belgian Congo troops before they left the area in February 1942.\n\nA new Anglo-Ethiopian treaty was signed on 19 December 1944 which virtually eliminated British privileges, but the Gambela enclave continued. The Ethiopian government gradually increased its control over the enclave: outlawing the Maria Theresa Thaler as legal tender, requiring all merchants to obtain passports in person in Addis Ababa, and in 1951 informing the British resident, Captain Dribble, that he could no longer judge or imprison anyone. When he departed on 30 October 1954, the end of the enclave was in sight. The enclave was still held by the Sudanese when they achieved independence, but they did not agree to hand the enclave back to Ethiopia until 15 October 1956.\n\nThe port was closed during the Derg era, and it remains closed due to tension between the Sudan People's Liberation Army and the Ethiopian government, though there are hopes to reopen the port.\n\nThe Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front announced on 27 May 1991 that they had gained control of Gambela.\n\nOn 13 December 2003, in an apparent reprisal for a series of ambushes of highlander civilians, 30 Ethiopian soldiers and highlander civilians launched a brutal attack on Gambela's Anuak population. Human Rights Watch has estimated that 424 people were killed. An armed Anuak group (which John Young speculates is the Gambela People's Liberation Movement) attacked a prison in the capital 30 October 2005, freeing inmates, and killing the police commissioner.\n\nIn March 2012, a bus was attacked, with 19 people on board being shot dead.\n\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, Gambela has a total population of 39,022, an increase of 113.67% over the 1994 census, of whom 20,790 are men and 18,232 women. A total of 10,152 households were counted in this town, which results in an average of 3.8 persons to a household, and 9,595 housing units. The majority of the inhabitants said they were Protestant, with 57.04% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 30.39% of the population practised Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 9% were Muslim, and 4.08% were Catholic.\n\nAccording to the 1994 national census, its total population was 18,263 of whom 9852 were males and 8411 were females. The ethnic breakdown was 33.8% Anuak, 26.1% Oromo, 14% Nuer, 10.4% Amhara, 6.5% Tigray, 4.3% Kambaata, and 4.9% all others.\n"}

In 1999, in order to gain experience, he was loaned to Twente for one season, and was an undisputed starter for a side that finished sixth in the Eredivisie.\n\nIt would be in 2001–02 that Van der Meyde established himself as first-choice at Ajax. After a turbulent start, Ronald Koeman was instated as head coach, and the player became an integral part in the rebuilding of the team, making the right-winger position his own. The campaign ended in huge success as the Amsterdam club conquered the double, with him scoring five times in the league.\n\nIn 2002–03 Van der Meyde – playing alongside the likes of youngsters as Mido, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder, Steven Pienaar and Cristian Chivu – scored a career-best 11 goals, while also helping Ajax to the quarterfinals in the UEFA Champions League, netting in a crucial 1–1 away draw against A.S. Roma which certified the team's qualification for the knockout stages.\n\nIn the 2003 off-season, 24-year-old Van der Meyde was acquired by Inter Milan from Italy, for £4 million. However, he managed only 14 Serie A appearances in his first season, appearing slightly more in the following campaign.\n\nVan der Meyde scored a spectacular goal against Arsenal on 17 September 2003, in the Champions League group stage 3–0 away win at Highbury, as the \"Nerazzurri\" were eventually ousted in the group stages.\n\nAfter leaving Inter, strong speculation suggested Van der Meyde would return to Ajax, with additional reported interest from French club AS Monaco FC and Tottenham Hotspur in England. However, on 31 August 2005, he agreed a contract with another Premier League team, Everton, for £2 million; on 25 March 2006, in his first Merseyside derby against Liverpool, he received a straight red card for his challenge on Liverpool's Xabi Alonso, in a 1–3 away loss.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Van der Meyde proved once again to be the centre of much speculation regarding his future, having failed to properly settle at Everton and making only ten appearances in his first season thanks to a combination of injuries and rumours of alcoholism. He staunchly denied any such allegations and reaffirmed his commitment in June 2006, stating \"I want to stay, I am desperate to stay. I love it here. Everything suits my game. I'm happy in England and I want to show everyone that I can really play football. If I get the chance next season, I will do it.\"\n\nVan der Meyde was admitted to hospital in the early hours of 7 August 2006, with breathing problems. It was claimed that his drink had been spiked whilst in a bar in Liverpool. He was fined by Everton for breach of discipline and, to further add to a miserable week, his house was burgled during a friendly with Athletic Bilbao five days later: his Ferrari, Mini Cooper, and dog were amongst the items stolen. The cars and pet dog were later found, although the Ferrari had its windscreen smashed. In March 2007, the player accused manager David Moyes of telling 'downright lies' in regard to his fitness, but apologised afterwards.\n\nIn July 2007, Van der Meyde played a full 90 minutes in Coleraine, Northern Ireland. In arguably his most successful pre-season at the club, he went on to complete several friendly matches in an attempt to gain fitness ahead of the new domestic league campaign. However, he further cast a doubt over his Everton future by failing to turn up for a scheduled training session.\n\nOn 17 August 2007, Van der Meyde was suspended following a 'breach of club discipline' because he had failed to appear at training, being fined two weeks' wages for a total of £50,000. The player appealed for \"understanding from the club and fans\" due to the personal situation he was facing, with his five-month-old daughter Dolce not being allowed to leave the hospital since her birth due to illness; following this, he did not make an appearance for the main squad for over a year, being limited to just reserve team football.\nVan der Meyde returned to first-team football on 7 December 2008, playing five minutes for an injury-hit Everton side in a 2–3 home defeat to Aston Villa. The following month, he was brought on as a substitute in the FA Cup fourth round replay against Liverpool, providing the assist to Dan Gosling's winning strike in the 118th minute; he was released in June 2009, after his contract expired.\n\nVan der Meyde spent six months unattached before agreeing a short-term deal with PSV Eindhoven in March 2010. On 23 April he made his debut for the club in a 3–0 friendly win over VVV-Venlo, but failed to appear officially during his stint.\n\nIn late February 2011, Van der Meyde retired from professional football at the age of 31. However, in December, he returned to action and joined Topklasse amateurs WKE based in Emmen, until the end of the season.\n\nOn 19 May 2002, Van der Meyde was handed his debut for Dick Advocaat's Dutch national team against the United States, which he marked with a goal in a 2–0 win. He helped the country reach the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2004, featuring in four games – all starts – and assisting Ruud van Nistelrooy in the 1–1 group stage draw to Germany, but being overlooked for the last-four match against Portugal.\n\nAfter the tournament, following Marco van Basten's appointment as national team manager and the emergence of youngsters as Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Rafael van der Vaart, Van der Meyde failed to receive another callup, finishing his international career with 17 caps.\n\nVan der Meyde was married, a relationship from which he had two daughters.\n\nIn November 2012, following the publication of his biography \"Geen genade\" (English: \"No Mercy\"), Van der Meyde gave a series of media interviews, including with \"The Times\" in England, in which he admitted to a long term series of personal problems: after a difficult first year in Milan he spent a long time on the bench in his second year, and began drinking. Offered the chance to join AS Monaco at the end of the season his wife, who liked to keep animals, rejected the prospect of living in an apartment, so he moved to Everton. Injured upon arriving, he played regularly for a period after regaining fitness, before getting injured against Manchester United; in rehabilitation for six months, after his newly born daughter was hospitalised for an equal period, he again turned to alcohol.\n\nIn his second year at Everton, Van der Meyde's wife and daughters returned to the Netherlands to enable his youngest child to gain more hospital treatment with family support. He then began an affair, which after denying this for a period to his wife, was discovered after she paid a private detective to follow him; this resultantly lead to his divorce, and also a break-up with his girlfriend.\n\nAfter having his contract terminated with Everton at the end of the fourth season due to recurring injury, personal problems, and falling out with manager David Moyes, Van der Meyde stayed resident in Liverpool for a year. Moving in with a friend he began a downward spiral of drink, excessive gambling and drug taking, including cocaine.\n\nRealising his now depressive state, Van der Meyde agreed with his agent to return to Amsterdam, who negotiated a training agreement with former club Ajax. This allowed him to turn around his life, and regain contact with his ex-wife and daughters.\n\nOn 24 May 2014, Van der Meyde refereed the Lingerie World Cup, which the Netherlands won on home soil.\n\nAjax\n\nInter\n\n"}

He probably lived in the 2nd century AD, although nothing is known about his life. He is the author of \"The Handbook of Platonism\", an epitome of Middle Platonism intended as a manual for teachers. He has, at times, been identified by some scholars with the 2nd century Middle Platonist Albinus.\n\nAlcinous is the author of work called \"The Handbook of Platonism\" (, also ; ), one of the few surviving works from the Middle Platonist period (c. 90 BC – 250 AD). The book contains 36 chapters which cover topics ranging from logic to physics to ethics. It is thought to have been intended as a manual, not for students of Platonism, but for its teachers. The treatise is written in the esoteric manner typical of the Corpus Aristotelicum, and it often appropriates popular concepts from other philosophical schools — in particular the Peripatetic and Stoic schools — which could be seen as having been prefigured in the works of Plato.\n\nAlcinous's handbook has been dated to the middle of the 2nd century AD. In 1879 the German scholar Jacob Freudenthal argued that Alcinous was really the philosopher Albinus, the teacher of Galen the physician. This theory remained largely unchallenged until 1974, when John Whittaker made a fresh case convincingly reaffirming Alcinous's authenticity.\n\nAlcinous held the world and its animating soul to be eternal. This soul of the universe was not created by God, but, to use the image of Alcinous, it was awakened by him as from a profound sleep, and turned towards himself, \"that it might look out upon intellectual things and receive forms and ideas from the divine mind.\" It was the first of a succession of intermediate beings between God and man. The \"idea\" proceeded immediately from the mind of God, and were the highest object of our intellect; the \"form\" of matter, the types of sensible things, having a real being in themselves. He differed from the earlier Platonists in confining the \"ideas\" to general laws: it seemed an unworthy notion that God could conceive an \"idea\" of things artificial or unnatural, or of individuals or particulars, or of any thing relative. He seems to have aimed at harmonizing the views of Plato and Aristotle on the \"ideas\", as he distinguished them from the \"eidos\", forms of things, which he allowed were inseparable: a view which seems necessarily connected with the doctrine of the eternity and self-existence of matter. God, the first fountain of the \"ideas\", could not be known as he is: it is but a faint notion of him we obtain from negations and analogies: his nature is equally beyond our power of expression or conception. Below him are a series of beings (\"daimones\") who superintend the production of all living things, and hold intercourse with men. The human soul passes through various transmigrations, thus connecting the series with the lower classes of being, until it is finally purified and rendered acceptable to God. His system is understood as a synthesis of Plato and Aristotle, with some elements borrowed from the East, and perhaps derived from a study of the Pythagorean system, which experienced a revival of sorts concomitant to that which produced Middle Platonism.\n\n\n"}

He moved into management and has been in charge of Walsall, Kettering Town, West Bromwich Albion, Lincoln City and Rochdale. He gained renown for his three stints as manager of Grimsby Town between 1988 and 2008, where his accolades have made him the club's most successful manager. Buckley is one of only 14 managers to have reached 1,000 matches in charge of a league club, but the only one of the 14 never to have managed a team in the Premiership or its predecessor, the First Division.\n\nBuckley began his career with Nottingham Forest, but was transferred to Walsall in 1973 having never managed to win a regular place in the first team. He became a prolific striker at Fellows Park, before he was transferred briefly to Birmingham City in October 1978. He returned to Walsall as their record signing (£175,000) in June 1979. He began his managerial career with 'The Saddlers', initially as player/manager and briefly as co-manager with Neil Martin. This was an era that became a hallmark for some of the most attractive football seen in Walsall and the side gradually established itself as promotion contenders.\n\nBuckley gained a favourable reputation during his time in the Black Country, scoring against Manchester United as a player during an FA Cup upset in January 1975, and leading his Walsall side as a manager to victories against the likes of Arsenal, and a draw at Anfield during a League Cup run which took them to the semi-finals, just '90 Minutes From Europe'. He was sacked in August 1986, when Terry Ramsden bought the club, installing his own managerial team within 90 minutes of the takeover deal being completed.\n\nAlan Buckley is still regarded very highly at Walsall; promotion in his first season as manager and in 1984 taking the European Champions Liverpool all the way in a Milk Cup semi final after drawing at Anfield 2-2. Walsall were the better team but poor finishing and bad luck at home meant Liverpool won 2–0 with their only shots after which Graeme Souness said he would rather play against Juventus than Walsall as they totally \"outplayed us\" at times after the match.\n\nHe joined Tamworth as a player in October 1986, playing a total of five games for the club, three in the West Midlands Premier League, with a debut in the 2–0 victory at Tividale on 4 October 1986.\n\nLater as a manager, after a spell with non-league Kettering Town, he guided Grimsby Town to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1990 and they reached the Second Division a year later – where they spent all but one of the next 12 seasons. In his first two spells at the club, Buckley's Grimsby sides were renowned for their attractive passing game and mounted periodic challenges for the play-offs. Buckley remained at Blundell Park until the autumn of 1994 when he joined Grimsby's Division One rivals West Bromwich Albion. His spell at the Hawthorns lasted two-and-a-half years before he was sacked for failing to get Albion anywhere near a promotion challenge.\n\nA few months after being sacked by Albion, Buckley returned to Grimsby in summer 1997 for his second spell as manager. Town had just been relegated to Division Two, but he took them back to Division One at the first time of asking with two Wembley visits in 1998. Buckley remained in charge for two full seasons after that, but was dismissed after just two games of 2000–01. A couple of brief, short-lived spells in Division Three followed – first with Lincoln City, arriving at Sincil Bank in January 2001. Buckley left the Imps in April 2002, with the club stating that financial reasons were behind his departure. He then took charge of Rochdale in June 2003, but left by mutual consent in December of the same year after failing to revive the club's fortunes. On 9 November 2006 Buckley was appointed manager of Grimsby for a third time.\n\nIn his first season back with Grimsby, a mid-table finish was considered a creditable achievement after relegation from the Football League had looked a distinct possibility. In 2007–08, Grimsby made a slow start but soon picked up. A good run in the Football League Trophy saw The Mariners travel to the new Wembley 10 years after their first visit. However this time Grimsby lost 0–2 to MK Dons. League form suffered terribly afterwards, the season ending with eight straight defeats. After gaining just two points from the opening six games of the 2008–09 season, Buckley was again dismissed as manager.\n\nIn his three stints as Grimsby Town manager—spanning, in total, over 10 years—the club was never relegated and he also guided them to three promotions.\nOnly 14 managers have reached 1,000 matches in charge of a Football League team by 1998 and Buckley is one of them.\n\nOn 14 June 2012 Buckley returned to Grimsby for a fourth time by joining the coaching staff as the new U17's team manager.\n\nHis younger brother Steve played over 300 games as a full-back for Derby County, and well over 100 for Luton Town.

The facility opened in 2005 and houses the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Provincial Museum of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThe facility was constructed on a hill overlooking the port city, at a historic location once occupied by Fort Townshend. The building can be seen from almost any point in St. John's, and the facility has, since its construction, competed with its neighbour, the Basilica of St. John the Baptist, for the dominance of the St. John's skyline.\n\nThe building's name, as well as its architecture, is a reference to the simple gable-roofed sheds (called \"fishing rooms\") that were once so common at the waterline in Newfoundland fishing villages.\n\nDuring the planning and construction of the building much opposition was raised by archaeologists and historians because of its location. Previously on the same strategic spot of land was located Fort Townshend, an 18th-century military fort, that was eventually buried under ground. The great star-shaped citadel, one of the largest British fortifications in North America at the time, was built to defend Britain's fishing interests. With the withdrawal of the imperial garrison in 1870, the site became the home of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary and, later, the St. John's Fire Department.\n\nThe site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1951.\n\nOn-site interpretation allows visitors to explore this historic past. Careful research and documentation before construction ensured that future study of the site is possible.\n\nIn March 2013, The Rooms Corporation announced it would be developing an outdoor space to improve access and safety, and to commemorate the history of Fort Townshend. The outline of the Fort was marked with granite pavers along a lit pathway, as an extension of the Grand Concourse. Plans to excavate archaeological remains of Fort Townshend, which are largely located under the building, were not defined in the scope of the project. The outdoor space was completed by the Grand Concourse Authority in two phases between 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe facility was officially opened on June 29, 2005. The building offers a panoramic view of downtown St. John's and its architecture, St. John's Harbour, The Narrows and Signal Hill. The Rooms operates as the provincial archives, art gallery, and museum. The archives, art gallery, and museum serve as separate departments of The Rooms.\n\nLocated on the third floor of The Rooms, the mandate of Archives Division is to preserve records of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador which have enduring value, whether legal, fiscal, evidential or for research purposes. The Archives also collects documents and other records from private sources if they are deemed to have value to the history of the province.\n\nThe Archives database can be accessed here.\n\nThe Rooms Provincial Art Gallery is the premiere public gallery in the province dedicated to developing and exhibiting contemporary art, with 10,000 square feet of space for permanent collections and travelling exhibits. Since opening in 2005, the gallery has produced an average of 15 exhibitions annually; ranging from new-media installations to Renaissance printmaking. The gallery presents new work from across Canada and the world, with a special (though not exclusive) focus on artists working in Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThe gallery manages several collections, known together as the \"Permanent Collections\": Memorial University of Newfoundland; the J. K. Pratt Memorial Collection; The Rooms Collection; and the Art Procurement Collection of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (Provincial Art Bank). Altogether, they comprise over 7,000 works of art, primarily post-1960 Canadian art. Emphasis is placed on art of Newfoundland and Labrador, with major holdings of such artists as Christopher Pratt, Mary Pratt, Gerald Squires, David Blackwood, Reginald Shepherd, Helen Parsons Shepherd, Don Wright and Anne Meredith Barry.\n\nThe Provincial Museum focuses on the natural and cultural history of Newfoundland and Labrador. Exhibits include dioramas of the animal and plant life of the tundra and bog, mounted bird displays, and the aboriginal people who lived in the area. Other displays include the city's British military history, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, and the culture and contributions of the area's Irish fishermen. Changing exhibits focus on other aspects of the province's history, natural history and culture.\n\nThe original Newfoundland Museum was located in a large Classical Revival brick and sandstone building at 285 Duckworth Street in Downtown St. John's.\nThe address of The Rooms is 9 Bonaventure Avenue in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThe Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n"}

One also says that \"X\" is finite over \"Y\".\n\nIn fact, \"f\" is finite if and only if for \"every\" open affine open subscheme \"V\" = Spec \"B\" in \"Y\", the inverse image of \"V\" in \"X\" is affine, of the form Spec \"A\", with \"A\" a finitely generated \"B\"-module.\n\nFor example, for any field \"k\", formula_4is a finite morphism since formula_5 as formula_6-modules. Geometrically, this is obviously finite since this a ramified n-sheeted cover of the affine line which degenerates at the origin. By contrast, the inclusion of \"A\" − 0 into \"A\" is not finite. (Indeed, the Laurent polynomial ring \"k\"[\"y\", \"y\"] is not finitely generated as a module over \"k\"[\"y\"].) This restricts our geometric intuition to surjective families with finite fibers.\n\n\nFor a homomorphism \"A\" → \"B\" of commutative rings, \"B\" is called an \"A\"-algebra of finite type if \"B\" is a finitely generated as an \"A\"-algebra. It is much stronger for \"B\" to be a finite \"A\"-algebra, which means that \"B\" is finitely generated as an \"A\"-module. For example, for any commutative ring \"A\" and natural number \"n\", the polynomial ring \"A\"[\"x\", ..., \"x\"] is an \"A\"-algebra of finite type, but it is not a finite \"A\"-algebra unless \"A\" = 0 or \"n\" = 0. Another example of a finite-type morphism which is not finite is formula_7.\n\nThe analogous notion in terms of schemes is: a morphism \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" of schemes is of finite type if \"Y\" has a covering by affine open subschemes \"V\" = Spec \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"V\") has a finite covering by affine open subschemes \"U\" = Spec \"B\" with \"B\" an \"A\"-algebra of finite type. One also says that \"X\" is of finite type over \"Y\".\n\nFor example, for any natural number \"n\" and field \"k\", affine \"n\"-space and projective \"n\"-space over \"k\" are of finite type over \"k\" (that is, over Spec \"k\"), while they are not finite over \"k\" unless \"n\" = 0. More generally, any quasi-projective scheme over \"k\" is of finite type over \"k\".\n\nThe Noether normalization lemma says, in geometric terms, that every affine scheme \"X\" of finite type over a field \"k\" has a finite surjective morphism to affine space A over \"k\", where \"n\" is the dimension of \"X\". Likewise, every projective scheme \"X\" over a field has a finite surjective morphism to projective space P, where \"n\" is the dimension of \"X\".\n\n\n"}

His frequent absences from his family helped her goal of keeping her children away from his bad influence succeed. Eventually, however, she herself entered into a relationship with the actor Otto Tressler, who had been presented to her by the emperor Franz Joseph, who felt sorry for her because of the adultery of her spouse. Maria Josepha often invited Tressler to her home; he sometimes met her husband and his friends in the doorway. When her husband died, her ability to avoid extravagant displays of grief was much admired. As a widow, she ended her relationship with Tressler, probably because of her sense of what was appropriate behaviour for a widow.\nDuring World War I she nursed the wounded in the Augarten Palace of Vienna, which had been converted into a hospital.\nIn 1919 she left Austria with her son Emperor Charles I of Austria and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, and went into exile with them.

In this Executive Order, the War Manpower Commission was headed by the Federal Security Administrator as Chairman, and consisted of representatives from the Department of War, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the War Production Board, the Labor Production Division of the War Production Board, the Selective Service System, and the United States Civil Service Commission to ensure effective mobilization of manpower in the post-war era.\n\nExecutive Order 9279, dated December 5, 1942, transferred the Selective Service System to the War Manpower Commission. However, a year later it was made a separate agency directly responsible to the President.\n\nMcNutt appointed all men to his labor advisory committee, despite the pleas of Women’s Bureau director, Mary Anderson, to have women represented. Instead, he created a Women’s Advisory Committee appointing thirteen prominent women professionals, business executives, journalists, educators and organizational presidents.

(The others being the Go Bowling at The Glen at Watkins Glen International and the Bank of America Roval 400 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.)\n\nThe race joined the NASCAR circuit in 1989. It was added as a replacement for the Budweiser 400 at Riverside, which closed in 1988. The race has undergone several name and length changes since its inception. The NASCAR \"West Series\" held a combination race from 1989 to 1997 and has held a standalone race since 2006. Due to the track's unique layout, the race generates annual discussion, with media, fans, and participants both in favor and against racing this event. Due to its unique layout, \"road course ringers\" are common, a NASCAR term standing for drivers that appear on the NASCAR circuit only for the road course races.\n\nMartin Truex Jr. is the defending winner of the event for the past years in 2018 and 2019.\n\nFrom 1989–1997 and since 2019, NASCAR uses the full road course, best known for sports car racing. Subtle changes to some of the turns accommodated the stock cars, and increased passing widths. Ricky Rudd won the inaugural Cup race at Sonoma.\n\nThe 1991 Sonoma Cup race ended in controversial fashion. With seven laps left in the race, Mark Martin tried to pass Tommy Kendall, subbing for an injured Kyle Petty. The two made contact, resulting in Martin crashing into the tire barrier on a pull-over site and Kendall cutting his tire. The lead went to Davey Allison. Then, with two laps left, pole-sitter Rudd passed Allison for the lead but Allison spun out from contact in the final turn. Rudd led to the white flag and was contending to win the race, his second Sonoma victory, and to advance his championship points to the lead. However, as he came around to take the win, Rudd was black-flagged just three feet from the finish line. Allison was declared the winner of the race with Rudd's controversial penalty while Rudd finished in second place.\n\nThe last Sonoma NASCAR race held at the previous road course passage was in 1997 on October 5 at a Truck series event. There, Joe Ruttman won the race but controversy erupted when Rich Bickle blamed a loss of a top-ten finish on rookie Boris Said. Bickle cut down Said's tire and in reply Said waited for Bickle to come back around and crashed him. NASCAR, after a brief red flag for a massive crash in a wall of tires, disqualified Said and fined him $10,000 for his actions.\n\nIn 1998, the circuit for the NASCAR event was shorted from the full road course to a modified road course with the addition of the \"Chute\" from turn 4 to turn 7, bypassing turns 5 and 6.\n\nIn 2001 the \"Chute\" was modified to such that the NASCAR circuit measured long.\n\nIn 2019, the race returned to the full road course layout to commemorate its 50th anniversary. This will mark the return of the \"Carousel\" section after a 20-year hiatus.\n\nOn May 8th, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, it was announced that the race would not take place in 2020.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2001, the pit road could only accommodate 34 pit stalls. In the early years, some teams were required to share pit stalls while other teams were forced to pit inside the garage area. When cars dropped out of the race, their pit stalls were reassigned to cars who were sharing.\n\nAfter a few years, a makeshift auxiliary pit road was constructed inside the hairpin (turn 11) nicknamed \"Gilligan's Island\". Cars that had the nine slowest qualifying speeds were relegated to these pit stalls. Pitting in this area was considered an inconvenience and a competitive disadvantage, more so than even the disadvantages one would experience pitting on the backstretch at a short track at the time.\n\nSince the length of the auxiliary pit road was significantly shorter than the main pit road, the cars that pitted there were held from 15–20 seconds to make up for the time that would have been spent if the cars had traveled the entire main pit road.\n\nPitting on \"Gilligan's Island\" had several other inconveniences. The location (the staging area for drag races) was landlocked by the race course, and crew members were unable to leave once the race began. Teams sent only the primary pit crew to \"Gilligan's Island\", and once they were there, they could not access the garage area or their transporters to collect spare parts/tools. The only repairs that could be made were routine tire changes and refueling, as well as only minor repairs. Other auxiliary pit crew members, who were not part of the main crew, were staged in the garage area, and would have to service the car if it required major repairs. If a team pitting on \"Gilligan's Island\" dropped out of the race, the crew was unable to pack up their supplies and prepare to leave (a common practice at other tracks) until the race was over.\n\nChanges to the track in 2002 that included separation of the drag strip from the frontstretch, removal of the main drag strip grandstand, and the new control tower for road racing led to the pit road being expanded by extending pit road into the main straight and moving the pit exit up the hill past Turn 1, thereby expanding it to 43 cars, and Gilligan's Island was abandoned.\n\nThe trophy is in the form of wine bottle holder paired with a giant wine glass as a nod to Napa County's wine industry.\n\n\n\n\nTelevised rights were first handled by ESPN from the race outset in 1989 through 2000. The 1998 race started on ESPN2 because a golf tournament, which aired before the race, was in a playoff. Fox held broadcast rights between 2001–2006. TNT broadcast the race from 2007–2014. In 2015, the race will return to Fox Sports. With the final schedule being revealed on August 26, it was announced that the race will be shown on Fox Sports 1. Maxim magazine ranked this race as one of their top ten annual NASCAR Cup Series races.\n\n"}

Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, it is the opening track on the third side of the LP (or the second disc in CD versions of the record). Surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr performed it for Starr's 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall on 7 July 2010.\n\nThe song was largely written during a recording session at EMI Studios on 18 September 1968 by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. McCartney: \"We thought, 'Why not make something up?' So we got a riff going and arranged it around this riff. So that is 50–50 John and me, made up on the spot and recorded all in the same evening.\" During the session, the Beatles and the recording crew made a short trip around the corner to McCartney's house to watch the 1956 rock & roll movie \"The Girl Can't Help It\" which was being shown for the first time on British television. After the movie they returned to record \"Birthday\".\n\nGeorge Martin was away so his assistant Chris Thomas produced the session. His memory is that the song was mostly McCartney's: \"Paul was the first one in, and he was playing the 'Birthday' riff. Eventually the others arrived, by which time Paul had literally written the song, right there in the studio.\" Everyone in the studio sang in the chorus and it was 5 am by the time the final mono mix was completed.\n\nLennon said in his \"Playboy\" interview in 1980: \"'Birthday' was written in the studio. Just made up on the spot. I think Paul wanted to write a song like 'Happy Birthday Baby', the old fifties hit. But it was sort of made up in the studio. It was a piece of garbage.\"\n\n\"Birthday\" begins with an intro drum fill, then moves directly into a blues progression in A (in the form of a guitar riff doubled by the bass) with McCartney singing at the top of his chest voice with Lennon on a lower harmony. After this section, a drum break lasting eight measures brings the song into the middle section, which rests entirely on the dominant. A repeat of the blues progression/guitar riff instrumental section, augmented by piano brings the song into a bridge before returning to a repeat of the first vocal section, this time with the piano accompaniment.\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Birthday\" at number 17 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote of the song: \"The opening to the second-half [of the album] treads familiar Beatles ground with an improvised riff that could be the record's biggest earworm. Hilariously, Lennon would go on to call [the song] 'garbage'.\"\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAdditional participants\n\nHowever, according to the book accompanying the 2018 box set \"The Beatles: Super Deluxe Version\", the annotation on the tape box from the session offers an alternative line-up that \"explodes some myths of who played what\":\n\nPaul McCartney released a live version on 8 October 1990 in the UK, with a US release albeit only as a cassette on 16 October. Originally appearing on \"Tripping the Live Fantastic\", the single reached number 29 on the UK Singles Chart and number 3 in Italy. The B-side was a live version of \"Good Day Sunshine\". McCartney also released a 12\" single and CD single with those songs and two more live tracks, \"P.S. Love Me Do\" and \"Let 'Em In\". \"P.S. Love Me Do\" is a combination of \"P.S. I Love You\" and \"Love Me Do\".\n\nUnderground Sunshine recorded the song as a single in 1969. Their version was a minor hit in the US, reaching number 19 on the \"Cash Box\" chart and number 26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nPaul Weller covered the song for McCartney's 70th birthday. This version was available for download on 18 June 2012 for one day only. Even with this limited mode of distribution, the track reached number 64 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n"}

Prior to the 2007 census, Jimma was reorganized administratively as a special Zone.\n\nHerbert S. Lewis states that in the early 1960s it was \"the greatest market in all of south-western Ethiopia. On a good day in the dry season it attracts up to thirty thousand people. Following the death of Abba Jifar II of Jimma, Emperor Haile Selassie seized the opportunity to annex Jimma. In 1932, the Kingdom of Jimma was formally absorbed into Ethiopia. During the reorganization of the provinces in 1942, Jimma vanished into Kaffa Province.\"\n\nWhat is now Jimma's northern suburb of Jiren was the capital of a large Kaffa province until the overthrowal of the feudal system. Originally named \"Hirmata\", the city owed its importance in the 19th century to being located on the caravan route between Shewa and the Kingdom of Kaffa, as well as being only six miles from the palace of the king of Jimma.\n\nAccording to Donald Levine, in the early 19th century the market attracted thousands of people from neighboring regions: \"Amhara from Gojjam and Shoa, Oromo from all the Gibe Kingdoms and numerous representatives of the Lacustrine and Omotic groups, including Timbaro, Qabena, Kefa, Janjero, Welamo, Konta and several others\".\n\nThe present town was developed on the Awetu River by the Italian colonial regime in the 1930s. At that time, with the goal of weakening the native Ethiopian Church, the Italians intended to make Jimma an important center of Islamic learning, and founded an academy to teach \"fiqh\". In the East African fighting of World War II after their main force was defeated, the Italian garrison at Jimma was one of the last to surrender, holding out til July 1941.\n\nJimma was the scene of a violent encounter which started in April 1975 between radical college students (known as \"zemacha\") sent to organize local peasants, who had benefited from land reform, and local police, who had sided with local landowners. Students and peasant followers had imprisoned local small landowners, rich peasants and members of the local police force; this action led to further unrest, causing the Derg (the ruling junta) to send a special delegation to Jimma, which sided with the local police. In the end, 24 students were killed, more arrested, and the local \"zemacha\" camps closed.\n\nDays before the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in May 1991, the city was captured by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.\n\nOn 13 December 2006, the Ethiopian government announced that it had secured a loan of US$98 million from the African Development Bank to pave the 227 kilometers of highway between Jimma and Mizan Teferi to the southwest. The loan would cover 64% of the 1270.97 million Birr budgeted for this project.\n\nJimma has a relatively cool tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am) under the Köppen climate classification. It features a long annual wet season from March to October.\n\nTemperatures at Jimma are in a comfortable range, with the daily mean staying between 20 °C and 25 °C year-round.\n\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this Zone has a total population of 120,960, of whom 60,824 are men and 60,136 women. With an area of 50.52 square kilometers, Jimma has a population density of 2,394.30 all are urban inhabitants. A total of 32,191 households were counted in this Zone, which results in an average of 3.76 persons to a household, and 30,016 housing units. The three largest ethnic groups reported in Jimma were the Oromo (36.71%), the Amhara (27.14%) and the Dawro (10.05%); all other ethnic groups made up 26.1% of the population. Amharic was spoken as a first language by 41.58% and 39.96% spoke Afan Oromo; the remaining 18.46% spoke all other primary languages reported. The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 46.84% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 39.03% of the population were Muslim, and 13.06% were Protestant.\n\nThe national 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 88,867, of whom 43,874 were men and 44,993 were women.\n\nA few buildings have survived from the time of the Jimma Kingdom, including the Palace of Abba Jifar. The city is home to a museum, Jimma University, several markets, and an airport (ICAO code HAJM, IATA JIM). Also of note is the Jimma Research Center, founded in 1968, which is run by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research. The Center specializes in agricultural research, including serving as the national center for research to improve the yield of coffee and spices.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Jimma. The 50,000-capacity Jimma University Stadium is the largest venue by capacity in Jimma. It is used mostly for football matches.\n\nJimma is served by Jimma Aba Jifar Airport. The airport completed a renovation in 2015 in order to accommodate larger aircraft and more passengers.\n\nWithin the city limits people take bajajs (similar to “tuktuks”) or “line taxis” that are converted mini vans. \n\n"}

The standard English name in its native area is creeping thistle. It is also commonly known as Canada thistle and field thistle.\n\nThe plant is beneficial for pollinators that rely on nectar. It also was a top producer of nectar sugar in a 2016 study in Britain, with a second-place ranking due to a production per floral unit of (2609 +/- 239 μg).\n\nA number of other names are used in other areas or have been used in the past, including: Canadian thistle, lettuce from hell thistle, California thistle, corn thistle, cursed thistle, field thistle, green thistle, hard thistle, perennial thistle, prickly thistle, small-flowered thistle, way thistle and stinger-needles. Canada and Canadian thistle are in wide use in the United States, despite being a misleading designation (it is not of Canadian origin).\n\n\"Cirsium arvense\" is a C3 carbon fixation plant. The C3 plants originated during Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras, and tend to thrive in areas where sunlight intensity is moderate, temperatures are moderate, and ground water is plentiful. plants lose 97% of the water taken up through their roots to transpiration.\n\nCreeping thistle is a herbaceous perennial plant growing up to 150 cm, forming extensive clonal colonies from thickened roots that send up numerous erect shoots during the growing season. It is a ruderal species.\n\nGIven its adaptive nature, \"Cirsium arvense\" is one of the worst invasive weeds worldwide. Through comparison of its genetic expressions, the plant evolves differently with respects to where it has established itself. Differences can be seen in their R-protein mediated defenses, sensitivities to abiotic stresses and developmental timing.\n\nThe canada thistle is part of the \"Cirsium\" genus, in the subtribe Carduinae, trube Cardueae and family Astreracae. It differs from other species in the same genus given its dioecious flowers. It it also different from other native North American species given its large roots and multiple small flower heads on a branched stem\n\nIts underground structure consists of four types, 1) long, thick, horizontal roots, 2) long, thick, vertical roots, 3) short, fine shoots, and 4) vertical, underground stems. Though asserted in some literature, creeping thistle does not form rhizomes. Root buds form adventitiously on the thickened roots of creeping thistle, and give rise to new shoots. Shoots can also arise from the lateral buds on the underground portion of regular shoots, particularly if the shoots are cut off through mowing or when stem segments are buried.\n\nStems are 30–150 cm, slender green, and freely branched, smooth and glabrous (having no trichomes or glaucousness), mostly without spiny wings. Leaves are alternate on the stem with their base sessile and clasping or shortly decurrent. The leaves are very spiny, lobed, and up to 15–20 cm long and 2–3 cm broad (smaller on the upper part of the flower stem).\n\nEvery plant species has a unique floral fragrance composition. the fragrance that C. arvense emits attracts both pollinators and florivores containing compounds that attract each respectively. Nonnative honeybees are shown to have the highest visitation rate, following other bee species such as halictus and lasioglossum. Hover flies are also commonly seen pollinating the flower heads of this plant. Florivores such as Beetles and Grasshoppers are commonly seen as well. The compounds found in the fragrance may not be in the highest abundance but they are highly attractive. P-anisaldehyde is found in less than 1%, yet it attracts pollinators such as honey bees. This is thought to be the result of additive and synergistic effects from the blend increasing the attraction to the plant. After pollination, it can be seen that fragrance emission decreases in C.arvense. This is regulated through a regulatory feedback mechanism depending on the pollination status of the plant. This mechanism has only been observed in pistillate plants for dioecious C. arvense. Fragrance emission increases with age.\n\nThe fragrance contains several compounds that attract diverse insects. Looking at certain butterflies species, it can be seen that the fragrance blend is highly attractive to them, being sensitive to their antennae. High antennal response are seen in consequence to the phenylacetaldehyde as well as the terpenes (oxoisophoroneoxide, oxoisophorone, and dihydrooxoisophorone) found in the blend. This was seen in both natural plants emitting the fragrance and emitting the scent synthetically. It is believed that general arousal can be stimulated through exposure of a single compound, whereas the accumulated exposure of all the compounds influence the foraging behaviour of the butterflies.\n\nThe inflorescence compound cyme is in diameter, pink-purple, with all the florets of similar form (no division into disc and ray florets). The flowers are usually dioecious, but not invariably so, with some plants bearing hermaphrodite flowers. The seeds are 4–5 mm long, with a feathery pappus which assists in wind dispersal. One to 5 flower heads occur per branch, with plants in very favourable conditions producing up to 100 heads per shoot. Each head contains an average of 100 florets. Average seed production per plant has been estimated at 1530. More seeds are produced when male and female plants are closer together, as flowers are primarily insect-pollinated. The plant can bloom from seed in a year then subsequently the seeds produced can emerge in the following year.\n\nVariation in leaf characters (texture, vestiture, segmentation, spininess) is the basis for determining creeping thistle varieties. According to Flora of Northwest Europe the two varieties are:\nThe Biology of Canadian Weeds: \"Cirsium arvense\" list four varieties:\n\nThe seeds are an important food for the goldfinch and the linnet, and to a lesser extent for other finches. Creeping thistle foliage is used as a food by over 20 species of Lepidoptera, including the painted lady butterfly and the engrailed moth, and several species of aphids.\n\nThe flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects such as bees, moths, wasps and beetles (the generalised pollination syndrome).\n\nThe species is widely considered a weed even where it is native, for example being designated an \"injurious weed\" in the United Kingdom under the Weeds Act 1959. It is also a serious invasive species in many additional regions where it has been introduced, usually accidentally as a contaminant in cereal crop seeds. It is cited as a noxious weed in several countries; for example Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States. Many countries regulate this plant, or its parts (i.e., seed) as a contaminant of other imported products such as grains for consumption or seeds for propagation. In Canada, \"C. arvense\" is classified as a primary noxious weed seed in the Weed Seeds Order 2005 which applies to Canada's Seeds Regulations.\n\nControl methods include cutting at flower stem extension before the flower buds open to prevent seed spread. Repeated cutting at the same growth stage over several years may \"wear down\" the plant.\n\nGrowing forages such as alfalfa can help control the species as a weed by frequently cutting the alfalfa to add nutrients to the soil, the weeds also get cut, and have a harder time re-establishing themselves, which reduces the shoot density.\n\n\"Orellia ruficauda\" feeds on Canada thistle and has been reported to be the most effective biological control agent for that plant. Its larvae parasitize the seed heads, feeding solely upon fertile seed heads.\n\nThe weevil \"Larinus planus\" also feeds on the thistle and has been used as a control agent in Canada. One larva of the species can consume up to 95% of seeds in a particular flower bud. However, use of this weevil has had a damaging effect on other thistle species as well, include some that are threatened. It may therefore not be a desirable control agent. It is unclear if the government continues to use this weevil to control Canada thistles or not.\n\nThe rust species \"Puccinia obtegens\" has shown some promise for controlling Canada thistle, but it must be used in conjunction with other control measures to be effective. Also \"Puccinia punctiformis\" is used in North America and New Zealand in biological control. In 2013, in four countries in three continents, epidemics of systemic disease caused by this rust fungus could be routinely and easily established. The procedure for establishing this control agent involves three simple steps and is a long-term sustainable control solution that is free and does not involve herbicides. Plants systemically diseased with the rust gradually but surely die. Reductions in thistle density were estimated, in 10 sites in the U.S., Greece, and Russia, to average 43%, 64%, and 81% by 18, 30, and 42 months, respectively, after a single application of spores of the fungus.\n\"Aceria anthocoptes\" feeds on this species and is considered to be a good potential biological control agent.\n\nApplying herbicide: Herbicides dominated by phenoxy compounds (especially MCPA) caused drastic declines in thistle infestation in Sweden in the 1950s. MCPA and clopyralid are approved in some regions. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that can be used when the plant has grown a few inches tall, where the herbicide can be absorbed by the leaf surfaces. \n\nCrop tolerance and weed control ratings were conducted in the spring of 2012, and the Prepass herbicide by DOW AgroSciences was found to be most effective at controlling the species as a weed problem in alfalfa fields.\n\nLike other \"Cirsium\" species, the roots are edible, though rarely used, not in the least because of their propensity to induce flatulence in some people. The taproot is considered the most nutritious part. The leaves are also edible, though the spines make their preparation for food too tedious to be worthwhile. The stalks, however, are also edible and more easily despined.\nBruichladdich distillery on Isle of Islay lists creeping thistle as one of the 22 botanical forages used in their gin, The Botanist.\n\nThe feathery pappus is also used by the Cherokee to fletch blowgun darts.\n\n"}

They are commonly called earth-boring dung beetles. Most excavate burrows in which to lay their eggs. They are typically detritivores, provisioning their nests with leaf litter (often moldy), but are occasionally coprophagous, similar to dung beetles. The eggs are laid in or upon the provision mass and buried, and the developing larvae feed upon the provisions. The burrows of some species can exceed 2 metres in depth.\n\nA few species communicate by stridulation (rubbing body parts together to make sounds).\n\nThey were originally classified as the subfamily Geotrupinae in the family Scarabaeidae before being elevated to a family. Traditionally the dor beetle family Bolboceratidae was included (as the subfamily Bolboceratinae) on the basis of the number of antenna segments, but examination of a different set of characteristics prompted Scholtz & Browne (1995) to elevate Bolboceratidae to a family, a result supported by recent phylogenetic research.\n\nThe family has more than 600 species in about 30 genera in two subfamilies; recent phylogenetic studies indicate that Taurocerastinae is not related to Geotrupinae, and is instead more closely related to Lucanidae and Diphyllostomatidae.\n\n\n"}

He is the son of Henry Gould and Helen McKellar Gould (née Morton). He spent his youth living in Wyken and attended Caludon Castle School for his secondary education.\n\nGould started his football career at Coventry City, making his debut for the club whilst still an apprentice at the age of 16. He did not sign professional until June 1964. A striker, he scored 40 goals in 82 league games for the Sky Blues, helping them to win the Second Division title in 1966–67.\n\nHe moved to Arsenal in February 1968 for £90,000. He could not hold down a regular place in the Arsenal first team, although he did score a headed goal in the 1969 League Cup Final against Swindon Town, to send the game into extra time; Arsenal went on to lose 3–1. Gould played no part in Arsenal's European Fairs Cup 1969–70 final win and by the end of 1969–70 was on the sidelines at Arsenal. He made two appearances and scored a goal earlier in the cup run against Glentoran.\n\nIn June 1970 Gould was transferred to Wolves for a fee of £55,000, and made his debut against Newcastle United in August 1970, but after just 15 months he was signed by West Bromwich Albion manager Don Howe for £66,666. He made his Albion debut at home to Ipswich Town in the same month, and partnering Jeff Astle in attack, went on to score 12 goals in his first season at the Hawthorns. In all he scored 19 goals in 60 appearances for Albion, but when his form began to wane he was sold to Bristol City for £68,888 in December 1972.\n\nGould joined West Ham United in November 1973 for an £80,000 fee, and picked up a winners' medal in the 1975 FA Cup Final as a non-playing substitute. He re-joined Wolves for £30,000 in December 1975 and helped them to win the Second Division title in 1976-77. He moved on to Bristol Rovers for £10,000 in October 1977, assuming the role of player-coach. Between January and April 1978 Gould coached the Norwegian side Aalesunds FK, and joined Hereford United as player-coach for £10,000 in September of the same year.\n\nGould joined Chelsea as assistant manager to Geoff Hurst in 1979. When Hurst was sacked in April 1981, Gould took charge of first team affairs for the final two games of the season, before leaving the club shortly afterwards.\n\nGould began his managerial career with Bristol Rovers in October 1981 before returning to Coventry City as boss in May 1983. He remained there until he was sacked on 28 December 1984. The highlight of this spell at Coventry came on 10 December 1983 when his unfancied Coventry side achieved a 4–0 win over Liverpool, the top English club side of the time who went on to win the league title, League Cup and European Cup that season.\n\nHe made a swift return to management after accepting an offer to return to Bristol Rovers.\n\nGould is most famous for his achievements with Wimbledon. He moved to the South Londoners in the summer of 1987 after their first season as a First Division club, in which they had finished sixth. His first season brought one of the most famous FA Cup victories in history, when his unfancied Wimbledon side beat Liverpool to clinch the 1988 FA Cup Final at Wembley. They also finished seventh in the league. Gould is famous for adopting the technique of, as he says, \"goal keepers who can kick the ball 90 yards and a 6-foot 2 bloke to head it in!\" he said jokingly on talkSPORT with Andy Goldstein.\n\nGould remained with the Dons for two more seasons before quitting to make way for his assistant Ray Harford.\n\nIn December 1990, Gould returned to football as assistant manager to Don Howe at Queen's Park Rangers – a role reversal of the management team that they had formed at Wimbledon. Gould lasted just two months at Loftus Road before accepting an offer to become manager of West Bromwich Albion. \n\nBut he was unable to prevent them from suffering relegation to the old Third Division at the end of the 1990–91 season – the first time that Albion had slipped to such depths.\n\nIn 1991–92, Albion just missed out on the playoffs in their first season as a Third Division club and Gould left in June 1992 to join Coventry, his former club. Ironically, Howe was working at Coventry by this time and the pair were joint managers, but Howe stepped down before the season began to leave Gould in sole charge.\n\nHe remained at Coventry City until October 1993, when he resigned despite defying all the odds and keeping them clear of relegation from the Premiership. In his first season, they had been fourth in the league as late as January before a late season dip in form saw them finish 15th. Earlier in the season he had paid Newcastle United £250,000 for striker Mick Quinn, who was among the top scorers in the first-ever Premier League season with 17 goals. He also oversaw a thrilling 5–1 victory in the league over Liverpool, and the following season they began with a similarly impressive 3–0 win over Arsenal at Highbury.\n\nHis next stop was with the Welsh national team. He became national coach in June 1995 but quit four years later after their failure to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Gould was not at all highly regarded by the Welsh fans, following questionable tactics and major fallings out with players such as Nathan Blake, when Blake refused to play after accusing Gould of making a racist remark in training, as well as Mark Hughes. Gould also engaged in a wrestling bout with John Hartson. A comical incident occurred early in the career of Robbie Savage when Savage jokingly threw a replica of Paolo Maldini's shirt away on Sky Sports before a match against Italy. Gould initially dropped Savage from the squad for disrespecting Maldini, only to reinstate him the next day. Gould's final match was a 4–0 defeat to Italy in which he allegedly instructed Mark Hughes \"not to tackle the Italians as they'll only dive\".\n\nIn August 2000, Bobby Gould was named as manager of Division Three side Cardiff City. But two months later he handed over his duties to Alan Cork and was promoted to the role of general manager. After seeing the Bluebirds win promotion at the end of 2000–01 he left Ninian Park to seek a return to management.\n\nBobby Gould's final full-time managerial post came in February 2003 when he took over at Division Two strugglers Cheltenham Town. Despite his efforts, Cheltenham were unable to avoid relegation back to Division Three and Gould resigned soon after the 2003–04 campaign was underway, following a run of six defeats in seven games. Gould was unpopular with the fans throughout the start of 2003–04, resulting in a demonstration after the home match with Rochdale during which he came out to announce that he had resigned.\n\nIn season 2004–05 Gould was employed to coach Peterborough United by owner Barry Fry but quit at half time during an LDV Trophy match with Bristol City after a disagreement with Fry over player selection.\n\nIn September 2006 it was announced that Gould would be employed in assisting his son Jonathan who is head coach with Hawke's Bay United in New Zealand and now coaches the under 15's squad during the summer.\n\nGould appears periodically on BBC Five Live's \"Fighting Talk\" in which he has become most notorious for his dislike of being in the final or \"Defend the Indefensible\"\".\n\nHe is a regular presenter and pundit on talkSPORT Radio, and appears each Friday on the Andy Goldstein Sports Bar programme, where he is colloquially known as \"The Gouldfather\".\n\nGould was appointed as manager of Weymouth in the Conference National on 12 April 2009 for the final five games of the season. In his first game in charge Gould led Weymouth to a 1–1 draw with Forest Green Rovers which ended an 11-game losing streak, but he was unable to save them from relegation to the Conference South. He is now assistant manager at Western League side Portishead Town.\n\nMarried to Marjorie since 1968, the couple have two sons Jonathan (born 1968) and Richard (born 1970). Richard Gould is the current Chief Executive of Surrey County Cricket Club and Jonathan Gould is a former Coventry City and Celtic goalkeeper. Matt Gould, Bobby's grandson, is the current first-choice goalkeeper for Spennymoor Town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2139425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139425", "title": "The Big Show (NBC Radio)", "text": "The Big Show (NBC Radio)\n\nThe Big Show, an American radio variety program featuring 90 minutes of comic, stage, screen and music talent, was aimed at keeping American radio in its classic era alive and well against the rapidly growing television tide. For a good portion of its two-year run (November 5, 1950 – April 20, 1952), the show's quality made its ambition seem plausible.\nHosted by stage actress Tallulah Bankhead, \"The Big Show\" began November 5, 1950, on NBC with a stellar line-up of guests: Fred Allen, Mindy Carson, Jimmy Durante, José Ferrer, Portland Hoffa, Frankie Laine, Russell Knight, Paul Lukas, Ethel Merman, Danny Thomas and Meredith Willson. To make sure no one missed the launch, NBC ran in Sunday newspapers across the country an illustrated advertisement displaying headshots of Allen, Bankhead, Carson, Durante and Merman. The premiere opened with this introduction:\n\nAs she promised, on the second week's program, the guests were Groucho Marx, Jane Powell, Ezio Pinza and Fanny Brice, along with Hanley Stafford, Frank Lovejoy, David Brian and John Agar (the latter three recreating their screen roles in highlights from their current Warner Bros. picture, \"Breakthrough\"). The early shows were successful, and the program stayed on Sunday nights from 6:00-7:30pm ET for its first season, shifting to 6:30-8:00pm ET in its second. NBC went full-throttle in an attempt to keep radio from its predicted death, and \"The Big Show\" was thought to be a key to that effort. \"Newsweek\" stated it was \"the biggest bang to hit radio since TV started.\" As if to prove big bang and big bucks were mutual partners, some $100,000 could be budgeted for a single installment.\n\nThe show's success was credited to Bankhead's notorious wit and ad-libbing ability in addition to the show's superior scripting. She had one of the funniest writers in the business on her staff: Goodman Ace, the mastermind of radio's legendary \"Easy Aces\". She included renowned ad-libbers in the show—particularly Fred Allen (he and his longtime sidekick and wife, Portland Hoffa, appeared so often they could have been the show's regular co-hosts) and Groucho Marx, both of whom appeared on the first season's finale and appeared jointly on three other installments.\n\nAs Bankhead recorded in her memoirs, she took the show because she needed the money but nearly changed her mind when she feared she'd be little more than a glorified mistress of ceremonies with nothing to do but introduce the feature performers. \"Guess what happened?\" she continued. \"Your heroine emerged from the fracas as the Queen of the Kilocycles. Authorities cried out that Tallulah had redeemed radio. In shepherding my charges through \"The Big Show\", said the critics, I had snatched radio out of the grave. The autopsy was delayed.\"\n\nThe show opened each week with Bankhead quietly trumpeting the high profile of each show's guests. Those guests would then introduce themselves in alphabetical order before Bankhead finished with her own unmistakable rasp, \"And my name, darlings, is Tallulah Bankhead.\"\n\nThe show's lineup, including Allen and Marx, was a literal \"who's who\" of American entertainment of the time. They included film stars Ethel Barrymore, Charles Boyer, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Carmen Miranda, Bob Hope, Sam Levene, Martin and Lewis, Ginger Rogers, George Sanders, and Gloria Swanson; musical/comedy stage stars Eddie Cantor, Jimmy Durante, Judy Holliday and Gordon MacRae; opera stars Lauritz Melchior and Robert Merrill; and, jazz and popular music titans Andrews Sisters, Louis Armstrong, Rosemary Clooney, Perry Como, Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Goodman, The Ink Spots, Frankie Laine, Judy Garland, Édith Piaf, Frank Sinatra, Rudy Vallée and Sarah Vaughan.\n\nThe show also featured many of the nation's most familiar radio stars, some of whom were beginning to shine on the medium the show was intended to help hold at bay: Gertrude Berg (\"The Goldbergs\"), Milton Berle, Bob Cummings, Joan Davis, Ed Gardner (Archie from \"Duffy's Tavern\"), Phil Harris, Garry Moore, Jan Murray, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson (\"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\"), Phil Silvers, Danny Thomas, Paul Winchell and more.\n\nOther shows in the radio universe were referenced. \"The Big Show\"'s November 26, 1950, installment, for example, took the cast of Bankhead, Fred Allen, Jack Carson, Melchior and Ed Wynn to the fictitious Duffy's Tavern, where Ed Gardner, in character as Archie the manager, awaited them.\n\nFred Allen, who frequently joked about his own radio demise, joined Bankhead in recreating one of the best-remembered routines from Allen's old show: the \"Mr. and Mrs. Breakfast Show\" routine that ruthlessly satirized the often saccharine husband-and-wife morning shows that became something of a radio staple a decade earlier. And it was on \"The Big Show's\" premiere that Allen delivered his famous wisecrack about TV: \"Television is a new medium, and I have discovered why it's called a new medium --- because nothing is well done.\"\n\n\"\"The Big Show\" was not just more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, smoothly produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different,\" wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in \"Raised on Radio\". \"It was just a more lavish, inflated revival of radio's earliest form---the variety showcase; you could almost hear the sequins.\" Yet Nachman admired the show, which he said was \"as close to a Broadway show as radio could whip together each week.\"\n\nExcept for special tributes (the series premiere, coinciding with the anniversary of George M. Cohan's death, was a particularly slam-bang tribute: a medley of Cohan musicals' signature songs), the show usually concluded with each guest taking a turn singing a line from music director Meredith Willson's composition \"May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You\", a touch which proved sentimental but not saccharine. So did Bankhead's likewise customary sign-off, wishing \"Godspeed\" to American armed forces around the world (who also listened to the program via the Armed Forces Radio Service).\n\nIn the surviving episodes, including that first-season finale, Bankhead and her guests breeze through the comic banter and music sequences. Bankhead benefited from a first-class musical director in Willson. Ace's staff writers included Frank Wilson (who adapted movie scripts and short stories for the dramatic segments), George Foster, Mort Greene and Selma Diamond. Fred Allen, a longtime friend of Goodman Ace, contributed as well and is considered (at least by historian Nachman) to have been the show's unofficial script doctor. The show's announcers were Ed Herlihy and, when it occasionally originated from Hollywood, Jimmy Wallington.\n\n\"The Big Show\" wasn't quite big enough to put television in its place and keep it there. NBC cancelled the show after two seasons and a reported loss of $1 million, a major figure in those years. In fact, it was primarily because the program was unable to attract more advertisers than those who sustained the second half-hour segment (6:30-7:00pm) during the first season: RCA Victor, American Home Products/Whitehall Pharmacal's Anacin, and Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. The show's failure to pull the audience needed to keep it alive longer than two years might also have been due to the former NBC hits now nestling on rival CBS, including \"The Jack Benny Program\" (directly opposite \"The Big Show\"), \"Amos 'n' Andy\" and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. But \"The Big Show\" is remembered as one of the great final stands, at its best, of classic American old-time radio and---for its wit, colorful music and dramatics---as good as broadcast variety programming got on either medium.\n\nDee Englebach, producer of \"The Big Show\", attempted to recreate the radio program's success on television with \"All Star Revue\", and Bankhead signed on as one of the rotating hosts, essentially repeating the comedy antics and musical variety of \"The Big Show\" in front of cameras, beginning October 11, 1952, with guest line-up that included Groucho Marx, Ethel Barrymore, Ben Grauer, and Meredith Willson. She continued to host that TV series until April 18, 1953.\n\nIn the spring of 1980, a 90-minute TV series titled \"The Big Show\", premiered on NBC. Nominated for several Emmy Awards, it nevertheless died a quick death after only a few months. Keith Olbermann's first MSNBC news show, which aired from 1997 to 1998, was titled \"The Big Show with Keith Olbermann\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2139436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139436", "title": "Snow chains", "text": "Snow chains\n\nSnow chains, or tire chains, are devices fitted to the tires of vehicles to provide maximum traction when driving through snow and ice.\n\nSnow chains attach to the drive wheels of a vehicle or special systems deploy chains which swing under the tires automatically. Although named after steel chain, snow chains may be made of other materials and in a variety of patterns and strengths. Chains are usually sold in pairs and often must be purchased to match a particular tire size (tire diameter and tread width), although some designs can be adjusted to fit various sizes of tire. Driving with chains reduces fuel efficiency, and can reduce the allowable speed of the automobile to approximately , but increase traction and braking on snowy or icy surfaces. Some regions require chains to be used under some weather conditions, but other areas prohibit the use of chains, as they can deteriorate road surfaces .\n\nSnow chains were invented in 1904 by Harry D. Weed in Canastota, New York. Weed received for his \"Grip-Tread for Pneumatic Tires\" on August 23, 1904. Weed's great-grandson, James Weed, said that Harry got the idea of creating chains for tires when he saw drivers wrap rope, or even vines, around their tires to increase traction on muddy or snowy roads, which were very common at the turn of the 20th century. (At this time, most people in rural Northern regions wouldn't bother driving automobiles in the winter at all, since roads were usually rolled for use with horse-drawn sleighs, rather than plowed. Automobiles were generally not winter vehicles, for a variety of reasons until the 1930s or 1940s in some areas. Only in urban areas was it possible to remove snow from streets.). He sought to make a traction device that was more durable and would work with snow as well as mud.\n\nIn July 1935, the Canadian Auguste Trudeau obtained a patent for his tread and anti-skidding chain.\n\nIn snowy conditions, transportation authorities may require that snow chains or other traction aids be installed on vehicles, or at least supplied for them. This can apply to all vehicles, or only those without other traction aids, such as four-wheel drive or special tires. Local requirements may be enforced at checkpoints or by other type of inspection. Snow chains should be installed on one or more drive axles of the vehicle, with requirements varying for dual-tire or multi-driven-axle vehicles that range from \"one pair of tires on a driven axle\" to \"all tires on all driven axles\", possibly also one or both steering (front) wheels, requiring snow chains whenever required by signage or conditions.\n\nIn case of running wheel loaders, it is recommended to use special protection chains due to intense pressure on tires during work.\n\nTires come with standardized tire code sizing information, found on the sidewalls of the tires. The first letter(s), indicate the vehicle type (P for passenger, LT for light truck). The next three digits indicate the tire's width in millimeters. The middle two digit number indicates the tire's height-to-width ratio. The next character is a letter \"R\", which indicates radial ply tires (rather than radius). followed by a final two digit number indicating the rim size for the vehicle's wheels.\n\nAdditionally, the correct Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) class of snow chains must be installed, based on the wheel clearance of the vehicle.\nThe SAE Class \"S\" well clearance is a common requirement on newer cars, especially if after-market wider, low-profile, or larger tires and/or wheels are fitted.\n\nThe classes are defined as follows:\n\n\n\nTire chains are available in a variety of types that have different advantages of cost, ride smoothness, traction, durability, ease of installation, and recommended travel speed.\n\nMaterials include steel (in the form of links or cables), polyurethane, rubber, and fabric. The original-style steel-link chains are also available in a variety of carbon steel and steel alloys and link shapes. Link shapes include standard, twisted, square, and reinforced. The shape of the links changes the flexibility, grip, and strength of the chain. The links can also have added studs or V-bars for an even more aggressive traction. The use of alloy steel and hardened steel adds durability. Traction cables (cable chains, snow cables) attach like chains but are made from cable rather than chain.\n\nChain patterns include the ladder, diagonal, or pattern types. Ladder type chains have \"cross chains\" perpendicular to the road and look like a ladder when carefully laid on the ground. With diagonal chains, the cross chains are diagonal to the road. Pattern types form a \"net\" over the tire such as a diamond or multiple diamond pattern. Some industrial pattern types also include studded, metal rings to which the chains attach and thus are called \"ring chains\".\n\nMost tire chains are wrapped around the circumference of the tires and held in place with \"rim chains\", which may be chain or cable, elastic or adjustable \"tensioners\". Automatic chains do not wrap around the tire but swing under the tire from devices permanently mounted under the vehicle which deploy via an electronic solenoid activated in the cab. Some tire chains mount onto the tires from only one side. Others use a ratcheting system for easier installation.\n\nAlternatives include studded tires, which are snow tires with metal studs individually mounted into holes in the treads; emergency traction devices which may be similar to tire chains but mount around the tire through openings in the rim; and snow socks, which are fabric rather than chain or cable. These allow higher operating speeds and don't require the operator to install them (studs), but chains generally give the best traction in severe conditions.\n\n\"Mud chains\" are similar to snow chains but for off-road, four-wheel drive applications, and generally they are larger than snow chains; they are often seen on heavy off-road equipment like log skidders, which have to operate over very rough, muddy terrain.\n\n\"Wheel tracks\" are heavy duty assemblies similar to chains but with rigid cross links such as sometimes used on logging equipment.\n\nLaws vary considerably regarding the legality of snow chain use.

He was captain and central midfield player during the 1970s and was a key player in the QPR side which came close to winning their first-ever league title in 1976. He won 12 caps for the England team between 1974 and 1976, and was captain for eight of those matches. His International career was limited by a persistent back injury. He left QPR for Crystal Palace in 1979, although he subsequently returned to QPR for a 2nd spell, before a move to Coventry City. However this was a time when he suffered injury problems.\n\nIn August 1983, he was appointed player-manager of Exeter City although they endured a difficult season. Francis then had further short playing spells at Cardiff City, Swansea City and Portsmouth before a move to Bristol Rovers in 1985 yielded 32 league appearances, where he ended his playing career in 1987.\n\nFollowing this playing spell he succeeded Bobby Gould as manager of Third Division side Bristol Rovers. In 1990, he guided the Pirates to the Third Division title and thus they won promotion to the Second Division, but a year later he returned to QPR as manager.\n\nIn 1992–93, QPR finished fifth in the inaugural Premier League – the highest placed of all the London teams. They finished ninth in 1993–94 and eighth in 1994–95, but in November 1994, Francis left Loftus Road for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nDuring his three years in charge at QPR, Francis fielded a side containing some of the most feared players in the top flight. Arguably the finest player at the club during this time was striker Les Ferdinand, who had joined the club from non-league Hayes in 1986 but not established himself in the first team until the season before Francis arrived, when he scored eight goals in 18 First Division games. Francis kept faith in Ferdinand, and was rewarded in 1992–93 when the player hit 20 league goals in one season. Ferdinand remained at QPR until his £6million transfer to Newcastle in 1995, by which time he had scored 78 goals in five league campaigns and was one of the most feared strikers in England, being capped for the first time in 1993. In July 1997, while manager of Tottenham Hotspur, Francis signed Ferdinand for £6million.\n\nWith the resignation of Graham Taylor as England national football team manager in November 1993 following failure to qualify for the World Cup, Francis was one of the many names linked to the vacancy, but the job went to Terry Venables instead. In March 1994, ambitious Division One club Wolverhampton Wanderers made a lucrative approach for Francis to drop down a division and take charge of the club looking to make the breakthrough to the Premier League, but he rejected the offer and Wolves turned to Graham Taylor instead.\n\n1994–95 was a 'nearly' season for Tottenham. They finished seventh in the Premier League – two places off a UEFA Cup place – and lost to Everton in the semi finals of the FA Cup. Mid table finishes in the next two seasons were unconvincing and Francis resigned in November 1997 with Spurs battling against relegation from the Premier League. During his time at Tottenham Francis became resented by the fans over his handling of star player Darren Anderton. It has been argued that Francis is largely responsible for Anderton's recurring injuries, placing him in the team without sufficient time to recover, which resulted in Anderton's appearing in only eight games in the 1995–96 season and 17 games in the 1996–97 season.\n\nIn September 1998, Gerry Francis was named as QPR manager for the second time. They had slumped since his departure four years earlier and were now Division One strugglers. He kept them clear of relegation over the next two seasons before finally resigning in February 2001 with a return to the lower half of the league imminent after more than 30 years. He briefly became Director of Football at QPR before beginning his second spell as manager of Bristol Rovers in June 2001.\n\nThree successive wins at the start of the 2001–02 campaign gave the Pirates hope for promotion back to Division Two, but injuries soon took their toll on the side's form and Francis resigned just before Christmas. The Pirates continued to slide and missed out on relegation to the Conference by just one place. Gerry Francis worked with Graham Muxworthy and Ian Holloway whilst at Bristol Rovers. Francis has not been in management since.\n\nOn 4 October 2008, he was offered a position of first team coach at Newcastle United, however due to the uncertainty over the period of the role he decided to take up an offer from Stoke City to become their first team coach. He left Stoke at the end of the 2012–13 season.\n\nFrancis followed former Stoke manager Tony Pulis to Crystal Palace when he became a coach under Pulis at the London club. Following Pulis's surprise departure from the club in August 2014 Francis remained in his position in order to assist caretaker manager Keith Millen. However, on 28 August 2014, following the appointment of Neil Warnock as manager it was announced by the club that Francis had left.\n\nFrancis was a Brentford supporter as a youth and his father Roy was a professional at the club in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His sons Adam and Jake were academy players at Queens Park Rangers.\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

He became a regular first team player the following campaign, when they were promoted and he stayed loyal to the club even when they were relegated again in 1982, being a key player in the side that then won the Fourth Division title in 1983, won promotion from the Third Division a year later, and completed a four-season rise to the First Division in 1986 when they gained promotion from the Second Division in only their ninth season as a Football League team. After their promotion in 1986, Wimbledon rose to the top of the First Division in early September before finishing sixth at the end of the 1986–87 season.\n\nHe became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final when he blocked John Aldridge's spot-kick for Liverpool in 1988, and in doing so helped Wimbledon secure a 1–0 win. He was also the first ever goalkeeper to captain his team in an FA Cup final. His ability to kick the ball some considerable distance fitted in well with the \"long ball\" style of play Wimbledon were known for in the 1980s, nor was he afraid to move out of the area and upfield before kicking the ball, or to take free kicks.\n\nHowever, the 1988 FA Cup final was the last game that Beasant played for Wimbledon. A month later he was sold to Newcastle United for £850,000.\n\nBeasant's spell on Tyneside was brief as the Magpies struggled and were finally relegated from the First Division in bottom place. Beasant had left in January 1989 to join Chelsea. He immediately became first choice keeper, replacing Roger Freestone.\n\nIn September 1992, two mistakes in a match against Norwich City led to Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield telling the media that Beasant would never play for the club again, although in fact he returned to the side when Porterfield was sacked later that season.\n\nDuring the 1993–94 season Beasant sustained an unusual injury when, while making a sandwich in his kitchen, he dropped a 2 kg glass bottle of salad cream on his foot, severing the tendon to his big toe. As a result, he missed eight weeks of the season.\n\nFollowing the arrival of new manager, Glenn Hoddle, who opted for Dmitri Kharine as his first choice keeper with Kevin Hitchcock in reserve, Beasant was unable to get back into the Chelsea squad and looked for a new club.\n\nBeasant signed for Southampton in November 1993 for a fee of £300,000 to replace the recently departed Tim Flowers. Beasant made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at Everton on 4 December; despite a run of four defeats, his confidence gradually returned and he soon became a favourite with The Dell crowd. With the departure of Ian Branfoot and his replacement as manager by Alan Ball, the \"Saints\" eventually climbed out of the relegation zone, finishing the 1993–94 season one point above relegated Sheffield United.\n\nAt the start of the 1994–95 season, he was replaced by Bruce Grobbelaar but was restored as first-choice keeper for the last month of the season. Following Alan Ball's move to Manchester City in the summer of 1995, new manager Dave Merrington preferred Beasant in goal. The team struggled throughout the season, and were never far from the relegation zone, but finished level on points but with a better goal difference than Ball's Manchester City who were relegated. Beasant himself finished the season by being voted the club's Player of the Season.\n\nFor the 1996–97 season, Graeme Souness was appointed manager; initially, Souness kept faith with Beasant but after a series of injuries (during which Saints took Chris Woods on loan), Souness signed Maik Taylor from Barnet in January. Beasant's final first-team game for Southampton was a 1–0 defeat against Liverpool on 29 December 1996. Following the arrival of Paul Jones in the summer of 1997, Beasant was now only third-choice 'keeper, and after a loan move to Nottingham Forest in August 1997, the transfer was made permanent in November. In his four years at The Dell, he made a total of 105 appearances in all competitions.\n\nIn November 1997, he signed for Nottingham Forest at 38 years old, after a short period on loan. He spent four years at the City Ground, during which time they were relegated from the Premier League one season after promotion. He went on to become Forest's oldest ever player at 42. He then signed for Portsmouth in August 2001 after their regular goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan was killed in a car crash.\n\nIn November 2001 Beasant terminated his contract at Portsmouth and signed for Tottenham Hotspur on a two-month contract.\n\nHe played his last competitive game in the 2002–03 season for Brighton & Hove Albion in Division One at the age of 43, although he did spend the 2003–04 season registered as a player with Fulham in the FA Premier League. By then he was the oldest player registered with any professional club and the last in England with a 1950s birthdate. He came out of retirement on 17 August 2013 to play for Southern League Division One Central club North Greenford United in a 2–0 defeat against Chalfont St Peter.\n\nHaving joined Stevenage as the club's goalkeeping coach in the middle of 2014, Beasant was named as a substitute for an away match at Carlisle United on 11 October 2014, aged 55.\n\nBeasant was selected to play two full international matches for England by manager Bobby Robson. The first of Beasant's two England caps came at Wembley Stadium on 15 November 1989 against Italy in a friendly match, where he replaced Peter Shilton as a half-time substitute and kept a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw. The following month on 13 December, also at Wembley, he made his second appearance in a friendly against Yugoslavia, again as a half-time substitute in a 2–1 win for England. He was a member of England's 1990 FIFA World Cup squad, having been called up after David Seaman had to withdraw through injury.\n\nBy the time of his retirement, Beasant had been appointed as a goalkeeping coach at Fulham in addition to serving as goalkeeping coach for Northern Ireland under former Wimbledon teammate Lawrie Sanchez. Beasant resigned from the Northern Ireland post in 2007 after Sanchez was appointed Fulham manager only for the pair to both be sacked by the club in December 2007.\n\nBeasant was a senior coach at the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He joined in 2008 and worked not only with the Academy's goalkeepers, but also outfield players, especially defenders. In August 2012, Beasant was appointed part-time goalkeeper coach at Bristol Rovers. In July 2014, he became goalkeeping coach at Stevenage where he joined his son Sam Beasant. On 25 June 2015, he was appointed as goalkeeping coach at Reading. On 22 December 2018, Beasant was released after the club appointed Jose Gomes to replace Paul Clement as manager.\n\nWimbledon\n\nChelsea\n\nNottingham Forest\n"}
{"id": "2139512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139512", "title": "Alcmaeon of Croton", "text": "Alcmaeon of Croton\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton (; , \"Alkmaiōn\", \"gen\".: Ἀλκμαίωνος; fl. 5th century BC) has been described as one of the most eminent natural philosophers and medical theorists of antiquity. He has been referred to as \"a thinker of considerable originality and one of the greatest philosophers, naturalists, and neuroscientists of all time.\" His work in biology has been described as remarkable, and his originality made him likely a pioneer. Because of difficulties dating Alcmaeon's birth, his importance has been neglected.\n\nAlcmaeon was born in Croton and was the son of Peirithous. Alcmaeon is said by some to have been a pupil of Pythagoras, and he is believed to have been born c. 510 BC. Although he wrote primarily about medical topics, there is some suggestion that he was a philosopher of science, not a physician. He also practiced astrology and meteorology. Nothing more is known of the events of his life.\n\nDuring Alcmaeon's time, the medical school in Magna Graecia was regarded as the most famous; illnesses were studied in a scientific and experimental manner. Alcmaeon was considered by many an early pioneer and advocate of anatomical dissection and was said to be the first to identify Eustachian tubes. His celebrated discoveries in the field of dissection were noted in antiquity, but whether his knowledge in this branch of science was derived from the dissection of animals or of human bodies is disputed. Calcidius, on whose authority the fact rests, merely says \"\"qui primus exsectionem aggredi est ausus\",\" and the word \"exsectio\" would apply equally well in either case; some modern scholars doubt Calcidius' word entirely.\n\nAlcmaeon also was the first to dwell on the internal causes of illnesses. It was he who first suggested that health was a state of equilibrium between opposing humors and that illnesses were because of problems in environment, nutrition and lifestyle. A book titled \"On Nature\" is attributed to him, though the original title may be different. According to Favorinus's account, Alcmaeon has been the first who wrote such a treatise on natural philosophy (), however this has been disputed, because Anaximander wrote before Alcmaeon. Accounts which attribute an Alcmaeon of Croton to be the first to write animal fables, may be a reference to a poet with the same name. He also wrote several other medical and philosophical works, of which nothing but the titles and a few fragments have been preserved by Stobaeus, Plutarch, and Galen.\n\nSurviving fragments attributed to Alcmaeon include, \"The earth is the mother of plants and the sun their father\", and may be also, \"Experience is the beginning of learning\", attributed to an Spartan poet named Alcman.\nCalcidius' commentary on Plato's \"Timaeus\" praises Alcmaeon (as well as Callisthenes and Herophilus), about their work on the nature of the eye. He mentions that Alcmaeon excised an animal eye to study the optic nerve. However, there is no evidence that Alcmaeon himself dissected the eye or the skull. Based on this observation, and more rudimentary, Alcmaeon described the senses, except for the touch sense. These observations contributed to the study of medicine by establishing the connection between the brain and the sense organs, and outlined the paths of the optic nerves as well as stating that the brain is the organ of the mind. Many scholars believe that Plato referred to Alcmaeon's work, when writing in Phaedo about the senses and how we or animals think. He also stated that the eye contains both fire and water, with vision occurring once something is seen and reflected by the gleaming and translucent part of the eye.\n\nAlcmaeon said that sleep occurs by the withdrawal of blood, away from the surface of the body, to larger blood-flowing vessels, and that one becomes awake again once the blood returns. And if the blood withdraws entirely, death occurs. It has been suggested that Hippocratic authors, and Aristotle, adopted Alcmaeon’s views on sleep. There are also accounts of him about embryology, how a child develops, and analogies with animals and plants about human physiology. Because of the little evidence, there exists controversy to what extent Alcmaeon can be considered as a Presocratic cosmologist, or if at all.\n\nAlthough Alcmaeon is often described as a pupil of Pythagoras, there are reasons to doubt whether he was a Pythagorean at all; his name seems to have crept into lists of Pythagoreans given us by later writers. Aristotle mentions him as nearly contemporary with Pythagoras, but distinguishes between the \"stoicheia\" () of opposites, under which the Pythagoreans included all things; and the double principle of Alcmaeon, according to Aristotle, less extended, although he does not explain the precise difference. Since 1950 the scholarly consensus holds that Alcmaeon of Croton is a figure independent of the Pythagoreans.\n\nOther doctrines of Alcmaeon have been preserved. He said that the human soul was immortal and partook of the divine nature, because like the heavenly bodies it contained in itself a principle of motion. The eclipse of the moon, which was also eternal, he supposed to arise from its shape, which he said was like a boat. All his doctrines which have come down to us relate to physics or medicine; and seem to have arisen partly out of the speculations of the Ionian School, with which rather than the Pythagorean, Aristotle appears to connect Alcmaeon, partly from the traditional lore of the earliest medical science.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2139542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139542", "title": "Point Bolivar Light", "text": "Point Bolivar Light\n\nPoint Bolivar Light is a historic lighthouse in Port Bolivar, Texas, that was built in 1872. It served for 61 years before being retired in 1933, when its function was replaced by a different light.\n\nThe current lighthouse is at least the second structure at the site. The first lighthouse was built in 1852 of cast iron made at the Baltimore foundry of Murray and Hazlehurst, and was pulled down during the Civil War so that Union warships could not use it as a navigational aid.\n\nDuring the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, the lighthouse served as a shelter for at least 125 people, saving their lives. In 1915, the lighthouse also survived another hurricane, where winds of 126 miles per hour were recorded. The first lighthouse keeper, H. C. Claiborne, retired in 1918, after witnessing those two storms, and was replaced by a Captain J. Brooks. From the 1890s until the line's abandonment in 1942, the lighthouse looked down on the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway line that ran between it and Texas State Highway 87. In 1947, the lighthouse was sold and, although still standing, is not open to the public. The 1970 film \"My Sweet Charlie\", starring Patty Duke and Al Freeman Jr. was filmed at the lighthouse and adjacent caretaker's house.\n\nThe War Department took possession of the lighthouse in 1935. It was transferred to the War Assets Administration, sold to rancher Elmer V. Boyt, and remains in the family.\n\nAfter withstanding over 150 years of erosion, the lighthouse is now entirely black. This has caused some to call it \"The Haunted Lighthouse\" of Bolivar.\nThe lighthouse is adjacent to the Houston Audubon Society's Horseshoe Marsh Bird Sanctuary.\n\n\n"}
